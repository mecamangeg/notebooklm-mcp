I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF ROBERTO TING TONG TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. ROBERTO TING TONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-21138, November 27, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Roberto Ting Tong initiated naturalization proceedings on December 29, 1959 [1]. At the time of filing, he had a ten-year-old son, Ting Chua Lu, who was residing in Hong Kong and was not enrolled in any public or private school in the Philippines [1, 2]. The child only arrived in the Philippines on May 24, 1960 [1]. The Court of First Instance of Manila issued an order refusing to allow the petitioner to take his oath of allegiance, ruling that he lacked the qualifications prescribed in Paragraph 6, Section 2 of the Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473) [1, 3]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that under *Pritchard v. Republic*, the enrollment requirement could be satisfied "any time during the entire period of the residence," noting that his son was enrolled in a local school soon after arrival and before the lower court's order [1, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner’s failure to enroll his minor child in a Philippine school prior to the hearing of the petition disqualifies him from naturalization.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order refusing the oath [5]. The Court held that the petitioner's contention was untenable because it contradicted the "explicit tenor" of Paragraph 6, Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, which mandates that the enrollment of minor children in Philippine schools must take place **"prior to the hearing"** of the petition for naturalization, not subsequently [1, 6].

The Court ruled that the petitioner's reliance on *Pritchard v. Republic* was misplaced, as that decision is inconsistent with subsequent rulings such as *Yrostorza v. Republic*, *Lim Lian Hong v. Republic*, and *Tan Hi v. Republic* [1, 7]. These later cases prevail over *Pritchard*, establishing that failure to enroll minor children prior to the hearing is fatal to the petition [7]. Consequently, the order appealed from was affirmed [5].
