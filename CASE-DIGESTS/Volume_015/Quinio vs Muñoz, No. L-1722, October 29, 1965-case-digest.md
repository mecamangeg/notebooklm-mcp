I. CAPTION
NIEVES QUINIO, ET AL. v. MARCELO MUÑOZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-1722, October 29, 1965, 15 SCRA 140, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On May 25, 1957, Artemio Velosa and Victor Gamab were killed while fixing a tire on a provincial road in Laguna when they were hit by a speeding pick-up truck owned by Daniel Miranda and driven by Marcelo Muñoz [1]. The truck was delivering newspapers for the *Manila Chronicle* and *Philippines Herald* under a "Carriage Agreement" with Miranda [1, 2]. The agreement required Miranda to deliver newspapers along a fixed route within four hours of receipt, imposed fines for delays, and required him to provide replacement vehicles if necessary [3, 4].

Muñoz was convicted of double homicide through reckless imprudence in the criminal case [5]. In the civil action for damages filed by the heirs of the victims (petitioners), the Court of First Instance of Batangas held Muñoz and Miranda liable for damages but absolved the *Chronicle* and *Herald* [5, 6]. The lower court ruled that the relationship between the newspapers and Miranda was that of shippers and carrier, not employers and employee [5]. Petitioners appealed, arguing the newspapers exercised control over the carrier, creating an employer-employee relationship under Article 2180 of the Civil Code [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N an employer-employee relationship existed between the newspaper companies and the carrier (Miranda).
2. W/N the newspaper companies are liable under Article 377 of the Code of Commerce.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that no employer-employee relationship existed. Applying the "control test," the Court found that the conditions specified in the Carriage Agreement—such as the fixed route, the four-hour delivery limit, and penalties for delay—were designed solely to secure the accomplishment of a result: the distribution of newspapers [9]. The carrier was subject to control only as to the result, but was free to choose his own means and methods [9]. Furthermore, Miranda was engaged in a distinct occupation as an owner/operator of a truck for hire, evidenced by his vehicle's "TH" plate [10]. Consequently, the newspaper companies are not vicariously liable for the negligence of the carrier's driver under Article 2180 of the Civil Code [8, 9].

2. **NO.** Article 377 of the Code of Commerce, which governs the liability of carriers and shippers, is inapplicable because it applies only in the absence of a contract between the parties [11, 12]. Here, a specific Carriage Agreement governed the relationship [2]. Additionally, the petitioners raised this theory for the first time on a motion for reconsideration, which constitutes a prohibited change of theory [12].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [13].
