I. CAPTION
**ANDRES E. LAZARO v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS**, G.R. Nos. L-21790 & L-21794, December 24, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
In 1954, petitioner Andres Lazaro imported various shipments of foodstuffs and goods from Hong Kong. The Collector of Customs of Manila seized the importations for lacking the Central Bank release certificate required by Central Bank Circulars 44 and 45, in relation to the Revised Administrative Code [1]. Pending seizure proceedings, the goods were released to Lazaro upon the posting of surety bonds [1].

For the seizure proceedings, the Collector appraised the goods based on their invoice value, adding charges and a 30% estimated profit to determine their value in the local market, pursuant to Section 1377 of the Revised Administrative Code [1]. Lazaro and his sureties based their bond amounts on this appraisal [1]. The Collector declared the goods forfeited. This ruling was affirmed by the Commissioner of Customs and the Court of Tax Appeals [2]. Lazaro appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the validity of the forfeiture, the applicability of subsequent laws (RA 1410 and CB Circular 133), and the inclusion of the 30% estimated profit in the appraisal [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the importations are subject to forfeiture for lack of a Central Bank release certificate.
2. W/N Republic Act No. 1410 and Central Bank Circular 133 repealed Central Bank Circulars 44 and 45.
3. W/N the 30% estimated profits should be included in the appraised value of the forfeited goods.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Importations made without Central Bank release certificates violate Central Bank Circulars 44 and 45 in relation to Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code and are subject to forfeiture [3, 4]. The Court reiterated its previous ruling in *Serree Investment Company v. Commissioner of Customs* regarding this matter [3].

2. **NO.** Central Bank Circular 133 did not repeal Circulars 44 and 45. Paragraph 6 of Circular 133 explicitly requires the presentation of a release certificate, and Paragraph 8 incorporates existing circulars not inconsistent with its provisions [4, 5]. Furthermore, Republic Act 1410, enacted on September 10, 1955, does not apply to goods that were already imported and declared forfeited prior to its enactment [6, 7].

3. **YES.** While Rule 13(a) of the Philippine Tariff Act of 1909 applies to appraisal for determining customs duties, Section 1377 of the Revised Administrative Code governs appraisal in seizure proceedings, which requires using the "value in the local market" [7-9]. The 30% estimated profit was correctly included to reflect this local value. Moreover, the petitioner acquiesced to this valuation when he posted bonds covering said amount, creating a contractual obligation to pay the estimated profits in case of forfeiture [10, 11].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **AFFIRMED** [11].
