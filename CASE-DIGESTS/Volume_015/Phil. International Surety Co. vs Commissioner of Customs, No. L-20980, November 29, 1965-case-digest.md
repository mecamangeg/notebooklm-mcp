I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINES INTERNATIONAL SURETY COMPANY, INC. v. COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-20980, November 29, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On August 17, 1955, 187 bales of cotton textiles consigned to Rosol Dry Goods arrived in Manila but lacked the required Central Bank release certificate [1]. The goods were subjected to seizure proceedings but were released under a bond posted by petitioner Philippines International Surety Company, Inc. [2]. The Collector of Customs later decreed the forfeiture of the bonds and ordered both Rosol Dry Goods and the petitioner, jointly and severally, to pay P247,962.15 representing the value of the goods [2].

Both appealed to the Respondent Commissioner of Customs, who affirmed the Collector's decision [2, 3]. The petitioner appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), but Rosol Dry Goods did not [3]. The CTA dismissed the petitioner's appeal on the ground that, being a mere surety, it had no legal capacity to appeal as it was not "adversely affected" under Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125 [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the surety of a consignee in a seizure proceeding has the legal standing to appeal a decision of the Commissioner of Customs to the Court of Tax Appeals.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner has the right to appeal. Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125 broadly allows "any person, association or corporation adversely affected" by a decision of the Commissioner of Customs to appeal to the CTA [4, 5].

In this case, the Commissioner's decision declared the petitioner liable, jointly and severally with the consignee, for the payment of P247,962.15 [5]. Since the petitioner is the bondsman and must answer for the liability resulting from the forfeiture, it is pecuniarily and adversely affected by the decision [6, 7]. The Court emphasized that the law does not limit the right of appeal to importers or consignees, and to deny the surety this right would deprive it of its day in court and property without due process of law [7, 8].

The resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings [9].
