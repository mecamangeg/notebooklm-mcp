I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF ANTONIO PO TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. ANTONIO PO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-21019, December 24, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Antonio Po, born of Chinese parents in Surigao, applied for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Surigao. To prove he possessed a lucrative trade or occupation, he claimed employment as a collector for the Surigao Chamber of Commerce with a salary of P250.00 a month [1]. He also received free board and lodging from his widowed mother and claimed additional income from helping in her store [1]. The government opposed the petition on the ground that his income was not lucrative. The CFI admitted Po to Philippine citizenship, prompting the Republic to appeal to the Supreme Court [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Antonio Po possesses a lucrative trade or occupation sufficient to qualify for naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. An income of P250.00 a month is not considered lucrative within the purview of the Naturalization Law [4, 5]. While the Court previously held in *Ong v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-15764) that income below P250.00 is not lucrative, it does not follow that reaching this bracket satisfies the requirement, given the rising cost of living and the low purchasing power of money [5, 6].

Furthermore, Po's employment lacked stability because his position depended on the incumbent president of the Chamber of Commerce, who is elected annually [3, 5]. His claim of additional income was uncorroborated by witnesses or tax returns, and his reliance on free board and lodging indicated he was still dependent on his mother for support [7, 8].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the decree admitting Antonio Po to naturalization is **SET ASIDE** [8].
