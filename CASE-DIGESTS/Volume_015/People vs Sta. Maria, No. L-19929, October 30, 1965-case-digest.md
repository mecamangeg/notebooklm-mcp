I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MANUEL STA. MARIA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19929, October 30, 1965, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On December 15, 1959, Domingo Sanqui was kidnapped from his barn in San Miguel, Bulacan, by a group including appellants Manuel Sta. Maria, Francisco Sta. Maria, and Ignacio de Guzman, alongside four others (Juanito dela Cruz, Restituto dela Cruz, Alfonso Balinguit, and Ruperto Santos). A ransom note demanding P30,000.00, written by Manuel under Ignacio's instruction, was found. The victim was taken to the mountains of Tela Kawa. There, upon Francisco's order, Balinguit shot the victim, and upon Manuel's order, Santos hacked the victim's neck, killing him.

In the Court of First Instance, the four cohorts pleaded guilty and were sentenced to death. Manuel, Francisco, and Ignacio went to trial, were found guilty of kidnapping with murder, and also sentenced to death. On automatic review, appellants argued that the guilty pleas were made without understanding the consequences, that their extrajudicial confessions were involuntary, and that conspiracy was not proven.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused who pleaded guilty understood the consequences of their plea.
2. W/N the extrajudicial confessions were voluntary and admissible.
3. W/N conspiracy was established.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The record shows the accused were assisted by counsel and changed their pleas from "not guilty" to "guilty" voluntarily. They persisted in their plea despite the trial court's specific admonition that it would result in the imposition of the death penalty [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The voluntariness of the confessions was supported by the testimony of the Municipal Judge, who certified that the affiants read, swore to, and signed the statements freely in the presence of witnesses. The intervention of the Justice of the Peace guarantees regularity, and claims of intimidation were unsubstantiated by evidence [3, 4].

3. **YES.** The confessions of Manuel, Francisco, and Ignacio corroborated the extrajudicial confessions of the other four accused. While an extrajudicial confession is generally evidence only against the maker, it serves as corroborative evidence when clear facts show other persons participated in the crime, as established in *People v. Padilla* (48 Phil. 725) [5, 6].

**Disposition:** The decision is **AFFIRMED** with **MODIFICATION**. The death penalty for Manuel Sta. Maria, Francisco Sta. Maria, and Ignacio de Guzman is affirmed. The penalty for Restituto dela Cruz, Juanito dela Cruz, Alfonso Balinguit, and Ruperto Santos is commuted to *reclusión perpetua* due to their plea of guilty.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (The decision was unanimous/Per Curiam).
