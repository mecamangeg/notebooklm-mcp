I. CAPTION
BENEDICTO LAMBONAO v. ALFREDO O. TERO and DANIEL B. VESTAL (consolidated with *Lua v. Lagumbay* and *Japson v. Gazon*), G.R. Nos. L-23240, L-23241, & L-23242, December 31, 1965, 15 SCRA 716, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Benedicto Lambonao, Ariston Lua, Leodegario Japson, and Francisco Golpe were candidates for various local offices (municipal councilors and vice-mayor) in Southern Leyte during the November 12, 1963 elections [1-3]. After the municipal board of canvassers proclaimed the respondents as the winning candidates, petitioners filed separate petitions for *quo warranto* challenging the respondents' eligibility [1-3].

In G.R. No. L-23240, Lambonao alleged that the certificates of candidacy (COCs) of the winning councilors were forged and not personally signed by them [1]. In G.R. Nos. L-23241 and L-23242, petitioners alleged that the respondents' COCs failed to include the information on income, taxes, and waivers required by Section 32 of the Revised Election Code [2-4]. The Court of First Instance of Southern Leyte dismissed all petitions for lack of cause of action, ruling that the alleged defects should have been questioned on or before the election [1, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defects in the respondents' certificates of candidacy, raised only after their proclamation, are sufficient grounds to annul their election.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the petitions [5].

The Court held that while Sections 31 and 32 of the Revised Election Code regarding the filing and contents of certificates of candidacy are mandatory in terms, they are construed as **directory after the elections** [6]. This rule of interpretation is established to give effect to the will of the electorate [6]. The Court relied on the doctrine in *De Guzman v. Board of Canvassers* and *Lino Luna v. Rodriguez*, stating that laws adopted to assist voters should not be used to defeat the object of the election [6, 7].

Defects in the certificate of candidacy—such as lack of a sworn statement or missing tax information—must be questioned on or before the election [5, 8]. Once the people have honestly expressed their will through the ballots, the result cannot be defeated by technical defects that could have been corrected prior to the election [8]. Public interest prevails over that of the defeated candidate [8].

**Orders affirmed.**
