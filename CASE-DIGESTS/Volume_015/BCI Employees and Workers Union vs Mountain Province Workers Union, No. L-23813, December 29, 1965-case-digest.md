I. CAPTION
BCI EMPLOYEES AND WORKERS UNION (PAPLU) v. MOUNTAIN PROVINCE WORKERS UNION, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23813, December 29, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On November 16, 1963, respondent Mountain Province Workers Union filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) for a certification election among the rank-and-file employees of Benguet Consolidated, Inc. [1]. During the hearing on January 11, 1964, petitioner BCI Employees and Workers Union failed to appear, and the CIR ordered the certification election in open court [2]. Petitioner subsequently filed an opposition on January 15, 1964, arguing that it had already been certified as the sole bargaining representative in an election held on August 22, 1962, and that it had not yet secured a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) because the former agreement had not yet expired [3-5]. The CIR denied the opposition for being filed out of time and denied the subsequent motion for reconsideration [3, 6]. Petitioner appealed, contending the CIR erred in ordering a new election.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR properly ordered a new certification election despite the petitioner being certified as the exclusive bargaining agent 15 months prior.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the CIR did not abuse its discretion. Under Section 12(b) of Republic Act No. 875, the court shall not order a certification election in the same unit more often than once in 12 months [4]. In this case, more than 15 months had elapsed since the petitioner's certification on August 22, 1962, which justifies the holding of a new election [4, 5]. Regarding the petitioner's failure to secure a CBA, the Court ruled that the only consideration is whether the union had "reasonable time" to conclude a contract [5]. Having had 15 months, the petitioner cannot complain of a lack of time, and its failure to conclude an agreement is its own concern [5].

Petition denied [7].
