I. CAPTION
IN RE: PETITION FOR CANCELLATION OF CONDITION ANNOTATED ON TRANSFER CERTIFICATE OF TITLE No. 54417, QUEZON CITY; DRA. RAFAELA V. TRIAS v. GREGORIO ARANETA, INC., G.R. No. L-20786, October 30, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rafaela Trias, the registered owner of a subdivision lot in Quezon City, filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Rizal to cancel an annotation on her Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) which stated: "That no factories will be permitted in this section" [1, 2]. She argued that the restriction impaired her dominical rights and was mere surplusage because existing zoning ordinances already prohibited factories in the district [2]. The restriction was originally imposed by the subdivision owner, J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. (through oppositor-appellant Gregorio Araneta, Inc.), in the contract of sale to the original purchasers to ensure the area remained residential [3, 4]. The lower court granted the petition, agreeing that the restriction was surplusage [2]. Araneta, Inc. appealed, arguing the restriction was a valid contractual obligation [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the prohibition against factories annotated on the title is a valid limitation on ownership.
2. W/N the existence of a zoning ordinance prohibiting factories renders the contractual annotation surplusage and subject to cancellation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The prohibition is a valid contractual obligation and easement. The Court held that such a restriction is similar to an easement, which an owner of a piece of land may validly establish under Article 594 of the Old Civil Code (or Article 688 of the New Civil Code), provided it does not contravene the law, public policy, or public order [6]. The limitation was validly imposed by the subdivision owner to assure purchasers that the peace and quiet of the residential section would not be disturbed by factories [4].

2. **NO.** The existence of a zoning ordinance is immaterial to the validity of the annotation. The Court reasoned that a zoning ordinance might be repealed or amended at any time, potentially converting the area into an industrial zone [7]. If the annotation were cancelled and the ordinance subsequently repealed, the prohibition would no longer be enforceable against new purchasers who might be ignorant of the original condition [7]. Thus, the contractual restriction provides independent protection.

The appealed order is **REVERSED**, and the petition to cancel the annotation is **DENIED** [8].
