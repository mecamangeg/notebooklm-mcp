I. CAPTION
PURAKAN PLANTATION COMPANY v. MELECIO R. DOMINGO, G.R. No. L-18571, October 29, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Purakan Plantation Company cultivated a cassava plantation in Lanao del Sur and manufactured cassava starch or flour [1]. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) assessed the petitioner deficiency sales taxes for the years 1950 to 1953, amounting to P22,393.52 [1, 2]. The Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue denied the petitioner’s request for reconsideration, finding that the petitioner bought cassava tubers from other plantation owners to manufacture into flour; thus, the production was not merely incidental to agriculture but a primary business not covered by the exemption under Section 188(b) of the Tax Code [2].

The petitioner appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). During trial, the petitioner’s manager denied buying tubers from others but failed to present company books or records to substantiate this claim [3]. The BIR presented an internal revenue agent who testified that he interviewed neighboring planters who confirmed selling tubers to the petitioner, submitting their affidavits as evidence [3, 4]. The petitioner argued these affidavits were hearsay [3]. The CTA sustained the assessment, ruling that the petitioner bought tubers from others and could not claim the exemption [3, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Tax Appeals erred in admitting the affidavits of neighboring planters as evidence against the petitioner.
2. W/N the petitioner is exempt from the payment of sales tax under Section 188(b) of the National Internal Revenue Code.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court of Tax Appeals is not governed strictly by technical rules of evidence. Section 8 of Republic Act No. 1125, the law creating the CTA, expressly provides for this liberality [6]. Consequently, the admission of the affidavits as part of the testimony of the investigating Internal Revenue agent was substantially in conformity with the law [4, 7].

2. **NO.** A person invoking an exemption from the payment of tax must justify their claim by a clear and positive grant of such privilege [8, 9]. The petitioner failed to present its books and records to prove it never bought cassava tubers from others, despite the requirement under Section 334 of the Revenue Code to keep records from which taxes may be accurately ascertained [3]. The failure to present such evidence implies it would be adverse if produced [3]. The preponderance of evidence supported the finding that the petitioner purchased raw materials from other planters, disqualifying it from the exemption [3].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [7].
