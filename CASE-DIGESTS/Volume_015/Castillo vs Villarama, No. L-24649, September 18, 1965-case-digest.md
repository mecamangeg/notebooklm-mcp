I. CAPTION
BIENVENIDO A. CASTILLO v. HON. JOSE M. VILLARAMA and ARSENIO SULIT, G.R. No. L-24649, September 18, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Governor Villarama filed an administrative complaint for oppression and maladministration against Petitioner Castillo, the Municipal Mayor of Pulilan, Bulacan, and ordered his suspension [1]. The Provincial Board scheduled the investigation, but the Governor and Vice-Governor were absent during the hearings [2, 3]. The three present Board members, constituting a quorum, proceeded with the investigation, acquitted Castillo, and ordered his reinstatement [4]. Governor Villarama refused to recognize the Board's decision, arguing that his presence was indispensable, and instructed Vice-Mayor Sulit not to relinquish the office [5]. Castillo filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction to enforce his reinstatement [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Provincial Governor may validly refuse to recognize the decision of the Provincial Board rendered in his absence by a quorum of its members.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Governor cannot validly refuse to recognize the decision. Under Section 5 of Republic Act No. 2264, while the Provincial Governor is the presiding officer of the Board, his presence is not indispensable for the valid transaction of business [6, 7]. The law considers the presence of three members sufficient to constitute a quorum, and explicitly states that in the absence of the Governor, "the vote of a majority of the members present shall constitute a binding act of the board" [6, 7]. The power to investigate administrative cases is lodged in the Provincial Board as a body, and the performance of this duty cannot be frustrated by the absence, whether fortuitous or deliberate, of the Governor [8]. Additionally, the Court noted that the thirty-day limit for preventive suspension had already expired, making the petitioner's reinstatement mandatory regardless of the investigation's status [9]. The petition is granted, and the preliminary injunction is made permanent [10].
