I. CAPTION
BOMBAY DEPARTMENT STORE v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-20460, September 30, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In 1954, Bombay Department Store (Petitioner) imported a case of merchandise declared to contain 124 dozens of nylon socks and 112 ½ dozens of nylon stockings. Upon examination by customs authorities, the shipment actually contained 289 dozens of nylon socks, 25 dozens of nylon stockings, and 29,715 rayon labels. Due to the discrepancy, where the importation exceeded the declared quantity by 115 dozens of socks and included undeclared labels, the goods were seized for violation of Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 in relation to the Revised Administrative Code. The goods were subsequently released to Petitioner upon the filing of a surety bond for the appraised value of P3,627.80.

The Collector of Customs ordered the forfeiture of the bond and payment of the amount. This was affirmed by the Commissioner of Customs and subsequently by the Court of Tax Appeals. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that there was no misdeclaration, that the Central Bank Circulars were repealed by Circular No. 133, and that the Commissioner lost jurisdiction due to the expiration of Republic Act No. 650.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 were repealed by Central Bank Circular No. 133.
2. W/N the expiration of Republic Act No. 650 deprived the Commissioner of Customs of jurisdiction over the forfeiture case.
3. W/N the merchandise is subject to forfeiture.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Central Bank Circular No. 133 did not repeal Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 by implication. The Court held that Circular No. 133, like Circular No. 44, requires a release certificate for imported goods, thereby reiterating the policy. Furthermore, Section 8 of Circular No. 133 expressly provides that all existing circulars not inconsistent with its provisions are "deemed incorporated hereto and made integral parts hereof by reference" [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The expiration of Republic Act No. 650 did not deprive the Commissioner of Customs of jurisdiction acquired prior to the expiration. The Court cited established jurisprudence holding that forfeiture proceedings are in the nature of proceedings *in rem*, and jurisdiction to act on pending cases is not lost upon the expiration of the statute [3, 4].

3. **YES.** Merchandise imported in violation of Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 acquires the status of "merchandise of prohibited importations" under Section 1363 (f) and (m) 3 and 4 of the Revised Administrative Code, rendering it subject to forfeiture [5, 6]. Additionally, the Court noted that fraud attaches to goods imported on a false invoice prepared by the consignor, justifying forfeiture even if the consignee claims innocence [6, 7].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
