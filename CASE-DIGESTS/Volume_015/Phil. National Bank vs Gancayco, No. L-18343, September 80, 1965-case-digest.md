I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK and EDUARDO Z. ROMUALDEZ v. EMILIO A. GANCAYCO and FLORENTINO FLOR, G.R. No. L-18343, September 30, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Special Prosecutors Gancayco and Flor required the Philippine National Bank (PNB) to produce the bank records of Ernesto T. Jimenez, the former administrator of the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Administration (ACCFA), who was under investigation for unexplained wealth [1, 2]. PNB President Eduardo Romualdez declined to reveal the records, invoking Section 2 of Republic Act No. 1405 (Bank Secrecy Law), which declares bank deposits absolutely confidential [2]. The prosecutors insisted on the production of records under Section 8 of Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) and threatened PNB officials with prosecution for contempt [3, 4]. PNB filed an action for declaratory judgment in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [5]. The CFI ruled in favor of the prosecutors, stating that R.A. 3019 intended to provide an additional ground for the examination of bank deposits [5]. PNB appealed, arguing that R.A. 3019 is a general law that could not have impliedly repealed the specific provisions of R.A. 1405 [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a bank can be compelled to disclose the records of accounts of a depositor who is under investigation for unexplained wealth. [1]

IV. RULING
**YES.** Section 8 of R.A. 3019 directs in mandatory terms that bank deposits "shall be taken into consideration in the enforcement of this section, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary" [4, 8]. The Court held that the only conclusion possible is that Section 8 of the Anti-Graft Law was intended to amend Section 2 of R.A. 1405 by providing an additional exception to the rule against the disclosure of bank deposits [8, 9]. The Court rejected PNB's argument against implied repeal, noting that the two laws are so repugnant to each other that no reconciliation is possible without subordinating the Anti-Graft Law to the Bank Secrecy Law [9]. Furthermore, the disclosure is not contrary to the policy of R.A. 1405, as cases of unexplained wealth are similar to cases of bribery or dereliction of duty, which are already enumerated exceptions to the confidentiality rule [10, 11]. This policy expresses the notion that a public office is a public trust [11].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED [12].
