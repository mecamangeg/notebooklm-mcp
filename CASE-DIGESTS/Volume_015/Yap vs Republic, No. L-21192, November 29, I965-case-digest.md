I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF JESUS YAP TO BE ADMITTED AS A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. JESUS YAP v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21192, November 29, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On January 30, 1960, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a decision granting the petition for naturalization of Jesus Yap [1]. On March 9, 1962, Yap moved to take his oath of allegiance, but the motion was denied after a hearing due to a finding of lack of good moral character [1, 2]. The lower court found that subsequent to the decision and prior to the hearing, Yap had lived with Ligaya Jose as his wife without the benefit of marriage since November 1960 [2]. Furthermore, in his 1960 income tax return, Yap declared Ligaya as his wife and claimed the P3,000 exemption for married persons, despite the fact that they were not married until January 7, 1961 [2]. Yap appealed, arguing that the statement in his tax return was not intended to deceive [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner possesses the good moral character required to take the oath of allegiance.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of the lower court [3, 4]. The Court held that regardless of the degree of immorality attached to the petitioner's extra-marital relations, his statement in his 1960 income tax return that he was married was not merely an innocent mistake but a "deliberate misrepresentation" [3]. This act may constitute perjury and a violation of the Internal Revenue Code, as he claimed the statutory exemption of P3,000.00 for married persons to which he was not entitled at the time [3]. Such conduct evinced a "serious flaw in his moral fiber," justifying the denial of his motion to take the oath of allegiance [3].
