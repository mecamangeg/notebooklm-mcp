I. CAPTION
THE COSMOPOLITAN INSURANCE CO., INC. v. ANGEL B. REYES, G.R. No. L-20199, November 23, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Cosmopolitan Insurance Co., Inc. filed a bond in favor of the Collector of Internal Revenue to secure the payment of P25,422.85 in income taxes owed by Angel B. Reyes. In consideration of the bond, Reyes signed an Indemnity Agreement. Paragraph 3 of the agreement stipulated that if Cosmopolitan became liable to the obligee, it could proceed against Reyes to enforce payment "even prior to making payment to the obligee."

Reyes defaulted on his tax obligations, causing Cosmopolitan to become liable for P10,645.38. Cosmopolitan filed a suit for indemnification against Reyes even though it had not yet paid the Collector of Internal Revenue. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Cosmopolitan, ordering Reyes to pay the amount due plus 15% attorney's fees. Reyes appealed, arguing that the stipulation allowing recovery before payment was contrary to public policy and Article 2071 of the Civil Code, which limits a guarantor's action to obtaining release or security.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the stipulation in the indemnity agreement allowing the surety to demand indemnification from the principal before paying the creditor is valid.
2. W/N the award of 15% attorney's fees is unreasonable.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The stipulation is valid and enforceable. The Supreme Court ruled that a contractual provision allowing a surety to recover from the indemnitor even before paying the creditor does not militate against the public good nor is it contrary to the policy of the law. The Court applied the doctrine laid down in *Security Bank vs. Globe Assurance* (58 Off. Gaz. 3708) and *Alto Surety and Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Aguilar* (G.R. No. L-5625), holding that under such specific terms, the liability of the principal becomes immediately demandable upon the occurrence of their default, regardless of whether the surety has actually paid the obligation.

2. **NO.** The award is not unreasonable. The Court held that the award of 15% attorney's fees was within reason, citing *Cruz vs. Court of Industrial Relations* (G.R. No. L-18277), where an award of 30% was sustained. The determination of attorney's fees rests on the sound discretion of the court.

The decision of the Court of First Instance is AFFIRMED.
