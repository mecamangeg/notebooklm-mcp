I. CAPTION
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MANUEL S. OZARRAGA, as Administrator of the Intestate Estate of LEON CUÑAT, G.R. No. L-16631, September 20, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
The Supreme Court previously affirmed the lower court's order dismissing the complaint of the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) against the Intestate Estate of Leon Cuñat on the ground of prescription. DBP filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing for the first time that the prescriptive period should be twenty (20) years under the Civil Code, not ten (10) years. DBP further contended that the debt moratorium suspended prescription until May 18, 1953 (the date *Rutter v. Esteban* was promulgated), rather than July 26, 1948 (enactment of R.A. No. 342). DBP claimed that the burden was on the defendant-appellee to prove the deceased was not a war damage claimant to avail of the shorter moratorium period, citing *Rio y Cia v. Datu Jolkipli*. However, the records showed that in DBP's opposition to the motion to dismiss and its memorandum in the lower court, it expressly stated and admitted that the moratorium lasted only up to July 26, 1948.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the applicable prescriptive period is twenty (20) years under the New Civil Code.
2. W/N DBP can claim the longer debt moratorium period ending in 1953 due to the defendant's lack of proof regarding war damage claims.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The applicable law is the Code of Civil Procedure (Act 190), specifically Sections 40 and 43, not the New Civil Code. Under Article 1116 of the New Civil Code, the prescriptive period already started before the Code's effectivity; thus, the laws in force at that time (Act 190) govern.

2. **NO.** DBP is **estopped** from asserting the absence of evidence regarding the deceased's war damage claim status. While the burden of proof generally lies with the party claiming the shorter moratorium period, DBP had already admitted in its pleadings before the trial court that the moratorium ended on July 26, 1948. Furthermore, DBP did not question the applicability of the shorter moratorium period in its brief on appeal and impliedly admitted that the deceased was not a war damage claimant. It cannot now change its position.

The Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED**.
