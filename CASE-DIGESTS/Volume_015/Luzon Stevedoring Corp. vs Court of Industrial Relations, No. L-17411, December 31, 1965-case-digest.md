I. CAPTION
LUZON STEVEDORING CORPORATION v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and LUSTEVECO EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION-CCLU; LUSTEVECO EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION-CCLU v. LUZON STEVEDORING CO., INC. (Consolidated), G.R. Nos. L-17411, L-18681 & L-18683, December 31, 1965, 15 SCRA 660, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Luzon Stevedoring Corporation (Luzon) and Lusteveco Employees Association (LEA) had a collective bargaining agreement. On December 22, 1958, Luzon suspended seven security guards, all LEA members, for various offenses including sleeping on post and insubordination, and filed a motion in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to convert these into permanent dismissals. Luzon also reduced the 1958 Christmas bonus from 15 days' pay to 10 days' pay due to reduced profits.

On January 2, 1959, LEA charged Luzon with unfair labor practice (ULP) for the dismissals and bonus reduction. That midnight, LEA declared a strike without filing a strike notice. The CIR declared the strike illegal for lack of notice and because the ULP charges were unfounded. The CIR authorized the dismissal of active unionists but ordered Luzon to either reinstate the other strikers without backwages or grant them severance pay. Luzon appealed, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction to order reinstatement after declaring the strike illegal. LEA also appealed the declaration of the strike's illegality.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the strike declared by LEA on January 2, 1959 was legal.
2. W/N the suspension of security guards and reduction of the Christmas bonus constituted Unfair Labor Practice.
3. W/N the CIR has the power to order reinstatement or severance pay for strikers despite finding the strike illegal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The strike was illegal because it was declared without prior notice to the Conciliation Service. Furthermore, the alleged causes—ULP charges—were not substantiated. The Court affirmed that the strike was unjustified as the labor dispute was already pending before the Court.

2. **NO.** The suspensions were for valid causes. Sleeping in post, gross insubordination, and challenging superiors to a fight are grave offenses inimical to the employer's interest, justifying dismissal as a measure of self-protection [1]. Regarding the bonus, it is an act of generosity and is not a demandable obligation unless made part of the wage or salary. The reduction was due to a decrease in profits for the year 1958 and applied to all employees uniformly, negating any claim of discrimination [2].

3. **YES.** Under Section 10 of Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act), when a labor dispute in an industry indispensable to the national interest is certified by the President to the CIR, the Court has broad powers of compulsory arbitration. This includes the authority to issue orders fixing the terms and conditions of employment. If the CIR can fix terms of employment, it "certainly can order the reinstatement of the workers or payment of severance pay as a term or condition of employment" to settle the dispute, even if the strike was illegal [3].

Petitions in L-18681 and L-18683 are DENIED and the CIR decision is AFFIRMED. Petition in L-17411 is DISMISSED for being moot.
