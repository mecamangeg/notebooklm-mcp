I. CAPTION
LA MALLORCA and PAMPANGA BUS COMPANY, INC. v. ARMANDO MERCADO, G.R. No. L-19120, November 29, 1965, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On October 27, 1960, respondent Armando Mercado filed an application with the Public Service Commission (PSC) to operate six jitneys on the Balanga-Orion line in Bataan. Petitioners La Mallorca and Pampanga Bus Company, Inc. opposed the application, arguing that their existing service was adequate and that the new service would cause ruinous competition [1, 2]. During the hearing, Mercado presented three witnesses testifying to the public necessity, while petitioners presented only one witness, a travelling inspector [2]. The PSC granted Mercado a certificate to operate four units, basing its decision on the applicant's evidence and an internal memorandum dated August 14, 1961, by PSC Inspector Gonzalo Frias, which reported numerous "colorum" operators in the area [3, 4]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the PSC abused its discretion by relying on the memorandum without placing Inspector Frias on the witness stand and by ignoring petitioners' evidence of service frequency [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission abused its discretion in granting the certificate of public convenience based partly on an internal inspector's report without the inspector's testimony.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Public Service Commission did not abuse its discretion. As a quasi-administrative and quasi-judicial body, the PSC is a fact-finding agency whose decisions are influenced not only by evidence presented in hearings but also by reports from field agents and inspectors that form part of its records [7, 8]. The Supreme Court held that the memorandum by Inspector Frias was a routine periodic report not specifically made for this case, and the PSC validly considered it as persuasive evidence corroborating the applicant's proofs [8]. Since the Commission's conclusion of fact regarding the urgent need for service was supported by substantial evidence—both from the witnesses and its own records—the Court will not interfere (*Pangasinan Transportation Co. vs. De la Cruz*) [7-9].

The decision of the Public Service Commission is affirmed [10].
