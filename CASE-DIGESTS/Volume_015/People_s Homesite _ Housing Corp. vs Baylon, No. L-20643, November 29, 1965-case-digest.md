I. CAPTION
PEOPLE'S HOMESITE & HOUSING CORPORATION v. MARCIANO BAYLON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20643, November 29, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondents, tenants of the Gonzales estate, filed an action to compel petitioner People's Homesite & Housing Corp. (PHHC) to sell them the lots they occupied. PHHC argued that its duty was to sell to bona fide tenants, and that some respondents had lost their preferential rights by assigning their interests to the intervenor, Araneta Institute of Agriculture [1]. The trial court allowed Araneta Institute to intervene over PHHC's objection [2].

Subsequently, the parties entered into a compromise agreement wherein PHHC recognized the priority rights of the plaintiffs to purchase the lots at P3.80 per square meter, subject to survey reservations for public use [2, 3]. In December 1961, the trial court rendered judgment based on this compromise [3]. When plaintiffs moved for execution in 1962, PHHC objected, alleging inter alia that the survey was incomplete and reiterating that the tenants who sold rights to Araneta had forfeited their privileges [3, 4]. The trial court issued the order of execution, prompting PHHC to file this petition alleging abuse of discretion [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the execution of the judgment based on the compromise agreement despite PHHC's objections regarding the intervenor.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that it was "too late to insist" on the issue regarding the tenants' assignment of rights to the Araneta Institute. The Court noted that PHHC's objection to the intervention had been overruled by the lower court and was not appealed [6]. Furthermore, in the compromise agreement, PHHC explicitly undertook to convey the lots to the plaintiffs "without excluding those who had sold to Araneta Institute" [6]. Having bound itself to this agreement, upon which the judgment was based, PHHC cannot prevent execution on grounds it had already waived or failed to appeal.

The petition was dismissed, and the preliminary injunction dissolved [7].
