I. CAPTION
COTO LABOR UNION (NLU), petitioner, vs. JOSE C. ESPINAS and EULOGIO R. LERUM, respondents., G.R. No. L-21152, September 20, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Coto Labor Union (NLU) engaged Atty. Jose Espinas to handle cases against Benguet Consolidated Mining Company before the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). The contracts stipulated a contingent fee of 20% to 25% of any amount recovered by the Union, whether by "action or settlement." Atty. Eulogio Lerum was also engaged to assist Atty. Espinas. After Espinas rendered services for over six years, including handling appeals to the Supreme Court, the Union and the mining company settled the cases amicably for P300,000.00 without the intervention of the counsel. Espinas and Lerum filed a petition with the CIR to collect attorney’s fees of 15% and 10% of the settlement amount, respectively. The Union objected, arguing that Espinas's fee was excessive given the amicable settlement and that it had no contractual relationship with Lerum, alleging he was hired by Espinas personally. The CIR awarded the fees as requested.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Atty. Espinas is entitled to the 15% attorney’s fees despite the amicable settlement.
2. W/N the Union is liable for the 10% attorney's fees of Atty. Lerum.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the award to Atty. Espinas. The written contract explicitly stipulated compensation of 25% of any amount due the Union "whether by action or settlement." The Court held that the CIR was in the best position to assess the value of the services, noting that Espinas served for over six years on a contingent basis. The fact that the case was settled amicably did not invalidate the agreed fees, especially since the stipulated rate was higher than the 15% awarded.

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that Atty. Lerum was entitled to separate compensation. Evidence showed that the Union President hired Lerum to assist Espinas, and Lerum appeared as counsel in pleadings and hearings before the CIR and Supreme Court without objection from the Union. His appearance was separate and distinct from that of Atty. Espinas.

The order and resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations were affirmed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., and Zaldivar concurred. Chief Justice Bengzon and Justices Bautista Angelo and Barrera were on leave.
