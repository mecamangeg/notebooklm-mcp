I. CAPTION
LUIS ATIENZA BIJIS, TRINIDAD REYNOSO, SIMPLICIO CAPISTRANO, and ROBERTO QUEJANO v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS, CATALINO PALERNO and SIMEONA PALERNO, G.R. No. L-18944, October 29, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Teodora Reynoso, the predecessor-in-interest of private respondents, originally owned the subject land. In 1939, she conveyed it to Esperanza Quejano via a contract purporting to be a sale with *pacto de retro*, but she later filed Civil Case No. 4953 claiming it was an equitable mortgage. A notice of *lis pendens* regarding this case was annotated on the title. The trial court eventually rendered a final judgment declaring the contract an equitable mortgage and ordering the reconveyance of the property to Teodora.

During the pendency of the litigation, the property was mortgaged, foreclosed, and eventually sold to petitioners Spouses Luis Atienza Bijis and Trinidad Reynoso. The title issued to petitioners (TCT No. T-17237) carried the annotation of the notice of *lis pendens*. Although a deed of reconveyance was executed pursuant to the final judgment in the civil case, a new title could not be issued to respondents because the owner's duplicate was held in a separate proceeding. Respondents filed a motion in the original Cadastral Case (No. 10) to compel petitioners to surrender their title for cancellation and for the issuance of a new one. The lower court granted the motion, which the Court of Appeals affirmed. Petitioners argued that the lower court, acting as a cadastral court with limited jurisdiction, lacked authority to grant the relief.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court, acting as a court of land registration, had jurisdiction to order the surrender and cancellation of the petitioners' title to implement a final judgment in a separate civil case.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the lower court had jurisdiction. Under **Section 112 of Act 496** (Land Registration Act), the court, acting as a court of land registration, has the authority to consider such a motion and grant the relief prayed for. The Court reasoned that the motion was for the exclusive purpose of implementing the final judgment in Civil Case No. 4953, which directed the reconveyance of the property. Since the petitioners purchased the land and accepted the title subject to the notice of *lis pendens* connected to that civil case, they were bound to accept the outcome of that litigation. Consequently, the surrender of their title and the issuance of a new one to the prevailing party were proper. The order appealed from is affirmed.
