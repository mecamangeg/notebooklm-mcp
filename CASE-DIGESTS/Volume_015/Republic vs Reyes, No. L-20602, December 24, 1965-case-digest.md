I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. ANDRES REYES, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, BENITO MACROHON, and TAN CHIONG, G.R. No. L-20602, December 24, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Tan Chiong, a citizen of Nationalist China who allegedly arrived in the Philippines in 1924, filed a petition for naturalization. He claimed exemption from filing a Declaration of Intention based on continuous residence for over 30 years. On September 30, 1960, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, presided by respondent Judge Reyes, granted the petition. The Solicitor General initially appealed but withdrew it. However, on October 29, 1962, before Tan Chiong could take his oath, the Solicitor General filed a motion to vacate the decision and opposed the oath-taking, citing Tan Chiong’s failure to state previous places of residence, failure to educate all children in Philippine schools, use of an unauthorized alias, and lack of credible character witnesses. The CFI denied the motion. The Republic filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court. Tan Chiong questioned the remedy, arguing that appeal was the proper recourse and that the Republic failed to file a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) in the lower court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N certiorari is a proper remedy despite the lack of a Motion for Reconsideration and the availability of appeal.
2. W/N the applicant Tan Chiong is qualified for naturalization.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that while appeal is generally the appropriate remedy, naturalization proceedings are so infused with public interest that they are treated differently. The granting of a petition does not preclude reopening the case, nor does it constitute *res judicata* against the State. Furthermore, the petitioner's failure to file an MR was excused by the urgency of preventing the enforcement of the CFI's order, which could have been used to stall the deportation of the applicant's overstaying children. Since the matters raised involved facts already in the decision and pleadings, certiorari was considered adequate.

2. **NO.** Tan Chiong failed to meet the statutory requirements:
    *   **Exemption from Declaration of Intention:** To avail of the exemption based on 30 years of residence, the applicant must show that *all* his children of school age received primary and secondary education in government-recognized Philippine schools (Sec. 6, Revised Naturalization Law). Tan Chiong failed to do this; four of his children never came to the Philippines, and two only arrived in 1960. Financial difficulty and strict immigration laws are not valid excuses for non-compliance (*Chan Lai v. Republic*).
    *   **Statement of Residence:** He failed to state his places of residence from 1924 to 1947 in his petition, mentioning only his San Juan residence. This omission is fatal (*Uytengsu v. Republic*).
    *   **Alias:** He used the name "Sotero Tan Chiong" in official documents, but the published petition only named "Tan Chiong." Failure to disclose an alias in the publication warrants denial (*Yu Seco v. Republic*).
    *   **Character Witnesses:** Since Tan Chiong invoked 30 years of residence, his witnesses must have known him for that same period to serve as "insurers" of his conduct. His witnesses only knew him since 1947, making them not "credible witnesses" within the contemplation of the law.

The decision and order of the lower court are **SET ASIDE**, and the petition for naturalization is **DISMISSED**.
