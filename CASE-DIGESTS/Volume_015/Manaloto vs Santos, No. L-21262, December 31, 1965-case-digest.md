I. CAPTION
ALEJANDRO MANALOTO v. MIGUEL P. SANTOS, KAPISANANG "ANG BUHAY," INC., LAND TENURE ADMINISTRATION and HON. GREGORIO N. GARCIA, G.R. No. L-21262, December 31, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Manaloto and respondent Santos both applied to purchase Lot No. 7, Block 2 of the Tuason Estate, which had been acquired by the government. On January 13, 1955, the Director of Lands adjudicated the sale in favor of Santos. Manaloto filed a motion for reconsideration on April 6, 1955, which was denied on July 17, 1956 by the Land Tenure Administration (LTA), the agency that succeeded the Division of Landed Estates.

On October 9, 1956—eighty-four days after the first denial—Manaloto filed a second motion for reconsideration, which was denied on November 20, 1956. Eight months later, Manaloto filed a petition for mandamus and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to cancel the deed of sale issued to Santos. The CFI dismissed the petition for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, noting Manaloto failed to appeal to the Office of the President. Manaloto appealed, arguing that under *Baladhay v. Castrillo*, the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply because the land is not part of the public domain under the Public Land Law (Commonwealth Act No. 141).

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition is barred by the petitioner's failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the decision of the Land Tenure Administration had become final and executory.

Under Sections 2 and 3 of Administrative Order No. 1 (issued January 12, 1956), promulgated by the LTA pursuant to Section 6 of Republic Act No. 1400, a decision of the LTA Chairman becomes final unless appealed to the Office of the President within 30 days from receipt of notice. While a motion for reconsideration interrupts this period, Manaloto allowed the reglementary period to lapse before filing his second motion for reconsideration and failed to perfect an appeal to the Office of the President. Consequently, the administrative decision became final and is no longer subject to judicial review.

The Court rejected Manaloto's reliance on *Baladhay v. Castrillo*. That case involved a free patent under the Public Land Law (C.A. No. 141) regarding land that was not part of the public domain. In contrast, the subject lot in this case admittedly belongs to the State, and the LTA acted under Republic Act No. 1400, not C.A. No. 141. Thus, the specific administrative remedies provided by the LTA regulations were applicable and mandatory.

**Decision affirmed.**
