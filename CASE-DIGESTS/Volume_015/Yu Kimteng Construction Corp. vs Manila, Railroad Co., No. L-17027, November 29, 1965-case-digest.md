**I. CAPTION**
YU KIMTENG CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and MANILA PORT SERVICE, G.R. No. L-17027, November 29, 1965, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiff Yu Kimteng Construction Corporation imported reinforced steel bars from New York, which were unloaded in Manila on May 31, 1957, and placed in the custody of defendant Manila Port Service, a subsidiary of Manila Railroad Company. On June 20, 1957, plaintiff obtained delivery of only three out of eight lifts of steel bars; five were missing. On the same day, plaintiff filed provisional claims for the shortage. Defendants denied liability, arguing that under Section 15 of the Management Contract, claims must be filed within 15 days from the date of discharge of the last package from the vessel. Since the discharge was on May 31 and the claim was filed on June 20, defendants argued it was time-barred. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, upholding that the claim was filed beyond the 15-day period.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the 15-day period for filing a claim under the Management Contract commences from the date of discharge of the goods from the vessel.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the 15-day period provided in the Management Contract commences not from the date of discharge, but from the date the consignee or claimant learns of the loss, damage, or misdelivery. The Court reasoned that a consignee is in no position to allege loss before obtaining knowledge of it, especially while goods are in the care of the arrastre contractor. To rule otherwise would allow the contractor to escape liability simply by withholding knowledge of the loss until the period expires. The Court cited *Republic of the Phil. v. Manila Port Service* and *Chiok Ho v. Compañia Maritima* to support this doctrine. Since the plaintiff learned of the loss and filed a claim on June 20, 1957, the claim was timely.

The judgment appealed from is **REVERSED**, and defendants-appellees are ordered to pay plaintiff-appellant P7,955.00 as compensatory damages and P1,000.00 as attorney's fees.
