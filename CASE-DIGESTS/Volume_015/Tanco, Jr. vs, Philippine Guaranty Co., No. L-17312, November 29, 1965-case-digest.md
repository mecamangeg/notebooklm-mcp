I. CAPTION
**ARTURO R. TANCO, JR. v. THE PHILIPPINE GUARANTY COMPANY**, G.R. No. L-17312, November 29, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On September 1, 1959, the automobile of Arturo Tanco, Jr. (Petitioner) figured in a collision with a delivery van while being driven by his brother, Manuel Tanco. Petitioner paid P2,536.99 for repairs and filed a claim with Philippine Guaranty Company (Respondent) under his insurance policy [1]. The Respondent rejected the claim because at the time of the accident, Manuel’s driver’s license was invalid; his 1958 license had expired and was not renewed for 1959. Manuel only renewed his license on September 8, 1959, one week after the accident [2, 3].

Petitioner sued in the Municipal Court of Manila, which was elevated to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI ruled in favor of Petitioner, stating that the ambiguity in the policy's "Authorized Driver" definition should be construed against the insurer, noting that Manuel was not "disqualified by order of a court" from driving. Respondent appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law [1, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the insurer is liable for the damage sustained when the vehicle was driven by a person holding an expired driver’s license.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision.

The Court held that the "Authorized Driver" clause in the insurance policy is clear and unambiguous. The policy limits liability to accidents occurring while the vehicle is driven by the Insured or any person driving with his permission, "provided that the person driving is permitted in accordance with the licensing or other laws or regulations to drive the Motor Vehicle" [3, 4].

Under the Motor Vehicle Law (Act No. 3992), a license that is not renewed for the current year becomes delinquent and invalid. Since Manuel Tanco did not have a valid license at the time of the accident, he was not an "Authorized Driver" under the terms of the policy. The Court ruled that renewing the license one week after the accident did not cure the delinquency or revalidate the license for the date of the collision [2, 3]. The exclusion clause is valid and binding, as it does not refer to general violations of law but to a specific risk exclusion regarding unauthorized drivers [5].

Judgment reversed.
