I. CAPTION
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, petitioner, vs. LADISLAO MANALANG and THE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, respondents., G.R. No. L-20845, November 29, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Ladislao Manalang worked for the Manila Railroad Company (MRR) from 1926 to 1954, serving lastly as a locomotive fireman [1]. His duties involved maintaining the engine and feeding it with coal or wood, exposing him to extreme heat and sudden temperature changes [1, 2]. In 1950, he vomited blood and was diagnosed with a lung spot; he suffered another episode in 1953 [3]. He retired due to disability on March 1, 1954 [3]. On November 10, 1958, Manalang filed a claim for compensation with the Department of Labor Regional Office [4]. MRR contested the claim, arguing prescription as it was filed beyond the two-month period under Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act [5]. The Regional Office awarded compensation, which the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed, adding attorney's fees [4]. MRR appealed, questioning the Regional Office's jurisdiction, the timeliness of the claim, the compensability of the illness, and the award of attorney's fees [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Regional Office of the Department of Labor has jurisdiction over the claim.
2. W/N the claim is barred by prescription for being filed beyond the statutory period.
3. W/N the illness (PTB) is compensable.
4. W/N attorney's fees are recoverable against the employer.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The regional offices of the Department of Labor are vested with jurisdiction to hear and decide claims for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act [6]. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Miller v. Mardo*.

2. **NO.** While the claim was filed late under Section 24, MRR failed to file a timely controversion under Section 45 of the Act [5]. Failure to controvert constitutes a renunciation of the right to challenge the claim and bars all defenses, including the defense based on the employee's failure to file the claim in due time (*National Development Corporation v. Workmen's Compensation Commission*) [7, 8].

3. **YES.** The WCC's findings that the illness arose out of or was aggravated by employment are supported by substantial evidence and are thus binding on the Supreme Court [9]. Manalang's exposure to heat and physical strain lowered his resistance, allowing tuberculosis to develop [10].

4. **YES.** Although the Workmen's Compensation Act does not specifically govern attorney's fees recoverable from the adverse party, Article 2208(8) of the New Civil Code applies supplementarily to cover this deficiency (*National Development Corporation v. WCC*) [9, 11].

The decision and resolution appealed from are affirmed [12].
