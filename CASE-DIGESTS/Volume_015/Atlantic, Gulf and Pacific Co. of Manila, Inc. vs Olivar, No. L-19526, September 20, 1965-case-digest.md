I. CAPTION
ATLANTIC, GULF AND PACIFIC COMPANY OF MANILA, INC. v. HILARION OLIVAR and HON. JOSE S. BAUTISTA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19526, September 20, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In June 1961, respondent Hilarion Olivar filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against petitioner Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Co., alleging that the company had dismissed him as a watchman without cause. Olivar prayed for reinstatement, back wages, moral damages of P1,000.00, and attorney's fees [1], [2]. The petitioner filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the CIR lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter. The CIR overruled the motion and denied the subsequent motion for reconsideration [1]. Consequently, the petitioner filed a special civil action for certiorari with the Supreme Court challenging the CIR's authority to take cognizance of the case [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over a complaint for reinstatement and back wages that does not allege an unfair labor practice or a specific labor dispute.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has no jurisdiction over the case. Olivar's complaint merely alleged dismissal without cause and sought reinstatement, back wages, and damages [3]. There was no allegation of a labor dispute, unfair labor practice (ULP), or a fixed term of employment [3]. Furthermore, the claim did not involve the Eight-Hour Labor Law or the Minimum Wage Law [3].

The Court applied the doctrine that a prayer for reinstatement and back wages, standing alone, does not bring a case within the CIR's jurisdiction [4]. Absent an allegation of ULP or a certification by the President, such a case is a "mere money claim" that falls under the jurisdiction of the regular courts [3]. At most, recovery could be had under Republic Act No. 1052 (Termination Pay Law), as amended [3]. The Court relied on *Campos v. Manila Railroad Company* and *San Miguel Brewery, Inc. v. Floresca* to support the principle that without ULP, the CIR lacks the power to grant remedies like reinstatement or back wages under its general powers of mediation and conciliation [3], [4].

The writ is GRANTED and the order of the Court of Industrial Relations is REVERSED [5].
