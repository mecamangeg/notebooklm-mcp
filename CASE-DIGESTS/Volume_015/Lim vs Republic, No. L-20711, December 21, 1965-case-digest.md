I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. SERAPION LIM v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-20711, December 21, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Serapion Lim, a Chinese citizen residing in Ozamiz City since 1936, filed a petition for naturalization on May 6, 1961. He is married and has two children. He works as a salesman for Chua Seng Corn Mill with a monthly salary of P300.00. During the trial, he presented two character witnesses, Maximo Lago and Jose Nuñez. While these witnesses testified as to Lim's residence and good moral character, they failed to testify that he possessed *each* of the requisite qualifications, such as language proficiency or freedom from mental alienation and incurable diseases [1-3]. The Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental granted the petition on October 4, 1962. The Republic appealed, questioning the sufficiency of the character witnesses and the lucrative nature of Lim's income [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the testimony of the character witnesses was sufficient to support the petition.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the deficiency in the witnesses' testimony is fatal. Character witnesses must attest in court that the petitioner possesses *each* of the requisite qualifications. In this case, the witnesses only specified some qualifications and merely stated in general terms that Lim possessed all qualifications and none of the disqualifications. They failed to specifically establish facts such as Lim's ability to speak and write the principal Philippine languages or that he was free from contagious diseases [2-4]. The Court relied on the ruling in *Cuaki Tan Si vs. Republic* [4].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that Lim's income is not lucrative. As a salesman earning P300.00 a month (P3,600.00 per annum), while being married with two children, his income is insufficient. The Court cited *Tan v. Republic*, where an annual income of P6,300.00 was held not lucrative for a married applicant with one child [4].

The judgment appealed from is reversed and the petition for naturalization is denied [5].
