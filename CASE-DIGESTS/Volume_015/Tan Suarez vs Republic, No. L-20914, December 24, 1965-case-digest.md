I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MINOR, ENGRACIO GULIGADO, JR., MRS. DINTOY TAN SUAREZ v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20914, December 24, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Dintoy Tan Suarez filed a petition to adopt her minor nephew, Engracio Guligado, Jr., whom she had raised since infancy. Her husband, Col. Alejandro Suarez, did not join the petition because he had children from a previous marriage, although he consented to the adoption [1]. To prove the natural parents' consent, Petitioner submitted a statement subscribed and sworn to before a notary public but did not introduce testimonial evidence to identify the signatures [2]. The Court of First Instance of Sulu granted the petition and authorized the minor to bear the name "Engracio Tan Suarez" [3]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that the written consent was inadmissible without testimonial identification and that the minor should not bear the surname of Petitioner’s husband who did not join the adoption [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the written consent of the natural parents was admissible in evidence despite the lack of testimonial identification.
2. W/N the adopted child may bear the surname of the adopter as a married woman (including her husband's surname) when the husband did not join in the adoption.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The statement of consent was correctly admitted in evidence. The document was subscribed and sworn to before a notary public, making it duly authenticated. The Court held that even without testimonial evidence identifying the signatures, the notarization and other evidence on record strongly indicated that the document was genuine and what it purported to be [4], [5], [6].

2. **NO.** An adopted child cannot bear the surname of the adopter as a married woman where the husband has not joined the petition for adoption. The Court held that allowing the minor to use the husband's surname would mislead the public into believing the husband had also adopted the child, which was not the case. Furthermore, it could cause confusion regarding successional rights, as the husband's consent might be mistaken for joinder in the adoption [7], [8], [9]. Citing the Civil Code and prior jurisprudence (*In re Adoption of the Minor Ana Isabel Henriette Antonia Concepcion Georgiana*), the Court ruled that the child must use the surname of the adopter herself, not the one acquired by marriage [9], [10].

The decision was **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION** that the minor shall hereafter be known as Engracio Tan [10].
