I. CAPTION
SENICIO DY ONG alias SENECIO DY GO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21017, November 29, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Senicio Dy Ong filed a petition for naturalization on May 6, 1960. He claimed to have an annual income of P1,800.00 derived from his employment as a purchasing agent in Manila for "Ong Sing Trading," a business establishment in Goa, Camarines Sur owned by his father. He allegedly began this employment in April 1960 at a monthly salary of P150.00 while he was studying in Manila. The Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur granted the petition. The Republic, through the Solicitor General, appealed on the ground that the petitioner lacked a lucrative trade, profession, or occupation. The petitioner later presented testimony regarding salary increases and commissions earned in 1961 and 1962 to bolster his claim.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner satisfied the lucrative trade, profession, or occupation requirement for naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that an annual income of P1,800.00 is clearly insufficient to characterize a trade or occupation as lucrative [1, 2]. At the time the petition was filed on May 6, 1960, the petitioner had earned less than P300.00, and his total income for the year was only P1,350.00, or roughly P112.50 a month [1, 3]. Furthermore, considering the petitioner was a student in Manila claiming employment in his father's provincial business, the Court found that such evidence "smacks merely of an attempt to meet conveniently the statutory requirement" rather than proving a bona fide occupation [3, 4]. The Court also ruled that evidence of increased income in years subsequent to the filing (1961 and 1962) did not offset the fact that he lacked the requisite qualifications *at the time* of the petition's presentation [5, 6].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED** [6].
