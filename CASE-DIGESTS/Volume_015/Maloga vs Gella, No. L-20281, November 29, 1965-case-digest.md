I. CAPTION
DOMINGO MALOGA v. VICENTE G. GELLA, DALMACIO C. GENER and MELITON REYES, G.R. No. L-20281, November 29, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Domingo Maloga, the National Cashier of the Bureau of Treasury, was required by respondent Treasurer of the Philippines Vicente G. Gella to explain alleged violations of office regulations and neglect of duty. Unsatisfied with Maloga's explanation, Gella filed an unverified letter-complaint charging him with grave misconduct and relieving him of his position [1]. Maloga argued the complaint was null and void because it was not sworn to, citing Section 32 of Republic Act No. 2260 [2]. Gella proceeded with the investigation, relying on Executive Order No. 370, claiming a department head is exempt from verifying complaints against subordinates [2, 3]. Instead of appealing to the Department Head, Maloga filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court to annul the complaint and enjoin the hearing officers [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies.
2. W/N the administrative complaint filed by the head of office requires verification.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies. From the order of the Treasurer relieving him of his position and authorizing the investigation, Maloga should have appealed to the corresponding Department Head before filing the action for certiorari [3, 5]. The failure to do so is fatal to the petition [6].

2. **NO.** A complaint filed by the head of a bureau or office need not be verified. Under Executive Order No. 370 (series of 1941), administrative proceedings may be commenced *motu proprio* by the head of the office, in which case the written charge need not be sworn to, as the head is deemed to be acting in his official capacity and under his oath of office [6]. The requirement in Section 32 of Republic Act No. 2260 for a sworn complaint applies only when the charge is filed by another person [6]. The Court also reiterated that a formal complaint is not a prerequisite to an administrative investigation [7].

The petition for certiorari is denied [8].
