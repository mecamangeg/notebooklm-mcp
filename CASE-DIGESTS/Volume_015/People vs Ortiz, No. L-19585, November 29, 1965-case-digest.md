I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. NAPOLEON C. ORTIZ, G.R. No. L-19585, November 29, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant-appellant Napoleon C. Ortiz was charged with Murder and Frustrated Murder. Upon arraignment, he pleaded not guilty. Trial ensued, and the prosecution presented two witnesses. Subsequently, Ortiz manifested his willingness to plead guilty to the lesser offenses of Homicide and Frustrated Homicide. With the court's approval, the Fiscal amended the information to reflect these lesser charges. Upon arraignment on the amended information, Ortiz pleaded guilty. He also presented the Chief of Police to prove the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.

The trial court convicted Ortiz but refused to appreciate the mitigating circumstance of a plea of guilty, ruling that the plea was made after the prosecution had already commenced the presentation of its evidence. Ortiz appealed, arguing he was entitled to said mitigating circumstance.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the mitigating circumstance of a plea of guilty should be appreciated when entered into an amended information after the prosecution had already presented evidence on the original information.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that although the trial had already begun on the original information for Murder, the amended information for Homicide and Frustrated Homicide constituted "an entirely new information." Crucially, no evidence had been presented in connection with the specific charges in the amended information at the time the appellant entered his plea of guilty [1].

Relying on the doctrine in *People v. Intal* (G.R. No. L-10585), the Court ruled that the appellant was entitled to have the mitigating circumstance of a plea of guilty considered in his favor [1, 2].

The judgment is **MODIFIED**, and the penalty is reduced to reflect the additional mitigating circumstance.
