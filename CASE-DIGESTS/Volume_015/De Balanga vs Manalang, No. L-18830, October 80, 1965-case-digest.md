I. CAPTION
TEOPISTA B. DE BALANGA, for herself and in behalf, as guardian ad litem, of her minor children, Nelson Balanga and Rey Balanga v. LUIS MANALANG, G.R. No. L-18830, October 30, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Teopista de Balanga and her husband Faustino bought a residential lot and built a house in Manila using common funds. Faustino died intestate, leaving Teopista and their two minor children as heirs. Subsequently, the spouses Clemente, represented by their counsel Luis Manalang (respondent), filed a collection suit against Teopista alone to compel a mortgage execution. Judgment was rendered against Teopista.

Pursuant to a writ of execution, the Sheriff levied upon and sold the *entire* house and lot to the Clementes, despite the minors' undivided one-half interest. Before the one-year redemption period expired, Manalang caused his clients to assign the property to him and subsequently ousted Teopista and her children. Teopista filed a complaint to annul the execution sale and the transfer to Manalang, alleging the sale of the minors' share was void and Manalang’s acquisition violated the prohibition against lawyers purchasing property in litigation. Manalang moved to dismiss for lack of capacity and cause of action. The lower court dismissed the case on the grounds that Manalang was not a necessary party, the issue was *res judicata*, and venue was improper.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the complaint states a cause of action against the respondent.
2. W/N the lower court properly dismissed the complaint on the grounds of *res judicata* and improper venue.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the facts alleged in the complaint constitute a cause of action for the annulment of the execution sale, at least insofar as it concerned the one-half share of the properties belonging to the minor children who were not parties to the collection suit. However, the Court noted that the action should have been directed not only against Manalang but also against the judgment creditors (the Clementes) and the Sheriff.
2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the pleas of *res judicata* and improper venue were improperly considered by the lower court because they were not raised in the respondent's motion to dismiss. A court cannot dismiss a case on grounds not relied upon by the movant in their motion to dismiss.

**ACCORDINGLY**, the order of dismissal is set aside and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.
