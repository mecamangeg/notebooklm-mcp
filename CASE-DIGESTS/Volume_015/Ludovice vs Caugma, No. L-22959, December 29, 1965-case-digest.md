I. CAPTION
PEDRO LUDOVICE v. MARCOS T. CAUGMA, THE HON. COMMISSIONER OF THE BUDGET and THE HON. COMMISSIONER OF CIVIL SERVICE, G.R. No. L-22959, December 29, 1965, Concepcion, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ludovice and respondent Caugma were both lawyers holding the position of Senior Legislative Analyst in the Budget Commission, having been appointed on the same date, July 1, 1961 [2]. When the position of Assistant Chief Legislative Analyst became vacant on August 16, 1961, both applied for the promotion [2, 3]. A committee created by the Budget Commissioner to study the candidates recommended Caugma [3]. The committee found that while both were of the same rank and eligibility, Caugma was more competent [3]. Consequently, Caugma was appointed, and his appointment was approved by the Civil Service Commissioner [4]. Ludovice filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to oust Caugma and compel his own appointment, claiming he had a better right as the ranking senior analyst [4, 5]. The CFI dismissed the case, and Ludovice appealed [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Ludovice has a better right to the promotion than Caugma. [5]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that Ludovice had no cause of action against the respondents [6]. The Court affirmed the principle that competence should be given priority consideration in promotions [3, 7]. It upheld the findings that Caugma was the superior candidate because: (1) he had served in the Budget Commission for over ten years longer than Ludovice; (2) he possessed an additional degree as a Commerce graduate; and (3) he held a higher efficiency rating of 81.5% compared to Ludovice's 73.5% [5]. The decision of the lower court dismissing the petition was affirmed [6].
