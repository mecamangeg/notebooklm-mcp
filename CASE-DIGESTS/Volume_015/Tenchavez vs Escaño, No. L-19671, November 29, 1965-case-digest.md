I. CAPTION
PASTOR B. TENCHAVEZ v. VICENTA F. ESCAÑO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19671, November 29, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On February 24, 1948, Pastor Tenchavez and Vicenta Escaño, both Filipino citizens, secretly married before a Catholic chaplain in Cebu. Upon discovery, Vicenta's parents were dismayed. A recelebration was planned but did not materialize after Vicenta allegedly received a letter regarding Pastor's affair. The couple became estranged. In 1950, Vicenta went to the United States and obtained a decree of absolute divorce in Nevada on the ground of "extreme cruelty." In 1954, she married an American, Russell Leo Moran, in Nevada, and acquired American citizenship in 1958.

Tenchavez filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu for legal separation and damages against Vicenta and her parents, alleging the latter alienated his wife's affections. The CFI denied the legal separation but freed Tenchavez from supporting Vicenta. It also dismissed the claim against the parents and instead awarded them damages on their counterclaim against Tenchavez.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the foreign divorce decree obtained by the wife validly dissolved the marriage.
2. W/N the plaintiff husband is entitled to a decree of legal separation.
3. W/N the wife's parents are liable for damages for alienation of affections.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A foreign divorce between Filipino citizens, sought and decreed after the effectivity of the New Civil Code (Republic Act No. 386), is not entitled to recognition as valid in the Philippines. Under Article 15 of the Civil Code, laws relating to family rights and duties, or to the status, condition, and legal capacity of persons are binding upon citizens of the Philippines, even though living abroad. At the time the divorce was issued in 1950, Vicenta was still a Filipino citizen. Furthermore, Article 17, Paragraph 3 of the Civil Code provides that prohibitive laws concerning persons, public order, and policy shall not be rendered ineffective by foreign judgments. Philippine law does not admit absolute divorce, only legal separation; recognizing the foreign decree would violate declared public policy.

2. **YES.** Since the foreign divorce is invalid, the marriage between Tenchavez and Vicenta remains subsisting. Vicenta's subsequent marriage to Moran and cohabitation with him is technically "intercourse with a person not her husband" from the standpoint of Philippine law. This constitutes adultery under Article 333 of the Revised Penal Code, which entitles the innocent spouse to a decree of legal separation [1]. Vicenta was ordered to pay P25,000 in moral damages for her desertion and securing of an invalid divorce.

3. **NO.** An action for alienation of affections against the parents of one consort does not lie in the absence of proof of malice or unworthy motives. The Court found that Vicenta's parents acted in good faith, motivated by their concern for their daughter's welfare, and did not actively induce her to leave her husband [2]. However, Tenchavez was ordered to pay reduced damages of P5,000 to the parents for filing an unfounded suit that caused them anxiety.

The decision was **MODIFIED**; Tenchavez was granted legal separation and P25,000 in damages from Vicenta, while Tenchavez was ordered to pay P5,000 in damages to the parents.
