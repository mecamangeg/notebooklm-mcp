**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ASTERIO VALERA, G.R. No. L-20286, October 29, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
On April 13, 1960, at around 11:00 A.M., Bernardino Sumalnap and his companions were standing near a rice mill at the public market of Bangued, Abra. They were approached by teenagers Domingo Bodaño and Zacarias Molina, who left shortly but returned with the accused, Asterio Valera [1, 2]. Valera suddenly stabbed Sumalnap several times in the chest. Sumalnap attempted to pursue Valera but fell; he was brought to a hospital where he died from shock due to hemorrhage [2, 3].

Valera, Bodaño, and Molina were charged with attempted robbery with murder [1]. The trial court quashed the charges against Bodaño and Molina for insufficient evidence but proceeded against Valera [1]. Valera interposed the defense of alibi, claiming that at noon on the day of the crime, he was in Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, where he was apprehended by a policeman for a traffic violation (sideswiping a *calesa*) and detained until 3:00 P.M. [3, 4]. He presented his mother, Isidra Valera, and a police sergeant with a police blotter to corroborate this claim [4].

The trial court found the police blotter falsified and the alibi incredible, convicting Valera and sentencing him to *reclusión perpetua* and to indemnify the heirs P6,000.00 [2, 5]. Valera appealed, challenging the credibility of the witnesses and alleging a denial of due process because the trial court recalled a prosecution witness and allowed an unlisted witness to testify [5, 6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the trial court erred in rejecting the defense of alibi in favor of the prosecution's identification.
2. W/N the trial court denied the accused due process by recalling a witness and admitting the testimony of a witness not listed in the information.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that the alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of the prosecution witnesses, who were found to be credible and straightforward [5]. The Court affirmed the trial court's finding that the police blotter supporting the alibi was falsified and concocted to suit the defense [7, 8]. Furthermore, the testimony of Valera regarding his companion "Aning" was replete with inconsistencies, and his mother's testimony was suspect due to her admitted offer of money to a witness to refrain from testifying [8, 9].

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the power of the court to recall a witness to clarify matters or testify on other material points is discretionary and allowed to promote the ends of justice [6]. Regarding the unlisted witness, the rule is well-settled that unless the omission of the witness from the fiscal's list is intentional and tainted with bad faith, the court's right to call said witness cannot be disputed in the interest of justice [6].

**Decision affirmed.**
