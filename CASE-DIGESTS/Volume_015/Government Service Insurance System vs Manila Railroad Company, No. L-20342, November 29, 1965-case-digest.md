I. CAPTION
GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM (As Administrator of the Property Insurance Fund under R.A. No. 656) v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20342, November 29, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On May 22, 1956, a shipment of tractor parts consigned to NAMARCO was discharged from the vessel S.S. "Steel Architect" into the custody of the Manila Port Service (MPS), a subsidiary of the Manila Railroad Company. On June 11, 1956, a Customs examiner inspected the shipment and found it intact. However, when the cargo was delivered to the consignee's broker on June 12, 1956, it was short by 11 pieces. The broker filed a provisional claim with MPS on June 16, 1956.

GSIS, as the insurer, paid NAMARCO for the loss and sued MPS and Manila Railroad Company for reimbursement. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila initially ruled for GSIS but later dismissed the complaint via an "Amended Decision" because the claim was not filed within 15 days from the discharge of the goods as required by Section 15 of the Management Contract. On appeal, the Supreme Court remanded the case to determine when the consignee had knowledge of the arrival of goods. The CFI subsequently ruled in favor of GSIS, finding that the loss occurred after the 15-day period had already lapsed, making compliance with the condition impossible. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the claim for the lost goods is barred by the 15-day period prescribed in Section 15 of the Management Contract.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. While Section 15 of the Management Contract generally relieves the arrastre operator of liability if no claim is filed within 15 days from the date of discharge of the last package from the vessel, this rule is not strictly applied when it would be "unfair and iniquitous."

The Court cited *Consunji v. Manila Port Service* and *Yu Kimteng Construction v. Manila Railroad Co.*, establishing that where the consignee learns of the loss or damage only after the lapse of the 15-day period, the period should be counted not from the discharge of the goods, but from the date the consignee learned, or could have learned, of the loss. In this case, the discharge was on May 22, 1956, but the goods were delivered and the loss discovered only on June 12, 1956 (21 days later). Consequently, the provisional claim filed on June 16, 1956, was well within the 15-day period reckoned from the date of knowledge.

The judgment appealed from is affirmed.
