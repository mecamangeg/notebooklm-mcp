I. CAPTION
VIRGINIA I. VDA. DE LIMJOCO v. THE DIRECTOR OF COMMERCE, G.R. No. L-17640, November 29, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Limjoco owned a rice mill ("kiskisan") housed in a "camalig" (an enclosed structure). Customers delivered palay to be milled for a fee of P0.40 per cavan. Occasionally, when the palay delivered exceeded the mill's daily capacity, customers would leave their palay (ranging from 10 to 100 cavans) piled in the camalig to await milling. Limjoco did not charge storage fees for this arrangement, considering it a favor to customers to prevent them from going to competitors.

Upon the death of her husband, Limjoco continued the business but refused to renew the license required by the Bureau of Commerce. She argued that her business did not fall under the General Bonded Warehousing Act (Act No. 3893, as amended by R.A. 247) because she was engaged in milling, not storage. The Director of Commerce insisted she secure a license. Limjoco filed a petition for declaratory relief. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled against her, holding that the law is applicable to her business.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Limjoco’s rice milling business falls under the scope of Act No. 3893 regarding the "business of receiving rice for storage."
2. W/N the inclusion of milling in Act No. 3893 violates the constitutional requirement that the subject of an Act must be expressed in its title.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 2 of Act No. 3893 expressly provides that the "business of receiving rice for storage" includes "any contract or transaction wherein the rice delivered is to be milled for and on account of the owner thereof." The law is clear that mere *delivery* of palay, even if only for milling, is sufficient to trigger the Act. The Court noted that palay piled in the "camalig" while awaiting milling constitutes storage. Citing *People v. Versola*, the Court emphasized that the law intends to protect owners of the commodity from abuses or negligence by the person who has physical control over their property.

2. **NO.** The Court held that the title of Act No. 3893, "An Act to Regulate the Business of Receiving Commodity for Storage," is sufficiently broad to cover the business of milling palay where the commodity is delivered to the operator and kept in a structure serving as a warehouse. Furthermore, the fact that the "camalig" may be structurally inadequate for storage is not a valid defense; non-compliance with safety requirements cannot exempt a business from the liabilities imposed by the statute.

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
