I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. ANTONIO DY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20848, December 24, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Antonio Dy, a citizen of Nationalist China, filed a petition for naturalization on May 26, 1961. He claimed to be employed as a business associate and later manager at his father's store, "Chuan An Bazaar," in Manila. His salary allegedly increased from P80.00 to P250.00 per month just one month prior to filing the petition. At the time of filing, he was a full-time medical student at the University of the East. He also claimed income from private tutoring and contributing articles to the Chinese Commercial News. To support his exemption from filing a declaration of intention, he submitted a birth certificate bearing the name "Carmen Dy," not "Antonio Dy." The Court of First Instance of Manila granted his petition. The Republic appealed, arguing Dy failed to establish a lucrative income.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative income or occupation.
2. W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a declaration of intention.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A petitioner's qualifications are determined as of the time of the filing of the petition [1, 2]. The Court found Dy's income insufficient because his salary increase from P80 to P250 occurred only one month before filing, while he was a full-time medical student. Income from private tutoring and news contributions is considered "unsteady, contingent and irregular" and cannot be considered for gainful employment (*Tse v. Republic*) [2]. Furthermore, income allegedly derived from employment in a business enterprise of the petitioner's father is not sufficient to establish a lucrative occupation, especially when the business's profitability is unproven and the employment appears self-serving (*Sy Ang Hoc v. Republic*) [3].

2. **NO.** The petitioner failed to conclusively prove he was born in the Philippines, which is required to be exempt from filing a declaration of intention under Section 6 of the Revised Naturalization Law. The birth certificate submitted bore the name "Carmen Dy," and no explanation was given for the discrepancy [4]. This failure to file the declaration is fatal to the jurisdiction of the trial court [4].

The appealed decision is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DISMISSED**.
