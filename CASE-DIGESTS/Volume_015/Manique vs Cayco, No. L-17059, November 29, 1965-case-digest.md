**I. CAPTION**
PEDRO MANIQUE, ET AL. v. CEFERINO F. CAYCO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17059, November 29, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiffs Manique obtained a loan from defendants Cayco secured by a mortgage. Later, they executed a deed of absolute sale in favor of defendants with an option to repurchase. When plaintiffs failed to redeem or vacate, defendants filed an ejectment action in the Municipal Court. The parties reached a compromise agreement wherein plaintiffs recognized defendants' absolute ownership but were granted a one-year lease and an option to repurchase for P49,000.00. The Municipal Court rendered judgment based on this compromise.

Plaintiffs failed to comply, and a writ of execution was issued. Subsequently, plaintiffs filed a new action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon City, seeking to repurchase the property. Defendants moved to dismiss on the ground of *res judicata*, but the CFI rejected the defense, ruled the contract was merely a mortgage, and ordered defendants to execute a deed of sale upon payment. Defendants appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the judgment on compromise in the ejectment case bars the present action under the principle of *res judicata*.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the present action is barred. All elements of *res judicata* are present: identity of parties, identity of things, and identity of questions involved [1]. Under Article 2037 of the Civil Code, a compromise has upon the parties the effect and authority of *res judicata*. Furthermore, a judgment on compromise is not appealable and is immediately executory unless a motion is filed to set it aside on the ground of fraud, mistake, or duress [2, 3]. Since no such motion was filed, the judgment became final.

The Court also rejected the argument that the Municipal Court judgment was a nullity for lacking findings of fact or law. When a compromise agreement is approved by a court and embodied in a decision, the court merely adopts the statement of facts and law reached therein [4, 5].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**.
