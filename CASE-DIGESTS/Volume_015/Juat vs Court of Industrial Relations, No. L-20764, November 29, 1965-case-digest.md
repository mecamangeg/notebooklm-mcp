I. CAPTION
SANTOS JUAT v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, BULAKLAK PUBLICATIONS and JUAN EVANGELISTA, G.R. No. L-20764, November 29, 1965, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Santos Juat had been an employee of respondent Bulaklak Publications since 1953 [1]. On December 1, 1959, the company entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with the Busocope Labor Union, which contained a closed-shop proviso [2]. This agreement was amended in 1960 to explicitly require all employees who were not union members as of January 1, 1961, to join the union as a condition of continued employment [3]. Juat, who was not a member of any labor union, refused to join the Busocope Labor Union despite the requirement [1, 4]. Consequently, he was suspended for 15 days [5]. When ordered to return to work after his suspension, Juat failed to do so, allegedly because he was occupied with his own business, Juat Printing Press Co. [5]. He was subsequently dismissed from service [5]. Juat filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice against the respondents, arguing that as an old employee, the closed-shop provision should not apply to him [1, 6]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) dismissed the complaint, ruling that his dismissal was justified [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the closed-shop proviso in a CBA applies to an old employee who is not a member of any labor union.
2. W/N the dismissal of the petitioner for refusal to join the union constituted Unfair Labor Practice.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the closed-shop proviso applies to old employees who are not members of any labor union at the time the CBA is entered into [9, 10]. Citing *Freeman Shirt Manufacturing Co. v. CIR*, the Court explained that while closed-shop agreements cannot compel employees who are already members of *another* minority union to disaffiliate and join the contracting union (as this would violate their right to self-organization), this exemption does not apply to employees who belong to no union at all [9, 11]. Since Juat was not a member of any labor union, he could validly be obliged to join the Busocope Labor Union under the CBA sanctioned by Section 4(a)(4) of Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act) [8, 12].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the respondent company did not commit Unfair Labor Practice [13]. Because the closed-shop provision validly applied to Juat, his refusal to join the contracting union constituted a justifiable basis for his dismissal [8]. Furthermore, the Court noted that Juat provided another ground for his dismissal by refusing to return to work after his suspension, as he was working for his own printing press [13].

The decision and resolution appealed from are affirmed [14].
