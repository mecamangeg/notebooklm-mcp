I. CAPTION
*In the Matter of the Change of Name of the Minor Baby Go to Albert Go. Gregorio Go v. Republic of the Philippines*, G.R. No. L-20160, November 29, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Gregorio Go filed a petition to change the name of the minor "Baby Go" to "Albert Go" [1, 2]. The name "Baby" was registered by representatives of the Cebu Maternity Hospital, where the child was born, without the parents' knowledge or consent [3]. The petitioner argued that "Baby" is not a Christian name and sought to adopt "Albert" to conform with Filipino Catholic practices [3]. The Court of First Instance of Cebu granted the petition [2]. The Republic appealed, arguing that the lower court's order violated Article 408 of the Civil Code and Section 10 of Act No. 3753 [4]. The Solicitor General contended that while the law authorizes recording a name change, it does not permit the alteration or erasure of original entries in the Civil Registry, rendering the order void [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court's order changing the name was proper in light of the laws governing the Civil Registry.

IV. RULING
**YES, but with modification.** The Supreme Court found that the petitioner's allegations were true and that there was proper and reasonable cause to change the name under Rule 103, Section 5 of the Rules of Court [5, 6]. However, the Court clarified that the lower court's order must not be construed to authorize erasures or cancellations of the original name "Baby Go" in the Civil Registry [6]. Citing the cases of *Ansaldo v. Republic* and *Roces v. Local Civil Registrar*, the Court held that the change must be effected only through proper marginal corrections or annotations in the Civil Registry [6]. The judgment was modified to reflect this limitation [6].
