**I. CAPTION**
**PROCOPIO R. MORALES, JR. v. TORIANO PATRIARCA AND THE HON. JUAN R. LIWAG**, G.R. No. L-21280, October 21, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Morales, the Justice of the Peace of San Andres, Quezon, was ordered to vacate his office by the Secretary of Justice. On April 3, 1962, the Secretary denied Morales' motion for reconsideration of the order to vacate and subsequently refused to authorize his salaries, effectively dismissing him [1]. Respondent Patriarca assumed the disputed office on October 26, 1962 [1]. Morales filed a suit titled "Quo Warranto, Prohibition, Injunction, Etc." seeking to compel the Secretary of Justice to recognize him as the rightful Justice of the Peace and pay his emoluments [2]. The Supreme Court previously dismissed the petition on April 30, 1965, ruling that the action for reinstatement was filed more than one year from his removal [3]. Morales filed a petition for relief (second motion for reconsideration), arguing that the one-year prescriptive period should be counted from October 26, 1962, when Patriarca assumed office, as that was the only time *quo warranto* proceedings could be initiated [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner's action for reinstatement is barred by the one-year prescriptive period counted from the date of his dismissal.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that the action is barred. The suit is in substance an action for *mandamus* to compel the Secretary of Justice to reinstate the petitioner [2]. Unlike *quo warranto*, *mandamus* does not require that the respondent be actually holding the disputed office [4, 5]. Therefore, the petitioner could have filed the action for reinstatement as early as April 3, 1962, when his dismissal was implemented, and was not precluded from doing so by the fact that he was not immediately replaced by another [5].

The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Unabia v. Mayor* that the one-year limitation for bringing an action for reinstatement applies to *mandamus* as well as *quo warranto* proceedings [6]. Citing *Tumulak v. Egay*, the Court emphasized that public interest requires title to public office to be determined speedily to avoid "continued uncertainty" [6]. Since the petitioner failed to question the legality of his removal within the prescribed one-year period from his dismissal, the action is untenable [6, 7].

The petition for relief is denied [8].
