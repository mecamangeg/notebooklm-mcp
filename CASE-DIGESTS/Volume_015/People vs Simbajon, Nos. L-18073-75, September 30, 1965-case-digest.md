I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BONIFACIO SIMBAJON, ET AL.**, G.R. Nos. L-18073-75, September 30, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Political rivalry existed between Victoriano Simbajon and Sofronio Avanceña, the Mayor of Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental, who allegedly committed abuses against Simbajon's followers. On November 13, 1959, Victoriano, his sons (Bonifacio, Feliciano, and Panfilo), and son-in-law Arturo Yap conspired to kill Avanceña. The following morning, Victoriano publicly "surrendered" to Avanceña and shook his hand as a ruse to catch him off guard. Later, as Avanceña and his police companions passed near the house of Isabelo Plaza, shots were fired from the window, killing Avanceña and wounding Chief of Police Macalisang and Patrolman Dominguez.

Bonifacio surrendered and confessed to the shooting. The Court of First Instance convicted the Simbajons of Murder and two counts of Frustrated Murder. Bonifacio did not appeal. Victoriano, Feliciano, and Panfilo appealed, challenging the sufficiency of evidence against them and the use of the extrajudicial confessions made by Bonifacio and Feliciano.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the extrajudicial confessions of the co-accused are admissible against the appellants to prove conspiracy and guilt.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that while an extrajudicial confession is generally admissible only against the person who made it, it may be admitted as **corroborative evidence** of other facts that tend to establish the guilt of the other defendants [1, 2].

Here, the extrajudicial confessions of Bonifacio and Feliciano detailing the plan were corroborated by conclusive facts: Victoriano acted as the leader, owned the guns used, bought the ammunition, and executed the "surrender" ruse [3, 4]. Feliciano’s presence and participation were confirmed by his own confession and corroborating circumstances [5]. Panfilo was identified in the victim's ante-mortem statement, and physical evidence (a rifle with the smell of gunpowder found where he was hiding) linked him to the crime [6, 7]. The Court affirmed the conviction, finding all appellants guilty of the offenses charged [7, 8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. Concepcion, Reyes J.B.L., Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., and Zaldivar, JJ., concurred [8].
