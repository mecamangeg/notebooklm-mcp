I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION ASSOCIATION, INC., ET AL. v. PEDRO M. GIMENEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23326, December 18, 1965, 15 SCRA 479, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Philippine Constitution Association, Inc. (Philconsa), a non-profit civic organization of taxpayers, filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction against the Auditor General and disbursing officers of Congress [1, 2]. They challenged the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 3836, approved on June 22, 1963, which amended Commonwealth Act No. 186 (the GSIS Charter) [3]. RA 3836 allowed Senators and Members of the House of Representatives to retire after serving at least twelve years, regardless of age, with a gratuity equivalent to one year’s salary for every four years of service, payable by the employer/office concerned [4, 5]. Petitioners argued the law violated the Constitutional requirement regarding the title of bills, the ban on increasing compensation during a term, and the equal protection clause [6, 7]. Respondents contended that petitioners lacked standing to sue [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Philconsa has the standing to institute the suit.
2. W/N RA 3836 violates the Constitutional prohibition on the increase of compensation of members of Congress (Art. VI, Sec. 14).
3. W/N RA 3836 violates the equal protection clause.
4. W/N the title of RA 3836 is germane to its subject matter.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Taxpayers have sufficient interest to prevent the illegal expenditure of public funds raised by taxation. The Court held that where a statute involves the disbursement of public funds, taxpayers may question its constitutionality, especially when the petitioners are substantial taxpayers and the outcome affects their vital interests [9, 10].

2. **YES.** RA 3836 violates Article VI, Section 14 of the Constitution. Retirement benefits constitute "emoluments" or compensation for services [11]. The Constitution prohibits any increase in the compensation of members of Congress from taking effect until after the expiration of the full term of all members approving such increase. RA 3836 made the retirement benefits immediately available upon approval, thereby circumventing the constitutional prohibition [11-13].

3. **YES.** The law violates the equal protection clause as it is patently discriminatory. It grants retirement benefits to members of Congress after only 12 years of service (compared to 20 for others), without age limits, and without requiring membership in the GSIS, while excluding other elective officials such as provincial governors and municipal mayors [14-16]. The classification was deemed unreasonable and not based on substantial distinctions [17].

4. **NO.** The title of RA 3836, which purports to amend the GSIS Charter (CA 186), is not germane to the provision granting benefits to members of Congress who are not members of the GSIS [18, 19]. The requirement that the subject of an Act be expressed in its title is mandatory to prevent surprise and fraud. Since the retirement of non-GSIS members is foreign to the subject of the GSIS Charter, the title is void [20, 21].

The petition is granted, and Republic Act No. 3836 is declared **NULL and VOID** insofar as it refers to the retirement of members of Congress and elected officials thereof [22].
