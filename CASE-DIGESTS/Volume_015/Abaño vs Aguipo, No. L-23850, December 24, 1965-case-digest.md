**I. CAPTION**
GUILLERMO D. ABAÑO v. SOFRONIO D. AGUIPO, G.R. No. L-23850, December 24, 1965, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Abaño, originally the Chief of the Secret Service Division of Ormoc City, was designated by President Garcia on February 17, 1960, as Acting Chief of Police in place of the regular incumbent, Ciriaco Porcadilla, who was suspended due to a pending criminal case. On November 17, 1961, Abaño was appointed Assistant Chief of Police but continued to discharge the duties of Acting Chief. On January 5, 1962, President Macapagal terminated Abaño's designation and designated Respondent Aguipo as Acting Chief of Police. Aguipo qualified and eventually assumed office. Abaño filed a petition for *quo warranto*. The Court of First Instance initially dismissed the petition but, upon a motion for reconsideration, reversed its decision, ruling that Abaño’s designation was not temporary and could not be terminated by the President under Commonwealth Act No. 588. The case was certified to the Supreme Court on questions of law.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the President has the power to terminate Petitioner's designation as Acting Chief of Police and appoint Respondent in his place.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court held that Section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 588 empowers the President to appoint a substitute for an officer unable to perform duties due to illness, absence, or "other cause," which includes the suspension of the regular incumbent [1, 2]. The Court reiterated the established doctrine in *Austria v. Amante* and *Castro v. Solidum* that a mere designation to an office in an acting capacity is inherently temporary and revocable [3-5]. Since Petitioner was merely designated acting chief, he had no fixed tenure, and the President could terminate said designation at any time to appoint another [3, 4]. The lower court's reliance on *Baguio v. Rodriguez* was incorrect as that case involved the removal of a permanent officer protected by Civil Service Law, unlike the Petitioner who held the position only in an acting capacity [6].

Accordingly, the decision of the Court of First Instance is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DISMISSED**.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Concepcion and Barrera, *JJ.*, concurred in the result.
