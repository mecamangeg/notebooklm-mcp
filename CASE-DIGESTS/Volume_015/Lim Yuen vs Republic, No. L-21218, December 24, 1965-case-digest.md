I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF LIM YUEN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. LIM YUEN, petitioner-appellee, vs. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, oppositor-appellant, G.R. No. L-21218, December 24, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Lim Yuen filed a petition for naturalization on November 11, 1960, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Isabela [1, 2]. The Republic, through the Solicitor General, appealed the decision, arguing that Lim Yuen was disqualified because he failed to evince a sincere desire to embrace Filipino customs, traditions, and ideals [1]. This argument was based on the fact that Lim Yuen enrolled his children—specifically Charles, Lucia, and Henry—in Santiago Chinese School, and his daughter Lolita in St. Theresa's Chinese Academy [3, 4]. Although Lim Yuen eventually transferred Charles, Lucia, and Henry to Northeastern College (a school populated by Filipino citizens), this transfer occurred only *after* the Solicitor General had already moved for the reconsideration of the lower court's decision granting naturalization [3, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is disqualified from naturalization due to the enrollment of his children in Chinese schools.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the enrollment of the petitioner's children in Chinese schools constitutes a failure to evidence a sincere desire to embrace Filipino customs, traditions, and ideals, which is a disqualification under Section 4, paragraph (f) of Commonwealth Act No. 473 [3]. The Court reasoned that Filipino ideals can hardly be imbibed in schools where the student population is almost entirely Chinese [4, 5].

The Court further ruled that the subsequent transfer of the children to a Filipino school did not cure the defect because the transfer took place *after* the Solicitor General had already challenged the lower court's decision [3, 6]. The law requires an applicant to show by positive, overt, and convincing acts an earnest wish to embrace Filipino customs prior to and at the time of filing the petition and the hearing; the petitioner's belated actions failed to meet this standard [4, 5]. Consequently, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED** [7].
