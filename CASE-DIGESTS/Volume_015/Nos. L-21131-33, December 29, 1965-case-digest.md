I. CAPTION
SIMEON O. CRUZ, ET AL. v. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-21131-33, December 29, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Tenants (private respondents) filed petitions before the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) against petitioners (landlords) for the liquidation of their palay harvest on a 70-30 basis [1]. During a joint hearing, the parties and their counsel reached an amicable settlement dictated in open court [2]. This agreement was reduced to writing and signed *only* by the counsel of the parties, not by the parties themselves [2, 3]. The CAR rendered a decision approving and enjoining compliance with the settlement [2]. Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration claiming certain agreed terms were omitted, but the CAR denied the motion [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the amicable settlement approved by the lower court is valid despite being signed only by counsel and not the parties.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the settlement was invalid. Under Section 2, Rule 9 of the Rules of the Court of Agrarian Relations, any agreement settling a dispute must be reduced to writing, signed, and acknowledged by the *parties* themselves before the Judge [5, 6]. In this case, the agreement was signed only by counsel, violating the rule [3]. The Court emphasized that this requirement is intended to protect tenants' interests by giving them direct intervention in settlements [7]. Furthermore, under the Rules of Court (Section 21, Rule 127, old; Section 28, Rule 138, new), counsel cannot compromise a litigation without express authority from the client, which was not proven here [8]. The settlement could not be sustained to the prejudice of the tenants [8].

The decision appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [8, 9].
