I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE PRODUCTS COMPANY v. PRIMATERIA SOCIETE ANONYME POUR LE COMMERCE EXTERIEUR, PRIMATERIA (PHILIPPINES) INC., ALEXANDER G. BAYLIN, and JOSE M. CRAME, G.R. No. L-17160, November 29, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Primateria Societe Anonyme Pour Le Commerce Exterieur (Primateria Zurich), a foreign entity based in Switzerland, entered into an agreement with Philippine Products Company (PPC) to buy copra and other products. Primateria Zurich transacted through its agents in the Philippines: Primateria (Philippines) Inc., Alexander G. Baylin, and Jose M. Crame. It is undisputed that Primateria Zurich was not licensed to transact business in the Philippines [1, 2].

PPC filed a suit to recover P33,009.71 representing the amount due from copra shipments [1, 3]. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila rendered judgment holding Primateria Zurich liable for P31,009.71 but absolved the agents (Primateria Philippines, Baylin, and Crame) from liability [4]. PPC appealed, arguing that under Sections 68 and 69 of the Corporation Law, agents of a foreign corporation transacting business without a license should be personally liable [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the agents of a foreign entity doing business in the Philippines without a license are personally liable for contracts entered into on behalf of the principal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the lower court's decision absolving the agents.

First, the Court agreed with the CFI that Primateria Zurich was not proven to be a foreign "corporation" but rather a *société anonyme*. The Court noted that Philippine law recognizes a difference between *sociedades anonimas* and corporations; thus, failing such proof, the entity does not fall under the prescription of Section 68 of the Corporation Law [6].

Second, the Court held that PPC could not recover from *both* the principal and its agents. PPC had already obtained a judgment against the principal, Primateria Zurich, for the full amount and did not appeal that portion. Article 1897 of the New Civil Code does not state that in cases of excess authority, both the agent and principal are liable [6, 7].

Finally, the Court ruled that in the absence of express legislation, the liability of the agent of a foreign corporation doing business without a license is premised on the inability to sue the principal or the non-liability thereof. Since the principal (Primateria Zurich) was successfully sued and held liable, the agents cannot be held personally responsible [8-10].

**Judgment affirmed.**
