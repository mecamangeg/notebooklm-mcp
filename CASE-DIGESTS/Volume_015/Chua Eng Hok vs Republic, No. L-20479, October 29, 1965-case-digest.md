I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR NATURALIZATION AS A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, CHUA ENG HOK v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20479, October 29, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On June 6, 1959, Chua Eng Hok, a Chinese subject, filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [1]. He was married to a Filipino and had three children at the time of filing, which later increased to four [1, 2]. He reported an annual income of P4,000.00 from his employment at Central Manufacturing Corporation [2]. On May 3, 1960, the CFI granted the petition [3]. However, on October 12, 1962, before the decision became final and executory after the statutory two-year period, the Republic filed a petition objecting to the petitioner's oath-taking [3]. The Republic argued that the petitioner failed to state all former places of residence, that the notice was published in a newspaper not of general circulation ("Daily Record"), and that his income was not lucrative [4]. The CFI denied the Republic's objections, leading to this appeal [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's annual income of P4,000.00 is considered lucrative for naturalization purposes.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that an annual income of P4,000.00 is not considered lucrative for an applicant with a wife and four children to support [5]. Citing established jurisprudence such as *Uy v. Republic* and *Go Bon The v. Republic*, the Court highlighted that even higher incomes have been deemed insufficient for similar family sizes [5, 6]. The Court emphasized that Philippine citizenship is a "precious heritage" involving political status and should not be easily given away; applicants must prove strict compliance with all legal requirements to the satisfaction of the Court [7]. Although the Court noted that the failure to state former residences and the defective publication were also meritorious grounds for denial, it primarily grounded the reversal on the financial requirement [5].

Decision reversed [8].
