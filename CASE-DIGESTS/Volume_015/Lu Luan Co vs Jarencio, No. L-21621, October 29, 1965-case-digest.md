**I. CAPTION**
LU LUAN CO v. HON. HILARION U. JARENCIO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21621, October 29, 1965, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
In early 1960, petitioner Lu Luan Co filed an application for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Laguna [1]. The Office of the Solicitor General authorized the Assistant Provincial Fiscal of Laguna to represent the government specifically at the hearing of the application [1, 2]. On April 25, 1961, the trial court rendered judgment granting petitioner Philippine citizenship, subject to the two-year probationary period required by law [1]. The Solicitor General received notice of this judgment on May 8, 1961 [3].

On May 3, 1963, petitioner filed a motion to take his oath of allegiance, furnishing a copy to the Provincial Fiscal but not to the Solicitor General [3]. The hearing was set for May 11, 1963, without notice to the Solicitor General [3]. The vacation judge, Judge Nañawa, allowed the motion, and petitioner took his oath and received his Certificate of Naturalization on the same day [4, 5]. On June 3, 1963, respondent Judge Jarencio set aside the order allowing the oath-taking, ruling that the Solicitor General was not notified and that the two-year period had not yet expired reckoned from the Solicitor General's receipt of the decision [6]. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition to annul Judge Jarencio's order [7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the respondent judge committed grave abuse of discretion in setting aside the oath-taking due to the lack of notice to the Solicitor General.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the respondent judge did not commit any abuse of discretion [8]. The authority previously granted by the Office of the Solicitor General to the Assistant Provincial Fiscal was limited only to representing the State at the initial hearing held on April 25, 1961 [2]. Therefore, the petitioner was required to serve the motion to take the oath of allegiance and the notice of the hearing directly to the Office of the Solicitor General, which he failed to do [2, 9].

Furthermore, since the Solicitor General received notice of the judgment on May 8, 1961, the two-year probationary period had not yet expired when the petitioner filed his motion on May 3, 1963 [8]. The lower court correctly set aside the proceedings to give the Solicitor General ample opportunity to investigate the petitioner's conduct during the intervening two years [9, 10].

The writs prayed for are denied [8].
