I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE COMPANY v. CITY OF DAVAO and the PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-23080, October 30, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
The City Council of Davao passed Resolutions Nos. 664 and 2015 to establish and operate a municipal telephone system. Petitioner Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) challenged the City's authority to do so. On September 20, 1965, the Supreme Court rendered a decision upholding the City's power. PLDT filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that: (1) the telephone system is proprietary in nature and cannot be undertaken under the General Welfare Clause; (2) the specific power in the City Charter to *regulate* telephone services implies a denial of the power to *operate* them; and (3) the City requires a special legislative franchise to operate the system. PLDT further contended that competition would be economically wasteful.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Davao City has the authority to operate a telephone system under the General Welfare Clause.
2. W/N the City's specific charter power to regulate telephone services implies a prohibition against operating its own system.
3. W/N Davao City requires a special legislative franchise to operate the telephone system.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The General Welfare Clause authorizes the City to operate a telephone system. While the system may serve a proprietary function, it also serves critical governmental functions such as securing peace and order, safeguarding health, and aiding in fire and flood control [1-3]. Governmental and proprietary functions often overlap, as seen in municipal water and light systems. To limit the General Welfare Clause only to functions without proprietary aspects would cripple local governments [1, 4]. Furthermore, Section 12 of Republic Act No. 2264 (Local Autonomy Act) mandates that the General Welfare Clause be liberally interpreted to give more power to local governments [5].

2. **NO.** The principle relied upon by PLDT from *People v. Esguerra*—that the power to regulate implies the withholding of the power to prohibit—does not apply. *Esguerra* involved the suppression of an existing right. Here, the City is not prohibiting PLDT’s operations but is *creating* or giving existence to a new service [6, 7]. The General Welfare Clause acts as an independent delegation of police power sufficient to justify the City's action [8, 9].

3. **NO.** Republic Act No. 4354 expressly empowers Davao City to operate and maintain a telephone system [10]. Requiring a separate special franchise would render these enabling provisions in the Charter useless. Since the City Council is delegated the legislative power to grant franchises, it would be absurd to require the City to file an application for a franchise with its own Council [11]. Finally, public policy does not always favor monopolies; competition may inure to the public welfare [12, 13].

Motion for reconsideration is denied.
