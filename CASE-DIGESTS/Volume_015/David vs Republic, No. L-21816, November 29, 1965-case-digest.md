I. CAPTION
CEFERINA V. DAVID v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21816, November 29, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Ceferina V. David filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of Manila under Article 412 of the Civil Code to correct entries in the birth certificate of her son [1]. She sought to change the child's name from "Raul Sabile" to "Raul David," delete the father's name, change her name from "Ceferina D. Sabile" to "Ceferina V. David," and delete the date and place of marriage, claiming she was never married and the child is illegitimate [1], [2]. The Civil Registrar opposed the petition, arguing the errors were not apparent and the changes were substantial and controversial [3]. The lower court denied the petition, ruling that the sought corrections were substantial in nature and could not be made through a summary proceeding under Article 412 [3]. Petitioner appealed, citing *Roces v. The Local Civil Registrar of Manila* [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the substantial corrections affecting the civil status of the petitioner and her child can be granted via a summary proceeding under Article 412 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that corrections allowed under Article 412 of the Civil Code are strictly limited to those merely clerical in character, such as harmless or innocuous errors (e.g., misspelled names or parental occupation), and do not extend to changes affecting civil status, nationality, or citizenship (*Ty Kong Tin v. Republic*; *Ansaldo v. Republic*) [4]. The corrections petitioner sought were substantial, as granting them would alter the child's status from legitimate to illegitimate and the mother's status from married to single [5], [6]. Such relief requires an appropriate adversary proceeding where all concerned parties, including the State, are impleaded to ensure due process [4]. The Court distinguished this case from *Roces*, noting that here, the information was supplied by the petitioner or her grandmother—who knew the truth—rather than a third-party physician [7]. The order appealed from is affirmed [8].
