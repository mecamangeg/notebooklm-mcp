I. CAPTION
Gaspar v. Dorado, G.R. No. L-17884, November 29, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Vicente Alamodin owned an undivided half portion of a residential lot in Roxas City. In November 1955, C.N. Hodges filed a collection suit against Alamodin in the Municipal Court of Iloilo City [1]. While this suit was pending, Alamodin sold his portion of the lot to plaintiff-appellee Adolfo Gaspar on January 4, 1956, and the sale was registered on February 15, 1956 [2]. Subsequently, on February 27, 1956, the Municipal Court rendered judgment in favor of Hodges [1]. A writ of execution was issued, and the Provincial Sheriff (Dorado) levied on the same property. Despite Gaspar's third-party claim, the property was sold at public auction to Hodges on October 17, 1956, after Hodges posted an indemnity bond with Visayan Surety & Insurance Co. [3].

Gaspar filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Capiz. Originally, he alleged ownership and questioned the validity of the sheriff's sale but only prayed for damages totaling P1,400 [4]. Defendants argued the CFI lacked jurisdiction as the amount was below the jurisdictional limit. Gaspar was allowed to amend his complaint to expressly pray for the annulment of the sheriff's sale [4]. The CFI ruled in favor of Gaspar, declaring his title valid and the sheriff's sale void [4]. Hodges appealed, questioning the court's jurisdiction to admit the amended complaint [5].

III. ISSUES
1. W/N the trial court erred in admitting the amended complaint to confer jurisdiction, given that the original prayer for damages was below its jurisdictional amount.
2. W/N the sale to Gaspar was fraudulent and should be set aside in favor of the execution sale to Hodges under Article 1387 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The admission of the amended complaint was proper. While an amendment cannot confer jurisdiction if the court initially had none over the subject matter, the allegations of the original complaint must be considered as a whole [6]. In his original complaint, Gaspar put in issue the validity of the sheriff's sale and claimed exclusive ownership by virtue of a prior registered sale [6]. The resolution of this question of ownership and validity was the predicate for the damages claim and falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance [6]. The amendment expressly praying for annulment was merely a matter of form, not substance [6].

2. **NO.** The sale to Gaspar was valid and superior to the sheriff's sale. The presumption of fraud under Article 1387 of the Civil Code applies to alienations made by persons against whom a judgment has been rendered or a writ of attachment issued [7]. This presumption does not apply here because the judgment for Hodges was rendered on February 27, 1956, *after* the sale to Gaspar on January 4, 1956, and no writ of attachment was ever issued [7]. Furthermore, the lone circumstance that the sale occurred after the collection suit had begun is insufficient to prove fraud [8]. The evidence showed Gaspar acted in good faith: he was unaware of the pending suit in a different city, had a valid interest as his house stood on the lot, and the sale was duly registered prior to the levy on execution [8, 9].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [9].
