I. CAPTION
ANTONIO QUA alias QUA ENG KIANG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21418, December 31, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On May 25, 1960, petitioner Antonio Qua filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Albay. The court granted the petition on December 22, 1960. The Provincial Fiscal initially appealed but withdrew it on February 24, 1961. On December 13, 1962, Qua petitioned to take his oath, claiming compliance with the two-year probationary period. On December 22, 1962, the court allowed him to take the oath, which he did that same day. The Provincial Fiscal received this order on December 23, 1962, but the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) only received it on March 13, 1963. On March 29, 1963, the OSG filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing the decision was not yet executory. The lower court denied the motion, ruling that the order was already final based on the Fiscal's receipt. The Republic appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the period to file a Motion for Reconsideration is reckoned from the receipt of the order by the Solicitor General or the Provincial Fiscal.
2. W/N the two-year probationary period under Republic Act No. 530 is computed from the rendition of the lower court's decision or from its finality.

IV. RULING
1. **Solicitor General.** The Court held that the appearance of the City Attorney or Provincial Fiscal does not divest the Solicitor General of control over the State's defense. The Solicitor General remains the counsel of record. Thus, the period to file a motion for reconsideration is determined by the date the Solicitor General received the copy of the order (March 13, 1963), not the date it was received by the Fiscal (December 23, 1962). Consequently, the OSG's motion filed on March 29, 1963, was timely [1-3].

2. **Finality.** **YES**, the period runs from finality. While RA 530 mentions "promulgation," the Court clarified that trial courts "render" decisions, while "promulgation" technically refers to appellate decisions. To serve the law's intent of testing the applicant's sincerity, the two-year period must be computed from the date the lower court decision becomes **final** (if not appealed) or from the promulgation of the Supreme Court decision (if appealed). Since the appeal was withdrawn on February 24, 1961, the two-year period commenced then, meaning the oath taken on December 22, 1962, was premature [4-6].

The order appealed from is set aside, and the case is remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings.
