I. CAPTION
BENJAMIN NAVARRO v. VICTORIANO BACALLA, G.R. No. L-20607, October 14, 1965, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
On January 23, 1962, plaintiff-appellant Benjamin Navarro, a minor represented by his mother Ceferina S. Navarro, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu against defendant-appellee Victoriano Bacalla for compulsory recognition, support, and damages [1]. Ceferina testified that Bacalla impregnated her and that she had no other affairs during the conception [2]. The CFI found as a fact that the defendant had carnal intercourse with Ceferina and that the plaintiff was born of this illicit relation [3]. However, the CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that the mother's testimony was not the kind of evidence contemplated by Article 283 of the New Civil Code (NCC) [3]. The trial court interpreted "evidence" under this Article as limited to evidence of pedigree (hearsay exceptions) under the Rules of Court [4]. Plaintiff appealed directly to the Supreme Court on a question of law [5]. Defendant did not appeal the factual finding of paternity [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the testimony of the mother identifying the defendant as the father constitutes "any evidence or proof" sufficient to compel recognition under Article 283, paragraph 4 of the Civil Code [4, 6].

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the mother's testimony falls within the broad scope of Article 283, paragraph 4 of the New Civil Code, which obliges a father to recognize a child "When the child has in his favor any evidence or proof that the defendant is his father" [2, 6].

The Court rejected the lower court's interpretation that this provision is limited to the hearsay exceptions regarding pedigree found in the Rules of Court (formerly Rule 123, now Rule 130) [2]. While the Rules allow relationship to be proved by hearsay (e.g., family reputation), this does not preclude proof by testimonial evidence based on personal knowledge [2, 7]. Since the defendant's paternity was established by the mother's unobjected testimony and the trial court's factual finding was not appealed, the fact of paternity is undisputed [8, 9]. Once paternity is established by evidence, the father must be compelled to recognize the child [9].

Accordingly, the judgment was set aside, and the defendant was ordered to recognize the plaintiff, pay monthly support of P40.00, moral damages, and attorney's fees [10].
