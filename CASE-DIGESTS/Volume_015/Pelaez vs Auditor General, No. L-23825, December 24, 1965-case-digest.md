I. CAPTION
EMMANUEL PELAEZ v. THE AUDITOR GENERAL, G.R. No. L-23825, December 24, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Between September 4 and October 29, 1964, the President of the Philippines issued Executive Orders Nos. 93 to 121, 124, and 126 to 129, creating thirty-three (33) new municipalities pursuant to Section 68 of the Revised Administrative Code [1]. These Executive Orders were issued after legislative bills for the creation of said municipalities had failed to pass Congress [2]. Petitioner Emmanuel Pelaez, as Vice President and taxpayer, filed a special civil action for prohibition to restrain the Auditor General from passing in audit any expenditure of public funds for these municipalities [1]. Pelaez argued that Section 68 constitutes an undue delegation of legislative power and has been impliedly repealed by Republic Act No. 2370 (the Barrio Charter) and the 1935 Constitution [3], [4]. The Respondent claimed the action was premature and that the power to create municipalities was a valid delegation [3], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Section 68 of the Revised Administrative Code constitutes an undue delegation of legislative power to the President.
2. W/N the President has the power to create municipalities under the 1935 Constitution.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 68 constitutes an undue delegation of legislative power. The authority to create municipal corporations is essentially legislative in nature, not administrative [6]. While Congress may delegate the power to fill in details, the law must be complete in itself and fix a sufficient standard [7]. Section 68 fails to meet these requirements as it does not enunciate a policy to be carried out nor provide a determinate standard [8]. The phrase "as the public welfare may require" is insufficient in this context because the creation of municipalities involves purely legislative questions of public policy, not mere questions of fact [9], [10]. Upholding such delegation would allow the President to do anything required by public opinion, leading to a virtual abdication of legislative powers [10].

2. **NO.** The President lacks the power to create municipalities because Section 68 is deemed repealed by the 1935 Constitution. The Constitution limits the President's authority over local governments to "general supervision," expressly denying the power of "control" [2], [11]. The power to create a municipality necessarily implies a power of control—or even greater authority—as it involves the ability to abolish offices or compel officials to submit to dictation by threatening to reorganize their territories [12], [13]. This contradicts the constitutional mandate of local autonomy [4]. Furthermore, since Republic Act No. 2370 denied the President the power to create barrios, it implies a negation of the greater power to create municipalities [14], [15].

The Executive Orders are declared null and void *ab initio*, and the respondent is permanently restrained from passing in audit expenditures for the implementation of said orders [16].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Bengzon, J.P., J.** (Concurring and Dissenting): Concurs that the Executive Orders are void because the Constitution repealed Section 68, as the power to create implies the power to control, which is denied to the President [17], [18]. Dissents regarding Republic Act No. 2370, arguing that the statutory prohibition on creating barrios does not necessarily preclude the President from creating municipalities, as autonomy should proceed from the bottom up [19], [20].
