I. CAPTION
BLUE BAR COCONUT COMPANY v. THE CITY OF ZAMBOANGA, G.R. No. L-20426, December 24, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Blue Bar Coconut Company (Blue Bar) filed an action to recover license taxes paid under protest to the City of Zamboanga, questioning the validity of City Ordinances Nos. 340 and 357 (Series of 1950) regarding the sale and export of coconuts [1]. The Court of First Instance of Zamboanga City ruled in favor of Blue Bar, relying on the Supreme Court's previous decision in *Zamboanga Copra Procurement Corp. v. Zamboanga City* (G.R. No. L-14806) which declared said ordinances void and *ultra vires* [1]. The trial court ordered the City Treasurer to refund P12,397.47 to Blue Bar, plus interest at the legal rate from the filing of the complaint, and P400.00 as reasonable attorney's fees [1]. The City appealed directly to the Supreme Court on a question of law, challenging only the award of interest and attorney's fees [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the City of Zamboanga is liable for the payment of interest on taxes illegally collected and attorney's fees.

IV. RULING
**YES.** A municipal corporation may be required to pay interest on taxes illegally collected by it, irrespective of its good faith [4, 5]. The Court relied on the doctrine established in *Macondray & Co. v. Sarmiento* (90 Phil. 709) and *Vda. e Hijos de Roxas v. Rafferty* (37 Phil. 957), reasoning that the City is liable for interest because it has had the use of the taxpayer's money from the date of the illegal exaction [3-5].

Regarding attorney's fees, the Court held that the taxpayer is entitled to recover them in an action to recover improperly exacted license taxes [2]. To rule otherwise would result in injustice, as the taxpayer would be compelled to lose the amount of attorney's fees merely to recover money they should not have been deprived of in the first place [5].

WHEREFORE, the decision and order appealed from are affirmed, with costs against appellant [6].
