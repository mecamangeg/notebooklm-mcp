I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE CHANGE OF NAME OF TY BIO GIAO, TY BIO GIAO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18669, November 29, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner-appellee Ty Bio Giao, a Chinese national residing in Ormoc City, filed a petition on January 18, 1961, to change his name to "Vicente Ty." He alleged that his true name "Ty Bio Giao" evokes derisive laughter and abusive comments in the Visayan dialect, causing him embarrassment and handicapping his social and business dealings. He further claimed "Vicente Ty" was the name given to him at his baptism in 1927. The City Attorney of Ormoc City opposed the petition. The Court of First Instance of Leyte granted the petition. The Republic appealed, arguing the petitioner failed to prove the facts alleged in his petition [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner has established proper and reasonable cause to change his name.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that a change of name may be authorized only when there is "proper and reasonable cause" therefor (Sec. 5, Rule 103, Rules of Court) [2, 3].

The petitioner failed to prove that his name actually evokes derisive laughter, as no evidence was introduced regarding the name's meaning in Visayan [2]. He also failed to prove how the name handicapped his business dealings or provide reliable evidence of his baptism as "Vicente Ty" [2, 4]. Most importantly, the petitioner admitted to using several names without legal authority during his residence in the Philippines. The Court ruled that allowing a change of name under these circumstances could cause confusion among those who knew him by different names [5]. The State has an interest in the name borne by each individual for identification purposes, and names should not be changed for trivial reasons [6].

The appealed decision is **REVERSED**, and the petition is **DISMISSED** [6].
