I. CAPTION
AFAG VETERAN CORPS, INC. v. PINEDA, G.R. No. L-17159, November 28, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On April 7, 1959, the Solicitor General filed an administrative case against Petitioner AFAG Veteran Corps, Inc. (AFAG) before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for unauthorized use of military ranks and misrepresentation [1, 2]. AFAG initially filed a petition for injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pasay to stop the SEC investigation, but it was dismissed on the ground that the CFI could not enjoin the Commission [3, 4]. On March 19, 1960, AFAG filed a similar petition for injunction in the CFI of Manila against Respondents SEC Commissioner Pineda and Investigator Mendoza [5]. The CFI Manila dismissed the petition, and AFAG appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to review the orders of the Securities and Exchange Commission or enjoin its proceedings.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the power to review decisions and orders of the Securities and Exchange Commission pertains exclusively to the Supreme Court, not the Courts of First Instance, pursuant to Section 1, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court and Section 35 of Commonwealth Act No. 83 (The Securities Act) [6]. Furthermore, even if the petition were treated as one for prohibition, the CFI lacks jurisdiction. Under Section 4, Rule 65, a CFI may only file a petition for prohibition if it relates to acts of an "inferior Court," and the SEC is not an inferior court relative to the CFI [7].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [8].
