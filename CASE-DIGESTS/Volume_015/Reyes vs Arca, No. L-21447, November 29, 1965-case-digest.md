**I. CAPTION**
**JOSE REYES, SOLEDAD REYES and CARMELITA REYES DE PASTOR v. HON. FRANCISCO ARCA, Presiding Judge, Court of First Instance of Manila (Branch I) and EUSEBIO MILLAR**, G.R. No. L-21447, November 29, 1965, J.P. Bengzon, J.

**II. FACTS**
On December 3, 1949, Spouses Feliciano and Pilar Basa leased three parcels of land in Manila to respondent Eusebio Millar for five years at P320.00 monthly. The contract granted Millar the first option to buy if the lessors decided to sell; otherwise, any third-party buyer must respect the lease. On August 28, 1953, the Basas sold the properties to petitioners (Reyeses) for P42,000.00. The petitioners respected the lease.

On March 16, 1954, Millar filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against the Basas and petitioners to annul the sale, exercise his option to buy, and recover damages. Millar initially deposited rentals with the court but later withdrew the P20,000.00 accumulated deposit in 1959 upon filing a security bond. On February 2, 1963, petitioners moved that Millar be required to deposit rentals accrued from January 1959 to December 1962 (P15,360.00) and future monthly rentals. The respondent Judge denied the motion in orders dated March 20 and April 6, 1963. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the lessee may validly suspend the payment of rentals to the purchaser of the leased property while a case regarding the sale's validity is pending.
2. W/N certiorari is the proper remedy to set aside the trial court's orders.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** Under Article 1657 of the New Civil Code, the lessee is obliged to pay the price of the lease according to the terms stipulated. Article 1658 allows the suspension of payment in only two specific instances: (1) when the lessor fails to make necessary repairs, or (2) when the lessor fails to maintain the lessee in peaceful and adequate enjoyment of the property [1]. Neither instance was present in this case. Millar continued to occupy the property, and his status as lessee was respected by the purchasers [2]. By allowing the suspension of payment without legal ground, the trial court sanctioned the unjust enjoyment of another's property, violating Article 19 of the New Civil Code (acting with justice and giving everyone his due) [3].

2. **YES.** An appeal was not a speedy and adequate remedy because it could not be taken until the case was decided on the merits, and the trial was far from finished. Therefore, certiorari under Section 1, Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court was the available and proper remedy to correct the trial court's grave abuse of discretion [4].

The petition is **GRANTED**. The orders of the trial court are set aside, and respondent Millar is ordered to deposit the accrued rentals of P16,640.00 and pay the monthly rentals thereafter [4].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, and Zaldivar concurred. Chief Justice Bengzon took no part.
