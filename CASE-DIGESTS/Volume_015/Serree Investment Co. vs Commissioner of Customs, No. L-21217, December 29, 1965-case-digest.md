I. CAPTION
SERREE INVESTMENT COMPANY v. COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-21217, December 29, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Serree Investment Company was the consignee of 3,000 crates of onions which arrived in Manila on June 26, 1954. The Collector of Customs seized the shipment for violation of Central Bank (CB) Circulars Nos. 44 and 45, as the importation lacked the necessary CB release certificate. The Collector ordered the forfeiture of the goods. Petitioner was allowed to redeem the merchandise under protest upon payment of P72,836.30. The Commissioner of Customs sustained the Collector's ruling, and the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the decision. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the Central Bank lacks the authority to regulate importations that do not require the purchase of foreign exchange.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the imported goods are subject to forfeiture under Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code for violation of Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that importations made without the necessary import license and release certificate required by Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 fall within the class of "merchandise of prohibited importation" or merchandise the importation of which is effected "contrary to law." Consequently, the Commissioner of Customs may validly seize and order them forfeited under Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code. The Court reiterated that the Central Bank has the authority to regulate such imports under Republic Act No. 265 to check the unregulated flow of foreign exchange, as every import ultimately creates a demand for foreign exchange.

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
