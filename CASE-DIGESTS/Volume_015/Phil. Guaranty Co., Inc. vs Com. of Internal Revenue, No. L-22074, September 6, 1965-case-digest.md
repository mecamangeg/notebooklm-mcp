I. CAPTION
THE PHILIPPINE GUARANTY CO., INC. v. THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-22074, September 6, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Philippine Guaranty Co., Inc. was held liable by the Supreme Court in a decision promulgated on April 30, 1965, for P375,345.00 in income taxes it failed to withhold and remit on reinsurance premiums. However, the Court did not impose a surcharge, finding that the petitioner’s failure to file was due to "reasonable cause"—specifically, reliance on the advice of auditors and a previous opinion of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR). Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that since the Court found it innocent of willful neglect or negligence (the basis for the surcharge exemption), it should effectively be absolved from paying the tax itself. Petitioner also claimed protection under Section 200 of the Income Tax Regulations, which allows agents to query the CIR regarding taxability.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the exemption from the surcharge due to "reasonable cause" also exempts the withholding agent from payment of the tax due.
2. W/N the petitioner is released from personal liability under Section 200 of the Income Tax Regulations.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Violating Section 53(c) of the Tax Code is distinct from imposing the penalty for such violation. Section 72 provides that if a failure to file a return is due to "reasonable cause," the surcharge (penalty) is not added. However, the exemption from the surcharge necessarily implies that a violation of the duty to withhold under Section 53(c) still occurred. The removal of the penalty does not carry with it the remission of the tax itself. As a withholding agent, the petitioner remains personally liable for the tax it was duty-bound to withhold.

2. **NO.** Section 200 of the Income Tax Regulations provides protection only if the agent strictly follows three steps: (1) withhold the tax; (2) promptly query the CIR; and (3) receive a decision. In this case, the petitioner failed to withhold the tax before making its inquiry. The Court emphasized that tax laws generally require that "payment precedes defense" to prevent delay in tax collection, and strict compliance is required for exemption.

Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED**.
