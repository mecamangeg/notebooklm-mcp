I. CAPTION
YU CHI HAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22040, November 29, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Yu Chi Han sought to change his name to "Alejandro Go Yu" before the Court of First Instance of Basilan City [1]. He alleged that since birth he was called "Alejandro," was known as "Alejandro Yu" in school, and was baptized as "Alejandro Go Yu" on October 29, 1961, in accordance with Catholic rites [1]. He argued the change was necessary to avoid confusion and comply with his newly acquired faith [1].

The lower court denied the petition, ruling that granting it would cause more confusion as he is known in the community by both his chosen name and his registered name, Yu Chi Han [2]. Petitioner appealed the decision to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner has shown proper and reasonable cause to justify a change of name.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, emphasizing that a change of name is a privilege, not a matter of right [3], [2]. To authorize a change, the petitioner must show proper or reasonable cause, such as: (1) the name is ridiculous, dishonorable, or difficult to pronounce; (2) a change in status (e.g., legitimation); or (3) the change is necessary to avoid confusion [4], [2].

The Court found that the petitioner failed to show any compelling reason for the change other than his desire to continue using a name he was not authorized to use [5]. Documentary evidence, including his alien certificate of registration, income tax return, and government clearances, showed his true name is Yu Chi Han [6]. The Court held that any confusion was due to the petitioner's unauthorized use of a different name, which can be remedied by asking associates to use his true name rather than seeking judicial authority to change it [6].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [7].
