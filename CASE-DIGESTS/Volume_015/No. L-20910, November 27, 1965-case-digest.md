**I. CAPTION**
**YAO LONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-20910, November 27, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Yao Long filed a petition for naturalization on October 14, 1961, with the Court of First Instance of Iloilo [1]. He did not file a declaration of intention one year prior to the petition, claiming exemption based on continuous residence in the Philippines for over 32 years (alleging arrival in 1928) and his education in government-recognized schools [2, 3]. He also claimed to be childless [2].

The Government opposed the petition, presenting evidence that Petitioner's residence was interrupted by trips to China in 1940 (10 months) and 1946 (3 months) [4, 5]. Immigration records further indicated he actually arrived in 1933, making his residence less than 30 years [5]. Furthermore, evidence showed Petitioner actually had two children born in China who were not enrolled in Philippine schools [6]. Petitioner also failed to state his former places of residence in Manila and Bacolod in his petition [7]. The trial court granted the petition, prompting the Republic to appeal [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a declaration of intention.
2. W/N the failure to state former places of residence is fatal to the petition.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** To be exempt from filing a declaration of intention, the applicant's 30-year residence must be continuous and "not punctured with interruptions of an intention not in line with the spirit of our law" [5, 8]. The discrepancies in his arrival date (1933 vs. 1928) and his trips to China impair the sufficiency of his residence requirement [5]. Furthermore, exemption requires the applicant to enroll his children in government-recognized schools in the Philippines [6, 9]. Petitioner concealed the existence of his two children born in China and failed to prove they received the required education, disqualifying him from the exemption [6].

2. **YES.** Section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 makes it mandatory to allege all former places of residence in the petition [7, 10]. Petitioner resided in Manila and Bacolod before moving to Iloilo but failed to include these addresses in his application [7]. The Court held that this requirement is essential, and failure to comply affects the jurisdiction of the court, citing *Calvin K. Lo v. Republic* [7].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** [11].
