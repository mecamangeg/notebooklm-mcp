I. CAPTION
TUASON & LEGARDA, LTD. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE and COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-18552, September 30, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tuason & Legarda, Ltd., owner of "La Rosario" distillery, received an assessment for specific taxes on stored spirits from respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) on December 16, 1958 [1, 2]. Petitioner requested authority to destroy the stock, claiming it was unfit for consumption [2]. On July 3, 1959, the CIR denied the request but reduced the assessment to P2,814.95 plus penalty; petitioner received this ruling on August 12, 1959 [3].

On August 15, 1959, petitioner reiterated its request to destroy the stock, which the CIR denied on September 30, 1959. Petitioner received this denial around "the middle of October" 1959 [3, 4]. Petitioner sent another letter reiterating its stand on November 26, 1959 [5]. Instead of replying, the CIR served a warrant of distraint and levy on January 20, 1960 [5]. Petitioner filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) on February 11, 1960 [6]. The CTA dismissed the petition for being filed beyond the 30-day reglementary period under Republic Act No. 1125 [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for review was filed within the 30-day prescriptive period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's dismissal, ruling that the assessment had become final, executory, and incontrovertible [8]. The CIR's letter dated July 3, 1959 was the appealable decision, and the 30-day period began when petitioner received it on August 12, 1959 [4]. Petitioner consumed three days before filing a reconsideration on August 15, 1959 [4]. When petitioner received the denial of this reconsideration in mid-October 1959, the period resumed running [4, 8].

From mid-October 1959 until the filing of the petition on February 11, 1960, more than three months elapsed, far exceeding the remaining balance of the 30-day period [8]. The Court held that the subsequent letter of November 26, 1959 did not suspend the running of the period because it was a "mere reiteration" of two previous petitions already denied by the respondent [8]. Even assuming the denial was received as late as November 20, 1959, the petition was still filed out of time as more than 60 days had elapsed by February 11, 1960 [9].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [10].
