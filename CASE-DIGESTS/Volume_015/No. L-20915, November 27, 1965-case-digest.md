I. CAPTION
TEOFILO LU alias CANA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20915, November 27, 1965.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Teofilo Lu alias Cana filed a petition for naturalization, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Cebu. The Republic appealed the decision. The evidence showed discrepancies in the petitioner's documents: (1) In his marriage contract (Exhibit O), he falsely stated that his deceased father, Lu Yu, was Filipino (when he was Chinese) and that his mother was "Tan Hoa Eng" (a Filipina), contradicting his testimony that his mother was "Cirila Rivera" and ignoring the fact that she was actually Chinese; (2) He claimed to be Filipino in Exhibit O and his 1962 Residence Certificate, despite being registered as a Chinese citizen with the Chinese Embassy and the Bureau of Immigration; and (3) He failed to register himself and his daughter under the Alien Registration Act.

Regarding his character witnesses, the petitioner presented Dr. Filoteo and Candido Tabada. Dr. Filoteo was the retained physician of Lu Do & Lu Ym Corporation, a company belonging to the petitioner's family. Both witnesses were considered "professional witnesses," having testified in naturalization cases seven and five times, respectively. Dr. Filoteo admitted he did not know if the petitioner possessed specific disqualifications (e.g., regarding organized government or polygamy) and merely "presumed" the petitioner's belief in Constitutional principles because he had attended school.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner possesses the good moral character and proper conduct required for naturalization.
2. W/N the character witnesses presented were credible and competent.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petitioner lacks the third qualification prescribed in Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 regarding good moral character and proper and irreproachable conduct [1, 2]. The Court found that he made false statements in public documents, specifically his marriage contract and residence certificate, regarding his and his parents' citizenship [3]. Furthermore, he failed to comply with the legal requirement of registering himself and his daughter under the Alien Registration Act [3].

2. **NO.** The petitioner failed to establish his qualifications with the testimony of at least two "credible persons" as required by the Naturalization Law [4]. The Court held that the witnesses were not credible because: (a) One witness (Dr. Filoteo) was an employee of the petitioner's family corporation, which diminished the weight of his testimony [5, 6]; (b) Both were "professional witnesses" who had testified in numerous naturalization cases [6]; and (c) They did not possess actual knowledge of the petitioner's qualifications, admitting they merely "presumed" his beliefs and did not know if he possessed statutory disqualifications [6-8].

**Disposition:** Decision reversed [4].
