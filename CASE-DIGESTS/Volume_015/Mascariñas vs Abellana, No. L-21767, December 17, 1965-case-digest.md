**I. CAPTION**
RAFAEL P. MASCARIÑAS v. MONEBRIO F. ABELLANA, G.R. No. L-21767, December 17, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Abellana was appointed and confirmed as Chief of Police of Davao City in 1955 [1]. In 1957, Petitioner Mascariñas was designated as "Acting Chief of Police" [2]. Shortly thereafter, Abellana was called to active military duty by the AFP and placed on detached service with the Office of the President [2]. Abellana wired the City Mayor that Mascariñas could assume the post while he was on active duty [2]. While Abellana was serving in the military, Mascariñas was nominated and confirmed as Chief of Police in May 1958 [3].

In 1959, Abellana filed a *quo warranto* suit (Civil Case No. 3040) against Mascariñas, but it was dismissed for lack of cause of action as he was still on active duty [3]. Upon reverting to inactive status in April 1962, Abellana sought to reassume his civilian office [4]. Mascariñas then filed the present petition for *quo warranto*, arguing that Abellana had forfeited his right to the office due to his five-year military service and acceptance of an incompatible office, and that his claim was barred by the dismissal of his previous suit [5]. The Court of First Instance of Davao dismissed the petition and ruled in favor of Abellana [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N Abellana forfeited his position as Chief of Police due to his absence while on an extended tour of active military duty.
2. W/N Abellana is barred from claiming the office by *res judicata* due to the dismissal of his 1959 *quo warranto* suit.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that Abellana did not forfeit his position. Under Section 49 of Commonwealth Act No. 1 (National Defense Act), as amended by C.A. No. 569, any government employee called for an "extended tour of active duty" shall not lose his position or suffer a loss of pay due to his absence in fulfillment of military obligations [6, 7]. Consequently, Abellana’s absence did not create a vacancy, rendering Mascariñas' subsequent nomination and confirmation null and void *ab initio* [8, 9]. Furthermore, Abellana’s service in the Office of the Executive Secretary was in obedience to military assignment and did not constitute holding an incompatible office [8].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that *res judicata* does not apply. The dismissal of Abellana’s 1959 suit was due to a lack of cause of action at that specific time, as he was still in active military service and could not validly discharge the duties of the civilian office [10]. However, once he reverted to inactive status in 1962, the conflicting obligations ceased, and his right to occupy the office fully accrued [10].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed [11].
