I. CAPTION
RURAL BANK OF LUCENA, INC. v. HON. FRANCISCO ARCA and CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21146, September 20, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
The Monetary Board of the Central Bank (CB) issued Resolution No. 928 threatening to take over the management of petitioner Rural Bank of Lucena (Lucena Bank) for alleged violations. Lucena Bank filed a suit (Civil Case No. 47345) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, resulting in a decision by Judge Gatmaitan enjoining the enforcement of said resolution due to lack of a prior hearing required by Section 10 of the Rural Banks Act (R.A. No. 720) [1, 2].

While that case was pending, the Monetary Board issued a subsequent Resolution (No. 122) finding Lucena Bank insolvent and ordering its liquidation under Section 29 of the Central Bank Act (R.A. No. 265). Lucena Bank attempted to annul this resolution in the CFI of Quezon but failed to maintain an injunction [1-3]. Subsequently, the CB filed a petition in the CFI of Manila (Civil Case No. 50019) for assistance in liquidation. Respondent Judge Arca issued an order requiring Lucena Bank to surrender its assets and papers to the CB [4]. Lucena Bank filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that R.A. No. 265 does not apply to rural banks, that the closure lacked a prior hearing, and that the order interfered with Judge Gatmaitan's earlier decision [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Section 29 of the Central Bank Act (R.A. No. 265) applies to rural banks organized under R.A. No. 720.
2. W/N a prior hearing is required before the Monetary Board can order the liquidation of a bank under Section 29 of R.A. No. 265.
3. W/N the liquidation order interfered with the previous court decision regarding management takeover.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 27 of the Rural Banks Act expressly makes the provisions of the Central Bank Act applicable to rural banks whenever not in conflict. The Court held there is no irreconcilable conflict between Section 10 of R.A. No. 720 (authorizing management takeover to ensure compliance) and Section 29 of R.A. No. 265 (authorizing liquidation in cases of insolvency). The latter is a distinct, more drastic remedy for when a bank cannot resume business with safety [6-8].

2. **NO.** Unlike Section 10 of the Rural Banks Act, Section 29 of the Central Bank Act does not require a hearing prior to the Monetary Board's action. The determination of whether a bank's continuance involves probable loss to depositors is entrusted to the Monetary Board's judgment. Due process is satisfied by the statute's provision for *subsequent* judicial review within 10 days, as a prior hearing would delay action and increase danger to creditors [9-11].

3. **NO.** The two cases involved different issues and resolutions. Judge Gatmaitan's decision concerned the validity of a management takeover under Section 10 (Resolution No. 928), whereas Judge Arca's order concerned liquidation under Section 29 (Resolution No. 122). Furthermore, a decision rendered in a case filed in 1961 could not constitute a judicial review of a Monetary Board resolution adopted months later in 1962 [12, 13].

The writ was denied [14].
