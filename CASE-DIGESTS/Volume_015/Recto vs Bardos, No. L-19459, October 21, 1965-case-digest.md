I. CAPTION
ARTEMIO RECTO v. BRIGIDA A. BARDOS and THE HONORABLE SECRETARY OF PUBLIC WORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS, G.R. No. L-19459, October 21, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On February 26, 1958, respondent Bardos filed a complaint with the Bureau of Public Works charging petitioner Recto with obstructing a public creek. On August 26, 1958, the Undersecretary of Public Works ordered Recto to remove the obstruction within 30 days. Recto received the decision on October 25, 1958, and filed a petition for review and reconsideration on November 20, 1958. The Secretary denied the petition on February 27, 1959, and Recto received the denial on April 13, 1959. On April 16, 1959, Recto filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon to appeal the decision.

The CFI dismissed the complaint on the ground that the action was filed after the lapse of 30 days from notice of the decision. The lower court relied on *Enriquez v. People* and Section 25-A of Act 2152 (Irrigation Law), ruling that a motion for reconsideration does not suspend the running of the period for removal of the obstruction.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the filing of a motion for reconsideration suspends the 30-day period to appeal the decision of the Secretary of Public Works.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that Section 4 of Act 2152 does not prevent an aggrieved party from moving for reconsideration of the Secretary's decision. Such a motion is standard procedure, especially where exhaustion of administrative remedies is required before resorting to judicial action. Therefore, it is logical that when a motion for reconsideration is filed, the period for appeal is deemed suspended [1, 2].

The Court distinguished this case from *Enriquez v. People*. The extension contemplated in Section 25-A of Act 2152 refers to the period for the *physical removal* of the construction pursuant to a final and executory decision, not the period for appealing the validity of the decision itself [3-5]. Since the period was suspended during the pendency of the motion for reconsideration, Recto's appeal to the CFI was filed on time.

The Order appealed from is set aside and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.
