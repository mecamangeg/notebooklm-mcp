I. CAPTION
PETRA T. ALMENDRA and TOMAS ALMENDRA v. ELEODORO G. ALVERO, G.R. No. L-19820, September 20, 1965, 15 SCRA 63, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On July 1, 1959, respondent Eleodoro G. Alvero filed two criminal charges against petitioner Petra T. Almendra and her niece in the Justice of the Peace Court of Abuyog, Leyte: one for altering boundaries and another for malicious mischief [1]. The charges arose after Petra cut the posts of Alvero’s fence, moved the fence bodily, and attached it to new posts she had planted eight meters away from the original site [2]. The Justice of the Peace Court dismissed both criminal cases, finding that the element of malice was lacking as Petra had merely moved the fence [3]. Subsequently, Petra and her husband Tomas filed a civil complaint for malicious prosecution against Alvero in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal [4]. They also alleged that during Petra's arrest, Alvero shouted slanderous words at her [5]. The CFI dismissed the complaint for insufficiency to state a cause of action, prompting this appeal [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the complaint states a cause of action for malicious prosecution.
2. W/N the alleged slanderous words constitute a separate cause of action.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the complaint failed to establish the essential element of malice because the facts showed probable cause [2]. Alvero was the owner of the fence, and Petra admitted to cutting its posts and moving it to a different location. These circumstances were sufficient to excite the belief in a reasonable mind that Petra was guilty of the crimes of malicious mischief and altering boundaries [2]. The existence of probable cause eliminates the element of malice essential in making out a case of malicious prosecution, as established in *Buchanan v. Vda. de Esteban* [2, 6].

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the slanderous words allegedly uttered by Alvero during the arrest were merely incidental to the supposed malicious prosecution [5]. The petitioners did not claim damages specifically for the slander in their complaint, nor did they treat it as a distinct cause of action in their arguments [5]. Thus, these allegations could not justify further proceedings independent of the insufficient malicious prosecution claim [5, 7].

The Order of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [8].
