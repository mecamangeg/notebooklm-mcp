I. CAPTION
OPERATORS, INCORPORATED v. THE DIRECTOR OF PATENTS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17901, October 29, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Operators, Inc. applied to the Philippine Patent Office to register "AMBISCO" as a trademark for its candy products, which it had been using since 1956 under contracts with American Biscuit Co. Respondent National Biscuit Company opposed the application, citing its own trademark "NABISCO" registered in the Philippines since 1930 for bakery goods like biscuits and crackers.

The Director of Patents denied the application, ruling that the marks were confusingly similar. During the proceedings, certification of contracts between Operators, Inc. and American Biscuit Co. revealed that Operators, Inc. was merely authorized to operate the candy business of American Biscuit Co. and agreed that all trademarks on labels would remain the property of the latter. Petitioner appealed, arguing, among other things, that the issue of ownership was not raised by the respondent in the opposition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has the right to register the trademark "AMBISCO".
2. W/N the trademark "AMBISCO" is confusingly similar to "NABISCO".

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The right to register trademarks is based on ownership. Under Section 2 of Republic Act No. 166, only owners of trademarks may register them [1]. The evidence (contracts) conclusively showed that the trademark "AMBISCO" was owned by American Biscuit Co., not the petitioner Operators, Inc. [2]. The Court further held that an application for registration is not an ordinary litigious controversy; since public interest is involved, the Patent Office or the Court may consider questions essential to satisfying the law (such as ownership) even if not specifically raised by the parties [3, 4].

2. **YES.** The Court applied the **test of dominancy**, ruling that "AMBISCO" and "NABISCO" are confusingly similar in appearance and sound [5, 6]. Given the similarity of the products and the fact that "NABISCO" had been used in commerce in the Philippines for over 55 years prior to the petitioner's adoption of "AMBISCO," confusion among purchasers is likely [5]. Exact imitation is not necessary for infringement; it is enough if the dominant characteristics of the mark are appropriated, as the average buyer retains only a general impression [7, 8].

The decision of the Director of Patents is **AFFIRMED**.
