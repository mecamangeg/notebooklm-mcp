**I. CAPTION**
THE EDWARD J. NELL COMPANY v. PACIFIC FARMS, INC., G.R. No. L-20850, November 29, 1965, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
On October 9, 1958, petitioner Edward J. Nell Co. (Nell Co.) secured a judgment against Insular Farms, Inc. for P1,853.80 representing the unpaid balance of a pump sold to the latter. The writ of execution was returned unsatisfied as Insular Farms had no leviable property [1]. Consequently, on November 13, 1959, Nell Co. filed a suit against respondent Pacific Farms, Inc., seeking to collect the judgment on the theory that Pacific Farms was the *alter ego* of Insular Farms [1].

Records showed that on March 21, 1958, Pacific Farms purchased 1,000 shares of Insular Farms stock for P285,126.99 as the highest bidder at a bank auction [2, 3]. Pacific Farms then sold these shares to individuals who reorganized Insular Farms. The reorganized board subsequently sold Insular Farms' assets to Pacific Farms for P10,000.00 [2]. The Municipal Court, Court of First Instance, and Court of Appeals all dismissed Nell Co.’s complaint [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Pacific Farms is liable for the unpaid judgment debt of Insular Farms based on the sale of assets.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** Generally, where one corporation sells or otherwise transfers all of its assets to another corporation, the latter is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the transferor [4].

Citing *Fletcher Cyclopedia Corporations*, the Court held that a transferee is liable only under four exceptions: (1) where the purchaser expressly or impliedly agrees to assume such debts; (2) where the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger of the corporations; (3) where the purchasing corporation is merely a continuation of the selling corporation; and (4) where the transaction is entered into fraudulently in order to escape liability for such debts [4].

None of these exceptions apply. There was no agreement to assume debts [3]. The *alter ego* theory advanced by Nell Co. actually negates a merger or consolidation, as a corporation cannot be its own *alter ego* [5]. Finally, there was no fraud; the stock purchase occurred at a public bank auction prior to the judgment against Insular Farms, and the subsequent asset sale for P10,000.00 was approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, creating a presumption of fairness [3, 6].

The decision appealed from is hereby affirmed [7].
