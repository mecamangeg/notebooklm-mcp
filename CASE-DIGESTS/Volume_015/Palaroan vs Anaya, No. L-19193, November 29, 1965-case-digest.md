I. CAPTION
FERNANDO O. PALAROAN v. AURORA A. ANAYA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19193, November 29, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On January 7, 1954, Fernando Palaroan filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to annul his marriage to Aurora Anaya, claiming his consent was obtained through force and intimidation. The case was remanded to the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court (JDRC). On September 23, 1959, the JDRC dismissed the complaint and ordered Palaroan to pay Anaya monthly support and arrears. Palaroan did not appeal, and the decision became final.

In 1961, Anaya filed a motion for execution, which the JDRC granted over Palaroan's opposition regarding lack of due notice. Instead of appealing the execution order, Palaroan filed a new complaint with the CFI of Manila to annul the JDRC decision, alleging it was void and obtained through fraud. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that it could not annul the actuations of a coordinate branch. Palaroan appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Palaroan has a valid cause of action to annul the final decision of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court based on the alleged fraud.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. The Court held that Palaroan had no cause of action for the annulment of the JDRC decision. His proper remedy was to appeal the original decision of September 23, 1959, or the subsequent order granting the writ of execution, which he failed to do.

Furthermore, the Court distinguished between types of fraud. The fraud relied upon by Palaroan—that his consent to the marriage was not voluntary—is not **extrinsic fraud** (which prevents a party from having a trial or presenting their case) that would justify annulling a judgment. Rather, it was the very fraud alleged as the ground for the annulment of the marriage in the original case. Having failed to appeal the dismissal of his original complaint, he is barred from relitigating the issue. The lower court's order is affirmed.
