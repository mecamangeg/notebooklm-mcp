I. CAPTION
GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM v. HON. ANDRES REYES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-24574, December 29, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
V.V. Dionisio Construction Co., Inc. obtained a favorable partial judgment from the Court of First Instance of Rizal against petitioner Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) regarding the reformation of a construction contract [1, 2]. Within the reglementary period to appeal, GSIS filed a notice of appeal and record on appeal [3]. For the required P120.00 appeal bond, GSIS tendered a GSIS PNB check that was stamped "non-negotiable" and postdated to May 19, 1965 [3, 4]. The cashier refused to accept the check. GSIS subsequently sent the check by registered mail on the last day of the appeal period and paid the bond in cash the following day, April 27, 1965 [3, 5]. The trial court dismissed the appeal for being filed out of time [5]. GSIS filed this petition claiming the cashier acted arbitrarily in refusing the check [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the tender of a postdated, non-negotiable check constitutes valid payment of the appeal bond within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Rules of Court specify that an appeal bond shall be either in cash or in the form of a bond approved by the court; a check cannot take the place of either [7]. Furthermore, under Article 1249 of the New Civil Code, a check produces the effect of payment only when it is actually cashed [4]. In this case, the check was not only stamped "non-negotiable" but was also postdated, meaning it could not produce the effect of payment on the date it was tendered [4]. Because the valid cash payment was made only after the expiration of the reglementary period, the appeal was not perfected on time [4, 5].

Petition denied [8].
