**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF GAN TSITUNG TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. GAN TSITUNG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20819, November 29, 1965, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
On November 14, 1953, Gan Tsitung filed a petition for naturalization. The Court of First Instance of Manila granted the petition on December 24, 1954. On December 26, 1956, Gan Tsitung took his oath of allegiance, and a certificate of naturalization was issued to him [1].

On May 10, 1962, the Solicitor General filed a petition to annul the decision and cancel the certificate of naturalization [1]. The Solicitor General argued that the notice of the filing of the petition and the hearing was published in the *Official Gazette* only once, violating Section 9 of the Revised Naturalization Law, which requires publication once a week for three consecutive weeks [1, 2]. The lower court granted the relief sought by the Solicitor General. Gan Tsitung appealed, arguing that the defect should not retroactively affect the final decision rendered in his favor [2, 3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the failure to publish the notice of the petition and hearing once a week for three consecutive weeks in the *Official Gazette* renders the decision granting naturalization null and void for lack of jurisdiction.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** Non-compliance with Section 9 of the Revised Naturalization Act regarding publication is a fatal defect that impairs the very root or foundation of the court's authority to decide the case [4, 5].

The Supreme Court, citing *Ong Son Cui v. Republic*, held that a single publication is incomplete and insufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the lower court to try the case and grant the petition [2]. Because the lower court had no jurisdiction to hear the petition due to this defect, the decision rendered therein is null and void [3, 6]. Consequently, the oath of allegiance taken and the certificate of naturalization issued pursuant to that void decision are also null and void [3, 7].

The Order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [8].
