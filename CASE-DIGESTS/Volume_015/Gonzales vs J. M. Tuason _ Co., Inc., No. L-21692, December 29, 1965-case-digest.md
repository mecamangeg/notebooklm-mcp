I. CAPTION
ROMAN GONZALES, ET AL. v. J. M. TUASON & CO., INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-21692, December 29, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On April 28, 1960, Roman Gonzales and others (plaintiffs-appellants) filed a complaint against J. M. Tuason & Co., Inc. to compel the latter to execute a deed of sale over a parcel of land in Quezon City and to declare ineffective the writ of execution issued in Civil Case No. Q-4559. Plaintiffs claimed they were entitled to the land based on a preferential right granted under a Compromise Agreement dated March 16, 1953 [1, 2].

J. M. Tuason & Co., Inc. filed an answer raising the defense of *res judicata*, arguing that the issues regarding ownership and possession were already settled by the judgment in the prior Civil Case No. Q-4559 (*J. M. Tuason & Co., Inc. v. Roman Gonzales*). The Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissed the complaint, finding the cause of action barred by the prior judgment. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs' action to enforce a preferential right to purchase is barred by *res judicata* due to their failure to raise it in the previous case.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the action is barred. The Court reasoned that the preferential right the appellants sought to enforce—based on the Deudor-Tuason compromise agreement—was in the nature of a **compulsory counterclaim** [2].

Since this claim was necessarily connected with the right of possession asserted by Tuason in the previous case (Civil Case No. Q-4559), appellants should have raised it therein. Having failed to set up said right as a counterclaim in the previous litigation, they are deemed to have waived it and are now barred from asserting the same under the principle of *res judicata* [2, 5]. Citing *J. M. Tuason & Co., Inc. v. Sanvictores*, the Court emphasized that under the Rules of Court (specifically Section 6 of Rule 10 and Section 10 of Rule 9), the failure to set up such rights results in a waiver thereof [6].

The order appealed from is affirmed [7].
