**I. CAPTION**
DIOSDADO STA. ROMANA v. CARLOS IMPERIO, HEIRS OF PABLO IGNACIO, et al., G.R. No. L-17280, December 29, 1965, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
On January 6, 1946, Silvio Viola (Principal) authorized his brother, Dr. Jose Viola (Agent), to manage and sell parcels of land in Bulacan [1]. On June 18, 1946, the Agent sold six lots to Pablo Ignacio. This sale was annotated on the title on July 2, 1946 [2]. However, on October 18, 1946, the Principal sold the same land to petitioner Diosdado Sta. Romana, who in turn sold it to respondent Carlos Imperio on October 25, 1946 [2]. Imperio subsequently sold portions of the land to various occupants [2, 3]. Ignacio filed an action to annul the sales to Sta. Romana and Imperio [3].

The trial court declared Ignacio the lawful owner and ordered Imperio to refund the occupants the value of the lots sold [4, 5]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision but amended it to order Sta. Romana to reimburse Imperio the sum of P8,463.00, representing the amount Imperio had to refund to the occupants [6]. Sta. Romana appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that Imperio is not entitled to reimbursement because they were in *pari delicto* [6, 7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner is liable to reimburse the respondent for the value of the land upon eviction despite the defense of *pari delicto*.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner is liable to reimburse the respondent. The Court rejected the application of the *pari delicto* rule under Article 1412 of the Civil Code, explaining that this provision applies only to contracts that are null and void *ab initio* [8]. The contract of sale between Sta. Romana and Imperio was a valid contract, subject to the rules on double sales under Article 1544, but resulted in a breach of warranty against eviction [8].

Under Articles 1495, 1547, and 1555 of the Civil Code, a vendor warrants his title to the thing sold. In the event of eviction, the vendee is entitled to the return of the value of the thing sold at the time of eviction [7]. Since Imperio was evicted from the property due to Ignacio's superior title, Sta. Romana must reimburse him the value of the land, which was established to be P8,463.00 [7].

The amended decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [9].
