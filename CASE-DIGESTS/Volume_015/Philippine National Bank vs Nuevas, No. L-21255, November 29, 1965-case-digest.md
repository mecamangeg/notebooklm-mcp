I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. JAIME R. NUEVAS, G.R. No. L-21255, November 29, 1965, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
On April 12, 1948, Jaime R. Nuevas, Maximo de la Cruz, and Edmundo S. Adriano executed a promissory note for P1,500.00 in favor of Philippine National Bank (PNB) [1]. When the note was not paid at maturity, PNB filed a collection suit in the Municipal Court of Manila in 1950 [1]. The court rendered judgment against the three defendants "jointly and severally" for P1,668.00 plus interest and fees [2]. This judgment became final but was not satisfied by execution within five years [2].

On March 4, 1960, PNB filed an action in the same Municipal Court to revive the judgment against the same defendants [2]. The court rendered judgment reviving the obligation against Nuevas only, dismissing the suit against the other two "without prejudice" as they could not be served summons [3]. Nuevas appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI), arguing that the trial could not proceed without his co-defendants [3]. After the Court of Appeals dismissed his petition for certiorari regarding the lower court's power to proceed against him alone, the CFI ruled in favor of PNB, ordering Nuevas to pay P2,738.51 [4]. Nuevas appealed directly to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a judgment rendered against several defendants jointly and severally can be revived against one of them only.

IV. RULING
**YES.** A judgment rendered against several defendants, jointly and severally, constitutes a solidary obligation [5]. Under Article 1216 of the New Civil Code, a creditor "may proceed against any one of the solidary debtors or some or all of them simultaneously" [5].

The Court held that a suit for the revival of a judgment is a new action having the original judgment as its cause of action [6]. Since the original judgment imposed a solidary liability, the new action to enforce it may proceed against any one of the solidary debtors, consistent with the rules on solidary obligations [6]. Consequently, the revival suit was validly brought against Nuevas alone.

The judgment appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [7].
