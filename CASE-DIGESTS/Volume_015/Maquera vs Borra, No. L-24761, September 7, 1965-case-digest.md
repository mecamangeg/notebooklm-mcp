I. CAPTION
LEON G. MAQUERA v. JUAN BORRA, et al., G.R. No. L-24761, September 7, 1965, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
Congress enacted Republic Act No. 4421, which required all candidates for national, provincial, city, and municipal offices to post a surety bond equivalent to the one-year salary or emoluments of the position sought [1]. Under the law, this bond would be forfeited to the government if the candidate failed to obtain at least 10% of the votes cast, unless they were declared the winner [1]. Implementing this Act, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) required candidates for President, Vice-President, and Congress to file surety bonds ranging from P32,000.00 to P60,000.00 [2]. Petitioner Maquera challenged the constitutionality of the Act, arguing that it imposes property qualifications that are inconsistent with the Republican system and the principle of social justice mandated by the Constitution [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Republic Act No. 4421 is unconstitutional.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Republic Act No. 4421 is unconstitutional. The Court held that the Act effectively imposes property qualifications for running for public office, which are inconsistent with the nature and essence of the Republican system ordained in the Constitution and the principle of social justice [4], [3]. The Republican system is premised on the tenet that sovereignty resides in the people, which implies that the right to vote and be voted for shall not be dependent upon the wealth of the individual [3]. Furthermore, social justice presupposes equal opportunity for all, ensuring that no person is denied the chance to be elected due to poverty [3]. The Court also noted that the bond requirement and its confiscation were arbitrary and oppressive, as they were not predicated on the necessity of defraying election expenses [5].

The Court declared Republic Act No. 4421 null and void and enjoined the respondents from enforcing it [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Bengzon, J.P., J.** (Concurring): The Act violates the Constitution by adding a property qualification not found in the organic requirements for candidates (age, citizenship, residence) [6]. While Congress may regulate elections, a bond equivalent to a full year's salary acts as a substantial barrier that disqualifies honest but poor candidates, while failing to stop wealthy "nuisance" candidates [7], [8]. It also violates equal protection by imposing a financial penalty on candidates who lose by a certain margin [9].
