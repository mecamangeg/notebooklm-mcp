I. CAPTION
SALIH UTUTALUM v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS and INDANAN ANNI, G.R. No. L-25349, December 3, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
During the November 9, 1965 national elections for the lone congressional district of Sulu, voting in several precincts in Tapul and Siasi was disrupted. In Tapul, no election was held due to terrorism and gunfire. In Siasi, voting was suspended around noon for similar reasons. Petitioner Salih Ututalum was leading the count against Respondent Indanan Anni in the remaining precincts.

On November 20, 1965, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) issued a resolution ordering that elections be held in the affected Tapul precincts and continued in the Siasi precincts on December 7, 1965. Ututalum filed a petition to annul this resolution, arguing that the COMELEC had no authority to order elections on a date different from that fixed by law. The Respondents argued the resolution was justified under the COMELEC’s constitutional power to ensure free, orderly, and honest elections (Art. X, Sec. 2).

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Commission on Elections has the power to order the holding or continuation of elections on a date subsequent to that fixed by law.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The functions of the COMELEC are essentially executive and administrative. The power to fix the date of elections is **legislative** in character. The Constitution provides that elections shall be held on dates "fixed by law" (Art. VI, Sec. 8[1]; Art. VII, Sec. 4), meaning an Act of Congress. There is no statutory grant authorizing the COMELEC to fix election dates.

Under **Section 8 of the Revised Election Code**, the power to postpone an election due to serious causes is vested exclusively in the **President**, upon recommendation of the COMELEC. Furthermore, this power must be exercised *before* the election or on the date thereof, not days later. Regarding the "continuation" of voting in Siasi, the Court held that while voting may be extended beyond closing time on election day to accommodate voters present (Luna v. Rodriguez), a "continuation" scheduled nearly a month later breaks the necessary "solution of continuity." To allow voting on a much later date, when results in other precincts are already known, would impair the objective of ascertaining the collective will of the electorate as of the original election date.

The resolution of the Commission on Elections is hereby **ANNULLED** and the Commission is restrained from holding the elections directed therein.
