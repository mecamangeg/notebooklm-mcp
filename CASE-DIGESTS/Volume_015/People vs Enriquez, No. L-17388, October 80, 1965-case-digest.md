I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CATALINO ENRIQUEZ and BENIGNO ALCANTARA, G.R. No. L-17388, October 30, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of December 12, 1957, in Malangas, Zamboanga del Sur, Siaba (alias Yu Siap) and his two housemaids were killed during a robbery where P666.10 in cash and goods were taken. Prosecution witness Ramon Mambi testified that earlier that day, appellant Enriquez was denied credit by Siaba and left muttering threats. Later, Mambi saw Enriquez attacking Siaba with a bolo, followed by appellant Alcantara (Enriquez's brother) who pursued and hacked the victim. While being carried to a boat for medical treatment, the dying Siaba confided to witnesses, including Nia Laya, that Alcantara was the one who wounded him. The appellants claimed alibi and attributed the crime to a band of Muslims. The Court of First Instance convicted them of robbery with triple homicide and sentenced them to life imprisonment.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the guilt and identity of the appellants were proven beyond reasonable doubt.
2. W/N the crime of robbery was sufficiently established.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the testimony of prosecution witness Ramon Mambi was plain, simple, and straightforward. Mambi had no motive to falsely incriminate the appellants, who were his first cousins [1]. His version was corroborated by the *ante-mortem* declaration of the victim Siaba to Nia Laya, identifying Alcantara as the assailant [1]. The defense witness's claim that a band ransacked the store was contradicted by the physical evidence, as the victim's wife found no such disorder, only a forced open trunk [2].

2. **YES.** The robbery was proven by the testimony of the deceased's wife, who established that a trunk had been forced open and money and goods worth P666.10 were missing [3]. The Court noted that the maids would not have been killed were the motive not theft [3]. Following established jurisprudence (*People v. Manuel*, etc.), only one penalty is imposed for robbery with homicide regardless of the number of killings [4]. The decision was **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**, increasing the indemnity to P6,000 for each victim and fixing restitution at P666.10 [4], [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
