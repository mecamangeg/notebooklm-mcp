I. CAPTION
CANDIDO UY alias RICARDO UY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22712, November 29, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Candido Uy, a naturalized Filipino citizen since 1959, filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga to change his surname from "Uy" to "Baluyot." He argued that "Uy" is a distinctively Chinese surname, causing him to be frequently mistaken for a Chinese citizen. This confusion resulted in embarrassment, hampered his social life (such as entering civic organizations like the Lions Club), and caused delays in his business dealings, particularly with government agencies, where he constantly had to explain his citizenship [1-3]. He chose the surname "Baluyot" to honor former Secretary Sotero Baluyot, a close family friend and his father's godfather, who gave written consent to the adoption of the name [4].

The Republic opposed the petition, arguing that Uy failed to show sufficient prejudice caused by the continued use of his present name [4, 5]. The trial court granted the petition. The Republic appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved only questions of law [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner showed proper and reasonable cause to change his name under Rule 103 of the Rules of Court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision. The Court held that the determination of "proper and reasonable cause" in a change of name petition is left to the sound discretion of the court (*Yu v. Republic*; *Ong v. Republic*) [5]. The evidence need only be satisfactory to the court, not necessarily the best evidence available (*Ching v. Republic*) [5].

The Court found that the petitioner had a sincere desire to erase signs of his former Chinese nationality to be fully recognized as a Filipino. This desire aligns with the policy of naturalization laws, which encourage applicants to fully embrace Filipino customs and traditions [2]. The Court established the doctrine that in the absence of prejudice to the State or any individual, a sincere desire to adopt a Filipino name to erase signs of a former alien nationality which unduly hamper social and business life constitutes a "proper and reasonable cause." It is not trivial, whimsical, or capricious [3]. No fraudulent intent or attempt to evade liability was shown in this case [3].

Judgment affirmed [6].
