I. CAPTION
ALEX LO KIONG v. UNITED STATES LINES COMPANY, MANILA PORT SERVICE, and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-18673, November 29, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Alex Lo Kiong, doing business as Luzon Rattan Industries, imported three bales of goods via the SS "Pioneer Mill," operated by United States Lines. The goods were discharged into the custody of the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service (MPS), a subsidiary of Manila Railroad Company. Lo Kiong's broker, Falcon Brokerage, paid duties and arrastre charges based on the cubic measurement of the cargo (P7.72), not the declared value. The delivery permit issued was stamped with a provision subjecting it to the Management Contract between MPS and the Bureau of Customs, which limits MPS's liability to P500.00 per package unless the value is declared and corresponding charges paid [1, 2].

None of the three bales were delivered to Lo Kiong. He filed a claim for the full value (P3,890.68) and subsequently sued United States Lines, MPS, and Manila Railroad Company. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint against United States Lines but ordered MPS and Manila Railroad to pay the full value plus attorney's fees [3]. MPS and Manila Railroad appealed, invoking the limited liability clause of the Management Contract [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the consignee is bound by the Management Contract provision limiting the arrastre operator's liability to P500 per package despite not being a signatory.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the consignee is bound by the Management Contract. Although Lo Kiong was not a signatory, he became a party to the contract when his broker obtained a delivery permit and demanded delivery of the goods pursuant to said contract [5]. The Court applied the doctrine in *Northern Motors, Inc. v. Prince Lines*, ruling that the use of the delivery permit and the filing of a suit based on the arrastre operator's obligations under the Management Contract bind the consignee to its terms [5].

Under the contract, full value can only be recovered if the consignee declares the value of the goods in the manifest or bill of lading and pays arrastre charges based on that value. Since Lo Kiong paid charges based only on cubic measurement and not the declared value, the limited liability clause applies [6].

The decision of the lower court was **MODIFIED**. The liability of the appellants was reduced to P500.00 for each of the three bales (total of P1,500.00), and the award for attorney's fees and costs was eliminated [7].
