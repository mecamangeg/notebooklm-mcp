I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE STEAM NAVIGATION CO. v. PHILIPPINE MARINE OFFICERS GUILD, et al., G.R. Nos. L-20667 & L-20669, October 29, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Philippine Steam Navigation Co. (PHILSTEAM) received a set of demands for collective bargaining from respondent Philippine Marine Officers Guild (PMOG) on June 18, 1954. On June 29, 1954, PHILSTEAM required PMOG to prove its majority representation and simultaneously started interrogating its captains and officers regarding their union affiliation and authority given to PMOG. PMOG subsequently refused to submit proof of majority status before its demands were considered and filed a notice of strike alleging unfair labor practices (ULP). PHILSTEAM later recognized and signed a collective bargaining agreement with a competing union, Cebu Seamen's Association (CSA). PMOG declared a strike on August 24, 1954. The dispute was certified to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). The CIR found PHILSTEAM guilty of ULP for interfering with the employees' right to self-organization through interrogation and vilification of PMOG, declared the strike legal, and ordered the reinstatement of strikers without backwages. PHILSTEAM appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N PHILSTEAM committed unfair labor practice by interrogating its employees regarding their union affiliation.
2. W/N the striking employees are entitled to reinstatement despite the hiring of replacements.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** PHILSTEAM committed unfair labor practice. The Court held that while an employer is not denied the privilege of interrogating employees for a legitimate purpose, the subjection of employees to a series of questioning regarding their union membership or activities in a way that hampers their free choice constitutes unfair labor practice (*Scoty's Department Store v. Micaller*). Here, the interrogation commenced even before PMOG refused to prove its majority representation, and supervisory officials also vilified PMOG while soliciting membership for the competing union CSA. These acts interfered with, restrained, and coerced employees in the exercise of their right to self-organization under Section 4(a)(1) of Republic Act 875.

2. **YES.** The striking employees are entitled to reinstatement. The Court applied the rule that if a strike is the consequence of the employer's unfair labor practice, the employer is bound to reinstate the strikers even if it has hired others to replace them to avoid business paralysis (*Cromwell Commercial Employees and Laborers Union v. C.I.R.*). Reinstatement follows as a matter of right in a ULP strike. The question of a voluntary offer to return to work without conditions is relevant only to the payment of backwages; since no backwages were awarded and the union did not appeal, this was not in point.

The decision and resolution appealed from are affirmed.
