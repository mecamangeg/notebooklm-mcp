I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DONION TAN Y CUI @ DIONING, G.R. No. L-22697, November 2, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Atty. Marcelino N. Sayo, counsel for appellant Donion Tan, was granted a thirty-day extension to file the appellant's brief, which expired on September 29, 1965 [1]. By October 14, 1965, Atty. Sayo had still not filed the brief, prompting the Supreme Court to issue a resolution requiring him to explain why disciplinary action should not be taken against him [1]. On October 19, 1965, Atty. Sayo filed a verified explanation justifying his failure to file on the ground that he had been sickly and "suffering from hypertension" for the past six months [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the counsel's failure to file the appellant's brief is excusable due to his alleged hypertension.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court found the counsel's explanation unsatisfactory. The Court held that the excuse was invalid because: (1) the claim of suffering from hypertension was not supported by any medical certificate; (2) hypertension alone, in general, does not prevent a lawyer from preparing a client's brief; and (3) even assuming the counsel was partially disabled, he could have easily informed the Court in due time to avoid delay in the disposition of the case [2-4].

Accordingly, Atty. Marcelino N. Sayo was ordered to pay a fine of P50.00 for his failure to file the brief, and the Clerk of Court was directed to submit a name for appointment as counsel *de officio* for the appellant [4, 5].
