I. CAPTION
POLICARPO ALMEDA v. JULIAN FLORENTINO, G.R. No. L-23800, December 21, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Republic Act No. 183 (Pasay City Charter) originally provided in Section 14 that the Municipal Board shall appoint its own secretary [1]. On June 18, 1960, Republic Act No. 2709 amended Section 12 of the Charter, granting the Vice-Mayor the power to "appoint all the employees of the Board" [2, 3]. Relying on this amendment, the Vice-Mayor of Pasay City appointed petitioner Policarpo Almeda as Secretary of the Municipal Board on January 1, 1964 [4]. However, the Board refused to recognize Almeda and, relying on Section 14, appointed respondent Julian Florentino to the same position the next day [4]. Almeda filed a *quo warranto* proceeding claiming title to the office [4, 5]. The Court of First Instance of Pasay City dismissed the petition, ruling that the specific provision of Section 14 prevailed over the general appointing power in Section 12 [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the power to appoint the Secretary of the Municipal Board of Pasay City is vested in the Vice-Mayor under the amendatory Republic Act No. 2709.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that nothing in R.A. 2709 indicates an intention to repeal or modify Section 14 of the Pasay City Charter, which specifically vests the power to appoint the Secretary in the Municipal Board [6]. While R.A. 2709 amended Section 12 to give the Vice-Mayor the power to appoint "all the employees of the Board," the Court ruled that repeals by implication are not favored [6]. Applying the principle of *ut magis valeat quam pereat* (construction must be sought which gives effect to the whole statute), the Charter must be interpreted as limiting the Vice-Mayor's power under Section 12 to the appointment of all employees *other than* the Secretary [7]. The Secretary remains appointed by the Board itself as specifically prescribed by Section 14 [7]. The decision of the lower court dismissing the *quo warranto* petition was affirmed [8].
