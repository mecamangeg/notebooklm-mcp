I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JOSE GRIJALDO, G.R. No. L-20240, December 31, 1965, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
In 1943, Jose Grijaldo obtained five crop loans totaling P1,281.97 from the Bank of Taiwan, Ltd. in Bacolod City. These were evidenced by promissory notes and secured by a chattel mortgage on the standing crops on his land, Hacienda Campugas. By virtue of Vesting Order No. P-4 and the Philippine Property Act of 1946, the assets of the Bank of Taiwan were vested in the US Government and subsequently transferred to the Republic of the Philippines in 1954.

On September 29, 1954, the Republic made an extrajudicial demand for payment, which Grijaldo ignored. In 1961, the Republic filed a complaint for collection in the Justice of the Peace Court of Hinigaran, which dismissed the case on the ground of prescription. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental ruled in favor of the Republic, ordering Grijaldo to pay P2,377.23 (the value of the loans plus interest). Grijaldo appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Republic had no privity of contract, that the obligation was extinguished when the mortgaged crops were destroyed by enemy action, and that the action had prescribed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Republic has a cause of action against Grijaldo despite not being a party to the original contract.
2. W/N the loss of the mortgaged crops through enemy action extinguished the obligation to pay the loan.
3. W/N the action to collect the loan has prescribed.
4. W/N the lower court erred in applying the Ballantyne Scale of values as of the date the obligation was incurred (1943).

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Republic is the successor-in-interest of the rights, title, and interest in the loans. Through the Trading with the Enemy Act, Vesting Order No. P-4, and Transfer Agreements between the US and Philippine governments, the assets of the Bank of Taiwan were validly transferred to the Republic. This succession created the necessary privity of contract between the Republic and Grijaldo [1-3].

2. **NO.** The obligation under the promissory notes was not to deliver a determinate thing (the crops), but to pay a generic thing (the sum of money representing the loans). Under Article 1933 of the Civil Code, a simple loan involves the delivery of money on the condition that the same amount be paid. The chattel mortgage merely stood as security; the loss of the security does not extinguish the principal obligation to pay money, which can be satisfied from other sources [4].

3. **NO.** First, under Article 1108 of the Civil Code, prescription does not run against the State when it exercises sovereign functions to protect public property [5]. Second, even if prescription applied, the period was interrupted by Moratorium Laws (E.O. Nos. 25 and 32, R.A. No. 342), which suspended the running of the prescriptive period for 8 years and 6 months (from Nov. 18, 1944 to May 18, 1953). Deducting this suspension, the action was filed within the prescriptive period [5, 6].

4. **NO.** Following the ruling in *Hilado v. De la Costa*, contracts stipulating payments in Japanese war notes are enforced based on the value of the notes in Philippine currency at the time and place the obligation was *incurred*, not when it became due, unless agreed otherwise. Thus, the court correctly evaluated the loans based on the 1943 value [7].

**Decision affirmed.**
