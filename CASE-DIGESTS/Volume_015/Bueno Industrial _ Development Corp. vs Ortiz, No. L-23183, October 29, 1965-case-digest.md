**I. CAPTION**
BUENO INDUSTRIAL & DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION v. HON. MONTANO A. ORTIZ, MACARIO C. CONDE, RAFAEL C. AQUINO and R. C. AQUINO TIMBER and PLYWOOD Co., INC., G.R. No. L-23183, October 29, 1965, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Bueno Industrial & Development Corp. (BIDCOR) and respondent R. C. Aquino Timber and Plywood Co., Inc. (TIMPLY) held adjoining timber licenses in Agusan [1]. TIMPLY was granted Right-of-Way Permit No. 237 to construct a road through BIDCOR’s concession, subject to the condition that the Director of Forestry’s decision on boundaries would be final and that logs cut within the path belonged to BIDCOR [2].

Conflict arose when TIMPLY claimed BIDCOR stopped its trucks with violence. TIMPLY filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of Agusan, presided by respondent Judge Ortiz, seeking an injunction [3]. On February 10, 1964, Judge Ortiz issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining BIDCOR from interfering with TIMPLY’s operations [4].

However, prior to this injunction, Bureau of Forestry officials had already verified that TIMPLY was logging and hauling logs within BIDCOR’s area, not its own, in violation of the permit conditions. Forestry officials had ordered a moratorium and directed TIMPLY to stop operations [5-8]. BIDCOR filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court after the Court of Appeals dismissed a prior petition for lack of jurisdiction [9].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the writ of preliminary injunction.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the respondent Judge gravely abused his discretion [5]. The Court found that the allegation by TIMPLY that it had reached its own concession area was belied by the findings of the Bureau of Forestry [10]. By granting the preliminary injunction, the lower court effectively authorized TIMPLY to continue cutting and hauling logs within BIDCOR’s concession in defiance of the Forestry officials' orders imposing a moratorium [10].

The Court emphasized that under the express terms of the Road Right-of-Way Permit, the Bureau of Forestry is the proper government office invested with the authority to determine the exact location and boundaries of the right-of-way [11]. Any controversy regarding the extent of the right-of-way must be determined by said Bureau, not unilaterally by the licensee or the courts in disregard of administrative findings [11].

The petition was granted, the lower court's order and writ were set aside, and the Supreme Court's own preliminary injunction against TIMPLY was made permanent [12].
