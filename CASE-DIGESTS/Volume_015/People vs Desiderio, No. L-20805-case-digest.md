**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, plaintiff-appellant, vs. IGNACIO DESIDERIO, defendant-appellee, G.R. No. L-20805, November 29, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 17, 1958, an information was filed in the Municipal Court, and later in the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga City, charging Ignacio Desiderio with violation of Section 3601 of Republic Act No. 1937 (Tariff and Customs Code) for unlawfully possessing foreign brand cigarettes [1]. Desiderio filed a motion to quash, arguing that his criminal liability had been extinguished because he had already entered into a compromise agreement with the Collector of Customs on February 10, 1958, paying the fine or redeeming the forfeited property in accordance with Section 2307 of R.A. 1937 [2]. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the case [2]. The Solicitor General appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the settlement of the seizure case by payment of fine or redemption of forfeited property under Section 2307 of R.A. No. 1937 extinguishes the offender's criminal liability under Section 3601.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that settlement under Section 2307 does not extinguish criminal liability. The provision expressly states that such settlement discharges "all liability which may or might attach to the property... and all liability which might have been incurred under any bond given." It limits the discharge to the liability attaching to the *property* or the *bond*, and does not mention the liability falling on the *person* or *offender* [3, 4].

Furthermore, the Court noted that the previous law (Section 1369 of the Revised Administrative Code) explicitly allowed the Commissioner of Customs to compromise criminal liability. The elimination of this provision in R.A. 1937 demonstrates a clear legislative intent to no longer allow such compromises [5, 6]. Unlike the National Internal Revenue Code, which permits the compromise of criminal cases, the Tariff and Customs Code contains no such authorization [7].

**WHEREFORE**, the order appealed from is reversed and set aside and the case remanded to the Court *a quo* for further proceedings [7].
