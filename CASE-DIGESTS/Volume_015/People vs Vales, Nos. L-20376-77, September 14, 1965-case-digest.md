I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, plaintiff, vs. DOMINADOR VALES Y VICTA, accused. T. V. PICACHE'S AGENCIA DE EMPEÑOS, INC., movant-appellant, H. E. HEACOCK, INC., oppositor-appellee, G.R. Nos. L-20376-77, September 14, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Dominador Vales and Romeo Villadolid were charged with qualified theft for stealing wristwatches from H. E. Heacock, Inc. [1]. Pursuant to a search warrant, the Manila Police seized 145 watches from appellant T. V. Picache's Agencia de Empeños, Inc. [2]. The accused pleaded guilty to simple theft and accessory after the fact, respectively, for a reduced amount after deducting the value of the recovered watches [2]. The trial court convicted them and directed the return of all stolen articles, including those seized from the appellant, to the complainant Heacock [2]. The accused did not appeal and immediately began serving their sentences [3]. Seven months later, Picache filed a motion for the return of the 145 watches, arguing that the court deprived it of property without due process as the watches were not presented as evidence [4, 5]. The lower court denied the motion because the judgment had already become final [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court had jurisdiction to modify its decision regarding the return of the seized watches after the judgment had become final.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the trial court had no more jurisdiction over its decisions because they had already become final and executory [3]. Since the accused failed to appeal and commenced serving their sentences immediately, the court *a quo* lost the power to alter, amend, or modify its decisions, except for clerical errors [3].

While the trial court may have committed an error of law in ordering the delivery of the stolen articles to the complainant instead of requiring the parties to litigate ownership in an appropriate action, this error did not affect the court's jurisdiction [6, 7]. The Court distinguished this case from *Chua Hai v. Kapunan*, noting that the movant in that case filed for the return of articles while the court still had jurisdiction, whereas Picache's action came too late [7]. The appellant's remedy is to assert its claim over the watches in a separate civil action [7, 8].

The Order appealed from is affirmed [9].
