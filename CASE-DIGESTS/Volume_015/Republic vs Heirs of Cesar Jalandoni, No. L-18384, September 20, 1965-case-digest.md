I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HEIRS OF CESAR JALANDONI, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18384, September 20, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Isabel Ledesma died intestate in 1948. One of her heirs, Cesar Jalandoni, filed the estate and inheritance tax returns on November 19, 1948, reporting a net estate of roughly P1.3 million. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) issued initial assessments which the heirs paid. However, on May 9, 1956—more than seven years after the return was filed—the BIR issued a third deficiency assessment for estate and inheritance taxes. The BIR claimed the heirs had filed a false and fraudulent return by: (1) omitting seven lots; (2) under-declaring the value of rice and sugar lands; and (3) under-declaring shares of stock. The heirs argued that the right to collect had prescribed under the 5-year period in Section 331 of the National Internal Revenue Code. The Collector countered that the 10-year period under Section 332(a) applied due to fraud. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the Republic, finding the returns fraudulent.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the tax returns filed by the heirs were false or fraudulent, such that the 10-year prescriptive period for collection applies.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the heirs did not commit fraud.

Regarding the alleged **omission of seven lots**, the Court found that three were actually included in the return; one belonged to an heir (Delfin), not the deceased; and the remaining three were conjugal property already declared in the surviving spouse's income tax return [1]. The omission was an honest mistake or inadvertence, which does not amount to fraud [2].

Regarding the **undervaluation of lands**, the Court ruled that the difference between the heirs' valuation and the Collector's appraisal constitutes a mere difference of opinion, not fraud. The assessment was made five years after the return, a period long enough to warrant an increase in real estate value [2].

Regarding the **shares of stock**, the fact that the reported value did not tally with the book value is not indicative of fraud, as book values often become known only months after death and stock prices fluctuate [3, 4].

Since there was no evidence of an intention to evade payment, the fraud exception under Section 332(a) does not apply. Consequently, the government's right to collect had prescribed under Section 331 of the National Internal Revenue Code [4].

**Decision reversed.**
