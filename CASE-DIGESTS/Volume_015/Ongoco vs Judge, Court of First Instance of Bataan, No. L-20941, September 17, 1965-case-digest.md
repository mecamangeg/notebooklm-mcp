I. CAPTION
FELIX ONGOCO and BELEN CONSUNJI v. THE HON. JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF BATAAN, THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF BATAAN, APOLONIO SORIANO and CIRILA MINA, G.R. No. L-20941, September 17, 1965, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, spouses Ongoco and Consunji, sold a parcel of land in Bataan to respondents Soriano and Mina for P1,500.00 with a right to repurchase within three years [1]. Petitioners failed to repurchase within the period. Consequently, respondents filed a "petition" in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bataan to declare them absolute owners and transfer the certificate of title [1]. Although docketed as a Special Civil Case, no summons was served on petitioners; they were merely sent a copy of the petition by registered mail [2]. Petitioners moved to postpone the hearing, but the CFI denied the motion in their absence and rendered judgment declaring respondents absolute owners [2, 3]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the Judge acted without jurisdiction [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for consolidation of ownership under Article 1607 of the Civil Code requires the filing of an ordinary civil action with service of summons.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that Article 1607, which requires a judicial order for consolidation of ownership after the vendor has been "duly heard," contemplates an **ordinary civil action**, not a mere motion or incident [4, 5]. Citing *Tacdoro v. Arcenas*, the Court ruled that as an ordinary action, it is governed by the rules on summons (Rule 7) [4, 5]. The defendant (vendor) is entitled to service of summons and a period of 15 days to file a motion to dismiss or an answer [5].

The failure of the trial court to observe these rules regarding summons is a sufficient ground to attack its judgment on jurisdictional grounds [5, 6]. Even assuming petitioners' motion to postpone was a voluntary submission to jurisdiction, they were still entitled to time to answer [7]. The lower court's immediate judgment deprived petitioners of their right to be heard in violation of Article 1607 [7].

The writ of certiorari is **GRANTED**, the judgment is set aside, and the respondent Judge is ordered to allow petitioners to file their answer within 15 days [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
