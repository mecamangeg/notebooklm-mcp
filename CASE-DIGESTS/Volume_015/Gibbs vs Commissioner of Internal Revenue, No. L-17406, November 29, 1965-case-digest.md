I. CAPTION
FINLEY J. GIBBS and DIANE P. GIBBS v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE and COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-17406, November 29, 1965, Regala, J. [1-3]

II. FACTS
On February 8, 1956, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) issued a Deficiency Income Tax Assessment for the year 1950 against the petitioners in the amount of P16,873.00 [4]. Allison J. Gibbs, signing as attorney-in-fact for his brother Finley, acknowledged receipt, formally protested the assessment, and requested a correction [4]. On August 28, 1956, the CIR denied the request and demanded payment [5]. On October 3, 1956, Allison J. Gibbs paid the assessment in full but simultaneously demanded an immediate refund, stating that if not refunded he would file a petition for review and charge "attorney's fees" [6, 7]. On October 26, 1956, the CIR denied the demand for refund; this letter was received by Allison J. Gibbs' office on November 14, 1956 [8].

Nearly two years later, on September 29, 1958, Allison J. Gibbs wrote the CIR reiterating the refund demand [9]. On October 1, 1958, petitioners filed a Petition for Review and Refund with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [10]. The CIR moved to dismiss on the ground of prescription, arguing the petition was filed beyond the 30-day appeal period and the 2-year refund period [10, 11]. The CTA dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction [12]. Petitioners appealed, arguing that Allison J. Gibbs was merely an attorney-in-fact, not counsel, and thus his receipt of the denial did not trigger the prescriptive period [13, 14].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for review was filed within the prescriptive period.
2. W/N the claim for refund of withholding tax credits was barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court found that Allison J. Gibbs acted not merely as an agent but as legal counsel. He acknowledged the assessment, protested it, paid it, and in his demand letter explicitly threatened to collect "attorney's fees" [15, 16]. Therefore, receipt of the CIR's decision on November 14, 1956, by Allison J. Gibbs constituted receipt by the petitioners [17]. The 30-day prescriptive period for filing a petition for review under Section 11 of R.A. 1125 began on that date, making the petition filed on October 1, 1958, untimely [17].

2. **YES.** A taxpayer contributing to the withholding tax system is not merely depositing funds but extinguishing their tax obligation; thus, the tax liability is deemed paid when it falls due at the end of the tax year [18]. The two-year prescriptive period under Section 306 of the Internal Revenue Code begins from that date [18]. The Court reiterated the doctrine that the delay of the Collector in rendering a decision does not extend the peremptory period fixed by the statute; the suit must be filed before the two-year period expires regardless of whether the Collector has decided [19, 20].

Petition dismissed [20].
