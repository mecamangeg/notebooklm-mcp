I. CAPTION
ACAY BALBALIO and POLITO LIC-CANO v. HEIRS OF THE DECEASED SPOUSES IGNACIO B. GALABAN and MAGDALENA BAUTISTA, represented by their administrators VICENTE GALABAN and NAPOLEON BACORRO, and THE HON. JUDGE AMADO S. SANTIAGO, G.R. No. L-21496, September 17, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On November 28, 1962, the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan rendered judgment in Civil Case No. U-492 against the Heirs of Galaban (respondents) [1]. Respondents filed a notice of appeal and record on appeal on January 3, 1963, but filed the appeal bond on January 4, 1963 [1]. Petitioners Balbalio and Lic-cano moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the appeal bond was filed one day after the lapse of the reglementary period [2]. The trial court denied the motion, gave due course to the appeal, and denied petitioners' subsequent motion for reconsideration [2]. Consequently, petitioners filed a special civil action for certiorari in the Supreme Court, alleging they had no plain, adequate, and speedy remedy [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioners may avail of certiorari to challenge the trial court's denial of their motion to dismiss the appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** Petitioners cannot avail of certiorari because they have a plain, adequate, and speedy remedy in the ordinary course of law [4]. The Supreme Court held that under Section 1(b), Rule 50 (formerly Section 1[a], Rule 52) of the Rules of Court, the petitioners may file a motion to dismiss in the appellate court in their capacity as appellees [3]. The fact that the trial court previously denied the motion does not preclude them from reiterating it in the appellate court (*Garganta v. Court of Appeals*) [3]. A motion to dismiss filed with the appellate court has the effect of an appeal from the trial court's order denying the dismissal (*Santiago v. Valenzuela*) [4].

Petition denied [5].
