I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE COMPANY v. CITY OF DAVAO and the PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-23080, September 20, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On August 7 and December 27, 1963, the City Council of Davao passed Resolutions Nos. 664 and 2015, authorizing the establishment and operation of a city-owned telephone system to address the urgent need for expansion which the incumbent operator, Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), failed to meet. Pursuant to this, the City entered into a contract with ITT Philippines, Inc. for the installation of the system for P3,587,000.00. PLDT, which had operated in the city since 1931, filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus with the Supreme Court. PLDT argued that the City lacked the power to operate a telephone system, that the project violated PLDT's vested rights as the prior operator, and that the City failed to secure a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) from the Public Service Commission (PSC).

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City of Davao has the power to establish and operate a telephone system.
2. W/N the City's operation violates PLDT's vested rights under the "prior operator rule."
3. W/N the City is required to secure a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity from the Public Service Commission.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The City of Davao has the authority to establish a telephone system under the General Welfare Clause (Section 14(ee)) of its Charter (Commonwealth Act 51). Although the power was not expressly enumerated at the time the resolutions were passed, the Court ruled that the General Welfare Clause implies the power to establish public utilities conducive to the "comfort, convenience, and general welfare" of the inhabitants. The Court found the City was responding to a pressing necessity to serve the public, given that PLDT's service was limited to the *poblacion* and failed to meet the demand for 3,000 additional lines.

2. **NO.** PLDT cannot invoke the "prior operator rule" because its franchise (Act No. 3436) expressly provides that the rights granted "shall not be exclusive." A municipal corporation is not prevented from operating a competing utility when the existing franchise is not exclusive. Furthermore, the prior operator rule applies only when the old operator offers to meet the increase in demand the moment it arises, not after another operator has already made an offer to serve public needs.

3. **NO.** The City is exempt from securing a CPCN. Section 14(e) of the Public Service Act explicitly exempts public services owned or operated by government entities from the requirement of obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity. As a government entity, Davao City falls within this exemption.

The petition is DENIED.
