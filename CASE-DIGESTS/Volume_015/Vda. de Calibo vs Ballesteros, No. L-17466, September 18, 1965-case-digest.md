I. CAPTION
FAUSTINA JAMISOLA VDA. DE CALIBO, et al. v. TIBURCIO BALLESTEROS, THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS and THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE & NATURAL RESOURCES, G.R. No. L-17466, September 18, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Tiburcio Ballesteros filed a sales application for a parcel of public land. This application conflicted with a prior application by Barbara Andoy (petitioners' predecessor), which was rejected by the Director of Lands in 1930 due to bad faith. Years later, petitioners (Jamisolas) claimed portions of the land declared as public domain.

Following an investigation and hearing where both parties presented evidence, the Director of Lands rendered a decision in 1953 dismissing the Jamisolas' claims and giving due course to Ballesteros' application. Petitioners appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Initially, the Secretary modified the decision, granting petitioners preferential rights to specific lots based on the government's "land for the landless" policy. Ballesteros moved for reconsideration, submitting proof that petitioners were actually wealthy owners of landed properties. The Secretary gave petitioners thirty (30) days to answer or refute these allegations, but they failed to do so. Consequently, the Secretary reversed his initial ruling and affirmed the Director of Lands' decision. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with prohibition, which the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Sur dismissed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Director of Lands committed grave abuse of discretion in rendering his decision.
2. W/N the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources violated petitioners' right to due process.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Director of Lands acts within his jurisdiction as the officer charged with carrying out the provisions of the Public Land Law (Section 3). He has control over the concession or disposition of public lands, and his findings of fact, when approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, are conclusive (Section 4). Even if the Director erred in appraising the evidence, such error is merely one of judgment and not an act of grave abuse of discretion annullable by a writ of certiorari. Grave abuse of discretion exists only when there is a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.

2. **NO.** The Secretary gave petitioners thirty days to deny or refute the claim that they were not "landless" and owned other properties. Despite this opportunity, petitioners failed to answer either by choice or through neglect. Since they were given sufficient time to be heard, the procedure adopted by the Secretary for the expeditious resolution of the case did not infringe on the fundamentals of fair play or the right to due process.

The appealed order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED**.
