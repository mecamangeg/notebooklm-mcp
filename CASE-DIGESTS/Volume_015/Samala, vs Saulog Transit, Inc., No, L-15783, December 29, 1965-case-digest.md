I. CAPTION
JOSE SAMALA v. SAULOG TRANSIT, INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-15783, December 29, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jose Samala filed an application with the Public Service Commission (PSC) to operate auto-trucks for passenger and freight service on the line between Cavite City and Sta. Cruz, Zambales [2, 3]. Respondents Saulog Transit, Inc. and Victory Liner, Inc. opposed the application, alleging that their existing services were sufficient and that granting the application would cause ruinous competition [3]. PSC Commissioner Prieto rendered a decision granting Samala a certificate of public convenience, finding that the service would benefit the public [3, 4]. However, two other Commissioners (Aspillera and Galang) dissented, which resulted in a negative outcome for Samala's application [3-5]. Samala appealed the decision to the Supreme Court [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner should be granted a certificate of public convenience to operate the proposed transport line. [3, 6]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the dissenting opinions of Commissioners Aspillera and Galang and affirmed the decision of Commissioner Prieto granting the certificate [7, 8].

The Court held that the findings of Commissioner Prieto were fully justified because there was no existing public utility operator making direct trips from Cavite City to Sta. Cruz, Zambales [3, 6]. Evidence showed that passengers, including merchants and laborers working in naval bases and mines, had to make transfers in Manila or Olongapo, causing delays and additional expenses [3, 7]. Furthermore, the petitioner’s proposed route (290 km) was distinct from the lines operated by the oppositors, which only terminated at Manila or Olongapo [3, 6]. The Court concluded that the proposed line is beneficial to the riding public [3].

Decision of Commissioner Prieto affirmed [1, 8].
