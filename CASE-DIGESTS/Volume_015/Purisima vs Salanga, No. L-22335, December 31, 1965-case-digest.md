I. CAPTION
AMANTE P. PURISIMA v. HON. ANGELINO C. SALANGA, THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS, THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS and GREGORIO CORDERO, G.R. No. L-22335, December 31, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Amante Purisima and Gregorio Cordero were candidates for Provincial Board Member of Ilocos Sur in the November 12, 1963 elections. During the canvass, Purisima noted that returns from 41 precincts contained patent erasures and superimpositions. He presented Nacionalista Party copies of the returns showing a discrepancy of 5,042 votes—enough to alter the election result—and requested the suspension of the canvass. The Board of Canvassers denied the request and proclaimed Cordero the winner. After the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) annulled the proclamation, Purisima filed a petition for a judicial recount in the Court of First Instance (CFI) under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the COMELEC copies of the returns relied upon by Purisima could not be used because they had not been previously submitted to the Board of Canvassers. Purisima filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the failure to submit COMELEC copies of election returns to the Board of Canvassers precludes a candidate from using them in a petition for judicial recount.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the petitioner’s right to a recount should not be prejudiced. The Court held that **COMELEC copies are "authentic copies"** within the meaning of Section 163 of the Revised Election Code (*Lawsin v. Escalona*). Furthermore, when patent erasures and superimpositions appear on the face of the returns, it is the **mandatory duty of the Board of Canvassers to suspend the canvass** to allow for verification (*Javier v. Commission on Elections*). The Court reasoned that since the Board improperly refused to suspend the canvass—thereby preventing Purisima from securing and submitting the COMELEC copies—this failure cannot be used to defeat his right to a judicial remedy. To rule otherwise would violate the principle that election laws must be interpreted to give effect to the **expressed will of the electorate**.

The dismissal of the petition for recount is set aside, and the respondent Judge is ordered to proceed with the recount.
