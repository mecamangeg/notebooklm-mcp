I. CAPTION
AURORA VILLAMIN SY v. THE HON. COMMISSIONER and BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF IMMIGRATION, G.R. No. L-21468, November 29, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On November 4, 1949, Chiu Wan Hong, a Chinese citizen, was admitted to the Philippines as a temporary visitor. Years later, on December 18, 1954, the Commissioner of Immigration arrested petitioner Aurora Villamin Sy, alleging that she was actually Chiu Wan Hong and had overstayed her visa [1, 2]. The Board of Special Inquiry (BSI) conducted an investigation and concluded petitioner was the same person as Chiu Wan Hong based on a comparison of photographs. This finding was affirmed by the Board of Commissioners (BOC) on December 8, 1955, and a warrant of deportation was issued on January 12, 1956 [3, 4].

Petitioner's counsel secured several extensions for the execution of the warrant until October 1, 1962. On October 4, 1962—nearly seven years after the deportation order—petitioner filed a petition for *habeas corpus* in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, claiming the warrant was void because she was not Chiu Wan Hong. The CFI denied the petition [3]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the sufficiency of the evidence against her [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for *habeas corpus* is barred by laches.
2. W/N the decision of the Board of Commissioners was supported by substantial evidence.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the action is barred by the principle of laches. The case was not instituted until almost seven years after the rendition of the BOC decision (December 8, 1955) and the issuance of the deportation warrant (January 12, 1956) [5]. Citing *Lim Son v. Commissioner of Immigration* (L-18622), the Court ruled that such a delay precludes the petitioner from questioning the legality of the detention [5, 6].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the Board's decision was based on substantial evidence, sufficient *prima facie* to sustain its conclusion [7]. The Boards compared the picture of Chiu Wan Hong with that of petitioner on her Alien Certificate of Registration and found a strong resemblance in the contour of the nose, lips, eyebrows, ears, and face shape [4, 7, 8]. Petitioner failed to refute this evidence; she did not appear personally before the Boards or the CFI to allow for a visual comparison, despite opportunities to do so [9]. Her failure to appear suggested a conviction that doing so would confirm the Boards' conclusion [9]. The Court further noted that petitioner's attack on the *correctness* of the factual findings goes to the *wisdom*, not the *validity*, of the decision, and thus does not render the warrant void for *habeas corpus* purposes [10, 11].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [5].
