I. CAPTION
ANGELES UBALDE PUIG, ET AL. v. ESTELA MAGBANUA PEÑAFLORIDA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15939, November 29, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Carmen Ubalde Vda. de Parcon died on April 10, 1953, without forced heirs, leaving a will and survived by nephews and nieces. During her lifetime, she executed two notarial deeds of donation in favor of her niece, respondent Estela Magbanua Peñaflorida.

The first deed (November 24, 1948) was titled *Donacion Mortis Causa*. It stipulated that the donation would take effect upon the donor's death and forbade registration until then. However, it required the donee to cover medical and burial expenses. It also stated that the donor reserved the right to mortgage or sell the property "when and if she needs funds." The donee's husband, Governor Peñaflorida, also signed to assume liability for the expenses.

The second deed (December 28, 1949) was also titled *Escritura de Donacion Mortis Causa*. It provided that before her death, the donor could alienate, sell, or mortgage the properties to *any* person or entity.

Petitioners (nephews and nieces of the deceased) filed a suit in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo to declare the donations void for lack of testamentary formalities. The trial court declared both donations *mortis causa* and void, but validated a portion of the second donation (Lot 2053) because it was expressly confirmed in the donor's Last Will and Testament. Both parties appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the donations executed in 1948 and 1949 are donations *inter vivos* (valid) or *mortis causa* (void for lack of formalities).

IV. RULING
**1. On the 1948 Donation: YES (It is Inter Vivos).**
The Court ruled that the 1948 donation is *inter vivos* and valid. Although the deed was titled *mortis causa* and stated it would take effect upon death, these labels are not controlling when contradicted by other provisions. The Court applied the principle that in case of doubt, conveyances should be deemed *inter vivos* to avoid uncertainty regarding ownership (Article 1378, Civil Code; *Laureta v. Mata*).

The decisive factors were:
(a) The donation was made for valuable consideration (onerous), specifically the donee's undertaking to pay for the donor's medical and burial expenses. Conveyances for onerous consideration are governed by the rules of contracts, not testaments (*Manalo v. De Mesa*).
(b) The donor's power to revoke was restricted. She reserved the right to sell only "when and if she needs funds." This limitation implies that she had already transferred the proprietary right to the donee, subject only to a specific condition, unlike a true *mortis causa* disposition which is revocable *ad nutum* (at the donor's absolute discretion).

**2. On the 1949 Donation: NO (It is Mortis Causa).**
The Court ruled that the 1949 donation is *mortis causa* and therefore void for failing to observe the formalities of a will. The deed expressly reserved the donor's right to alienate or sell the property to *any* person at *any* time before her death. This unlimited power to revoke shows that the donor retained full control and ownership, and no right was conveyed to the donee until the donor's death. Since the disposition was ambulatory and revocable at will (*ad nutum*), it was a testamentary act that required the formalities of a will (*Bonsato v. Court of Appeals*).

However, the Court affirmed that the specific legacy of a portion of Lot 2053 contained in the donor's subsequent will was valid, as it met the testamentary requirements.

**Disposition:** The appealed decision is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The deed of donation of November 24, 1948 is declared VALID as a donation *inter vivos*. The deed of December 28, 1949 is declared VOID as a defective donation *mortis causa*, except for the portion of Lot 2053 validated by the donor's will.
