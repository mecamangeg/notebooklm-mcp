**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES OF RAMON GAN CHING LIM. RAMON GAN CHING LIM v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21859, December 24, 1965, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Ramon Gan Ching Lim, born on January 29, 1929, in Goa, Camarines Sur, filed a petition for naturalization [1, 2]. He has resided in Goa continuously since birth, is single, and holds a degree in mechanical engineering from National University, although he is engaged in farming [1, 2]. He owns land with a market value of approximately P13,000.00 and reported a gross income of P4,944.97 for the year 1962, with cash assets totaling P6,137.33 [1, 2]. He speaks and writes English and the Bicol dialect fluently [1, 2]. Two credible witnesses, the incumbent mayor and a councilor of Goa, testified for him [2]. The Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur granted his petition [3, 4]. The Office of the Solicitor General appealed the decision [4]. Although the Provincial Fiscal moved to withdraw the appeal citing a lack of justification, the Supreme Court denied the motion and treated the Solicitor General's comment as the appellant's brief [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner possesses the necessary qualifications and none of the disqualifications to become a Filipino citizen.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that the petitioner successfully established his qualification for citizenship [1, 5]. The Court noted that despite being single and having no descendants, his income of P4,944.97 in 1962 was sufficient to satisfy the requirement of having a lucrative occupation [2]. Furthermore, the testimony of credible witnesses and his financial stability—evidenced by his land ownership and cash assets—demonstrated that he possesses all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications to become a citizen of the Philippines [1, 2]. The decision of the lower court granting the application for naturalization was affirmed [1, 5].
