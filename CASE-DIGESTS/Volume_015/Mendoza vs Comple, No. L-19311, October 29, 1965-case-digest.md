I. CAPTION
FILEMON H. MENDOZA, ET AL. v. AQUILINA COMPLE, G.R. No. L-19311, October 29, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Mendoza, et al. negotiated with defendant Comple for the purchase of a parcel of land. Comple agreed to sell the property for P4,500.00 and granted the plaintiffs a period of three weeks (from April 15 to May 6, 1961) to raise the amount [1]. It was agreed that the deed of conveyance would be executed once the plaintiffs were ready with the cash [2]. However, on May 1, 1961, before the expiration of the three-week period, Comple informed the plaintiffs that she was withdrawing from the agreement [2]. The plaintiffs filed a suit to compel Comple to execute the sale [3]. The Court of First Instance of Batangas dismissed the complaint, ruling that the agreement was merely an accepted promise to sell which, lacking consideration distinct from the price, could be withdrawn by the promisor [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendant is bound by her promise to sell the land despite the lack of a separate consideration.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. The Court found that the facts merely described a unilateral promise to sell, as there was no allegation that the plaintiffs had reciprocally promised to buy the land [4]. Under Article 1479 of the New Civil Code, an accepted promise to sell is binding upon the promisor only if the promise is supported by a consideration distinct from the price [5]. Since there was no allegation of such distinct consideration (e.g., option money), the defendant was not bound to stand by her promise and was entitled to withdraw it even after acceptance [5]. The Court relied on the rulings in *Southwestern Sugar & Molasses Co. v. Atlantic, Gulf & Pacific Co.* and *Navarro v. Sugar Producers Association* [5]. The appealed order is affirmed [6].
