I. CAPTION
ROSARIO OLIVEROS, JOSE DELFIN, CLARA OLIVEROS and AMPARO OLIVEROS v. HON. JUDGE JOSE QUERUBIN, Presiding Judge of Branch II, COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF OCCIDENTAL NEGROS, G.R. No. L-16905, November 29, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners received the adverse decision in Civil Case No. 3742 on March 16, 1957 [1]. After their motion for reconsideration was denied, they moved to appeal as paupers and requested a 15-day extension to file the record on appeal, which the trial court granted [1]. However, other motions regarding the attachment of exhibits were denied [1]. Petitioners then filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-12466), which resulted in a decision on October 20, 1959, ordering respondent Judge Querubin to allow the petitioners to appeal as paupers and to attach their exhibits [2].

On December 9, 1959, respondent Judge issued an order implementing the Supreme Court's directive [2]. Petitioners received this order on December 14, 1959, and subsequently filed their record on appeal on January 7, 1960 [2]. Upon motion by the defendant, respondent Judge dismissed the appeal on the ground that it was filed out of time [2]. Petitioners filed the instant petition for mandamus to compel the judge to approve their appeal [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners' record on appeal was filed out of time.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the record on appeal was filed beyond the reglementary period [4, 5].

The Court computed that out of the total 45-day period (30 days regular period plus the 15-day extension granted by the lower court), the petitioners had already consumed 36 days during the proceedings prior to their first petition with the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-12466) [5]. This left them with only 9 days remaining to perfect their appeal [5]. Assuming the period resumed running on December 14, 1959, when petitioners received the order implementing the previous Supreme Court decision, the final deadline was December 23, 1959 [5]. Since the record on appeal was filed only on January 7, 1960, it was late [5].

The Court rejected the petitioners' contention that the period to appeal started anew from the receipt of the implementing order [6]. The Court ruled that the right to appeal did not proceed from the Supreme Court's decision in the previous certiorari case, nor did that decision wipe out the time that had already elapsed since the receipt of the lower court's decision [6].

Petition for writ of mandamus is denied [7].
