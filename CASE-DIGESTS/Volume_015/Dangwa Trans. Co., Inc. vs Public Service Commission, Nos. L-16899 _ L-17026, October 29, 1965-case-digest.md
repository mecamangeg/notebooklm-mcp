I. CAPTION
DANGWA TRANSPORTATION CO., INC. v. THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, et al., G.R. Nos. L-16899 & L-17026, October 29, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Pangasinan Transportation Co., Inc. (PANTRANCO) operated buses between Baguio and Tarlac. On June 29, 1959, it applied with the Public Service Commission (PSC) to extend its line to Manila as a non-stop express service, solely to accommodate through-passengers who otherwise had to transfer buses in Tarlac, causing inconvenience [1]. Petitioner Dangwa Transportation Co., an existing operator on the Baguio-Manila line, opposed the application, alleging adequate service and fearing ruinous competition [2]. However, Dangwa subsequently filed its own application for 22 additional units on the same route [2].

During the proceedings, Dangwa filed a motion to postpone the scheduled trial on January 13, 1960, but failed to furnish a copy to PANTRANCO and did not appear at the hearing, assuming the postponement would be granted [2]. The PSC denied the motion, considered the case submitted, and granted PANTRANCO's application [3]. Dangwa appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the "prior operator rule" bars the grant of PANTRANCO's application for extension.
2. W/N Petitioner was denied due process when the PSC denied its motion for postponement.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the doctrine protecting old and established operators against new ones (citing *Batangas Trans. Co. v. Orlanes*) does not apply because PANTRANCO was not a new or irregular operator, but one with an existing authorized line (Baguio-Tarlac) [4]. The application was not primarily to capture general public demand, but to serve passengers who already patronized PANTRANCO and would benefit from the direct extension [4]. Furthermore, the claim of ruinous competition was speculative and negated by Dangwa's own application for additional units, which constituted an admission that the volume of traffic justified increased service [5].

2. **NO.** Petitioner was remiss in its duty regarding the motion for postponement by failing to furnish a copy to the respondent with notice of hearing as required by Rule 26, Section 4, and by failing to appear at the trial based on the mere assumption that the motion would be granted [6].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [7].
