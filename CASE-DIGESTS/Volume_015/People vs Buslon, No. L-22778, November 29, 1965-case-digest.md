I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. TEOFILO B. BUSLON and RUSTICO ALBURO, G.R. No. L-22778, November 29, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Rustico Alburo was charged with murder in the Court of First Instance of Agusan. The prosecution’s evidence was heard by the regular District Judge Montano Ortiz in December 1963. In April 1964, the Department of Justice assigned respondent Judge Teofilo Buslon as the vacation judge for Agusan. Judge Buslon scheduled the reception of defense evidence for April 8, 1964. On the scheduled date, the Provincial Fiscal and private prosecutor were absent due to lack of proper notice. A Special Counsel present objected and sought a continuance, noting he was not handling the case personally. Judge Buslon denied the motion, proceeded with the trial, heard the defense witnesses (who were cross-examined by the Special Counsel), and subsequently rendered a decision acquitting Alburo. The People filed a petition for certiorari to annul the proceedings, arguing that Judge Buslon lacked authority to decide a case partly tried by the regular judge and that the lack of notice constituted a grave abuse of discretion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a vacation judge has the authority to hear and decide a case already partly tried by a regular judge.
2. W/N the judgment of acquittal rendered by the vacation judge bars relitigation of the case.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the authority granted to Judge Buslon was sufficient. Under the Judiciary Act, the Department of Justice designated him to act in the court "for the purpose of trying all kinds of cases and to enter judgments therein." While it is not customary for vacation judges to hear cases partly tried by regular judges, the designation was broad enough to authorize Judge Buslon to conduct the trial and render a valid judgment if he was willing to do so [1].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the judgment of acquittal is valid and bars relitigation. Since the court had jurisdiction over the case and the charge was sufficient, the acquittal after trial constitutes a bar to further prosecution; otherwise, the accused would be placed in double jeopardy [2]. The Court noted that while there were irregularities regarding the notice, they did not vitiate the trial or amount to a lack of jurisdiction, particularly because the Special Counsel participated by cross-examining the defense witnesses [2].

The petition for certiorari was denied [3].
