I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BECOME A FILIPINO CITIZEN. SIO KIM alias JOHN DIA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20415, December 29, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On October 18, 1960, Sio Kim filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Surigao [1]. He did not file a declaration of intention, claiming exemption under Section 6 of the Naturalization Law based on his continuous residence in the Philippines [2]. The Solicitor General opposed the petition, arguing that the petitioner failed to file the required declaration of intention [3]. While the trial court initially found him qualified, it noted he might already be a Filipino citizen; however, adhering to Supreme Court rulings that citizenship cannot be adjudged via declaratory relief, the court amended its decision to grant the naturalization [3, 4]. The Solicitor General appealed, contending that Sio Kim was not exempt from the declaration requirement because he failed to provide primary and secondary education to all his eight children [2, 5]. The record showed that not one of his children finished high school; for instance, his daughter Veronica quit school to work in his store, and others stopped schooling after their first or third years [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a declaration of intention.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. Under Section 6 of the Naturalization Law, an applicant may be exempt from filing a declaration of intention if they have resided continuously in the Philippines for 30 years or more, provided they also establish that they have given primary and secondary education to *all* their children in public or government-recognized private schools [2, 7]. The evidence revealed that none of Sio Kim's children completed high school [6]. Consequently, he did not meet the additional educational requirement to qualify for the exemption [8]. The failure to file a declaration of intention is a jurisdictional defect that renders the entire naturalization proceeding null and void [8].

The judgment appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DISMISSED** [8].
