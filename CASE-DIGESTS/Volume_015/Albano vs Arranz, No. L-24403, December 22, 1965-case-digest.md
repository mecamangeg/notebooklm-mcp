I. CAPTION
DELFIN B. ALBANO, ET AL. v. THE HON. MANUEL ARRANZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-24403, December 22, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On March 18, 1965, a shooting incident occurred at the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Isabela during the hearing of an election protest, resulting in the death of two persons [1]. The Provincial Fiscal filed an information for multiple murder directly with the CFI against petitioners Delfin Albano, his brother, and others [1]. Respondent Judge Arranz conducted an investigation purportedly under Section 13, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court by taking the declarations of four witnesses and reviewing medical certificates [2]. Finding probable cause, the Judge issued warrants of arrest and referred the case back to the Fiscal to file the corresponding information [2]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the information and warrants were patent nullities [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a criminal proceeding under Section 13, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court can be initiated by an information filed by the Provincial Fiscal.
2. W/N the respondent Judge correctly followed the procedure for preliminary investigation prescribed in Section 13, Rule 112.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Section 13, Rule 112 specifically governs cases initiated "upon complaint filed directly with the Court of First Instance" [4, 5]. Under Section 2 of Rule 110, a criminal "complaint" may only be filed by the offended party, a peace officer, or an authorized government employee [5]. The Provincial Fiscal is not included in this list, and thus the document filed was an "information," not a "complaint" [5]. Consequently, the proceedings conducted by the respondent Judge lacked legal basis as the rule requires a complaint, not an information [5, 6].

2. **NO.** Section 13, Rule 112 requires the Judge to conduct *both* the preliminary examination and preliminary investigation *simultaneously* [7, 8]. This procedure mandates that the Judge receive the evidence of the complainant *in the presence of the accused*, as well as the evidence of the accused if they so desire [8]. The respondent Judge erroneously followed the old procedure of conducting a mere *ex parte* preliminary examination [7, 9]. Since compliance with the specific procedure in Section 13 is a requirement of due process, the non-observance thereof rendered the proceedings null and void [10].

Petition granted. The order of arrest issued by the respondent Judge is set aside [10].
