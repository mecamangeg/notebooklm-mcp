I. CAPTION
LI TONG PEK v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20, November 29, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Li Tong Pek, a Chinese citizen residing in Naga City, filed for naturalization. He is married to a Chinese citizen and has eight children [1]. He is employed at a ricemill owned by his brother, earning an average monthly income of P390.00 [2]. His wife also works as a cashier earning P250.00 monthly [3]. Petitioner enrolled his four children of school age in the Anglo-Chinese High School and Hope Christian School in Naga City [3]. These schools are recognized by the government but are run by Chinese mentors and attended predominantly by Chinese students [3]. The Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur granted the petition, but the Republic appealed, challenging the petitioner's economic qualifications and the schooling of his children [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner possesses a known lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation.
2. W/N the petitioner evinced a sincere desire to become a Filipino citizen despite enrolling his children in Chinese schools.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that an income of P390.00 a month is not considered lucrative, especially considering the petitioner has a wife and eight children to support, along with the high cost of living and low purchasing value of the currency [2]. The wife's additional income is considered immaterial because, under Section 2, paragraph 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, the petitioner himself must possess the required lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation [3].

2. **NO.** The Court held that enrolling children in schools run by Chinese mentors and attended predominantly by Chinese students indicates that the petitioner has not evinced a sincere desire to become a Filipino citizen [3]. Such schools are operated primarily for the education of Chinese children, and this circumstance is sufficient to disqualify the petitioner from citizenship [3, 5].

Decision REVERSED [6].
