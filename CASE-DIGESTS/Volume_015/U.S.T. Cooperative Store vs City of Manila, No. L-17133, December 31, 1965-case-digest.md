I. CAPTION
U.S.T. COOPERATIVE STORE v. THE CITY OF MANILA and MARCELINO SARMIENTO, G.R. No. L-17133, December 31, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
U.S.T. Cooperative Store, a duly organized cooperative with net assets not exceeding P500,000, paid municipal taxes and license fees to the City of Manila totaling P12,345.10 from July 1957 to December 1958 [1, 2]. Republic Act No. 2023, enacted on June 22, 1957, provided tax exemptions for registered cooperatives [2, 3]. The Cooperative was initially unaware of this law and continued payments [4]. It later sought a refund, claiming exemption under Section 66(1) of R.A. 2023. The City of Manila opposed, arguing that the Cooperative was not exempt because it transacted business with the general public and that the payments were voluntary and non-recoverable [4, 5]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the Cooperative, ordering the refund. The City appealed [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Cooperative is exempt from taxes under R.A. 2023 despite transacting business with the general public.
2. W/N the taxes paid voluntarily under a mistake of fact are recoverable.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that transacting business with the general public is not a ground for non-exemption under Section 66(1) of R.A. 2023. The only requisites for exemption are: (1) the cooperative is registered under the Act, and (2) its net assets do not exceed P500,000 [5]. Under Section 4(1), existing cooperatives were deemed registered under the new Act [3, 5]. While Section 58 restricts business with non-members, violation thereof does not carry the penalty of non-exemption [5].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the payments were made under a mistake of fact, as the Cooperative was unaware of the enactment of R.A. 2023, which was published late in the Official Gazette [4]. Citing American Jurisprudence, the Court held that "a payment of taxes under a mistake of fact has been held not to be voluntary, and is therefore recoverable" based on equity and good conscience [4, 6]. The Cooperative was not negligent as the law involved a change in status [7].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed [7].
