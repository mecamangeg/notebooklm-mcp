I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF JOSE T. UY TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. JOSE T. UY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20799, November 29, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Jose T. Uy filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Negros Oriental on April 18, 1961 [1]. He was single, born in the Philippines, and claimed to be employed as a salesman-cashier at a store owned by his uncle [2]. His reported income was P250.00 per month with free board and lodging, having been increased from P140.00 in 1961 [2]. The trial court granted his application [1]. The Solicitor General appealed the decision, arguing that the trial court erred in finding that the petitioner possessed a lucrative income, a qualification required by law [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner’s income of P250.00 per month constitutes a lucrative trade or profession under the Naturalization Law.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that an income of P250.00 per month, even with free board and lodging, is not a lucrative income or trade within the purview of the Naturalization Law [4]. Although the Court previously held in *Republic v. Lim* (88 Phil. 789) that P250.00 was profitable, it reasoned that the value of the peso has since declined considerably while the cost of living has increased [4]. The Court relied on recent jurisprudence, specifically *Uy v. Republic* (L-20208), where an annual income of P3,600.00 for a single person was not regarded as lucrative [4]. Additionally, the Court noted that the petitioner was not a member of the Social Security System, making his employment with his uncle extremely doubtful or fictitious [5].

The decision appealed from is reversed, with costs against the petitioner [5].
