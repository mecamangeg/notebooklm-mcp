I. CAPTION
HENRY TIONG, ET AL. v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20715, November 27, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Henry Tiong, Robert Tiong, and George Tiu are the legitimate children of Tiong Sim (alias Go Bon King), a Chinese citizen who became a naturalized Filipino on December 15, 1955 [1]. Tiong Sim subsequently obtained a judicial decree changing his name to Daniel C. Go [2]. Because the petitioners were minors when their father was naturalized, the Bureau of Immigration issued identification certificates recording them as Filipino citizens [2]. They filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to annotate their birth certificates to reflect their Filipino citizenship and their father's new name [1, 3]. The CFI granted the petition based on the stipulated facts [1]. The Republic appealed, arguing that Article 412 of the Civil Code only authorizes the correction of clerical errors committed at the time of registration, not substantial changes in status or name brought about by subsequent judicial proceedings [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners may correct their birth certificates under Article 412 of the Civil Code to reflect their citizenship and their father's change of name.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that while Article 412 generally contemplates the correction of clerical errors, the changes sought here are proper because they are not controversial and are supported by indubitable documents [3, 5]. Under Section 15 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 (Naturalization Law), minor children born in the Philippines to naturalized parents are considered citizens [6]. Additionally, Article 407 of the New Civil Code mandates that acts, events, and judicial decrees concerning civil status be recorded in the civil register [6]. Since the facts of the father's naturalization and name change are undisputed, fairness dictates that the corresponding annotations be made to reflect the petitioners' true status and avoid future misunderstanding [3, 7].

The Order appealed from is affirmed [8].
