I. CAPTION
MARIA CRISTINA MANALOTO v. SIXTO L. REYES, Adm. Case No. 503, October 29, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Atty. Sixto L. Reyes served as counsel for the Manaloto family. Petitioner filed a disbarment complaint against him alleging abandonment and conversion. Regarding abandonment, Respondent informed Petitioner in July 1961 that he could not attend scheduled hearings due to an election campaign and proposed a substitute lawyer. Petitioner rejected this, secured a postponement herself, and eventually dismissed Respondent [1, 2]. Regarding conversion, Respondent received P500.00 from Petitioner in January 1961 to stop the public auction of her mother's property. Respondent failed to file any motion or pay the court; the property was sold, and he did not return the money [3, 4]. Additionally, he received P30.00 for a loan filing fee which he never filed nor returned [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Respondent is guilty of abandonment of cases.
2. W/N Respondent is guilty of malpractice for misappropriation of funds.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The charge of abandonment cannot prosper. The Court held that Respondent's proposal to have another lawyer handle the hearings in his absence demonstrated his continued interest in the cases, rather than abandonment [2]. Furthermore, there was no actual hearing to abandon because Petitioner had successfully moved for postponement and subsequently dismissed Respondent [2].

2. **YES.** Respondent is guilty of malpractice. Respondent received P500.00 and P30.00 for specific legal purposes but failed to perform the corresponding services (stopping the auction and filing the loan application) [4, 5]. The Court applied the presumption that since Respondent never returned the amounts involved, he appropriated the same for his own use to the prejudice of, and in violation of the trust reposed in him by, his client [5].

ACCORDINGLY, Respondent Sixto L. Reyes is found guilty of malpractice and is **SUSPENDED** from the practice of law for a period of one year and ordered to return the sum of P530.00 to Petitioner [6].
