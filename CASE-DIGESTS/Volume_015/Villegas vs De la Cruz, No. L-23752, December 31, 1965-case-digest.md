I. CAPTION
SATURNINO LL. VILLEGAS v. VICTORIANO DE LA CRUZ, G.R. No. L-23752, December 31, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Villegas was appointed *ad interim* Justice of the Peace of Guihulñgan, Negros Oriental by President Garcia on December 13, 1961, and took his oath on December 29, 1961 [1]. Upon the entry of the new administration in 1962, he was advised that his appointment was recalled under Administrative Order No. 2 [2]. Villegas ceased to hold office on February 21, 1962, and was replaced by Pacifico S. Bulado [3, 4]. Although the Commission on Appointments confirmed Villegas' appointment in April 1962, Bulado refused his demand to turn over the office in May 1962 [3]. Respondent De la Cruz subsequently took over the position from Bulado on September 15, 1964 [3]. On November 4, 1964, Villegas filed this original petition for *quo warranto* before the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for *quo warranto* is barred by the statute of limitations.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The action is barred. The Supreme Court ruled that an action for *quo warranto* involving the right to an office must be instituted within one year from the time the cause of action arose [5, 6]. Petitioner was dispossessed of his office on February 21, 1962, but only filed the petition on November 4, 1964, long after the one-year period had lapsed [6]. The Court cited *Unabia v. City Mayor*, holding that persons claiming a right to an office must take immediate steps to recover it, otherwise, they are considered to have abandoned their right [7]. The rationale is that public interest requires the title to a public office be determined as speedily as possible to avoid continued uncertainty [4, 5].

Petition is **DENIED** [8].
