I. CAPTION
CU BIE, MARY SYDECO, CONCHITA SYDECO HAUTEA, assisted by her husband JOSE HAUTEA and RAMON MILITANTE, in his own behalf and as legal Guardian of his minor children NENITA, ELENITO and RAMONITO all surnamed MILITANTE and MARAINDAS T. MALVANI v. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, SALVACION SYDECO, accompanied by her husband JOSE TAYENGCO and ROBERTO H. TIROL, G.R. Nos. L-17294 & L-17385, November 29, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners (Cu Bie, et al.) and respondent Salvacion Sydeco were co-owners of a land in Iloilo. In a partition case filed by Salvacion, the parties agreed to sell the property at public auction to the "highest bidder for cash."

During the auction on August 10, 1955, Atty. Jose Hautea (representing petitioner Conchita Sydeco-Hautea) bid P40,500.00. However, he failed to pay the full amount in cash when demanded by the Sheriff, offering only P8,100.00 (representing Salvacion's 1/5 share) and arguing that as co-owners, they need not pay the full price. The Sheriff gave him until 3:00 PM to pay the full amount. When Hautea failed to return with the money, the Sheriff conducted a new auction. Respondent Roberto H. Tirol won the second auction with a bid of P12,000.00, which he paid in cash.

The Court of First Instance set aside the first sale, confirmed the sale to Tirol, but ordered petitioners to pay Salvacion damages (the difference in price). The Court of Appeals affirmed the sale to Tirol but removed the award of damages.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Sheriff properly annulled the petitioners' bid and conducted a resale despite their claim that as co-owners they were not required to pay the full cash amount.
2. W/N the sale to Tirol should be set aside for inadequacy of price.
3. W/N the petitioners are liable for the deficiency in price (damages) resulting from the resale.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Sheriff acted correctly because the specific agreement between the parties approved by the court required the sale to be "for cash." If a sale is made by the Sheriff for cash and the bidder fails to make immediate payment, the Sheriff may sell the property anew on the same day without readvertising. The petitioners' reliance on *Matias v. Provincial Sheriff* is misplaced because, unlike an execution creditor, the terms here were governed by a specific "cash" agreement. Furthermore, one of the co-owner petitioners (Ramon Militante) was representing minors who were not authorized by the court to purchase real estate.

2. **NO.** Inadequacy of price is not a sufficient ground for setting aside a sale unless it is "shocking to the conscience" and there is a showing that a better price can be obtained in the event of a resale. The Court found that P12,000.00 was not shockingly inadequate compared to previous jurisprudence (e.g., property worth P60,000 sold for P25,000).

3. **NO.** Partition sales become valid and binding only upon confirmation by the court. Before such confirmation, bids are mere offers to purchase, and the contract is incomplete (Art. 1326, Civil Code). Consequently, if the property is resold before the confirmation of the first sale, the original purchaser (petitioners) cannot be held in default or liable for the deficiency upon resale.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
