I. CAPTION
FRANCISCA PUZON v. MARCELINO GAERLAN, EMMA VILLANUEVA and ROSALINA GUNDRAN, G.R. No. L-19571, December 31, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Francisca Puzon and Marcelino Gaerlan were married in 1944 but separated in 1958 due to estranged relations. Puzon filed a civil case in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Baguio against Gaerlan and his lessees to determine the spouses' rights over rentals from a conjugal building. During the pre-trial conference, the parties entered into a compromise agreement. On September 15, 1960, the CFI issued an Order embodying the terms of this agreement, wherein Gaerlan agreed to waive all rights to specific conjugal properties (houses in Baguio and Makati, and a department store) in favor of Puzon upon her payment of P35,000.00. Puzon appealed the Order to the Supreme Court, contending that the lower court erred and had no authority to dissolve the conjugal partnership.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Order embodying the compromise agreement is appealable.
2. W/N the Order dissolved the conjugal partnership.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** An order that embodies the terms of a compromise agreement entered into by the parties in the presence of the judge during a pre-trial conference is not subject to appeal. The Court relied on established jurisprudence in *De los Reyes vs. Ugarte* and *Enriquez vs. Padilla* to affirm that such judgments based on compromise are final and unappealable [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The Order did not dissolve the conjugal partnership. It simply provided that upon payment of the fixed sum, the husband waived his rights to the *specific* conjugal properties enumerated in the agreement. Properties other than those listed, as well as properties yet to be acquired by either spouse, were not included in the waiver. Consequently, the conjugal partnership itself was not dissolved by the Order [2-4].

Appeal dismissed [5].
