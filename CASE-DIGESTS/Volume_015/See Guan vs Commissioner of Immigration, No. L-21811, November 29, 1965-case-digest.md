I. CAPTION
SEE GUAN, for himself and in behalf of his wife LU LAI FU and minor daughters SEE SIOK CHENG and SEE SIU HUA v. THE COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION, G.R. No. L-21811, November 29, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, claimed to be the wife and daughters of See Guan, arrived in the Philippines on May 21, 1960, as temporary visitors and posted cash bonds [1]. Their stay was extended multiple times until they sought another extension on September 3, 1962 [1]. The Commissioner of Immigration denied this request on September 11, 1962, ordering them to leave by September 18, 1962, under threat of deportation and bond forfeiture [1]. See Guan, who had secured a judgment for naturalization but had not yet taken his oath, filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [2]. He sought to compel the Commissioner to allow the visitors to remain until he received his certificate of naturalization [2]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the visitors' right to stay had expired [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Commissioner of Immigration may be compelled by mandamus to extend the period of a temporary visitor's stay in the Philippines.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal, holding that the Commissioner of Immigration has no ministerial duty to grant a petition for extension of an alien's stay [1]. Consequently, mandamus will not lie to compel such an act [1]. Similarly, certiorari does not lie because, in the absence of an extension order by the Commissioner, the aliens' right to stay expired on September 18, 1962 [1]. It then became the Commissioner's "bounden duty" to proceed against the visitors and their bonds [1].

The Court further reasoned that See Guan's judgment for naturalization did not impose a duty upon the Respondent to extend the visitors' stay [4]. Moreover, under Section 9 of the Immigration Act of 1940, an alien admitted as a non-immigrant cannot change their status without first departing from the Philippines [5]. Additionally, See Guan ultimately failed to take his oath of allegiance due to insufficient knowledge of English and Tagalog, and he failed to prove his alleged relationship with the visitors during the proceedings [6, 7]. The decision appealed from is affirmed [7].
