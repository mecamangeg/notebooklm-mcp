I. CAPTION
AMADO C. TIGNO and FLORA M. TIGNO v. SILVESTRE PINGOL, RIZALINA REYES-PINGOL, DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES and the CITY OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-18652, September 14, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Spouses Pingol filed a foreclosure suit (Civil Case No. 30773) against Petitioners Spouses Tigno involving a second mortgage. The Tignos admitted the mortgage but raised the defense of usury. However, they failed to present evidence during the hearing. The trial court rendered a summary judgment ordering the Tignos to pay, which became final as no appeal was taken. The property was sold at public auction to the Pingols. The Tignos appealed the order confirming the sale to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-14749), again raising the usury issue, but the Court ruled it was too late as the main decision was already final. Subsequently, the Tignos filed the present complaint (Civil Case No. 45675) seeking to declare the mortgage *void ab initio* due to usury and to recover damages for having sold the property to a third party at a loss to avoid losing it to the Pingols. The lower court dismissed the complaint on the ground of *res judicata*.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the present action for annulment of mortgage and damages is barred by *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the Tignos' complaint is barred by prior judgment. The issue of usury had already been raised in the foreclosure suit (Civil Case No. 30773) and the appeal from the confirmation of sale (G.R. No. L-14749). The Court reiterated the principle that a final judgment is conclusive not only as to every matter offered to sustain the claim but also as to any other admissible matter that might have been offered for that purpose. A party cannot escape the operation of *res judicata* by varying the form of the action or adopting a different method of presenting the case [1, 2].

Furthermore, the Tignos' claim for damages—arising from their voluntary sale of the property to third parties (Cornistas) while the case was pending—depends entirely on whether the foreclosure was proper. Since the validity of the foreclosure and the sheriff's sale had already been determined in the previous litigation, this claim is also barred [3].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED, with treble costs against appellants.
