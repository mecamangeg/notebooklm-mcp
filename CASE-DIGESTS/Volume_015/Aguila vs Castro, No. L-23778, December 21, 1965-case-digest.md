I. CAPTION
MANUEL M. AGUILA v. REMIGIO CASTRO and MAYOR JOSE T. FORTUS, G.R. No. L-23778, December 21, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Manuel Aguila, possessing only third-grade civil service eligibility, was appointed Chief of Police of Ibaan, Batangas in 1954 [1]. Over the years, he received several promotional appointments authorized as "temporary" under Section 24(d) of Republic Act No. 2260, subject to replacement by an appropriate civil service eligible [1]. His appointment on November 29, 1962, was attested by the provincial treasurer but was never forwarded to the Commissioner of Civil Service for review [2]. His last appointment on August 1, 1963, was explicitly "temporary" [1].

On June 25, 1964, while Aguila was on sick leave, Respondent Mayor Fortus terminated his services effective June 30, 1964, due to his lack of appropriate eligibility for a permanent position [3]. Respondent Remigio Castro, a second-grade civil service eligible and war veteran, was appointed to the position effective July 1, 1964 [3, 4]. Aguila filed an original action for *quo warranto* and *mandamus* before the Supreme Court, claiming his 1962 appointment gave him permanent status and that Castro's appointment was void as the office was not vacant [2, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner Aguila acquired a permanent status as Chief of Police such that his removal was illegal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that Aguila did not acquire permanent status because his eligibility (third-grade) was insufficient for a permanent appointment as Chief of Police [2]. Furthermore, under Section 20 of Republic Act No. 2260, attestations by provincial treasurers are subject to revision by the Commissioner of Civil Service within 180 days [2]. Since Aguila's November 1962 appointment was never forwarded to the Commissioner, it remained subject to review and could not ripen into a permanent appointment [2].

Aguila's tenure at the time of his termination was based on the August 1, 1963 appointment, which was expressly "temporary" and "until replaced by an appropriate civil service eligible" [6]. As a temporary appointee, he could be removed from office at any time (*Tolentino v. Torres*; *Mendenilla v. Onandia*) [6]. Conversely, Respondent Castro possessed the appropriate second-grade eligibility and his appointment was duly confirmed by the municipal council [4].

The petition was **DISMISSED** and the writ denied [7].
