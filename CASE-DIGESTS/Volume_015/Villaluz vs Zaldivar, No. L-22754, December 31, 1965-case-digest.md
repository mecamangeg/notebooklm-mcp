I. CAPTION
RUBEN A. VILLALUZ v. CALIXTO ZALDIVAR, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22754, December 31, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ruben A. Villaluz was appointed as Administrator of the Motor Vehicles Office (MVO) in 1958. In 1960, Congressman Joaquin R. Roces informed the President via letter of alleged mismanagement and graft in the MVO. After Villaluz explained his side, the Executive Secretary suspended him, and an investigating committee was formed. Based on the committee’s report, the President issued Administrative Order No. 332 removing Villaluz from office. Villaluz filed a petition for reinstatement, arguing that only the Commissioner of Civil Service had jurisdiction to investigate him and that the proceedings were irregular because the charges were not sworn to. Respondents argued the President has jurisdiction over presidential appointees and that *motu proprio* proceedings do not require verification [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the President has the jurisdiction to investigate and remove the MVO Administrator, a presidential appointee.
2. W/N the administrative proceedings were valid despite the lack of a verified complaint.
3. W/N the petition for reinstatement is barred by laches.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The MVO Administrator, being a presidential appointee, belongs to the non-competitive or unclassified service [4]. Under Section 5 of Republic Act No. 2260, the "power to remove is inherent in the power to appoint" [5]. Consequently, the Commissioner of Civil Service is without jurisdiction, as his authority to pass upon suspension or removal is limited to permanent officials in the classified service [6]. The President retains the power to remove appointees in the unclassified service [7].

2. **YES.** The proceedings were valid. Since the administrative proceedings were commenced by the Chief Executive (petitioner's immediate administrative head) *motu proprio*, a previous verified complaint is not required pursuant to Executive Order No. 370, series of 1941 [8-10].

3. **YES.** The petition, which partakes of the nature of *quo warranto*, was filed more than one year after the cause of action accrued. The Court held that a delay of slightly over one year constitutes laches or abandonment of office [11].

Petition denied [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Zaldivar, J., took no part [12].
