I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SEBASTIAN LARGO, G.R. No. L-18175, July 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On or about midnight of December 2-3, 1957, in Zamboanga City, Patrolman Abdulatip Abdurahim responded to a commotion near a night market. He encountered the accused, Sebastian Largo, holding a dagger and a scabbard. Despite the officer being in uniform, Largo refused to surrender the weapon and warned the officer not to approach, forcing Abdurahim and another patrolman to physically disarm him. The dagger was smeared with fresh blood. Nearby, the lifeless body of Martin Mundido was found with stab wounds.

Witness testimony established that while the victim was engaged in a fistfight with Largo's brother, Federico, Largo suddenly appeared from behind and stabbed Mundido. Largo claimed he merely picked up the dagger during the commotion and did not recognize the officer, but the trial court rejected this defense given the officer's uniform and witnesses identifying the weapon as belonging to Largo. The Court of First Instance of Zamboanga City convicted Largo of murder but sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty of only 8 years and 1 day to 14 years and 8 months. Largo appealed to the Court of Appeals, which forwarded the case to the Supreme Court because the penalty should be life imprisonment.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the crime committed is murder qualified by treachery.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The crime is murder qualified by treachery. The Supreme Court held that treachery is present when the victim is stabbed from behind while busy defending himself from the fist blows of another assailant (in this case, the appellant's brother) [1-3]. This mode of attack ensures the execution of the crime without risk to the offender arising from the defense the offended party might make.

As there were no other modifying circumstances, the penalty for murder must be imposed in its medium period. The Supreme Court modified the lower court's decision, increasing the penalty to life imprisonment [3, 4].
