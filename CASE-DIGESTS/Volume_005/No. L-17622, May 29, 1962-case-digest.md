I. CAPTION
FERNANDO UY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17622, May 29, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Fernando Uy, a citizen of Nationalist China born in Tuguegarao, Cagayan, applied for naturalization. He claimed to be an employee of Cagayan Times Trading (a business owned by his parents) with a monthly salary of P140 and shares in the business worth P5,000. He completed his primary education in Tuguegarao and attended high school in Manila. Character witnesses testified to his good conduct while he was in Tuguegarao but admitted they did not see him while he was studying in Manila, observing him only during vacations. The Court of First Instance of Cagayan granted the petition. The Republic appealed, arguing that Uy lacked a lucrative income and that his witnesses were incompetent.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a monthly salary of P140 constitutes a lucrative trade or profession under the Naturalization Act.
2. W/N the character witnesses were competent to testify on the petitioner's conduct during his entire residence in the Philippines.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A salary of P140 a month is not sufficient to constitute a lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation within the meaning of Section 2 of the Naturalization Act (Commonwealth Act No. 473). The Court relied on its previous ruling in *Velasco v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-14214). Additionally, the Court noted that since the petitioner was employed by his parents, the lack of supporting evidence like business books or records—beyond his own testimony—failed to convincingly prove he was actually working and receiving said salary.

2. **NO.** The witnesses were deemed incompetent because they could not testify to the petitioner's conduct while he was studying in Manila. Since they only saw him in Tuguegarao and during vacations, they were not in a position to observe his behavior during a significant period of his residence. A petitioner must prove irreproachable conduct during the *entire* period of his residence in the Philippines.

The decision of the lower court is **SET ASIDE** and the petition for naturalization is **DENIED**.
