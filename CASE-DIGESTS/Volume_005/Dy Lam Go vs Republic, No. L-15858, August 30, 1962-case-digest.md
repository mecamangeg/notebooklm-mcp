I. CAPTION
DY LAM GO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-15858, August 30, 1962, Padilla, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Dy Lam Go sought to become a Filipino citizen by naturalization. The trial court denied his petition on the ground that he failed to prove he conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during his residence in the Philippines [2]. Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that certificates from various government agencies (Police, Fiscal, NBI, etc.) sufficiently established his good conduct [2].

Upon review of the records, the Supreme Court found that the petitioner is a salesman at Acme Utensil Factory with an average annual income of P3,000 [3]. He is married to a Chinese citizen and has four children [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner meets the lucrative income requirement under the Revised Naturalization Law. [4]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that an average annual income of P3,000 is not considered "lucrative" for an applicant who is married with four children [4, 5].

Even assuming the trial court erred regarding the character witness requirement, the petitioner still fails to qualify because his income does not satisfy Section 2, Paragraph 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 (Revised Naturalization Law), as amended by Republic Act No. 530 [4, 5]. The Court relied on the rulings in *Koa Gui v. Republic* and *Keng Giok v. Republic* to support this conclusion [4].

The petition for naturalization and the motion for reconsideration are **DENIED** [6].
