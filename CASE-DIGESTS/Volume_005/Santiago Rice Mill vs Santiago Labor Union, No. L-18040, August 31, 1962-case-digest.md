I. CAPTION
SANTIAGO RICE MILL, ET AL. v. SANTIAGO LABOR UNION alias MAGAT LABOR UNION, G.R. No. L-18040, August 31, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Santiago Labor Union, composed of workers of petitioner Santiago Rice Mill, filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) for overtime pay, differentials, and later, reinstatement of laid-off workers. The company argued the CIR lacked jurisdiction because the union failed to specifically allege that the labor dispute was "likely to cause a strike or lockout," a requirement under Commonwealth Act No. 103. The CIR Trial Judge dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction and merit. However, the CIR en banc reversed this decision, ordering the company to pay the claims and reinstate the workers, finding that the mill actually operated 24 hours a day and that the women winnowers were daily wage earners, not piece-workers. The company appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR has jurisdiction over the case despite the failure to specifically allege that the labor dispute is likely to cause a strike or lockout.
2. W/N the factual findings of the CIR regarding the hours of operation and nature of employment are supported by substantial evidence.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The CIR has jurisdiction. The Supreme Court held that while the petition did not explicitly aver that the dispute was likely to cause a strike or lockout, this fact was "clearly deducible" from the factual allegations regarding the company's interference with union activities, malicious prosecution of leaders, and dismissal of workers [1]. Additionally, under Republic Act No. 875 (Magna Carta of Labor), enacted while the case was pending, the CIR retains jurisdiction over claims arising from the Minimum Wage Law or Eight-Hour Labor Law where the employer-employee relationship exists or is sought to be reestablished through a petition for reinstatement [2].

2. **YES.** The factual findings of the CIR are binding. The Court affirmed that findings of fact by the CIR are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence [3]. The SC upheld the CIR's evaluation that the workers' testimony regarding the mill's 24-hour daily operation and the daily wage status of women winnowers was more reliable than the company's books and conflicting evidence [4-7].

Resolution affirmed.
