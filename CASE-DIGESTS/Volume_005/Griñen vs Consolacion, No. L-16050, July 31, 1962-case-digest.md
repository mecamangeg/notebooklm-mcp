I. CAPTION
MANUEL GRIÑEN v. FILEMON R. CONSOLACION, as Iloilo City Fiscal, and PHILIPPINE CHARITY SWEEPSTAKES OFFICE, G.R. No. L-16050, July 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Manuel Griñen, a former cashier of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO), was subjected to a preliminary inquiry by Respondent Iloilo City Fiscal. The investigation was initiated based on an unsworn letter from the PCSO Auditor requesting a determination of Griñen's liability for accepting a check with "no account" from a salesman [1, 2]. Griñen filed a petition for Prohibition with Preliminary Injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo to restrain the Fiscal from proceeding, arguing that the Fiscal lacked jurisdiction because the complaint was not sworn to [3]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the letter-complaint was a sufficient basis for the investigation [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the City Fiscal has the authority to conduct a preliminary investigation based on an unsworn letter-complaint.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the pertinent provisions of the Rules of Court and the Revised Administrative Code (Sec. 1687) do not require criminal charges lodged with the Fiscal to be sworn to [6, 7]. What must be sworn to is the complaint or information presented in court *after* the preliminary inquiry has been conducted [8]. The Fiscal has the inherent power to initiate an investigation to determine if a crime has been committed without waiting for a sworn complaint from a police agency or aggrieved party, unless the offense is one that cannot be prosecuted *de oficio* [8, 9]. The Court cited *Hernandez v. Albano* to support this ruling [8]. Furthermore, the Court reiterated the general rule that criminal prosecution generally cannot be the subject of prohibition or injunction as it is vested with public interest [5]. The decision appealed from is affirmed [10].
