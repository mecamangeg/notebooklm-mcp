**I. CAPTION**
PHILIPPINE RABBIT BUS LINES, INC. v. VILLAPANA, ET AL., No. L-17317, August 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
On May 20, 1959, the Motor Vehicles Office (MVO) issued a circular stating that negotiable certificates of indebtedness for backpay holders could not be used by assignees to pay registration fees [1]. Petitioner Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc. (PRBL) had paid its 1959 fees using such assigned certificates [1]. Subsequently, the MVO required PRBL to replace these certificates with cash and ordered the withholding of PRBL's 1960 number plates until the 1959 obligation was settled [2].

Although PRBL paid the 1960 registration fees in cash to the Provincial Treasurer of Tarlac, the MVO Registrar refused to release the 1960 certificates and plates [3]. PRBL filed a petition for mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Tarlac to compel the release of the 1960 plates and prayed for a preliminary mandatory injunction [4]. The CFI issued the injunction, allowing PRBL to operate, and eventually rendered a decision granting the petition [4, 5]. Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petition for mandamus to compel the issuance of the 1960 registration certificates and number plates has become moot and academic.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the purpose of the petition—to compel the MVO to deliver the 1960 registration certificates and number plates—had been "substantially accomplished" with the issuance of the preliminary mandatory injunction by the lower court [6, 7]. Since PRBL had been able to operate its buses unhampered from March 1, 1960, due to the injunction and the fact that 1960 fees were duly paid, the case had become moot and academic [7].

Consequently, the appeal and the petition were **dismissed**, and the writ issued by the lower court was dissolved [8]. The dismissal was without prejudice to the respondents' right to recover the 1959 registration fees in an appropriate separate action [8].
