I. CAPTION
FELICIANO VERGARA v. CIRIACO VERGARA, G.R. No. L-17524, May 18, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
The land in question was originally owned by Martin Vergara, the father of petitioner Feliciano and respondent Ciriaco. Martin applied for registration of the land, placing it in the names of both Feliciano and Ciriaco as co-owners under Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 53147 [1]. In 1936, a portion was sold to Maxima Bancod. In 1956, Ciriaco executed an affidavit of confirmation of subdivision, signing "for himself and in behalf of his co-owner Feliciano" without the latter's consent [2]. Consequently, a Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) for the remaining unsold portion was issued solely in Ciriaco's name [3].

Feliciano, a long-time resident of Manila, was unaware that the land was registered in their names or that Ciriaco had secured a title solely in his own name until shortly before filing the complaint [4]. He filed an action for reconveyance. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan dismissed the complaint, ruling that Feliciano was estopped by laches for having slept on his rights for around 20 years, citing *Lucas v. Gamponia* [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Feliciano's action for reconveyance is barred by laches.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, holding that the doctrine of laches did not apply because the essential elements were not present.

The Court reiterated the four elements required for laches to bar a registered owner's right, as established in *Go Chi Gun v. Co Cho*: (1) conduct by the defendant giving rise to the complaint; (2) delay in asserting rights despite knowledge and opportunity; (3) lack of knowledge by the defendant that the plaintiff would assert the right; and (4) injury to the defendant if relief is granted [6].

The Court found that the second element was absent because Feliciano lacked knowledge of the registration and Ciriaco's fraudulent acts due to his residence in Manila [7]. Delay caused by lack of knowledge cannot constitute laches. The third element was also absent because Ciriaco, knowing the property was co-owned (evidenced by his signing on Feliciano's behalf), should have anticipated the suit [2]. Finally, the fourth element was missing because returning one-half of the property would not prejudice Ciriaco, as he never owned that share [2].

The decision was reversed, and Ciriaco was ordered to execute a deed of conveyance for one-half of the property in favor of Feliciano [8].
