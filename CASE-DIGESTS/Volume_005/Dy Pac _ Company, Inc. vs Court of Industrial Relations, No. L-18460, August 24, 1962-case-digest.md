I. CAPTION
DY PAC & COMPANY, INC., petitioner, vs. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and DY PAC PAKIAO WORKERS' UNION, respondents, G.R. No. L-18460, August 24, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Dy Pac & Company, Inc. (Company) is a lumber business operating "carros" (sawing machines). One machine was operated by laborers under the supervision of A. Santos Soriano, whom the Company claimed was an independent contractor [1]. In November 1956, these laborers formed the respondent Union. In January 1957, the Union demanded wage increases compliant with the Minimum Wage Law. Shortly after, work on the machine stopped. The Company claimed Soriano had terminated his contract [1]. When operations resumed under Soriano's son, the Union members were refused readmission for being "troublesome" [1].

Evidence showed that Soriano hired workers subject to the Company's approval, the Company paid the wages, and the laborers signed the Company's payroll [1]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found Soriano was merely a "dummy" or agent of the Company and that the work stoppage was an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) due to union activities. It ordered backwages without reinstatement [1, 2]. The Company moved for a new trial claiming it could not locate Soriano to testify, which the CIR denied [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N A. Santos Soriano was an independent contractor.
2. W/N the Company is liable for Unfair Labor Practice.
3. W/N the motion for new trial based on the failure to locate a witness should be granted.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A. Santos Soriano was not an independent contractor but merely an agent of the Company. The Court held that one who hires workers subject to the approval of the company, which pays their wages, is not an independent contractor [1]. The fact that laborers were made to sign the Company's payroll further negated independent contractor status. The Court cited *Madrigal Shipping Co., Inc. vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission* and *Asia Steel vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission* in support of this finding [1, 3].

2. **YES.** The unjust dismissal of the workers constitutes an Unfair Labor Practice. Since Soriano was an agent, his acts are attributable to the Company. The Court affirmed that the stoppage of work was due to the workers' union activities, specifically their demand for minimum wages [1, 3].

3. **NO.** The motion for new trial was properly denied. A motion based on fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence due to a missing witness must be supported by an affidavit stating what the witness would testify to and that the result would probably be different [3]. The Company failed to submit such an affidavit and failed to show reasonable diligence in notifying Soriano of the trial date [3].

**Petition denied. Decision affirmed.**
