I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LUIS M. TARUC, G.R. No. L-14010, May 30, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On December 6, 1944, Feliciano B. Gardiner (Governor of Tarlac during the Japanese occupation) and three companions were stopped in Apalit, Pampanga by members of the Hukbalahap. They were taken to appellant Huk leader Luis Taruc on December 7 at his barracks in San Luis, Pampanga. Taruc accused Gardiner of persecuting socialists and ordered the execution of Gardiner and his companions. Following this order, the victims were taken to a "matadero" and clubbed to death with bamboo [1-4].

An information for illegal detention with murder was filed in 1946, later amended to kidnapping with robbery and multiple murder [5]. The prosecution discharged accused Delfin Balagtas to serve as a state witness under the original information [6, 7]. During trial, the court also allowed the recall of witness Leoncio Santos for additional questions [8]. The Court of First Instance convicted Taruc as principal by induction and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Taruc appealed, claiming defects in the witness discharge, lack of *corpus delicti*, violation of double jeopardy, and entitlement to amnesty under Proclamation No. 8 [7-11].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the discharge of a state witness under the original information is valid for subsequent amended informations.
2. W/N the recall of a prosecution witness violates the rule on double jeopardy.
3. W/N *corpus delicti* was sufficiently proven despite the lack of identified bodies.
4. W/N the accused is entitled to amnesty under Proclamation No. 8.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Amended informations are not new informations but a continuation of the previous one. Consequently, a discharge secured under the original information is just as binding upon subsequent amended informations [7, 12].

2. **NO.** The recall of a prosecution witness to answer additional direct questions is allowable provided the prosecution has not yet closed its evidence and the case has not been submitted to the court for final judgment. Such recall does not constitute a violation of the rule on jeopardy [8].

3. **YES.** *Corpus delicti* was sufficiently established by the testimony of a witness who described in detail how the victims were stripped of their clothes and attacked one by one with bamboo sticks until they died. There could be no better proof of *corpus delicti* than such positive testimony [10].

4. **NO.** The defense of amnesty under Proclamation No. 8 cannot be invoked where the evidence shows the liquidation of the deceased was ordered not because of collaboration with the Japanese, but due to his pre-war activities regarding the prosecution of socialists (the Timbol brothers). Mere holding of a government position during the occupation does not justify liquidation under the amnesty proclamation [11].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [13].
