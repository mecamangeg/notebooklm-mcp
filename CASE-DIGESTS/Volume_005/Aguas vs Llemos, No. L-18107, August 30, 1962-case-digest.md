I. CAPTION
**MARIA G. AGUAS, FELIX GUARDINO and FRANCISCO SALINAS v. HERMOGENES LLEMOS, deceased defendant substituted by his representatives, PERPETUA YERRO-LLEMOS, HERMENEGILDO LLEMOS, FELINO LLEMOS and AMADO LLEMOS, G.R. No. L-18107, August 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.**

II. FACTS
On March 14, 1960, plaintiffs Aguas et al. filed an action for damages in the Court of First Instance of Samar against Hermogenes Llemos. They alleged that Llemos maliciously served them a copy of a petition for a writ of possession with notice of a hearing on February 23, 1960. Plaintiffs traveled from Manila to Samar with their lawyers for the hearing, but Llemos failed to file the petition or appear, causing them unnecessary expenses and mental anguish [1].

Before answering, Llemos died on April 1, 1960. Plaintiffs amended the complaint to substitute his heirs. The heirs filed a Motion to Dismiss, which the lower court granted on the ground that the legal representative, not the heirs, should be the defendant, and that since the action was for money, it should be filed in the estate proceedings [2]. Plaintiffs appealed on points of law, arguing that the action arises from tort and survives the defendant's death [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for damages based on malicious conduct causing unnecessary expenses survives the death of the defendant.

IV. RULING
**YES.** (The Court affirmed the legal principle, though the appeal was dismissed for being moot).

The Court found "considerable cogency" in the plaintiffs' argument that the action survives. Under Rule 87, Section 5, actions abated by death are claims for funeral expenses, money judgments, and claims for money "arising from contract express or implied" [3]. This phrase includes purely personal obligations other than those arising from delict or tort (*Leung Ben v. O'Brien*) [3, 4].

Conversely, Rule 88, Section 1 lists actions that survive: (1) recovery of real/personal property; (2) enforcement of liens; and (3) recovery of damages for an injury to person or property [5]. The Court held that "injury to property" is not limited to damage to specific goods but extends to other wrongs that diminish the personal estate (*Baker v. Crandall*). Maliciously causing a party to incur unnecessary expenses is an injury to that party's property (*Javier v. Araneta*) [5]. Thus, the action is tortious in nature and survives.

However, since the parties arrived at an amicable settlement approved by the lower court, the case became moot [6].

**Appeal dismissed.**
