I. CAPTION
FLORENCIA PICCIO VDA. DE YUSAY, TERESITA P. YUSAY, MARILOU YUSAY DE HOSTILLAS and JOSELITO P. YUSAY, surviving heirs substituting for the late JOSE YUSAY v. LILIA POLI YUSAY-GONZALES, G.R. No. L-14990, July 31, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
The petitioners (heirs substituting the late Jose Yusay) filed Civil Case No. 4091 in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo to annul a previous order that declared respondent Lilia Yusay-Gonzales an acknowledged natural child of the late Matias Yusay. The trial court rendered judgment dismissing the complaint and ordering petitioners to pay the respondent P20,000.00 in damages and P5,000.00 in attorney's fees. The petitioners filed a notice of appeal praying that the case be forwarded to the Court of Appeals. However, the trial court forwarded the appeal to the Supreme Court, seemingly under the impression that the case fell within the exception of Section 17, paragraph 5 of the Judiciary Act (R.A. No. 296) because of a previous related case (*Yusay v. Yusay-Gonzales*, G.R. No. L-11378) involving identical parties.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that it lacked jurisdiction and the case properly belonged to the Court of Appeals. Under Sections 17 and 29 of the Judiciary Act (R.A. No. 296), as amended, the Supreme Court has exclusive appellate jurisdiction when the value in controversy exceeds P200,000.00 or when only questions of law are raised. Here, the total amount involved is only P25,000.00, and there is no showing that the appeal raises purely questions of law.

The Court further ruled that the case does not fall under the exception in Section 17 regarding cases involving the "same evidence." The evidence in the previous case (L-11378), which concerned the proper share of inheritance (50 hectares vs. more), is different from the evidence required in the present case, which concerns the annulment of an order of recognition based on fraud.

Appeal certified to the Court of Appeals for determination and judgment.
