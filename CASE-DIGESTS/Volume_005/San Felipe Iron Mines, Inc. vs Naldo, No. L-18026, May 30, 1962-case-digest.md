I. CAPTION
SAN FELIPE IRON MINES, INC. v. JOSE A. NALDO, et al., G.R. No. L-18026, May 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On February 6, 1958, Teofilo P. Paano and others filed a complaint against San Felipe Iron Mines, Inc. with the Department of Labor, Regional Office No. 3, Manila, for recovery of overtime pay and separation pay. The hearing officer rendered judgment in favor of the claimants, and the Regional Administrator issued a writ of execution under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A.

San Felipe Iron Mines, Inc. filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Manila to annul the award and the writ, contending that the Regional Office had no authority to decide the case because Reorganization Plan No. 20-A was unconstitutional. The trial court upheld the validity of the Plan and dismissed the petition. San Felipe Iron Mines, Inc. appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is valid insofar as it confers jurisdiction over money claims to regional offices of the Department of Labor.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is null and void insofar as it confers judicial power upon regional offices of the Department of Labor over money claims other than those falling under the Workmen's Compensation Act.

Citing *Equitable Banking Corp. v. Regional Office 3* and *Corominas, Jr. v. Labor Standard Commission*, the Court held that it was not the intention of Congress in enacting Republic Act No. 997 to deprive the courts of jurisdiction over money claims and transfer them to the regional offices of the Department of Labor. Consequently, the decision and writ of execution issued by the Regional Office were declared illegal and void.

The appealed judgment of the Court of First Instance was set aside.
