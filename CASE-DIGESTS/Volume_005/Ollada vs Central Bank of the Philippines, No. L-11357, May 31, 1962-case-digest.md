I. CAPTION
FELIPE B. OLLADA vs. CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-11357, May 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Felipe B. Ollada, a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), challenged the requirement of the Central Bank (CB) Import-Export Department that CPAs must submit to accreditation under oath to certify financial statements for import dollar allocations. Ollada filed a petition for Declaratory Relief in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, claiming the requirement invaded the Board of Accountancy's jurisdiction and was unconstitutional [1, 2].

The CB filed a motion to dismiss. During the proceedings, the CB modified the objectionable features of the accreditation forms (CB-IED Forms No. 5 and 6) [3, 4]. Consequently, the CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the elimination of the objectionable features made the petition for declaratory relief groundless [5]. Ollada appealed, arguing that despite the modifications, his rights had already been violated and he had suffered injury due to the CB’s unlawful restraint on his practice [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for declaratory relief is proper when the petitioner alleges that a right has already been breached or violated.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that a complaint for declaratory relief will not prosper if filed after a contract, statute, or right has been breached or violated [7, 8].

The Court noted that the petitioner himself vigorously claimed that the respondent Central Bank had "already invaded or violated his right and caused him injury" [7]. Such allegations constitute a complete cause of action enforceable in an appropriate ordinary civil action, rather than a special civil action for declaratory relief [7]. Citing *De Borja vs. Villadolid* and *Samson vs. Andal*, the Court reiterated the doctrine that an action for declaratory relief should be filed *before* there has been a breach; once a breach occurs, the remedy is an ordinary action, as declaratory relief is proper only if adequate relief is not available through other existing forms of action [7].

The order of dismissal was affirmed, and the preliminary injunction previously issued was set aside [9].
