**I. CAPTION**
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. EMITERIO VILLANUEVA, PEDRO PERGAL and FELIX JASMILONA**, G.R. No. L-12687, July 31, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
On December 21, 1955, accused Emiterio Villanueva assaulted Loreto Estacio, prompting the latter to file a criminal complaint. Villanueva attempted to settle the case, but Estacio refused, leading Villanueva to threaten that "something untoward would happen" to him [1]. On December 27, 1955, Estacio disappeared. Witnesses saw him walking with Villanueva and accused Pedro Percal (or Pergal), while others saw Percal and accused Felix Jasmilona heading toward Villanueva’s *taklab* (camarin), where groans were later heard [2, 3]. Estacio’s body was found four days later in a marsh with hematomas and a stab wound [4, 5].

The Court of First Instance of Laguna convicted the three accused of murder, sentencing them to *cadena perpetua* [6]. The conviction relied heavily on Jasmilona’s extra-judicial confession detailing the crime, corroborated by circumstantial evidence, such as human blood found in the *taklab* and Villanueva’s wife attempting to wash a blood-stained pestle [4, 7]. Jasmilona later retracted, claiming the confession was coerced through torture [5]. The accused appealed, challenging the admissibility of the confession and the sufficiency of evidence [6, 8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N Jasmilona’s extra-judicial confession was voluntary and admissible.
2. W/N the extra-judicial confession is admissible against co-accused Villanueva and Percal.
3. W/N there was conspiracy among the accused.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The confession was voluntary. The Court rejected the claim of maltreatment because the prosecution’s doctor found no external injuries on Jasmilona merely a day after a defense doctor claimed to have seen them [9]. Furthermore, Jasmilona did not complain of any abuse to the Justice of the Peace when he signed and swore to the affidavit, even after the soldiers were ordered to leave the room [10, 11].

2. **YES.** While the general rule is that an extra-judicial confession is binding only upon the confessant, it may be considered against co-accused when the recitals are corroborated in important details by other proofs in the record [8]. Additionally, the Court cited *People v. Manalo*, noting that when a defendant testifies for his co-defendants—as Jasmilona did, with Villanueva and Percal adopting his testimony and statement as their defense—the confession becomes competent evidence to contradict said testimony [12].

3. **YES.** Conspiracy exists where the acts of the accused show the killing was planned and carried out in concert [13]. Although there was no direct proof of the agreement, the chain of circumstances regarding the accused's movements and the concealment of the crime, fitting tightly with the extra-judicial confession, established the conspiracy [14].

**Judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED, with the penalty modified to *reclusion perpetua*.** [15]
