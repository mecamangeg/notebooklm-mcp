I. CAPTION
INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED CLODUALDO VITUG, DONATA MONTEMAYOR v. HEIRS OF EDUARDO D. GUTIERREZ, G.R. No. L-16959, July 24, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Donata Montemayor, the administratrix of the Intestate Estate of Clodualdo Vitug, contracted the legal services of Atty. Eduardo D. Gutierrez. Following the lawyer's death, his heirs (appellees) sought payment for the professional services rendered. The estate of Clodualdo Vitug had already been distributed to his heirs. In a previous decision, the Supreme Court exempted Montemayor from personal liability and ruled that the lawyer's heirs should demand payment directly from the heirs of Vitug. The Heirs of Gutierrez filed a Motion for Reconsideration, seeking to modify how the fees should be collected [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the administratrix is responsible for the payment of attorney's fees after the estate has been distributed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court modified its previous decision on the Motion for Reconsideration. The Court reasoned that because the administratrix contracted the counsel's services, she is indirectly responsible to the appellees for the payment of the fees [1]. Accordingly, Montemayor is declared responsible, **in her capacity as administratrix**, to the Heirs of Gutierrez for the adjudged fees. However, given that the estate has been distributed, the Court granted her the corresponding duty and right to secure the necessary sums from the heirs of Clodualdo Vitug, who are held responsible in proportion to the shares they received [2].
