I. CAPTION
MARCELINO T. MACARAEG and ASUNCION V. SISON-MACARAEG v. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, G.R. No. L-15915, May 26, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, spouses Macaraeg, had a subsisting loan with respondent Philippine National Bank (PNB) secured by a real estate mortgage incurred prior to June 20, 1953 [1]. On December 20, 1955, the spouses offered to pay the remaining balance of P9,500.00 using a Backpay Certificate of Indebtedness issued by the Bureau of Treasury [1]. PNB refused to accept the certificate, citing Republic Act (R.A.) No. 1576, which prohibited the bank from accepting such certificates for payment [1]. The spouses filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan to compel PNB to accept the payment and to return interest paid after the tender [1]. The CFI ruled in favor of the spouses, ordering PNB to accept the certificate [2]. PNB appealed, arguing that under Section 9-A of R.A. No. 1576, effective June 16, 1956, it had no authority to accept backpay certificates [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N PNB is obliged to accept the backpay certificate as payment for the loan.
2. W/N interest on the loan should continue to accrue after the date of tender.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** PNB must accept the certificate. R.A. No. 897, approved on June 20, 1953, expressly allowed the payment of pre-existing debts to government-owned corporations like PNB using backpay certificates [4]. This law was in force from June 20, 1953, until June 16, 1956, when R.A. No. 1576 was enacted to prohibit such acceptance [4]. Since the petitioners' debt subsisted prior to June 20, 1953, and they made a valid tender of payment on December 20, 1955—while R.A. No. 897 was still in effect and before the enactment of R.A. No. 1576—they were entitled to pay their obligation using the backpay certificate [4, 5].

2. **NO.** Interest does not accrue after a valid tender of payment. The Court held that since there was a valid tender of payment made by the spouses on December 20, 1955, no interest on the balance of the loan should accrue from that date [1, 6]. PNB was ordered to return the interest paid by petitioners covering the period after the tender [6].

The judgment of the CFI is AFFIRMED [6].
