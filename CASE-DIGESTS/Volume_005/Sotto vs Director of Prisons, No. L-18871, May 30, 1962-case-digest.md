I. CAPTION
EDUARDO SOTTO v. THE DIRECTOR OF PRISONS and THE SUPERINTENDENT, SAN RAMON PRISON & PENAL FARM, ZAMBOANGA CITY, G.R. No. L-18871, May 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Eduardo Sotto was convicted of robbery by the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga upon a plea of guilty. He was sentenced to imprisonment of 12 years and 1 day to 18 years, 2 months, and 21 days of *reclusion temporal*. He commenced serving his sentence on December 17, 1953 [1]. On December 8, 1958, after serving an aggregate term of 4 years, 11 months, and 21 days, Sotto filed a petition for *habeas corpus* [1]. He alleged that the penalty imposed was excessive and illegal, arguing that the proper penalty should have been based on Article 302 rather than Article 299 of the Revised Penal Code. Furthermore, he claimed that as a 16-year-old minor at the time of conviction, he was entitled to a lower penalty which he had already fully served [1, 2]. The respondents argued that even if the sentence was erroneous, *habeas corpus* was not the proper remedy [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a writ of *habeas corpus* is the proper remedy to correct an alleged erroneous sentence imposed by a court with jurisdiction.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that when a court has jurisdiction over the offense charged and the person of the accused, its judgment is valid and not subject to collateral attack by *habeas corpus* [3]. The writ cannot be made to perform the function of a writ of error, and this applies even if the judgment or decree was erroneous [4, 5].

In this case, the trial court undoubtedly had jurisdiction over the cause, the person of the accused, and the power to impose the penalty provided by law [6]. Any mistake regarding the appreciation of facts or law constitutes a mere error of judgment correctible only by appeal, not by *habeas corpus* [6, 7]. The Court distinguished this case from *Cruz v. Director of Prisons* (17 Phil. 269) and *Caluag v. Pecson* (82 Phil. 8), where the writ was allowed because the penalties imposed were not provided by law and were thus beyond the trial court's jurisdiction [8, 9].

The writ is denied, and the decision appealed from is affirmed [6].
