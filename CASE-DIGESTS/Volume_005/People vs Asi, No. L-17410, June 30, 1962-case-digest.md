I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RUPERTO ASI, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17410, June 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On December 19, 1955, at around midnight in Bongabon, Oriental Mindoro, appellant Fortunato Aro, together with Ruperto Asi and two others, all armed, entered the house of Santos Claveria [1]. While Santos escaped, Aro threatened his wife, Esmenia Querubin, and obtained P1,000.00 [2]. Aro then dragged their 17-year-old daughter, Araceli, outside where she was raped successively by the four men [2]. Co-accused Asi pleaded guilty, but Aro pleaded not guilty and interposed the defense of alibi, claiming he was in Batangas during the incident [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance of Oriental Mindoro convicted Aro of robbery in band with rape, sentencing him to *reclusión perpetua* and ordering him to indemnify Esmenia [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over the positive identification by the victims.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court rejected the defense of alibi, describing it as self-serving, biased, and uncorroborated by credible evidence [6]. The victims positively identified Aro, whom they knew well prior to the crime, and had no improper motive to falsely incriminate him [6].

The Court affirmed the penalty of *reclusión perpetua* considering the aggravating circumstances of nighttime and band [7]. However, the decision was modified regarding civil liability. Citing *People v. Feliciano* and Article 345 of the Revised Penal Code, the Court ordered Aro to pay P4,000.00 as damages to the rape victim, Araceli Claveria, in addition to the P1,000.00 indemnity to her mother [7].

**Disposition:** Decision MODIFIED.
