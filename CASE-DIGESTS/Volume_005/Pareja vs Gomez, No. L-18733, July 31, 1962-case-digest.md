I. CAPTION
FELIPE B. PAREJA v. THE HON. AMADOR E. GOMEZ and THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18733, July 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On July 3, 1961, Attorney Antonio Abad Tormis was shot and killed in Cebu City [1, 2]. Following the incident, police executed a search warrant on the office of petitioner Felipe B. Pareja, the City Treasurer of Cebu, and discovered the murder weapon—a Colt revolver—inside one of his safes [2]. The search was predicated on information that Cesario Orongan committed the murder at the behest of Avelino Monzolin, acting on behalf of Pareja who supplied the gun [2]. Pareja was charged with murder qualified by treachery and attended by five aggravating circumstances, including evident premeditation and consideration of a reward [3]. Pareja moved for bail, but the prosecution objected, citing the capital nature of the offense and strong evidence of guilt [4]. Respondent Judge Gomez denied the bail application, ruling that the prosecution's evidence, if unimpeached, would warrant a conviction [5]. Pareja filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that the evidence against him was purely circumstantial and failed to meet the requirements for conviction under Section 98, Rule 123 of the Rules of Court (now Rule 133, Section 4), and that his voluntary surrender reduced the probability of the death penalty [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the requirements for sufficiency of circumstantial evidence for conviction apply to the determination of the right to bail in capital offenses.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that Section 98 of Rule 123 of the Rules of Court is not decisive in connection with the constitutional right to bail in capital offenses [6]. That section governs the quantum of evidence essential for **conviction**, for which guilt must be established **beyond reasonable doubt** [6]. In contrast, to deny the constitutional right to bail in capital offenses, it is sufficient that the **evidence of guilt be strong** [6]. The Court found that the facts established by the prosecution were such that reasonable men might honestly disagree on whether the petitioner should be released, and thus the respondent Judge did not commit grave abuse of discretion in denying bail [7]. Furthermore, the Court noted that voluntary surrender is generally insufficient to offset the five aggravating circumstances alleged in the information [8].

The writ prayed for was denied and the petition dismissed [7].
