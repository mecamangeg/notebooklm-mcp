I. CAPTION
UNITED STATES RUBBER CO. v. MEDINA, G.R. No. L-17153, May 18, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff United States Rubber Co. filed a complaint in the Municipal Court of Manila against defendant Mariano Medina to collect P500.00, representing the unpaid balance for tires and tubes purchased on November 2, 1954, under Invoice No. 39371 [1]. Medina denied the debt and claimed overpayment. The Municipal Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff [1].

On appeal to the Court of First Instance (CFI), the plaintiff amended its complaint to state the purchase was "under an open account" [2]. During trial, Medina objected to evidence showing an unpaid balance existed *prior* to the November 2, 1954 invoice, arguing this was not alleged in the complaint [3]. The CFI overruled the objections, allowing plaintiff to prove that payments made after the invoice date were applied to the prior balance, leaving P500.00 still due on Invoice No. 39371 [3, 4]. After trial, the court admitted a second amended complaint to conform to the evidence and rendered judgment for the plaintiff [4]. Medina appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court properly admitted evidence of the prior unpaid balance and allowed the amendment of the complaint to conform to said evidence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the evidence of the outstanding unpaid balance prior to November 2, 1954, was well within the material allegations and theory of the first amended complaint, which specifically noted the transaction was "under an open account" [5]. The Court explained that this evidence merely demonstrated the manner of computation adopted to arrive at the P500.00 balance due and did not change the plaintiff's theory [6].

Furthermore, even if the evidence had changed the theory of the case, the Court ruled that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the second amendment after the trial to make the allegations conform to the evidence [7]. Citing the Rules of Court, the Court emphasized that amendments should be freely allowed to subserve the ends of justice when the objecting party fails to show prejudice to their defense on the merits [7, 8]. As Medina undoubtedly owed the balance and relied only on a technicality, the amendment was proper [8].

The judgment is affirmed [9].
