I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. DIONISIO MENDIOLA, G.R. No. L-14207, May 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On February 3, 1958, a complaint for the complex crime of serious physical injuries and damage to property through reckless imprudence was filed against Pedro Capuno in the Justice of the Peace Court (JPC) of Sariaya, Quezon [1]. The damage alleged was a fracture to a horse's leg, with the horse valued at P320.00 [2, 3]. The Respondent Judge (JPC) set the case for trial on the merits [1]. The Provincial Fiscal objected, arguing the JPC lacked jurisdiction and should only conduct a preliminary investigation as the case fell under the Court of First Instance (CFI) [1, 4]. When the JPC overruled the objection, the Fiscal filed a petition for prohibition with the CFI of Quezon [4]. The CFI denied the petition, reasoning that the damage was merely a fractured leg (evaluated at 1/4 of the horse's value), bringing the amount within the JPC's jurisdiction [2]. The Fiscal appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Justice of the Peace Court has jurisdiction over a complex crime of serious physical injuries and damage to property where the damage amounts to P320.00.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the case falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance [5, 6]. First, the Court corrected the valuation of damages, holding that a horse with a broken leg is useless for its ordinary occupation; thus, the damage is the total value of the animal, P320.00 [3].

Second, citing *People v. Villanueva* and *Angeles v. Jose*, the Court held that the information cannot be split into separate charges for physical injuries and damage to property because they result from a single act constituting a complex crime [6, 7]. Under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code, the fine imposable for the damage to property, combined with the penalty for physical injuries, exceeds the jurisdiction of the inferior court [6].

The order appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the case is remanded to the court *a quo* for further proceedings [8].
