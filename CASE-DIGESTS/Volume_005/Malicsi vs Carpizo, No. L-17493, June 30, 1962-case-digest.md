I. CAPTION
ALBERTO E. MALICSI v. ROSALIA A. CARPIZO, Administratrix of the Estate of Tan Cuan, G.R. No. L-17493, June 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On April 6, 1951, plaintiff Alberto Malicsi and Tan Cuan entered into a Contract of Lease for a period of 17 years covering a lot in Zamboanga City. Tan Cuan died in May 1955, and defendant Rosalia Carpizo, as administratrix of his estate, continued paying the monthly rentals. However, Carpizo failed to pay the rentals for January and February 1958. Malicsi filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zamboanga City for the rescission of the contract and payment of unpaid rentals.

Carpizo admitted the lease but denied default, claiming entitlements from other collections. The CFI rendered judgment in favor of Malicsi, cancelling the lease and ordering Carpizo to vacate the premises and pay the accrued rentals. Carpizo appealed directly to the Supreme Court, arguing that a lease is not one of the contracts declared rescissible under Article 1381 of the Civil Code and that the claim for unpaid rentals should have been filed as a money claim against the estate.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the contract of lease is subject to rescission for non-payment of rentals.
2. W/N the action for rescission and recovery of rentals was properly instituted against the administratrix instead of as a claim against the estate.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that **Article 1659 of the Civil Code** expressly provides that if the lessee fails to comply with the obligation to pay the rental, "the aggrieved party may ask for the rescission of the contract and indemnification for damages." Furthermore, Paragraph 5 of **Article 1381 of the Civil Code** includes "all other contracts specially declared by law to be subject to rescission." Since the appellant failed to pay the stipulated rental, the appellee had the right to bring an action for rescission.

2. **YES.** The action was properly brought against the administratrix. **Section 1, Rule 88 of the Rules of Court** provides that actions to recover real or personal property from the estate may be commenced against the executor or administrator. The Court found that the action was primarily to rescind the lease and recover possession of real property, and only secondarily to recover rentals. Additionally, money claims against an estate under Rule 88 are limited to those accruing *before* the decedent's death. Since the rentals in question accrued in 1958—after Tan Cuan's death in 1955—they could not be properly filed as claims against the estate.

The decision of the lower court is affirmed.
