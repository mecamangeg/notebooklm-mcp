**I. CAPTION**
MARIANO CORPUZ v. BENJAMIN PADILLA, G.R. Nos. L-18099 and L-18136, July 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
The subject property is Lot 4, a rice land in Laur, Nueva Ecija, originally owned by Sixto Domingo and inherited by his son, Pedro Domingo [1]. In 1956, Benjamin Padilla purchased the land from Pedro. Shortly after, Mariano Corpuz (petitioner) filed a complaint for Forcible Entry against Padilla in the Justice of the Peace Court, claiming ownership based on a 1937 Deed of Sale executed between his father, Mariano Corpuz, Sr., and Pedro Domingo [2, 3]. The JP Court ruled in favor of Corpuz. Padilla appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) and subsequently filed an application for land registration over the same property [2, 4].

The CFI consolidated the cases. Corpuz opposed the registration, arguing that his father acquired Lot 4 via the 1937 Deed or through acquisitive prescription, having possessed it since 1925 [5, 6]. The 1937 Deed stated that Corpuz, Sr. recognized Pedro’s claim over a 2-hectare portion included in Corpuz's existing Title (Lot 2) and expressly acknowledged that Lot 4 belonged to Pedro ("*lote 4 sa plano na akin namang kinikilala na kanya*") [7]. The CFI confirmed Padilla's title and dismissed Corpuz's claim, ruling that the 1937 sale only transferred the portion overlapping with Lot 2, not Lot 4 [3]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision [8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner acquired ownership of Lot 4 through the 1937 Deed of Sale or acquisitive prescription.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' findings.

Regarding the Deed of Sale, the Court held that the instrument was clear: Corpuz, Sr. expressly admitted that Lot 4 belonged to Pedro Domingo. The sale was limited to the rights over the 2-hectare portion already included in Corpuz, Sr.'s own title (Lot 2), which Pedro claimed [9].

Regarding prescription, the Court ruled that the petitioner’s claim of continuous possession was negated by his father's admission in the 1937 Deed recognizing Pedro Domingo's ownership. The Court applied the principle that **one cannot recognize the right of another and at the same time claim adverse possession which can ripen to ownership through acquisitive prescription** [10]. For prescription to set in, possession must be adverse, continuous, public, and to the exclusion of all; these circumstances were absent because the petitioner acknowledged the respondent's predecessor's rights [10].

The decision appealed from was affirmed [10].
