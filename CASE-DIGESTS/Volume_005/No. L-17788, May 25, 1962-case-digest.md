I. CAPTION
LUIS RECATO DY, ET AL. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17788, May 25, 1962, 5 SCRA 89, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Nemecio Sedano was employed as a driver for Oas Victory Rice Mill, operated by petitioners Luis Recato Dy and Jose Recato Dy, from 1946 until his dismissal on January 15, 1960. He was dismissed because he was about to testify against his employers in a pending case before the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). Sedano filed a petition with the CIR praying for reinstatement, back wages, and overtime pay. The employers moved to dismiss the petition, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction because the petitioners did not number more than 30 and there was no threatened strike or lockout, as previously required by Commonwealth Act No. 103. The CIR initially granted the motion but, upon reconsideration, issued a resolution asserting its jurisdiction. The employers appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over the case despite the number of employees being 30 or less and the absence of a threatened strike or lockout.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the requirements of Section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 103—specifically that a petition must be filed by more than 30 employees and involve a dispute likely to cause a strike or lockout—no longer hold true following the enactment of Republic Act 875.

Citing the doctrine in *Paflu v. Tan* and *PRISCO v. CIR*, the Court ruled that as long as the dispute involves a claim for reinstatement combined with claims relating to the Eight-Hour Labor Law or Minimum Wage Law, the industrial court has jurisdiction regardless of whether the number of petitioners is 31 or less, or whether the dispute is likely to cause a strike. To rule otherwise would curtail the CIR's jurisdiction and defeat the purpose of the Magna Carta of Labor.

The Resolution of the respondent court is affirmed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Padilla, J., concurred in the result.
