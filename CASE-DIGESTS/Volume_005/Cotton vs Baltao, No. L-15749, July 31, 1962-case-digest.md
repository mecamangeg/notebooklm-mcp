I. CAPTION
JOSEPHINE COTTON, ET AL. v. EUGENIO S. BALTAO, G.R. No. L-15749, July 31, 1962, Regala, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Defendant-appellant Eugenio S. Baltao filed a motion in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court to modify its judgment dated August 31, 1956 in Civil Case No. 28836 [2]. Specifically, Baltao requested to be given until 1961 to deliver 5,000 shares of stock to plaintiffs-appellees Josephine Cotton, et al., and to discharge the mortgage on said shares [3]. The lower court denied the motion, prompting Baltao to appeal to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appellant should be granted an extension until 1961 to deliver the shares and discharge the mortgage. [3]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the question has become moot and academic [3]. The Court reasoned that the specific period requested by the appellant—until 1961—had already expired by the time the Court issued its resolution in July 1962 [3]. Therefore, rendering an opinion on the matter would have no practical effect. The appeal is dismissed [3].
