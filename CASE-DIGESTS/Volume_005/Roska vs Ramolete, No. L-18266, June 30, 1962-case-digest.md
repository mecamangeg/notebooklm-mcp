I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO ROSKA and APOLONIA CAUSING ROSKA v. HON. MODESTO R. RAMOLETE, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Cebu, and FORTUNATA GABRINTINA, G.R. No. L-18266, June 30, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
The Cebu Fire Damage Commission filed an action for interpleader with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu regarding the fire damage claims of Fulgencio Banico Kho. On December 10, 1960, the trial court issued an order based on a compromise agreement apportioning the creditors' allotments. Subsequently, respondent Gabrintina filed a motion to amend the apportionment to increase her share. On December 17, 1960, respondent Judge Ramolete issued an order amending the apportionment, reducing petitioners' (Roskas) share and increasing Gabrintina's. Petitioners received this order on December 24, 1960, and filed a motion for reconsideration (MR) the same day. The MR was denied on January 9, 1961, and petitioners received the denial on January 11, 1961. Petitioners filed their Notice of Appeal on January 12, 1961, and their Record on Appeal on February 10, 1961. However, the respondent Judge dismissed the appeal on March 9, 1961, upon motion by Gabrintina. Gabrintina argued that the appeal was not perfected because petitioners failed to furnish her a copy of the Record on Appeal on the day of filing and that petitioners waived their right to appeal by withdrawing the originally allotted amount. Petitioners filed a petition for mandamus to compel the Judge to approve the appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appeal was filed within the reglementary period.
2. W/N the petitioners' withdrawal of the deposited amount constituted a waiver of their right to appeal.
3. W/N the failure to furnish the adverse party with copies of the appeal documents on the same day warrants the dismissal of the appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The appeal was filed on time. The petitioners received the order denying their motion for reconsideration on January 11, 1961. Under Section 1, Rule 28 of the Rules of Court, the 30-day period to appeal commenced on January 12, 1961, and would expire on February 10, 1961. Since the Record on Appeal was filed on February 10, 1961, it was within the statutory period [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The withdrawal of funds did not constitute abandonment or waiver. The amount withdrawn was the sum originally allotted to petitioners, not the reduced amount stated in the appealed amendatory order. Furthermore, petitioners expressly manifested that the withdrawal was to protect their rights and interests, promising to return the money if other creditors did the same [3].

3. **NO.** Section 3 of Rule 41 requires the appellant to serve the adverse party with copies of the notice of appeal, appeal bond, and record on appeal. However, the Court held that non-compliance with this requirement is not a ground for dismissal if it does not impair the substantial rights of the adverse party. Citing *Arcega v. Dizon* and *Philippine Resources Development Corporation v. Narvasa*, the Court ruled that in such cases, the requirement is merely directory, and the court's discretion should be guided by the interest of justice. There was no showing that Gabrintina's rights were adversely affected [4-6].

Petition is granted, and the respondent Judge is ordered to give due course to petitioners' appeal.
