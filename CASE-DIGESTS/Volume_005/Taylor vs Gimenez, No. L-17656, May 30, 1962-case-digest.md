I. CAPTION
**EDUARDO TAYLOR v. PEDRO M. GIMENEZ, in his capacity as Auditor General of the Philippines, and JUAN O. CHIOCO, in his capacity as Administrator of Economic Coordination**, G.R. No. L-17656, May 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Eduardo Taylor served as the manager of the Cebu Portland Cement Company (CEPOC), a government corporation, until his retirement on January 31, 1955, after 30 years of service [1]. Prior to his retirement, the CEPOC Board of Directors passed Resolution No. 735 granting him a bonus of P12,000.00 as a "special gesture of appreciation" for his long service [1].

Respondent Administrator of Economic Coordination, with the concurrence of respondent Auditor General, disapproved the resolution on the grounds that the grant was: (1) in excess of the gratuity allowed under Section 28(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 186; and (2) an injudicious and extravagant expenditure that would set a bad precedent [2]. Taylor petitioned for relief, arguing that the bonus was not a gratuity but a payment for services and that the amount was minimal compared to the company's profits [3, 4]. Respondents maintained that the disapproval was a valid exercise of the Administrator's supervision over government corporations under Executive Order No. 386 [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court can alter or modify the Administrator of Economic Coordination's decision to disapprove the petitioner's bonus.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Administrator of Economic Coordination acted within his authority, and the Court may not interfere with his discretion absent a showing of abuse.

Under Republic Act No. 422 (Reorganization Act of 1950) and Executive Order No. 386, the Administrator is empowered to supervise government-owned corporations to ensure efficiency and economy [6, 7]. Furthermore, Executive Order No. 399 (Uniform Charter for Government Corporations) specifically provides that the power of Boards of Directors to approve budgets is "subject to the final action of the Administrator of Economic Coordination" [7].

The Administrator disapproved Resolution No. 735 on grounds of injudiciousness and extravagance to carry out the purpose of the reorganization law [8]. Since this action was an exercise of executive discretion involving policy and there was no showing of abuse, it is beyond judicial competence to review [8, 9].

Petition dismissed [10].
