I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF KHO ENG POE TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. KHO ENG POE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17146, July 20, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On March 6, 1958, Kho Eng Poe filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cotabato [1]. He presented evidence that he had resided in the Philippines continuously since 1938 and possessed the necessary qualifications [2]. The CFI granted the petition, declaring him a Filipino citizen [3]. The Republic appealed the decision. Although the Solicitor General initially moved to withdraw the appeal, the Supreme Court denied the motion and required the submission of a brief to review the petitioner's qualifications [4]. The central objection on appeal focused on the sufficiency of the testimony provided by the petitioner's character witnesses [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner and his witnesses sufficiently proved that he does not possess any of the disqualifications for naturalization under Commonwealth Act No. 473.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. It is incumbent upon a petitioner for naturalization to prove affirmatively, by his own testimony and that of at least two credible witnesses, not only that he possesses all the qualifications required under Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, but also that he does not possess any of the disqualifications provided under Section 4 of the same Act [5, 6].

The Court found the testimony of the character witnesses, Jose S. Lim and Jose de la Rosa, to be manifestly insufficient [5]. Witness Lim merely testified that the petitioner was not disqualified "because he possesses all the qualifications," which the Court ruled does not constitute affirmative proof of the absence of disqualifications [7]. The Court emphasized that possessing qualifications is distinct from not possessing disqualifications [7]. Because the petitioner failed to affirmatively prove the absence of disqualifications through credible witnesses, the petition was **DENIED** [8, 9].
