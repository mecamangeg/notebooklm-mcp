I. CAPTION
**JOSE V. NERI v. LIBRADO C. LIM**, G.R. No. L-17529, July 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Jose V. Neri sued Defendant Librado C. Lim to recover P17,823.13 representing commissions for the sale and lease of Lim's properties in Masbate. Lim filed an answer denying liability, asserting his obligation was merely "moral," and filed a counterclaim [1, 2]. The case was set for hearing on February 2, 1960, but Lim failed to appear. Neri was allowed to present evidence *ex parte*, and on February 22, 1960, the trial court rendered a decision ruling in favor of Neri [2, 3].

Lim filed a motion to set aside the decision on June 22, 1960, claiming he never received notice of the hearing or the decision due to illness requiring hospitalization from February 22 to March 29, 1960. However, the record showed that notice of the hearing was sent by registered mail on December 4, 1959, but was returned unclaimed on January 8, 1960, despite three notices from the postmaster. The copy of the decision sent on March 4, 1960, was also returned unclaimed despite notices sent on March 7, 15, and 22. The trial court denied the motion, noting Lim's consistent pattern of ignoring registered mail even before his illness [4, 5]. Lim appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in denying the motion to set aside the decision based on the defendant's failure to receive notice.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. A defendant's motion to set aside a decision should be denied when the failure to receive a copy thereof is attributable to his own fault [6]. The Court found that Lim's failure to claim his mail was a consistent "pattern of conduct" demonstrating an utter disregard for ordinary prudence [5]. His excuse of illness was insufficient because notices for the hearing were sent prior to his hospitalization, and the decision was returned unclaimed after he had been discharged. Furthermore, his failure to authorize someone to receive his mail aggravated his fault rather than mitigating it [5].

Additionally, the Court held that the motion was properly denied because the record did not indicate that Lim had a good defense. He failed to submit an affidavit of merit or intimate the nature of his proof. His defense that the obligation was merely "moral" actually suggested that the plaintiff's allegations were substantially correct [7].

**Decision and order affirmed.**
