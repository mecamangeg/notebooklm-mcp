I. CAPTION
NATIONAL FEDERATION OF SUGARCANE PLANTERS, ET AL. v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15423, June 22, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On March 10, 1959, the Federation of Free Farmers (Union) filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against the National Federation of Sugarcane Planters (Petitioners) for payment of wages, certification election, differential pay, and unfair labor practices. Petitioners filed a motion to dismiss based on lack of jurisdiction and insufficiency of the petition. While the motion was pending, the Union requested to set the hearings in various towns of Antique province where the laborers resided. The CIR deferred action on the motion to dismiss until after the trial on the merits, noting the grounds were not indubitable, and granted the Union's request to hold hearings in different towns. Petitioners objected, claiming prejudice and inconvenience, and arguing the court should first resolve the jurisdictional issue. When their objection was overruled, Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court alleging grave abuse of discretion.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR committed grave abuse of discretion in deferring the motion to dismiss and setting the hearings in various towns.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the CIR.

Regarding the motion to dismiss, the Court ruled that the CIR properly deferred action because the grounds cited by Petitioners (specifically regarding jurisdiction) did not appear to be "indubitable" [1, 2]. The Court noted that most movants had already answered the petition and that evidence was necessary to substantiate the grounds for dismissal; thus, a joint hearing with the merits was appropriate to avoid duplicity of trial [2].

Regarding the venue, the Court held that setting hearings in different towns of Antique would not cause prejudice or inconvenience to the Petitioners [1]. The record showed that most Petitioners had haciendas and houses in the province, the distances between the towns were short, and there were good roads and available daily transportation [3].

Petition denied. The writ of preliminary injunction is dissolved.
