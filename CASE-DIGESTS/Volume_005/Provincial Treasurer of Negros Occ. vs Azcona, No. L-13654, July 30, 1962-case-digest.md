I. CAPTION
PROVINCIAL TREASURER AND PROVINCIAL ASSESSOR OF NEGROS OCCIDENTAL v. JOSE AZCONA, et al., G.R. No. L-13654, July 30, 1962, 5 SCRA 634, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Between 1948 and 1953, Victoria Milling Co., Inc. paid taxes on its machineries under protest based on assessments by the Provincial Assessor of Negros Occidental [1, 2]. These assessments became final as the company did not appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals [2]. On April 24, 1953, the company filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental against the provincial collection officials, seeking a higher depreciation rate for its machineries and a refund of overpayments [3].

While the case was pending, Republic Act No. 1125 was enacted on June 17, 1954, creating the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [4]. Despite this, the CFI continued with the case and rendered a decision on January 24, 1956, ruling in favor of the company and ordering a refund [4, 5]. The decision ostensibly became final due to the Provincial Fiscal's failure to file an appeal brief, leading the CFI to issue a writ of execution in October 1957 [6]. The petitioners filed a petition for certiorari to nullify the decision and the writ, arguing the CFI had lost jurisdiction [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance retained jurisdiction to decide the pending disputed assessment case after the enactment of Republic Act No. 1125.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court of First Instance lost jurisdiction, and its decision is null and void.

The Supreme Court held that the provisions of Section 22 of Republic Act No. 1125 are mandatory [7]. This section requires that all cases involving disputed assessments pending determination before the Courts of First Instance be certified and remanded to the Court of Tax Appeals for final disposition [7, 8]. The open disregard of this mandatory provision renders the lower court's decision null and void [7, 8].

Although Section 22 explicitly mentions only "Internal Revenue taxes or customs duties," the Court ruled that it must be harmonized with Section 7 of the same Act, which grants the CTA exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all tax, customs, and real estate assessment cases [9]. Citing *Bislig Bay Lumber Company, Inc. v. The Provincial Government of Surigao*, the Court emphasized that the legislative intent was to centralize these cases in the CTA [9]. Consequently, the CFI decision and the subsequent order of execution were set aside, and the case was ordered remanded to the CTA [10].

Petition granted. The decision and order of execution are set aside, and the case is remanded to the Court of Tax Appeals [10].
