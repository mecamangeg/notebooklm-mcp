I. CAPTION
LEONARDO MADRIGAL v. CITY SHERIFF OF MANILA, CITY OF MANILA, and VALERIANO C. BUENO / VALERIANO C. BUENO v. LEONARDO MADRIGAL, HON. JOSE SANCHEZ, and THE SHERIFF OF MANILA, G.R. Nos. L-17766 & L-18486, August 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On September 23, 1958, the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded Leonardo Madrigal P4,000.00 as compensation for injuries sustained while employed by Valeriano Bueno. The WCC subsequently issued a writ of execution and an alias writ to enforce the award. The Sheriff of Manila levied some properties but refused to proceed with the sale due to a pending petition filed by Bueno (Special Civil Case No. 41883) challenging the WCC proceedings.

Madrigal filed a petition for mandamus (Civil Case No. 43102) to compel the Sheriff to proceed with the execution sale, which the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila dismissed. Madrigal appealed this dismissal in G.R. No. L-17766. Meanwhile, Bueno appealed the validity of the WCC award itself in G.R. No. L-18486, claiming he was denied the opportunity to defend himself, though the Court of Appeals found he had ignored WCC notices.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Workmen's Compensation Commission has the authority to issue writs of execution to enforce its awards.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Workmen's Compensation Commission lacks the power to issue writs of execution. Under Section 51 of Act No. 3428, an award of the WCC must be enforced by filing a certified copy with the Court of First Instance of the province where the accident occurred. The court then renders a decree or judgment in accordance with the award, and it is this judicial decree that is enforced via a writ of execution issued by the court, not the Commission.

Although Reorganization Plan No. 20-A purported to vest the WCC with authority to issue writs of execution, the Court ruled that such grant of authority is unconstitutional and beyond the powers conferred by Republic Act No. 997. Consequently, the Sheriff could not be compelled to enforce the void writ issued by the WCC.

The decision in G.R. No. L-17766 (dismissing the mandamus) is **AFFIRMED**. The decision in G.R. No. L-18486 is **AFFIRMED** insofar as it upheld the legality of the WCC's decision on the merits, but **MODIFIED** to reflect that the WCC cannot issue writs of execution.
