I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GUILLERMO MANANTAN, G.R. No. L-14129, July 31, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Guillermo Manantan, a justice of the peace in Pangasinan, was charged with violating Section 54 of the Revised Election Code, which prohibits certain public officers from aiding candidates or influencing elections [1]. Manantan moved to dismiss the information, arguing that he was not covered by the prohibition because Section 54 enumerates "justice, judge, fiscal..." but specifically omits "justice of the peace," unlike previous administrative codes which explicitly mentioned them [1, 2]. The trial court initially denied the motion but later dismissed the case, citing a Court of Appeals ruling (*People v. Macaraeg*) that applied the rule of exclusion to exempt justices of the peace [1]. The Solicitor General appealed the dismissal [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a justice of the peace is included in the prohibition against partisan political activity under Section 54 of the Revised Election Code.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that a justice of the peace is included in the prohibition.

The Court ruled that the term "judge" in Section 54 is a generic and broader term intended to comprehend all kinds of judges, including justices of the peace [4]. A review of the legislative history showed that while the Revised Administrative Code specified "Judge of First Instance" and "justice of the peace," Section 54 of the Revised Election Code used the unmodified word "judge" to broaden coverage, not to exempt justices of the peace [4, 5].

The defense's invocation of *casus omissus pro omisso habendus est* (a person or thing omitted must be held to have been omitted intentionally) was rejected because there was no actual omission, only a substitution of terms [6]. Furthermore, the rule of strict construction for penal statutes must yield to the spirit and clear purpose of the law [7]. Excluding justices of the peace would result in manifest injustice and defeat the legislative intent to ensure judicial impartiality, especially since justices of the peace have jurisdiction over certain election cases [8, 9].

The order of dismissal was **set aside**, and the case was **remanded** to the trial court for trial on the merits [10].
