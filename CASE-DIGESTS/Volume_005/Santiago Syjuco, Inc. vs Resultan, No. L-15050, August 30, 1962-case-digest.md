I. CAPTION
SANTIAGO SYJUCO, INC. v. FELISA RESULTAN, et al., G.R. No. L-15050, August 30, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Justo Resultan, a salesman for petitioner Santiago Syjuco, Inc., died in April 1958. His widow, respondent Felisa Resultan, filed a claim for death benefits. Petitioner did not controvert the claim. On July 29, 1958, the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded the respondents P4,000.00 as death compensation plus burial expenses. This award became final and executory on September 15, 1958.

On October 1, 1958, the WCC issued a writ of execution. The Sheriff of Manila garnished petitioner's bank funds pursuant to the writ. Petitioner filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to enjoin the enforcement of the writ, arguing that the WCC lacked the authority to issue writs of execution. The CFI dismissed the complaint and upheld the writ. Petitioner appealed, raising the issues of the WCC's power to execute judgments and the validity of the lump-sum payment.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the final WCC award may be modified to allow for installment payments instead of a lump sum.
2. W/N the Workmen's Compensation Commission has the power to issue a writ of execution to enforce its awards.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The award had already become final and executory without an appeal being taken; thus, it cannot be modified to change the mode of payment from lump sum to installments. The Court noted that since the award did not specify the mode of payment, it is understood to be payable in a lump sum.

2. **NO.** The Workmen's Compensation Commission has no power to order the execution of its decisions. The authority granted to the WCC under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A was declared unconstitutional for vesting judicial power in the Commission. To enforce an award, the prevailing party must follow Section 51 of the Workmen's Compensation Law, which requires filing a certified copy of the decision in the court of record where the accident occurred, whereupon the court shall render a judgment to be enforced.

The judgment of the lower court is **REVERSED**, the writ of execution issued by the WCC is **VACATED**, and appellees are permanently enjoined from enforcing the same.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
