**I. CAPTION**
**CLEOTILDE LAT v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS and MARCIAL BANZUELA**, G.R. No. L-17591, May 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Marcial Banzuela, administrator of the Intestate Estate of Mariano M. Lat, obtained a favorable judgment from the Court of Appeals (CA) ordering petitioner Cleotilde Lat to deliver P4,700.00 to the estate [1]. When the decision became final, Banzuela filed a motion for execution [2]. Petitioner opposed and moved to quash the writ, presenting an "Agreement of Withdrawal of Appeal" (Exhibit 1) executed by the heirs of the deceased on September 29, 1957, prior to the CA decision [2]. She argued that the heirs had agreed to drop the case and withdraw the appeal, rendering the judgment moot and unenforceable [3]. The administrator, who was not a party to the agreement, objected, arguing no definite settlement was reached [2]. The Court of First Instance denied the motion to quash, ruling that its duty to execute a final judgment was ministerial [2]. The CA affirmed this ruling [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the heirs' agreement to withdraw the appeal prevents the administrator from executing the final judgment in favor of the estate.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The agreement of the heirs does not bind the administrator or the estate. The Supreme Court held that the administrator is not a mere alter ego of the heirs but an officer of the probate court entrusted with the management and settlement of the estate [5, 6]. Until the estate is liquidated and distributed with court approval, the heirs have no right to interfere in its administration [6].

While rights of succession are transmitted from the moment of death (Civil Code, Art. 777), the heirs' participation in specific assets is "purely prospective and contingent" upon the results of the liquidation [6, 7]. Furthermore, the administrator was not a party to the agreement (Exhibit 1) and could not have validly renounced rights under the decision without the probate court's approval [8]. Consequently, the agreement signed only by the heirs cannot annul the judgment awarded to the administrator.

The petition is denied and the decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED** [9].
