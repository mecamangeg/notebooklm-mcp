**I. CAPTION**
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FELIPE ABUY**, G.R. No. L-17616, May 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 21, 1959, in Zamboanga City, accused Felipe Abuy allegedly committed acts against Nicolasa B. de Magadia. On April 1, 1959, an Information for "Trespass to Dwelling" was filed against him [1]. However, on November 5, 1959, the prosecution moved to dismiss this case because the evidence could not sustain a conviction, which the Municipal Court granted [2, 3]. Subsequently, on November 13, 1959, a new Information for "Unjust Vexation" was filed against Abuy based on the same acts committed on February 21 [2, 4]. Abuy moved to quash the second Information on the ground of prescription, arguing that Unjust Vexation is a light offense that prescribes in two months [4, 5]. The Municipal Court granted the motion, and the Court of First Instance affirmed the dismissal [5, 6]. The prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the filing of the first Information for Trespass to Dwelling interrupted the prescriptive period for Unjust Vexation [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the filing of the Information for Trespass to Dwelling interrupted the prescriptive period for the crime of Unjust Vexation.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the filing of the first Information did not interrupt the prescriptive period for the second offense. Under Article 91 of the Revised Penal Code, the period of prescription is interrupted by the filing of the complaint or information [7]. The Court interpreted this to mean the **proper** complaint or information corresponding to the offense committed [7].

In this case, the elements of Trespass to Dwelling are entirely different from those of Unjust Vexation [8]. The two offenses were not related in the informations, except for the identity of the accused and the date [8]. Since the first Information was not the proper charging instrument for the second offense, it did not operate to toll the prescriptive period. Unjust Vexation is a light offense under Article 9(3) of the Revised Penal Code and prescribes in two months under Article 90(6) [5]. Since six months and twenty days had elapsed from the discovery of the crime (February 21, 1959) to the filing of the proper Information (November 13, 1959), the crime had already prescribed [9].

The order of the lower court dismissing the case is **AFFIRMED** [10].
