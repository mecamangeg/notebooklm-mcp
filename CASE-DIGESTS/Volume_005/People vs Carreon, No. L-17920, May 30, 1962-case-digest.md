I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ORLANDO CARREON, G.R. No. L-17920, May 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On February 17, 1960, Orlando Carreon was charged with "Other Light Threats" under Article 285 of the Revised Penal Code in the Municipal Court of Ozamis City for allegedly threatening Manuel M. Mananquil with a sidearm [1, 2]. After trial, the Municipal Court convicted Carreon of "Unjust Vexation" instead of the crime charged, ordering him to pay a fine [3, 4]. Carreon appealed the judgment to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Misamis Occidental [4].

In the CFI, the City Fiscal reproduced the original information for "Other Light Threats" [4]. Carreon filed a motion to quash, arguing that further proceedings would constitute double jeopardy because the Municipal Court's judgment effectively acquitted him of Light Threats, and that the facts charged did not constitute Unjust Vexation [5, 6]. The CFI granted the motion and dismissed the case [5]. The prosecution appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the prosecution of the accused in the Court of First Instance upon his appeal constitutes double jeopardy.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that when an accused unqualifiedly appeals from a sentence of the trial court, he waives the constitutional safeguard against double jeopardy and throws the whole case open to the review of the appellate court [7, 8].

Under Section 8 of Rule 119 of the Rules of Court, when an appeal is perfected, the judgment of the municipal court is vacated, and the case is tried *de novo* in the CFI as if it were originally instituted there [9, 10]. The prosecution may stand on the original information or file a new one charging the same criminal act [10]. Consequently, the CFI proceedings, brought about by Carreon's own appeal, are completely unaffected by the Municipal Court's findings, and he cannot interpose the plea of double jeopardy [11].

The order of dismissal was set aside, and the case was remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings [12].
