I. CAPTION
JOSE ALCANTARA v. DIONISIO YAP, PACIFICO YAP and HON. NICASIO YATCO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Quezon City, G.R. No. L-18530, May 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Dionisio and Pacifico Yap filed a case for recovery of possession and damages against petitioner Jose Alcantara regarding lots in Quezon City. Alcantara claimed ownership by inheritance, arguing the land was outside the respondents' title derived from J.M. Tuason & Co. [1, 2]. The trial court rendered a decision in favor of the Yaps on January 27, 1961 [1, 3].

Alcantara received the decision on February 10, 1961, and filed a "Motion for Reconsideration and New Trial" on February 22, 1961, arguing insufficient evidence and that the decision was contrary to law [3]. The trial court denied this motion. Subsequently, Alcantara filed a notice of appeal and record on appeal on March 17, 1961 [4]. However, the respondent Judge disapproved the record on appeal, ruling that the previous motion for reconsideration was merely *pro forma* and did not toll the period for appeal [5]. Alcantara filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's motion for reconsideration and new trial was *pro forma*.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the motion was not *pro forma* because it complied substantially, if not strictly, with Section 2, Rule 37 of the Rules of Court [6].

The Rule requires a motion for new trial based on insufficient evidence or being contrary to law to "point out specifically the findings or conclusions of the judgment which are not supported by the evidence or which are contrary to law, making express reference to the testimonial or documentary evidence" [6]. The Court found that Alcantara's motion specifically attacked the trial court's findings regarding the boundary lines (specifically the Novaliches Road) and made express references to the transcript of stenographic notes and documentary exhibits to support his claim that the land was unregistered and not covered by the respondents' title [6, 7].

Since the motion was not *pro forma*, it effectively suspended the period for appeal. The petition was granted, the order disallowing the appeal was set aside, and the lower court was directed to approve and give due course to the record on appeal [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Padilla, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., and Dizon, JJ., concurred with the decision [8].
