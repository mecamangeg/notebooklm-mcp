I. CAPTION
REINERIO TICAO, et al. v. HON. ARSENIO NAÑAWA, et al., G.R. No. L-17890, August 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Following the November 10, 1959 elections for Vice-Mayor and Councilors in Iloilo City, the respondents (protestants) filed an election protest against the petitioners (protestees). The protest explicitly impugned the election results in "all the 265 precincts" of the city, alleging gross frauds, terrorism, and coercion [1]. Specifically, Paragraph 9 of the protest listed certain precincts where election inspectors were allegedly illegally changed [1]. In their answer, the petitioners averred that the election in all 265 precincts was clean, peaceful, and honest [2, 3].

During the hearing on December 14, 1960, long after the statutory period for filing protests had lapsed, the respondent Judge allowed the protestants to amend Paragraph 9 by adding 14 precincts to the list [4]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that the Judge acted without jurisdiction because the amendment was substantial and introduced a new ground of protest after the deadline [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the amendment adding new contested precincts constitutes a substantial amendment prohibited after the lapse of the statutory period for filing an election protest.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the amendment was not substantial and did not allege a new ground of protest. Since the original protest clearly assailed the election in "all the 265 precincts" of Iloilo City and the petitioners' answer joined the issue regarding the regularity of the election in the entire city, the validity of the election in all precincts was already squarely in issue [5, 6].

The Court reasoned that the mere addition of 14 precincts to those specifically enumerated did not force the petitioners to face new issues but was merely in the nature of a bill of particulars clarifying the issue properly raised in the original pleading [6]. Citing *Gallares v. Caseñas* and *Cecilio v. Tomacruz*, the Court reiterated that amendments are permissible when they do not change the grounds of the protest or introduce new issues [7, 8]. The petition for certiorari was denied [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Regala and Makalintal, JJ., concurred) [9].
