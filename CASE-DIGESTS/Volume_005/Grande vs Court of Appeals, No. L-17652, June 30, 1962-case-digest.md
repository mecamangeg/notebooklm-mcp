I. CAPTION
IGNACIO GRANDE, ET AL. v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS, DOMINGO CALALUNG, and ESTEBAN CALALUNG, G.R. No. L-17652, June 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners are the registered owners of a parcel of land in Isabela covered by Original Certificate of Title No. 2982, with the Cagayan River as its northeastern boundary [1]. Over time, gradual accretion formed an alluvial deposit of nearly two hectares [2]. In 1958, petitioners filed an action to quiet title and recover possession against respondents, who were occupying the accretion [2]. The Court of First Instance ruled for petitioners, holding that accretion belongs to the riparian owner and, being attached to registered land, is imprescriptible [3, 4]. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that while the accretion belongs to the riparian owner by law, it does not automatically become registered land and is therefore subject to prescription [5, 6]. The CA found that respondents had been in continuous, open, and adverse possession of the accretion since 1934 [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an accretion to registered land automatically becomes registered property and thus imprescriptible.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that an accretion does not automatically become registered land just because the lot which receives it is covered by a Torrens title [9]. While ownership of the accretion belongs to the riparian owner under Article 457 of the New Civil Code (Article 366 of the old Civil Code), ownership is distinct from registration [9]. Registration under the Land Registration Act merely confirms and protects title, making it imprescriptible; however, to obtain this protection, the specific land must be placed under the operation of registration laws [9]. Since petitioners never registered the alluvial deposit, it remained unregistered land subject to acquisition by third persons through prescription [9]. As respondents were in possession since 1934, they validly acquired ownership by acquisitive prescription under Act 190 [10].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED** [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
