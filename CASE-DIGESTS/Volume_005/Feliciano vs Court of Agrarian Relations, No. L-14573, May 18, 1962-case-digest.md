I. CAPTION
CONCEPCION FELICIANO v. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS and AMADO AFABLE, G.R. No. L-14573, May 18, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Concepcion Feliciano filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) to dispossess her tenant, respondent Amado Afable, from his landholding in Meycauayan, Bulacan. She invoked Section 50(a) of Republic Act No. 1199, stating her bona fide intention to cultivate the land personally with the aid of her son and son-in-law. She also alleged non-payment of rentals. The CAR found that while Feliciano complied with the statutory notice requirements, she was aged, sickly, and incapable of manual work. Consequently, the CAR denied her petition, ruling that the right to "personal" cultivation requires the landholder to be capable of doing the farming herself, and delegating it to family members violates the spirit of the law. Feliciano appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a landholder may dispossess a tenant for personal cultivation under Sec. 50(a) of R.A. 1199 if the work will be performed by her son and son-in-law due to her physical incapacity.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CAR decision. The Court ruled that Section 50(a) of R.A. 1199 should not be interpreted literally. A landholder who owns a small parcel of land and wishes to improve their financial condition by taking it back to be farmed by a member of their family (such as a son) falls within the spirit of the law [1, 2]. To deny this would advance the fortune of an outsider (the tenant) to the detriment of a family member [2].

The Court applied the principle from *Saclolo v. CAR*, which allowed a wife-landholder to cultivate through her husband, holding that the same "community of life and interest" exists between a mother and son [3, 4]. Furthermore, since Section 4 of R.A. 1199 allows a tenant to cultivate land with the aid of his "immediate farm household," the protective arm of social justice must extend equally to the landlord [4, 5].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the petitioner is granted authority to dispossess the respondent to cultivate the landholding [5].
