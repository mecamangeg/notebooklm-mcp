I. CAPTION
GUILLERMO VIACRUCIS and LUISA DE VIACRUCIS v. HON. NUMERIANO G. ESTENZO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Leyte, ANASTACIO ORAIS and CELESTINA MALAZARTE, G.R. No. L-18457, June 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Anastacio Orais and Celestina Malazarte filed a complaint for recovery of possession of land against petitioners Guillermo and Luisa Viacrucis [1]. Petitioners moved for an extension of time to answer until they received a copy of the deed of sale ("Annex A") mentioned in the complaint [1]. The trial court granted the motion, giving petitioners 10 days from receipt of the document to file their answer [1].

The postmaster issued the first notice for the registered mail containing the court order and document on January 24, 1961 [1]. Under the Rules of Court, service was deemed complete five days later, on January 29, 1961 [2]. Consequently, the petitioners had 10 days from January 29, or until February 8, 1961, to file their answer [2]. However, on January 31, 1961—before the period expired—Judge Estenzo issued an order declaring petitioners in default [3, 4].

Petitioners actually received the mail on February 6 and filed their answer on February 14 [1, 5]. Meanwhile, the court received evidence *ex parte* and rendered judgment against petitioners on February 15 [5]. Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied, prompting this petition for certiorari [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the order of default issued by the trial court was null and void.
2. W/N the petitioners' failure to file their answer within the reglementary period cured the premature declaration of default.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The order of default was null and void because it was premature [4]. Since service was deemed complete on January 29, petitioners had until February 8 to file their answer [2]. The trial court's declaration of default on January 31 was issued eight days prior to the expiration of the time expressly granted to the petitioners [2]. A declaration of default made before the period to answer has expired is in excess of jurisdiction and deprives the defendant of their day in court [8, 9]. Since the order was inherently defective and void, certiorari was the proper remedy, distinguished from cases of mere mistake or excusable neglect where appeal is appropriate [9, 10].

2. **NO.** A void order cannot be revived or ratified by subsequent acts [11, 12]. Petitioners' failure to answer by February 8 could not validate the void order issued on January 31 [12]. Furthermore, under Section 6, Rule 35 of the Rules of Court, a defendant can only be declared in default "upon motion of the plaintiff" [12]. Since the respondents did not file a new motion to declare petitioners in default after the premature order, the petitioners were never legally in default [12]. Consequently, the *ex parte* reception of evidence and the decision rendered thereafter were also null and void [13].

The petition is granted, the orders and decision of the trial court are set aside, and the case is remanded for further proceedings [13].
