I. CAPTION
GREGORIO AGUILAR Y DE GUZMAN v. HON. FELIPE NATIVIDAD, HON. QUERUBE C. MAKALINTAL and HON. SOTERO CABAHUG, as Appellate Justices of the Court of Appeals, G.R. No. L-17849, August 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Gregorio Aguilar was convicted by the Court of First Instance of Manila of frustrated homicide for stabbing Simeon Dacumos on May 3, 1957. The conviction was based largely on the testimony of Dacumos, who positively identified Aguilar as his assailant. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the conviction. Subsequently, Aguilar filed a motion for reconsideration and/or new trial in the CA, submitting a sworn statement by Dacumos recanting his original testimony. In the affidavit, Dacumos claimed he was unable to recognize his attacker due to darkness and had only identified Aguilar based on police assurances. The CA denied the motion. Aguilar appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the CA erred in denying the new trial based on the newly discovered evidence of recantation.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the recantation of the sole prosecution witness entitles the accused to a new trial.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that a recantation by a prosecution witness does not necessarily entitle the defendant to a new trial; the granting of such depends on all the circumstances of the case (*People v. Follantes*). Testimony given at trial with the solemnities prescribed by law and in the presence of the judge carries a presumption that it was truthful, spontaneous, and freely given (*People v. Cu Unjieng*). Conversely, scant weight is given to sworn statements withdrawing testimony previously accepted as true by the trial judge (*People v. Olfindo*). The Court reasoned that if a new trial were granted every time an interested party induced a witness to vary their testimony, litigation would never end. Even where the recanting witness is the only evidence, a new trial is granted only if special circumstances raise substantial doubt as to the truth of the original testimony (*People v. Dacir*). Here, the recantation was insufficient to raise such doubt, as the lower courts found the victim's identification was positive and aided by street lights.

The order denying the motion for new trial is affirmed.
