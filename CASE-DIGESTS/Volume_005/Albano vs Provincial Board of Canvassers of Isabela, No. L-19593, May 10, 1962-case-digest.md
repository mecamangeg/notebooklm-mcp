I. CAPTION
DELFIN B. ALBANO v. THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF ISABELA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19593, May 10, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Delfin B. Albano and respondent Samuel Reyes were candidates for Representative of the lone district of Isabela. Following the Supreme Court's decision in *Albano v. Arranz* (G.R. No. L-19260), which allowed for a recount, Albano filed a petition for correction and/or judicial recount with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Isabela under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code [1, 2]. The recount was conducted and resulted in the complete confirmation of the allegation that the election returns had been falsified [2]. However, instead of declaring the result, the respondent CFI dismissed the petition on the ground that Albano failed to present evidence that the recount would affect the result of the election [2]. Albano moved for a new trial, arguing that the issue was impliedly admitted and that the recount itself proved the discrepancy, but the CFI denied the motion on procedural grounds [2, 3]. Albano filed the present petition for certiorari and mandamus [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance gravely abused its discretion in dismissing the petition for recount after the recount had already been completed and the discrepancy confirmed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court granted the petition and set aside the lower court's dismissal. The Court held that the dismissal was unjustified because the question of whether the recount would affect the election result was raised *motu proprio* by the lower court only after the recount was completed and the falsification of the returns was confirmed [5]. The result of the recount itself served as clear proof that the discrepancy affected the election; otherwise, the petition would have been purposeless [5]. If the lower court believed such proof was indispensable, it should have required it before proceeding with the recount, not after [6].

Furthermore, the authority of the CFI under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code is restrictive and summary in nature, limited to the mathematical counting of votes to offer prompt relief for simple controversies [7]. It does not involve the appreciation of ballots or determination of validity, which are reserved for election contests [8, 9]. Legal technicalities should be used to aid the law's intention to restore public tranquility, not defeat it [7]. The Court distinguished this case from *Chiongbian v. CFI*, noting that there was no tampering of ballot boxes here that would render a recount futile [9].

Petition granted. The respondent court is ordered to immediately declare the result of the judicial recount.
