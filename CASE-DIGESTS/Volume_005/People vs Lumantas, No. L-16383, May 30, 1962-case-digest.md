I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FELIPE LUMANTAS, EDILBERTO LUMANTAS and FLORENCIO OPAY, G.R. No. L-16383, May 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On September 21, 1956, in Tambakan, Lanao del Norte, the deceased Sabiniano Capua and his group were clearing a lot when they were approached by the accused Felipe Lumantas, Edilberto Lumantas, and Florencio Opay, members of a rival settler association [1, 2]. Following a verbal confrontation regarding the land, Opay hacked Capua [1]. Capua attempted to flee but was blocked by a group of the accused's companions. Felipe Lumantas then struck Capua on the head with a piece of wood, knocking him down. While Felipe held the prostrate victim, Edilberto Lumantas stabbed Capua in the abdomen, causing his death [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance found the accused guilty of murder [3]. The accused appealed, claiming self-defense and that a companion, Brigido Vinia, was the actual killer [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused are criminally liable for the death of the victim.
2. W/N the killing was attended by treachery, qualifying the crime to murder.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the guilt of the accused based on the positive testimony of eyewitnesses. The version of the defense, including the attempt of defense witness Vinia to claim sole responsibility for the killing, was rejected as an attempt to shield the appellants [6].

2. **NO.** The Court held that treachery was not present. Although the fatal stab wound was inflicted while the victim was held prostrate on the ground, this was merely a phase of a frontal and hand-to-hand clash between two armed groups ready to fight each other [7, 8]. Citing *People v. Luna* and *People v. Cañete*, the Court ruled that a qualifying circumstance like treachery cannot be considered if the attack was not treacherous in its inception [7, 8]. Furthermore, the Court found no evident premeditation or abuse of superior strength [8, 9].

Consequently, the crime committed is **Homicide**, not Murder. The decision of the lower court is **MODIFIED** [10, 11].
