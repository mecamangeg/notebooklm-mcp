**I. CAPTION**
AQUILINA LARGADO v. JUDGE LUPO A. MASAGANDA and ANGELO DE LOS REYES, G.R. No. L-17624, June 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
On January 7, 1960, respondent-appellant Angelo de los Reyes filed a petition for guardianship in the Justice of the Peace Court of Unisan, Quezon. Despite the objection of petitioner-appellee Aquilina Largado, the mother of the minors, the court appointed De los Reyes as guardian [1]. Largado moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the Justice of the Peace Court lacked jurisdiction under Republic Act No. 2613 [2]. When her motion was denied, she filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon [2]. The CFI granted the writ and ruled that the Justice of the Peace Court had no jurisdiction to appoint a guardian under the law [2]. De los Reyes appealed the CFI decision to the Supreme Court [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Justice of the Peace Court had jurisdiction to appoint a guardian at the time the petition was filed in 1960.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that the Justice of the Peace Court lacked jurisdiction. Section 10 of Republic Act No. 2613, enacted on August 1, 1959, amended Section 88 of the Judiciary Act of 1948 (Republic Act No. 296) to expressly exclude the appointment of guardians from the jurisdiction of Justice of the Peace courts [3].

Although the Secretary of Justice had opined that this exclusion was merely a legislative oversight, the Court held that such a mistake could not be corrected by executive fiat but only by legislation [4]. Congress eventually rectified this error by enacting Republic Act No. 3090 on June 17, 1961; however, because the new law did not contain a saving clause, it could not be given retroactive effect to validate the appointment made in 1960 [4].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [5].
