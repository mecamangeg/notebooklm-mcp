I. CAPTION
TERESA REALTY, INC. v. CARMEN PREYSLER VDA. DE GARRIZ, G.R. No. L-14717, July 31, 1962, 115 Phil. 696, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant-appellant Carmen Preysler Vda. de Garriz acquired a leasehold right and a residential house on a parcel of land in Santa Mesa, Manila, owned by plaintiff-appellee Teresa Realty, Inc. The original lease contract was set to expire on December 31, 1953. Prior to expiration, Teresa Realty offered to renew the lease for five years at an increased monthly rental of P225.40 (calculated at 12% of the land's assessed value of P22,540). Vda. de Garriz refused the increase.

Consequently, Teresa Realty filed an action for unlawful detainer in the Municipal Court of Manila, which ordered Vda. de Garriz to vacate and pay the new rental rate. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Manila affirmed the judgment. Vda. de Garriz appealed to the Court of Appeals, arguing that the ejectment proceedings should be suspended pursuant to Republic Act No. 1599 (amending R.A. No. 1162), as the property was part of a landed estate (Hacienda de Santa Mesa) subject to expropriation and occupied by more than 50 tenants. The Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court on the legal issue regarding the applicability of R.A. No. 1599.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the ejectment proceedings should be suspended under Republic Act No. 1599 due to the property's status as a landed estate subject to expropriation.
2. W/N the increased monthly rental of P225.40 is reasonable.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the remedies provided in Republic Act No. 1599 and Republic Act No. 1162, such as the suspension of ejectment proceedings, cannot be availed of unless proceedings for the expropriation of the land have actually been instituted by the government. The mere presence of conditions authorizing expropriation—such as the land being part of a landed estate, the duration of the lease, or the number of tenants—is insufficient to suspend ejectment if no expropriation case has been filed.

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that a monthly rental of P225.40, which is equivalent to 12% per annum of the assessed value of the land (P22,540), is a reasonable amount for the use of the property.

The judgment appealed from is affirmed.
