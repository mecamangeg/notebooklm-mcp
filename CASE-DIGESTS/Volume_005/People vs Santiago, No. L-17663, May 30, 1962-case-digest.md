I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ISAURO SANTIAGO, G.R. No. L-17663, May 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant-appellee Isauro Santiago was charged with an offense for allegedly uttering defamatory statements through an "amplifier system" on October 5, 1959. The Information was filed on August 11, 1960. Santiago moved to quash the information, arguing that the crime charged was oral defamation, which prescribes in six months, and had therefore already prescribed. The prosecution opposed, arguing that the use of an amplifier system falls under "radio" or "similar means" constituting libel under Article 355 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), which has a longer prescriptive period. The Court of First Instance of Manila granted the motion to quash. The prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N defamatory statements uttered through an amplifier system constitute libel under Article 355 of the Revised Penal Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The act constitutes oral defamation, not libel. The Supreme Court held that an "amplifier system" does not fall within the term "radio" or "similar means" under Article 355 of the RPC. First, "radio" involves the transmission of electromagnetic waves without intervening wires, whereas an amplifier system uses conducting wires [1]. Second, the specific media listed in Article 355 (writing, printing, lithography, phonograph, etc.) share a common characteristic: their "permanent nature" as a means of publication [2]. This permanence justifies the graver penalty for libel compared to oral defamation [2]. An amplifier system lacks this permanent nature [3].

Consequently, the facts alleged constitute the crime of Oral Defamation under Article 358 of the RPC, which prescribes in six months [4]. Since the alleged act occurred on October 5, 1959, and the information was filed on August 11, 1960 (more than 10 months later), the crime had prescribed on April 5, 1960 [4].

The Order of the lower court quashing the information is affirmed [4].
