I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. UNITED STATES LINES COMPANY, G.R. No. L-16850, May 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
United States Lines Company (respondent), a foreign corporation licensed to do business in the Philippines, operates vessels and acts as a local shipping agent. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (petitioner) assessed deficiency taxes against respondent for the period of 1950 to 1955. The assessment involved two main points of contention: (1) the CIR converted "collect" revenues (freight fees earned in the Philippines but paid in dollars in the US) at the Monetary Board rate of P2.00375 to $1.00, rather than the legal rate of P2.00; and (2) the CIR assessed the 2% common carrier’s percentage tax on the gross receipts of West Coast Trans-Oceanic Steamship Lines (a non-resident foreign corporation), for which respondent acted as an agent regarding chrome ore shipments.

The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled in favor of respondent, holding that the "collect" revenues should be converted at the P2.00 rate since no foreign exchange took place, and that respondent was not liable for the taxes of its principal, West Coast, as the law imposes the tax on the owner/operator. The CIR appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the conversion rate of P2.00375 to $1.00 applies to "collect" revenues paid in dollars abroad and not remitted to the Philippines.
2. W/N a local shipping agent is liable for the percentage tax on the gross receipts of its non-resident foreign principal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The conversion rate should be the legal rate of P2.00 to $1.00. The Court affirmed the CTA's finding that the "collect" freight fees were paid in the United States and were not actually remitted to the Philippines or converted into pesos. Since no foreign exchange operations were involved, Section 48 of Republic Act No. 265 applies, not the exchange rate fixed by the Monetary Board.

2. **YES.** Respondent is liable for the tax. Although Section 192 of the Tax Code imposes the percentage tax on the business of transportation (owners or operators), whoever acts on behalf of the carrier may be held liable to pay the tax. The Court found that respondent acted as a general agent, or "husbanding agent," representing the vessel's ownership to the public and the government. Under Article 595 of the Code of Commerce, a ship agent represents the ownership of the vessel and may take judicial and extrajudicial steps in matters relating to commerce. Logically, the government may enforce tax liabilities against the agent for the principal. To rule otherwise would allow non-resident corporations to do business in the Philippines without being subject to local tax laws.

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is MODIFIED, and the case is REMANDED to the court *a quo* for re-examination and verification of records to determine the exact taxable amount.
