I. CAPTION
THE SOCIAL SECURITY COMMISSION v. THE HON. JUDGE FROILAN BAYONA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-13555, May 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On August 30, 1957, the Faculty Club of the University of Santo Tomas, Inc. and San Beda College Lay Faculty Club, Inc. filed a petition for declaratory relief with preliminary injunction before the Court of First Instance of Manila, presided by Respondent Judge Bayona [1]. The clubs had existing private gratuity and retirement funds and opposed the Social Security Commission's (SSC) directive to integrate them into the Social Security System effective September 1, 1957 [1]. They argued that integration would impair the obligation of their contracts and deprive members of property without due process, as their private systems offered better benefits [1].

Judge Bayona issued an *ex parte* writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the SSC from compelling integration [2]. The SSC moved to dissolve the injunction, arguing, among others, that the law is presumed constitutional and that the clubs failed to show irreparable injury [2]. The lower court denied the motion to dissolve, prompting the SSC to file a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction before the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the issuance of the preliminary injunction against the implementation of the Social Security Law was proper based on the existence of irreparable injury.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Supreme Court ruled that the issuance of the writ was improper because the respondents failed to prove irreparable injury [4].

Under the rules relative to injunctions, damages are "irreparable" only when there is no standard by which their amount can be measured with reasonable accuracy [5, 6]. The term "irreparable injury" refers to the difficulty of measuring the damages inflicted, not the amount of damages itself [7, 8]. If full compensation can be obtained by way of damages, equity will not apply the remedy of injunction [9].

In this case, the alleged damages the respondent corporations might suffer (the payment of contributions) were susceptible to mathematical computation and therefore not irreparable [8]. Furthermore, the SSC has sufficient funds to refund the contributions should the law later be declared unconstitutional [10]. Conversely, restraining the enforcement of the law would cause greater prejudice to the System if the law is eventually upheld, as collecting back contributions and interests would be difficult and the System's operations would be disrupted [11].

Petition is granted. The writ of preliminary injunction issued by the respondent judge is lifted [12].
