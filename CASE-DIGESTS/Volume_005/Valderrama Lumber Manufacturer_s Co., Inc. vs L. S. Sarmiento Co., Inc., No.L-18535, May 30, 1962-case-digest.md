I. CAPTION
VALDERRAMA LUMBER MANUFACTURER'S COMPANY, INC. v. L. S. SARMIENTO CO., INC., HON. MACAPANTON ABBAS and THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF, G.R. No. L-18535, May 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Valderrama Lumber had been occupying a foreshore land in Davao as a log pond since 1958. On September 26, 1960, respondent L. S. Sarmiento Co., claiming to have a government lease over the same land, demanded that petitioner vacate within ten days. When petitioner refused, respondent filed an ejectment case in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Mabini, Davao. The complaint alleged respondent's right as a lessee and petitioner's refusal to vacate but did not allege that petitioner's possession was obtained through force, intimidation, threats, strategy, or stealth, nor that a prior legal right of possession had expired.

The JP Court ruled in favor of Sarmiento, ordering Valderrama to vacate and pay rentals. Valderrama appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) and filed a supersedeas bond. However, due to Valderrama's failure to deposit monthly rentals pending appeal, the CFI ordered the immediate execution of the judgment. Valderrama filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition, arguing the JP Court lacked jurisdiction over the case.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Justice of the Peace Court had jurisdiction over the ejectment case based on the allegations in the complaint.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the allegations in the complaint determine the jurisdiction of the court. To invoke the jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace Court in an ejectment suit, the complaint must make out a case for either: (1) **Forcible Entry**, by alleging the plaintiff was deprived of possession by force, intimidation, threats, strategy, or stealth (Rule 72, Section 1, Rules of Court); or (2) **Unlawful Detainer**, by alleging that the defendant's right of possession had terminated and the occupancy was being unlawfully withheld.

In this case, the complaint failed to allege deprivation by any of the means required for forcible entry. It also failed to allege a contractual relationship or priority that would show the withholding of possession was "unlawful" in the legal sense required for unlawful detainer. The use of the word "unwarranted" in the complaint was merely descriptive and insufficient to constitute an allegation of unlawful withholding. Since the JP Court did not acquire jurisdiction, the CFI did not acquire appellate jurisdiction.

The petition is **GRANTED**, the preliminary injunction is made permanent, and the proceedings in the Justice of the Peace Court are declared null and void.
