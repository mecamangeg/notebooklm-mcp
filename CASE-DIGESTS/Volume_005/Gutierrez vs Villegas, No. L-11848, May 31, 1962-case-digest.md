I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED IRENE SANTOS; ADELA SANTOS GUTIERREZ v. JOSE D. VILLEGAS and RIZALINA SANTOS RIVERA, G.R. No. L-11848, May 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Irene Santos died intestate in 1954, leaving as heirs her husband Jose D. Villegas (Administrator) and two nieces, Rizalina Santos Rivera and Adela Santos Gutierrez. In January 1955, Adela signed a deed of assignment transferring all her rights in the estate to Rizalina for P50,000.00 and filed a manifestation withdrawing from the proceedings [1, 2]. Shortly thereafter, Adela alleged that the deed was obtained through fraud and undue influence. She filed a separate civil action to annul the deed and filed a motion in the probate court (CFI Rizal, Pasay Branch) requesting to be furnished with copies of all pleadings and orders [2, 3].

The probate court initially granted Adela's motion but later set it aside upon the Administrator’s opposition, reasoning that Adela had lost her standing due to the assignment. However, upon Adela's motion for reconsideration, the regular presiding judge reinstated the order directing the Administrator to furnish her with pleadings. The Administrator and Rizalina appealed, arguing Adela was no longer a party in interest [4-6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an heir who has executed a deed of assignment of her rights to a co-heir is still entitled to be furnished with pleadings and orders in the probate proceedings while an action for annulment of said assignment is pending.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. Adela Santos Gutierrez is an indispensable party whose interest in the estate was established at the time of the decedent's death [7]. While she executed a deed of assignment, she subsequently filed an action to annul it, rendering the transfer contested.

The Court held that every act intended to put an end to indivision among co-heirs is deemed a partition, regardless of its form (Art. 1082, New Civil Code) [7]. Such a transaction in an intestate proceeding is in the nature of an extrajudicial partition which requires court approval. Heirs cannot divest the probate court of its jurisdiction by the mere act of assignment and desistance [7, 8]. Furthermore, the motion was not a request for "intervention" by a third party, but a plea by an original party to enforce her right to participate and receive notice, as her standing was not lost merely because of an assignment that she is actively contesting [9].

The order appealed from was affirmed, with costs against the appellants [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. Justices Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, and Dizon concurred. Chief Justice Bengzon took no part [11].
