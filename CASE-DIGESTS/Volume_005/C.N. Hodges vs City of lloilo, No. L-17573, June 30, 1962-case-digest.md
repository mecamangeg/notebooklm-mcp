I. CAPTION
C. N. HODGES v. CITY OF ILOILO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17573, June 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Prior to 1911, the Municipality (now City) of Iloilo acquired portions of land to widen Marina (now Rizal), P. Gomez, and Ortiz Streets. In 1935 or 1936, petitioner C.N. Hodges purchased Lots Nos. 820, 821-A, and 924, which formed part of these widened streets, and was issued Transfer Certificates of Title. The City of Iloilo collected real estate taxes from Hodges for these lots.

Hodges filed a complaint against the City to recover possession of the lots, the taxes paid, and damages. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint regarding possession but ordered the City to refund the erroneously collected taxes. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, finding that the lots were part of public streets even before 1911. Hodges appealed, arguing that his Torrens titles are indefeasible and not subject to prescription or laches, and that the City is estopped from denying his ownership due to the collection of taxes.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a registered owner can recover possession or value of land that forms part of a public street.

IV. RULING
**NO.** Public streets are property of the public domain, destined for public use, and are beyond the commerce of man (*Cavite v. Roxas*). As such, they cannot be validly registered in the name of a municipality or a private individual.

While a Torrens title is generally indefeasible, Section 39 of Act 496 (Land Registration Act) establishes exceptions to the efficacy of such titles, specifically excluding "roads and highways." Therefore, the registration of a public street in the name of a private person is ineffective. The Court applied the ruling in *Ledesma v. Municipality of Iloilo*, holding that one who purchases a lot forming part of a public street has no right to recover the land or be paid its value. Hodges, having purchased the properties long after they became public streets, is presumed to have known what he was buying and cannot claim ownership despite his titles.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.
