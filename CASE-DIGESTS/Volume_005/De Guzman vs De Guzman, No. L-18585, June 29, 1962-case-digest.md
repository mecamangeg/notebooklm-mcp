I. CAPTION
CESAR DE GUZMAN v. PASTOR L. DE GUZMAN, as Honorable Judge of Court of Agrarian Relations, Third Regional District, San Fernando, Pampanga, and JOSE MIRANDA, G.R. No. L-18585, June 29, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cesar De Guzman (tenant) and private respondent Jose Miranda (landholder) were parties to two interrelated agrarian cases (CAR Cases Nos. 865-P and 913-P) involving a rice land leasehold in Arayat, Pampanga [1, 2]. The cases were set for a joint hearing on April 6, 1961. However, petitioner’s counsel received the notice of hearing only at 3:00 P.M. on the preceding day, April 5 [3]. Due to the late notice, it was impossible for counsel to notify the petitioner, who resided in a remote barrio, or to file a timely motion for postponement [3]. Consequently, neither petitioner nor his counsel appeared at the hearing. Upon Miranda’s motion, respondent Judge De Guzman dismissed petitioner's case (913-P) for "lack of interest" and allowed Miranda to present evidence *ex parte* in the other case (865-P) [1]. On the same day, the court rendered a decision authorizing petitioner's ejectment [4]. Petitioner’s motion for reconsideration was denied, prompting this petition for certiorari [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion and denied petitioner due process by dismissing the case and hearing the evidence *ex parte* despite the insufficient notice of hearing.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal of the case and the declaration of default clearly deprived the petitioner of his day in court through no fault or negligence on his part [5]. The record showed that counsel received notice only the afternoon before the trial, making it physically impossible to prepare or request a postponement [3, 6].

While the adjournment and postponement of trials are matters within the sound discretion of the trial court, this discretion is limited by the fundamental principle that a party must be given a reasonable opportunity to prepare for trial to obtain due process [5]. Citing *Cing Hong So v. Tan Boon Kong* and *Valerio v. Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources*, the Court ruled that when a party is unprepared for trial without malice, fault, or inexcusable negligence, it is an abuse of discretion to deny them a reasonable opportunity to prepare [6, 7]. Furthermore, since the case involved the petitioner's means of livelihood, he should have been given the opportunity to prove his claim regarding the classification of the land and the rental amount [6, 8].

The petition is **GRANTED**, the assailed order and decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations are annulled, and the case is remanded to said court for further proceedings [9].
