I. CAPTION
LEONCIO GARCHITORENA, et al. v. ROSA DE LOS SANTOS, et al., G.R. No. L-17045, June 30, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On December 23, 1954, petitioners Leoncio Garchitorena and his brothers (Plaintiffs) filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur against respondents Rosa de los Santos and her siblings (Defendants), claiming ownership of two parcels of land in Goa, Camarines Sur. The Defendants alleged that they had previously been declared owners of the land in a prior case against Juan Garchitorena, the Plaintiffs' brother [1, 2].

During the trial on November 26, 1957, the lower court found that Juan Garchitorena was in possession of the disputed land and was an indispensable party. Consequently, the court ordered the Plaintiffs to amend their complaint within ten days to implead Juan as a defendant. The Plaintiffs failed to file the amended complaint within the prescribed period. On February 4, 1958, the trial court dismissed the case for failure to prosecute [3]. The Plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved a question of law [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the complaint for failure to amend and implead an indispensable party was proper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. The Court held that ordering an amendment to a complaint to implead a party lies within the discretion of the trial court [4, 5]. Since the person to be impleaded, Juan Garchitorena, was determined to be an indispensable party, the Plaintiffs had no other choice but to comply with the order [5, 6].

The Plaintiffs' refusal or failure to comply with the court's order constituted a valid ground for the dismissal of their complaint pursuant to **Section 3, Rule 30 of the Rules of Court**, which provides that an action may be dismissed upon motion or by the court *motu proprio* when the plaintiff fails to comply with the rules or any order of the court [5, 7]. The Court cited *Bautista vs. Teodoro, Jr.*, where a similar dismissal for failure to amend a complaint or file a bill of particulars was upheld [7].

The order appealed from is affirmed [8].
