I. CAPTION
FARM IMPLEMENT MACHINERY CO. v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-12613, May 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On July 9, 1954, petitioner Farm Implement Machinery Co. imported 833 cases of merchandise which arrived in Manila. The petitioner presented a Central Bank Release Certificate covering "Semolina" (Commodity Code No. 040802-NEC). However, upon examination by the Bureau of Customs, the shipment was found to contain "Macaroni" and "Spaghetti" (Commodity Code No. 040804-UI). Consequently, the goods were seized for violation of Central Bank Circular No. 44 in relation to Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code. The goods were released upon the filing of a surety bond. The Collector of Customs later ordered the forfeiture of the bond, ruling that the release certificate did not correspond to the actual goods. The Commissioner of Customs and the Court of Tax Appeals affirmed this decision. Petitioner appealed, arguing that since the macaroni and spaghetti were made of semolina, they fell under the "Semolina" classification and the importation was valid.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the importation of macaroni and spaghetti under a release certificate for "semolina" is subject to forfeiture.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts, ruling that a variance existed between the release certificate and the goods imported. While the subject macaroni and spaghetti were made of semolina, the Court held that the specific classification for "Semolina" (Code No. 040802-NEC) applies to semolina "prepared in a manner not elsewhere specified" [1, 2]. Once semolina is converted into alimentary paste like macaroni or spaghetti, it loses its original classification and falls under the specific designation for "Macaroni and Spaghetti" (Code No. 040804-UI) [3, 4].

Under Central Bank Circular No. 44, no item may be released without a specific release certificate issued by the Central Bank [5]. Since the certificate presented was for "Semolina" and not the actual "Macaroni" or "Spaghetti" imported, there was no valid license for the shipment [5]. Therefore, the goods were imported "contrary to law" and were properly subject to forfeiture under Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code [5]. The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals was affirmed [6].
