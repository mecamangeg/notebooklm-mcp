I. CAPTION
LUMEN POLICARPIO v. THE MANILA TIMES PUB. CO., INC., CONSTANTE C. ROLDAN, MANUEL V. VILLA-REAL, E. AGUILAR CRUZ and CONSORCIO BORJE, G.R. No. L-16027, May 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Lumen Policarpio, the executive secretary of the UNESCO National Commission, filed a suit for damages against the Manila Times Publishing Co., Inc. and its editors and reporters [1]. The suit stemmed from two articles published in the *Saturday Mirror* and *Daily Mirror* in August 1956 [1]. The August 11 article featured a headline "WOMAN OFFICIAL SUED / PCAC RAPS L. POLICARPIO ON FRAUD" and stated that Policarpio was charged with malversation and estafa in complaints filed by the Presidential Complaints and Action Commission (PCAC) [2]. In reality, the criminal complaints were filed by Herminia D. Reyes, a former subordinate whom Policarpio had separated from service, and not by the PCAC [3, 4]. The PCAC was only conducting an administrative investigation [3]. The article also omitted details regarding the insignificant value of the alleged misappropriations [5, 6]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that although the articles contained inaccuracies, the defendants did not act with malice [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the publication constitutes a privileged communication as a "fair and true report," thereby exempting the defendants from liability for libel.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the publication does not enjoy immunity. Under Article 354 of the Revised Penal Code, every defamatory imputation is presumed to be malicious unless it falls under specific exceptions, such as a "fair and true report, made in good faith, without any comments or remarks" of official proceedings [8].

The Court found that the August 11 article was not a fair and true report. It falsely stated that the PCAC filed the charges, which implies a greater probability of guilt compared to charges filed by a private individual, especially a disgruntled former subordinate [9]. Furthermore, the sub-title "PCAC RAPS L. POLICARPIO ON FRAUD" was a false comment or remark [10]. Consequently, the presumption of malice applies. Although the August 13 article rectified the error by clarifying the PCAC did not file the complaints, this only mitigates but does not wipe out the liability arising from the first article [11].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the defendants are ordered to pay the plaintiff P3,000 as moral damages and P2,000 as attorney's fees [12].
