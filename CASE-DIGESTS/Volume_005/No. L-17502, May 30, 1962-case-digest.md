I. CAPTION
A. V. H. & COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSIONER, MARIANO B. ALUMNO, SHERIFF OF MANILA and SHERIFF OF PASAY CITY, G.R. No. L-17502, May 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Mariano B. Alumno filed a claim for injury against petitioner A. V. H. & Company. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) rendered a decision ordering the petitioner to pay Alumno P849.09 plus fees [1]. Petitioner did not appeal this decision [1]. Subsequently, the WCC issued a writ of execution directing the Sheriffs of Manila and Pasay City to seize petitioner's property to satisfy the judgment [1].

Petitioner filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to stop the execution. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that it was insufficient in substance and form because the petitioner had neither appealed the WCC decision nor raised the issue of jurisdiction with the Commission prior to filing the petition [2]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the WCC's authority to issue writs of execution under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A and Act No. 3428 [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Workmen's Compensation Commission has the authority to issue writs of execution.
2. W/N Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is constitutional insofar as it authorizes the WCC to issue writs of execution.
3. W/N the petition for prohibition should be granted despite petitioner's failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 3428) does not authorize the WCC to render an "enforceable" decision in the sense that a writ of execution may be issued directly by the Commission [4]. Under Section 51 of the Act, if an employer fails to comply with a decision, a certified copy must be filed with the proper Court of First Instance, which shall then render a decree or judgment in accordance therewith [4]. It is this judgment of the court, not the Commission's decision, that may be enforced by a writ of execution [4].

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the portion of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A which authorizes the Workmen's Compensation Commission to issue writs of execution is unconstitutional [5, 6]. The Court cited *Everlasting Pictures, Inc. v. Fuentes* and *Pastoral v. Workmen's Compensation Commission* to support this finding [6]. Consequently, the writs of execution issued by the WCC are null and void [6].

3. **YES.** Although the petitioner failed to comply with procedural requirements for a writ of prohibition (by failing to appeal or raise the issue with the WCC first), the Court ruled that it cannot sanction the enforcement of patently void writs of execution [6, 7]. The patent nullity of the writs justifies setting aside the procedural defects [6, 7].

**Disposition:** The order appealed from is SET ASIDE, the writs of execution are declared NULL and VOID, and the writ of preliminary injunction is made PERMANENT [7].
