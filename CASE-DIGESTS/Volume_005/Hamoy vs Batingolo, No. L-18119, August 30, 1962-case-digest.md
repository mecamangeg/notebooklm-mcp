**I. CAPTION**
**PABLO S. HAMOY v. PAMBAYA BATINGOLO, ET AL. (MACAINDIG RANGAR, Movant-Appellant)**, G.R. No. L-18119, August 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Pablo S. Hamoy filed an ejectment case against Pambaya Batingolo and others in the Court of First Instance of Lanao. The court ruled in favor of Hamoy, ordering the defendants to vacate the land. Batingolo appealed, but Hamoy successfully moved for execution pending appeal. The sheriff enforced the writ but ejected Macaindig Rangar, who was in actual possession of the property, claimed ownership, and was not a party to the case. Rangar filed an urgent motion in the same court praying that his possession be restored. The trial court dismissed the motion, ruling that it had already lost jurisdiction over the case because the record on appeal and appeal bond of Batingolo had already been approved, even though the record had not yet been forwarded to the appellate court. The court advised Rangar to file a separate action. Rangar appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the trial court retains jurisdiction to hear a third-party possessor's motion for relief from a writ of execution after the record on appeal has been approved but not yet transmitted to the appellate court.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while the approval of the record on appeal and appeal bond generally perfects the appeal, the trial court retains control over the case until the record is actually transmitted to the appellate court. Under Section 9, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, the trial court may still issue orders for the protection and preservation of the rights of parties not involved in the matter litigated in the appeal. Rangar’s claim of ownership was not involved in Batingolo's appeal.

Furthermore, relying on *Omaña v. Gatulayao*, the Court ruled that the proper procedure for a person deprived of possession by a writ of execution is to invoke the aid of the court cognizance of the case to determine the character of his possession. To deny such a hearing and force the third party to file a separate action would constitute a deprivation of property without due process of law.

The Order appealed from is set aside, and the case is remanded to the court *a quo* for further proceedings.
