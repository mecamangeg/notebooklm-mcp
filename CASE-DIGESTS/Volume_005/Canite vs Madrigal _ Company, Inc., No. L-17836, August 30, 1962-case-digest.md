I. CAPTION
MATEO CANITE, ET AL. v. MADRIGAL & CO., INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-17836, August 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Mateo Canite and others filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against Madrigal & Co. to recover unpaid salaries and allowances allegedly due from March 17 to September 30, 1948, for their service as crew members of the vessel S.S. Bridge [1]. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of *res judicata* and prescription [2].

It appeared that the same plaintiffs had previously filed Civil Case No. 29663 against the same defendants for the same cause of action. In that prior case, the court rendered a decision awarding wages to one plaintiff (Miguel Olimpo) but dismissing the complaint regarding the other plaintiffs (including Canite) for "insufficiency of evidence" [3]. The plaintiffs failed to appeal that decision on time, rendering it final and executory [3]. Based on these facts, the lower court dismissed the present action. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing that a motion to dismiss cannot be based on facts not alleged in the complaint and that the prior dismissal was not on the merits [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the motion to dismiss was proper even if based on facts not alleged in the complaint.
2. W/N the dismissal of the prior case constituted a bar by *res judicata* to the present action.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that under Rule 8 of the Rules of Court, a motion to dismiss differs from a demurrer under the old Code of Civil Procedure. Unlike a demurrer, a motion to dismiss may be based on facts not alleged in the complaint, except when the ground is that the complaint states no cause of action [4]. The court cited *Ruperto v. Fernando* to support the rule that a motion to dismiss may even deny the facts alleged in the complaint [4].

2. **YES.** The Court found all requisites of *res judicata* present: (a) final judgment; (b) jurisdiction of the court; (c) judgment on the merits; and (d) identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action [4, 6]. The plaintiffs' contention that the prior dismissal was not on the merits because they failed to testify was rejected. Under Section 4, Rule 30 of the Rules of Court, a dismissal without reservation, other than for lack of jurisdiction, operates as an adjudication upon the merits [5]. Consequently, the prior dismissal for insufficiency of evidence barred the new action. The Court also noted that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations, as more than ten years had elapsed since the cause of action accrued in 1948 [6].

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [7].
