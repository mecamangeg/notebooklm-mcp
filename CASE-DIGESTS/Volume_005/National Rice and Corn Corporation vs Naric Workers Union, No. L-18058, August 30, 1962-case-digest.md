I. CAPTION
NATIONAL RICE AND CORN CORPORATION (NARIC) v. NARIC WORKERS UNION and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-18058, August 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
The respondent NARIC Workers Union represents laborers and *capataces* (foremen) employed by petitioner NARIC on a daily basis for warehouse handling work. On June 22, 1957, Republic Act No. 1880 (Forty-Hour-Week Law) was enacted, reducing the work week to five days (Monday to Friday) and mandating an automatic wage increase for government employees to prevent a reduction in their weekly take-home pay [1, 2].

Pursuant to the law, NARIC adjusted the daily wages of non-union employees and security guards from P4.00 to P4.80 effective July 1, 1957 [3]. However, NARIC refused to adjust the wages of the unionized warehouse workers, arguing they were merely casual employees hired for 2-4 days a week and thus did not suffer wage diminution [4]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found that the union members actually worked continuously (Monday to Saturday) prior to the law and were discriminated against due to their union membership. The CIR declared NARIC guilty of Unfair Labor Practice and ordered the wage adjustment [5, 6]. NARIC appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the daily wage workers are entitled to the automatic wage increase under R.A. 1880.
2. W/N NARIC committed Unfair Labor Practice by refusing to adjust the wages of the union members.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Daily wage workers are included within the purview of Section 1 of R.A. 1880, provided they work continuously for the whole week [7, 8]. The objective of the law is to compensate workers for the diminution in wages resulting from the reduction of work days to five days a week [2, 7]. The CIR made a factual finding, supported by evidence, that the subject laborers and *capataces* worked continuously (Monday to Saturday) before the law took effect [6]. Consequently, they suffered a diminution in weekly wages when the work schedule was reduced, entitling them to the automatic adjustment [9].

2. **YES.** Under Section 4(a)(4) of Republic Act No. 875, it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to discriminate in regard to any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage union membership [10, 11]. The evidence established that non-union daily wage workers received immediate wage adjustments on July 1, 1957, while union members were either delayed (receiving increases only on February 1, 1958) or denied adjustment entirely (in the case of the *capataces*) [12]. The Court held that this disparity in treatment implied discrimination against the workers for being union members/organizers [12].

The judgment of the Court of Industrial Relations is **AFFIRMED** [13].
