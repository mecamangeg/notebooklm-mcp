I. CAPTION
ALEJANDRO SARMIENTO v. SERAFIN QUEMADO, G.R. No. L-18027, June 29, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In the November 17, 1959 general elections, the municipal board of canvassers of Laua-an, Antique proclaimed Serafin Quemado as Vice-Mayor with 1,155 votes, a margin of one vote over Alejandro Sarmiento (1,154 votes). Sarmiento filed an election protest with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Antique. The CFI ruled in favor of Sarmiento, declaring him the winner with a plurality of two votes (later reduced to one upon reconsideration). Quemado appealed to the Supreme Court. A preliminary issue arose regarding the Court's jurisdiction, as Section 178 of the Revised Election Code provides that CFI decisions in election protests for vice-mayor are not appealable. The appeal also questioned the CFI's appreciation of various ballots alleged to be marked, written by two hands, or containing misplaced votes.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review the CFI decision despite the prohibition in Section 178 of the Revised Election Code.
2. W/N the disputed ballots were correctly appreciated as marked or invalid by the lower court.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Although Section 178 of the Revised Election Code states that decisions of courts of first instance in election protests affecting vice-mayors are not appealable, the Supreme Court is not deprived of jurisdiction. Under the Constitution, the Supreme Court cannot be deprived of its jurisdiction to review, reverse, modify, or affirm final judgments of inferior courts in all cases where an error or question of law is involved (citing *Calano v. Cruz*).

2. **NO** (in part). The Court reversed the lower court's appreciation of several ballots based on the following principles:
   *   **Marked Ballots:** The crossing out of printed numbers and writing new numerals (e.g., "4", "5", "6") in the senatorial slots did not mark the ballot where poor penmanship indicated the voter merely intended to reproduce a sample ballot. Similarly, repeating a candidate's name (e.g., "Borja Borja") does not invalidate the ballot absent evidence *aliunde* of intent to identify. However, ballots where names were clearly indented to a specific pattern, or where well-educated voters unnecessarily repeated names (e.g., "Nietes Nietes"), were correctly annulled as marked.
   *   **Idem Sonans:** Names like "S. Amado" and "Sirapin" were correctly counted for Serafin Quemado under the rule of *idem sonans*.
   *   **Misplaced Votes:** A vote for "Vice S. Quemada" written in the provincial board space, preceded by a vote for "Mayor", was valid as the voter's intent was clear. Conversely, Sarmiento could not claim a vote where his name was written near the councilors' space while the Vice-Mayor space was already filled with another name.

**Disposition:** Decision reversed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
