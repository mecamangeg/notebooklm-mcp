I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. THE HON. AMADOR E. GOMEZ, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Cebu and BABY GO, represented by his natural guardian and father GREGORIO GO, G.R. No. L-17852, May 31, 1962, Paredes, J. [1]

II. FACTS
On March 4, 1960, Gregorio Go filed a petition on behalf of his minor son, Baby Go, to change the latter's name to "Alberto Go." [2] The Court of First Instance of Cebu, presided by Judge Amador E. Gomez, granted the petition on October 8, 1960. [2, 3] The Solicitor General, representing the Government, filed a Notice of Appeal and Record on Appeal within the reglementary period. [3] However, Judge Gomez issued an Order on November 12, 1960, denying the appeal on the ground that it was "frivolous." [3] The Judge reasoned that the City Fiscal, acting for the Solicitor General, could not point out specific errors in the decision and had submitted the case without argument during the trial. [3] The Republic filed the instant petition alleging that the respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion and unlawfully neglected a duty enjoined by law. [3]

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may deny an appeal filed within the reglementary period on the ground that it is frivolous. [4]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that where an appeal is presented on time and attended by the requirements of law, it should be given due course pursuant to Section 3, Rule 41. [4] It is not within the province of the lower court to declare, at that stage of the proceedings, whether an appeal is frivolous or not; such duty devolves upon the appellate courts. [4] Although the City Fiscal could not point out specific errors during the hearing on the Record on Appeal, the instruction from the Solicitor General to appeal indicated that the decision was contrary to law and evidence, and thus was not merely capricious. [4] As an essential part of the judicial system, courts are enjoined to facilitate the due course of appeals. [4]

The Writ is granted; the Order of November 12, 1960 is reversed, and the respondent Judge is ordered to give due course to the appeal. [5]
