I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GUILLERMO MANANTAN, G.R. No. L-14129, August 30, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
In a decision promulgated on July 31, 1962, the Supreme Court ruled that a justice of the peace is subject to the prohibition in Section 54 of the Revised Election Code [1]. Consequently, the Court set aside the trial court's order of dismissal and remanded the case for trial on the merits [2]. Defendant-appellee Manantan filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that remanding the case for trial would place him in double jeopardy, as jeopardy had already attached when the lower court dismissed the charges [2]. However, during the government's appeal of the dismissal order, Manantan did not raise the issue of double jeopardy to resist the appeal, nor did he argue this defense in his brief [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendant can invoke the defense of double jeopardy to prevent the remand of the case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the defendant cannot invoke the defense of double jeopardy because he is deemed to have waived this constitutional right [3]. The Court reasoned that double jeopardy is a waivable defense [4]. Since Manantan failed to raise the issue when the government appealed the order of dismissal and did not argue it in his brief, he performed no affirmative act to assert the privilege and thus waived it [3, 5]. The Court applied the doctrine laid down in *People vs. Casiano* and *People vs. Pinuila*, stating that limiting one's argument to the merits of the appeal without questioning the prosecution's right to appeal constitutes a waiver of constitutional immunity [6, 7].

The Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED** [4].
