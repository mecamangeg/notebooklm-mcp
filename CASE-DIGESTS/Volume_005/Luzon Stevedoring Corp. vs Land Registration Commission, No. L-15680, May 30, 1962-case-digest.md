I. CAPTION
LUZON STEVEDORING CORPORATION v. LAND REGISTRATION COMMISSION and REGISTER OF DEEDS OF PAMPANGA, G.R. No. L-15680, May 30, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On October 16, 1958, Luzon Stevedoring Company, Inc. (LUSTEVECO) and Visayan Stevedore Transportation Company, Inc. (VISTRANCO) entered into a Merger Agreement wherein LUSTEVECO transferred all its assets to VISTRANCO, which later changed its name to Luzon Stevedoring Corporation (petitioner) [1]. On February 18, 1959, petitioner requested the Register of Deeds of Pampanga to cancel the certificates of title covering properties in Pampanga and issue new ones in its name without the payment of registration fees [1]. The Register of Deeds refused, stating that the merger involved a transfer of property subject to fees [1]. Petitioner appealed *en consulta* to the Land Registration Commission (LRC), arguing that the transfer was not the type contemplated by Republic Act No. 928 [1]. The LRC upheld the Register of Deeds' refusal, prompting this appeal [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the transfer of assets pursuant to a merger agreement is subject to the payment of registration fees.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the LRC resolution, holding that the merger agreement clearly constituted a conveyance and transfer of ownership from one juridical person (LUSTEVECO) to another (VISTRANCO) [3, 4]. Such transfer falls under paragraphs C-16 and C-17, Section 114 of the Land Registration Act (Act 496), as amended by Republic Act No. 928, which expressly requires the collection of fees for the registration of deeds of conveyance or transfer [4, 5]. The Court emphasized that the reason for the payment of registration fees is not the consideration of the transfer, but the service rendered by the Register of Deeds [6]. Consequently, the petitioner cannot evade payment by claiming the transfer lacked consideration or citing tax laws, as the fees are for services rendered [5, 6].

The resolution of the Land Registration Commission is affirmed [5].
