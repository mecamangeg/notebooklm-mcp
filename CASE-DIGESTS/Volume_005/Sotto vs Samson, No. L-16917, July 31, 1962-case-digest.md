I. CAPTION
PLARIDEL SOTTO, Administrator of the Testate Estate of Vicente Sotto v. QUINTILLANA SAMSON (SANSON), G.R. No. L-16917, July 31, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Quintillana Samson (Samson) was the client of Atty. Vicente Sotto in several cases against her estranged husband regarding her paraphernal property (Lot No. 872). While these cases were pending, and despite a writ of injunction, Samson sold Lot 872 to Atty. Sotto on May 11, 1926. After the passage of Act No. 3922 (authorizing married women to dispose of paraphernal property without spousal consent), Samson executed a deed on September 17, 1932, confirming and revalidating the 1926 sale. Sotto argued this 1932 deed was a valid new contract. In 1941, Samson filed an action to annul the sale, alleging Sotto took advantage of her financial difficulties and confidence. The Court of First Instance of Cebu declared the sale void, which the Court of Appeals affirmed. Sotto petitioned for review, arguing the sale was valid and the action had prescribed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the sale of the property by the client to her lawyer is void under Article 1459 of the Civil Code.
2. W/N the action to annul the sale has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the sale is void because it violates Article 1459 of the Civil Code, which prohibits lawyers from purchasing property or rights that are the object of litigation in which they intervene by their profession. On May 11, 1926, Sotto was Samson's counsel in Civil Case No. 6448 and Civil Case No. 6528, both involving the subject lot. This prohibition is founded on public policy to curtail any undue influence of the lawyer upon his client due to their confidential association. Even the ratification deed executed on September 17, 1932, is covered by the prohibition because the litigation had not yet terminated; the Supreme Court only granted the motion to withdraw the appeal in the related case on September 26, 1932.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the action has not prescribed. The document sought to be avoided is the ratification deed executed on September 17, 1932. Since the action was commenced in 1941, less than ten (10) years had elapsed.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED** with **MODIFICATION**. Sotto is ordered to pay rents from September 17, 1932, and Samson is ordered to return the purchase price of P21,595.00 plus legal interest.
