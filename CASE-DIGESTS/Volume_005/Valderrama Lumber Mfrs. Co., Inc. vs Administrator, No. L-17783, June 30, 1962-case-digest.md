I. CAPTION
VALDERRAMA LUMBER MANUFACTURERS COMPANY, INC. v. THE ADMINISTRATOR and THE HEARING OFFICER, Regional Office No. V, Department of Labor, Iloilo City, G.R. No. L-17783, June 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Carlos Fernandez and other former employees filed claims for overtime pay, salary differentials, and separation pay against petitioner Valderrama Lumber with Regional Office No. V of the Department of Labor [1]. When the Hearing Officer set the case for hearing, petitioner filed an action for prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental, questioning the Regional Office's jurisdiction [2]. Petitioner argued that money claims fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of ordinary courts [2]. Respondents invoked Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, implemented by Executive Order No. 218, which allegedly vested Regional Offices with jurisdiction over labor standards claims [2]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A was validly approved by Congress and part of Republic Act No. 997 [3]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Reorganization Plan No. 20-A was validly passed as a statute.
2. W/N Reorganization Plan No. 20-A validly conferred judicial powers (jurisdiction over money claims) upon the Regional Offices of the Department of Labor.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is not a valid statute because the procedure for its enactment violated the Constitution. Section 6(a) of the Reorganization Act allowed the plan to become law through legislative inaction (silence or adjournment), which contrasts with the Constitutional requirement that a bill must undergo positive and separate action by each House of Congress and be presented to the President for approval (Sec. 20[5], Art. VI, Constitution) [6, 7]. Citing *Miller v. Mardo*, the Court held that a procedure dispensing with the "passage" of a measure and presentation to the President reverses democratic processes [8].

2. **NO.** The Government Survey and Reorganization Commission was empowered by R.A. 997 only to reorganize the Executive Branch and create or abolish administrative functions, not judicial ones [9]. Consequently, the conferment of judicial powers—such as jurisdiction over money claims—upon Regional Offices, which they did not previously possess, is invalid [10].

The decision appealed from was **REVERSED and SET ASIDE**, and the writ of preliminary injunction was revived and made permanent [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred [11].
