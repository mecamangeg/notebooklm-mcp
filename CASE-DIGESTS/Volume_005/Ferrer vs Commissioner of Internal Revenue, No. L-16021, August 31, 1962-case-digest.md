I. CAPTION
ANTONIO PORTAFERRER v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-16021, August 31, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Antonio Portaferrer was the sole proprietor of "La Suiza Bakery." On September 15, 1955, he sold the bakery to Juan Pons for P100,000.00. The assets included accounts receivable, raw materials, supplies, goodwill, machinery, and furniture. Petitioner initially paid income tax on the reported profit of P19,678.09 [1, 2].

Later, Petitioner filed a claim for refund, arguing that the bakery was a "capital asset" held for more than 12 months, and therefore, under the Tax Code, only 50% of the gain should be taxable. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (respondent) took no action. Petitioner appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). The CTA denied the refund, ruling that the sale was not of a single asset but of individual assets (some capital, some ordinary), and Petitioner failed to show the price attributable to each to determine the correct tax [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the sale of the bakery business constitutes a sale of a single "capital asset" such that the profit is only 50% taxable.
2. W/N the Petitioner may raise a new computation of profit (deducting liabilities) for the first time on appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the sale of a going business is not a sale of a single asset but of the individual assets that make up the business [4]. Citing the U.S. case *Williams v. McGowan* as persuasive authority for Section 34(a)(1) of the Tax Code, the Court ruled that a business must be "comminuted into its fragments," and each fragment separately matched against the statutory definition of capital assets [5, 6]. Since the Petitioner failed to allocate the selling price among the specific assets (e.g., distinguishing stock-in-trade from capital assets), the Court could not ascertain the proper capital and ordinary gains taxes [4, 7].

2. **NO.** The Court refused to consider Petitioner's new claim that the business had liabilities reducing the profit to P495.05. This issue was not raised in the CTA. A party is not permitted to change their theory on appeal as it would be unfair to the adverse party [8].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **AFFIRMED** [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Concepcion and Barrera, JJ., concurred in the result [9].
