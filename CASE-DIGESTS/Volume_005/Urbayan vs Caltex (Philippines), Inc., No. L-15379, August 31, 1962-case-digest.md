**I. CAPTION**
TEODORO L. URBAYAN v. CALTEX (PHILIPPINES), INC. and JOHN GRAY, G.R. No. L-15379, August 31, 1962, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiff Urbayan filed a complaint for damages against defendants Caltex and John Gray in the Municipal Court of Tacloban. The court dismissed the case against Caltex. On the trial date against Gray, Urbayan failed to appear, resulting in a dismissal for non-suit and a declaration of default on Gray's counterclaim [1, 2]. Gray presented evidence on his counterclaim. Later that same day, Urbayan appeared and the court granted his request to lift the dismissal and default orders [2]. However, instead of presenting evidence, Urbayan manifested his intention to appeal the decision to the Court of First Instance (CFI) [3].

The Municipal Court rendered a decision ordering Urbayan to pay damages to Gray [4]. Although Urbayan’s counsel did not receive a copy of the decision until September 28, 1954, Urbayan filed a notice of appeal on September 17 (the date of the decision), erroneously referencing an "order dismissing the complaint" against the defendants [4]. The CFI of Leyte dismissed the appeal as against Gray, ruling it was defective for being taken from the dismissal order rather than the decision on the counterclaim [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the notice of appeal was valid despite being filed before the appellant received the written decision and containing inaccurate references to the order appealed from.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the circumstance that the appellant had not actually received a copy of the decision when he filed the notice of appeal did not militate against his intention to appeal [6]. Urbayan was already certain that any decision would be adverse to him because only the defendant Gray had presented evidence [6]. The decisive fact is that the appellant intended to appeal and did so by filing the corresponding notice, which could have been against no other action of the court than its decision [6]. The Court ruled that technicalities, such as the inaccurate reference in the notice of appeal to a non-existent order of dismissal, should give way to the realities of the situation [6].

The order of the Court of First Instance is set aside, and the case is remanded to the court below for further proceedings [7].
