I. CAPTION
DY LAM GO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-15858, July 31, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Dy Lam Go filed a petition for naturalization to become a Filipino citizen. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the petition on the sole ground that he failed to prove that he had conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner "during the entire period of his residence in the Philippines" in his relations with the constituted government and the community, as required by Section 2, Paragraph 3 of the Revised Naturalization Law [1]. Dy Lam Go appealed the decree, arguing he had proven his qualifications [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner satisfied the requirement of proving proper and irreproachable conduct during the entire period of his residence in the Philippines.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the dismissal of the petition.

The Supreme Court held that while the phrase "during the entire period of his residence" in the Revised Naturalization Law excludes the period of infancy or childhood—since a child is not conscious or responsible for their acts—the applicant is still required to prove proper and irreproachable conduct for the period when they became responsible for their acts in the community [3]. Such conduct may be proved by competent evidence other than the vouching witnesses, such as the absence of derogatory police and court records, which serve to corroborate the applicant's testimony [3]. In this case, the Court found that the petitioner failed to prove the requisite conduct provided for in Section 2, Paragraph 3 of the Revised Naturalization Law [3].

The decree appealed from denying the petition for naturalization is affirmed [4].
