**I. CAPTION**
FRANCISCO C. CALO v. DELFIN C. FUERTES, DIRECTOR OF LANDS and SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, G.R. No. L-16537, June 29, 1962, Padilla, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Calo contested the homestead application of respondent Fuertes regarding a lot in Butuan City. The Director of Lands dismissed Calo’s claim. On appeal, the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DANR) modified the decision only to order Fuertes to reimburse Calo for improvements. Calo appealed to the President of the Philippines on August 1, 1958, but withdrew the appeal on August 8, 1958, before the President could act on it.

Subsequently, Calo filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan. The CFI dismissed the petition for failure to state a cause of action and failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Calo attempted to appeal to the Supreme Court; while his notice of appeal was filed within the reglementary period (13th day), his appeal bond was filed on the 31st day after notice of judgment [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petitioner’s appeal to the Supreme Court was perfected.
2. W/N the petitioner exhausted administrative remedies to justify a petition for certiorari and prohibition.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that the appeal was not perfected because the appeal bond was filed on the 31st day, exceeding the reglementary period provided in Section 17, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court [5].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the withdrawal of the appeal taken to the President of the Philippines is tantamount to not appealing at all. In administrative cases, an appeal to the President is the last step the aggrieved party should take [6]. Furthermore, a special civil action for certiorari and prohibition under Rule 67 lies only when there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy. The appeal to the President was the plain, speedy, and adequate remedy available to the petitioner, and his withdrawal of said appeal was fatal to his case [7].

The appeal is **DISMISSED**.
