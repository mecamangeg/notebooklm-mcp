I. CAPTION
JESUS J. ANDRES v. MELECIO R. DOMINGO, as COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, et al., G.R. No. L-17831, August 31, 1962, Barrera, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jesus J. Andres filed a petition for mandamus in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and other officials to compel the payment of his withheld salaries and damages totaling P50,000.00 [2]. Respondents alleged that some salaries were uncollected while others were withheld because Andres's sick leave applications were disapproved due to his refusal to submit to a medical examination regarding his transfer to Zamboanga [3, 4]. The trial court dismissed the petition, finding that Andres failed to prove a clear legal right to the salaries or that respondents acted in bad faith [4, 5]. Andres appealed directly to the Supreme Court, assigning errors challenging the lower court's factual findings regarding the demand for payment, his entitlement to sick leave, and the alleged damages [6-8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to decide the appeal. [9, 10]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court declined to decide the case, ruling that the assignment of errors raised by the petitioner—specifically regarding the demand for payment, refusal to pay, and entitlement to sick leave—all involved **questions of fact** [9, 10]. The Court held that in view of the questions of fact raised and the amounts involved, it had no jurisdiction to review the case [10]. Matters involving questions of fact and amounts falling below the jurisdictional threshold properly belong to the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals [10, 11].

Consequently, the case was **REMANDED** to the Court of Appeals for determination in accordance with law [1, 10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. [10]
