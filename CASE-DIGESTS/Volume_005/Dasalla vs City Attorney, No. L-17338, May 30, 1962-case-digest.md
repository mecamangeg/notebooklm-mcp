I. CAPTION
ADRIANO D. DASALLA, JESUSA F. DE DASALLA and CONSUELO DASALLA v. CITY ATTORNEY OF QUEZON CITY and FRANCISCO T. KOH, G.R. No. L-17338, May 30, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Dasalla filed a civil action to annul a mortgage on their properties, alleging they were induced to sign the instrument without receiving the agreed loan from the Philippine Bank of Commerce or the guarantee from Republic Surety & Insurance Co. [1]. Subsequently, respondent Francisco T. Koh, president of the surety company, filed three criminal complaints for usurpation, grave coercion, and estafa against petitioners [2]. Petitioners requested the Quezon City Attorney to suspend the preliminary investigation of these complaints, arguing that the pending civil case regarding the validity of the mortgage constituted a prejudicial question [2]. When the Assistant City Attorney scheduled the resumption of the investigation, petitioners filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance of Rizal to stop the proceedings [2]. The trial court dismissed the petition for lack of merit [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the preliminary investigation of the criminal complaints should be suspended on the ground of a prejudicial question.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the time to ask for the suspension of criminal proceedings on the ground of a prejudicial question is not during the period of preliminary investigation, but *after* such investigation and after the prosecutor shall have filed the corresponding information in court [3, 4]. The Court reasoned that should the prosecuting officer find during the investigation that the mortgage was not really executed or was tainted by deceit, he would certainly not file the information against the petitioners [4].

The Order of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [5].
