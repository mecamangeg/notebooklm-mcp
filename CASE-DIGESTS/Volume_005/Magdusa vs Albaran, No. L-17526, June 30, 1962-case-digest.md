I. CAPTION
GREGORIO MAGDUSA, ET AL. v. GERUNDIO ALBARAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17526, June 30, 1962, J.B.L. Reyes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Magdusa and respondents (Albaran, et al.) verbally formed a de facto partnership for the sale of general merchandise in Surigao. Magdusa contributed P2,000.00 as capital while the respondents contributed their labor. The agreement stipulated that 25% of the net profits would be added to the capital, and the remaining 75% would be divided among the members based on length of service [1].

Sometime in 1953 and 1954, respondents expressed their desire to withdraw from the partnership. Magdusa prepared a computation of the partners' shares (Exhibit "C"), but subsequently refused to pay, denying the partnership's existence [1]. Respondents filed a complaint for the recovery of their shares. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, ruling that the other partners were indispensable parties but were not impleaded. The Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal, ordering Magdusa to pay the respondents personally, reasoning that the action was merely for the recovery of money and not for dissolution [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the retiring partners can recover their shares from the managing partner without the prior dissolution and liquidation of the partnership.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that a partner's share cannot be returned without first dissolving and liquidating the partnership [4]. The return of a partner's share is dependent on the discharge of the creditors, whose claims enjoy preference over those of the partners (citing *Po Yeng Cheo v. Lim Ka Yam* and Civil Code, Art. 1839) [4-6]. Furthermore, all members of the partnership are interested in its assets and are entitled to be heard in the matter of liquidation; however, the other partners were not impleaded in this case [4, 7].

The Court also ruled that petitioner Magdusa cannot be held liable in his personal capacity for the payment of the partners' shares. He holds the assets only as a manager or trustee for the partnership, and it is the partnership itself that must refund the shares to the retiring partners [6, 7].

The decision of the Court of Appeals was **REVERSED** and the action **DISMISSED**, without prejudice to a proper proceeding for dissolution and liquidation [8].
