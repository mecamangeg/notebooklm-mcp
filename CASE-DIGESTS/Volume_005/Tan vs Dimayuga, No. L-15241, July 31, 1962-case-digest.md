I. CAPTION
SOLEDAD TAN v. CARLOS DIMAYUGA, ET AL. (WALTER MASON, Defendant-Appellant), G.R. No. L-15241, July 31, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Soledad Tan sued defendant Carlos Dimayuga (taxicab owner) for damages arising from physical injuries sustained in a collision. Dimayuga filed a third-party complaint against Walter Mason (private car driver). Mason failed to file an answer within the reglementary period but mailed a "Motion to Dismiss the Third Party Complaint" on January 3, 1958. Unaware of this motion, the trial court declared Mason in default on January 14, 1958, upon Dimayuga's motion. Mason was subsequently informed by the clerk of court that his motion was received late and could not be acted upon.

Months later, Mason filed an Answer to the amended complaint, incorporating a cross-claim against Dimayuga and a third-party complaint against the taxi driver. The trial court dismissed the cross-claim and struck out Mason's third-party complaint, ruling that allowing them would tantamount to setting aside the default order. Mason filed a "Petition and Motion for Reconsideration" to set aside the default only on December 16, 1958—eleven months after the default order.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in refusing to set aside the order of default against Mason.
2. W/N the trial court erred in dismissing the cross-claim and striking out the pleadings filed by Mason after he was declared in default.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The remedy of a defendant declared in default is a petition for relief under **Rule 38, Section 3 of the Rules of Court**, which must be filed within sixty (60) days after learning of the order and not more than six (6) months after such order was entered [1]. Mason filed his petition eleven months after the entry of the order, which was clearly beyond the reglementary period [1]. Furthermore, Mason was guilty of inaction; after being informed that his initial motion could not be acted upon, he failed to inquire about the status of the case or timely ask for the reopening of the default order [2].

2. **NO.** A defendant who has been declared in default loses his standing in court as a party litigant [3]. To allow a cross-claim filed after the cross-claimant has been declared in default to remain would be tantamount to setting aside the order of default, as the cross-claimant would effectively re-obtain standing in court [4]. Additionally, regarding Mason's motion for leave to file a third-party complaint, the Court ruled that without proof of service, a motion is nothing but a "scrap of paper" which the clerk of court should not receive for filing [5].

Orders affirmed; case remanded to court of origin for further proceedings.
