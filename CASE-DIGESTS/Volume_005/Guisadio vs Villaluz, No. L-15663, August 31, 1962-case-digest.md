I. CAPTION
ANTONIO GUISADIO v. RUBEN A. VILLALUZ, F. D. SINGCULAN and ANDRES SAJUL, G.R. No. L-15663, August 31, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Antonio Guisadio, a chauffeur-examiner and acting registrar of the Motor Vehicles branch in Cebu City, received a letter on December 19, 1958, notifying him of a decision by the Commissioner of Civil Service. The decision considered him resigned for laxity and negligence. On the same day, District Supervisor Singculan directed him to turn over his property accountabilities. Guisadio, unwilling to vacate immediately as he had not received the full text of the decision and believed it was not yet final, filed a suit in the Court of First Instance of Cebu to enjoin the respondents from enforcing his separation. He subsequently received the full decision on January 5, 1959, and filed a motion for reconsideration on January 8, 1959. The trial court ruled in favor of Guisadio, enjoining the enforcement of the decision until his motion for reconsideration or appeal to the Civil Service Board of Appeals was resolved. Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the decision should be immediately executed in the public interest.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the decision of the Commissioner of Civil Service was immediately executory pending reconsideration or appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the decision of the Commissioner of Civil Service does not become executory if it is still subject to reconsideration and appeal to the Civil Service Board of Appeals [1, 2]. At the time Guisadio filed the suit, the administrative adjudication was not yet final, and nothing in the decision itself could be construed as requiring immediate implementation [2]. Consequently, Guisadio was entitled to exhaust his remedies (motion for reconsideration and appeal) before the decision could be enforced. The Court also noted that it was unnecessary to implead the Commissioner of Civil Service because Guisadio was not asking for a review of the decision's merits, but merely questioning its immediate execution [2]. The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.
