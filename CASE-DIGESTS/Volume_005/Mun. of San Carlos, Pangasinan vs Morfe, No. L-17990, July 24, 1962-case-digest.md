I. CAPTION
MUNICIPALITY OF SAN CARLOS, PANGASINAN v. HON. JESUS F. MORFE, DIRECTOR OF LANDS, STANDARD VACUUM OIL CO., MARIANO AUSTRIA and ADELA DE LA CRUZ, G.R. No. L-17990, July 24, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Civil Case No. 13788 and Cadastral Case No. 60 involving Lot No. 986 were pending before the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan presided by respondent Judge Jesus F. Morfe [1]. Private plaintiffs (Heirs of Agbuya, et al.) claimed ownership of the lot against the Director of Lands and its lessees [2].

Petitioner Municipality of San Carlos filed a motion to intervene, alleging that Lot No. 986 was "part and parcel of the public plaza" and that the municipality was its "true and legal owner" [3]. Judge Morfe denied the motion and the subsequent motion for reconsideration [4]. Petitioner filed this original action for Mandamus to compel the lower court to allow the intervention [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipality of San Carlos has a legal right to intervene based on its claim that the subject lot is part of the public plaza.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the lower court had no duty to allow the intervention. Even assuming the lot is part of a public plaza, it is public land belonging to and subject to the administration and control of the Republic of the Philippines [3]. The Municipality has no right to claim it as patrimonial property [3].

Whatever right of administration the Municipality exercised over the plaza was not proprietary but governmental in nature, performed as an agency of the Republic [5]. Since the Municipality possesses no property right or right *in rem* over the lot, and the interest of the national government was already represented by the Director of Lands who was a party to the case, the denial of the intervention was proper [5].

The petition is dismissed and the writ of preliminary injunction dissolved [6].
