I. CAPTION
TEODORA LOPERA v. SEVERINO E. VICENTE, G.R. No. L-18102, June 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Teodora Lopera operated a cabaret in Puerto Princesa, Palawan. On December 4, 1960, Municipal Mayor Severino Vicente ordered the cabaret closed pursuant to Ordinance No. 6, series of 1960. The ordinance prohibited the establishment and operation of cabarets within a radius of 500 lineal meters from any public building, school, hospital, or church. Lopera’s cabaret was located 476 meters from the Provincial Hospital. Lopera filed a petition for mandamus, arguing that the ordinance contravened Section 1 of Republic Act No. 1224, which prohibits such establishments within a radius of 200 lineal meters. The Court of First Instance of Palawan declared the ordinance illegal, ruling that the Municipal Council could not increase the 200-meter distance fixed by Congress. Vicente appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Ordinance No. 6, series of 1960, is valid despite fixing a 500-meter restricted distance which exceeds the 200-meter distance mentioned in Republic Act No. 1224.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court, holding that Section 1 of Republic Act No. 1224 empowers municipal councils to regulate or prohibit the operation of cabarets. The law's proviso stating that no such places shall be operated "within a radius of two hundred lineal meters" establishes a **minimum** requirement. It is not intended to fix a definite distance, but leaves the municipal council discretion to fix whatever distance it deems best for the welfare of its inhabitants, provided it is not below the 200-meter minimum [1]. This delegation is consistent with the **General Welfare Clause** (Section 2238, Revised Administrative Code) [1]. Since the ordinance fixed a distance of 500 meters (which is above the 200-meter minimum), its validity cannot be questioned, and the closure of Lopera's cabaret was justified [2]. The order appealed from is **REVERSED** and the writ of mandatory preliminary injunction is set aside [3].
