I. CAPTION
BANK OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS as Special Administrator of the Testate Estate of the late JOSE V. RAMIREZ v. ANGELA M. VDA. DE BUTTE, G.R. No. L-15566, June 29, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On May 30, 1956, petitioner Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), acting as the special administrator of the estate of Jose V. Ramirez, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against respondent Angela M. Vda. de Butte [1]. BPI sought to recover stock certificates representing 16,580 shares in Central Luzon Milling Company, Inc., as well as various office supplies, furniture, and equipment, claiming these belonged to the deceased [1].

The respondent filed an answer claiming ownership of the items and interposed a counterclaim for the recovery of a safe and typewriters allegedly borrowed by the deceased [2]. On April 3, 1959, the CFI rendered judgment declaring the respondent the owner of the disputed shares and personal property, thereby dismissing BPI's complaint. The court also dismissed the counterclaim for lack of proof [2]. BPI filed a notice of appeal to the Supreme Court [2]. The total value of the claim involved in the appeal was less than P200,000.00 [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that it lacks jurisdiction because the total claim involved in the appeal is less than P200,000.00 [3]. Under Sections 17 and 29 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended by Republic Act No. 2613, the Court of Appeals has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over cases where the value of the controversy does not exceed said amount [3, 4]. Consequently, the appeal was certified to the Court of Appeals for determination and judgment [5].
