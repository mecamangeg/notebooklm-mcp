I. CAPTION
FELICISIMO RONQUILLO, deceased, substituted by ANTONIA DEGUZMAN VDA. DE RONQUILLO, ET AL. v. FRANCISCO MARASIGAN, G.R. No. L-11621, May 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
In 1941, Felicisimo Ronquillo and Francisco Marasigan verbally entered into a 10-year lease over a nipa-land. Marasigan later dispossessed Ronquillo, leading to Civil Case No. 80. The trial court ordered Marasigan to deliver the land and execute a 10-year lease, excluding the war years (1942-1947). This judgment became final. During execution in 1950, Ronquillo deposited the full rental amount for 10 years (P10,922.31, totaling P14,000 with prior payments), which Marasigan withdrew and collected.

However, a dispute arose regarding the lease expiration. In a previous certiorari proceeding (G.R. No. L-5910), the Supreme Court ruled that the final judgment in Civil Case No. 80 could not be modified to extend the lease term to compensate for further delays. However, the Court observed that Marasigan's acceptance of the full 10-year rental *after* the judgment might create "new rights" enforceable in a separate suit. Consequently, Ronquillo filed the present action (Civil Case No. 977) to enforce this new right. The lower court dismissed the complaint on the ground of *res judicata*.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the present action for the extension of the lease period is barred by *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the doctrine of *res judicata* does not apply. The present suit is premised on a *new right* created by Marasigan's acceptance of the full rental payment for ten years, which occurred *after* the previous judgment had become final. This acceptance constituted an acquiescence that the lease should be for the full ten-year period from the date of actual possession (November 10, 1950). Marasigan is now estopped from claiming otherwise, as "no one should enrich himself at the expense of another" [1], [2].

The Court emphasized that to deny the appeal on technical grounds of *res judicata* would sacrifice justice. Citing *Alonzo v. Villamor* and *Viuda de Ordeveza v. Raymundo*, the Court reiterated that it has the power to suspend its own rules or except a case from their operation when the purposes of justice require it [3], [4]. The dismissal was reversed, and the case was remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Labrador and Concepcion concurred in the result.
