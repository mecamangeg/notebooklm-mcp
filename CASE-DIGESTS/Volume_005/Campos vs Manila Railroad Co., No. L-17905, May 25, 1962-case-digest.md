I. CAPTION
IGNACIO CAMPOS, ET AL. v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17905, May 25, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Ignacio Campos, an employee of Manila Railroad Company since 1920, was summarily dismissed after being implicated in a criminal case. Following his acquittal, he requested reinstatement with back wages on August 20, 1960, which the company refused [1, 2]. His union filed a petition on his behalf with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [2]. The respondent moved to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction. On October 14, 1960, the CIR dismissed the petition, ruling that a claim for reinstatement not accompanied by other claims related to conditions of employment is not cognizable by the industrial court [2]. Campos filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over a claim seeking only reinstatement with back wages, without allegations of unfair labor practice or violations of specific labor laws.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, restating that for the CIR to acquire jurisdiction under Republic Act No. 875, the following circumstances must be present: (a) there must exist an employer-employee relationship or the claimant must seek reinstatement; and (b) the controversy must relate to a case certified by the President as involving national interest, or have a bearing on an unfair labor practice charge, or arise under the Eight-Hour Labor Law or Minimum Wage Law [3]. In this case, the petitioner merely sought reinstatement with back wages and did not claim salary differentials, overtime pay, or allege unfair labor practice [4]. Consequently, the suit is a mere money claim falling under the jurisdiction of the regular courts [4]. The order appealed from is affirmed [5].
