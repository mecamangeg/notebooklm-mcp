I. CAPTION
FABIAN PUGEDA v. RAFAEL TRIAS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16925, July 24, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Miguel Trias purchased lots from the Friar Lands Estate during his marriage to Maria C. Ferrer. At the time of his death, the lots were not fully paid for. Pursuant to the Friar Lands Act (Act No. 1120), the certificate of sale was transferred to the name of his widow, Maria, who subsequently completed the installment payments using the proceeds/fruits of the lands. Consequently, the titles were issued in the widow's name.

The Supreme Court previously rendered a decision declaring the properties as conjugal. The defendants-appellants (heirs of Trias) filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the lots belong to the widow as her exclusive paraphernal property because the titles were issued to her after she paid the installments. They further argued that the properties were never partitioned as conjugal assets, citing the absence of a registered deed of partition in the Registry of Deeds.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the friar lands purchased by the husband but titled in the widow's name after his death remain conjugal property.
2. W/N the failure to register the deed of partition proves that no partition was decreed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The properties remain conjugal. The Court held that under Article 1401 of the Civil Code of Spain, properties acquired by the husband and wife are conjugal properties [1]. The provision in the Friar Lands Act transferring the certificate of sale to the wife upon the husband's death is merely an administrative device designed to facilitate the documentation of the transaction and the collection of installments [1]. It does not produce the effect of destroying the character of the lands purchased as conjugal property, nor does it convert them into the widow's paraphernal property simply because the title was issued in her name [1]. The ruling in *Arayata v. Joya* is inapplicable as it refers to a widow's superior rights over unapproved transfers, not the nature of the property [2].

2. **NO.** The failure to register the partition was likely due to the neglect of the parties, but it does not constitute proof that the partition was not made [3]. The Court found that a project of partition and its judicial approval (Exhibit "3-Trias" and Annex "E") were presented in court and cannot be ignored [3]. Furthermore, adjudications may be made *pro indiviso* without the actual physical division of the properties among the heirs [3].

Motion for reconsideration denied and judgment declared final [4].
