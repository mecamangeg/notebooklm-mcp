I. CAPTION
SALUD DEL ROSARIO VDA. DE JACINTO, ET AL. v. PILAR LAZARO VDA. DE JACINTO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17957, May 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
The parties are heirs of the deceased spouses Andres Jacinto and Maria C. Santos. After the spouses died intestate, their son Pedro Jacinto (petitioners' predecessor) administered the properties, including the share of the heirs of his deceased brother, Melchor Jacinto, Sr. (respondents). In 1926, Pedro "delivered" the respondents' share only on paper. In 1927, Pedro resurveyed the estate and segregated a 5.4574-hectare portion (Lot 5) from the land allotted to respondents, registering it in his own name under OCT No. 12515 (later TCT No. 5380). Respondents believed they received their full share until 1953, when they attempted to sell the land and discovered the shortage matching Lot 5. Respondents filed an action for reconveyance in the CFI of Bulacan, which dismissed the case. The Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal, declaring respondents the owners and ordering reconveyance, finding that Pedro committed fraud. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing prescription.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for reconveyance based on an implied trust is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals, ruling that the action does not prescribe. The Court held that a co-heir who, through fraud, succeeds in obtaining a certificate of title in his name to the prejudice of his co-heirs, is deemed to hold the land in trust for the latter [1]. Citing *Juan v. Zuñiga*, the Court applied the doctrine that an action to enforce a trust is imprescriptible [1].

The Court explained that even after the lapse of one year from the decree of registration, a co-owner who knowingly registers land not allotted to him may be compelled to reconvey it, provided no innocent third party has acquired rights for value (*Palet v. Tejedor*) [2]. Public policy demands that a Torrens title not be used as a shield for fraud or breach of trust (*Cabanos v. Register of Deeds*; *Severino v. Severino*) [2].

The petition was denied, and the decision of the Court of Appeals was affirmed [3].
