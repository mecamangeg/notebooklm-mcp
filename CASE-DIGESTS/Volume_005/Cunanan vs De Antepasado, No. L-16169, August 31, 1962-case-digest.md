I. CAPTION
BLAS CUNANAN v. FELICIDAD LARA DE ANTEPASADO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16169, August 31, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On October 29, 1938, Luciano Antepasado sold a portion of his registered lot to Petitioner Blas Cunanan. The deed of sale (Exhibit A) stated the area was approximately 197 square meters [1]. After Luciano died, his widow and children (Respondents) executed a "Ratification" document (Exhibit B) on May 10, 1940, admitting a mutual error in the previous deed and clarifying that the intention was to sell 322 square meters [1, 2]. Based on Exhibits A and B, Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1481 was issued to Cunanan on May 20, 1940 [3].

In December 1951, Cunanan built a house extending into the additional area covered by Exhibit B. Respondents demanded rentals for the portion exceeding the original 197 square meters, claiming ownership. Upon Cunanan's refusal, Respondents filed an action in 1952 in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao to annul Exhibit B on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation [3].

The CFI ruled in favor of Cunanan, finding no fraud. The Court of Appeals reversed the decision, declaring Exhibit B void for lack of consideration and ruling that the extra 125 square meters belonged to Respondents, applying the principle that registered land cannot be acquired by prescription [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action to annul the contract (Exhibit B) has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals decision. The Court held that Cunanan’s claim was based on a Torrens title and the "Ratification" document (Exhibit B), not merely on adverse possession [6]. For Respondents to recover the land, they must first annul Exhibit B [6].

Under Article 1144 of the New Civil Code (and Section 43 of Act 190), an action to annul a contract based on fraud or lack of consideration prescribes in 10 years [6, 7]. Since Exhibit B was executed in 1940 and the action was filed only in 1952—more than 11 years later—the right of action had already prescribed [5, 8]. Furthermore, the Court noted that Exhibit B was essentially a reformation of the original contract to correct a mutual mistake, supported by the original consideration [9].

Petition granted; Judgment reversed.
