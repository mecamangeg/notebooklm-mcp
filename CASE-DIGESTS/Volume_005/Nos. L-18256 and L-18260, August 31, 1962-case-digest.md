I. CAPTION
FLORENTINO B. MOLINYAWE v. HON. JOSE P. FLORES, ALEJANDRO E. SEBASTIAN, RUFINO MARASIGAN and PEDRO OFIANA, G.R. Nos. L-18256 and L-18260 (and related cases), August 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Following Administrative Order No. 185, respondents (prosecutors) conducted an *ex parte* investigation into alleged fraudulent tobacco deals involving the ACCFA and Central Cooperative Exchange [1]. Evidence revealed that native and low-grade tobacco were purchased and paid for as high-grade Virginia tobacco [1]. Prosecutors sent notices to petitioners (ACCFA officials), stating that the evidence established a *prima facie* case against them and setting a preliminary investigation to allow them to present their side [1, 2].

During the preliminary investigation, petitioners requested to examine the records of the previous *ex parte* inquiry and cross-examine the witnesses who had testified therein [3]. The prosecutors denied this request, allowing access only to documentary evidence (ACCFA/CCE records) and reading the draft information [4]. Petitioners refused to participate further [4]. Informations for Malversation and Falsification were subsequently filed, and writs of preliminary attachment were issued against petitioners' properties [5, 6]. Petitioner Molinyawe also moved to quash, arguing immunity under the Anti-Graft Law (R.A. 1379) due to a pending civil forfeiture case against him [7, 8]. Respondent Judge Flores denied the motions to quash and the motion to dissolve the attachments [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioners are entitled to examine the affidavits from the *ex parte* inquiry and cross-examine witnesses during the preliminary investigation.
2. W/N the writs of preliminary attachment were validly issued based on the prosecutor's verification.
3. W/N Petitioner Molinyawe is immune from prosecution under R.A. 1379 due to a pending forfeiture case.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 1687 of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended, the right of a defendant to be present and cross-examine witnesses is conditioned upon a request that must precede the investigation by the prosecutor [9, 10]. Here, the investigation was already concluded when the notices were sent [11]. The notice did not revoke the previous inquiry but merely gave petitioners a chance to be heard; they were not entitled to examine the sworn statements or cross-examine affiants [11-13]. By providing the gist of the evidence and access to official records, the prosecutors satisfied the demands of due process [11, 14]. Furthermore, under the Rules of Court then in force, an accused in a preliminary investigation is not entitled to cross-examine witnesses as a matter of right [15].

2. **YES.** As the official prosecutor for the offended party (ACCFA), respondent Sebastian had the authority to apply for remedies to protect the government's interest, especially since civil liability was not reserved [16-18]. The prosecutor's verification that he had "personal knowledge" of the facts was valid because he personally conducted the investigation and examined the records and tobacco stocks upon which the case depended [18].

3. **NO.** Section 8 of R.A. 1379 grants immunity only to an individual who is "compelled, after having claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence" in a case [19-21]. The record failed to show that Molinyawe had actually testified or produced evidence in the civil forfeiture case, nor did it indicate the nature of such testimony to determine its relation to the criminal charges [22].

Accordingly, the petitions are denied and the cases dismissed [23, 24].
