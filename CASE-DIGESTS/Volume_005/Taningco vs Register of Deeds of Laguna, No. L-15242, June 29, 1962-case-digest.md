I. CAPTION
ROSAURO M. TANINGCO and SIMPLICIA RAMOS v. REGISTER OF DEEDS OF LAGUNA, G.R. No. L-15242, June 29, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On August 10, 1958, petitioners Spouses Taningco lent PHP 9,000.00 to Nieves Mediarito. To secure the loan, Mediarito mortgaged her "rights, interests, and participation" in six parcels of land registered as conjugal property with her deceased husband, Salvador Roxas. At the time of the mortgage, the properties were under judicial administration and had not yet been liquidated or partitioned between the widow and the heirs. The Register of Deeds of Laguna denied registration of the mortgage, reasoning that the widow could not alienate her conjugal share without prior liquidation of the partnership. The Land Registration Commissioner affirmed the denial, stating that the widow's interest was merely inchoate until settlement. Petitioners appealed the denial to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a mortgage executed by a surviving spouse over her undivided share in the conjugal partnership properties is valid and registrable despite the lack of final liquidation.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that upon the dissolution of the conjugal partnership by death, the surviving spouse's interest ceases to be inchoate and becomes actual and vested with respect to an undivided one-half share. The property relationship becomes one of co-ownership between the surviving spouse and the heirs [1, 2].

Under Article 493 of the Civil Code, a co-owner has full ownership of their part and may alienate, assign, or mortgage it, although the effect is limited to the portion allotted to them upon the termination of the co-ownership [2]. Since the mortgage is valid, it should be registered, as registration is an essential requirement for the mortgage to be validly constituted under Article 2125 of the Civil Code [3]. The Court emphasized that registration does not prejudice the rights of creditors or heirs, as the mortgage effectively covers only the portion of the estate eventually adjudicated to the widow [3, 4].

The resolution and order appealed from were **SET ASIDE**, and the Register of Deeds was ordered to register the document upon compliance with legal requisites [5].
