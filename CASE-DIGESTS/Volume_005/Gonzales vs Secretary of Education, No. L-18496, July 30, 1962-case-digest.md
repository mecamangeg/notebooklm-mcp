I. CAPTION
JOSE L. GONZALES v. SECRETARY OF EDUCATION, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18496, July 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Jose L. Gonzales was the appointed Principal of Lambunao High School. Pursuant to Republic Act No. 1595, the school was converted into the Iloilo Vocational High School. On February 18, 1959, Gonzales received an appointment as Head of the Related Subjects Department, while respondent Alfredo Pineda was appointed Principal of the new school [1]. Gonzales refused to yield the position to Pineda and filed a written protest with the Superintendent on February 19, 1959 [2]. However, on February 23, 1959—before his protest could be forwarded to the Director of Public Schools or acted upon—Gonzales filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo [2]. The CFI rendered judgment declaring Gonzales the incumbent principal and restraining the respondents [3]. The respondents appealed, arguing the action was instituted prematurely [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Gonzales failed to exhaust administrative remedies thereby rendering the suit premature.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court applied the doctrine that when a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy is accorded to an aggrieved party within the Executive Department, the courts will not interfere until that remedy has been resorted to and exhausted (*Lamb v. Phipps*) [5]. This requires the party to not merely initiate the procedure but pursue it to its appropriate conclusion (*Aircraft & Diesel Equipment Corp. v. Hirsch*) [5].

Here, Gonzales initiated an administrative protest but filed the court action before his superior officers had any opportunity to reconsider the questioned orders [6]. Since he failed to wait for the resolution of his protest, he did not exhaust available administrative remedies. Consequently, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the action is **DISMISSED** [7].
