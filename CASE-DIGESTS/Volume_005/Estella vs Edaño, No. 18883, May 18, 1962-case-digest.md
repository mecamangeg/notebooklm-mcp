I. CAPTION
PEDRO ESTELLA v. PEDRO EDAÑO, G.R. No. 18883, May 18, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Pedro Estella and Pedro Edaño were candidates for mayor of Masinloc, Zambales in the November 10, 1959 elections [1]. Edaño was proclaimed the winner by 194 votes [1]. Estella filed an election protest, but the hearings were postponed multiple times at his request [2, 3]. On July 20, 1960, the trial court granted a postponement with a warning that should Estella fail to appear at the hearing on July 21, the case would be considered submitted for decision [3]. On July 21, Estella sent a telegraphic motion for postponement because his NBI handwriting expert would not be available until August [4]. The trial court denied the motion, citing the delay and Section 177 of the Revised Election Code (regarding the 6-month decision period), and subsequently dismissed the protest for failure to substantiate the allegations [4, 5]. Estella appealed, arguing that the 6-month period is not mandatory and that the expert witness was essential [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in denying the motion for postponement and dismissing the protest for failure to adduce evidence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision [7]. The Court held that the dismissal was not based strictly on the six-month period in Section 177 of the Revised Election Code—which is directory, not mandatory—but on the protestant's failure to appear and adduce evidence [8]. The denial of the postponement was justified because the lower court had already granted multiple continuances and the specific evidence Estella sought to present (the handwriting expert) was not indispensable [9, 10]. The charges of terrorism, tampering, and misreading of ballots could have been proven by other evidence or by the ballots themselves without the need for an expert witness [11-13].

The decision and order of the lower court are affirmed [7].
