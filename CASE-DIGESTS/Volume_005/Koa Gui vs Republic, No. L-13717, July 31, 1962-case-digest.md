I. CAPTION
KOA GUI v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-13717, July 31, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Koa Gui, a Chinese citizen residing in the Philippines since 1937, filed a petition for naturalization [1]. He is married with three children and reported a total average annual income of P5,980 from his auto supply business and a partnership [2]. In his marriage contract, he signed his name as "Robert Dee Koa Gui," explaining later that "Robert" was his baptismal name [3]. Furthermore, his petition listed his residence history but failed to include a former address at 602 Benavides, Manila, which appeared on his Immigrant Certificate of Residence [4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila denied his petition on the grounds that his income was not lucrative and that he used aliases without authority [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioner satisfies the lucrative trade or occupation requirement.
2. W/N the use of the name "Robert Dee Koa Gui" disqualifies the petitioner.
3. W/N the failure to state a former residence is fatal to the petition.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** An annual income of P5,980 is not considered lucrative for an applicant with a wife and three children to support [2]. Citing *Keng Giok v. Republic*, the Court emphasized that even a higher income of P8,687.50 was insufficient for a slightly larger family, and given the high cost of living and low purchasing power of the peso, the petitioner's income does not qualify him for naturalization [2, 3].

2. **YES.** The petitioner's use of "Robert Dee Koa Gui" violated the Anti-Alias Law. Unlike in *Bing Chiong v. Republic*, where aliases used since childhood were excused, the petitioner here adopted the names "Robert" and "Dee" at an adult age regarding his marriage [3]. The Court ruled that marriage is a sacred institution requiring accurate disclosure of identity, and adding a Chinese name ("Dee") alongside a Christian name confuses the identity of the contracting party [3, 6].

3. **YES.** The failure to state all former places of residence violates Section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 (Revised Naturalization Law) [4]. The omission of the Benavides address, which was documented in his immigrant certificate, disqualifies the petitioner from naturalization [4].

The decree appealed from is affirmed [7].
