I. CAPTION
VICENTE GARCIA, ET AL. v. PEDRO DE GUZMAN, G.R. No. L-15988, August 30, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On March 24, 1959, petitioners Vicente Garcia, et al. filed a complaint against respondent Pedro De Guzman to recover a parcel of land and cancel Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 25381, alleging that De Guzman secured the registration through fraud. De Guzman moved to dismiss on grounds of res judicata and prescription.

The records established that Juan Garcia, the petitioners' father, executed a deed of donation in favor of De Guzman on June 1, 1918. De Guzman subsequently filed for registration, and a decree was entered on January 30, 1923, with the OCT issued on July 18, 1923. Juan Garcia died in 1950 without challenging the donation or asserting ownership during the 1929 cadastral survey. The trial court dismissed the complaint without a trial. Petitioners appealed, contending that the court should have heard evidence regarding their allegations of fraud.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for reconveyance is barred by prescription and the prior decree of registration.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the action is barred by the prior decree of registration entered in 1923. The Court held that the 1923 decree and the subsequent certificate of title are conclusive.

Moreover, the Court applied the rule that an action for reconveyance on the ground of fraud is barred after the lapse of four years from the time the right of action accrued [1, 2]. Juan Garcia had 32 years from the execution of the deed in 1918 until his death in 1950 to seek annulment but failed to do so [3]. Finally, the Court noted that even if the land were not registered under the Torrens system, the respondent would have acquired title by prescription due to his long possession, which precludes an action for recovery based on fraud [1, 4].

The order appealed from is affirmed.
