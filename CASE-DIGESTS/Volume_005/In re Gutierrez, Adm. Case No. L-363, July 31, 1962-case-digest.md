I. CAPTION
*In re Disbarment Proceedings Against Atty. Diosdado Q. Gutierrez*, Adm. Case No. L-363, July 31, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Atty. Diosdado Q. Gutierrez, a former municipal mayor, was convicted of the murder of Filemon Samaco. The crime was qualified by treachery and aggravated by being committed in band, with the use of a motor vehicle, and by taking advantage of his official position [1]. He was subsequently granted a conditional pardon by the President, which merely remitted the unexecuted portion of his prison sentence [2], [1]. On October 9, 1958, the victim's widow filed a complaint for his disbarment based on his conviction [3]. In his defense, Gutierrez admitted the conviction but argued that the pardon barred the disbarment proceedings, relying on the ruling in *In re Lontok* [3], [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the conditional pardon granted to the respondent bars his disbarment for conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The conditional pardon does not prevent disbarment. Under Section 5, Rule 127 of the Rules of Court, a lawyer may be removed or suspended for conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, and murder is indisputably such a crime [5], [3].

The Court distinguished this case from *In re Lontok*, where the pardon granted was absolute. An absolute pardon wipes out the guilt and makes the offender innocent in the eyes of the law, thus barring disbarment based on the conviction [4], [6], [7]. However, the pardon granted to Gutierrez was conditional and only remitted the unexecuted penalty; it did not reach the offense itself or blot out the guilt [2], [1]. Consequently, he must be judged based on the fact of his conviction. The practice of law is a privilege requiring continuing moral fitness, and the moral turpitude involved in the crime justifies his removal from the profession [8], [9].

Respondent Diosdado Q. Gutierrez is **DISBARRED** and his name stricken from the roll of lawyers [10].
