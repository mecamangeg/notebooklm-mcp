I. CAPTION
HARRY S. STONEHILL, ET AL. v. HON. JOSE W. DIOKNO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19550, June 29, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Harry S. Stonehill, Robert P. Brooks, John J. Brooks, and Karl Beck are respondents in Deportation Cases Nos. R-953 and R-955 before the Deportation Board [1]. Various papers, documents, and effects were seized from petitioners' offices, warehouses, and residences. The Supreme Court previously issued a writ of preliminary injunction preventing the respondents (Secretary of Justice, NBI Director, and Special Prosecutors) from using these seized materials as evidence in the pending deportation hearings [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the writ of preliminary injunction against the use of the seized documents in the deportation hearings should be lifted.

IV. RULING
**YES, in part.** The Court resolved to lift the writ of preliminary injunction regarding the papers, documents, and things seized from the 29 listed business premises and offices, including the U.S. Tobacco Corporation, Atlas Cement Corporation, and various warehouses [1]. Consequently, these items may be used in the deportation cases.

However, the Court ruled that the preliminary injunction **shall continue** and remain in effect regarding the papers and documents found in the residences of the petitioners at Narra Road and Urdaneta Avenue in Makati [3, 4]. The Court noted that the specific reasons for this distinction and order would be explained in the final decision to be rendered in the case [1].
