I. CAPTION
ERNESTO TAJANLANGIT v. MANUEL L. CAZEÑAS, G.R. No. L-18894, June 30, 1962, 115 Phil. 564, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ernesto Tajanlangit and Respondent Manuel Cazeñas were candidates for Mayor of Dao, Antique in the November 10, 1959 elections. The municipal board of canvassers proclaimed Tajanlangit the winner by three votes. Cazeñas filed an election protest in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Antique, which declared Cazeñas the winner by two votes. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed Cazeñas' victory but reduced his plurality to one vote (1,564 to 1,563). Tajanlangit petitioned the Supreme Court to review the CA's ruling on 16 specific ballots, while Cazeñas counter-assigned errors regarding 19 ballots.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the disputed ballots (marked with big letters, nicknames, or non-candidate names) are valid.

IV. RULING
**PARTIALLY YES/NO.** The Court modified the decision, ruling on specific ballots as follows:

1.  **Marked Ballots (Big Letters):**
    *   **NO** for Exh. T-6 ("Acsay" and "Lotilla"). The names were written in extraordinarily big printed letters, clearly intended as identification marks, invalidating the ballot [1].
    *   **YES** for Exh. T-94 ("Ledesma"). The name written in big printed letters was deemed an innocent expression of emphasis under Paragraph 18, Section 149 of the Revised Election Code (REC), as no clear intent to mark appeared [2].

2.  **Stray Votes (Non-Candidates/Derogatory):**
    *   **YES** for Exh. T-4 ("Juan C. Bajo"). While "Bajo" means "bad smell" in Visayan, an identification mark cannot be presumed. Since "Juan C. Bajo" was not a candidate, it is a stray vote which does not invalidate the whole ballot (Par. 13, Sec. 149, REC) [3].
    *   **YES** for Exh. C-77 ("Julia Valdelion"). A non-candidate's name written without evidence of intent to identify is a stray vote and does not invalidate the ballot [4].

3.  **Nicknames:**
    *   **NO** for Exh. T-139 ("ieting" for Tajanlangit's nickname "Esting"). Isolated votes using only a nickname, unaccompanied by the surname, are invalid under Par. 9, Sec. 149 of the REC. The exception in *Abrea v. Lloren* did not apply as there was no evidence the candidate was widely voted for by nickname alone [5]-[6].

4.  **Procedural Issues:**
    *   **NO** for ballots declared valid by the lower court but not questioned in the CA (Exh. C-6 et al.). Issues not raised in the CA cannot be raised for the first time in the Supreme Court [7].
    *   **NO** for review of factual findings. The CA's findings regarding evidence *aliunde* (extrinsic evidence of intent to mark) are binding on the Supreme Court [8].

**Disposition:** After re-appreciating the ballots, both candidates received exactly **1,565 valid votes**. The decision of the Court of Appeals was **MODIFIED** declaring a tie. The parties were ordered to draw lots to solve the tie pursuant to Section 170 of the Revised Election Code [9]-[10].
