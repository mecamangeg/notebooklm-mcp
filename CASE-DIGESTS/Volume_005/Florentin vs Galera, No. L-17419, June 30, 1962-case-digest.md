I. CAPTION
MARIA FAMA FLORENTIN v. LAZARO GALERA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17419, June 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Maria Fama Florentin filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of La Union to recover a parcel of land covered by a Transfer Certificate of Title, which was originally registered under a Free Patent issued to Fernando Nantes. Lazaro Galera, the defendant, claimed ownership through long-term possession and alleged that the original title was obtained by fraud. The CFI rendered judgment declaring Florentin the owner and ordering Galera to vacate the premises and pay P150.00 annually. This judgment became final.

When the CFI issued an order of demolition to enforce the judgment, Galera appealed to the Supreme Court. He argued that the order was void because the CFI lacked jurisdiction. Specifically, he contended that the land was sold to Florentin's predecessor within five years of the patent issuance in violation of Section 118 of the Public Land Law (C.A. 141), making the conveyance void *ab initio*.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court's final judgment is void for lack of jurisdiction due to the alleged nullity of the conveyance under the Public Land Law.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, holding that the appellant failed to distinguish between absence of jurisdiction and lack of cause of action. The complaint was for reinvindication of title, a matter over which the CFI had original jurisdiction under the Judiciary Act [1].

The Court reasoned that even if the conveyance to the plaintiff was void for violating the Public Land Law, this defect would only affect the plaintiff's cause of action—her right to recover—and not the court's jurisdiction to hear the case [1]. At most, the trial court's decision might have been tainted by an error of law or fact, which should have been corrected by a timely appeal [1, 2]. Since the judgment had already become final, the issues litigated cannot be reopened [3].

Appeal dismissed [4].
