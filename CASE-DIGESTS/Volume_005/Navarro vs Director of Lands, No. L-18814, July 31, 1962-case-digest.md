I. CAPTION
ANACLETO P. NAVARRO v. THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, G.R. No. L-18814, July 31, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On February 6, 1958, petitioner Anacleto P. Navarro filed an application for registration of two residential lots in Malate, Manila. The Director of Lands opposed the application and moved to dismiss on the grounds of *res judicata* and the impropriety of the application under Section 48(b) of the Public Land Law (which applies to agricultural, not residential, lands).

The lots in question had been the subject of a previous cadastral proceeding involving the same parties. In that prior case, the court declared the lots part of the public domain and dismissed Navarro's claim because he failed to prove possession since July 26, 1894, as required by the law at the time. Navarro argued that *res judicata* should not apply because Republic Act No. 1942 subsequently amended the Public Land Law to require only 30 years of continuous possession, thereby changing the issue and allowing him to prove his claim under the new standard. The trial court dismissed the application.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the application for registration is barred by the doctrine of *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the requisites of *res judicata* were present: (1) the former judgment was final; (2) it was rendered by a court with jurisdiction; (3) it was on the merits; and (4) there was identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action [1].

The specific issue of whether the lots were public domain or private property had been settled in the cadastral proceeding [2]. While Navarro argued that R.A. No. 1942 created a new legal situation by shortening the required possession period to 30 years, the Court noted that the factual findings in the previous case were conclusive. The Court of Appeals in the prior case explicitly found that Navarro failed to prove possession even for the 30-year period, noting that he only started leasing the property in 1936 and that the land was previously underwater [3, 4].

Furthermore, Navarro’s petition for review in the prior case was dismissed by the Supreme Court *after* R.A. No. 1942 was approved, meaning his claim had effectively been adjudicated in light of the new legislation [5]. A judgment in a cadastral proceeding declaring property as public land is conclusive and bars subsequent litigation over the same issue [4, 6].

The order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED**.
