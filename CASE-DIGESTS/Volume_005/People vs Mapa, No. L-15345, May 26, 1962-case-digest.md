I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RICARDO MAPA and PATRICIO ABALO, G.R. No. L-15345, May 26, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On October 11, 1958, Juan Do-oma filed a complaint for assault upon a person in authority with slight physical injuries against Ricardo Mapa and Patricio Abalo in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Dumangas, Iloilo [1]. On January 9, 1959, after an investigation, the JP Court dismissed the case, ruling that the complainant was not acting in an official capacity during the incident [2]. Subsequently, the Provincial Fiscal conducted his own preliminary investigation under Republic Act No. 732 and filed an information in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo charging the accused with direct assault [3, 4]. The accused moved to quash the information, arguing that the Fiscal lacked authority to conduct a preliminary investigation of a case already dismissed by the JP Court [4]. On March 23, 1959, the CFI granted the motion and quashed the information [3, 4]. The Provincial Fiscal appealed the order to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Provincial Fiscal has the authority to conduct a preliminary investigation and file an information for a case previously dismissed by the Justice of the Peace Court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal of a charge by the Justice of the Peace Court stands as if no charge had been made, and therefore, the Provincial Fiscal is not precluded from conducting his own investigation of the same charge under Republic Act No. 732 [5]. Relying on *People v. Perez*, the Court emphasized that such dismissal creates no bar to another prosecution [6]. This is distinguishable from cases where the JP Court finds a prima facie case and binds the defendant over to the CFI, in which instance the Fiscal need not conduct another investigation [7].

The order appealed from is set aside and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [5].
