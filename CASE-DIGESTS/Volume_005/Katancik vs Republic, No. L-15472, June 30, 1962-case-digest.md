**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADOPTION OF THE MINOR JOSEPH AGULLO, S/SGT. K. KATANCIK v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-15472, June 30, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner S/Sgt. K. Katancik is an American citizen serving in the United States Air Force at Clark Field, Pampanga [1]. Assigned to the base since September 11, 1957, he lives with his Filipino wife and has three years remaining in his service [1]. He manifested an intention to reside permanently in the Philippines after his discharge to work as a civilian employee [1]. Katancik filed a petition to adopt the minor Joseph Agullo, which was granted by the Justice of the Peace Court of Clark Field and affirmed by the Court of First Instance of Pampanga [1, 2]. The Republic appealed, arguing that Katancik is a non-resident alien disqualified from adopting under Article 335 of the Civil Code, as his stay is merely temporary and conditioned on his military assignment [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner is a non-resident alien disqualified to adopt under Philippine laws.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner is a non-resident alien and is therefore disqualified to adopt [4, 5]. Relying on the ruling in *Caraballo v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-15080), the Court established that where a petitioner's stay in the Philippines is merely temporary and conditioned on his assignment with the United States Air Forces, he is a non-resident alien incapable of adopting a minor in this country [5]. Despite Katancik's stated intention to stay permanently after his future discharge, his current status is determined by his military assignment [1, 5].

The decision appealed from is reversed, and the petition for adoption is denied [6].
