I. CAPTION
**JOSEFA DULAY, assisted by her husband SEBASTIAN SOLOMON vs. PEDRO C. MERRERA, in his capacity as Register of Deeds of the Province of Pangasinan**, G.R. No. L-17084, August 30, 1962, Paredes, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Juan Dulay and his wife Teodora Bautista owned a parcel of registered land in San Carlos, Pangasinan [2]. Upon Juan's death, Josefa, Petra, and Teodora (claiming to be the only heirs) executed an "Extra-judicial Settlement of the Estate... with Absolute Sale" in 1956, resulting in the issuance of a new title (TCT No. 21067) in Josefa Dulay's name [2, 3]. On April 19, 1960, the same parties presented a document titled "Reformation of Extra-judicial Settlement" to the Register of Deeds, admitting the existence of two other legal heirs, Restituto and Cecilia Dulay, to annul the legal effects of the previous settlement [3]. The Register of Deeds refused to register the document [3]. Josefa filed a petition for Mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan to compel registration [3]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the document was fatally defective because not all legitimate heirs had signed it and therefore could not be accepted for registration [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Register of Deeds may refuse to register a voluntary instrument based on its alleged invalidity or defectiveness. [5]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The duty of the Register of Deeds to register voluntary instruments is purely ministerial [6, 7]. Under Sections 56, 57, 58, and 59 of the Land Registration Act, the Register of Deeds is required to enter all deeds and voluntary instruments relating to registered lands into the entry book upon payment of the filing fee [5, 8]. Furthermore, Section 193 of the Administrative Code mandates the recording of instruments required or allowed by law [9]. If the Register of Deeds is in doubt regarding the propriety of recording a specific instrument, the correct procedure is to follow Section 200 of the Administrative Code (*consulta*), rather than refusing registration [9]. The Court held that the Register of Deeds has no authority to inquire into the validity or legality of the document presented; such refusal constitutes unlawful neglect of a duty resulting from an office, making Mandamus the proper remedy under Section 3, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court [3, 10].

The Order of the lower court is **REVERSED** [1].
