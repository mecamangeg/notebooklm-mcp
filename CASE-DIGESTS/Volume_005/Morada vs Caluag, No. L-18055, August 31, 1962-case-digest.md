**I. CAPTION**
FELIX MORADA v. HON. HERMOGENES CALUAG and J.M. TUASON & CO., INC., G.R. No. L-18055, August 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
On May 21, 1959, respondent J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. filed a complaint (Civil Case No. Q-4473) in the Court of First Instance of Quezon City to recover possession of a parcel of land in the Santa Mesa Heights Subdivision from petitioner Felix Morada [1]. Morada alleged in his answer that he was the owner, claiming his wife acquired the land in 1946 from Roman Mendoza [2]. Subsequently, Morada filed a motion for leave to file a third-party complaint against Mendoza to enforce a warranty against eviction [3].

Respondent Judge Caluag denied the motion, ruling that since Morada’s answer admitted his wife—not him—bought the lot, Morada had no right to enforce the warranty, and his wife was not a party to the case [3]. The Judge also noted that the period to file such a complaint under Article 1559 of the New Civil Code had expired [4]. Morada filed a petition for Mandamus with the Supreme Court to compel the Judge to admit the third-party complaint [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the writ of mandamus lies to compel the trial judge to allow the filing of the third-party complaint.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the writ. The Court ruled that the admission of a third-party complaint rests within the sound discretion of the trial court under Section 1, Rule 12 of the Rules of Court [5]. Mandamus will not lie to control such discretion or compel a judge to decide a motion in a particular way, unless there is a clear legal right to the act demanded [4, 5].

Here, Morada failed to show a clear legal right because he admitted that his wife purchased the property. Consequently, there was no privity of contract between Morada and the proposed third-party defendant, Roman Mendoza [4]. The proper procedure would have been for Morada's wife to intervene in the action, after which she could have filed the third-party complaint against her vendor [4]. Because the petitioner lacked the legal right to enforce the warranty, the respondent Judge committed no error in denying the motion.

The petition for mandamus is **DENIED** and the preliminary injunction is **DISSOLVED** [6].
