I. CAPTION
THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. ANTONIO CAMPOS RUEDA, G.R. No. L-13250, May 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Maria de la Estrella Soriano Vda. de Cerdeira, a Spanish citizen and resident of Tangier (North Africa), died in 1955 leaving real and intangible personal properties in the Philippines. Respondent Antonio Campos Rueda, administrator of her estate, paid estate and inheritance taxes on the real properties but refused to pay on the intangibles, claiming exemption under Section 122 of the Tax Code due to reciprocity [1]. The Collector of Internal Revenue assessed deficiency taxes of P161,874.95 [1]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) reversed the Collector, ruling that the estate was exempt as Tangier granted reciprocal exemptions [2]. To prove reciprocity, Respondent submitted certificates stating that under Tangier laws, transfers of "bienes muebles" (movables) are not subject to inheritance tax [3, 4]. The Collector appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the reciprocity requirement for tax exemption under Section 122 of the Tax Code was sufficiently satisfied by the proofs of Tangier laws on "bienes muebles."

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that Section 122 of the Tax Code (as amended by R.A. No. 83) grants exemption on intangible personal property only if the decedent's foreign country grants a similar exemption in respect of "intangible personal property" owned by non-resident Filipino citizens [5]. The certificates submitted by the respondent referred to "bienes muebles," "movables," and "movable property" [4]. The Court could not determine legally whether these terms under Tangier law include or embrace "intangible personal property" as used in the Philippine Tax Code [4, 6]. Proof must be adduced to determine the scope of the foreign law's terminology to satisfy the reciprocity requirement.

Case REMANDED to the Court of Tax Appeals for reception of evidence [4, 7].
