I. CAPTION
VIVENCIO LASALA and ESTELA FRANCISCO DE LASALA v. HON. JOSE F. FERNANDEZ, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, REMIGIO PILLADO and PEDRO SARNATE, G.R. No. L-16628, May 23, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Spouses Lasala filed Civil Case No. 2458 in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental against respondents Remigio Pillado and Pedro Sarnate for recovery of possession of a lot and damages [1]. In 1954, the CFI issued a writ of preliminary injunction ordering respondents to desist from committing acts of dispossession against the petitioners [1]. Subsequently, respondents were allowed to continue in possession upon filing bonds for the 1956 and 1957 harvests [2].

However, when petitioners moved for another bond for the 1958 crop, respondent Judge Fernandez issued an order on March 17, 1959, setting aside the previous order requiring a bond [3, 4]. The Judge declared that the original writ of preliminary injunction had been "improvidently issued" because it was found that the respondents (and their parents before them) had been in actual possession of the lot, while petitioners had never been in possession [4, 5]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the court could not set aside the previous orders [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court has the power to recall or modify a writ of preliminary injunction previously issued on the ground that it was improvidently issued.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court acted correctly. The purpose of a writ of preliminary injunction is to maintain or preserve the *status quo* of the parties in relation to the subject matter during the pendency of the action [5, 6]. In this case, since the respondents were in actual possession of the land and the petitioners had never been in possession, the original injunction disturbed the status quo rather than preserved it [5, 7]. Consequently, the writ was improvidently issued [5].

Regarding the court's authority, Section 7 of Rule 60 of the Rules of Court expressly provides that after hearing, the court may "grant or refuse, continue, modify or dissolve the injunction as justice may require" [7, 8]. Citing *Aquino vs. Alvendia*, the Court reiterated that the issuance or recall of a preliminary writ of injunction is an interlocutory matter that remains at all times within the control of the court [8].

The petition is **DENIED** [8, 9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Justices Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, and Dizon concurred; Justice Labrador took no part) [8, 10].
