**I. CAPTION**
**EMILIO MENDENILLA v. JOSE MANUEL ONANDIA**, G.R. No. L-17803, June 30, 1962, 5 SCRA 537, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Mendenilla was the Chief of Police of the Municipality of Legaspi, appointed in 1954 by the Municipal Mayor [1]. On June 12, 1959, Republic Act No. 2234 took effect, converting the Municipality of Legaspi into the City of Legaspi [2]. The City Charter vested the power to appoint the Chief of Police in the President of the Philippines [2].

In February 1960, the President designated Mendenilla as *Acting* Chief of Police, retroactive to the Charter's effectivity [3]. Subsequently, on March 18, 1960, the President terminated Mendenilla's acting designation and designated Respondent Onandia as Acting Chief of Police [4]. Onandia was later nominated and confirmed as the regular Chief of Police [5].

Mendenilla filed a petition for *quo warranto*, claiming he had a vested right to the office and security of tenure under the Civil Service Law and R.A. 557 [6, 7]. The Court of First Instance of Albay dismissed the petition, ruling that the municipal office was abolished upon the city's creation [8, 9].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the conversion of the Municipality of Legaspi into a City abolished the municipal office of the Chief of Police held by Petitioner.
2. W/N Petitioner was illegally removed from office in violation of his security of tenure.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The power to create or abolish municipal corporations resides in Congress [10]. When the City of Legaspi was created, the Municipality's legal personality was extinguished, abolishing all municipal offices not expressly saved by the Charter [9]. Section 96 of R.A. 2234 only excepted the Mayor, Vice-Mayor, and Municipal Board members. Applying the principle of *expressio unius est exclusio alterius*, the office of the municipal Chief of Police was deemed abolished [11]. The City Chief of Police is a new office with a different appointing authority (the President) [12].

2. **NO.** There is no removal because the office itself was abolished. Removal implies the office exists while the officer is separated from it; when an office is validly abolished, the incumbent’s right thereto is extinguished [13, 14]. No person has a vested right to a statutory office, and the Civil Service Law cannot prevent the Legislature from abolishing offices [15]. Furthermore, Petitioner accepted an appointment as *Acting* Chief of Police of the City [16]. A designation in an acting capacity is temporary and terminable at the pleasure of the appointing authority (*Mendez v. Ganzon*) [17]. Having accepted the acting designation, Petitioner is estopped from claiming the permanent position and cannot invoke R.A. 557, which applies only to permanent appointments [18].

**The decision of the lower court is AFFIRMED.**
