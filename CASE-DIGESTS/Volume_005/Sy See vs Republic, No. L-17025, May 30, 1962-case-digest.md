**I. CAPTION**
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION AS CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. SY SEE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-17025, May 30, 1962, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Sy See, born in China in 1917, arrived in the Philippines in 1926 and established residence in Cebu City [1, 2]. He filed a petition for naturalization, claiming exemption from filing a declaration of intention under Section 5 of the Naturalization Act (Commonwealth Act No. 473) on the grounds of continuous residence for over 30 years and enrollment of his children in government-recognized schools [1]. However, evidence showed that his two eldest children, Sy Un and Sy Kay, only arrived in the Philippines on July 10, 1959, as temporary visitors, and were enrolled in a Cebu high school only upon arrival [2, 3]. Furthermore, Sy See made frequent trips to China and Hong Kong between 1940 and 1959, staying for periods ranging from two to five months to visit his family [2, 4]. The Court of First Instance of Cebu granted the petition, but the Republic appealed, arguing Sy See was not exempt from filing a declaration of intention and failed to meet education and residence requirements [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a declaration of intention.
2. W/N the petitioner possesses the irreproachable character required for naturalization.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The petitioner is not exempt. Under Section 6 of the Naturalization Act, as amended, an applicant must give primary and secondary education to *all* his children in Philippine schools to be exempt from filing a declaration of intention [6]. Since Sy See's children only arrived and enrolled in July 1959, he failed to comply with this requirement [3, 6]. Additionally, his frequent and prolonged absences to visit his family abroad interrupted the "continuous residence" required by Section 5 of the Act [4]. Keeping his family and schooling his children in a foreign country indicates a lack of sincere desire to embrace Filipino customs and traditions [4].

2. **NO.** The petitioner committed a falsehood in a public instrument by stating in his application that he had enrolled his children in Philippine schools, when in fact they were in Hong Kong until July 1959 [7]. This falsehood demonstrates that he lacks the "irreproachable character" essential for admission as a Filipino citizen [7].

The decision appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the petition is **DISMISSED** [8].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
J. Concepcion concurs in the result [8].
