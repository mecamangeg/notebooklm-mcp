I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CUSTODIO REGAL AND DIONISIO REGAL, G.R. No. L-14753, July 31, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On August 31, 1958, Pio Abuyen and his wife Irene Abriol were walking in Sitio Omatobang, Tubabao, Samar, when a gunshot was fired. Pio was hit and cried out, "Odio [Custodio], if you did not hit me only by surprise." Irene saw the accused Custodio Regal and his son Dionisio Regal behind a guava tree, with Custodio aiming a gun at the victim [1]. Pio died on the spot [1]. The accused claimed alibi, asserting they were in Guiuan at the time of the incident [2]. The Court of First Instance of Samar convicted both father and son of murder and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua* [3]. They appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over the positive identification of Custodio Regal.
2. W/N Dionisio Regal is criminally liable as a co-principal based on his presence at the scene.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the defense of alibi has no weight against the positive identification of the culprit [4, 5]. Irene Abriol positively saw Custodio aiming the gun, and the victim recognized his assailant as evidenced by his dying declaration [1]. Furthermore, the witnesses presented to support the alibi were found to be unreliable [6, 7].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that where there is no proof of conspiracy, the "mere passive presence of the accused at the scene of the crime does not make him a co-principal" [4, 5]. The prosecution failed to establish conspiracy or active participation by Dionisio.

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** with respect to Custodio Regal but **REVERSED** with respect to Dionisio Regal, who is acquitted [8].
