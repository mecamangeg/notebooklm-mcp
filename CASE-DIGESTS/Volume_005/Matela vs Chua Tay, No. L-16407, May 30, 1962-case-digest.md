I. CAPTION
ARCADIO G. MATELA v. CHUA TAY, G.R. No. L-16407, May 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On January 13, 1959, respondent Chua Tay filed a petition for injunction and damages (Civil Case No. 38862) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against petitioner Arcadio Matela, a board member of the Central Cooperative Exchange, Inc., alleging that Matela solicited kickbacks from bidders [1, 2]. On February 19, 1959, Matela filed an Answer in Case No. 38862 with a counterclaim for moral damages and attorney's fees, claiming Chua Tay's allegations were libelous [3].

While the Manila case was pending, Matela filed a separate complaint on February 25, 1959, in the CFI of Rizal (Civil Case No. Q-4019) against Chua Tay [4]. This new complaint was based on the exact same allegations used in his counterclaim in the Manila case—that Chua Tay's averments were defamatory [4]. Chua Tay filed an Answer raising the defense of *lis pendens* (pendency of another action), followed by a Motion to Dismiss on the same ground [5, 6]. The trial court dismissed the Rizal case. Matela appealed, arguing the motion to dismiss was improper as it was filed after the Answer [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the complaint on the ground of the pendency of another action (*lis pendens*) was proper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that all requisites for *lis pendens* were present: (1) identity of parties; (2) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, founded on the same facts; and (3) identity such that judgment in one case would amount to *res judicata* in the other [8]. The Court cited *Olayvar v. Olayvar* to establish these requisites [8].

The Court explained that Matela's claim in the Rizal complaint was identical to his counterclaim in the pending Manila case [8]. A counterclaim partakes of the nature of a complaint, and to interpose a cause of action in a counterclaim and again invoke it in a separate complaint against the same party constitutes splitting a cause of action, which is not sanctioned by the rules (*Berses v. Villamera*) [8]. Regarding the procedural objection, the Court noted that the defense of *lis pendens* was already raised in Chua Tay's Answer, which was filed prior to the Motion to Dismiss, rendering the dismissal valid [9]. The orders appealed from were affirmed [9, 10].
