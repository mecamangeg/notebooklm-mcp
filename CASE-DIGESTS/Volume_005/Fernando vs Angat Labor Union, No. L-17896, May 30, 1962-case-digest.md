**I. CAPTION**
VALENTIN A. FERNANDO v. ANGAT LABOR UNION, G.R. No. L-17896, May 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 10, 1959, the Angat Labor Union, composed of employees of Angat-Manila Transportation (Angat), registered as a union [1]. When the union prepared collective bargaining proposals on February 20, 1959, the company’s officers discouraged them, promising to buy more buses if the proposals were withheld [1]. Manager Gorgonio Cruz threatened that the operator, Valentin Fernando, would sell the business if the union continued [1]. Shortly after, to avoid union demands, Angat sold the business to Villa-Rey Transit via a contract stipulating that the buyer assumed no obligation to the seller's employees [1, 2]. Consequently, Villa-Rey summarily dismissed 12 union members [2].

The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found Fernando and his officers guilty of unfair labor practice (ULP), rejecting their defense that the sale was due to operational losses, as they failed to produce books and the business was actually improving [1, 3]. The CIR ordered Fernando to pay back wages from March 11, 1959, until actual payment, but absolved Villa-Rey based on the sales contract [1, 2]. Fernando appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N Petitioner is liable for unfair labor practice despite the sale of the business to a third party.
2. W/N Petitioner is liable for back wages until the employees are reinstated by the buyer.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court held that the employer-employee relationship is not terminated by an illegal severance made to forestall a demand for collective bargaining [4]. If an employer is guilty of ULP when directly discharging employees, he cannot evade responsibility by indirectly causing that discharge through a sale to a company he knows is unwilling to accept his employees [4]. While labor contracts are generally *in personam* and not enforceable against a transferee, a transferor in bad faith is responsible for employees discharged in violation of the Industrial Peace Act (*Majestic Employees Association v. CIR*) [5].

2. **NO.** The Court reasoned that holding Petitioner liable for back wages until reinstatement by Villa-Rey Transit, over whom he has no control, would be unjust and could result in indefinite liability [6]. Equity dictates that the penalty be limited.

**Disposition:** The decision was **MODIFIED**. Petitioner was sentenced to pay the complainants **six (6) months' wages**, based on the reasonable expectancy that they would find other suitable employment within that period with the exercise of due diligence [6, 7].
