**I. CAPTION**
MAMERTA DE LA MERCED v. COURT OF APPEALS, EZEQUIEL M. SANTOS, and AMPARO MACAPAGAL, G.R. No. L-17757, May 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondents Ezequiel Santos and Amparo Macapagal filed a complaint in 1952 to recover Lot No. 395 of the Rizal Cadastre. They claimed ownership based on a December 26, 1923 decision by the cadastral court adjudicating the lot to Ezequiel’s parents, followed by a December 17, 1925 order directing the issuance of a certificate of title. However, no title was actually issued.

On the other hand, Petitioner Mamerta de la Merced (intervenor and heir of Juan de la Merced) claimed ownership based on Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 3462, issued to her father on October 10, 1931, pursuant to a homestead patent. This patent was granted after the cadastral court, on December 28, 1926, declared the same lot as public land without reopening the previous case. Juan de la Merced had served as the overseer for Santos' family.

The Court of First Instance initially ruled for Santos but amended its decision, holding that since no title was issued to Santos, the land remained public and was validly acquired by Merced through the homestead patent and prescription (20 years possession). The Court of Appeals reversed this, ruling that the 1923 adjudication made the land private and incontrovertible, invalidating the subsequent homestead patent.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the 1923 cadastral court decision adjudicating ownership to Santos vested title and rendered the land registered property, despite the non-issuance of a certificate of title, thus barring the subsequent homestead patent and acquisition by prescription.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals. Citing *Government of the Philippine Islands v. Abural*, the Court held that in cadastral proceedings, title of ownership is vested upon the owner upon the expiration of the period to appeal from the decision or adjudication by the cadastral court, without such appeal being perfected.

The 1923 decision adjudicating ownership to Santos and the 1925 order directing the issuance of the title were judicial acts. Once the decision became final, the land became registered property for all intents and purposes. Consequently, it ceased to be part of the public domain, and the Director of Lands had no authority to grant a homestead patent over it to Juan de la Merced. Furthermore, as registered property, it could not be lost by adverse possession or prescription.

**Petition DENIED.** Decision affirmed.
