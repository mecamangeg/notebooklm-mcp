I. CAPTION
HAO SUSIONG alias RAMON CUENCO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-13045, July 30, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Hao Su Siong, a Chinese citizen born in 1901, arrived in the Philippines in 1918 and has resided in Inopacan, Leyte since 1924. He is a merchant with an annual income of P1,000. He married Ng Chun in China in 1925, and they have 12 children. In 1956, he filed a petition for naturalization without filing a Declaration of Intention, claiming exemption due to his continuous residence of over 30 years.

During the trial, evidence showed that two of his children, Eulalia and Pedro, were enrolled at the "Cebu Chinese High School." Additionally, while his son Manuel was a college graduate, there was no proof of where Manuel received his primary and secondary education. Petitioner also failed to present the birth certificates of his children to prove their ages and legitimacy. The Court of First Instance of Leyte granted the petition. The Republic appealed, questioning his exemption from filing a declaration of intention and his qualifications.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a declaration of intention.
2. W/N the petitioner satisfies the lucrative trade requirement under the Naturalization Law.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Section 5 of the Revised Naturalization Law requires a declaration of intention unless the applicant is exempt. Under Section 6, exemption requires continuous residence for 30 years AND that the applicant has given all his children primary and secondary education in government-recognized schools not limited to any race or nationality. The petitioner failed to meet this requirement for three reasons:
    (a) He failed to submit birth certificates, which are the best evidence of the children's ages and legitimacy [1];
    (b) He failed to prove that his son Manuel pursued primary and secondary education in the Philippines in schools where Philippine history and civics are taught [1]; and
    (c) He enrolled two children in the "Cebu Chinese High School," which conveys the impression that it is exclusive to Chinese students. This violates the requirement that the schools must not be limited to any race or nationality and affects the sincerity of the petitioner's intention to become a Filipino [2].

2. **NO.** An annual income of P1,000 is not lucrative enough for a petitioner with a wife and 12 children to support. The Court cited *Ngo Bun Ho v. Republic*, where even an income of P3,000 was deemed insufficient for a smaller family [3].

Accordingly, the decision of the lower court is REVERSED and the petition for naturalization is DISMISSED.
