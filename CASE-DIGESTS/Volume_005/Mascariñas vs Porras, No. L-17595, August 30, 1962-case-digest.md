**I. CAPTION**
RAFAEL MASCARIÑAS v. CARMELO L. PORRAS, G.R. No. L-17595, August 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
On January 5, 1960, Davao City Mayor Carmelo L. Porras issued a memorandum detailing three police officers to the "Illegal Fishing Unit" to enforce fishing laws and requiring them to submit periodic reports directly to his office [1, 2]. Only a copy of the memorandum was furnished to the petitioner, Chief of Police Rafael Mascariñas [3]. Mascariñas, believing this infringed upon his direct control over the police force, filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance of Davao to annul the memorandum [4]. The lower court denied the petition, ruling that under the City Charter and the doctrine in *Porras v. Avellana*, the Mayor has the power to do directly what he is empowered to do through the Chief of Police [5]. Mascariñas appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the City Mayor of Davao has the power of control over the Chief of Police such that he can directly detail police officers and require them to report to him.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision [6]. Under Sections 9, 16, and 33 of the Davao City Charter (Commonwealth Act No. 51, as amended), the Mayor is vested with "immediate control" over the executive and administrative functions of different departments, including the police department [7, 8].

The Court distinguished "supervision" from "control" citing *Mondano v. Silvosa*: supervision is merely overseeing that duties are performed, whereas **control** is the power to alter, modify, nullify, or set aside what a subordinate has done and substitute the superior's judgment for that of the subordinate [9]. The Mayor's power under the Charter includes both supervision and immediate control, which is broad enough to justify interference with the functions of the Chief of Police when necessary in the interest of the service [10]. Therefore, the Mayor was justified in directly issuing the memorandum to fill positions in the Illegal Fishing Unit [10].

**Decision affirmed.**
