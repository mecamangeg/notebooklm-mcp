I. CAPTION
GONZALO SANTOS RIVERA, et al. v. ANTONIO J. VILLEGAS, G.R. No. L-17835, May 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, members of the Municipal Board of Manila, filed a petition against Respondent Antonio J. Villegas, the Vice-Mayor and Presiding Officer of said Board. Petitioners alleged that Respondent acted in excess of his powers by (1) actively participating in deliberations and giving his opinion on measures under discussion, claiming he had a right to speak "like any other member," and (2) inserting unauthorized matters into a resolution regarding the suspension of traffic rules under Commonwealth Act No. 548. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Respondent, upholding his authority. Petitioners appealed. During the pendency of the case, Respondent became Mayor, rendering the specific issues moot, but the Supreme Court proceeded to decide the case based on public policy.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Vice-Mayor of Manila, as part of the Municipal Board, possesses the powers and attributes of a regular member, such as the right to participate in debates.

IV. RULING
**NO.** While the Vice-Mayor of Manila forms part of the Municipal Board under Section 13 of the Revised Charter of Manila (Republic Act No. 1571), he is a member *only* as the "presiding officer." He does not possess the status of a regular member or the powers and attributes of a municipal councilor. He has no more than the prerogatives and authority of a presiding officer and those specifically granted by law: to vote in case of a tie and to sign ordinances or resolutions.

However, the Court affirmed that as Presiding Officer, Respondent had the right to state reasons for his rulings on points of order (citing Robert's Rules of Order) and the duty to authenticate the will of the Board by framing resolutions that reflect the body's intent. The lower court's decision was **MODIFIED** to clarify that while the specific acts challenged were valid exercises of the Presiding Officer's duties, the Vice-Mayor is not a regular member with general debating rights.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Padilla, Bautista Angelo, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Paredes, and Dizon concurred.
