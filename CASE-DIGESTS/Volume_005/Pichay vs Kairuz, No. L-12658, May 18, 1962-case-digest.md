I. CAPTION
FORTUNATO PICHAY, ET AL. v. MICHAEL S. KAIRUZ, G.R. No. L-12658, May 18, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Fortunato Pichay and his co-plaintiffs filed Civil Case No. 454 in the Court of First Instance of Baguio to annul a special power of attorney and a deed of mortgage, alleging that their consent was obtained through fraud and intimidation [1]. Prior to this, Michael Kairuz had filed Civil Case No. 423 against Pichay, et al. to recover money, involving the same parties and documents [1, 2]. In Case 423, Pichay, et al. raised the defense that the documents were void due to fraud and duress—the same ground used for their complaint in Case 454 [1].

Kairuz moved to dismiss Case 454 due to the pendency of another action [1]. The trial court deferred the motion until Case 423 was decided. Eventually, judgment was rendered in Case 423 declaring the documents void and awarding damages and attorney's fees to Pichay, et al. [2]. Despite obtaining this favorable judgment, Pichay, et al. insisted on prosecuting Case 454 [2]. The trial court subsequently dismissed Case 454 and ordered Pichay, et al. to pay Kairuz P500.00 in attorney's fees for maintaining an unfounded action [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal of the complaint on the ground of *res judicata* was proper.
2. W/N the award of attorney's fees against the plaintiffs was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The dismissal was proper because the two cases involved the same parties, the same subject matter, and the same cause of action [2]. In Civil Case No. 423, the validity of the specific power of attorney and mortgage deed was already litigated [2]. Since judgment had been rendered in the first case—granting Pichay, et al. the very relief they sought in the second case (annulment of the documents) plus damages—the second action is barred by *res judicata* [2, 4]. The Court noted that the appellants' insistence on prosecuting the second case despite having already won in the first was "beyond comprehension" [2].

2. **YES.** The award of attorney's fees was justified because the action was completely unfounded [5]. The trial court had warned the plaintiffs repeatedly that the issues were identical to those in the pending Civil Case No. 423 and that the case should not proceed [5]. The plaintiffs' obstinate insistence on going ahead despite these warnings justified the penalty of attorney's fees [5].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [6].
