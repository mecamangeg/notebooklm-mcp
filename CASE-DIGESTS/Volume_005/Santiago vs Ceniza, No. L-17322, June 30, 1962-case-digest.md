I. CAPTION
IGNACIO SANTIAGO v. EULOGIA CENIZA, FRANCISCA TABLADA and ERIBERTO UNSON, G.R. No. L-17322, June 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellant Ignacio Santiago and defendants-appellees Eulogia Ceniza et al. were parties to previous civil cases regarding a property dispute. In February 1951, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao rendered a decision declaring a house as common property and ordering Santiago to pay monthly rentals for the land [1]. The Court of Appeals affirmed this decision on July 30, 1955, and the judgment became final and executory [2].

On January 8, 1959, Santiago filed an action for annulment of the judgment with the CFI of Davao, alleging that the decision requiring him to pay rentals was contrary to the Public Land Act [2]. The lower court dismissed the action, ruling that while the decision might be erroneous, such error does not justify annulment once the judgment is final, and the proper remedy should have been an appeal [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a final and executory judgment may be annulled on the ground that it is contrary to law or erroneous.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal order. A final and executory judgment may only be set aside or annulled if: (a) the judgment is void for want of jurisdiction or for lack of due process of law, or (b) it had been obtained by fraud [4, 5]. Aside from the reliefs provided in Rule 38 of the Rules of Court, there are no other means to renew litigation for a final judgment [4].

In this case, the lower court had jurisdiction over the subject matter. Even if the decision was erroneous as alleged, such point does not justify annulment. The remedy of the injured party should have been an appeal. Since the judgment had already been set at rest, the plaintiff cannot be allowed to drag matters that are already final [3, 6].

**Order affirmed.**
