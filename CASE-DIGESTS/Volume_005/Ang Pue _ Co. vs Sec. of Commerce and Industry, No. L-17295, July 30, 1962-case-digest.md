I. CAPTION
ANG PUE & COMPANY, ET AL. v. SECRETARY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY, G.R. No. L-17295, July 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On May 1, 1953, Ang Pue and Tan Siong, both Chinese citizens, organized the partnership Ang Pue & Company for a term of five years, extendible by mutual consent [1]. The partnership engaged in the wholesale and retail of general merchandise. On June 19, 1954, Republic Act No. 1180 was enacted, prohibiting foreigners from engaging in the retail trade but allowing existing non-Filipino partnerships to continue business until the expiration of their term [2]. On April 15, 1958, prior to the expiration of the original term, the partners amended the articles of partnership to extend its life for another five years [2]. The Securities and Exchange Commission refused to register the amendment for violating R.A. 1180 [2]. The petitioners filed an action for declaratory relief, which the Court of First Instance of Iloilo dismissed [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the partnership may extend its term for another five years despite the enactment of R.A. 1180.

IV. RULING
**NO.** To organize a corporation or partnership is not a matter of absolute right but a privilege which may be enjoyed only under terms imposed by the State [4]. R.A. 1180 was validly enacted by Congress to limit the retail business to Filipinos, and it clearly intended to allow existing foreign partnerships to operate only until the expiration of their current term [4]. The provision in the original articles allowing for extension is not a property right protected from subsequent legislation; the agreement to extend is subject to the law existing at the time the extension is made [5]. Since R.A. 1180 was already in force when the partners attempted to extend the term in 1958, the extension violates the clear intent and purpose of the Act [5].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [6].
