**I. CAPTION**
MANUEL S. CAMUS v. PRICE, INC. / PRICE, INC. v. COURT OF APPEALS and MANUEL S. CAMUS, G.R. Nos. L-17858-9 & L-17865-6, July 18, 1962, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
On March 30, 1951, Manuel S. Camus (Lessor) and Price, Inc. (Lessee) entered into a 10-year lease contract. The Lessee agreed to construct a factory and warehouse on the lot and insure the buildings for P50,000.00 [1, 2]. The Lessor agreed to fill a 500-square-meter vacant portion of the lot and construct a concrete stone wall with barbed wire within one year [3].

In January 1954, the Lessee filed for specific performance, claiming the Lessor failed to complete the filling and fencing. Three days later, the Lessor filed for unlawful detainer (ejectment) due to the Lessee's failure to pay rent since February 16, 1953 [4]. The Court of Appeals found that the Lessor failed to strictly comply with the construction specifications (using adobe instead of concrete, no barbed wire, incomplete filling) [5]. However, the Lessee also failed to insure the buildings and pay rent [6]. The CA declared the parties in *pari delicto*, extinguishing the contract, but ordered the Lessee to pay P200.00 monthly for the continued use of the premises [7]. Both parties appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the parties are in *pari delicto* such that the contract is deemed extinguished.
2. W/N the Lessee is liable to pay compensation for the occupancy of the premises despite the extinguishment of the contract.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed that both parties defaulted in the performance of their reciprocal duties. The Lessor failed to complete the filling and fencing according to the agreed specifications, while the Lessee failed to insure the buildings and pay rentals [6]. Since it could not be determined with definiteness who committed the first infraction, the parties are in *pari delicto*. Consequently, the contract is deemed extinguished, and the parties must bear their respective losses [8, 9].

2. **YES.** Although the contract was extinguished, the Lessee remained in continuous occupancy of the premises during the pendency of the case, operating its business and profiting thereby [10]. Conversely, the Lessor was deprived of both possession and rentals. Justice requires that the Lessee compensate the Lessor for such occupancy until it vacates the premises. The Court affirmed the award of P200.00 per month as reasonable compensation [10, 11].

**Decision affirmed.**
