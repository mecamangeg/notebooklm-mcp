I. CAPTION
THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. THE CLUB FILIPINO, INC. DE CEBU, G.R. No. L-12719, May 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Club Filipino, Inc. de Cebu (Club) is a civic corporation organized to develop sports and recreation for its members [1]. It operates a clubhouse with a bar and restaurant that caters exclusively to its members and their guests [2]. The Club is funded mainly by membership fees and dues, distributes no cash dividends, and uses any revenue from the bar and restaurant to defray overhead expenses and improve its facilities [2, 3]. Upon dissolution, its assets are to be donated to a charitable institution [1].

In 1952, the Petitioner Collector of Internal Revenue (Collector) assessed the Club P12,068.84 for fixed and percentage taxes, surcharges, and a compromise penalty pursuant to Sections 182, 183, and 191 of the Tax Code, classifying it as a "keeper of bar and restaurant" [4, 5]. The Club requested cancellation of the assessment, which was denied [5]. The Club then filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), which reversed the Collector's decision and ruled that the Club was not liable [4]. The Collector petitioned the Supreme Court for review [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Club is liable for fixed and percentage taxes as a business operator of a bar and restaurant. [5]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals [6]. Liability for fixed and percentage taxes under Sections 182, 183, and 191 of the Tax Code does not automatically attach to the operation of a bar and restaurant; the operator must be engaged in the "business" of being a barkeeper and restaurateur [7]. The plain and ordinary meaning of "business" is restricted to activities where profit or livelihood is the purpose [8].

The Court found that the Club was organized for the healthful recreation of members, catered only to members and guests, and did not distribute dividends [2]. The fact that it is a stock corporation is not determinative; the actual purpose, shown by extrinsic evidence (bylaws and operation), controls [9]. Furthermore, lacking authority to distribute dividends to shareholders, it is not strictly a stock corporation under the Corporation Law [10]. Since the Club is not engaged in business for profit, it is not liable for the taxes or penalties assessed [11].
