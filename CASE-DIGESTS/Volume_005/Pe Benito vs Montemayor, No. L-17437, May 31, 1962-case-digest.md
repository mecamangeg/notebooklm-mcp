I. CAPTION
MENO PEBENITO v. PRESIDENT ZOSIMO MONTEMAYOR of the MINDANAO AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE, G.R. No. L-17437, May 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Meno Pe Benito, a temporary instructor at Mindanao Agricultural College, filed a petition for Mandamus and Prohibition against the College President, Zosimo Montemayor, to prevent his termination from service [1]. Montemayor filed an answer asserting his authority to dispense with temporary employees but appeared at the hearing without counsel [2], [3]. Unaware of legal procedure, Montemayor submitted the case on the pleadings without presenting evidence [3], [4]. The lower court ruled in favor of Pe Benito, ordering his reinstatement and salary payment [3].

The Solicitor General subsequently filed a petition for relief from judgment, arguing that Montemayor’s failure to notify the Office of the Solicitor General and his act of appearing alone constituted mistake and excusable negligence, as the case involved official acts of government officials [5], [6]. The lower court denied the petition for relief, prompting this appeal [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for relief from judgment based on mistake and excusable negligence should be granted.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the ends of justice would be better served by granting the relief. Montemayor was not a lawyer and was unfamiliar with the technicalities of procedure or the law; he could not have known the implications of submitting the case only on the pleadings [4]. His appearance without the benefit of counsel amounted to a deprivation of the chance to be heard, constituting manifest mistake and excusable negligence [4], [7]. Citing *Alonzo v. Villamor*, the Court emphasized that "[l]egal rights are too valuable to be risked, and should not be chanced on a toss of coins or dice" [7].

Accordingly, the order denying the motion for relief from judgment was set aside, and the case was remanded to the court of origin for a new trial [7].
