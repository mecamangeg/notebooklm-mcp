I. CAPTION
NATIONAL LABOR UNION v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and DURABLE SHOE FACTORY, G.R. No. L-14975, May 15, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In a previous decision (G.R. No. L-7783), the Supreme Court upheld the reinstatement of three employees of Durable Shoe Factory (Severo Santos, Emiliano Lopez, and Amando Balagtas) but remanded the case to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) for a new trial to determine the duration of back wages and the fact of the factory's closure.

Upon remand, the CIR found that the factory had legitimately closed on December 6, 1952, and did not reopen until October 1955 with different manufacturing processes. Consequently, the CIR ruled that reinstatement was no longer possible and limited back wages to the period before the closure, deducting earnings the workers obtained from other employment.

Petitioner National Labor Union appealed, arguing that the CIR erred in accepting the examiner’s report based on payrolls the company refused to produce during the first trial, claiming this constituted suppression of evidence. Petitioner also argued that worker Emiliano Lopez should receive full back wages for his period of unemployment without deductions.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the presumption that suppressed evidence is unfavorable applies to the payrolls produced only during the rehearing.
2. W/N the Supreme Court should review the factual findings of the CIR regarding the business closure.
3. W/N the deduction of earnings from other employment from the back wages is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The presumption that suppressed evidence is unfavorable does not apply when the evidence allegedly suppressed is actually exhibited at a subsequent hearing [1]. There was no proof that the payrolls presented were not genuine. Furthermore, the CIR’s decision was supported by other evidence, such as lease contracts and testimonies regarding the closure [1].

2. **NO.** The issues raised regarding the closure and back wages are factual in nature. It is a settled rule that as long as there is evidence to support the decision of the CIR, the Supreme Court will not interfere, modify, or reverse it, even if the evidence is not overwhelming. The Court's province is limited to resolving questions of law (*Dee C. Chuan vs. Nahag*) [2].

3. **YES.** The deduction is proper. The argument that Lopez is entitled to full compensation without deduction should have been raised in the first appeal (G.R. No. L-7783). The previous ruling established that earnings obtained in other employment should be deducted from back wages. This ruling has become final and is *res judicata*, making it no longer subject to reversal or modification [3].

The decision of the Court of Industrial Relations is **AFFIRMED** [4].
