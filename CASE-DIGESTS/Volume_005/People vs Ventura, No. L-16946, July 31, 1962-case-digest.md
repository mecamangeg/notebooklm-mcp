I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GUILLERMO I. VENTURA, G.R. No. L-16946, July 31, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Guillermo I. Ventura operated the "Ventura Drugless Clinic" in Manila without securing a mayor's permit, sanitary health permit, or municipal license. He was charged with violating Ordinance No. 3000. Ventura argued that because a clinic engaged in drugless healing or physiotherapy was not specifically enumerated in Section 3 of the ordinance, he was not required to obtain a permit. The Court of First Instance of Manila found him guilty and sentenced him to pay a fine. Ventura appealed, also contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on "newly discovered evidence"—specifically, a BIR ruling and receipt showing he paid occupation tax as a "masseur."

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the operation of a drugless clinic requires a mayor's permit under Ordinance No. 3000 even if not explicitly listed.
2. W/N the payment of an occupation tax as a masseur exempts the operator from securing a mayor's permit.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The coverage of Ordinance No. 3000 is not limited to the specific businesses listed therein but extends to "all other businesses, trades or occupations... upon which the City is empowered to license or impose tax" [1]. The purpose of the permit is to ensure proper supervision by municipal authorities regarding sanitation, security, and public welfare [2]. A clinic treating human afflictions involves direct contact with the public and therefore falls within the contemplation of "other occupations" subject to city regulation and the permit requirement [2], [3].

2. **NO.** Payment of the occupation tax under the National Internal Revenue Code does not authorize the operation of a clinic without a mayor's permit [4]. The ordinance (No. 3398) that previously allowed such an exemption was repealed by Ordinance No. 3646 [4]. Furthermore, even if Ventura is considered a "masseur" by his tax payment, Ordinance No. 3659 explicitly requires a permit for the operation of massage clinics [5]. The motion for new trial was correctly denied as the evidence would not alter the result.

The decision of the lower court is AFFIRMED [5].
