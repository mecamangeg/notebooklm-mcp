I. CAPTION
RIO Y COMPANIA (Successor to RIO Y OLABARRIETA) v. COURT OF APPEALS and MANUEL REY, G.R. No. L-15666, June 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rio y Compania filed an action against respondent Manuel Rey in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Palawan to recover P16,811.89 plus interest and to foreclose a mortgage guaranteeing the loan. The mortgage obligation became due on February 11, 1940 (including a one-year extension). The complaint was filed on April 10, 1954. Rey sought dismissal on the ground of prescription. The CFI dismissed the complaint, finding the action had prescribed. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed, deducting only the "short moratorium" period (March 10, 1945 to July 26, 1948) from the prescriptive period. The CA ruled that the "long moratorium" did not apply because the petitioner failed to prove that Rey was a war sufferer or war damage claimant, which was necessary to invoke the extended tolling of the prescription period under the Moratorium Law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the burden of proof is on the defendant to show he is *not* a war sufferer or war damage claimant to successfully invoke prescription.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that since the respondent set up the defense of prescription, it was incumbent upon him to plead and prove that he was *not* covered by the Moratorium Law (Republic Act No. 342) to establish that the plaintiff's action was barred. Citing *Rio y Compania v. Datu Jolipli* (G.R. No. L-12301), the Court ruled that while being a "non-war sufferer" is a negative averment, it is the essence of the contention that the claim is barred, thus the burden lies with the defendant. Since Rey failed to prove he was not a war sufferer, the logical conclusion is that he was one. Consequently, the prescriptive period was tolled until May 18, 1953, when the Supreme Court declared R.A. 342 unconstitutional in *Rutter v. Esteban* (49 O.G. 1807). Applying this longer tolling period, the petitioner's action has not prescribed.

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings to determine the amount due.
