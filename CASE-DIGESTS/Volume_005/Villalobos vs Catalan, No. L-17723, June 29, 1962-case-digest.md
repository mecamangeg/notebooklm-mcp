**I. CAPTION**
JOSE S. VILLALOBOS v. MANUEL CATALAN, GRACIANA JUSAIN, CLARITA CATALAN AND MANUEL GRIÑEN, G.R. No. L-17723, June 29, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
On January 14, 1947, respondents spouses Catalan sold two parcels of land in Iloilo to petitioner Villalobos with a right of repurchase (pacto de retro) within 10 years [1]. During the cadastral hearing, the spouses dissuaded Villalobos from intervening, promising to transfer the titles to him if they failed to repurchase [1]. The New Civil Code took effect in 1950. In 1958, Villalobos discovered that the spouses had sold the properties to their daughter, Clarita Catalan, who secured a Transfer Certificate of Title and mortgaged the land [1]. Villalobos filed an action for annulment of sale and title [1]. The respondents moved to dismiss, arguing the action was moot because they had deposited the repurchase price with the Clerk of Court, invoking Article 1606, paragraph 3 of the New Civil Code, which allows vendors to repurchase within 30 days from final judgment if the contract is declared a true sale [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo dismissed the case, ruling the payment was timely under said Article [2]. Villalobos appealed [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Article 1606, paragraph 3 of the New Civil Code applies to a pacto de retro sale perfected before the Code’s effectivity but with a redemption period expiring after. [4]

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that a sale a retro under the Old Civil Code conferred upon the purchaser not a mere expectancy, but an actual right of ownership subject only to a resolutory condition (timely redemption) [5, 6]. Villalobos’ vested right of ownership could not be defeated or impaired by the new right created by Article 1606 of the New Civil Code [6].

The Court applied Article 2253 of the New Civil Code, which states that new rights declared in the Code are effective at once only if they do not prejudice or impair any vested or acquired right of the same origin [7]. Since applying Article 1606 would impair the purchaser's vested right to absolute ownership upon failure to redeem, it cannot be applied retroactively [8]. Furthermore, under Article 2255, conditional rights established under former laws continue to be subject to said laws [5].

The Order of dismissal was **SET ASIDE** and the records were **REMANDED** to the court of origin for trial and decision on the merits [9].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. [9]
