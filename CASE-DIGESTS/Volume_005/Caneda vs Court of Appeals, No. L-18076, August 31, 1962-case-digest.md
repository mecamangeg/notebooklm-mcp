I. CAPTION
ELEUTERIO CANEDA v. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. GREGORIO S. NARVASA, et al., G.R. No. L-18076, August 31, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Philippine-American General Insurance Co., Inc. (Philamgen) filed three civil cases in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against petitioner Eleuterio Caneda and others for the collection of sums of money [1]. Judgments were rendered against Caneda in all three cases [1, 2]. Caneda filed a petition for annulment of judgment and preliminary injunction with the Court of Appeals (CA), alleging that the CFI lacked jurisdiction over his person because he was never validly served with summons [1, 2]. He claimed that in one case, an unauthorized lawyer appeared for him, and in the others, a co-defendant received the summons without his authority [2]. The CA dismissed the petition, ruling that since the CFI decisions had already become final, the remedy sought was not "in aid of appellate jurisdiction" [3]. The CA also held that the validity of the service of summons was a factual issue requiring evidence, which should be raised in a separate civil action [3]. Caneda appealed to the Supreme Court via certiorari [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to entertain a petition for annulment of judgment and injunction "in aid of its appellate jurisdiction" even after the lower court's decision has become final.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CA's dismissal. Under Section 30 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, the Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, prohibition, injunction, certiorari, and habeas corpus "in aid of its appellate jurisdiction" [4]. The Court held that for this jurisdiction to exist, it is not necessary that a party has actually appealed; it is sufficient if the petitioner had a right to appeal according to law [5]. Since the amounts involved in the civil cases fell within the appellate jurisdiction of the CA, Caneda could have brought a timely appeal had he been properly notified [6].

The CA possesses supervisory power over CFIs and should exercise it to correct apparent errors affecting the validity of proceedings, such as the failure to serve summons [7]. The fact that evidence might need to be taken regarding the service of summons does not divest the CA of jurisdiction to entertain the petition [7]. The Supreme Court found that the certified copies of the summonses were sufficient to prove that the service was irregular and the judgments void [8].

**Petition granted; decisions declared null and void insofar as they affect the petitioner; preliminary injunction made permanent.** [9]
