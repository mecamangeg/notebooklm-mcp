I. CAPTION
NEMESIO AZUCENA v. SEVERINO POTENCIANO and LAGUNA TRANSPORTATION CO., G.R. No. L-14028, June 30, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Azucena filed a civil action for damages against defendants Potenciano (bus driver) and Laguna Transportation Co. (owner) following a collision between his scooter and the defendants' bus. The complaint was based on quasi-delict (culpa aquiliana) under Articles 2176 and 2180 of the Civil Code [1].

While the civil case was pending, Potenciano was acquitted in the criminal case for serious physical injuries with damage to property through reckless imprudence involving the same accident. The criminal court found that Potenciano did not act recklessly or negligently [2]. Consequently, the trial court dismissed Azucena's civil complaint, ruling that under Rule 107 of the Rules of Court, the judgment of acquittal in the criminal case operated as a bar to the civil action [2]. Azucena appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a civil action for damages based on quasi-delict is barred by the acquittal of the defendant in the criminal case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal and remanded the case.

The Court ruled that a civil action for quasi-delict acts independently of the criminal action. Under **Articles 31, 33, and 2177 of the Civil Code**, civil liability arising from negligence is entirely separate and distinct from civil liability arising from negligence under the Penal Code [3]. Article 33 specifically allows a civil action for physical injuries to proceed independently of the criminal prosecution and requires only a preponderance of evidence [4, 5].

To subordinate the civil action to the result of the criminal prosecution would render the independent character of the civil action under Article 31 meaningless [6]. The only exception, established in *Roa v. De la Cruz*, is when the offended party actively intervenes in the criminal suit to recover damages and fails to reserve the right to file a separate action; however, Azucena did not intervene in the criminal case [6]. Thus, the acquittal does not extinguish the civil liability based on quasi-delict.

**Disposition:** The order appealed from is set aside and the case is remanded to the Court of origin for further proceedings, with costs against defendants-appellees [7].
