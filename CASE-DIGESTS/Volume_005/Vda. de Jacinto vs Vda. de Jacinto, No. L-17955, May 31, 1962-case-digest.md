I cannot write a case digest for *Vda. de Jacinto v. Vda. de Jacinto* based on the provided source, as it only contains the case title and date [1]. It does not include the text of the decision, the facts, or the ruling required to generate the digest.

Would you like me to search for the full text or details of this case so I can create the digest for you?
