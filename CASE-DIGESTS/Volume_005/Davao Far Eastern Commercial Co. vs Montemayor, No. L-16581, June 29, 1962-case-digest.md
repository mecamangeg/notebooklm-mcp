**I. CAPTION**
DAVAO FAR EASTERN COMMERCIAL COMPANY v. ALBERTO C. MONTEMAYOR, Regional Labor Administrator No. 8; RAYMUNDO DAZA, Hearing Officer of the Regional Labor Office No. 8; and TIMOTEO CHATTO, G.R. No. L-16581, June 29, 1962, Padilla, J.

**II. FACTS**
On May 15, 1958, respondent Timoteo Chatto, a store helper, filed a complaint against petitioner Davao Far Eastern Commercial Company with Regional Office No. 8 of the Department of Labor in Davao City. Chatto sought P3,450.00 for underpaid wages and overtime compensation covering the period from May 15, 1955 to March 4, 1958 [1]. The Company moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, but the Regional Office denied the motion on February 23, 1959 [1].

Consequently, the Company filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao, arguing that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, which empowered the regional office to hear money claims, was unconstitutional [2]. On September 24, 1959, the CFI rendered judgment in favor of the Company, declaring the regional office without jurisdiction. The respondents appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Regional Office No. 8 of the Department of Labor has jurisdiction to hear and determine money claims for underpayment of wages and overtime pay under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's ruling, holding that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is unconstitutional insofar as it grants the Department of Labor and its regional offices the power or jurisdiction to hear and determine money claims, such as underpayment of wages and overtime pay [3], [4].

The Court relied on the settled doctrine in *Corominas, Jr. v. Labor Standard Commission* (G.R. No. L-14837, June 30, 1961) and *De Vera v. Supitran* (G.R. No. L-13945, July 31, 1961), which established that such regional offices have no authority to pass upon pure money claims [4], [5].

Judgment of the Court of First Instance of Davao is **AFFIRMED** [4], [6].
