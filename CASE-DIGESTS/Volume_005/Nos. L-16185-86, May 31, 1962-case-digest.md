I. CAPTION
TRUSTEESHIP OF THE MINORS BENIGNO, ANGELA and ANTONIO PEREZ Y TUASON; J. ANTONIO ARANETA v. ANTONIO M. PEREZ, G.R. Nos. L-16185-86, May 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
J. Antonio Araneta (appellee) was the trustee for the minors Benigno, Angela, and Antonio Perez y Tuason, while Antonio M. Perez (appellant) was their judicial guardian. Two incidents were appealed:
1.  **In G.R. No. L-16185**, the lower court authorized the payment of P5,500.00 to the law firm Araneta & Araneta, of which the trustee was a member, for legal services rendered in proceedings regarding the approval of accounts and objections raised by the appellant. The appellant objected, invoking Section 7 of Rule 86 of the Rules of Court, which prohibits an executor or administrator who is an attorney from charging professional fees against the estate.
2.  **In G.R. No. L-16186**, the trustee purchased 118 common shares of Philippine-American Drug Co. for the trust. The appellant objected, claiming the investment was unwise and constituted self-dealing because Araneta was personally a stockholder of said company. The lower court approved the accounts and the purchase.

III. ISSUE/S
1.  W/N a trustee who is a lawyer is prohibited by Rule 86 from charging attorney's fees against the trust estate for legal services rendered by his law firm.
2.  W/N the trustee's purchase of shares in a corporation where he is also a stockholder constitutes prohibited self-dealing.

IV. RULING
1.  **NO.** The Court held that Section 7 of Rule 86 refers specifically to "executors or administrators" and does not necessarily apply to trustees [1]. While their functions are analogous, the duties of executors are fixed by law, whereas the duties of trustees are governed by the intention of the trustor or parties pursuant to Art. 1441 of the Civil Code [2]. Applying the prohibition strictly could dissuade qualified persons from accepting trusteeships [3]. The better policy is to acknowledge the authority of courts to exercise sound judgment in allowing such fees. In this case, the will creating the trust explicitly granted the trustee the right to collect reasonable fees, and the services were rendered to defend the trustee in proceedings where his stand was upheld by the courts [4].

2.  **NO.** The Court ruled that the trustee’s interest was insufficient to constitute self-dealing. Araneta owned only 199 out of 30,000 common shares in his individual capacity [5]. This investment indicated he was managing the trust with the same care as his own property. Evidence showed the company was financially stable and had a history of paying dividends, proving the investment was not unwise [6].

The orders appealed from are **AFFIRMED** [7].
