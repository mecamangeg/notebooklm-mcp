I. CAPTION
COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. LA TONDEÑA, INC. and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-10431, July 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent La Tondeña, Inc., a licensed rectifier, purchased crude alcohol from sugar centrals to manufacture wines and liquors, such as "Manila Rum." In the process of rectifying this alcohol to produce high-quality finished products, losses were incurred due to evaporation. Petitioner Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed specific taxes totaling P154,663.10 on the alcohol lost through evaporation for the period from June 7, 1950, to February 7, 1954. La Tondeña protested the assessment and appealed to the Conference Staff of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. After the CIR effectively denied the administrative appeal by requiring a bond, La Tondeña filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) on March 18, 1955.

The CTA modified the assessment, ruling that La Tondeña was liable for the period before January 1, 1951, but exempt from specific taxes on losses incurred from January 1, 1951, to February 27, 1954, pursuant to Republic Act No. 592. The CIR appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the exemption and the jurisdiction of the CTA, arguing the petition was filed beyond the 30-day statutory period.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N La Tondeña is liable for specific taxes on alcohol lost through evaporation from January 1, 1951 to February 27, 1954.
2. W/N the Court of Tax Appeals had jurisdiction over the case regarding the timeliness of the appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that specific taxes should be based on the finished product, not on evaporated alcohol, during the contested period. Republic Act No. 592, which took effect on January 1, 1951, amended Section 133 of the Tax Code by deleting the clause "the tax shall attach to this substance as soon as it is in existence as such." This amendment manifested the legislative intent to subject only distilled spirits as finished products to specific tax [1]. The Court reasoned that if the law intended to tax losses, it would have retained the provision. Furthermore, Republic Act No. 1608, enacted on August 23, 1956, restored the provision taxing losses, implying that during the interim period (including the dates in question), such losses were not taxable [2]. In case of doubt, tax statutes are construed most strongly against the Government and in favor of the citizen [3].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the petition was filed on time. The administrative appeal to the Conference Staff of the Bureau of Internal Revenue suspended the running of the 30-day period to appeal to the CTA [4]. The period is counted from the date the taxpayer receives the final decision denying the administrative remedy. Since La Tondeña received the denial of its motion for reconsideration regarding the bond requirement on March 16, 1955, and filed with the CTA on March 18, 1955, the appeal was well within the period [5].

**Decision affirmed.**
