**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF ONG TE TO CHANGE HIS NAME. ONG TE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-15549, June 30, 1962, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Ong Te filed a petition to change his name in the Court of First Instance of Cagayan. He argued that there were several persons bearing the same name "Ong Te," specifically claiming that when securing a visa for Hongkong, he was told over 30 persons shared his name. He also alleged he had long been known by the name "Antonio." The trial court denied the petition on the sole ground that the petitioner was not given the name "Antonio" when he was baptized. Petitioner appealed this order to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N baptism with the desired name is a condition *sine qua non* for a change of name.
2. W/N the petitioner presented proper and reasonable cause to change his name.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that baptism is not a condition *sine qua non* to a change of name. To hold otherwise would render it impossible for persons to change their names if they were not baptized with the names they wish to adopt [1, 2].

2. **NO.** Despite rejecting the lower court's reasoning regarding baptism, the Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal because the petitioner failed to prove "proper and reasonable cause" as required by Rule 103, Section 5 of the Rules of Court [3].
   *   **Regarding duplication of names:** The petitioner failed to show how the alleged duplication of names prejudiced him in any way. His testimony regarding the Hongkong visa issue was unsupported by other evidence [2].
   *   **Regarding long use of name:** The Court reiterated that the mere fact that an applicant has been using a different name and has become known by it does not *per se* constitute proper and reasonable cause to authorize a change of name (*Ong Peng Oan v. Republic*) [4].
   *   **Regarding confusion:** The Court noted that the addition of "Ong Ang" after "Antonio" would likely cause more confusion than the use of his present name [4].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
*   **Makalintal, J.** concurred in the result only.
