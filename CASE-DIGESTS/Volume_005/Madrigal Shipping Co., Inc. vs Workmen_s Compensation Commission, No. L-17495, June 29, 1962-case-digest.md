I. CAPTION
MADRIGAL SHIPPING CO., INC. v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and PRIMITIVA MENCHAVEZ, et al., G.R. No. L-17495, June 29, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Celso Lora, a laborer, was accidentally killed while performing stevedoring work on board the vessel "Susana," owned by Madrigal Shipping Co., Inc. (Madrigal) [1]. Primitiva Menchavez, his widow, filed a claim for compensation with Regional Office No. 8 of the Department of Labor [1, 2]. The Regional Office awarded compensation, which the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed en banc [2, 3].

Madrigal appealed, arguing that: (1) the Regional Office lacked authority to investigate the claim because Reorganization Plan 20-A was unconstitutional; and (2) there was no employer-employee relationship because Madrigal had contracted with the "Union de Obreros Estivadores de Filipinas" (UOEF) to furnish stevedores, and the Union assigned the deceased to the task [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Regional Office No. 8 had jurisdiction over the compensation claim under Reorganization Plan 20-A.
2. W/N Madrigal Shipping Co., Inc. is liable as the employer of the deceased despite the contract with the Union.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Reorganization Plan 20-A validly reapportioned jurisdiction over compensation claims, formerly held by the WCC alone, to the various regional offices created under said plan. The Court reiterated the doctrine laid down in *La Mallorca v. Ramos* and *San Miguel Brewery v. Sobremesana* upholding this jurisdiction [3].

2. **YES.** The contract between Madrigal and the Union, where the latter engaged to furnish laborers, did not constitute the Union as an independent contractor to relieve Madrigal of liability [4]. The Union acted merely as an agent; it had no capital of its own invested in the hiring activities nor did it file a contractor's bond required by Act 3059 [4]. Furthermore, Madrigal retained control of the operations, as the captain directed the unloading and loading of the vessel [5]. Under Section 39(a) of the Workmen's Compensation Law, indirect employment is no bar to liability (*Flores v. La Compania Maritima*) [5].

The decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission is affirmed [6].
