I. CAPTION
LEONARD M. STOLL, ET AL. v. ATANACIO A. MARDO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17241, June 29, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Andres Moran filed a claim for overtime pay, vacation leave, and separation pay against petitioners Leonard M. Stoll, et al. with Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor [1]. Instead of answering the summons, petitioners filed a special action for prohibition with preliminary injunction before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal [1]. They questioned the authority of the hearing officer, arguing that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, which granted such authority, was null and void for being an unlawful delegation of legislative power and for failing to observe the constitutional procedure for passing statutes [2]. The CFI ruled in favor of petitioners, declaring Reorganization Plan No. 20-A null and void insofar as it confers judicial power, and permanently enjoined the labor officials from hearing the claim [3]. Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Department of Labor hearing officials are legally vested with authority by Reorganization Plan No. 20-A to hear and adjudicate money claims.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is invalid insofar as it confers judicial powers upon labor officials to pass upon labor claims other than those falling under the Workmen's Compensation Commission [4]. This grant of authority constitutes an undue delegation of legislative power not contemplated by Republic Act No. 997, as amended [4]. The Court reiterated its rulings in *Corominas v. Labor Standard Commission* and *Miller v. Mardo*, emphasizing that the failure of Congress to disapprove the reorganization plan did not validate it as a statute, as it was not passed in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the Constitution [4].

The decision of the lower court is AFFIRMED [5].
