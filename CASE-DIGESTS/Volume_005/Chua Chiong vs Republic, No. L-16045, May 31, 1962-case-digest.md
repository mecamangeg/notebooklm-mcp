I. CAPTION
CHUA CHIONG alias JUAN CHUA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16045, May 31, 1962, Dizon, J. [1-3]

II. FACTS
Chua Chiong, a Chinese citizen born in 1923 who has resided in the Philippines since 1933, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Cagayan on May 21, 1958 [3, 4]. He claimed to speak Ilocano, Chinese, and a little English and National Language, and asserted his belief in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution [5]. The lower court granted his petition [3]. The Republic appealed, arguing Chua failed to prove the requisite qualifications [3]. During the proceedings, it was revealed that Chua needed an interpreter for questions in English and his answers were often limited to "yes" or "no" [6]. Furthermore, his own witness admitted Chua had never read the Philippine Constitution [6]. When asked about Filipino customs he had embraced, the only custom Chua could cite was the habit of inviting others to eat [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner satisfied the qualifications for naturalization regarding language proficiency and belief in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution [8].

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the lower court [9].

The Court held that the petitioner failed to satisfy the requirements of the Revised Naturalization Law on two grounds. First, regarding the language requirement under Section 7, the Court found Chua's ability to speak and write English insufficient because his proficiency was limited to simple "yes" and "no" answers, and he required an interpreter during the hearing [6]. Second, regarding the requirement of belief in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution, the Court ruled that one cannot claim attachment to principles embodied in a document one has never read [6]. Chua’s witness testified that the petitioner had never read the Constitution, and Chua's own testimony demonstrated a lack of understanding of its principles [7]. Additionally, citing the "habit of inviting others to eat" as the only embraced Filipino custom was deemed insufficient to recommend him for citizenship [7].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED** [9].
