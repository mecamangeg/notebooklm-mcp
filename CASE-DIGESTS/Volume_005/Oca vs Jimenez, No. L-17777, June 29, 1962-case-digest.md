I. CAPTION
MODESTA N. OCA and AMADO OCA v. JUDGE DAMIAN L. JIMENEZ and OSCAR A. INOCENTES, G.R. No. L-17777, June 29, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Modesta and Amado Oca were charged in the Municipal Court of Quezon City under an Information designated by the Special Counsel as "Ill Treatment" [1]. The body of the Information, however, alleged that the accused strangled and pushed Maria Loreto Lintag de Garcia, inflicting physical injuries that did not require medical attendance [2]. After arraignment and entering a plea of not guilty, petitioners filed a Motion to Quash on the ground that the Information charged two offenses: ill-treatment and physical injuries [3]. The Municipal Court denied the motion. Petitioners filed a petition for prohibition and/or certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon City, which dismissed the petition, ruling that the Information charged only one offense of slight physical injuries despite the caption [3]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioners waived their right to move to quash the Information.
2. W/N the designation of the offense in the caption of the Information controls over the recital of facts in the body.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Rule 113, Section 10, an accused who does not move to quash the information before pleading thereto is deemed to have waived all objections which are grounds for such a motion, except when the complaint or information does not charge an offense or the court is without jurisdiction [4]. Since petitioners filed the motion only after their arraignment, the objection was waived [4].

2. **NO.** It is a settled doctrine that the qualification of a crime is not governed by the designation given by the prosecuting attorney in the caption/first part of the information, but by the recital in the body thereof as to the facts alleged to have been committed by the defendant [4]. The technical name of the crime is of no concern to the accused for their defense; what matters are the facts alleged [5]. Here, although designated as "Ill Treatment," the facts alleged clearly described the offense of slight physical injuries under Article 266, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code [4].

The Order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [6].
