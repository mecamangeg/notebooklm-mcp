**I. CAPTION**
JOSE DE LA CRUZ Y DELFIN v. SULPICIO DOLLETE, LOURDES BARCELON, and THE HON. JUDGE RAMON BLANCO, G.R. No. L-17932, May 30, 1962, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondents Sulpicio Dollete and Lourdes Barcelon filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) claiming they were tenants of petitioner Jose de la Cruz and were illegally dismissed. They demanded their share of the produce for the years 1956 to 1958 and reinstatement [1]. De la Cruz claimed a third party, Eliseo Condino, was the lessee and another person was the tenant [2].

The original presiding judge, Judge Dacayo, issued an order on August 3, 1960, directing the re-opening of the case for the reception of additional evidence [3, 4]. However, Judge Dacayo was transferred, and respondent Judge Ramon Blanco took over. On October 4, 1960, without further notice or proceedings, Judge Blanco rendered a decision on the merits, ordering De la Cruz to pay damages and attorney's fees to the respondents [3]. De la Cruz appealed, arguing Judge Blanco could not reverse the prior judge's order to re-open the case [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N a judge may set aside an order to re-open a case issued by a previous judge of the same court.
2. W/N the Supreme Court should disturb the lower court's factual findings regarding the validity of the lease contract.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that Judge Blanco acted within his authority. An order directing the re-opening of a case is not a decision on the merits but an interlocutory order [4]. Being merely interlocutory and not final, such an order may be modified, disregarded, or set aside by the same court which issued it—even if presided over by a different judge—before a judgment on the merits is rendered [4]. The Court cited *Alvaran v. Pingol*, holding that a judge is not prohibited from setting aside an interlocutory order of the same court rendered by a different judge [4, 5].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the findings of the trial court regarding flaws in the evidence of the lease contract (Exhibit "1") could not be disregarded [6]. The lower court found that the respondents had objected to the contract and that there were flaws in the evidence regarding its due execution [6]. Findings of fact by the lower court cannot be reversed on appeal unless there is an absence of substantial evidence to support them [6].

Petition dismissed [7].
