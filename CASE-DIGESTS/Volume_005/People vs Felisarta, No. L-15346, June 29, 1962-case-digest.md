**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROGELIO FELISARTA, G.R. No. L-15346, June 29, 1962, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Rogelio Felisarta was apprehended for driving a rig without a driver's license in Cebu City. He was charged with violating City Ordinance No. 65, series of 1948, which requires rig drivers to pay a one-peso (P1.00) annual license fee [1, 2]. The Municipal Court convicted him and imposed a fine of P5.00 [1]. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Cebu sustained the conviction and increased the fine to P15.00 [2]. Felisarta appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the City of Cebu lacked the power to regulate the occupation of rig drivers because it was not explicitly enumerated in the City Charter (Commonwealth Act No. 58), and that the license fee could not be sustained under the general welfare clause of the Revised Administrative Code [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the City of Cebu has the authority to validly impose a license fee on rig drivers under its police power.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court held that while rig drivers are not explicitly listed in the City Charter's enumeration of occupations subject to licensing, the City has the power to regulate them under the general grant of police power found in Section 2238 of the Administrative Code and Section 17(ee) of the City Charter [4]. Regulating rig drivers involves the use of municipal property and matters of public interest such as sanitation, safety, and general welfare [5].

The Court distinguished three classes of municipal licenses: (1) for regulating useful occupations; (2) for restricting non-useful occupations; and (3) for revenue only [5]. The first two are based on police power, while the third rests on taxing power [5]. The P1.00 fee imposed by Ordinance No. 65 falls under the first class, as it is a minimal amount intended not for revenue, but to defray the necessary expenses of registration and police regulation [6]. Consequently, the ordinance is valid.

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [7].
