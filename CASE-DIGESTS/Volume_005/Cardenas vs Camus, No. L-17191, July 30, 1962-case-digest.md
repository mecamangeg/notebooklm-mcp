**I. CAPTION**
**JOSE PEREZ CARDENAS v. PEDRO CAMUS**, G.R. No. L-17191, July 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
On May 26, 1941, Pedro Camus (defendant-appellant), with Jose Perez Cardenas (plaintiff-appellee) as solidary guarantor, executed a promissory note for P2,000.00 in favor of Jose Garrido [1]. Both failed to pay, leading Garrido to sue them in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. However, Camus could not be served with summons, so the case proceeded only against Cardenas, who was adjudged liable [2]. Cardenas paid the judgment totaling P2,910.00 [3].

Subsequently, in September 1958, the parties agreed that Camus would reimburse Cardenas P3,123.00 in installments. Camus defaulted after three payments, prompting Cardenas to file the present action for collection in the CFI of Rizal [3].

Trial was set for March 22, 1960. On March 18, four days before trial, Camus filed a motion to dismiss (alleging improper venue/lack of jurisdiction and bar by prior judgment) and a motion for continuance. He set the motion to dismiss for hearing on March 26, four days *after* the scheduled trial [4]. On March 18, the trial court denied the continuance. Camus failed to appear at the trial. The court received Cardenas' evidence and rendered judgment ordering Camus to pay P3,048.45 plus attorney's fees [5]. Camus appealed, arguing the court erred in denying the continuance and ignoring his motion to dismiss [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the trial court erred in denying the motion for continuance.
2. W/N the trial court erred in proceeding with trial without first resolving the motion to dismiss.
3. W/N the trial court had jurisdiction over the subject matter.
4. W/N the action was barred by prior judgment due to Cardenas' failure to file a cross-claim in the previous case.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The granting or denial of a motion for continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial court [7, 8]. Camus answered the complaint in January but waited until four days before the March 22 trial to file his motions. By setting the hearing for his motion to dismiss on March 26 (after the trial date), it was obvious the motion for continuance was intended merely to delay the termination of the case [8].

2. **NO.** After properly denying the motion for continuance, the trial court was not under obligation to pass upon a motion to dismiss that the defendant himself had set for hearing on a date subsequent to the scheduled trial [9, 10]. Camus had no right to force a postponement upon the court by setting his motion for hearing at a later date [10].

3. **YES.** (The court had jurisdiction). Jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by the allegations in the complaint, not by the merits of the plaintiff's claim nor by the defenses pleaded by the defendant in his answer or motion to dismiss [11, 12].

4. **NO.** The defense of bar by prior judgment is without merit. In the previous case (Civil Case No. 21439), Camus was not served with summons. Therefore, Cardenas could not have filed a cross-claim against him in that proceeding, as Camus was not properly brought under the court's jurisdiction [13].

**Decision affirmed.** [14]
