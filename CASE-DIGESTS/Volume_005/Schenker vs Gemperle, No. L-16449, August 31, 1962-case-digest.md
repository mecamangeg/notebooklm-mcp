**I. CAPTION**
PAUL SCHENKER v. WILLIAM F. GEMPERLE, G.R. No. L-16449, August 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
In 1953, Paul Schenker and William Gemperle verbally agreed to organize "The Philippine Swiss Trading Co., Inc." and divide the capital stock equally between them. Gemperle confirmed this in a letter but placed 76% of the shares in his name, explaining it was a temporary measure to comply with the Flag Law regarding government contracts. He promised to transfer the shares to Schenker later to equalize their holdings. Schenker paid P7,000 for his subscription. Despite demands, Gemperle refused to transfer the shares. Schenker filed a complaint for specific performance. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that since the agreement did not fix a time for performance, the obligation was not yet due, and a separate action to fix the period was necessary [1], [2], [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the trial court may fix the period for the performance of the obligation in the present action for specific performance, even if the complaint did not explicitly ask for it.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the dismissal. It held that the nature of an action is determined by the essential allegations of fact, not the prayer [4]. The complaint sufficiently alleged ultimate facts to plead the right of action under Article 1197 of the Civil Code (judicial fixing of a period), specifically: (1) facts showing a contract was entered into; and (2) facts showing the performance was left to the will of the obligor or that a period was intended [4].

Furthermore, the general prayer for "such other and further relief as the Court may appear just and equitable" is broad enough to justify fixing the period, even if the plaintiff sought immediate performance [5], [6]. Citing *Barretto v. City of Manila*, the Court ruled that the trial court could determine the time for performance in the same action to avoid multiplicity of suits [6]. The Court also noted that the obligation could be considered pure and demandable at once under Article 1179, as its performance did not depend on an uncertain event [7].

The Order appealed from is reversed and the case is remanded to the court of origin for further and appropriate proceedings [8].
