I. CAPTION
JOSE P. VELEZ and JESUS P. VELEZ v. HON. GUSTAVO VICTORIANO, MIGUEL CUENCO and the COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-18114, June 29, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Miguel Cuenco filed complaints with the City Fiscal of Manila against petitioners Jose and Jesus Velez for violations of the Coal Land Act (perjury) [1]. Petitioners moved to quash the complaints, arguing that the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila lacked jurisdiction because the affidavits involved were prepared, signed, and sworn to in Cebu City [1], [2]. The fiscal denied the motion, noting that while the documents originated in Cebu, they were addressed and submitted to the Director of Mines in Manila [2]. Consequently, informations were filed in CFI Manila presided by Judge Victoriano, who issued warrants of arrest [3]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of Appeals (CA), which was denied on the ground that the offense is transitory [4]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the jurisdiction of the Manila court and the standing of Cuenco to intervene [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N respondent Cuenco has the standing to file the complaint and intervene.
2. W/N the CFI of Manila has jurisdiction over the offense charged despite the affidavits being executed in Cebu.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that Cuenco had the right to denounce the violation. Even assuming he was merely an informer, giving information to the fiscal is not an interference with the fiscal's authority to investigate [6]. Furthermore, Cuenco held a 23% interest in the Bisaya Land Transportation Company, whose funds were allegedly utilized by the petitioners, giving him sufficient interest in the matter [5], [6].

2. **YES.** The CFI of Manila has jurisdiction because the affidavits were presented to the Director of Mines, whose office is in Manila [7]. Relying on the doctrine in *U.S. v. Cañete*, the Court explained that the gist of the offense of perjury or giving false evidence is not the mere making or subscribing of the affidavit, but the "intentional giving of false evidence" by means of such affidavit [7]. Since the affidavits were submitted and used in Manila, the crime was committed within the jurisdiction of the Manila courts [8].

Petition denied [8].
