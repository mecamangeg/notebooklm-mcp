I. CAPTION
CONCEPCION H. LUNA, ET AL. v. MONS. PEDRO P. SANTOS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-10457, May 22, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, the nephews and nieces of the late Fr. Martin Alcazar, filed a petition to annul a deed of sale covering two parcels of land executed by Fr. Alcazar in favor of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Nueva Caceres [1-3]. The petitioners alleged that the sale was not validly effected because the full consideration of P12,000.00 was not paid; only P2,200.00 was paid, while the balance was entrusted to respondent Mons. Pedro P. Santos for a mission house fund [3]. The Court of First Instance of Sorsogon dismissed the petition for annulment but also dismissed the respondents' counterclaims for moral and actual damages, ruling that the petitioners acted in good faith [4-6]. The respondents appealed the dismissal of their counterclaims to the Supreme Court, arguing that the suit caused them discredit and shame [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners are liable for moral damages for filing the action for annulment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court [7]. The Court held that there was no sufficient basis to hold the petitioners liable for moral damages because they filed the petition in the "honest belief" that the transfer was not really effected due to the lack of real consideration [1, 3]. As relatives of the deceased owner, they acted in good faith based on the finding that only a fraction of the purchase price was actually paid [3]. The filing of an action in the honest belief that a sufficient cause of action exists negates the award of moral damages [1, 8]. The decision of the court *a quo* dismissing the counterclaims is affirmed [7].
