I. CAPTION
GAPAN FARMER'S COOPERATIVE MARKETING ASSOCIATION, INC. v. PARIAL, et al., G.R. No. L-17024, July 24, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Fe Parial and Lucy Cabatuando, former employees of the petitioner Association, filed complaints for unpaid wages with Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor on December 11, 1957 [1]. The Hearing Officer rendered decisions ordering the Association to pay the claims [1]. When the Regional Administrator issued a writ of execution, the Association filed a petition for *certiorari* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Nueva Ecija to restrain the enforcement [2]. The Association argued that the decisions and writ were void because Section 25 of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, which granted the Regional Office jurisdiction, was unconstitutional [2]. The CFI ruled in favor of the Association, declaring the Regional Office's acts null and void [2, 3]. The respondents appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is valid insofar as it grants Regional Offices of the Department of Labor the authority to hear money claims and issue writs of execution.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that Republic Act No. 997, the enabling law for Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, contemplated a reorganization merely of the executive branch of the Government [4]. By vesting Regional Offices of the Department of Labor with the authority to hear money claims and render decisions thereon, as well as authorizing the issuance of writs of execution, the Plan sought to clothe said offices with judicial power belonging to and possessed by courts of justice [4]. This exceeded the authority conferred upon the Government Survey and Reorganization Commission and violated the principle of separation of powers by conferring judicial powers upon an agency of the executive branch [4]. Citing *Corominas vs. Labor Standards Commission*, the Court affirmed the decision of the lower court [4, 5].
