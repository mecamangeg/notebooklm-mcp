I. CAPTION
MO YUEN TSI v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17137, June 29, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Mo Yuen Tsi filed a petition for naturalization, which the Court of First Instance of Manila granted [1]. The Republic appealed, contending that the petitioner failed to prove his character witnesses, David de Guzman and Ceferino Simpao, were "credible persons" as required by law [2], [3]. The Solicitor General argued that Simpao was incompetent because he only met the petitioner casually in a restaurant in 1947 and could not even remember the name of the friend who introduced them [4], [5]. Furthermore, Simpao's knowledge of the petitioner's attachment to the principles of the Philippine Constitution was baseless [6]. Regarding de Guzman, the Republic noted his testimony was evasive and non-responsive [4]. The Republic asserted that because of the limited association between the witnesses and the petitioner, they were not competent to vouch that the petitioner was "morally irreproachable" [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the character witnesses presented are "credible persons" within the meaning of the Revised Naturalization Law.
2. W/N the petitioner satisfied the statutory requirement of being "morally irreproachable."

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that a "credible person" under the Revised Naturalization Law is not merely an individual without a criminal record, but one who has good standing in the community, is reputed to be trustworthy, and whose word may be taken at face value as a warranty of the petitioner's trustworthiness [8], [3]. In this case, the witnesses failed to meet this standard. Witness Simpao's inability to recall the details of his introduction to the petitioner and his lack of basis for stating the petitioner believed in Constitutional principles cast serious doubt on his credibility and competence [4], [6]. Witness de Guzman's evasive answers similarly eroded his credibility [4]. The Court applied the ruling in *Ong v. Republic*, stating it is incumbent upon the petitioner to affirmatively establish that his witnesses are credible [3].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the phrase "morally irreproachable" is not satisfied by mere "good conduct"; the law requires a moral character of the highest order [9], [7]. Vouching witnesses must prove this qualification at trial, not just in affidavits [10], [11]. Because the witnesses in this case had only a casual association with the petitioner, they were not competent to testify on his moral character and behavior during his entire period of residence in the Philippines [12], [7]. Strict compliance with the law is required for naturalization [13].

The decision appealed from was **REVERSED** and the petition was **DENIED** [14].
