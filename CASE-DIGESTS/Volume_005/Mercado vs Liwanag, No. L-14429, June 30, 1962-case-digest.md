I. CAPTION
RAMON MERCADO and BASILIA MERCADO joined by her husband, FRANCISCO RONQUILLO v. PIO D. LIWANAG, G.R. No. L-14429, June 30, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Ramon and Basilia Mercado were registered co-owners *pro-indiviso* of a parcel of land covered by T.C.T. No. 20805 [1]. Ramon Mercado sold his rights and interests to respondent Pio D. Liwanag via a Deed of Sale, which described a specific concrete portion of the land (one-half, defined by metes and bounds) rather than an aliquot share [2]. This sale was made without the consent of the other co-owner, Basilia [1]. Upon registration, the Register of Deeds cancelled the old title and issued T.C.T. No. 32757 in the names of Liwanag and Basilia as "co-owners pro-indiviso," effectively converting the specific sale into a sale of an undivided share [3], [4]. The Mercados filed a complaint to annul the Deed of Sale, arguing it was invalid under Article 493 of the Civil Code for conveying a specific portion of common property [5]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint [5], [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the sale by a co-owner of a specific portion of the co-owned property invalidates the transaction.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the sale is valid but is legally limited to the co-owner's undivided aliquot share. Under **Article 493 of the Civil Code**, a co-owner has full ownership of his part and may alienate it, but the effect of the alienation is limited to the portion which may be allotted to him upon the termination of the co-ownership [7], [6]. Consequently, a co-owner cannot validly convey a specific portion by metes and bounds before partition [7]. However, the Court held that the validity of the sale must be considered in conjunction with the title issued pursuant to it [8], [6]. Since the new title (T.C.T. No. 32757) correctly registered Liwanag as a co-owner of an *undivided* one-half share—which Ramon had the absolute right to dispose of—the transaction was valid and Basilia's rights as a co-owner remained intact [4], [6]. The decision appealed from was **AFFIRMED** [9].
