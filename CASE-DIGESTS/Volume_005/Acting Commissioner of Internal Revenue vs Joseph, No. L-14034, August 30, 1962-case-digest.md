I. CAPTION
THE ACTING COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. LAZARUS JOSEPH, ALBERT JOSEPH, GEORGE JOSEPH and JOHN JOSEPH, G.R. No. L-14034, August 30, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In August 1947, respondents (the Josephs) received income tax deficiency assessments for the years 1945 and 1946. They requested a reinvestigation. In October 1951, the Commissioner reiterated the assessments and issued warrants of distraint and levy. To suspend the summary proceedings, respondents represented that they were solvent and owned shares in Joseph Bros., Inc., which the Commissioner then garnished. Following a second reinvestigation requested in 1953, the Commissioner insisted on the assessments in August 1955 and requested the transfer of the garnished shares to satisfy the P294,498.03 liability.

In December 1955, respondents protested, questioning for the first time the government's power to collect by distraint and levy, arguing it had prescribed. On January 13, 1956, the Commissioner issued a letter overruling the protest and stating the right to collect had not prescribed. Respondents received this ruling before March 3, 1956. On May 5, 1956, respondents filed a petition for injunction with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) to restrain the sale of the shares. The CTA eventually ruled in favor of respondents, declaring the sale void and stating no deficiency tax was due. The Commissioner appealed, arguing the petition to the CTA was filed beyond the reglementary period [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Tax Appeals had jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed by respondents.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the 30-day period fixed in Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125 for questioning a ruling of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is jurisdictional. The "ruling" being questioned was the Commissioner's letter of January 13, 1956, which maintained that the government's right to collect had not prescribed. Respondents received this letter before March 3, 1956, but did not file their petition until May 5, 1956—well beyond the 30-day period [6], [7].

The Court rejected the CTA's view that the period should be counted from the notice of sale at public auction. The Court reasoned that to uphold such a contention would be equivalent to stating that in ordinary civil cases, the period to appeal begins only when the sheriff advertises properties for sale on execution, rather than from the adverse decision itself. Since the petition was filed out of time, the CTA had no jurisdiction to entertain it or declare the distraint proceedings invalid. The decision is revoked, and the petitions are dismissed [8], [9].
