**I. CAPTION**
ILOILO DOCK & ENGINEERING CO. v. THE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and FLORENTINO VISITACION, G.R. No. L-16202, June 29, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Salvador Visitacion was a clerk for petitioner Iloilo Dock & Engineering Co. (IDECO) and the president of a labor union within the company. On June 23, 1958, at about 2:15 PM, Visitacion left his office but remained within the company compound. There, he was shot and killed by Cerson Espinosa, a non-employee and leader of a rival union. The incident occurred while a petition for certification election was pending to determine the bargaining representative for IDECO employees.

The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded death benefits to Visitacion's heir, finding that the assault occurred during work hours and within the employer's premises, thus arising "in the course" of employment [1]. IDECO appealed, arguing that the death was caused by personal rivalry between labor leaders and was not work-connected [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the death of the employee is compensable under the Workmen's Compensation Act even in the absence of specific evidence showing a work-connected cause.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the WCC's decision. The Court held that the absence of specific evidence regarding a work-connected cause of the assault is not fatal to a claim for compensation if the death occurred in the course of employment [3].

Applying the doctrine in *Batangas Transportation Co. v. Vda. de Rivera* (G.R. No. L-7658), the Court ruled that where death occurs within the time and space limits of employment, a presumption arises that it "arose out of" said employment [4, 5]. In this case, Visitacion died during work hours within the company compound. Furthermore, the petitioner's claim that the killing was due to personal rivalry was found to be groundless, as no evidence of personal enmity was presented [6].

Decision affirmed [5].
