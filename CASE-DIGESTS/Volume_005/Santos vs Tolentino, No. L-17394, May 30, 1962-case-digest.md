I. CAPTION
AMADOR D. SANTOS v. DOLORES BANZON TOLENTINO and EULOGIO C. TOLENTINO, G.R. No. L-17394, May 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Amador D. Santos owned "Santos Taxi." On June 14, 1951, his driver, Vicente Duldulao, negligently reversed a taxi and ran over respondent Dolores Banzon Tolentino, causing her serious physical injuries [1]. Duldulao pleaded guilty to serious physical injuries through reckless negligence and was sentenced to imprisonment [1]. Having reserved their right to a separate civil action, Dolores and her husband filed a suit for damages against Santos and Duldulao [2]. The Court of First Instance ordered them to pay jointly and severally actual and moral damages [2]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the award but modified Santos's liability to be merely subsidiary to Duldulao's, pursuant to Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) [2]. Santos appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing he should not be liable for moral damages as an employer [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an employer is subsidiarily liable for moral damages in an action based on a crime committed by his employee.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the liability for moral damages. The Court relied on established jurisprudence (*San Jose v. Del Mundo*, *Lilius v. Manila Railroad Co.*, and *Castro v. Acro Taxicab Co.*) which permits the recovery of moral damages in such cases [3]. The Court distinguished this action, which arises from a crime (*ex delicto*) governed by Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code, from the cases cited by the petitioner (*e.g., Fores v. Miranda*), which involved breach of contract [4]. While limitations on recovery may exist in actions for breach of contract (*ex contractu*), these do not apply to actions based on crimes or quasi-delicts where the employer's subsidiary liability includes moral damages [4, 5].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [6].
