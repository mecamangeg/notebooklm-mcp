**I. CAPTION**
SI NE @ SI ANLOK v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16828, May 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Si Ne (alias Si Anlok), a Chinese citizen, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Manila. He claimed to have resided in the Philippines for at least 10 years prior to the petition. He had several children, three of whom (born in 1931, 1937, and 1941) remained in China and were not enrolled in Philippine schools during the required residence period [1, 2]. To support his petition, he presented two character witnesses: Remedios Gasel Vda. de Castelo, a bookkeeper for his cousin (whose husband was also petitioner’s lawyer), and Servando P. Patawaran, a co-employee at the business where petitioner worked [3]. The trial court granted the petition. The Republic appealed, arguing, among other grounds, that the petitioner failed to meet the educational requirement for his children and that his witnesses were not credible [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petitioner complied with the educational requirement regarding his children.
2. W/N the character witnesses presented satisfied the legal requirement of credibility.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner failed to comply with the educational requirement. Under the Revised Naturalization Law, an applicant must enroll his minor children of school age in recognized Philippine schools during the entire period of residence required of him [2]. The record showed that three of his children (Si Meng, Si Leng, and Si Lee) were of school age during the 10-year period but remained in China [2]. The fact that they were in China did not excuse him from complying with the law, as it was his duty to make every effort to bring them to the Philippines for the requisite education (*Dy Chuan Tiao v. Republic*; *Tan Hoi v. Republic*) [2].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the witnesses were not "credible persons" within the purview of the law. A credible witness must not only give credible testimony but must also be a person of good standing, honest, upright, and reputed to be trustworthy, effectively acting as an "insurer of the character" of the applicant (*Alfredo Ong v. Republic*) [5]. In this case, the witnesses—an employee of the petitioner’s cousin and a co-employee—were bound to the petitioner by professional or business ties. These relationships rendered them partial and insufficient to meet the requirement that affiants be credible persons [3].

**Decision reversed.**
