I. CAPTION
PLYWOOD INDUSTRIES, INC. v. THE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and ARSENIO MANAOAT, G.R. No. L-18165, May 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Arsenio Manaoat was employed by Plywood Industries, Inc. in 1954 as a splicer-operator after passing a pre-employment medical exam. His workplace was hot and dusty, as the exhaust system could not eliminate all the dust. In 1957, while employed, he suffered chest pains and coughing. The company physician treated him, and he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Manaoat stopped working, and the company paid him 60% of his wages and P70.00 in compensation. He returned to his hometown in Lingayen, Pangasinan, where subsequent check-ups revealed active tuberculosis. The Labor Regional Office No. 1 awarded him compensation, which the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed *en banc*. The petitioner appealed, questioning the compensability of the illness, the timeliness of the notice of injury, and the venue of the action [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claimant's illness is compensable.
2. W/N the claim is barred by the late filing of the notice of injury.
3. W/N the Labor Regional Office No. 1 had jurisdiction to hear the case.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The WCC's findings are supported by substantial evidence and the petitioner's own admissions. In W.C.C. Forms Nos. 3 and 4, the company and its physician expressly admitted that the claimant was suffering from "Kock's pulmonary, minimal, right" and that the cause of the illness was "occupational" [3, 5].

2. **NO.** Section 26 of Act 3428 (Workmen's Compensation Act) dispenses with the requirement of a timely notice of injury when the employer has furnished medical services or made voluntary compensation payments. In this case, the company physician treated the claimant for tuberculosis, and the employer admitted to voluntarily paying P70.00 as compensation [4, 6, 7].

3. **YES.** The petitioner's argument regarding the hearing location refers to venue, not jurisdiction. Under the WCC Rules, venue is proper where the claimant resides. Since Manaoat is a resident of Lingayen, Pangasinan, the case was properly heard in Regional Office No. 1 [8].

Petition denied [9, 10].
