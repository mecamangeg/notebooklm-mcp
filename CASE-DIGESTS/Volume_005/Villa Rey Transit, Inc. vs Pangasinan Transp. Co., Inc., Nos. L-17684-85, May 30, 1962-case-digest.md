I. CAPTION
VILLA REY TRANSIT, INC. v. PANGASINAN TRANSPORTATION COMPANY, INC., ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-17684-85, May 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On April 7, 1959, petitioner Villa Rey Transit, Inc. purchased five certificates of public convenience (CPCs) from Valentin A. Fernando. The Public Service Commission (PSC) provisionally approved the sale and authorized Villa Rey to operate, subject to the condition that it register the buses in its name within 45 days. Villa Rey immediately began operations and, after obtaining an extension, registered the buses within the prescribed period.

However, on July 22, 1959, the PSC issued an order in another case provisionally approving the sale of two of the same CPCs to respondent Pangasinan Transportation Co., Inc. (Pantranco). Pantranco acquired these rights from Eusebio E. Ferrer, who had purchased them at a Sheriff's auction on July 16, 1959, following a levy on execution against Valentin A. Fernando. The PSC subsequently rendered a decision recognizing Pantranco as the lawful owner and cancelling Villa Rey's authority, erroneously finding that Villa Rey failed to register its buses and abandoned service. The PSC records regarding Villa Rey's extension and compliance had been misplaced. Villa Rey filed a petition for review.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner Villa Rey Transit, Inc. has a better right to the certificates of public convenience than respondent Pantranco.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Public Service Commission. The Court held that the petitioner purchased the certificates in good faith and for valuable consideration on April 7, 1959, which was "much ahead in point of time" than the levy and auction sale involving the respondents in July 1959 [1, 2].

The Court corrected the PSC's finding regarding the registration of buses, noting it was based on a "misapprehension" because the records of the extension granted to Villa Rey were misplaced [3]. The petitioner validly registered the buses within the extended period and was not prohibited from operating pending such registration [4].

Furthermore, the Court ruled that Pantranco's status as an older operator with extensive lines did not entitle it to preference. To hold otherwise would be "conducive to monopoly and is contrary to the principle that promotes a healthy competition" [1].

Decision reversed. The PSC order is set aside, and the Commission is directed to allow petitioner to continue operating the lines provisionally until the question of ownership is determined by the proper regular courts [5].
