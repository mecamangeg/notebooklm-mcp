I. CAPTION
DALMACIO PREPOTENTE v. HON. JOSE SURTIDA, PRIMO ALCID, and VICENTE MANALO, G.R. No. L-18420, May 24, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Prepotente filed a complaint for recovery of overtime pay and damages against respondents Alcid and Manalo in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Sur [1]. The CFI dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction [2]. Prepotente received the notice of decision on October 23, 1960 [2]. Four days later, on October 27, 1960, he filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied [2]. He received the denial on February 15, 1961 [2].

On February 28, 1961, Prepotente filed a Notice of Appeal and a motion to extend the period to file the record on appeal, setting the hearing for March 14, 1961 [2]. However, on March 10, 1961, he filed his Record on Appeal and Appeal Bond [2]. The CFI denied the appeal, ruling that the motion for extension was set for hearing on a date (March 14) when the 30-day reglementary period had already expired [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal was perfected within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the appeal was perfected on time [4]. Under Sec. 3, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, to perfect an appeal, the appellant must serve and file the notice of appeal, appeal bond, and record on appeal within 30 days from notice of judgment, deducting the time during which a motion to set aside has been pending [4].

Deducting the 4 days consumed before filing the motion for reconsideration, the petitioner had 26 days remaining from the receipt of the denial on February 15, 1961, giving him until March 13, 1961 to perfect the appeal [4]. Since the Record on Appeal and Appeal Bond were filed on March 10, 1961, the requirements were met within the statutory period [4]. The motion for extension became unnecessary, and the fact that its hearing was set for March 14 was of no moment [5].

The orders denying the appeal were set aside, and the lower court was instructed to give due course to the appeal [6].
