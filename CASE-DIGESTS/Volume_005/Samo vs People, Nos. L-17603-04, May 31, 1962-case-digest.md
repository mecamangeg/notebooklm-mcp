I. CAPTION
CEFERINA SAMO v. THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-17603-04, May 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ceferina Samo, an importer, opened two letters of credit with the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) in 1954 to import squids and sardines. She paid a 30% marginal deposit, and the Bank advanced the balance to release the goods [1]. Upon arrival, Samo executed two trust receipts in favor of BPI, acknowledging receipt of the goods in trust and agreeing to sell them for the Bank's account. She was obligated to remit the proceeds or return the goods if unsold by July 31, 1954 [2].

Despite repeated demands, Samo failed to account for the goods or the proceeds [3]. Consequently, she was charged with two counts of Estafa in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. Samo argued that because she contributed 30% of the cost, the transaction was merely a loan, and the trust receipts were mere formalities, giving rise only to civil liability [4]. The CFI convicted her, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction [4, 5]. After the cases were filed, Samo made partial payments to the Bank [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the violation of the terms of the trust receipts constitutes Estafa.
2. W/N the partial payments made by the petitioner extinguish her criminal liability.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The violation constitutes Estafa. The Supreme Court rejected the defense that the transaction was a simple loan. A trust receipt is a security transaction intended to aid importers who lack funds to finance importations [6]. Citing *Philippine National Bank vs. Vda. ê Hijos de Angel Jose*, the Court held that trust receipts partake of the nature of a conditional sale where ownership remains with the bank until full payment [7]. The failure of the petitioner to turn over the proceeds of the sale or return the goods covered by the trust receipts constitutes the crime of Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1-(b) of the Revised Penal Code [8].

2. **NO.** The Court held that payment does not extinguish criminal liability for Estafa. The fact that the petitioner made partial payments to the Bank subsequent to the filing of the criminal cases does not alter the situation [9].

The petition is **DISMISSED**, and the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [10].
