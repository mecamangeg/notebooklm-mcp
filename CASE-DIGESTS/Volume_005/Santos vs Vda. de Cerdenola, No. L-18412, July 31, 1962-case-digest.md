I. CAPTION
JOSE SANTOS v. CECILIA LOPEZ VDA. DE CERDENOLA and HON. JUDGE PASTOR DE GUZMAN, G.R. No. L-18412, July 31, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Cecilia Lopez Vda. de Cerdenola and her late husband were tenants of a landholding in Hacienda Esperanza, Pangasinan, since 1922. After her husband died in November 1952, Cecilia continued cultivating the land for six years with the knowledge and permission of the hacienda's overseer, Andres Cion, sharing the harvest on a 45-55 basis. In 1958, petitioner Jose Santos, the new administrator, ejected Cecilia and replaced her with another tenant, claiming her tenancy terminated upon her husband's death. Cecilia filed a case for reinstatement and damages with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR).

The CAR rendered a partial decision in 1960 ordering her reinstatement and a final order in March 1961 determining damages. Instead of appealing or filing a Motion for Reconsideration with the CAR, Santos filed a special civil action for certiorari with the Supreme Court on May 9, 1961, alleging the CAR acted without jurisdiction.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the special civil action for certiorari is proper.
2. W/N an implied tenancy relationship existed between the petitioner and respondent after the death of the latter's husband.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the failure to ask for a reconsideration of a decision or order of the court, as required by Section 1, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, is fatal and is a ground for dismissal [1, 2]. Furthermore, the proper remedy was an appeal. The CAR's partial decision and final order became final and executory due to the petitioner's own fault in not appealing within the prescribed period [3-5]. Certiorari will not lie as a substitute for a lost appeal [5].

2. **YES.** While the original tenancy might have technically ended upon the husband's death in 1952, a new tenancy relationship was established. Under Section 7 of Republic Act 1199, tenancy relationships may be established expressly or impliedly [5]. The fact that Cecilia was allowed to cultivate the land for six years (1952–1958) by the landholder's overseer created an implied contract of tenancy [2, 5]. Consequently, she was entitled to security of tenure, and her ejectment was unlawful.

The petition is dismissed, and the preliminary injunction is dissolved.
