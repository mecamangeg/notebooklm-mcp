I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FR. FAUSTINO BALANCIO and ROSARIO QUERUBIN, G.R. No. L-17520, May 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Fr. Faustino Balancio's convent in Caoayan, Ilocos Sur, had been frequently stoned at night. On the evening of December 30, 1958, during another stoning incident, appellant Rosario Querubin, who was at the convent, went outside to chase the culprits. He encountered Serafin Querubin, a policeman who was approaching to investigate the disturbance. Rosario shot and killed Serafin. Rosario claimed self-defense, alleging Serafin tried to draw his gun first. However, evidence showed Serafin’s gun was still tucked in his pocket.

The prosecution claimed Fr. Balancio was a principal by inducement, relying on testimony from the deceased’s relatives that the priest shouted, "Remember the promise, even a policeman, shoot him" or "Even a policeman, you fire at him, I will be responsible later on." The Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur convicted both appellants of murder and sentenced them to life imprisonment.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Fr. Balancio is criminally liable as a principal by inducement.
2. W/N Rosario Querubin acted in self-defense.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that mere utterances such as "even a policeman, shoot him" made prior to a shooting are not legally sufficient to sustain a conviction for murder by inducement in the absence of other incriminating evidence. Citing *People v. Omine* and *People v. Tamayo*, the Court ruled that for inducement to exist, it must appear that the inducement was the determining cause of the commission of the crime. Additionally, the witnesses testifying to the inducement were relatives of the deceased with prior animosity toward the priest, making their testimony biased. Consequently, Fr. Balancio was **ACQUITTED**.

2. **NO.** Rosario Querubin’s claim of self-defense was rejected because physical evidence proved the victim's gun was still tucked inside his hip pocket, negating the claim that the victim attempted to draw his weapon. However, the Court modified the conviction from murder to **HOMICIDE**, finding no aggravating or mitigating circumstances. Rosario Querubin was sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 6 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 14 years, 8 months and 1 day of *reclusion temporal*.
