I. CAPTION
ALFONSO ZOBEL, G. H. W. CHURCHILL and J. ANTONIO ARANETA v. HERMOGENES CONCEPCION, JR. and ANTONIO G. ALINDOGAN, G.R. No. L-17806, June 29, 1962, Labrador, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On December 29, 1959, Gavino S. Abaya demanded additional payment from petitioner Alfonso Zobel regarding a land sale to Ayala Securities Corporation. When Zobel refused, Abaya charged petitioner J. Antonio Araneta and Ayala Securities with violating the Anti-Dummy Law (Commonwealth Act No. 108) before the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) [3]. The NBI endorsed the charge to the Anti-Dummy Board, which commenced an investigation. While the case was pending before the Board, Abaya filed the same charge with the respondent City Fiscal of Manila [4].

Respondent Assistant Fiscal Antonio G. Alindogan subpoenaed petitioners for investigation. Petitioners filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the City Fiscal lacked authority to investigate Anti-Dummy Law violations independently of the Anti-Dummy Board [4]. The Fiscal denied the motion. Petitioners filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, but the trial court dismissed the petition, ruling that the Fiscal had the power to investigate [2, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the City Fiscal of Manila has the authority to investigate and prosecute violations of the Anti-Dummy Law independently of the Anti-Dummy Board. [5]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the City Fiscal cannot prosecute violations of the Anti-Dummy Law independently of and without coordination with the Anti-Dummy Board. Republic Act No. 1130 created the Board to ensure the implementation of nationalization laws and to coordinate all government agencies charged with their enforcement [6]. Specifically, Section 6 of R.A. 1130 authorizes the President to detail assistant provincial fiscals to the Board on special duty [7].

The Court reasoned that if City Fiscals were allowed to act independently, Section 6 would be superfluous, and there would be "no order, concert, cooperation, and coordination" between the Board and the fiscals as envisioned by the law [8]. To achieve the coordination mandated by R.A. 1130, the Anti-Dummy Board must be given the power to direct and control the prosecution of Anti-Dummy Law violations [8].

The appeal was found meritorious. The orders of the lower court were set aside, and the writ of prohibition was issued against the respondents [9].
