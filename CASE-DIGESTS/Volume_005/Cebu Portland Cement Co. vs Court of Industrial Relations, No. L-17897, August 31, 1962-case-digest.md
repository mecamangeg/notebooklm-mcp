I. CAPTION
CEBU PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and PHILIPPINE LAND-AIR-SEA LABOR UNION (PLASLU), G.R. No. L-17897, August 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Dr. Silverio Ceniza was appointed as a part-time dentist for petitioner Cebu Portland Cement Company (CEPOC) in July 1953. On November 13, 1954, he was separated from the service after his position was abolished in the company's budget for fiscal year 1954-1955, allegedly for reasons of economy [1, 2].

On March 30, 1956—one year and four months after his separation—respondent Union (PLASLU) filed a motion with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) praying for Ceniza's reinstatement with back pay [3, 4]. The CIR ruled in favor of Ceniza, ordering his reinstatement on the ground that the abolition of his position was not purely for economy given the company's substantial profits, and that his separation violated civil service rules [5, 6]. CEPOC appealed, contending that Ceniza had abandoned his right to the position due to the delay in filing the action [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Dr. Ceniza’s action for reinstatement is barred by laches.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that Dr. Ceniza is deemed to have lost his right to the position through abandonment.

The Court reiterated the doctrine laid down in *Gutierrez vs. The Bachrach Motor Co., Inc.*, which established that a government official or employee, even those protected by Civil Service Law, must file a petition for reinstatement within one year from the date of dismissal [4]. Failure to do so bars the action due to laches [4].

The rationale is that management must be allowed to conduct its business without the indefinite uncertainty arising from potential reinstatement actions; within a reasonable time of one year, the position may be filled or left vacant, but uncertainty cannot persist indefinitely [7]. Since Dr. Ceniza delayed filing his petition for one year and four months without offering any valid explanation, his claim is barred regardless of the merits of his separation [8].

The order of the Court of Industrial Relations is **REVERSED** insofar as Dr. Ceniza is concerned, and his petition for reinstatement is **DISMISSED**.
