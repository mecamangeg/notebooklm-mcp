I. CAPTION
LEONOR C. TAGAYUMA v. HON. OLEGARIO LASTRILLA, THE PROVINCIAL FISCAL OF SAMAR, and MAXIMO MANOOK, G.R. No. L-17801, August 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On November 16, 1957, the Assistant Provincial Fiscal of Samar filed an Information with the Court of First Instance (CFI) charging petitioner Leonor Tagayuma with violations of the Revised Election Code [1]. The Fiscal certified that he had conducted the preliminary investigation [1]. Respondent Judge Olegario Lastrilla issued a warrant of arrest, and Tagayuma posted bail [2].

On March 10, 1960, Tagayuma filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that under Section 187 of the Revised Election Code, the Fiscal lacked the authority to conduct the preliminary investigation, as such power is exclusively vested in the CFI [2]. The Fiscal opposed, citing his general authority under Republic Act No. 732 [3]. The trial court denied the motion, ruling that the defect was merely procedural and did not affect the court's jurisdiction or the accused's substantial rights [4]. Tagayuma filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Provincial Fiscal has the authority to conduct preliminary investigations for violations of the Revised Election Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that while Provincial Fiscals are authorized to conduct preliminary investigations under the general law (R.A. No. 732), Section 187 of the Revised Election Code acts as a limitation on this power [6]. Section 187 explicitly grants the Courts of First Instance "exclusive original jurisdiction to make preliminary investigations" for violations of the Code [7].

The rationale for this exclusive jurisdiction is that public interest demands immediate investigation and prosecution of election offenses to curb fraud and terrorism. An investigation by the Judge ensures speedy action (removing one stage of the process) and insulates the proceedings from partisan politics [8]. The respondent Judge failed to personally conduct the investigation and take the testimony of the complainant and witnesses under oath as required [9, 10]. This failure is not merely a procedural error but a violation of the accused's substantial right to due process [11].

The orders complained of were set aside, and the case was remanded to the court of origin for preliminary investigation [12].
