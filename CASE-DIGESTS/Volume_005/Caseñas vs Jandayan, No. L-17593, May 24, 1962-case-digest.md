I. CAPTION
INES SAPONG CASEÑAS and AGUSTIN O. CASEÑAS v. RICARDO JANDAYAN, G.R. No. L-17593, May 24, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Ines and Agustin Caseñas were in possession of Lot No. 412 in Butuan. In June 1959, defendant Jandayan allegedly entered a portion of the land through force, threat, intimidation, strategy, and stealth, building a house thereon [1, 2]. Later, before a Bureau of Lands investigation, the defendant allegedly entered another two hectares of the same property, plowing it and gathering coconuts [3]. Plaintiffs filed a complaint for injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan to restrain these acts [4]. The defendant moved to dismiss, arguing the cause of action was barred by a pending suit and lack of jurisdiction [4]. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that since the alleged dispossession occurred within one year, the proper remedy was an action for forcible entry in the inferior court, not an independent injunction in the CFI [5]. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing they were entitled to a preliminary injunction to stop new incursions [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs' proper remedy is an independent action for injunction in the CFI rather than an action for forcible entry in the inferior court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the plaintiffs' remedy is clearly an action for Forcible Entry and Detainer under Rule 72 of the Rules of Court [7].

The Court explained that where the complaint alleges entry by force, threat, intimidation, stealth, and strategy within the one-year period, and that the defendant *continues* to occupy or usurp possession, the case falls under the jurisdiction of the inferior courts [8, 9]. Regarding the "continuing" acts of usurpation or threats of new incursions, the Court ruled that these need not be the subject of a separate action. Instead, the plaintiff may remedy these by securing a writ of preliminary injunction *within* the same forcible entry action under Section 3 of Rule 72, which allows the court to "prevent the defendant from committing further acts of dispossession against plaintiff" [7].

Furthermore, since the plaintiffs had already filed a pending action for forcible entry against the defendant in the municipal court, they were barred from filing this separate action for injunction based on the principle against multiplicity of suits [10, 11].

The order dismissing the complaint was affirmed [12].
