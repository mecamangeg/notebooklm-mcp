I. CAPTION
WILLIAM C. PFLEIDER v. C. N. HODGES, G.R. No. L-17683, July 31, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
In 1941, Petitioner Pfleider borrowed P10,000 from Respondent Hodges. To hide the usurious nature of the loan (as Hodges was then serving a sentence for usury), the parties executed a simulated sale of Pfleider's land and machinery, followed by a simulated lease back to Pfleider [1]. In 1954, Hodges filed Civil Case No. 2860 to recover possession of the properties and collect rentals [1, 2]. To settle the case, Hodges executed a "Contract to Sell" on February 23, 1954, agreeing to sell the properties back to Pfleider on installment [1, 3]. In exchange, Pfleider withdrew his answer in Civil Case No. 2860 and confessed judgment, leading to a decision ordering him to surrender possession [2, 3].

In 1958, Pfleider filed the present action seeking to declare the 1941 transaction an equitable mortgage or, alternatively, to compel Hodges to renew/enforce the 1954 Contract to Sell [4, 5]. Hodges moved to dismiss on the ground of *res judicata*, arguing the matter was settled by the judgment in Civil Case No. 2860 [2]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, ruling that the prior judgment barred the action [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action to enforce the 1954 Contract to Sell is barred by the prior judgment in Civil Case No. 2860 (*res judicata*).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the action is not barred. The original sale and lease upon which Civil Case No. 2860 was based were superseded by the Contract to Sell executed by Hodges on February 23, 1954 [6, 7]. Even assuming the cause of action regarding the 1941 simulated sale is barred by the prior judgment, the alternative cause of action to enforce the 1954 Contract to Sell is not [7]. This constitutes a new cause of action that arose specifically as the consideration for Pfleider's confession of judgment in the previous case [6, 7].

The orders of dismissal and denial of relief were set aside, and the case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [8].
