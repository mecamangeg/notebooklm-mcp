I. CAPTION
CECILIO PE, ET AL. v. ALFONSO PE, G.R. No. L-17396, May 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
The plaintiffs are the parents and siblings of Lolita Pe, who was 24 years old and unmarried at the time of the incident [1]. The defendant, Alfonso Pe, was a married man, a Chinese national, and an adopted son of a collateral relative of Lolita’s father [1, 2]. Because of this relationship, Alfonso was treated like family and allowed free access to their home in Gasan, Marinduque [1]. Starting in 1952, Alfonso frequented the house on the pretext of asking Lolita to teach him to pray the rosary [1, 2]. They eventually fell in love and conducted clandestine trysts [1]. When the family discovered the affair, they forbade Alfonso from the house and even filed deportation proceedings against him [2, 3]. Nevertheless, the affair continued until Lolita disappeared from the parental home on April 14, 1957 [1, 3].

The plaintiffs filed a complaint for damages based on Article 21 of the New Civil Code [4]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, ruling that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the defendant, being aware of his marital status, deliberately and in bad faith tried to win Lolita's affection [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendant is liable for damages under Article 21 of the New Civil Code for carrying on an illicit affair with an unmarried woman.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the defendant won Lolita's affection through an "ingenious scheme or trickery," specifically by frequenting her house under the pretext of learning to pray the rosary and taking advantage of his closeness to the family as a relative [2, 3]. The fact that he is a married man constitutes a wrong that caused immeasurable injury to Lolita and her family [7]. The Court declared that the defendant committed an injury to Lolita's family in a manner contrary to morals, good customs, and public policy as contemplated in Article 21 of the New Civil Code [2, 7].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the defendant is sentenced to pay the plaintiffs P5,000.00 as damages and P2,000.00 as attorney's fees and litigation expenses [7].
