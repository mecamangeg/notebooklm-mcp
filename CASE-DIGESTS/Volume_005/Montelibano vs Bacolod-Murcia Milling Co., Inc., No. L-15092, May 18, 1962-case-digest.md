I. CAPTION
ALFREDO MONTELIBANO, ET AL. v. BACOLOD-MURCIA MILLING CO., INC., G.R. No. L-15092, May 18, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants Montelibano, et al. were sugar planters adhered to defendant-appellee Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co. under 1919 milling contracts set to expire in the 1950s. In 1936, the Central proposed amending the contracts to increase the planters' share from 55% to 60% and extend the contract term to 45 years [1, 2]. To induce the planters to agree, the Central’s Board of Directors passed a Resolution on August 20, 1936, promising that if other sugar centrals in Negros Occidental (producing over 1/3 of the total) granted better terms, the defendant would match them (Paragraph 9) [2, 3].

The plaintiffs signed the printed Amended Milling Contract on September 10, 1936. A copy of the August 20 Resolution was attached to the printed contract later on April 17, 1937 [4]. In 1953, plaintiffs sued to compel the Central to increase their share to 62.33%+, alleging that three other major centrals had already granted such increases [4, 5]. The defendant resisted, arguing the August 20 Resolution was null and void ab initio for being a gratuitous donation without consideration and ultra vires [5]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, upholding the defendant’s stand [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Board Resolution of August 20, 1936 forms part of the milling contract supported by consideration.
2. W/N the Board Resolution is ultra vires and void.

IV. RULING
**1. YES.** The August 20 Resolution was an integral part of the Amended Milling Contract. It was passed 21 days before the plaintiffs signed the printed contract on September 10, 1936 [6]. The resolution served as an inducement for the planters to agree to the extension of the contract period for an additional 15 years [7]. As the resolution modified the pending proposal before acceptance, the "meeting of the minds" on September 10 included the terms of the resolution [8]. To allow the Central to retract the concessions now would sanction fraud against the planters who relied on them [9].

**2. NO.** The Board of Directors had the authority to modify the proposed terms to make them acceptable to the planters [10]. Under the Business Judgment Rule, questions of policy or management are left to the honest decision of the officers and directors. The court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the board so long as they act in good faith [11]. The test for corporate power is whether the act is in direct and immediate furtherance of the corporation's business [10]. Since the resolution was passed in good faith to secure the contract extension, it is valid and binding regardless of whether it causes losses to the Central [11].

**Decision reversed and set aside.** Defendant is ordered to pay the differential participation to plaintiffs [12].
