I. CAPTION
CONRADO VICTORINO, ET AL. v. PRIMITIVO ESPIRITU, G.R. No. L-17735, July 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Victorino et al., tenants of respondent Espiritu, obtained a favorable judgment in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) for crop liquidation, resulting in a deficiency judgment of P320.53 against Espiritu [1, 2]. An initial writ of execution failed due to a third-party claim and a subsequent injunction [3]. Petitioners then filed for an examination of the respondent's properties under Rule 39, Section 34 of the Rules of Court [4]. Upon examination, the CAR found Espiritu had a net income of P600.00/month and ordered him to pay the deficiency in monthly installments of P50.00 [4, 5]. When Espiritu failed to pay the first installment, the CAR declared him in contempt and ordered his confinement in the Manila City Jail until he complied with the order [6]. Espiritu appealed, challenging the validity of the contempt order [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court properly ordered the respondent's confinement for contempt for failure to pay the judgment installments.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the Agrarian Court improperly exercised its discretion in ordering the respondent's confinement. The examination revealed that the respondent possessed real and personal properties (including landholdings, a piano, and sofas) yielding a net income of P600.00 monthly [5, 8]. Since the deficiency judgment was only P320.53, the respondent's remaining properties were more than sufficient to satisfy the debt through an *alias* writ of execution, even after deducting portions exempt from execution [8].

The Court held that the power to punish for contempt is drastic and extraordinary, and therefore should be "sparingly exercised" [9]. It should be used on a "preservative and not on the vindictive principle" and only in cases of "clear and contumacious refusal to obey" [9]. Since other legal remedies were available to satisfy the judgment, jailing the respondent was unnecessary.

The order was MODIFIED to direct the issuance of an *alias* writ of execution instead of confinement [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
