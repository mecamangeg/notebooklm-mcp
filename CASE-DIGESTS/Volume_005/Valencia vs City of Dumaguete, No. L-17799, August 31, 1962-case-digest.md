I. CAPTION
BENVENENCIO VALENCIA, ET AL. v. THE CITY OF DUMAGUETE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17799, August 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On June 6, 1959, Benvenencio Valencia and 28 other residents filed an action against the City of Dumaguete and various movie theater operators to recover surcharges collected from customers under City Ordinance No. 76, Series of 1954, as amended [1]. The plaintiffs claimed the ordinance was illegal and ultra vires [2]. They alleged that the subject matter was of common interest to about 30,000 persons, making it a class suit [3]. The City of Dumaguete filed a motion for a Bill of Particulars, requesting the specific amounts each plaintiff sought to recover, dates of movie attendance, and names of all plaintiffs [4]. The lower court ordered the plaintiffs to comply [5]. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint but failed to provide the specific details required, maintaining that the case was a class suit where such details were impracticable [5, 6]. Consequently, the lower court dismissed the complaint [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the complaint constitutes a proper class suit.
2. W/N the dismissal of the complaint for failure to submit a Bill of Particulars was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A class suit does not lie in an action for the recovery of amounts representing surcharges collected from 30,000 customers if no one plaintiff has any right to, or share in, the amounts individually claimed by others [8]. Under Section 12, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, a class suit requires the subject matter to be of common or general interest to many persons [9]. Here, each plaintiff has an interest exclusively in the return of what they personally paid [8]. The Court applied the rulings in *Berces v. Villanueva* and *Rallonza v. Evangelista*, holding that separate claims to distinct portions of property or money do not create the common interest required for a class suit [10].

2. **YES.** Since the case is not a proper class suit, the plaintiffs were required to specify their individual claims. The lower court correctly ordered the submission of a Bill of Particulars [7]. The plaintiffs' failure to comply with this order justified the dismissal of the action pursuant to Section 3, Rule 30 of the Rules of Court [7].

The Order of the lower court is UPHELD.
