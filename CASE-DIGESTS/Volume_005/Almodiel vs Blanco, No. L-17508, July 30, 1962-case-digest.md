I. CAPTION
ROMEO ALMODIEL v. JUDGE RAMON BLANCO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17508, July 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
In July 1958, petitioner Romeo Almodiel and respondent spouses Romulo Legarde and Adelina Latigay entered into a verbal tenancy agreement to operate a citrus nursery on the respondents' land in Lambunao, Iloilo [1]. Under the agreement, the petitioner would furnish all seedlings, seeds, and the technical know-how for the care, cultivation, budding, and balling of the citrus [2]. The respondents would furnish the land, necessary farm labor, chemicals, fertilizers, and the petitioner's board and lodging [2]. They agreed to share the produce in the proportion of 2/3 for the petitioner and 1/3 for the respondents [1].

On February 6, 1960, a dispute arose when petitioner alleged he was ejected from the land, while respondents claimed he abandoned the nursery [1], [2]. Almodiel filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) to recover his share [1]. The CAR dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that no tenancy relationship existed because the petitioner only contributed "scientific knowledge" and supervision, while the physical labor was furnished by the respondents [3], [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction over the controversy.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the agreement constitutes a tenancy relationship, falling under the jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR).

The Court found that the contract comes within the purview of "Agricultural Tenancy" as defined in Section 3 of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended [5]. The agreement involved the possession of agricultural land devoted to the production of agricultural products through the labor of one of the parties [5]. Specifically, the petitioner agreed to furnish the seedlings and technical know-how in the care and cultivation of the plants, sharing in the harvest with the respondents [5].

Under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1267, as amended, the CAR has original and exclusive jurisdiction over controversies involving relationships that determine the varying rights of persons in the cultivation and use of agricultural land where one of the parties works the land [6]. Since the relationship affects such rights, the CAR improperly dismissed the case.

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the case is **REMANDED** to the Court of Agrarian Relations for further proceedings [7].
