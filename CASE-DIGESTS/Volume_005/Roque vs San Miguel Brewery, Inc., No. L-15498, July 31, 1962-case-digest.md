I. CAPTION
LUCAS ROQUE v. SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC. and PHILIPPINE STEAM NAVIGATION COMPANY, G.R. No. L-15498, July 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Lucas Roque filed a complaint against San Miguel Brewery, Inc. and Philippine Steam Navigation Company. The Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a decision ordering Philippine Steam Navigation Co. to pay Roque the sum of P11,294.00 for damages, lost income, and fees, while dismissing the case against the other defendants [1]. Philippine Steam Navigation Co. appealed to the Supreme Court claiming the controversy exceeded P50,000.00, but it failed to file a brief [1, 2]. Roque also appealed to the Supreme Court, but his brief raised mainly questions of fact [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court should resolve the appeal given that the issues raised are mainly factual.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court declined to decide the case and instead certified it to the Court of Appeals. The Court found that the appellant Roque raised mainly questions of fact [2]. Although the amount involved was within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, the nature of the questions raised necessitated that the case be determined by the appellate court specifically tasked with factual review [3]. Pursuant to Section 31 of Republic Act No. 296 (Judiciary Act of 1948), as amended, the Court ordered the record of the appeal to be certified to the Court of Appeals for determination in accordance with law [4].
