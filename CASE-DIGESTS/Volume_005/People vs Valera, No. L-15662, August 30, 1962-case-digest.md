I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES vs. CARMELO VALERA alias MILING, G.R. No. L-15662, August 30, 1962, Makalintal, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On the morning of December 9, 1957, in Bangued, Abra, 62-year-old Guillermo Millare was approached by Carmelo Valera and Virgilio Navarro, who demanded money for gin [3]. When Guillermo refused, Navarro hit him, causing him to fall to the ground [3]. While Guillermo was prostrate, Valera suddenly darted towards him and stabbed him in the chest with a short bolo [3]. Guillermo died minutes later [4]. Valera claimed it was Navarro who killed the victim, but the trial court credited the testimony of the victim’s son and brother over the defense [5, 6]. Valera was convicted of murder and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*, while Navarro pleaded guilty to slight physical injuries [2, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the prosecution witnesses are credible despite their relationship to the victim.
2. W/N the killing was qualified by treachery.
3. W/N voluntary surrender is a mitigating circumstance even if warrants of arrest had already been issued.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The witnesses' relationship to the victim does not disqualify them or imply bias. In the absence of evidence regarding an improper motive to testify falsely, their testimony is worthy of full faith and credit (*People vs. Quiatchon*; *U.S. vs. Pajarillo*) [6]. Minor discrepancies between affidavits and court testimony do not impeach credibility where material points are consistent [8].

2. **YES.** The crime is murder qualified by treachery because the attack was sudden and unexpected, inflicted while the deceased was unarmed, prostrate on the ground, and in a defenseless position (*People vs. Casas*) [9].

3. **YES.** The issuance of arrest warrants prior to surrender does not bar the appreciation of voluntary surrender, as the law does not require surrender to precede the order of arrest (*People vs. Yecla*) [10]. However, this mitigating circumstance is offset by the aggravating circumstance of disregard of respect due to the victim's age (62 years old vs. appellant's 27 years) [10].

The decision is affirmed [11].
