I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ISMAEL LAMPITOC, G.R. No. L-16176, July 19, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On June 18, 1957, at around 1:00 A.M., an armed group attacked the house of spouses Aurelio Tagata and Brigida Baingan in Ilagan, Isabela. After the spouses handed over P2,000 through a hole in the door, the robbers forcibly broke in using an ax. Aurelio and his son, Petronilo, attempted to grab the intruders' firearms but were shot and killed. Another son, Honorato, managed to hack one robber, Cesar Pacho, with a bolo, causing the group to flee.

Investigation revealed Cesar Pacho dead from the wound. Co-accused Nemesio Gozum surrendered and implicated Ismael Lampitoc as one of the perpetrators. Honorato Tagata positively identified Lampitoc, and a buri hat belonging to Lampitoc was found at the crime scene. The Court of First Instance of Isabela convicted Lampitoc and his co-accused of robbery in band with double homicide, sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua*. While the others withdrew their appeals, Lampitoc appealed, relying on the defense of alibi.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Lampitoc was sufficiently identified as a perpetrator of the crime.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, ruling that the appellant's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt. The Court relied on the following circumstances which overcame the defense of alibi: (1) the positive identification by the victim’s son, Honorato Tagata; (2) the discovery of Lampitoc's buri hat at the scene of the crime; and (3) the testimony of Captain Cada regarding Lampitoc's verbal confession, which he later refused to sign upon the arrival of his father-in-law. The Court noted that even without the interlocking confessions of the co-accused, these facts were sufficient to establish participation. Although the crime of robbery in band with double homicide warrants the death penalty, the Court affirmed the lower court's imposition of *reclusion perpetua* due to the lack of sufficient votes for the capital punishment.

The decision of the lower court is affirmed *in toto*.
