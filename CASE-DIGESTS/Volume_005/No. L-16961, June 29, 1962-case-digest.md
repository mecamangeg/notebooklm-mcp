I. CAPTION
EMILIO SY, SILVINO CLARETE and FLORENCIO CALUGCUG v. HON. PATRICIO CENIZA, PERSHING TAN QUETO and ANTONIO YAP HOCKUN, G.R. No. L-16961, June 29, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
In a civil case for specific performance and breach of contract (Civil Case No. 1828), respondents Tan Queto and Yap Hockun (theater owners) obtained a preliminary mandatory injunction against film producers Sevilla and Ranillo. To dissolve the injunction, the producers filed a counterbond of P20,000, with petitioners Sy, Clarete, and Calugcug acting as sureties [1]. On April 29, 1957, the trial court rendered judgment ordering the producers to pay damages to the respondents. This judgment became final and executory [2].

When the writ of execution against the producers was returned unsatisfied, the court issued a notice on February 18, 1959—nearly two years after the judgment—threatening to sell the sureties' property to satisfy the obligation [2]. The petitioners objected, arguing that the counterbond answered only for damages arising from the dissolution of the injunction and that any claim against it was barred after final judgment. Respondent Judge Ceniza denied the objection and allowed a hearing to prove damages against the bond [3]. The petitioners filed for certiorari and prohibition [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the sureties on a counterbond may be held liable for damages after the judgment in the main case has become final and executory.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the claim for damages against the sureties was barred. Under Section 9, Rule 60 of the Rules of Court, which applies the procedure in Section 20 of Rule 59, an application for damages resulting from the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction (or its dissolution via counterbond) must be filed "before the trial or before entry of final judgment," with due notice to the other party and the surety [5], [6].

The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Alliance Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. v. Piccio*, stating that damages must be awarded upon proper application and hearing and included in the final judgment. The remedy is exclusive; failure to file the motion and notify the surety while the judgment is still under the court's control results in the loss of the right to such damages [5]. Since the judgment here had already become final without notice to the sureties, they are relieved from liability [7].

The writs prayed for were granted, and the orders of the respondent court were annulled and set aside [8].
