I. CAPTION
MARIA ELLI, ET AL. v. JUAN DITAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17444, June 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Elli filed a forcible entry case against defendants Ditan et al. in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Bacon, Sorsogon. The JP Court ruled in favor of plaintiffs. Defendants, through their counsel Atty. Fernando Gerona, Jr., appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Sorsogon. The Clerk of Court of the CFI sent the "Notice of Appealed Case" directly to the parties (the defendants personally) and not to their counsel. The defendants received the notice but failed to file an answer. Consequently, the CFI declared them in default and rendered judgment against them. Defendants moved for reconsideration, arguing that the default was improper because their counsel was never notified. The CFI denied the motion, ruling that in appeals from JP courts, notice sent to the parties themselves is sufficient.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N service of the notice of the appealed case upon the parties personally, instead of their counsel of record, is valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that under Section 2, Rule 27 and Section 7, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court, service of notice should be made on the party only if they are not represented by counsel. The moment a party appears by counsel, notice and other processes must be served upon said counsel. Service upon the party himself is not considered service in law (*Palad v. Cui*). While Rule 40 requires notification to "parties," this term refers to litigants who are not represented by a lawyer, which is common in JP courts. However, once an attorney appears for a party, notice must be given to the attorney.

The Order appealed from is **SET ASIDE**, and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further and appropriate proceedings.
