I. CAPTION
J. M. TUASON & CO., INC. v. JOSE RAFOR, G.R. No. L-15537, June 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff J. M. Tuason & Co., Inc., the registered owner of a parcel of land in Quezon City covered by TCT No. 1267, filed a complaint for recovery of possession against defendant Jose Rafor [1], [2]. Rafor had allegedly entered the property in 1950 and constructed two houses [2]. Rafor filed an answer claiming he purchased the land in 1949 from Agustin Torres, a successor-in-interest of Telesforo Deudor [3], [4]. On March 16, 1959, the day before the scheduled trial and 25 days after filing his answer, Rafor filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of *lis pendens*, citing a pending action for reconveyance (Civil Case No. Q-4057) filed by Torres' successor against the plaintiff [5], [6]. The Court of First Instance denied the motion as it was filed for delay and proceeded to judgment, ordering Rafor to vacate the premises and pay monthly rentals [7], [8]. Rafor appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in denying the motion to dismiss based on the pendency of another action (*lis pendens*).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the lower court's decision.
First, under Section 1, Rule 8 of the Rules of Court, a motion to dismiss on the ground of pendency of another action must be filed "within the time for pleading," meaning within the time to answer [10], [6]. The defendant violated this rule by filing the motion 25 days after he had already filed his answer [11], [6].

Second, the fourth requisite of *lis pendens*—that the judgment to be rendered in the first case would amount to *res judicata* in the second—was absent [12], [13]. Even if the plaintiff won the pending reconveyance case, the present action would still need to proceed to determine the defendant's liability for the unlawful detention of the property [13].

The Court further held that the defendant's claim of being a builder in good faith raised a question of fact which could not be reviewed in an appeal limited to questions of law [14].

**Judgment affirmed.** [15]
