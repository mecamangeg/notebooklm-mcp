I. CAPTION
SALVADOR PANLILIO v. COURT OF APPEALS and PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16955, May 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On October 16, 1957, petitioner Salvador Panlilio received P1,000.00 from complainant Roberto Surla. Panlilio issued a receipt acknowledging that the money was received in trust "for the purpose of buying commercial goods and articles for the said Roberto Surla" to be resold in Camarines Norte [1], [2]. The agreement stipulated that if Panlilio failed to buy the goods, he must return the amount to Surla within one week [2].

After receiving the money, Panlilio left Daet on October 17 and never returned to account for the goods or the money, despite demands [3]. Panlilio was charged with estafa. He argued that a partnership existed between him and Surla, and since there was no liquidation yet, there could be no estafa [4]. He also claimed he bought cigarettes which were stolen, accounting for part of the funds [5]. The Court of First Instance convicted him of estafa. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but modified the indemnity to P358.60, deducting the value of the stolen cigarettes (P641.40) from the original P1,000 [6], [5]. Panlilio appealed to the Supreme Court via certiorari [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is guilty of estafa despite his defense that a partnership existed between him and the complainant.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, ruling that the defense of partnership was belied by the evidence, specifically the receipt signed by the petitioner [4]. The Court reasoned that in the written acknowledgment, Panlilio expressly stated the money was delivered "for the purpose of buying commercial goods and articles for the said Roberto Surla" and that if he failed to do so, the amount would be "returned to Surla" [4]. The Court held that had a partnership been established, the goods would have been purchased for the partnership, not for Surla individually [4]. Furthermore, the factual finding of the Court of Appeals giving no credence to the partnership evidence is binding on the Supreme Court in an appeal by certiorari [4]. The petitioner's failure to return the money or account for the goods constituted misappropriation [4]. The decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED [5].
