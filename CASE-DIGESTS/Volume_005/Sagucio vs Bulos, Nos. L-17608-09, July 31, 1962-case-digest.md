I. CAPTION
VICTORIANA SAGUCIO v. ADRIANO BULOS, G.R. Nos. L-17608-09, July 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Andres Sagucio, the father of Victoriana Sagucio (appellant), originally owned a homestead which he sold to Adriano Bulos (appellee) on April 21, 1944. On October 29, 1948, Victoriana filed Civil Case No. 142 to redeem the property under Section 119 of Commonwealth Act No. 141. The trial court ruled in her favor, which was affirmed with modification by the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court dismissed Bulos' subsequent petition for certiorari, and the judgment allowing redemption became final on October 26, 1956.

On June 25, 1959, Bulos filed Civil Case No. 1298 for Quieting of Title, alleging that Victoriana's right to repurchase had prescribed because more than 5 years had passed since the 1944 sale. On July 10, 1959, Victoriana filed a motion for the execution of the judgment in Civil Case No. 142. The lower court denied the motion for execution and declared Victoriana's right to repurchase as prescribed. Victoriana appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Victoriana Sagucio's right to repurchase the homestead has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the period to redeem has not elapsed. While Section 119 of Act No. 141 provides a five-year period for repurchase from the date of conveyance (April 21, 1944), the running of this period was interrupted by the filing of Civil Case No. 142 on October 29, 1948, which constituted a judicial demand [1, 2].

When prescription is interrupted by a judicial demand, the full time for the prescription must be reckoned from the cessation of the interruption [2]. The interruption ceased when the decision in Civil Case No. 142 became final on October 26, 1956 [2]. Furthermore, under Rule 39, Section 6 of the Rules of Court, a final judgment may be executed on motion within five years from the date of its finality [3]. Victoriana's motion for execution filed on July 10, 1959, was well within this five-year period. The Rules of Court apply in a suppletory character to land registration cases and the Public Land Act regarding the execution of judgments [4].

The decision appealed from is reversed.
