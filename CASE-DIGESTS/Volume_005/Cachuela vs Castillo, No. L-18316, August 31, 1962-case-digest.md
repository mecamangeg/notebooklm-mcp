**I. CAPTION**
RODOLFO CACHUELA, in his capacity as Acting Mayor of Calinog, Iloilo v. NATALIO P. CASTILLO, in his capacity as Executive Secretary, et al., and RICARDO PROVIDO, G.R. No. L-18316, August 31, 1962, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
On July 15, 1960, petitioner Cachuela (then Vice-Mayor) and five councilors filed an administrative complaint for neglect of duty and maladministration against respondent Mayor Ricardo Provido of Calinog, Iloilo [1]. The Provincial Board found Provido guilty and suspended him for two months [2]. Provido appealed to the Executive Secretary (Castillo). Cachuela filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo to restrain the Executive Secretary from acting on the appeal, arguing that Section 2191 of the Revised Administrative Code is unconstitutional because it allows the President to exercise "control" rather than merely "supervision" over local governments [3, 4]. Provido filed a counterclaim for damages [4].

The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the President’s appellate authority under the Administrative Code constitutes supervision, not control [5]. It also dismissed Provido's counterclaim [2]. Both parties appealed. During the pendency of the appeal, the two-month suspension expired on November 6, 1960, and the Executive Secretary rendered a decision on November 23, 1960, exonerating Provido [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petition for prohibition should be granted given the expiration of the suspension period.
2. W/N the respondent Mayor is entitled to damages on his counterclaim.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The case has become moot and academic. The act sought to be enjoined—the review of the appeal by the Executive Secretary—has already been performed, and the period of suspension imposed by the Provincial Board has expired [6]. Since there is nothing left to restrain, and the resolution of the constitutional question regarding Section 2191 of the Revised Administrative Code is not peremptorily necessary under the facts, the Court declined to pass judgment on the controversy [6].

2. **NO.** The administrative complaint filed by the petitioner and councilors is a "qualified privileged communication" [7]. In a government where authority emanates from the governed, it is the duty of citizens to bring abuses and maladministration to the attention of authorities [2]. As the lower court found no evidence of malice or bad faith on the part of Cachuela, the dismissal of the counterclaim was justified [7].

**Appeal dismissed as moot; decision of the lower court dismissing the counterclaim is affirmed.**
