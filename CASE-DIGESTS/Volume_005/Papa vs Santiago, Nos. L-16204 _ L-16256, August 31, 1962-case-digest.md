I. CAPTION
ERNESTO A. PAPA and CONRADO V. ATANACIO v. SEVERO J. SANTIAGO, G.R. Nos. L-16204 & L-16256, August 31, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Papa and Atanacio obtained a municipal franchise to operate a telephone service in Pasig, Rizal, after winning a public bidding in which respondent Santiago participated and lost. Petitioners filed an application for a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) with the Public Service Commission (PSC). Subsequently, the Municipal Council revoked Petitioners' franchise and granted a new one to Santiago, who then filed his own CPC application. In a previous appeal (G.R. No. L-12433), the Supreme Court declared the revocation of Petitioners’ franchise invalid and remanded the case to the PSC to determine who was better qualified, noting Petitioners' prior operative franchise and filing.

Upon remand, the PSC granted the CPC to Santiago. The PSC reasoned that Santiago was better qualified because he had already installed complete equipment, was operating (albeit without authority), and was financially more responsible, whereas Petitioners’ equipment was incomplete and uninstalled. Petitioners appealed, arguing that Santiago's advantages resulted from illegal operations and that they were qualified holders of a prior franchise.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission erred in granting the certificate of public convenience to Santiago over the petitioners who held a prior operative franchise and application.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the PSC decision.

The Court held that to offset the advantage of an applicant who has a prior application and operative franchise, the opposing applicant must not only prove superior equipment or preparation but also show that the prior applicant is not himself qualified. In this case, the PSC failed to find that Petitioners were unqualified or that their equipment was insufficient to render the proposed service.

Furthermore, Santiago’s alleged advantage of having installed equipment and immediate readiness was the result of his illegal operation of the telephone system without a CPC and in violation of PSC orders. The Court ruled that it is unjust to consider advantages obtained through illegal acts in favor of the violator. Additionally, the Court noted that Santiago already controlled telephone systems in several other provinces, and granting him the award would encourage a monopolistic trend prejudicial to public interest.

The decision of the Public Service Commission was SET ASIDE, and the application of Papa and Atanacio for a certificate of public convenience was GRANTED.
