I. CAPTION
ANGEL OTIBAR and ANASTACIO OTIBAR v. HON. DEMETRIO G. VINSON, JOAQUIN BADIABLE, CELSO INABAÑGAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18023, May 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Anastacio Rocha (predecessor-in-interest of petitioners Otibar) filed a forcible entry case against respondents Badiable and Inabañgan in the Justice of the Peace Court of Carigara, Leyte. On February 8, 1960, the court rendered judgment in favor of Rocha, ordering respondents to vacate and pay damages [1]. Respondents appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) presided by respondent Judge Vinson.

On June 11, 1960, Judge Vinson dismissed the appeal. However, he subsequently issued an order on November 12, 1960, requiring an ocular inspection of the land [2]. Rocha filed a motion praying for the return of the records to the Justice of the Peace Court, arguing that the CFI lost jurisdiction after dismissing the appeal. Judge Vinson denied the motion and continued to entertain various motions regarding execution and contempt [2, 3]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus, while respondents argued that petitioners were estopped by laches for participating in the proceedings despite the dismissal [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance retains jurisdiction to issue orders in a case after dismissing the appeal from the Justice of the Peace Court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that once an appeal from the Justice of the Peace Court to the Court of First Instance is dismissed, the latter court loses jurisdiction to proceed with the case [5]. The only step left for the CFI under such circumstances is to remand the case to the Justice of the Peace Court for the due execution of the judgment, which is revived upon the dismissal of the appeal [3]. The Court relied on established jurisprudence in *Capunu v. Llorente*, *Morco v. Muñoz*, and *Fortuna v. Viloria* [3, 5].

Regarding the respondents' defense, the Court held that jurisdiction cannot be conferred by laches or consent of the parties. The question of jurisdiction regarding the respondent Judge's authority to issue orders in a dismissed case may be raised at any stage of the proceedings [4].

Petition granted. Respondent Judge's orders subsequent to the dismissal of the appeal are declared null and void, and he is directed to remand the case to the Justice of the Peace Court for execution [6].
