I. CAPTION
LAO TECK SING v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-14735, July 31, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lao Teck Sing, a Chinese citizen born in Manila, filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [1, 2]. He claimed to possess all the qualifications required by law, including the ability to speak and write English and Tagalog [1, 3]. During the hearing, to test his language proficiency, the trial court and the Solicitor General required him to write and translate specific sentences in Tagalog. He struggled significantly; for instance, he failed to correctly write a dictated sentence regarding a trial involving "Ricardo Parulan" and completely failed to translate an English letter starting with "My dear friend" into Tagalog [4, 5]. Consequently, the CFI denied his application on the ground that he did not speak, read, and write Tagalog [1]. Lao Teck Sing appealed the decision.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner satisfactorily proved his ability to speak and write Tagalog as required for naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the denial of the petition. Under the Revised Naturalization Law, an applicant must possess the ability to speak and write one of the principal Philippine languages [1]. While the law does not set a specific standard of proficiency, the findings of the trial court, which had the opportunity to see and hear the applicant testify, must be given weight and value unless clearly erroneous [6, 7]. In this case, the petitioner failed practical tests during the trial, such as failing to translate a simple invitation letter and committing errors in writing dictated Tagalog sentences (e.g., writing "Nalibang" instead of "Naliban" and unintelligible phrases like "Saksalalang pak ilwas") [4]. These failures justified the trial court's conclusion that he did not possess the requisite language proficiency.

The decree denying the application for naturalization is affirmed [8, 9].
