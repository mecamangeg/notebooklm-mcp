I. CAPTION
TERESA REALTY, INC. v. MAXIMA BLOUSE DE POTENCIANO, G.R. No. L-17588, May 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Teresa Realty, Inc. leased a residential lot in Sta. Mesa, Manila to respondent Maxima Blouse de Potenciano. The lease contract expired on December 31, 1953. Prior to the expiration, the petitioner notified the respondent to vacate or pay an increased monthly rental of P127.30 (up from the previous annual rate). The respondent refused to pay or vacate [1].

The petitioner filed a detainer suit. The Municipal Court ordered the respondent to vacate and pay the increased rental. The Court of First Instance (CFI) affirmed the decision, rejecting the respondent's defense under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 1162 [2]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) initially affirmed the CFI in toto. However, upon a motion for reconsideration, the CA amended its decision and reduced the recoverable rental to 8% of the assessed value of the lot, applying Section 5 of R.A. No. 1599, which amended R.A. No. 1162 [2, 3]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the CA erred in applying the statutory ceiling [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the 8% rental ceiling provided in R.A. No. 1599 applies to the subject property.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the remedies granted to tenants under R.A. No. 1162 or its amendment, R.A. No. 1599—whether suspension of ejectment, payment by installments, or rental ceilings—do not apply where expropriation proceedings have not been commenced [5, 6].

The Court emphasized that the lot in question was not an estate subject to expropriation under said Acts [7, 8]. The rental restriction in Section 5 of R.A. No. 1599 is not independent legislation enforceable in every case; it applies only to estates to be expropriated. Construing the provision as a general rental ceiling for all properties would violate the constitutional prohibition against a bill embracing more than one subject not expressed in its title [9]. Reasonableness of rentals depends on the circumstances of each case and cannot be predicated exclusively on statutory ceilings intended for expropriated lands [10]. The Court found the rental fixed by the lower courts (amounting to roughly 12% of assessed value) to be reasonable [6].

The amended decision of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED** and set aside, and its original decision affirming the Court of First Instance is **AFFIRMED** [11].
