I. CAPTION
DANILO DAVID v. ALASKA LUMBER COMPANY, G.R. No. L-17458, May 30, 1962, Concepcion, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On June 2, 1960, Danilo David filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against his employer, Alaska Lumber Company, seeking P4,000.00 as compensation for injuries sustained during his employment on April 15, 1959 [3]. Alaska Lumber Company raised the affirmative defense that the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) had exclusive jurisdiction over the claim [3]. The CFI ruled in favor of David, ordering the company to pay P2,379.20 plus attorney's fees [2]. The company moved for reconsideration, arguing that the CFI lacked jurisdiction because the claim falls under the WCC's exclusive authority and the amount involved (P4,000) was within the Municipal Court's original exclusive jurisdiction [3]. After the motion was denied, the company appealed to the Supreme Court [3]. David argued that Paragraph 12, Article III of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A allows workmen to pursue claims in ordinary courts [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the claim for workmen's compensation. [3, 4]
2. W/N Reorganization Plan No. 20-A validly conferred jurisdiction to ordinary courts over compensation claims. [5]

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Workmen's Compensation Commission has exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide claims for compensation under Section 46 of the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 3428) [4]. Furthermore, even if ordinary courts had jurisdiction, the amount demanded (P4,000) fell within the original exclusive jurisdiction of the Municipal Court of Manila (which covered demands not exceeding P5,000 exclusive of interest and costs), not the Court of First Instance [6].

2. **NO.** Paragraph 12, Article III of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, which purported to grant concurrent jurisdiction to ordinary courts, is null and void [5, 7]. Republic Act No. 997, as amended by R.A. No. 1241, did not empower the Government Survey and Reorganization Commission to amend Section 46 of Act No. 3428 or to confer jurisdiction upon courts [5]. Such powers are essentially legislative in nature, and granting such authority to the Commission would constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power [5, 7].

The decision appealed from is **SET ASIDE**, the case is **DISMISSED**, and the writ of preliminary injunction is made permanent [6, 8].
