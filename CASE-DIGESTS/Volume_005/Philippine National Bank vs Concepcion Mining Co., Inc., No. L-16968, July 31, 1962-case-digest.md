I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. CONCEPCION MINING COMPANY, INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-16968, July 31, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Philippine National Bank (PNB) filed a complaint to recover the value of a promissory note from Concepcion Mining Company, Inc. and Jose Sarte. The note, dated March 12, 1954, stated "I promise to pay" and was signed by Concepcion Mining (through its President, Vicente Legarda), Vicente Legarda, and Jose Sarte [1, 2]. The defendants argued that the estate of their co-maker, Vicente Legarda, who was deceased, should have been included as a party-defendant in the case [2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled that the inclusion of the estate was unnecessary and sentenced the defendants to pay P7,197.26 jointly and severally [2, 3]. The defendants appealed, insisting on the necessity of including the deceased co-maker’s estate [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the creditor must include the estate of a deceased co-maker as a party-defendant in a suit to collect on a promissory note signed by multiple parties.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the inclusion of the deceased co-maker is not necessary. Under **Section 17(g) of the Negotiable Instruments Law**, when an instrument containing the words "I promise to pay" is signed by two or more persons, they are deemed to be jointly and severally liable thereon [5]. Furthermore, **Article 1216 of the Civil Code** provides that a creditor may proceed against any one of the solidary debtors or some of them simultaneously [5]. Consequently, PNB had the right to hold any one or two of the signers responsible for the full payment of the note without suing the others [6].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [7].
