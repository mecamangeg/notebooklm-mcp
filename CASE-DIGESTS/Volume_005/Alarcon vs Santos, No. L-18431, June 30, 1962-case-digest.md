I. CAPTION
RUFINO ALARCON, ET AL. v. PILAR SANTOS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18431, June 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, Rufino Alarcon and others, filed a petition for reinstatement and damages against respondent Pilar Santos before the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) of Pangasinan [1]. Petitioners were tenants working on land owned by Santos, which she had leased to Dionisio Alarcon, the petitioners' direct landholder. When the lease contract between Santos and Dionisio expired, Santos forcibly ejected the petitioners [1]. Santos argued that as the owner, she was entitled to exercise her proprietary rights [2].

The CAR dismissed the petition for want of jurisdiction. It reasoned that since the lease had expired and Dionisio (the lessee-landholder) was not made a party, there was no existing tenancy relationship between the petitioners and Santos, the owner [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the expiration of the lease contract between the landowner and the lessee-landholder extinguishes the tenancy relationship between the tenants and the landowner.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the expiration of the lease contract does not terminate the tenancy relationship. Under **Section 9 of Republic Act No. 1199** (Agricultural Tenancy Act), the expiration of the period of the contract as fixed by the parties does not of itself extinguish the relationship [4]. The law explicitly imposes upon the new landholder, purchaser, or transferee the duty to assume the rights and obligations of the former landholder in relation to the tenant [4, 5].

Therefore, even if the lease between Santos and Dionisio expired, the tenancy relationship survived, and Santos assumed the obligations of the former landholder. Consequently, the remedy for the dispossession of the tenants is to seek reinstatement with damages, a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations [5, 6].

The resolution of the agrarian court was SET ASIDE and the case was REMANDED for further proceedings [6].
