I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. IMAM SAWAH, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15333, June 29, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On November 5, 1954, Lorenzo Nuega was killed in Sulu [1, 2]. Imam Sawah, Usmal Jahad, and Sarail Tahil were charged with murder [3]. Jahad pleaded guilty, while Sawah and Tahil pleaded not guilty [3]. The prosecution's case rested on the testimony of Jahad, who stated that Sawah, harboring enmity against the victim, promised him P500.00 to kill Lorenzo [1, 2]. Jahad testified that Sawah planned the attack and accompanied them to the vicinity of the crime, where Jahad struck the victim from behind while Tahil distracted him [2, 4]. The Court of First Instance of Sulu convicted all accused, sentencing Sawah and Tahil to *reclusión perpetua* [3]. Both appealed, but Tahil later withdrew his appeal [1]. Sawah’s defense consisted merely of denials, challenging the credibility of his co-accused Jahad [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the testimony of the co-accused Jahad is credible and sufficient to convict Sawah.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, ruling that the issue was one of credibility [5]. The Court applied the doctrine that the absence of evidence as to an improper motive actuating the principal witness for the prosecution strongly tends to sustain the conclusion that no such improper motive existed, and that the testimony is worthy of full faith and credit, citing *People vs. De Otero* (51 Phil. 201) [6, 7]. Jahad was a friend of Sawah and had no reason to falsely implicate him in a serious crime [5]. The Court deferred to the trial judge's observation that Jahad testified with ease and without hesitation, rendering his positive testimony intrinsically credible over Sawah's mere denials [7, 8].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [9].
