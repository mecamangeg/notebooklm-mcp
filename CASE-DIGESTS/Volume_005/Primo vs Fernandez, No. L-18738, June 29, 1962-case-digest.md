I. CAPTION
CLAUDIO A. PRIMO v. THE HON. FIDEL FERNANDEZ, FRANCISCO ASTILLA, JR., and THE SHERIFF OF SAMAR, G.R. No. L-18738, June 29, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On May 17, 1955, in Civil Case No. 4403, plaintiff Francisco Astilla, Jr. and defendant Claudio A. Primo entered into a compromise agreement, leading the trial court to render a decision on the same day in accordance with said agreement [1]. On May 9, 1961, Astilla filed a motion for execution for the unpaid balance, which the court granted on May 13, 1961 [1]. Primo objected, arguing that more than five years had elapsed since the judgment was rendered, citing Section 6 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court [2]. The respondents countered that since the amount was due within two years from the decision (May 1957), the five-year period for execution by motion should be counted from that due date, making the 1961 motion timely [3]. The lower court denied Primo's motion for reconsideration and issued the writ, prompting Primo to file a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a judgment can be enforced by motion more than five years after its entry if the obligation therein became due at a later date.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that Section 6 of Rule 39 is positive that a judgment can be enforced by motion only within five years from its *entry*, not from the date when payment becomes enforceable [4]. Although the plaintiff's claim was not yet barred by prescription in 1961, the specific procedural remedy of enforcement by motion was no longer available [4]. After the expiration of five years from the entry of judgment on May 17, 1955, the judgment could only be enforced by instituting an ordinary action [4].

The petition is granted, and the preliminary injunction is made permanent [5].
