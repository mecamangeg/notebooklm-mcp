I. CAPTION
JUANA VDA. DE MARTEL, ET AL. v. JULIAN ADRALES Y FLORES and ALFREDO B. ZAMORA, G.R. No. L-16472, May 23, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On June 22, 1951, a taxicab driven by Julian Adrales and owned by Alfredo B. Zamora collided with a car driven by Enrique Martel, causing injuries to passenger Antonio C. Martel. Adrales was charged with serious physical injuries but pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of slight physical injuries through reckless imprudence in the Municipal Court of Manila. Antonio reserved his right to file a separate civil action [1, 2].

Subsequently, Antonio filed a civil suit for damages against Adrales and Zamora. The trial court found the accident was due entirely to Adrales' negligence and ordered him to pay damages. However, the court absolved the owner, Zamora, from liability, ruling that Zamora exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of his driver [3, 4]. The plaintiffs appealed, arguing the action was based on the crime committed, not *culpa aquiliana* [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the employer is subsidiarily liable for damages arising from his employee's criminal conviction despite proving the diligence of a good father of a family.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the employer is subsidiarily liable. The allegations in the complaint — specifically that the driver was convicted of slight physical injuries through reckless imprudence — clearly indicated that the cause of action was based on the crime committed (*ex delicto*) and not on *culpa aquiliana* (quasi-delict) [6-8].

Under the Revised Penal Code, the employer is subsidiarily liable for the civil liability arising from the crime committed by his employee in the discharge of his duties. The defense of "diligence of a good father of a family" is a defense available only in actions based on *culpa aquiliana* under the Civil Code, but it is not a defense against subsidiary liability arising from a crime [8, 9]. Consequently, the trial court erred in absolving Zamora. As the driver Adrales did not appeal and was declared insolvent, Zamora is subsidiarily liable for the amount of damages awarded [10, 11].

The judgment of the lower court is REVERSED, and Alfredo B. Zamora is declared subsidiarily liable for the damages.
