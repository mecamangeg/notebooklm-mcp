I. CAPTION
CORNELIO AMARO and JOSE AMARO v. AMBROSIO SUMANGUIT, G.R. No. L-14986, July 31, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On October 5, 1958, appellant Jose Amaro was assaulted and shot at near the government building of Silay City [1]. The following day, Jose and his father, Cornelio Amaro, went to the office of the defendant, Chief of Police Ambrosio Sumanguit, to request assistance regarding the crime. Instead of providing assistance, the defendant allegedly harassed and terrorized them, causing them to initially give up their right to prosecute the assailant [1]. The defendant also allegedly threatened to arrest the plaintiffs to force them to sign affidavits exculpating the police from any dereliction of duty [1], [2].

The Amaros filed a suit for damages in the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental based on Articles 21 and 27 of the Civil Code [3]. The lower court dismissed the complaint on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that the plaintiffs had other recourse, such as filing an administrative charge [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a cause of action was proper.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the facts alleged constitute an actionable dereliction of duty on the part of the Chief of Police under Article 27 of the Civil Code [6]. This article provides that any person suffering material or moral loss because a public servant refuses or neglects, without just cause, to perform his official duty may file an action for damages [4]. The refusal to give assistance to the complainants was a violation of the defendant's duty as an officer of the law [6].

While the Court acknowledged that the complaint was imperfectly drafted and vague, it ruled that an action should not be dismissed upon mere ambiguity or indefiniteness [2]. Such defects are grounds for a motion for a bill of particulars, not a motion to dismiss [2]. Furthermore, the Court clarified that the existence of other recourse, such as lodging an administrative charge or filing a complaint directly with the city attorney, does not preclude an action for damages under Article 27 [5].

The Order appealed from is set aside and the case is remanded to the Court of origin for further proceedings [7].
