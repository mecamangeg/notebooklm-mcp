I. CAPTION
EXEQUIEL FLORO v. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK and CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-15206, August 30, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Exequiel Floro obtained letters of credit from the Philippine National Bank (PNB) for importations. PNB's New York agency paid the drafts prior to the effectivity of Republic Act No. 601 (Exchange Tax Law). However, upon the arrival of the goods in Manila between April 17 and September 14, 1951, Floro paid PNB the drafts plus the 17% special excise tax totaling P25,010.49, pursuant to a Central Bank resolution interpreting the law.

On August 7, 1958, Floro filed a complaint for a refund, arguing that under the 1957 Supreme Court ruling in *PNB v. Zulueta*, the tax was not due because the foreign exchange was sold prior to the law's effectivity. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in Floro's favor. The Central Bank appealed, conceding that the tax was not legally due based on *Zulueta*, but argued that Floro's action was barred by prescription. Floro contended that the prescriptive period should run only from the 1957 *Zulueta* decision which effectively overruled the Central Bank's erroneous resolution.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for the refund of the illegally collected excise tax has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The action is barred by prescription. The Court held that an action to recover a tax unlawfully collected accrues from the date of collection, not from the date of a subsequent court decision interpreting the law correctly. Relying on *Nazario & Sons v. Central Bank*, the Court emphasized that mistakes of officers (like the Monetary Board) in the interpretation of laws cannot prejudice the Government or extend the time of the accrual of action.

Under Article 1145 of the Civil Code, actions upon a quasi-contract (such as a refund for unjust enrichment) must be commenced within six years. Since Floro paid the taxes in 1951 and only filed the complaint in 1958, more than six years had elapsed.

The judgment appealed from is set aside and the complaint dismissed.
