I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DOMINGO TELAN, CANUTO TELAN and AMANDO MACABALLUG, G.R. Nos. L-17921-22, June 29, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On September 21, 1958, at around 9:00 P.M. in a moonlit evening, Ramon Soriano, Severino Paguirigan, and Victoriano Malabug were walking home in Barrio Nagarag, Cabagan, Isabela, when they were ambushed and fired upon [3]. Soriano died from gunshot wounds, while Malabug was wounded in the thigh [4]. The motive was identified as "bad blood" arising from a previous case where the victims were convicted of malicious mischief for boloing carabaos belonging to the accused's family [5]. The accused—Domingo Telan, Canuto Telan, and Amando Macaballug—were identified by the surviving victims and the deceased’s widow [6, 7]. The accused raised the defense of alibi and questioned the identification, arguing that the witnesses failed to name them immediately to the police on the night of the crime [6, 8]. The Court of First Instance of Isabela convicted the accused of murder and frustrated murder, sentencing them to life imprisonment and indeterminate penalties, respectively [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused were positively identified as the culprits despite their alibi and the witnesses' initial failure to identify them due to shock. [6, 8]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, holding that the alibi set up by the appellants was unimpressive and supported exclusively by near relatives; thus, it failed to overcome the positive identification by prosecution witnesses who had no motive to falsely impute such a serious crime to innocent persons [9, 10]. The Court ruled that there is nothing unnatural in the inability of the widow and other eyewitnesses to give a coherent narration or identify the appellants on the same night of the event due to their "emotional shock and agitation," which was obvious even to the police [8, 11]. The witnesses, who were barriomates with the accused, positively recognized them during the ambush [6].

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED**, with the modification that the indemnity for the death of Ramon Soriano is increased to P6,000.00 [10].
