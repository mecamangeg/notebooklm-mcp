I. CAPTION
LUNETA MOTOR COMPANY v. A. D. SANTOS, INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-17716, July 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Nicolas Concepcion, a grantee of a certificate of public convenience (CPC) to operate a taxicab service, executed a chattel mortgage over said certificate in favor of Petitioner Luneta Motor Company to secure a loan. Concepcion later took a second loan from the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC), constituting a second mortgage on the same CPC. RFC eventually foreclosed on the second mortgage, and the CPC was sold to Amador D. Santos, who transferred it to Respondent A. D. Santos, Inc.

Meanwhile, Petitioner filed to foreclose its first mortgage. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in Petitioner's favor, and the CPC was sold at public auction to Petitioner. Petitioner then applied with the Public Service Commission (PSC) for the approval of the sale. Respondent opposed the application, moving to dismiss it on the ground that Petitioner’s Articles of Incorporation did not authorize it to engage in the taxicab business or operate as a common carrier. The PSC dismissed the application, ruling that Petitioner could not acquire the CPC because it was not authorized to engage in land transportation.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Petitioner may acquire and hold a certificate of public convenience to operate a taxicab service given its Articles of Incorporation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the PSC's decision. Under Section 13(5) of the Corporation Law, a corporation may only purchase and hold such real and personal property "as the purpose for which the corporation was formed may permit, and the transaction of its lawful business may reasonably and necessarily require."

The Court found that while Petitioner's Articles of Incorporation authorized it to deal in automobiles and accessories and to engage in the transportation of persons by *water*, it was not authorized to engage in the business of *land* transportation. The Court held that land transportation is an entirely different line of business. Therefore, Petitioner may not acquire a CPC to operate a taxicab service because such acquisition would be without purpose and would have no necessary connection to its legitimate business.

The decision of the Public Service Commission is affirmed.
