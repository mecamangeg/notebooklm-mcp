**I. CAPTION**
GODOFREDO NAVERA v. HON. PERFECTO QUICHO, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-18339, June 29, 1962, Bautista-Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
On January 24, 1961, the Municipality of Ligao filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Albay under Section 112 of Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act) to correct Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-9304 issued to Godofredo Navera [1]. The Municipality alleged that during the cadastral survey, a 123-square-meter portion of Natera Street was erroneously included in Navera's lot (Lot No. 2793-A) [1, 2]. Navera moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction under Section 112 because the relief sought involved the reopening of an original decree of registration issued 23 years prior and the alteration of the technical description [1, 3]. Respondent Judge Quicho denied the motion to dismiss [2]. Navera filed a petition for certiorari, contending that the issue was controversial and thus outside the summary nature of Section 112 [2, 4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to entertain the petition for correction of title under Section 112 of Act No. 496 when the ownership of the land to be excluded is disputed.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that relief under Section 112 of Act No. 496 can only be granted if there is **unanimity among the parties**, or if there is no adverse claim or serious objection on the part of any party in interest [5]. In this case, unanimity is lacking because Navera disputes the Municipality's factual claim that the 123-square-meter portion is part of Natera Street [4].

The Court explained that while Section 39 of Act 496 provides that a public highway is deemed excluded from a certificate of title even if not noted therein, this principle only applies if there is no dispute that the portion in question is indeed part of a public highway [6]. Because the issue is controversial, it must be threshed out in an ordinary case, not in the summary proceeding under Section 112 [5].

Petition granted; orders set aside [7].
