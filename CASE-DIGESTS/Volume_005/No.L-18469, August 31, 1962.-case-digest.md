I. CAPTION
MUNICIPAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF BANSUD, ORIENTAL MINDORO, ET AL. v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18469, August 31, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
This case involves the disputed mayoralty of Bansud, Oriental Mindoro between Filemon Salcedo, Jr. and Leon Manpusti, which had reached the Supreme Court three times prior [1]. In previous rulings, the Court upheld the Commission on Elections' (COMELEC) authority to annul Salcedo’s proclamation and order a new canvass using the COMELEC's copy of election returns, as the municipal treasurer's copy was found to be falsified [2, 3].

Pursuant to the Court's final decision, the COMELEC ordered the Municipal Board of Canvassers to reconvene and canvass the votes [4]. However, the members of the board refused to comply. They argued they might be held in contempt of the Court of First Instance because Salcedo had filed a motion for reconsideration regarding the lower court's order dissolving a preliminary injunction against the canvass [4]. Consequently, the COMELEC suspended the refusing members, appointed substitutes, and the reconstituted board proceeded to proclaim Manpusti [5, 6]. The suspended members filed this petition questioning the COMELEC's authority to suspend and substitute them [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the COMELEC may suspend and substitute members of the Municipal Board of Canvassers who refuse to comply with its order to canvass.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the COMELEC acted properly and within its functions and prerogatives in suspending the petitioners and appointing substitutes [8]. The Court found the petitioners' refusal to canvass to be based on a "flimsy" pretext [9, 10]. The lower court had already dissolved the writ of preliminary injunction and dismissed the petition for recount because it lacked jurisdiction, a finding stemming from the COMELEC's ruling on the falsified returns which the Supreme Court had impliedly upheld [8].

The petitioners were ordered to comply with their duty by a "superior constitutional authority whose power under the law is clear" [10]. Their refusal was characterized by the Court as an open defiance and an attempt to "filibuster" and delay the proclamation of the winning candidate through a ruse [10]. Therefore, the suspension was a valid exercise of COMELEC's power to enforce election laws.

Petition denied [11].
