I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. ROMAN CANSINO, JR., SHERIFF OF MANILA and MAGDAYO RAMIREZ, G.R. No. L-17923, May 26, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On October 1, 1960, Philippine Navy Commander Abraham Campo and his agents seized 85 tubs of fish from the fishing boat "TONY LEX I" in Navotas, Rizal. The seizure was conducted after a Fishery Product Examiner determined that the fish had been killed or caught using dynamite. Consequently, criminal complaints for illegal possession of dynamited fish and disobedience were filed against Magdayo Ramirez, the alleged owner, in the Justice of the Peace Court of Navotas.

Ramirez filed a complaint for replevin in the Municipal Court of Manila, presided by Judge Roman Cansino, Jr., to recover the fish. Judge Cansino issued a warrant of seizure directing the Sheriff to take possession of the fish and deliver them to Ramirez. Commander Campo, representing the Republic, filed an urgent petition to return the fish, arguing they were the subject of a crime. However, Judge Cansino ordered the release of the fish to Ramirez unless a redelivery bond was posted. The Republic filed a petition for prohibition and injunction with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, but the CFI dismissed the petition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the seizure of the 85 tubs of fish was valid despite the absence of a search warrant and the provision in R.A. 428 regarding the taking of samples.
2. W/N the Republic is required to post a redelivery bond to retain possession of the seized items.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The seizure was valid. The Court ruled that Section 4 of R.A. 428, as amended by R.A. 1535, which authorizes officers to take samples of not more than one kilo for examination, applies when fish are merely "believed" to have been dynamited. In this case, there was already a positive finding by a Fishery Product Examiner that the fish were caught with dynamite. Under the law, the "mere possession" of such fish is a crime. Therefore, the fish were the subject and proceeds of an offense. Since the possession of the contraband constitutes a crime committed in the presence of the officer, the seizure is valid even without a search warrant, pursuant to the doctrine in *Magoncia v. Palacio* (80 Phil. 770).

2. **NO.** The Court held that the Republic of the Philippines is exempt from the obligation to post a redelivery bond as a condition precedent to the dissolution of the warrant of seizure.

The order appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the respondents are enjoined from delivering the fish to Ramirez.
