I. CAPTION
LANDAWI PARASAN BILAAN, ET AL. v. VICENTE N. CUSI, ETC., G.R. No. L-18179, June 29, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Landawi Parasan, Antik Felix, and Eris Seroc were charged with robbery with multiple homicide before the Court of First Instance of Davao. They were Bilaans who did not understand English, Spanish, Tagalog, or Visayan [1]. Despite government efforts to find an interpreter, the arraignment and the prosecution's presentation of evidence—including the admission of the accused's alleged extrajudicial confessions—proceeded without one [1]. During this time, the accused were assisted by a counsel who did not know their dialect [2].

On November 4, 1960, the court finally secured Atty. Primo S. Ocampo, who spoke the Bilaan dialect. During the presentation of defense evidence, Atty. Ocampo called a witness to testify that the accused were beaten by police and constabulary members to force their confessions [3]. The fiscal objected to this testimony on the ground that the defense failed to make a reservation to dispute the voluntariness of the confessions when they were admitted [3]. Respondent Judge Cusi sustained the objection. Atty. Ocampo moved for reconsideration, arguing he only learned the confessions were involuntary after conferring with the accused in their dialect, but the motion was denied [3]. The petitioners filed a petition for certiorari.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defense should be allowed to present evidence regarding the involuntariness of the confessions despite failing to make a reservation during the prosecution's presentation of evidence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that in the interest of fairness and justice, the new counsel should be given an opportunity to present evidence regarding the circumstances under which the alleged confessions were made [4].

The Court reasoned that the accused were ignorant and lacked the benefit of an interpreter during the prosecution's evidence presentation [4]. Although they had counsel, said counsel did not know their dialect and could not have adequately prepared their defense or known that the confessions were involuntary [2]. It was only when Atty. Ocampo, who understood the dialect, appeared that the involuntary nature of the confessions was discovered [2]. The Court noted that allowing such evidence would not harm the prosecution, as they could disprove the defense's claims if they were untrue [4].

The petition was **GRANTED**, and the case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [5].
