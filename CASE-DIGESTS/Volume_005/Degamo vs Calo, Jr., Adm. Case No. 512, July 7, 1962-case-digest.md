I. CAPTION
ESTEBAN DEGAMO v. TRANQUILINO O. CALO, JR., Adm. Case No. 512, July 7, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Esteban Degamo filed administrative charges against respondent Tranquilino O. Calo, Jr. However, the charges involved in this administrative case were found to be directly involved in two cases pending before the Court of First Instance of Agusan: Civil Case No. 117, entitled *Tranquilino O. Calo, Jr. v. Villamor Dizon, et al.*, and Criminal Case No. 2347, entitled *People v. Tranquilino O. Calo, Jr.* [1]. Consequently, the respondent filed a motion to hold the administrative investigation in abeyance pending the resolution of these related cases [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the administrative investigation should be held in abeyance due to the pending civil and criminal cases involving the same charges.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court resolved to grant the respondent's motion. The Court reasoned that because the charges in the administrative case were directly involved in the pending civil and criminal cases in the Court of First Instance of Agusan, it was proper to suspend the proceedings [1]. The investigation of the administrative case was ordered held in abeyance until the Supreme Court receives notice of the final determination of the aforementioned civil and criminal cases [1].
