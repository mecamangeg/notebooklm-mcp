I. CAPTION
LUDOVICO ESTRADA, ET AL. v. HON. AMADO S. SANTIAGO AND PINDANGAN AGRICULTURAL COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-14180, May 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Pindangan Agricultural Company, Inc. (respondent) filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan against Ludovico Estrada and others (petitioners) regarding the possession of a parcel of agricultural land [1]. On February 28, 1958, the respondent Judge rendered a decision in favor of the corporation, ordering the Director of Lands to execute lease or sale documents in its favor and condemning petitioners to pay damages [2-4].

Respondent corporation subsequently filed a motion for immediate partial execution pending appeal, which the respondent Judge granted on June 18, 1958 [5]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari to annul the orders of execution [6, 7]. During the pendency of this certiorari petition, the Supreme Court decided the main appeal on the merits (G.R. No. L-14591) on April 25, 1962, reversing the lower court’s decision and finding that the petitioners were in lawful occupancy of the land [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the order for execution pending appeal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the order was issued with grave abuse of discretion. In view of the Court's decision in the main appeal (G.R. No. L-14591), it was established that the lower court's judgment was erroneous and that the petitioners were in lawful occupancy of the land by virtue of lawful orders from the Bureau of Lands and the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources [8].

The Court ruled that where the decision to be executed is erroneous, there can be no special reason to justify execution pending appeal, as it results in prematurely depriving petitioners of lawful possession and transferring it to a corporation not entitled to it [9, 10].

The orders complained of were set aside [10].
