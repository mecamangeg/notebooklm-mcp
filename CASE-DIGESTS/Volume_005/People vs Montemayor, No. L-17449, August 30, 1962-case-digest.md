I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ZOSIMO MONTEMAYOR and CIRIACO DUCUSIN, G.R. No. L-17449, August 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Zosimo Montemayor, President of Mindanao Agricultural College, and Ciriaco Ducusin, the property custodian, were charged with illegal use of public funds under Article 220 of the Revised Penal Code [1]. The Information alleged that between August and December 1958, Montemayor ordered Ducusin to use P1,911.64 from "students' property deposits"—funds collected to cover potential breakage or loss of equipment—to purchase gasoline and oil for the college [1, 2]. The prosecution argued this diverted funds appropriated by Resolution No. 18 of the Board of Trustees for the specific payment of student-incurred losses [2]. The accused filed a Motion to Quash, which the Court of First Instance of Bukidnon granted, dismissing the case on the ground that the deposits were not public funds appropriated by law or ordinance [3]. The prosecution appealed the order of dismissal [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the use of students' property deposits for the purchase of fuel constitutes the crime of illegal use of public funds under Article 220 of the Revised Penal Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the information [5].

While the Court agreed with the prosecution that the money constituted **public funds**, it held that no crime was committed [6, 7]. The Court explained that the "deposits" paid by students created a creditor-debtor relationship (a loan) rather than a deposit in the legal sense; thus, the college acquired ownership of the money, making them public funds upon receipt [6, 8].

However, under Article 220 of the Revised Penal Code, the crime requires the diversion of funds from the purpose for which they were "appropriated by law or ordinance" [7, 9]. The Court ruled that the students' payments had not been so appropriated. The Board's resolution requiring a later refund did not imply that repayment had to be made from the specific money received [7]. Since the refund could be satisfied from *any* available funds of the college, there was no specific appropriation for a particular purpose that the accused violated [7, 9].

**The order appealed from is affirmed.** [5]
