I. CAPTION
ALFONSO BUN RAMOS, ET AL. v. EMILIANO CONDEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22072, August 30, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On June 25, 1952, the respondents (Condez spouses) sold a two-hectare parcel of land to the petitioners (Ramos spouses) via a notarial deed [1]. In early 1956, petitioners discovered the land belonged to a third person, preventing them from occupying it [1, 2]. Upon being informed of this, respondent Emiliano Condez wrote a letter to petitioner Alfonso Bun Ramos on November 10, 1956, acknowledging the validity of the sale and promising to deliver the land [2]. On May 22, 1963, petitioners filed a complaint seeking the delivery of the land or its value [2]. Respondents filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing the action had prescribed and the complaint stated no cause of action [3]. The lower court dismissed the case, ruling that the action was for relief on the ground of fraud, which prescribes in four years under Article 1146 of the Civil Code, and thus barred since more than four years had passed since 1956 [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action has prescribed.
2. W/N the complaint states a sufficient cause of action despite vague allegations.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The action has not prescribed [5]. The Supreme Court held that the action is not for fraud, but upon a written contract (the deed of sale) seeking specific performance or rescission, which prescribes in ten years under Article 1144 of the Civil Code [5, 6]. Although the cause of action accrued on the date of sale (June 25, 1952), the running of the prescriptive period was interrupted by the respondents' letter dated November 10, 1956 [5]. Under Article 1155 of the Civil Code, a written acknowledgment of the debt or obligation interrupts prescription [7]. Consequently, the filing of the suit on May 22, 1963, was well within the ten-year period from the interruption [5].

2. **YES.** The complaint states a sufficient cause of action [8]. The test of sufficiency is whether, admitting the facts alleged, a valid judgment can be rendered thereon [8]. While the complaint suffered from ambiguity regarding the specific relief sought (specific performance vs. rescission), it contained the ultimate facts constituting the petitioners' cause of action [9]. The Court ruled that where allegations are vague or indefinite, the proper recourse is a motion for a bill of particulars, not a motion to dismiss [9].

The Order appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS (if any)
