I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PANCHO PELAGIO Y ALFONSO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16177, May 24, 1967, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On March 23, 1955, Pancho Pelagio, Oscar Caymo, Jose Guico, Armando Manalang, and Arcadio Balmeo conspired to rob the house of Severina de Gloria in Pasay City. During the planning, Guico explained the location and entry points of the house. However, Guico was absent during the finalization of the plan on March 24 and the actual robbery.

During the execution, Caymo and Balmeo entered the house and robbed the victim at gunpoint, while Pelagio acted as lookout at the gate. Before Caymo and Balmeo exited, Pelagio fled, believing the police had been summoned. Caymo and Balmeo then boarded a taxi where Manalang was waiting. When a police jeep blocked them, Caymo shot and killed Pat. Francisco Trinidad.

The Court of First Instance of Pasay City convicted Pelagio, Caymo, and Guico of robbery with homicide and sentenced them to death. Caymo claimed alibi; Pelagio argued he was liable only for robbery; and Guico claimed he desisted from the conspiracy.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Oscar Caymo’s defense of alibi is valid.
2. W/N Pancho Pelagio (lookout) is liable for robbery with homicide.
3. W/N Jose Guico is criminally liable as a conspirator despite his absence during the execution of the crime.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Alibi is the weakest of all defenses and is rejected when the identity of the accused is sufficiently established. Caymo was positively identified by the victim and the taxi driver, and he tested positive for nitrate burns. His alibi cannot prevail over positive identification and physical evidence.

2. **NO.** Pelagio is liable only for **simple robbery**. The Court held that Pelagio had fled his post before the homicide occurred during the other conspirators' escape. There was no evidence that homicide was part of the original plan. Since the crime was not "robbery in band" (as only three participated and only one was armed), Pelagio cannot be held collectively liable for the killing committed by Caymo during the flight in which Pelagio did not participate (citing *People v. Basisten*).

3. **NO.** Guico is **acquitted**. While Guico participated in the initial planning, his absence from the final meeting and the actual robbery indicates voluntary desistance. Conspiracy alone, without the execution of its purpose, is not a crime except in special instances not applicable here (Article 8, Revised Penal Code). A conspirator who voluntarily desists before the crime is carried out is free from penal accountability (citing *People v. Timbol*).

**Disposition:** Judgment MODIFIED. Oscar Caymo is sentenced to DEATH. Pancho Pelagio is sentenced for SIMPLE ROBBERY. Jose Guico is ACQUITTED.
