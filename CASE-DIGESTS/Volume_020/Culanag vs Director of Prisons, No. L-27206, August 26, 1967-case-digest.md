**I. CAPTION**
**ANDRES S. CULANAG v. DIRECTOR OF PRISONS**, G.R. No. L-27206, August 26, 1967, 20 SCRA 1123, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Andres Culanag was convicted of falsification of a public document (Crim. Case No. 671) and imprisoned [1, 2]. He was later discharged on parole with the condition that if he violated any terms, the unexpired portion of his sentence would be served [2]. While on parole, Culanag committed another act of falsification, leading to new convictions for falsification (Crim. Case No. 790) and Violation of Conditional Pardon under Article 159 of the Revised Penal Code (Crim. Case No. 789) [3-5]. Simultaneously, the Board of Pardons and Parole ordered his arrest to serve the remaining unexpired portion of his original sentence in Crim. Case No. 671 [4]. After serving the sentences for the new crimes, Culanag filed a petition for habeas corpus, arguing that since he had already been prosecuted and convicted for Violation of Conditional Pardon under Article 159, he could no longer be compelled to serve the unexpired portion of the original sentence [6, 7]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the petition [7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a parolee convicted of Violation of Conditional Pardon under Article 159 of the Revised Penal Code can still be recommitted to serve the unexpired portion of his original sentence under Section 64(i) of the Revised Administrative Code.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the power of the Chief Executive under Section 64(i) of the Revised Administrative Code to arrest and re-incarcerate any person who violates his parole condition stands even in the face of prosecution, conviction, and service of sentence for violation of conditional pardon under Article 159 of the Revised Penal Code [8]. Citing *Sales v. Director of Prisons*, the Court ruled that the administrative authority to recommit the prisoner exists independently of the criminal prosecution [8]. Furthermore, there is no double jeopardy because the sentences refer to different offenses (falsification vs. violation of conditional pardon), and there is no deprivation of liberty without due process as the petitioner was convicted after due hearing [8]. The order of dismissal was affirmed [9].
