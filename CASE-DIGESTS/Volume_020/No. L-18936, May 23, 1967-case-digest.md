I. CAPTION
INTESTATE ESTATE OF ENCARNACION ELCHICO VDA. DE FERNANDO, Deceased. NATIVIDAD E. IGNACIO and LEONOR E. ALMAZAN, Administratrices-Appellants, v. PAMPANGA BUS COMPANY, INC., Claimant-Appellee, G.R. No. L-18936, May 23, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
In 1951, Pampanga Bus Company (Pambusco) filed a civil suit against Encarnacion Elchico Vda. de Fernando to collect P105,000. Encarnacion died in 1955 while the case was pending. Intestate proceedings were opened, and a notice to creditors was issued. In the civil case, the estate’s administrator substituted the deceased without objection, filed an amended answer with a counterclaim, and actively participated in the trial. The trial court eventually ruled in favor of Pambusco, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.

While the civil appeal was pending in 1959, Pambusco registered a "contingent" claim in the intestate proceedings. After the civil judgment became final in 1961, Pambusco moved the probate court to order the administratrices (Ignacio and Almazan) to pay the judgment debt. The administratrices opposed, arguing the claim was barred by the statute of non-claims as it was filed outside the six-month period provided in the notice to creditors. The probate court allowed the claim.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the money claim is barred by the statute of non-claims.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the claim was not barred and must be paid.

First, while Section 21, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court provides that a money claim against a deceased defendant should be dismissed and filed in the probate proceedings, this rule is procedural and can be waived. By substituting the deceased, filing a counterclaim, and actively litigating the civil case through three courts, the estate waived its right to have the claim re-litigated in the estate proceedings.

Second, the revival and prosecution of the civil action against the administrator is considered equivalent to the actual presentation of the claim in the probate court (citing 21 Am. Jur. 578).

Finally, under Section 2, Rule 86 (formerly Rule 87), the probate court may allow a claim to be filed at any time before the order of distribution for cause shown. The pendency of the civil action constituted a good excuse for the tardy filing of the claim in the intestate proceedings. The probate court's order allowing payment impliedly granted Pambusco an extension of time to file said claim.

The order of the lower court is affirmed.
