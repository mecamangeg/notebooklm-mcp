I. CAPTION
FILIPINAS INVESTMENT & FINANCE CORPORATION v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-23501, May 16, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On April 13, 1961, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) issued an assessment against Filipinas Investment & Finance Corporation for P5,007.00 as advance sales tax on an automobile purchased from a tax-exempt individual, plus a compromise penalty [1]. On May 15, 1961, the corporation disputed the assessment and requested its cancellation or withdrawal [2]. The CIR denied this request in a letter dated August 17, 1962 [3].

Instead of appealing, the corporation sent another letter on September 28, 1962, reiterating its request for cancellation [3]. The CIR denied this second request on July 22, 1963, which the corporation received on August 12, 1963 [4]. Consequently, the corporation filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) on September 11, 1963 [4]. The CIR moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that it was filed beyond the 30-day period prescribed in Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125 [5]. The CTA dismissed the petition, ruling that the period should be counted from the first denial (August 17, 1962) rather than the second denial [6]. The corporation appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the period should be reckoned from the receipt of the second denial [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for review was filed within the jurisdictional 30-day period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. The Court held that the assessment became a "disputed assessment" when the petitioner requested its cancellation on May 15, 1961 [7]. The CIR's letter of August 17, 1962, denying that request, constituted the decision appealable to the CTA under Sections 7 and 11 of Republic Act No. 1125 [7].

The petitioner's subsequent letter of September 28, 1962, was merely a *pro forma* request for reconsideration because it did not adduce new facts or arguments [7]. The Court emphasized that the 30-day period to appeal is jurisdictional and non-extendible [8]. A taxpayer cannot indefinitely delay a tax assessment by reiterating original defenses without substantial variation [8]. Since the petition was filed based on the second denial rather than the first, it was filed out of time.

The resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [9].
