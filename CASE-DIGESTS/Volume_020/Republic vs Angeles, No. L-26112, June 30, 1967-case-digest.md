I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, et al. v. HON. JAIME DE LOS ANGELES, et al., G.R. No. L-26112, June 30, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
The Republic of the Philippines filed a suit (Civil Case No. 373) against Ayala y Cia and the Dizons to annul titles covering portions of territorial waters and foreshore lands. The Court of First Instance (CFI) rendered judgment annulling the titles, ordering the Dizons to vacate in favor of intervenor Miguel Tolentino, and ordering "all the defendants to pay said intervenor, jointly and severally compensatory damages." On appeal (G.R. No. L-20950), the Supreme Court affirmed the annulment but modified the ruling on damages, holding that the Dizons, being purchasers in good faith, had a right of retention and were not liable for damages.

When the SC decision became final, the Republic and intervenors moved for execution. Respondent Judge De Los Angeles initially issued the writ but later quashed it and denied subsequent motions for execution. The Judge argued the SC decision was vague and required clarification because the absolution of the Dizons from liability allegedly extinguished the "joint and several" obligation of the other defendants (Ayala y Cia) under Article 1217 of the Civil Code. The petitioners filed this action for certiorari and mandamus.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may refuse to issue a writ of execution on the ground that the solidary obligation was extinguished when the Supreme Court absolved one of the solidary debtors from liability.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The respondent Judge’s contention is devoid of merit. Article 1217 of the Civil Code refers to the effect of payment by a solidary debtor, while Article 1215 refers to remission. Neither applies here because no payment was made, nor was there a remission of an existing debt. The Supreme Court's previous decision did not remit a solidary obligation of the Dizons; rather, it established that they were *never* under any obligation to pay damages because they were possessors in good faith [1, 2]. The lower court's attempt to create a solidary obligation was simply frustrated by the appellate ruling that such obligation did not exist regarding the Dizons [2].

It is the ministerial duty of the trial court to issue a writ of execution for the enforcement of a final and executory judgment, even if the Presiding Judge entertains doubts as to its validity [3, 4]. The Petition is granted; the orders quashing the writ are set aside, and the respondent Judge is directed to issue the writ of execution [5].
