I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HONORABLE JUDGE HERNANDO PINEDA, TOMAS NARBASA, TAMBAC ALINDO and RUFINO BORRES, G.R. No. L-26222, July 21, 1967, 20 SCRA 748, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of July 29, 1965, the spouses Teofilo Mendoza and Valeriana Bontilao de Mendoza and their children were asleep in their home in Iligan City [1]. The accused (Narbasa, Alindo, and Borres) fired guns and a *paliuntod* (homemade gun) into the house, killing Teofilo [1]. They then destroyed the door, entered, and killed three minor children (Neceforo, Epifania, and Marcelo) and wounded Valeriana [1].

The City Fiscal filed five separate informations: four for murder and one for frustrated murder [2]. The accused moved to consolidate these into "one (1) criminal case," arguing the acts arose from the same incident and impulse [3]. Respondent Judge Pineda granted the motion, ordering the filing of a single information for multiple murder and dropping the other four cases to avoid multiple trials [3, 4]. The Fiscal moved for reconsideration, arguing that separate shots were fired killing separate victims, but the motion was denied [4]. The People filed a petition for certiorari to annul the Judge's orders [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the killing of multiple victims through separate shots constitutes a single complex crime.
2. W/N the Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in compelling the Fiscal to file a single information for a complex crime.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The killing of multiple victims through separate acts constitutes separate crimes, not a complex crime. Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code applies only when a "single act constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies" [6]. The Court distinguished this from cases where a single bullet or bomb kills multiple people [7]. Deeply rooted jurisprudence establishes that "when various victims expire from separate shots, such acts constitute separate and distinct crimes" [8]. Here, the accused fired multiple shots and performed distinct acts of entering the house and killing the victims individually [1, 9]. Thus, five separate crimes were committed [10].

2. **YES.** The discretion to institute criminal charges belongs to the prosecuting attorney [11]. The Fiscal is not compelled to file an information if the evidence does not support it, and his discretion should not be controlled by the offended party or the Judge absent a clear abuse [12]. The Judge cannot substitute his judgment for that of the Fiscal regarding which crime to charge [11]. The Court granted the petition, set aside the respondent Judge's orders, and directed the reinstatement of the five separate criminal cases [13].
