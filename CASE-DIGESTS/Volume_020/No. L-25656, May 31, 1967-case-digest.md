I. CAPTION
NAZARIO NALOG v. NEMESIO DE GUZMAN, G.R. No. L-25656, May 31, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
In the November 12, 1963 general elections, Nazario Nalog and Nemesio de Guzman were candidates for Vice-Mayor of Antipolo, Rizal. The municipal board of canvassers proclaimed De Guzman elected with a plurality of five votes. Nalog filed an election protest (Case No. 7921) in the Court of First Instance of Rizal. The CFI rendered a decision declaring Nalog elected with 2,048 votes against De Guzman’s 2,038, a margin of ten votes. De Guzman appealed to the Supreme Court. Nalog challenged the appeal, arguing that under Section 178 of the Revised Election Code, decisions of the CFI in protests involving vice-mayors and municipal councilors are not appealable.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review the decision of the Court of First Instance regarding the position of Vice-Mayor.
2. W/N the lower court correctly appreciated the contested ballots.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While Section 178 of the Revised Election Code (Republic Act No. 180) implies a denial of the right to appeal CFI decisions in protests involving vice-mayors and councilors to the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court, this restriction applies to questions of fact. However, whenever questions purely of law are raised, a review may be sought from the Supreme Court under Article VIII, Section 2 of the Constitution [1, 2].

2. **PARTIALLY YES, PARTIALLY NO.** The Court reviewed specific ballot appreciations raised as questions of law:
    *   **Stray Votes:** Votes for Nalog written on the space for *councilor* are stray votes and cannot be counted pursuant to Section 149(3) of R.A. No. 180 [3].
    *   **Idem Sonans:** The name "Narog" or "Naro" written on the vice-mayor space is *idem sonans* with Nalog and is valid [4, 5].
    *   **Intent:** A ballot written with "Walag Nalog" (where "Walag" was a rectified attempt to write Nalog) is valid as it manifests the voter's intent [5].
    *   **Crossed-out Votes:** A vote for "N. Nalog" that was crossed out signifies a change of heart and is not counted [4].
    *   **Marked Ballots:** A ballot with "NALOG" printed on a sticker pasted on the ballot is marked and void under Section 149(14) of R.A. No. 180 [6].
    *   **Factual Issues:** Claims regarding fingerprints, smudges, and handwriting by two persons are questions of fact which the Supreme Court cannot review in this proceeding [7-9].

    After deducting nine (9) votes from Nalog (due to being stray, crossed-out, or marked with a sticker), his total was reduced to 2,039 votes. As De Guzman had 2,038 votes, Nalog retained a plurality of one (1) vote.

    **Decision affirmed.**
