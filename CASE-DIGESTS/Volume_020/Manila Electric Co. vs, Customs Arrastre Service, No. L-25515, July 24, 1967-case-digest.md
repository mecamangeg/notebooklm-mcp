I. CAPTION
MANILA ELECTRIC COMPANY v. CUSTOMS ARRASTRE SERVICE, BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, and REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-25515, July 24, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On March 3, 1963, the SS "Japan Bear" arrived in Manila and discharged a shipment consigned to Manila Electric Company (Meralco) into the custody of the Customs Arrastre Service, which is operated by the Bureau of Customs. The shipment consisted of valve charts and 128 cartons of electric street light controls and spicing tape [1]. Of this shipment, two cartons of electric street light controls valued at P1,873.98 were lost and not delivered [1].

Meralco filed a complaint in the City Court of Manila against the Customs Arrastre Service, the Bureau of Customs, and the Republic of the Philippines, obtaining a favorable judgment [2]. The defendants appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila and moved to dismiss based on the state's non-suability [2]. On November 4, 1965, the CFI dismissed the case, ruling that the Arrastre Service and Bureau of Customs are mere agencies of the Republic and cannot be sued [3]. Meralco appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Republic may be sued for its operation of the arrastre service [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Customs Arrastre Service, Bureau of Customs, and the Republic of the Philippines may be sued for acts committed in the operation of the arrastre service.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Bureau of Customs, as part of the government machinery, operates the arrastre service as an incident of a prime governmental function [3, 4]. Consequently, it is immune from suit [5]. This immunity extends to the Republic of the Philippines [3]. The Court relied on the doctrine established in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service and Bureau of Customs* (G.R. No. L-23129, December 17, 1966) [3].

The decision appealed from is affirmed. Petition dismissed [6].
