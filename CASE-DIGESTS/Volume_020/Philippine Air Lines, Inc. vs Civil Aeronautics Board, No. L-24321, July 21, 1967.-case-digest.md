I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE AIR LINES, INC. v. CIVIL AERONAUTICS BOARD and JACOB S. LIM, G.R. No. L-24321, July 21, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Jacob S. Lim (operator of Southern Air Lines) filed an application with the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to increase his equipment by four DC-3 aircraft. While hearings were pending, Lim filed an application for provisional authority to operate said aircraft. Petitioner Philippine Air Lines (PAL) opposed this application. The CAB initially deferred action and required Lim to submit project studies and proof of funding. A conference was scheduled to discuss the financial feasibility, with notice given to all airlines, but PAL failed to send a representative. On February 4, 1965, after a hearing where the profitability and rural service plans were discussed, the CAB approved Lim's application for provisional authority.

PAL moved for reconsideration, which was denied. PAL then filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, claiming the CAB resolution was void for lack of due process. PAL argued that the CAB failed to hear evidence, lacked factual basis for the grant, and failed to disclose supporting documents, invoking the doctrine in *Ang Tibay v. Court of Industrial Relations*. Respondents argued that the CAB order was interlocutory and thus not appealable.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the remedy of certiorari is available against an interlocutory order of the Civil Aeronautics Board.
2. W/N the CAB violated due process in granting the provisional authority to Lim.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The availability of the special civil action of certiorari against administrative agencies exercising judicial functions, like the CAB, is beyond dispute when they act without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion. This rule renders irrelevant the question of whether the order is interlocutory or not. The Court noted that the judiciary need no longer operate as a "barely tolerated intruder" in administrative processes when legitimate interests in legality are at stake.

2. **NO.** The Court held that the CAB did not violate procedural due process. The record showed the CAB was not precipitate in its approval; it required the submission of project studies and a notarized loan commitment of P1,000,000.00. Furthermore, conferences and hearings were held with prior notice to existing airlines, including PAL, to discuss profitability and feasibility. PAL failed to attend the conference despite notice. Under Section 10(C)(1) of Republic Act No. 776, the CAB has specific power to issue or revoke temporary operating permits "upon petition or complaint or upon its own initiative." The burden of showing essential unfairness rests on the party claiming injustice, and PAL failed to discharge this burden.

Petition denied.
