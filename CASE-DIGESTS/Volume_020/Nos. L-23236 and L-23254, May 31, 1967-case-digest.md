I. CAPTION
CENTRAL AZUCARERA DON PEDRO v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS and COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. Nos. L-23236 and L-23254, May 31, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Central Azucarera Don Pedro, a domestic corporation, filed its income tax returns for the fiscal years ending August 31, 1954 through 1958. Years later, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed deficiency income taxes against the petitioner. In the assessments made after June 20, 1959, the CIR imposed ½% monthly interest on the deficiency taxes pursuant to Section 51(d) of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 2343, which took effect on said date [1, 2]. The interest was computed starting from June 20, 1959, not from the date the original taxes were due [3].

Petitioner paid the deficiency taxes but protested the imposition of interest, arguing that applying the interest provision of R.A. 2343 to income earned *prior* to the amendment's effectivity constituted an invalid retroactive application and violated the prohibition against *ex post facto* laws [4, 5]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) upheld the CIR's ruling in both cases, holding that the law was not applied retroactively because the assessments were made after the law took effect and interest was charged only from the date of effectivity [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the interest on deficiency income tax prescribed in Section 51(d) of the Tax Code, as amended by R.A. 2343, applies to income earned prior to the law's effectivity.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA decisions, ruling that Section 51(d), as amended, expressly provides that interest on deficiency shall be assessed at the same time as the deficiency income tax [7]. Since the deficiency taxes were assessed and remained unpaid when R.A. 2343 was already in force, and the interest was computed only from the date of the law's effectivity (June 20, 1959) rather than from the original due date of the tax, the law was not applied retroactively [7, 8].

The Court further held that the constitutional prohibition against *ex post facto* laws applies only to criminal or penal matters, not to civil matters affecting private rights [9]. The collection of interest on taxes is not penal but compensatory, representing just compensation to the State for the delay in payment and the taxpayer's use of government funds [10]. Additionally, the proviso in Section 13 of R.A. 2343 regarding the application of new tax rates does not limit the applicability of the interest provision in Section 51(d) [9].

Decisions affirmed [11].
