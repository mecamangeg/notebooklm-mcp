I. CAPTION
FAUSTO MIPALAR v. HON. JOSE M. SANTOS, EUGENIO SAGUN, SOTERO FERNANDEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22966, August 10, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On January 28, 1963, petitioner-landowner Fausto Mipalar filed a petition in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) for the mechanization of a 45-hectare riceland in Nueva Ecija against fourteen tenants. Mipalar alleged he had served written notices to the tenants regarding his intention to cultivate the land mechanically, which they received between January 28, 1961, and February 23, 1961. He also filed a notice with the CAR on December 28, 1960. The respondents-tenants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the petition was filed beyond the reglementary period of two years required by law. The CAR sustained the motion and dismissed the case. Mipalar appealed, arguing for a liberal interpretation where the period should be counted from the later notice.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for dispossession was properly dismissed for failure to comply with the statutory notice period regarding the notice to the Court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. Under Section 50(a) of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended, a landowner must file a notice with the court *and* inform the tenant in writing "at least one year but not more than two years prior to the date of his petition." The Court held that this statute mandates that **both** notices must be made within the specified period.

In this case, while the notices to the tenants were within the two-year period, the notice to the CAR was filed on December 28, 1960—two years and one month before the petition was filed on January 28, 1963. The Court rejected Mipalar's argument to count the period from the later notice (the notice to tenants). Citing Section 56 of R.A. 1199, the Court ruled that doubts must be resolved in favor of the tenant. Allowing the two-year limitation to run from the later notice would extend the period a landlord has to ask for dispossession, which is unfavorable to the tenant. Thus, strict compliance with the substantive requirements of the notice period for both the court and the tenant is necessary.

The dismissal order is affirmed.
