I. CAPTION
ASUNCION CONUI-OMEGA v. CESAR SAMSON, G.R. No. L-22821, August 15, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., Acting C.J.

II. FACTS
Asuncion Conui-Omega was declared the winner in an election protest against Cesar Samson by the Supreme Court in a previous decision (G.R. No. L-21910), with costs imposed on Samson [1]. Upon remand to the Court of First Instance of Leyte for execution, Conui-Omega submitted a bill of costs totaling P1,236.10. However, the Clerk of Court taxed only P346.10 against Samson. Conui-Omega appealed to the lower court, seeking to include P400.00 for a copy of the transcript of stenographic notes and P300.00 for the printing of her brief [1]. The lower court sustained her appeal and ordered Samson to pay these additional items. Samson appealed to the Supreme Court after his motion for reconsideration was denied [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the prevailing party in an election protest may recover the costs for the transcript of stenographic notes and the printing of the appeal brief from the losing party [2].

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's orders. Citing Section 11(d), Rule 131 of the old Rules of Court (substantially reproduced in Section 11(d), Rule 142 of the Revised Rules of Court), the Court held that "no allowance shall be made to the prevailing party in the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals for the brief or written or printed arguments of his attorney, or copies thereof," aside from a nominal sum of thirty or fifty pesos [2, 3]. Because the Election Code is silent on this point, the Rules of Court apply in a suppletory character [3]. Furthermore, the Court ruled that the payment for a copy of the transcript was not indispensable, as Conui-Omega could have utilized the original transcript attached to the records [4]. The cost of the printed brief redounded to her sole benefit and is not recoverable absent a finding that the contest was filed in bad faith or without justification [4]. The orders appealed from were reversed, and the original taxation of costs by the Clerk was approved [5].
