I. CAPTION
JUANA LAUREL-MANILA, ET AL. v. DIONISIO GALVAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23507, May 24, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Mariano K. Laurel died in 1921. In 1925, the probate court authorized the administrator, Procopio Laurel, to sell a parcel of land *a retro* to spouses Dionisio Galvan and Carmen Cabrera for P23,000.00, redeemable within seven years [1], [2]. The heirs failed to redeem the property, leading the Galvans to consolidate ownership and obtain a Transfer Certificate of Title in 1932 [3]. The Galvans possessed the property openly and adversely from 1925 onwards [3]. On September 16, 1954—29 years after the sale—Mariano’s successors-in-interest (petitioners) filed a complaint for *reivindicacion*, arguing the sale was void for non-compliance with the Code of Civil Procedure or was merely an equitable mortgage [4]. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription, though it declared the sale void. It also denied the defendants' counterclaim for moral damages [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioners' action to recover the property is barred by laches or prescription.
2. W/N the defendants are entitled to moral damages.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The unexplained interval of 29 years (1925–1954) constitutes laches, placing petitioners in estoppel to question the validity of the probate court's order and the subsequent sale [6]. Furthermore, under the Code of Civil Procedure (Act No. 190), which was the law in force when the cause of action accrued in 1925, the maximum prescriptive period for bringing actions was 10 years [7]. The petitioners' inaction lasted almost three times the statutory period [7]. The 30-year extraordinary prescription period under the New Civil Code does not apply, as Article 1116 provides that prescription already running before the Code's effectivity shall be governed by laws previously in force [8], [9].

2. **NO.** There was no grave abuse of discretion in refusing to award moral damages. The amount was not proven, and the petitioners' complaint was based on an honest mistake in the interpretation of applicable law [10]. It is not sound public policy to penalize the right to litigate absent proof of bad faith [10].

**Decision affirmed.**
