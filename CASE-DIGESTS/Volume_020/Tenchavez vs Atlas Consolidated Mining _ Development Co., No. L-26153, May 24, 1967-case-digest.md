I. CAPTION
GUALBERTO TENCHAVEZ v. ATLAS CONSOLIDATED MINING & DEVELOPMENT CO., ET AL., G.R. No. L-26153, May 24, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Gualberto Tenchavez filed a complaint against Atlas Consolidated Mining and other defendants (Civil Case No. R-4848) in the Court of First Instance of Cebu. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court. Pending appeal, the parties filed a joint petition for judgment based on a Compromise Agreement dated April 12, 1967. Under the agreement, Tenchavez received P100,000.00 in full settlement of his claims. He waived his rights regarding the assets of Toledo Mining Co., Inc. and acknowledged the validity of their transfer to Atlas. The agreement expressly novated and superseded the lower court's judgment. Initially, Tenchavez's counsel opposed the compromise, alleging fraud and collusion to deprive them of attorney's fees, but they later withdrew their motion and opposition after receiving their fees and expressing satisfaction with the arrangement.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Compromise Agreement should be approved.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court approved the Compromise Agreement and rendered judgment in accordance with its terms, ordering the parties to comply with the stipulations therein. The Court noted that the opposition filed by the appellant's counsel regarding their attorney's lien had been withdrawn following the settlement of their fees. As there were no further objections, the agreement was deemed valid to settle the litigation.

The petition for judgment in accordance with the Compromise Agreement is granted.
