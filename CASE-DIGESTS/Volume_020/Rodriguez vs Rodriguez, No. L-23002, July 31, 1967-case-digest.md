I. CAPTION
CONCEPCION FELIX VDA. DE RODRIGUEZ v. GERONIMO RODRIGUEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23002, July 31, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Concepcion Felix was the registered owner of two fishponds in Bulacan. In 1929, she contracted a second marriage with Domingo Rodriguez. In 1934, Petitioner executed a deed of sale conveying the fishponds to her daughter from a previous marriage, who, days later, sold the same properties back to Petitioner and her husband Domingo, thereby converting the paraphernal properties into conjugal assets [1, 2].

Domingo died in 1953. Petitioner and the respondents (Domingo’s children and grandchildren from a prior marriage) executed an Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate, dividing the fishponds as conjugal property. Petitioner subsequently executed other documents, including a deed of partition and a lease agreement over the properties [3-5].

In 1962, Petitioner filed a complaint to nullify the 1934 transfers, alleging that her consent was obtained through duress, that the contracts were simulated and lacked consideration, and that the transfers were merely a scheme to circumvent the prohibition against donations between spouses. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of respondents [6-8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 1934 contracts should be annulled on the ground of duress.
2. W/N the contracts are void ab initio for being simulated or for lack of consideration.
3. W/N the Petitioner can recover the properties based on the nullity of the transfer for violating the prohibition against donations between spouses.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The charge of duress must be treated with caution, especially when the person allegedly employing it is already dead. Furthermore, duress is merely a vice of consent which makes a contract voidable, not void. Under Article 1301 of the Civil Code of 1889, the action to annul based on duress must be brought within four years after it has ceased. Since the action was filed 28 years after the alleged intimidation and 9 years after the husband's death, the action has prescribed [9, 10].

2. **NO.** The contracts were not simulated because the parties actually intended to produce legal effects—specifically, to convert the paraphernal property into conjugal property. To achieve this, the transfers had to be real and effective [11]. Regarding consideration, the deeds recited specific prices (P2,500 and P3,000). Under Article 1274 of the Civil Code of 1889, the promise to pay is sufficient *causa* or consideration; the alleged non-payment of the price does not make the contract inexistent [12, 13].

3. **NO.** While the transfers were indeed executed to circumvent the prohibition against donations between spouses (Article 1334, Civil Code of 1889), this illicit purpose constituted an *illegal causa*. Because both parties were aware of and participated in the illegal scheme, the rule of *in pari delicto non oritur actio* applies (Articles 1305 and 1306, Civil Code of 1889). As Petitioner was as guilty as her husband in attempting to evade the law, she is denied all recovery. Additionally, her action is barred by laches and estoppel due to her delay of 28 years and her subsequent acts recognizing the validity of the transfers [14-16].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [17].
