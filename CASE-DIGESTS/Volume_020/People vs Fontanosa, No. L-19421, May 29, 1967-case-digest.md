I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AGRIPINO FONTANOSA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19421, May 29, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Romulo Ramos leased public forest land in *sitio* Daeg, Bansalan, Davao, converting it into a ranch. On December 13, 1957, at around 10:00 PM, the appellants (Crispulo Gilvero, Silverio Cañete, Aquilino Bacang, Genovevo Barro, Mauro Bacang, Alfredo Cabardo, Martin Cabardo, Macario Matas, and Celso Lape), armed with rifles and acting on the inducement of Agripino Fontanosa due to a land conflict, attacked Ranch House No. 2 [1], [2], [3]. The attack resulted in the death of Danilo Doneza, a cowhand [4].

During the investigation, the appellants executed extrajudicial confessions admitting their participation [5]. However, during trial, they retracted these statements, claiming they were procured through maltreatment and torture by the Philippine Constabulary [6]. They also interposed the defense of alibi and challenged the jurisdiction of the Davao court, arguing the crime occurred in Cotabato [7], [8]. The Court of First Instance of Davao acquitted Fontanosa but convicted the appellants of murder qualified by treachery, sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua* [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance of Davao had jurisdiction over the case.
2. W/N the extrajudicial confessions of the appellants were admissible.
3. W/N the appellants’ defense of alibi and lack of *corpus delicti* is meritorious.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Pasture Land Lease Agreement and the attached sketch clearly placed the ranch in Bansalan, Davao [8]. Under Section 38, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, entries in official records of the Bureau of Forestry are *prima facie* evidence of the facts stated therein. In the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, these entries are accepted as conclusive [8].

2. **YES.** The claim of maltreatment was belied by the evidence. The medical certificates presented by appellants showed only superficial wounds or complaints of pain, and their counsel failed to request immediate medical examinations despite allegedly seeing injuries days after the arrest [10], [11]. Furthermore, the Fiscal and witnesses testified that the appellants voluntarily signed and thumb-marked their affidavits, and the confessions contained details that only the perpetrators would know [12], [13].

3. **NO.** Alibi is a weak defense as it is easy to fabricate [14]. It cannot prevail over the extrajudicial confessions which were corroborated by other evidence, such as the recovery of the rifles used [15]. Regarding *corpus delicti*, the fact of death constitutes the *corpus delicti* in murder; this was established by the autopsy and testimonies confirming Doneza died of a gunshot wound [16].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [17].
