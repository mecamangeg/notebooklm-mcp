**I. CAPTION**
**THE PHILIPPINE AMERICAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY vs. SOCIAL SECURITY COMMISSION**, G.R. No. L-20383, May 24, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
On November 6, 1960, the Social Security System (SSS) issued Circular No. 34, approved by the Chairman of the Social Security Commission (SSC), requiring insurance firms to register their agents and solicitors as employees for compulsory coverage. The SSS subsequently demanded that the Philippine American Life Insurance Company (Philam Life) submit data on its agents and pay premiums. Philam Life objected, arguing its agents were not employees. Instead of appealing the SSS demand to the Commission, Philam Life filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to restrain the SSC from collecting contributions or prosecuting its officers. The CFI ruled in favor of Philam Life, declaring the agents were not employees and enjoining the SSC. The SSC appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to issue a writ of prohibition against the Social Security Commission.
2. W/N Philam Life observed the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** A writ of prohibition may only be issued by a superior court to an inferior court or body. Under Section 5(a) of the Social Security Act (R.A. No. 1161), the Commission is vested with the power to determine and settle claims, a quasi-judicial function. In the exercise of these powers, the Commission is not inferior to the Court of First Instance, much like the Public Service Commission. Consequently, the CFI lacked jurisdiction to issue the writ against the Commission. Decisions of the Commission in its quasi-judicial capacity are reviewable only by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, as provided by Section 5(c) of the Act.

2. **NO.** Section 5(b) of the Social Security Act explicitly states that judicial review is permitted only after the aggrieved party has exhausted its remedies before the Commission. The Circular approved by the Chairman did not constitute a "decision" of the Commission on a controversy, as no controversy existed at the time of its issuance. Philam Life should have first submitted its objection to the Commission for determination before seeking judicial intervention. Having failed to appeal to the Commission or seek reconsideration, Philam Life had no cause of action for prohibition.

**Decision reversed; complaint dismissed.**
