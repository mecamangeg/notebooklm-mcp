**I. CAPTION**
PEDRO GRAVADOR v. EUTIQUIO MAMIGO, THE DISTRICT SUPERVISOR OF BAYAWAN STA. CATALINA SCHOOL DISTRICT, et al., G.R. No. L-24989, July 21, 1967, 20 SCRA 743, Castro, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Pedro Gravador, a public school principal, was separated from service on August 15, 1964, by respondent school officials who alleged he had reached the compulsory retirement age of 65. Respondents relied on pre-war school records (Insular Teacher’s Cards) showing Gravador was born on November 26, 1897. Gravador protested, asserting he was born on December 11, 1901, based on post-war records, his own testimony, and affidavits from neighbors. He also pointed to the fact that his elder brother, Constantino, was born in 1898.

Gravador filed a protest with the Director of Public Schools but received no immediate decision. After waiting eight months, he filed a petition for *quo warranto*, mandamus, and damages with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Oriental on April 13, 1965. Respondents argued that the administrative finding of age was binding and that the petition was premature due to failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The CFI ruled in favor of Gravador, ordering his reinstatement. Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the post-war records and evidence establishing Petitioner's age as December 11, 1901, should prevail over the administrative finding based on pre-war records.
2. W/N the petition for *quo warranto* was barred by the failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court held that the lower court correctly relied on the post-war records and evidence. While factual findings of administrative officials are generally binding, they must be supported by substantial evidence. Here, the pre-war records were outweighed by three factors: (a) **Family Tradition:** A person may testify as to his age as learned from parents and relatives (Rule 130); (b) **Declaration *ante litem motam*:** A 1924 verified pleading by Petitioner’s deceased brother, Romulo, stating Petitioner’s age was admissible as a declaration regarding pedigree made before the controversy arose (Rule 130, Sec. 33); and (c) **Circumstantial Evidence:** It was established that Petitioner’s *elder* brother was born in 1898; thus, it was physically impossible for Petitioner to have been born in 1897.

2. **NO.** The rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies is not absolute and does not apply where insistence on its observance would result in the nullification of the claim. An action for *quo warranto* to recover a public office must be brought within one year. Petitioner had already waited eight months for the administrative officials to act on his protest. To require him to wait further would have left him with insufficient time to file suit before the one-year prescriptive period expired.

The judgment *a quo* is affirmed.
