I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LORENZO JARAVATA @ ENSO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22029, August 15, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On December 23, 1958, Aurelio Flores, a truck driver, was shot to death inside the compound of Carried Lumber Co. in Dagupan City [1]. The killing was the result of a conspiracy masterminded by appellant Lorenzo Jaravata, a union head, who held a grudge against Flores for causing trouble within the union [2, 3]. State witness Raymundo Muñoz testified that Jaravata hired him and others to kill Flores [2]. The plan involved Clemente Dadoya (contact man), Gregorio Muñoz (triggerman), Segundo Santos (who trained Gregorio to use the gun), and Rafael Fernandez (who provided a knife) [4, 5]. On the night of the crime, the assailants hid behind a pile of logs in the dark and Gregorio shot Flores from behind [6]. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan convicted the accused of murder and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua* [7]. Jaravata, Santos, and Fernandez appealed, challenging the credibility of the state witness and their liability [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the testimony of the state witness Raymundo Muñoz is credible.
2. W/N a conspiracy existed rendering the appellants liable as co-principals.
3. W/N the crime committed is murder qualified by treachery.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court found no reason to disturb the trial court's findings giving credence to Raymundo Muñoz's testimony [8]. The credibility of witnesses is best determined by the trial judge (*People v. Evaristo*; *People v. Lumayag*) [8]. Furthermore, Raymundo's testimony was corroborated by other prosecution witnesses, including the victim's wife and a co-worker [9].

2. **YES.** The proof of conspiracy was established beyond reasonable doubt [9]. Jaravata was the mastermind; Santos trained the triggerman; and Fernandez provided a weapon for the mission [9, 10]. Where conspiracy is proven, all conspirators are liable as co-principals [10, 11].

3. **YES.** Treachery attended the commission of the offense because the assailants hid behind a pile of logs under cover of darkness and shot the victim from behind as he turned around [10]. Treachery absorbed the circumstance of nighttime/nocturnity [10]. Additionally, evident premeditation was present as the accused repeatedly plotted the murder over several weeks [10]. Either circumstance suffices to qualify the crime to murder [10].

The judgment of the lower court sentencing appellants to *reclusion perpetua* and ordering them to indemnify the heirs is AFFIRMED [12].
