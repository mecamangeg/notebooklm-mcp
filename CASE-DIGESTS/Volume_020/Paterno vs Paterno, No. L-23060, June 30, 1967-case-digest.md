I. CAPTION
BEATRIZ PATERNO, ET AL. v. JACOBA T. PATERNO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23060, June 30, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-minors Beatriz and Bernardo Paterno, represented by their mother Feliza Orijuela, claimed to be the illegitimate children of Dr. Jose P. Paterno, who died intestate on April 17, 1956. On April 18, 1958, they filed a complaint in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court (JDRC) of Manila against the deceased’s widow and legitimate children (Defendants). Plaintiffs alleged continuous possession of the status of illegitimate children and sought: (1) compulsory recognition; (2) nullification of the Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate executed by defendants on June 26, 1956; (3) delivery of their hereditary shares; and (4) P20,000 in actual damages plus support.

Previously, plaintiffs had filed a similar case in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, which was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the primary issue was paternity. The JDRC likewise dismissed the new complaint, ruling that the action was essentially for the recovery of hereditary shares (partition) cognizable by the ordinary courts, with paternity being merely incidental. The JDRC held that the issue of paternity should be resolved in the probate court to avoid splitting the cause of action. Plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court (JDRC) has jurisdiction over the action for compulsory recognition.
2. W/N the separate filing of actions for filiation and partition violates the rule against splitting a cause of action.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the JDRC has jurisdiction to determine the issue of paternity. Under Articles 287 and 887 of the Civil Code, an illegitimate child must be recognized to inherit. Since the complaint alleged continuous possession of status—a ground for compulsory recognition under Article 283—the main action is for the establishment of filiation, which falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the JDRC. However, the JDRC does not have jurisdiction over the partition of the estate or claims for damages, which are cognizable by the Court of First Instance. The "incidental powers" granted to the JDRC under R.A. 1401 do not extend to subject matters within the jurisdiction of ordinary courts.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that there is no violation of the rule against splitting a cause of action (Sec. 3, Rule 2, Revised Rules of Court). While the rule prohibits instituting more than one suit for a single cause of action, the creation of the JDRC with exclusive jurisdiction over paternity separated the claims. Recognition of children and recovery of hereditary shares can no longer be joined in one suit as they lie within the jurisdiction of different tribunals.

The order of dismissal was **SET ASIDE** insofar as it affects the issue of paternity, and the case was returned to the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court for the determination of that particular issue.
