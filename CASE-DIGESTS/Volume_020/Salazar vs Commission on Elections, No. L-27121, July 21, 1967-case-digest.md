I. CAPTION
JOSE OSCAR M. SALAZAR, et al. v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, et al., G.R. No. L-27121, July 21, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were appointed by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) as "Election Registrars in the Commission on Elections" on various dates in 1964. These appointments did not specify a particular station. Subsequently, they were detailed to various municipalities in the province of Aklan. In December 1966, pursuant to Republic Act No. 4730, which required election registrars to be appointed to specific municipalities, the COMELEC appointed the private respondents as permanent election registrars for the municipalities where the petitioners were previously detailed. The petitioners were instead appointed as permanent registrars for other municipalities. Asserting a violation of their security of tenure, petitioners filed an original action with the Supreme Court to nullify the new appointments of the respondents, arguing that their prior assignment confirmed their permanency in those stations.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners are entitled to security of tenure in the specific municipalities to which they were assigned, precluding their transfer or replacement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition and dissolved the preliminary injunction. The Court held that election registrars are entitled only to such security of tenure as their appointment papers actually confer. Since the petitioners' appointments did not state any particular station, they cannot assert security of tenure regarding the mere assignments or details given to them. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Ibañez v. Commission on Elections* (G.R. No. L-26558), emphasizing the distinct demarcation between "appointment" and "assignment" in the law of public officers. As their appointments were general, their assignment to specific municipalities was temporary and did not grant them a vested right to those specific offices.

The petition is dismissed.
