I. CAPTION
POLICARPIO VIRAY, ET AL. v. CITY OF CALOOCAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23118, July 26, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On September 18, 1962, the Municipal Board of Caloocan City enacted Ordinance No. 94, series of 1962, which imposed an "entrance fee" (P10.00 for adults, P5.00 for children) on cadavers coming from outside the city sought to be buried in private cemeteries within Caloocan [1, 2]. Plaintiffs Viray, Cajote, and Prieto, residents of Manila, paid these fees to the City Treasurer for the burial of their relatives in La Loma Cemetery [3, 4]. They subsequently demanded a refund, arguing the ordinance was *ultra vires* and a revenue-raising measure beyond the city's authority [3, 5]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissed their complaint and upheld the ordinance [3]. The plaintiffs appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Ordinance No. 94, imposing fees on cadavers coming from outside the city for burial in private cemeteries, is valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision.

First, the Court ruled that the fee is not authorized by the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. 2264). While the Act empowers cities to tax "persons engaged in any occupation or business, or exercising privileges," the burial of a cadaver is a solitary act and does not constitute an occupation, business, or the exercise of a privilege subject to taxation [6].

Second, the ordinance cannot be justified under the Police Power. The City argued the fee covered the cost of police traffic regulation during funeral processions [7]. The Court held that traffic regulation is required for all funerals, regardless of where the cadaver comes from or whether the burial is in a public or private cemetery. Imposing the fee only on cadavers from *outside* Caloocan buried in *private* cemeteries constitutes unjustifiable discrimination and violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution [8].

Finally, the Court noted that the ordinance technically described a "transfer fee" for exhumed bodies, yet "entrance fees" were collected for fresh burials, further proving the imposition was unauthorized [9].

The decision appealed from is REVERSED and the questioned portion of Ordinance No. 94 is declared *ultra vires* and void [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando, JJ., concurred [10].
