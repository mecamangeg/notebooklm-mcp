I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, in its capacity as judicial administrator of the intestate estate of the late Macauyag (Moro) v. SEGUNDO FERNANDEZ, G.R. No. L-20086, July 10, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On September 13, 1958, PNB filed a complaint against Fernandez to recover P10,000.00 based on a promissory note dated February 16, 1948 [1]. Fernandez moved to dismiss based on prescription, which the trial court denied [2]. PNB then moved to declare Fernandez in default, but the court denied this on November 8, 1958 [2]. Fernandez subsequently filed his answer on November 12, 1958 [3]. However, PNB filed an *ex-parte* motion for reconsideration, pointing out that Fernandez’s earlier motion for extension was filed five days after the reglementary period expired [3]. The court granted the reconsideration on November 19, 1958, declared Fernandez in default, and later rendered judgment in favor of PNB [3, 4]. Fernandez filed a petition for relief from judgment, arguing that he was not in default when PNB filed its *ex-parte* motion and thus was entitled to notice [4, 5]. The trial court denied the petition, prompting the appeal [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the denial of the petition for relief from judgment was proper despite the alleged procedural error in declaring the defendant in default.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order denying the petition for relief. While the Court conceded that Fernandez was technically not in default when he filed his answer due to the standing November 8 order, the decisive factor in a petition for relief from judgment is the existence of a **meritorious defense** [6, 7].

The Rules require such petitions to be accompanied by an affidavit of merits to determine if setting aside the judgment would serve any purpose [7]. Upon reviewing Fernandez's answer, the Court found his only defense was prescription [7]. However, the answer admitted that he received written demands for payment from PNB before the ten-year period expired [7]. Under **Article 1155 of the Civil Code**, the prescription of actions is interrupted by written extrajudicial demands by the creditor [7]. Since Fernandez had no meritorious defense, granting relief would be pointless [7].

The order appealed from is affirmed [8].
