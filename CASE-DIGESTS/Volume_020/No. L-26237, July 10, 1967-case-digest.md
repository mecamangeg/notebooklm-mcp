I. CAPTION
NORTH BRITISH & MERCANTILE INSURANCE CO., LTD. v. ISTHMIAN LINES, INC., INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER MACLEOD, INC., REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and/or BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-26237, July 10, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On July 31, 1963, 61 packages of medicine were shipped from New York to Manila aboard the SS "Steel Recorder," operated by Isthmian Lines, Inc. [1]. Upon arrival, 59 packages were delivered to the consignee, Squibb-Mathieson International Corporation, but two packages were overcarried to Singapore and subsequently re-shipped to Manila [1, 2]. These two packages were delivered to the Customs Arrastre Service but were never delivered to the consignee [2].

North British & Mercantile Insurance Co., Ltd., the cargo insurer, paid the consignee's claim of P4,474.71 and was subrogated to its rights [2]. It filed a suit for damages against Isthmian Lines and the Republic of the Philippines and/or Bureau of Customs in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [2]. Isthmian Lines settled amicably, leaving the Republic and the Bureau of Customs as the sole defendants [3]. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that the Republic cannot be sued without its consent and the Bureau of Customs has no capacity to be sued [3]. North British appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Republic of the Philippines and/or the Bureau of Customs may be sued for damages arising from their operation of the arrastre service.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. The Court held that the Bureau of Customs, acting as an arrastre operator, is an instrumentality of the national government [4]. Relying on the doctrine in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service* (G.R. No. L-23139), the Court ruled that the Bureau is immune from suit for damages, regardless of the merits of the claims, for obvious reasons of public policy [4].

Accordingly, the judgment appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [5].
