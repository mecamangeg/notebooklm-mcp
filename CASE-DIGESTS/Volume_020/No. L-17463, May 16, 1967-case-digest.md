I. CAPTION
TEODORO SUMALJAG BONGAL with his guardian ad litem and natural mother, SEVERINA SUMALJAG v. BARBARA P. VDA. DE BONGAL, G.R. No. L-17463, May 16, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Teodoro Bongal, a minor assisted by his mother Severina Sumaljag, filed an action for acknowledgment (compulsory recognition), partition, and damages against Respondent Barbara P. Vda. de Bongal, the surviving spouse of the late Zosimo Bongal. Teodoro alleged he was the natural child of Zosimo and Severina, born during their cohabitation (1938-1940) when both were free to marry [1]. Zosimo subsequently married Barbara and died intestate in 1959 [1].

Respondent moved to dismiss, arguing the action was barred by a prior judgment in a 1955 adoption proceeding (Sp. Proc. No. 111-0) where Zosimo and Barbara adopted one Rustico Bongal [2]. Respondent contended that under Art. 335 of the Civil Code, a person with an acknowledged natural child cannot adopt; therefore, the decree of adoption conclusively established that Zosimo had no such child, and Petitioner was estopped for failing to oppose the adoption [3]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the case on the ground of bar by prior judgment [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for compulsory recognition is barred by the final judgment in the prior adoption proceedings.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the action was not barred. The Court reasoned that at the time of the adoption proceedings, the Petitioner did not yet have the status of an acknowledged natural child, but was merely seeking *compulsory* recognition in the present case [6, 7]. Thus, the prohibition in Art. 335 of the Civil Code—which disqualifies those with acknowledged natural children from adopting—did not apply as an impediment to the adoption of Rustico [7]. Consequently, Petitioner had no personality to contest the adoption at that time and could not be bound by its judgment [7].

The Court ruled that the adoption of a third party does not deprive a child of the right to seek recognition as a natural child upon competent evidence [7]. Furthermore, the Court noted that even if a child were voluntarily acknowledged, such status is permanent and cannot be lost simply because the father subsequently adopts another person [8].

The Order of dismissal is set aside, and the case is remanded to the lower court for trial on the merits [9].
