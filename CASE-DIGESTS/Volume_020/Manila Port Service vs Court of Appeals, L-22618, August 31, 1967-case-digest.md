I. CAPTION
MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. COURT OF APPEALS and NORTHWEST INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-22618, August 31, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On July 25, 1960, Smith Bell & Co. shipped spare parts consigned to J.C.A. Lumber and General Merchandise, insured by respondent Northwest Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. [1]. Upon arrival on September 4, 1960, the cargo was received by petitioner Manila Port Service (MPS), the arrastre operator under a Management Contract with the Bureau of Customs [2]. The consignee’s broker obtained a delivery permit but could not locate the cargo; thus, no gate pass was issued, and MPS certified the shipment as not delivered [2].

Northwest Insurance paid the consignee the insurance proceeds of P5,514.83 and, as subrogee, filed a claim against MPS [3, 4]. MPS refused to pay, arguing that the consignee was bound by the Management Contract, which limited liability and set periods for filing claims [5]. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Northwest Insurance, which the Court of Appeals affirmed [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the consignee and its subrogee are bound by the provisions of the Management Contract between the arrastre operator and the Bureau of Customs.

IV. RULING
**NO.** A contract generally binds only the parties to it [6]. While jurisprudence allows the Management Contract to bind consignees via estoppel, this only applies when the consignee avails of the benefits of the contract by taking delivery of goods using a permit or gate pass stamped with the contract's terms [6].

In this case, the consignee did not derive any benefit from the Management Contract because there was no delivery, partial or total, as the goods were lost [7]. No gate pass was issued or used [7]. The Court applied the doctrine in *Shell Company of the Philippines, Ltd. vs. Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas*, holding that sheer notice of the contract provisions is insufficient to bind a consignee who does not make use of a delivery permit to withdraw goods [8, 9].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED** [10].
