I. CAPTION
BACHRACH TRANSPORTATION COMPANY, INC. v. RURAL TRANSIT SHOP EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION, ET AL., G.R. No. L-26764, July 25, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On April 19, 1964, the respondent Union went on strike. On May 19, 1964, the President of the Philippines certified the dispute to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) pursuant to Section 10 of the Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act No. 875), docketed as Case 48-IPA. The CIR issued a return-to-work order and restrained the petitioner Company from dismissing employees without court authority. Subsequently, the petitioner began suspending, dismissing, and transferring employees to provincial shops. The Union filed an incidental motion complaining of these acts. On September 8, 1966, the CIR issued an order enjoining the petitioner from transferring employees during the pendency of the main case without court authority, to prevent further deterioration of employer-employee relations. The petitioner appealed, arguing that the CIR lacked jurisdiction to issue the injunction without a finding of unfair labor practice and failed to comply with the requirements of Section 9(d) of RA 875 regarding injunctions in labor disputes.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR has jurisdiction to enjoin employee transfers in a labor dispute certified by the President, even without a finding of unfair labor practice.
2. W/N the issuance of an injunction under Section 10 of the Industrial Peace Act requires compliance with the strict requisites of Section 9(d) of the same Act.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The CIR has broad discretion to find a solution to a labor dispute certified by the President under Section 10 of RA 875. The power to issue an order enjoining transfers is ancillary to the empiric process of compulsory arbitration and is intended to prevent further deterioration of the relationship between the parties pending the resolution of the main case. The Court held that jurisdiction in certified cases involving national interest is totally independent of jurisdiction in unfair labor practice cases; thus, a finding of unfair labor practice is not necessary for the CIR to grant injunctive relief in a certified case [1, 2].

2. **NO.** Sections 9(d) and 10 of RA 875 are separate and distinct legal precepts. Section 9(d) applies to ordinary labor disputes involving "unlawful acts" such as violence or breaches of the peace, while Section 10 deals exclusively with disputes in industries indispensable to the national interest [3, 4]. The Court ruled that requiring compliance with Section 9(d) for Section 10 injunctions would violently curtail the CIR's power to create a favorable climate for resolving national interest disputes. The overriding consideration under Section 10 is the national interest, and the CIR may exercise its powers thereunder independent of the conditions in Section 9(d) [5, 6].

The orders of the Court of Industrial Relations are affirmed.
