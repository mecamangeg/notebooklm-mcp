I. CAPTION
**IN RE: PETITION FOR CONSOLIDATION OF TITLE IN THE VENDEES OF A HOUSE AND THE RIGHTS TO A LOT. MARIA BAUTISTA VDA. DE REYES, ET AL. v. MARTIN DE LEON**, G.R. No. L-22331, June 6, 1967, 20 SCRA 369, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Rodolfo Lanuza and his wife Belen owned a house on a leased lot in Tondo, Manila. On January 12, 1961, Rodolfo executed a "Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase" conveying the house, leasehold rights, and appliances to Maria Bautista Vda. de Reyes and Aurelia Navarro (petitioners) for P3,000, with a three-month redemption period. The deed stipulated that failure to repurchase would automatically vest ownership in the vendees without court intervention. Belen did not sign the original deed but later signed an annotation extending the redemption period.

Subsequently, on October 4, 1961, the Lanuzas mortgaged the same house to Martin De Leon (intervenor-appellant) to secure a P2,720 loan. De Leon registered this mortgage under Act No. 3344. Upon Lanuza's failure to pay, De Leon foreclosed the mortgage, purchased the house at the sheriff's sale, and took possession. Meanwhile, Reyes and Navarro filed a petition for consolidation of ownership after the redemption period expired. De Leon intervened, claiming preference as a registered mortgagee.

The trial court ruled in favor of Reyes and Navarro, holding that the sale was validly ratified by the wife and that an unrecorded prior sale prevails over a subsequent recorded mortgage. De Leon appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the sale by the husband without the wife's consent was valid.
2. W/N the contract labeled "Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase" was actually an equitable mortgage.
3. W/N the unrecorded "Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase" is preferred over the subsequent registered mortgage.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A conveyance of conjugal real property by the husband without the wife's consent is merely voidable under Article 173 of the Civil Code. It is susceptible to ratification. In this case, the wife ratified the contract when she signed the annotation extending the redemption period [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The contract is an equitable mortgage, not a true sale. The Court inferred this from several circumstances: (a) Gross inadequacy of price (P3,000 for a house, leasehold rights, and appliances); (b) The stipulation that ownership would "automatically pass" upon failure to pay is a *pactum commissorium*, which is void under Article 2088 and indicates an intention to mortgage; (c) The vendor remained in possession; and (d) Delay in filing the petition for consolidation [3-6].

3. **NO.** Since the contract was an equitable mortgage and not a sale, ownership did not pass to Reyes and Navarro. Consequently, the rule that a prior unrecorded sale is preferred does not apply. Instead, the conflict is between an unrecorded equitable mortgage (Reyes/Navarro) and a subsequent registered mortgage (De Leon). Under Article 2125 and Article 2242(5) of the Civil Code, preference is determined by priority of registration (*prior tempore, potior jure*). De Leon's registered mortgage is preferred over the unrecorded equitable mortgage [7].

**Decision reversed.**
