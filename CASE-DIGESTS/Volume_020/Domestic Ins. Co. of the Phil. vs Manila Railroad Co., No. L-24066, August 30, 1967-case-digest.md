I. CAPTION
DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and its subsidiary MANILA PORT SERVICE, G.R. No. L-24066, August 30, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Domestic Insurance Company of the Philippines, as insurer and subrogee of various consignees, filed a complaint against the Manila Railroad Company and the Manila Port Service (arrastre operator) to recover the value of goods short-delivered or damaged in three separate shipments. The parties stipulated that under Section 15 of the Management Contract, the arrastre operator's liability is conditioned on the filing of a claim within 15 days from the date of the discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel.

1.  **First Cause of Action:** Cargo was discharged on February 8, 1960. A provisional claim was filed on February 19, 1960.
2.  **Second Cause of Action:** Cargo was discharged on May 11, 1960. A provisional claim was filed on May 19, 1960.
3.  **Third Cause of Action:** The carrying vessel arrived on February 24, 1960, and cargo was discharged on February 26, 1960. However, the provisional claim was dated February 22, 1960, and filed on February 25, 1960—one day before the actual discharge.

The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the plaintiff for all three causes of action. The defendants appealed, questioning whether the provisional claims constituted substantial compliance with the Management Contract.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the provisional claims filed by the plaintiff constituted substantial compliance with the 15-day filing requirement under Section 15 of the Management Contract.

IV. RULING
**YES, as to the First and Second Causes of Action; NO, as to the Third Cause of Action.**

For the first two causes of action, the Court held that filing a provisional claim within 15 days from the date of discharge of the last package is substantial compliance with the Management Contract [1]. The fact that the provisional claim did not specify the value of the loss does not negate compliance, as held in *State Bonding & Insurance Co. v. Manila Port Service* [1].

However, for the Third Cause of Action, the Court ruled that the claim was "premature and speculative" because it was filed *before* the date of discharge of the last package [2]. Citing *New Hampshire Fire Insurance Co. v. Manila Port Service*, the Court distinguished that a claim filed before discharge may only be valid if the consignee had already discovered or was informed of the shortage or damage [2]. In this case, the provisional claim was prepared on February 22 (before the vessel even arrived on February 24) and filed on February 25 (before the discharge on February 26) [3]. This "stereo-type" claim showed it was impossible for the consignee to have known of the loss at the time of filing [3]. The subsequent formal claim filed on July 12, 1960, could not cure the defect as it was beyond the 15-day period [4].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision appealed from is modified, eliminating the award under the Third Cause of Action, but affirmed with respect to the First and Second Causes of Action.
