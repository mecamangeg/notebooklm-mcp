I. CAPTION
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY v. ROBERTA RONGAVILLA and the WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-21963, August 30, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Roberta Rongavilla was employed by the National Development Company (NDC) as a pirm winder from 1946 until her separation from service on June 11, 1951, due to pulmonary tuberculosis. Her work involved strenuous physical exertion, standing for long periods, and rotating shifts that included night work. She was diagnosed with minimal TB in October 1950; despite rest, the lesions progressed to a moderately advanced stage by March 1951.

On May 31, 1960, nearly nine years after her separation, Rongavilla filed a claim for disability compensation. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded her compensation, ruling that her illness was caused or aggravated by the nature of her employment. NDC appealed, arguing that: (1) TB and "aggravation" were not compensable grounds under the law at the time of her illness (prior to Republic Act No. 772 which took effect in 1952); and (2) the WCC lacked jurisdiction because the claim was filed beyond the period prescribed in Section 24 of Act 3428.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Rongavilla's tuberculosis is compensable despite being contracted before Republic Act No. 772 explicitly inserted "tuberculosis" and "aggravation" into the Workmen's Compensation Act.
2. W/N the claim is barred by the employee's failure to file the notice and claim within the period prescribed by Section 24 of Act 3428.
3. W/N the action to recover compensation has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Even before the effectivity of Republic Act No. 772 on June 20, 1952, Section 2 of Act 3428 already provided that an employee is entitled to compensation for *any* illness "directly caused by such employment, or the result of the nature of such employment." The Court held that the subsequent insertion of the word "tuberculosis" and the phrase "aggravated by" was merely for clarification and did not change the import of the original law (*Blue Bar Coconut Company v. Boo*). Since the WCC found that Rongavilla's illness was caused or accelerated by the strenuous nature of her work (night shifts and physical exertion), she is entitled to compensation.

2. **NO.** The failure of the employee to comply with the notice and filing requirements of Section 24 is non-jurisdictional. Delay or failure to give notice does not bar the claim if the employer had knowledge of the illness or did not suffer by such delay. NDC had knowledge of Rongavilla's condition as early as 1950 through its physician but failed to file the required report or manifest its intention to controvert the claim within the period prescribed by Section 45 of Act 3428. This failure constitutes a renunciation of the employer's right to controvert the claim (*Manila Railroad Company v. WCC*).

3. **NO.** The liability of an employer to pay compensation is an obligation created by law. Under Article 1144(2) of the Civil Code, actions to enforce such obligations prescribe in ten (10) years from the time the right of action accrues. Since Rongavilla filed her claim roughly nine years after her disability commenced, the action was filed within the prescriptive period.

Petition dismissed; decision affirmed.
