**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE'S SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY, INC. v. HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS and RAFAEL V. GUZMAN, G.R. No. L-21627, June 29, 1967, 20 SCRA 482, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
In a case before the Court of Appeals (CA), Rosario Yulo obtained a writ of preliminary injunction against respondent Rafael Guzman upon posting a P2,000 bond subscribed by petitioner People's Surety & Insurance Co., Inc. (Surety). Pending the case, Guzman claimed damages resulting from the injunction. The CA received evidence on the claim without notifying the Surety. On February 5, 1962, the CA rendered a decision dissolving the injunction and holding Yulo and the Surety solidarily liable for damages [1]. This decision became final and executory on May 30, 1962 [1]. After a writ of execution against Yulo was returned unsatisfied, the CA issued an alias writ against the Surety [2]. Realizing the Surety was not notified, the CA suspended its orders and allowed Guzman to file a new application for damages against the Surety to cure the defect, despite the judgment having long become final [3]. The Surety filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition, arguing the CA lost jurisdiction.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to entertain a proceeding for damages against the surety on an injunction bond after the judgment against the principal has become final and executory.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that a court has no jurisdiction to entertain any proceeding seeking to hold a surety liable on its injunction bond where the surety was not given notice of the proceedings against the principal and the judgment holding the latter liable has already become final [4].

First, a judgment against a surety issued without notice is void for lack of due process [5]. Second, pursuant to Section 20 of Rule 59 (now Rule 57), the application for damages and notice to the sureties must be filed "before the trial" or, at the latest, "before entry of the final judgment" [6]. This requirement is jurisdictional and mandatory to allow the award against the sureties to be included in the final judgment, thereby avoiding multiplicity of suits [4]. Allowing such a proceeding after entry of judgment would divest the judgment of the character of finality it had already acquired [4].

Petition granted; the decision of the Court of Appeals and its subsequent orders are annulled insofar as the Surety is concerned [7].
