I. CAPTION
POBLETE CONSTRUCTION CO. v. ASIAIN, G.R. No. L-21448, August 30, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Miguel Asiain was an employee of Poblete Construction Company from 1956 until his death on November 22, 1959. Although he had accomplished his SSS Form E-1 (Employees' Date Record) and submitted it to the company, the company never filed it with the Social Security System (SSS). The company claimed Miguel refused to have his share of monthly contributions deducted from his salary. Upon his death, his widow, Judith Asiain, filed a petition with the Social Security Commission (SSC) to recover benefits. The company moved to dismiss, arguing that since Miguel was not a reported member of the System, the SSC had no jurisdiction and the claim for "damages" under Section 24 of the Social Security Act belonged to the regular courts. The SSC denied the motion, declared the company in default, and awarded P3,600.00 equivalent to death benefits. The case was certified to the Supreme Court on appeal. [1-5]

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Social Security Commission has jurisdiction to award damages under Section 24 of the Social Security Act even if the employer failed to report the employee to the System. [5, 6]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Social Security Commission has jurisdiction. Coverage in the System is compulsory, and under Section 24 of the Social Security Act, it is the mandatory duty of the employer to report the employee immediately. This duty does not depend on the employee's willingness to provide his share of the contribution; thus, the employee's refusal to have deductions made does not excuse the employer's failure to report. If the employer fails to report and the employee dies, the employer is liable for the amount equivalent to the benefits the employee would have received. Although Section 24 refers to this liability as "damages," Section 5(a) of the Act vests the Commission with authority over the "filing, determination and settlement of claims." The Court held that the term "claims" is broad enough to include claims for damages under Section 24. To rule otherwise would allow employers to nullify the Commission's jurisdiction simply by failing to report their employees.

Decision affirmed. [6-8]
