**I. CAPTION**
**ESTEBAN MORANO, CHAN SAU WAH and FU YAN FUN v. HON. MARTINIANO VIVO**, G.R. No. L-22196, June 30, 1967, 20 SCRA 562, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Chan Sau Wah, a Chinese citizen, arrived in the Philippines on November 23, 1961, as a temporary visitor with her minor son, Fu Yan Fun, posting a P4,000.00 cash bond. On January 24, 1962, she married Esteban Morano, a natural-born Filipino citizen, and they had a son. After their authorized stay and extensions expired on September 10, 1962, the Commissioner of Immigration ordered them to leave, warning of arrest and bond confiscation. Instead of departing, they filed a petition for Mandamus and Prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI ruled that Chan Sau Wah became a Filipino citizen upon marriage and enjoined her deportation, but dismissed the petition regarding her son Fu Yan Fun and authorized the forfeiture of their bond. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N an alien woman married to a Filipino citizen *ipso facto* becomes a Filipino citizen.
2. W/N Section 37(a) of the Immigration Act, empowering the Commissioner to issue warrants of arrest, is unconstitutional for violating the Bill of Rights.
3. W/N a temporary visitor may change their status to permanent resident without first departing the country.
4. W/N a foreign-born stepchild follows the citizenship of the Filipino stepfather.
5. W/N the immigration bond is void for lack of approval by the Secretary of Justice.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** Under Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization Law (C.A. 473), marriage to a Filipino does not automatically confer citizenship. The alien woman must prove she "might herself be lawfully naturalized," meaning she possesses all qualifications and none of the disqualifications required by law. Since petitioners admitted Chan Sau Wah lacked the requisite qualifications, she did not become a Filipino citizen [1-5].

2. **NO.** Section 37(a) is constitutional. The constitutional guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures (requiring a judge to determine probable cause) applies to criminal prosecutions, not administrative deportation proceedings. The power to deport is an attribute of sovereignty, and the Commissioner's warrant is incidental to this administrative power [6-14].

3. **NO.** Under Sections 9 and 13 of the Immigration Act, a non-immigrant cannot convert their status to permanent resident without voluntarily departing to a foreign country and procuring a new visa from a Philippine consul. Marriage to a citizen does not exempt an alien from these requirements, which are intended to discourage entry under false pretenses [15-20].

4. **NO.** The term "child" in Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization Law and Article IV of the Constitution refers to a legitimate child, not a stepchild. Thus, Fu Yan Fun did not acquire Philippine citizenship through his stepfather [21, 22].

5. **NO.** The requirement for the Secretary of Justice's approval of the bond form is merely directory. Furthermore, equitable considerations estop the petitioners from questioning the bond's validity after they used it to enter the country and benefited from it [23-26].

**WHEREFORE**, the judgment regarding Chan Sau Wah is **REVERSED** (petition denied), and the judgment is **AFFIRMED** in all other respects (deportation of Fu Yan Fun and bond forfeiture).

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
**Dizon, J.**, concurred in the result, noting specifically that the petitioners admitted Chan Sau Wah did not possess all qualifications required by the Naturalization Law [27].
