**I. CAPTION**
**ATLAS DEVELOPMENT AND ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION v. HON. BENJAMIN M. GOZON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21588, July 31, 1967, 20 SCRA 886, Makalintal, J.**

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Atlas Development and Acceptance Corporation (Atlas) located and recorded three mineral claims in Antipolo, Rizal and filed lease applications [1]. Respondents Carsec Mining Association (Carsec), Pasig Mining Association (Pasig), and Manuel J.C. Reyes protested, alleging conflicts with their own claims. The Director of Mines ruled in favor of Carsec and Pasig, a decision affirmed by respondent Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources (SANR) [2].

Disputing the rulings, Atlas filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal against the respondents under Section 61 of the Mining Act (Commonwealth Act No. 137), praying that the administrative decisions be set aside [2, 3]. Carsec filed a cross-claim against Pasig. Pasig moved to dismiss, arguing the petition failed to state a cause of action because it did not comply with the formalities of an appeal nor the requirements of a petition for *certiorari*. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that an independent civil action is not authorized to resolve mining conflicts and that Atlas failed to perfect a proper appeal or file a valid *certiorari* petition [4, 5]. The CFI also dismissed Carsec’s cross-claim. Atlas and Carsec appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the remedy under Section 61 of the Mining Act constitutes a special civil action for *certiorari* or an ordinary appeal requiring Rule 40 formalities.
2. W/N the petition filed by Atlas is a valid mode of judicial review sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** Section 61 of the Mining Act does not contemplate a special civil action for *certiorari* under Rule 65, which is available only when there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy. The statute expressly allows the matter to be taken to court, ruling out *certiorari* [7]. Furthermore, Section 61 does not contemplate an appeal subject to the formalities of Rule 40 (appeals from inferior courts), such as trial *de novo* or appeal bonds, as the statute would have been explicit if such specific procedures were intended [8, 9]. Nor is it an ordinary original civil action triable without regard to the administrative decisions [10].

2. **YES.** What is implicit in Section 61 is a **review of an administrative decision** [10]. While the statute does not specify the precise procedure, a petition pointing out errors and asking for decisions to be set aside is sufficient for judicial cognizance [10, 11]. The Court held that judicial review of administrative decisions is subject to guideposts: findings of fact are respected if supported by substantial evidence, but review is justified in cases of denial of due process, mistake of law, fraud, collusion, or arbitrary action [11].

However, the dismissal of Carsec's cross-claim was affirmed because Carsec failed to appeal the SANR decision within the statutory period, rendering it final and binding against them [12].

**Disposition:** The order of dismissal is **SET ASIDE** regarding Atlas’s petition and the case is **REMANDED** for further proceedings. The dismissal of Carsec’s cross-claim is **AFFIRMED** [13].
