I. CAPTION
EMILIANO ACUÑA v. BATAC PRODUCERS COOPERATIVE MARKETING ASSOCIATION, INC., et al., G.R. No. L-20333, June 30, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Emiliano Acuña entered into a tentative agreement with the Manager of defendant Batac Producers Cooperative Marketing Association, Inc. (Batac Procoma) to advance P20,000.00 for tobacco operations and serve as its Manila representative. The Board of Directors authorized the Manager to execute the contract [1]. A formal agreement was executed on May 10, 1962. Acuña advanced the P20,000.00, provided 3,000 sacks, and advanced an additional P5,000.00, allegedly with the Board's knowledge and acquiescence [2]. After the corporation collected P381,495.00 from the PVTA using Acuña's assistance, the Board passed a resolution on June 6, 1962, disapproving and rescinding the agreement [3].

Acuña filed a complaint for specific performance and damages. Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground that the complaint stated no cause of action, arguing the contract was never perfected due to lack of Board approval and was void *ab initio* because it involved illegal "upgrading" of tobacco [4]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissed the complaint, ruling the contract void and stating no cause of action existed [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the complaint states a cause of action despite the alleged lack of formal Board approval.
2. W/N the lower court properly dismissed the complaint based on the defense of illegality raised in the defendants' motion and affidavits.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** When a Motion to Dismiss is based on lack of cause of action, the averments in the complaint are deemed hypothetically admitted, and the inquiry is limited to whether those allegations make out a case for relief [6], [7]. The complaint contained sufficient allegations indicating ratification of the contract by the Board, specifically through the acceptance and retention of benefits (the cash advances and sacks) [8], [9]. Ratification may be implied by silence, acquiescence, or acceptance of benefits [10]. Furthermore, the Board's resolution to "rescind" the contract implies its existence, as one cannot rescind a non-existent contract [11].

2. **NO.** The sufficiency of a Motion to Dismiss must be tested solely on the allegations of the complaint [12], [7]. Affidavits submitted with the motion can only be considered to determine if an issue of fact exists, not to resolve the factual issue itself [13], [14]. The lower court erred in ruling the contract void *ab initio* based on the defendants' interpretation of "upgrading" tobacco as illegal. Acuña provided a counter-affidavit explaining "upgrading" as a legitimate reclassification process [15], [16]. Whether the term had an illegal connotation is a question of fact that must be resolved after a trial on the merits, not summarily in a Motion to Dismiss [17].

The Order of dismissal is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED to the lower court for further proceedings [18], [19].
