**I. CAPTION**
TY ENG HUA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20897, May 30, 1967, 20 SCRA 89, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Ty Eng Hua, a citizen of Nationalist China, filed a petition for naturalization on March 28, 1961, with the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur [1, 2]. He has a wife and four minor children to support [3]. In his petition, he averred that he derived an annual income of P3,600.00 as a merchant, although his 1960 income tax return showed a net income of P4,739.32 [3]. He further testified that he could earn around P6,000.00 for the year 1961 [3]. The trial court granted the petition, declaring him eligible for citizenship [2]. The Republic appealed the decision, arguing that the petitioner lacked a lucrative income [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Ty Eng Hua has a lucrative income sufficient to qualify for naturalization.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that for purposes of naturalization, income is reckoned as of the time of the filing of the application [3]. In this case, the application was filed in March 1961 [3]. Neither the petitioner's averred income of P3,600.00 nor his tax return showing P4,739.32 is considered a "lucrative income" for an individual with a wife and four minor children to support [3]. Even assuming he earned P6,000.00 in 1961, this amount still fails to meet the standard required by the Naturalization Law [3].

Accordingly, the judgment is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DENIED** [4].
