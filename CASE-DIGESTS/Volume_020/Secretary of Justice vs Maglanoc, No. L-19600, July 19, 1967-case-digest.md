I. CAPTION
SECRETARY OF JUSTICE, PROVINCIAL FISCAL OF QUEZON, and SPECIAL PROSECUTOR VICENTE ORENDAIN, JR. v. THE HON. JUDGE ENRIQUE MAGLANOC, FILEMON JUNTEREAL, ELENO M. JOYAS, FIDEL FARAON, JESUS OROZCO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19600, July 19, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Judge Maglanoc rendered a decision in a cadastral case adjudicating a 15,000-hectare lot to Leon Faraon [1]. However, Faraon later executed a sworn statement denying he was the claimant or that he participated in the proceeding [2]. Consequently, the Secretary of Justice issued Administrative Order No. 300 designating special prosecutors, including petitioner Orendain, to assist the Provincial Fiscal in prosecuting court personnel (private respondents) for falsification and other offenses related to the decision [2, 3]. When Orendain started the investigation, respondents filed a petition for prohibition before Judge Maglanoc, arguing that the special prosecutor could not investigate without the Provincial Fiscal's presence and that a prejudicial question existed due to a pending petition by the Director of Forestry to reopen the cadastral case [3-5]. Judge Maglanoc issued a preliminary injunction restraining the investigation [4]. Petitioners filed this certiorari action to set aside the injunction [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the special prosecutor may conduct the investigation without the presence or consent of the Provincial Fiscal.
2. W/N the pending petition to reopen the cadastral case constitutes a prejudicial question warranting the suspension of the criminal investigation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The special prosecutor acts with authority. The designation to "assist" the Provincial Fiscal does not imply that the Fiscal must be present at every stage of the investigation [6]. Citing *People v. Henderson*, the Court held that a lawyer appointed by the Secretary of Justice under Section 1686 of the Revised Administrative Code is authorized to sign informations, make investigations, and conduct prosecutions without securing the consent of the corresponding Fiscal [6]. If consent is not required, the Fiscal's physical presence is likewise not indispensable, otherwise the purpose of the designation could be defeated by an uncooperative Fiscal [6].

2. **NO.** The pending reopening of the cadastral case is not a prejudicial question [5]. The issue in the reopening is the alleged fraud and misrepresentation by the land claimant, Leon Faraon, which does not involve the specific criminal participation of the respondent court employees [5]. Any judgment rendered in the cadastral case will not be conclusive as to the guilt or innocence of the respondents regarding the falsification charges [5, 7].

The petition is granted, and the writ of preliminary injunction is set aside [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred; Chief Justice Concepcion and Justice Dizon took no part) [8].
