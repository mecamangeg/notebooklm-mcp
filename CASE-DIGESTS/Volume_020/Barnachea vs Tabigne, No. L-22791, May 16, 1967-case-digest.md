I. CAPTION
CIRILO BARNACHEA, PAULINO GONZALES, BERNARDO GONZALES and RICARDO GOROSPE v. HON. EMILIANO C. TABIGNE and SIN HAP LEE & Co., G.R. No. L-22791, May 16, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners filed a complaint (Case 1260-V) in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against respondent Sin Hap Lee & Co. for wage differentials and overtime pay covering the years 1956 to 1959. The trial judge, Judge Bautista, initially rendered a decision granting the claim for overtime pay. However, upon respondent's motion for reconsideration, the CIR *en banc* reversed the decision and dismissed the case for lack of substantial evidence.

The CIR *en banc* found that the overtime work was recorded in time records and payrolls, which the petitioners admitted signing without compulsion. These documents indicated that the extra services had been paid. Petitioners contested this with oral testimony, alleging irregularities such as signing blank payrolls or not noticing entries. The CIR *en banc* gave credence to the documentary evidence over the conflicting oral testimonies. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court by certiorari.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the findings of fact of the Court of Industrial Relations *en banc*, relying on documentary evidence over conflicting oral testimony, should be disturbed by the Supreme Court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR *en banc* resolution, holding that in reviewing decisions of the Court of Industrial Relations, the Court is not guided by the rule of preponderance of evidence but by the rule of **substantial evidence**.

The Court found that the time records and payrolls constituted substantial evidence supporting the conclusion that overtime had been paid [1]. The Court applied the doctrine that where there is a conflict between oral and documentary evidence, and the lower court gives credence to the documentary evidence, such factual findings should not be disturbed if supported by substantial evidence (*Norton & Harrison Company vs. Norton & Harrison Co.*, *National Fastener Corporation vs. CIR*) [1].

Decision affirmed.
