I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LORENZO PORTUGUEZA @ ENSOY, G.R. No. L-22604, July 31, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On July 27, 1963, in Barrio Cabatuan, Palapag, Samar, Francisco Balicuas was attacked by Florentino Gapole and the appellant, Lorenzo Portugueza [1]. Gapole struck the first blow, almost severing the victim's left arm, which proved to be a fatal injury [1, 2]. Portugueza followed, inflicting a superficial incised wound on the victim's left flank [1, 2]. The victim died the following day [2]. The incident was witnessed by Ana Taringting, and the victim identified both accused as his assailants in an *ante-mortem* statement [3].

Gapole pleaded guilty to Murder and was convicted [4]. Portugueza pleaded not guilty but was found guilty of Murder by the Court of First Instance of Samar, which ruled there was conspiracy and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* [4]. Portugueza appealed, contending that conspiracy was not proven and his liability should be individual [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N there was conspiracy between the appellant and his co-accused to commit murder.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that conspiracy must be proven as clearly and convincingly as the commission of the crime itself [5]. Although the accused were brothers-in-law and acted with some degree of simultaneity, these facts alone do not prove conspiracy where their meeting with the victim was purely casual [5, 6].

Liability is individual in the absence of conspiracy. Gapole's infliction of the mortal wound demonstrated an intent to kill, while Portugueza’s infliction of a mere scratch—which would require only ten days of medical attendance—did not indicate a unity of purpose or a shared "criminal resolution" to kill the victim [6]. Consequently, Portugueza is liable only for the consequences of his own specific acts [6].

The decision appealed from is **MODIFIED**. Appellant Lorenzo Portugueza is found guilty only of **Less Serious Physical Injuries** and sentenced to six (6) months of *arresto mayor* [7]. Having been detained longer than the imposed penalty, his immediate release was ordered [7].
