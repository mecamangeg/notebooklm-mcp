I. CAPTION
TEOFILO YAP v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-23656, May 15, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Teofilo Yap filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga City. The notice of the petition was published in the "Clarion," which the lower court determined to be a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Zamboanga. To support his petition, Yap presented two character witnesses: Leticia C. Alvarez, his former elementary teacher, and Catalino C. Pantaleon, a shop superintendent at the Bureau of Public Highways. The trial court granted the petition. The Solicitor General appealed, challenging the sufficiency of the publication and the qualifications of the character witnesses [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the publication of the petition in the "Clarion" was sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the trial court.
2. W/N the character witnesses presented were "credible persons" within the meaning of the Naturalization Law.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A naturalization case is a proceeding *in rem*, requiring publication for the court to acquire jurisdiction over the whole world. Section 9 of the Naturalization Law mandates publication in the Official Gazette and a newspaper of general circulation in the *province* where the petitioner resides. The "Clarion" was only of general circulation in the *City* of Zamboanga, which does not meet the statutory requirement. The purpose of publication is to apprise people in the province who know the petitioner so they may submit relevant data to the authorities. Without proper publication, the lower court did not acquire jurisdiction, rendering the decision void [3-5].

2. **NO.** Section 7 of the Naturalization Law requires affidavits from two "credible persons." This term refers to individuals with a high degree of reputation for honesty and integrity in the community, whose word can be taken as a warranty of the petitioner's worthiness. Witnesses essentially act as "insurers" of the applicant's character (*Ong v. Republic*). While Yap's witnesses (a teacher and a shop superintendent) held respectable positions, the record failed to show they possessed the specific high standing and reputation required by law to vouch for the petitioner [6, 7].

The decision is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DISMISSED** [8].
