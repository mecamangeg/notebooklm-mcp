I. CAPTION
EDILBERTO BALANE, et al. v. PASTOR L. DE GUZMAN and FRANCISCO QUINTELA, G.R. No. L-21281, May 24, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Francisco Quintela filed a petition in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) against landowners Oliva Bustos and Jesus Ma. Bernarte, claiming he was the tenant-overseer of their lands, had planted coconut trees thereon, and was unlawfully ejected [1, 2]. He sought reinstatement and compensation [2]. The landowners denied his claims [2]. Subsequently, petitioners Balane et al. filed a motion for intervention, alleging they were the only *bona fide* tenants of the land and the ones who actually planted the trees [2]. Respondent Judge De Guzman denied the intervention, stating petitioners had no "inchoate interest" in the litigation [3]. After their motion for reconsideration was denied, petitioners filed a petition for mandamus with the Supreme Court to compel the Judge to allow them to intervene [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the petitioners' motion for intervention.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that while the allowance of a motion to intervene generally rests within the sound discretion of the court, such discretion is not unlimited [4, 5]. Under the Rules, the court must consider whether the intervention will unduly delay the adjudication or if the intervenor's rights can be fully protected in a separate proceeding [4].

Here, the Court found there would be no undue delay as the motion was filed before the trial and only two days after the answer was filed [6]. Moreover, the petitioners' rights could not be fully protected in a separate proceeding because a decision declaring Quintela as the tenant of *all* the lands would necessarily and injuriously affect the petitioners' "material, direct and immediate" interest [7]. Denying intervention would also expose the landowners to the danger of paying compensation twice [7, 8]. Consequently, the denial was an arbitrary exercise of discretion correctible by mandamus [4].

The writ is granted, and respondent Judge is ordered to allow the intervention of petitioners [8].
