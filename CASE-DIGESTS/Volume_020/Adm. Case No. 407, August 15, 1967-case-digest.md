**I. CAPTION**
IN RE: ATTORNEY JOSE AVANCENA, respondent, Adm. Case No. 407, August 15, 1967, Angeles, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Jose Avanceña, a member of the Bar, was convicted of falsification of public document under Art. 172 of the Revised Penal Code in Criminal Case No. 10220 (*People v. Avanceña*) before the Court of First Instance of Manila [1, 2]. The trial court found that he took advantage of his legal profession to falsify a Power of Attorney and the signatures of the Jao brothers to defraud his clients [3, 4]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, and the Supreme Court dismissed his petition for review [5]. Avanceña was committed to prison in January 1963 but was granted a conditional pardon by the President in September 1963 and subsequently discharged [3, 5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the respondent should be disbarred despite the conditional pardon granted by the President.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that the conviction for falsification of a public document involves moral turpitude [6, 7]. The respondent's acts constituted deceit, malpractice, and gross misconduct in office under Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court [7]. The Court held that the conditional pardon extended by the Chief Executive is of no moment; it merely relieved the respondent of the penal consequences of his act but does not operate as a bar to his disbarment for professional misconduct [8]. Citing *In re Lontok*, the Court emphasized that he is being disbarred for his conduct as an attorney, not merely for the conviction [8].

Accordingly, judgment was entered declaring Jose Avanceña disbarred from the practice of law and striking his name from the roll of attorneys [8].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, and Fernando, JJ. concurred [9].
