I. CAPTION
PACIFICO M. BRAGANZA v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, THE COMMISSIONER OF CIVIL SERVICE and BENJAMIN ABELLA, G.R. No. L-27017, August 15, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On November 2, 1964, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) extended provisional appointments to petitioner Pacifico M. Braganza and respondent Benjamin Abella as "Election Registrars" without designating any specific official station. Both were subsequently directed via telegram to report to Mabini, Pangasinan, where they qualified and assumed duty. On August 20, 1965, Braganza was designated Officer-in-Charge of the Mabini office.

However, on September 7, 1966, COMELEC appointed Abella as the *permanent* Election Registrar for Mabini, Pangasinan. Abella qualified and assumed the permanent post on November 8, 1966. Braganza moved for reconsideration, claiming he had acquired a vested right to the permanent position and security of tenure in Mabini, arguing his initial provisional appointment was irregular and should be treated as permanent. When his motion failed, he filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner Braganza acquired a vested right to the office of permanent Election Registrar of Mabini, Pangasinan, entitling him to security of tenure.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the petition.

The Court held that a provisional appointment without a specific station does not entitle the appointee to a permanent appointment for the town to which they are merely assigned. If the petitioner's claim that his initial appointment was void due to irregularity were accepted, a void appointment confers no rights other than those under the *de facto* doctrine [1].

Furthermore, reiterating the ruling in *Ibañez v. Commission on Elections* (G.R. No. L-26558), the Court distinguished between appointment and assignment. Security of tenure applies only to the office to which one is appointed, not the station to which one is merely detailed or assigned [2]. Since Braganza's appointment did not specify Mabini, Pangasinan, his subsequent assignment there via telegram did not grant him a permanent right to that specific station.

Finally, the power to appoint is discretionary. COMELEC has the right to determine who is best qualified for the permanent position. The "Guidelines" cited by Braganza were intended for assignments, not to control the Commission's discretion in making permanent appointments [3, 4].

**Disposition:** Petition denied.
