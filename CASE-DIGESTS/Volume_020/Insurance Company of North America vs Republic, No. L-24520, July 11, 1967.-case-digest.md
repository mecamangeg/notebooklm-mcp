I. CAPTION
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and/or BUREAU OF CUSTOMS and/or CUSTOMS ARRASTRE SERVICE, G.R. No. L-24520, July 11, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On May 20, 1963, a shipment of tools consigned to Dayton Price & Co., Ltd. arrived on the SS "Turandot" and was delivered to the Customs Arrastre Service of the Bureau of Customs [1]. Part of the shipment, valued at P3,261.21, was lost [2]. The petitioner, as the insurer who paid the claim, filed a suit for recovery in the City Court of Manila against the Republic, the Bureau of Customs, and the Customs Arrastre Service [2]. The City Court ruled in favor of the petitioner. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint on March 3, 1965, ruling that the defendant government agencies had no juridical capacity to be sued and that the money claim should have been filed with the Auditor General [2, 3]. The petitioner appealed directly to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Bureau of Customs and Customs Arrastre Service are immune from suit for acts performed in their arrastre operations.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Bureau of Customs, in operating the arrastre service, acts as part of the governmental machinery in the performance of a prime governmental function and is indispensable to the collection of taxes and duties. Consequently, it is immune from suit [3]. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Mobil Phil. Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service* (G.R. No. L-23139), holding that the proper remedy for a money claim against the government is to file it with the Auditor General under Commonwealth Act No. 327 [3].

The order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED** [4].
