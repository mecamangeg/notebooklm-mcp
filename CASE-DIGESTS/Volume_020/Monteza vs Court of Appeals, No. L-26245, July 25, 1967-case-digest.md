**I. CAPTION**
**PABLO MONTEZA v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS and ULDARICO REYES**, G.R. No. L-26245, July 25, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
In the November 12, 1963 general elections, Pablo Monteza and Uldarico Reyes contested the mayoralty of Caibiran, Leyte. The Municipal Board of Canvassers proclaimed Monteza the winner with 1,378 votes against Reyes' 1,367 votes [1, 2]. Reyes filed an election protest in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte, which ruled in his favor. Monteza appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the CFI decision but reduced Reyes' majority to eight votes (1,362 for Reyes vs. 1,354 for Monteza) [2]. Monteza petitioned the Supreme Court for review, alleging errors in the appreciation of ballots, specifically regarding marked ballots, *idem sonans*, and the validity of votes containing nicknames or prefixes [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N ballots containing repetitions of candidates' names are void as marked ballots.
2. W/N a group of ballots reflecting a similar voting pattern for top officials and using initials for councilors constitutes marked ballots.
3. W/N specific ballots containing "P. Matilaza," wrong given names, expressions of affection ("Minamahal"), or prefixes ("Mr.") are valid.
4. W/N the appellate court may *motu proprio* consider ballots not raised in the assignment of errors.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** Ballots with name repetitions (e.g., "Clemco Clemco") are void marked ballots. The Court found the voters were intelligent and the repetitions were not justified by mistake or necessity for clarification [3, 4]. Furthermore, evidence *aliunde* existed showing a party inspector checked a list of voters who allegedly sold votes whenever names were written twice [3].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that 12 ballots where the same candidates for lieutenant-governor, board member, and mayor were voted for did not sufficiently indicate a pattern of marking [5]. The use of initials for councilors is allowed in the absence of evidence *aliunde* that this was done for identification purposes. Mere coincidence in voting for the same top candidates is insufficient to invalidate ballots [5].

3. **YES.**
    *   **Idem Sonans:** A vote for "P. Matilaza" is valid for Pablo Monteza as "P" matches his initial and "Matilaza" is *idem sonans* with Monteza [6].
    *   **Wrong Given Name:** Votes for "Manuel Roxas" and "Antonio Climaco" (candidates were Gerardo Roxas and Cesar Climaco) are valid innocent errors, not marks [7].
    *   **Affection:** The use of "Minamahal" is an expression of affection and does not invalidate the ballot [8].
    *   **Prefixes/Nicknames:** The use of nicknames accompanied by surnames and the prefix "Mr." is permissible under election rules absent intent to identify [9].
    *   *Exception:* A ballot with "Montego" and "POEj" written upside-down was declared marked and invalid due to the anomaly [10].

4. **YES.** It is settled doctrine that an appellate court in election contests may consider ballots not taken up in an assignment of error. This power allows the court to ensure substantial justice is served and the will of the electorate and public interest are protected [11].

**Disposition:** The decision of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED**. Petitioner Pablo Monteza is declared the duly elected Mayor of Caibiran, Leyte [12].
