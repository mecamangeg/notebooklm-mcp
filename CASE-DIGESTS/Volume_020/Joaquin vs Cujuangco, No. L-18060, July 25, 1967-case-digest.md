I. CAPTION
REMIGIO JOAQUIN v. ISIDRA CUJUANGCO, et al., G.R. No. L-18060, July 25, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Remigio Joaquin, claiming to be the heir of Pedro Joaquin, filed an action in 1959 against defendants Isidra Cujuangco, et al., to recover four parcels of land [1, 2]. Plaintiff alleged that Parcels 1 and 2 were fraudulently registered by the administrators of Pedro Joaquin’s estate in 1921 and 1925, and subsequently transferred to defendants, who obtained Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) in 1928 and 1936, respectively [2-4]. Regarding Parcels 3 and 4, plaintiff alleged they were merely mortgaged to defendants to secure a loan, but defendants fraudulently secured a TCT via a deed of sale in 1913 [5, 6]. Plaintiff claimed he offered to redeem the mortgage in 1917, but defendants refused, asserting they had bought the land [5]. The Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija dismissed the complaint on the grounds that it failed to state a cause of action and was barred by the statute of limitations [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for reconveyance and recovery of ownership is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal [8].

Regarding Parcels 1 and 2, the Court ruled that while the original administrators may have held the land in trust, this fiduciary relation did not extend to the defendants, who acquired the land for value and claimed adverse title [9]. Defendants obtained TCTs in their names in 1928 and 1936 [10]. Under **Section 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure**, their adverse possession ripened into ownership by prescription after the lapse of ten years, barring the action filed in 1959 [10].

Regarding Parcels 3 and 4, although the plaintiff claimed the transaction was a mortgage, defendants had obtained a TCT by virtue of a deed of sale in 1913 [6]. When defendants refused plaintiff's offer to redeem in 1917 claiming ownership, their possession became adverse [11]. Consequently, the defendants' adverse possession ripened into dominical title by acquisitive prescription after ten years, barring the recovery action [11].
