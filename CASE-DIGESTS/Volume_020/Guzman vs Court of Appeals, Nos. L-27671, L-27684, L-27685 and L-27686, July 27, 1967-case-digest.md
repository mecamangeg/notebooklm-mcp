I. CAPTION
PABLO DE GUZMAN v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. Nos. L-27671, L-27684, L-27685, and L-27686, July 27, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pablo de Guzman was charged with five separate cases of theft of large cattle (carabaos) in the Justice of the Peace Court (JPC) of Angat, Bulacan. The JPC found him guilty in all cases [1]. He appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan, where he entered a plea of not guilty and submitted to a trial *de novo* without objecting to the court's jurisdiction. The CFI also convicted him in all five cases [1, 2].

On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) found that the five carabaos were taken from a common pasture, constituting a single criminal act of theft rather than five separate offenses [3]. The CA convicted him of one crime of theft of large cattle with a total value of P930.00. Petitioner then moved for reconsideration and appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the JPC lacked original jurisdiction because the total value (P930.00) exceeded its jurisdictional limit of P200.00 [4]. He contended that since the JPC had no jurisdiction, the CFI acquired no appellate jurisdiction, rendering the conviction void [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance acquired jurisdiction over the case despite the Justice of the Peace Court's lack of original jurisdiction.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment. While the Justice of the Peace Court lacked jurisdiction because the total value of the stolen property (P930.00) exceeded the P200.00 statutory limit [4], the defect was cured in the Court of First Instance.

The Court held that when a defendant is tried by an inferior court without jurisdiction and appeals to the CFI, two courses of action are available: (1) assail the appellate jurisdiction and seek dismissal, or (2) voluntarily submit to the CFI in the exercise of its original jurisdiction [2]. Since the petitioner submitted to the trial *de novo* in the CFI without objecting to its appellate jurisdiction, he is deemed to have submitted himself to the CFI's original jurisdiction [6].

The CFI had exclusive original jurisdiction over the theft of carabaos valued at P930.00 [7, 8]. Applying Section 11, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court and established jurisprudence (*U.S. v. Ang Suyco*), no error of jurisdictional dimensions existed because the CFI properly exercised its original jurisdiction [6, 8, 9]. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed and the CA judgment affirmed [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS (if any)
None. (Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred; Chief Justice Concepcion and Justice Dizon were on leave) [10].
