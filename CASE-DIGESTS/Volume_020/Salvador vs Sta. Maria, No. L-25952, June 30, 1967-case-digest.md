I. CAPTION
MARGARITA SALVADOR, et al. v. THE HON. JUDGE ANDRES STA. MARIA, et al., G.R. No. L-25952, June 30, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Celestino Salvador filed a suit for reconveyance of land against spouses Alfonso Salvador and Anatolia Halili, alleging a void sale. Celestino died during the pendency of the case and was substituted by 21 alleged heirs (Petitioners). Meanwhile, testate proceedings were instituted for his estate, and Dominador Cardenas was appointed executor.

The Court of Appeals rendered a final judgment in the reconveyance suit, ordering the properties returned specifically to the "21 heirs substituted as plaintiffs." Consequently, titles were issued in their names. One of the parcels (Lot 6) was sold for P41,184.00. The Probate Court (presided by Respondent Judge Sta. Maria) ordered these proceeds released to the executor to pay the approved debts of the estate. Petitioners opposed, arguing that since the final judgment in the reconveyance case awarded the properties to them personally and not to the estate, these properties and proceeds should not be liable for estate debts.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the properties and proceeds reconveyed to the heirs by final judgment in a separate civil action are subject to the debts of the decedent’s estate.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the right of heirs to specific, distributive shares of inheritance does not become finally determinable until all the debts of the estate are paid. Until then, their rights are inchoate and subject to the existence of a residue.

Petitioners' claim to the properties is based entirely on their status as heirs of Celestino Salvador. Therefore, even if the reconveyance judgment transferred the property to them, they hold it in trust for the estate, subject to its obligations. They cannot distribute the properties among themselves without the debts of the estate being first satisfied. The Court cited *Castellvi de Raquiza v. Castellvi*, *Jimoga-on v. Belmonte*, and Section 1, Rule 90 of the Rules of Court in support of the principle that hereditary rights are unenforceable until estate debts are settled.

Petition denied.
