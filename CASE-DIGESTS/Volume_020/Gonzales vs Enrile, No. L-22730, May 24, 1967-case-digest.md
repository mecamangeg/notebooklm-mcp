I. CAPTION
RAMON A. GONZALES v. JUAN PONCE ENRILE and RAFAEL M. SALAS, G.R. No. L-22730, May 24, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ramon A. Gonzales filed an original petition for prohibition to restrain respondents Executive Secretary and Commissioner of Customs from enforcing a presidential directive to burn confiscated "blue seal" cigarettes [1]. Gonzales alleged that on April 2, 1964, confiscated cigarettes were burned at the North Harbor in Manila pursuant to instructions from President Macapagal to stop auction sales and instead destroy such goods [2]. Petitioner argued this act violated Section 2601 of the Tariff and Customs Code, which mandates the sale of confiscated articles to satisfy duties and taxes, and constituted a waste of public funds [2]. Respondents countered that the directive was to burn only those goods unfit for sale or use, and that the 576 cases of cigarettes burned on April 2 and 7, 1964, had been certified as unfit for human consumption by the Condemnation Committee of the Bureau of Customs [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Commissioner of Customs has the authority to burn the confiscated cigarettes.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the burning of the confiscated cigarettes was authorized by law [5]. Under **Section 2608 of the Tariff and Customs Code**, the Collector of the port is empowered to order the destruction of articles coming into the custody of the Bureau of Customs if they are found to be unfit for use or sale or injurious to public health [6].

The record showed that the proper procedure was observed: a Condemnation Committee, which included a physician, examined the cigarettes and certified them as unfit for human consumption [3, 7]. The Court ruled that the Malacañang press release relied upon by the petitioner was "incompetent evidence" and could not override the respondents' proof that the burning was limited to instances allowed by law [5, 8]. Furthermore, the Court reiterated that the judiciary cannot inquire into the motives behind the formulation of government policies by the Executive [9, 10].

The petition is **DISMISSED**.
