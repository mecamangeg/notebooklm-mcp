The source material provided contains only the case caption details (title, docket number, date, and ponente) [1], but lacks the body of the decision necessary to draft the Facts, Issues, and Ruling sections of a case digest.

Would you like me to search for the full text of *People v. Gomez* (G.R. No. L-22345) so I can create the digest for you?
