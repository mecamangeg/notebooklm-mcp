**I. CAPTION**
IN RE: INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE LATE PIO DURAN. CIPRIANO DURAN and MIGUEL DURAN v. JOSEFINA B. DURAN, G.R. No. L-23372, June 14, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Pio Duran died intestate on February 28, 1961. On June 2, 1962, his brother, petitioner Cipriano Duran, executed a public instrument assigning and renouncing his hereditary rights to the estate in favor of the decedent's surviving spouse, respondent Josefina Duran, for P2,500.00. A year later, Cipriano filed a petition for intestate proceedings and sought to be appointed administrator. Josefina opposed the petition, arguing that Cipriano was no longer an "interested person" due to the deed of assignment. Cipriano countered that the deed was procured through fraud and lesion. Subsequently, another brother, Miguel Duran, filed a petition to join Cipriano as a co-petitioner.

The Court of First Instance of Albay dismissed Cipriano's petition for lack of interest, ruling that it could not collaterally examine the alleged fraud of the assignment in the intestate proceedings. Consequently, Miguel's petition to intervene was also dismissed. Petitioners appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N Cipriano Duran is an "interested person" qualified to institute intestate proceedings.
2. W/N the assignment of hereditary rights required court approval to be effective.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** Under **Section 2, Rule 79 of the Rules of Court**, a petition for settlement of an estate must be filed by an "interested person." Since Cipriano had assigned his hereditary share to Josefina before the institution of the intestate proceedings, he no longer had any interest in the estate. The Court held that until the deed of assignment is annulled or rescinded in an action specifically for that purpose, it is deemed valid and effective against him. Thus, he lacked the requisite interest to petition for settlement proceedings.

2. **NO.** The Court distinguished this case from *In re Irene Santos*, which involved an assignment *pendente lite* (during the course of settlement proceedings) that required court approval. Here, the assignment took place when no settlement proceedings were pending. The Court ruled that an assignment by a legal heir of his hereditary share before the institution of an intestate proceeding does not need court approval to be effective as between the parties. Citing *Hernandez v. Andal*, the Court noted that an extrajudicial partition is valid between participants even if the requisites of **Section 1, Rule 74** are not followed, as those requisites are for binding creditors and non-participating heirs only.

The order of dismissal was affirmed.
