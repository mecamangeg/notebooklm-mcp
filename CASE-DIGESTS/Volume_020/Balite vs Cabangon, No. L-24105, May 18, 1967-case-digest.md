I. CAPTION
JAIME BALITE v. THE HON. JUDGE DOMINGO CABANGON, DELFIN MACADANGDANG, ET AL., G.R. No. L-24105, May 18, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Macadangdang, et al. filed an ejectment petition against their tenant, petitioner Balite, in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). During the scheduled pre-trial on September 26, 1964, Balite and his counsel failed to appear and were declared in default. Counsel arrived shortly after, citing traffic, but his motion to lift the default was denied on October 3, 1964, and received on October 9. After subsequent motions for reconsideration were denied, Balite filed a petition for relief from the default order on January 5, 1965. Respondent Judge Cabangon dismissed the petition, calculating that 83 days had elapsed since Balite learned of the order, violating the 60-day period prescribed by Rule 38 of the Rules of Court. Balite filed a petition for prohibition with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for relief from the default order should be dismissed for being filed beyond the 60-day period prescribed by the Rules of Court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court found that the respondent Judge erred in his computation; the actual time elapsed was only 65 days (49 days from notice to the motion for reconsideration, plus 16 days from the denial of said motion to the filing of the petition for relief), making the petition late by only five days. Citing *Prudential Bank v. Macadaeg* and *Angala v. Tan*, the Court held that a few days in excess of the 60-day period is not fatal, as long as the petition for relief is filed within six months from the date the order was issued. Additionally, under Section 155 of the Agricultural Land Reform Code, the Agrarian Court is not bound by technicalities of procedure. The dismissal constituted grave abuse of discretion.

The order of dismissal is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings on the petition for relief.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Dizon, J., concurring:**
Justice Dizon concurred in the result but reasoned that Rule 38 applies only to final judgments. An order of default is merely interlocutory and subject to the control of the court; thus, it may be modified or rescinded at any time before final judgment, provided the petition to vacate is made within six months after entry of the order.
