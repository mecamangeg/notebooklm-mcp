I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. VICENTE TIU TUA PI v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20909, May 24, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Vicente Tiu Tua Pi, a 22-year-old single male, filed a petition for naturalization on April 29, 1961 [1]. He claimed an average annual income of P1,500.00, which increased to P2,400.00, as the assistant manager of Nanding Candy Station in Iloilo City [2]. He also cited free board and lodging and a small allowance for representation and travel [2]. During the trial, he attempted to bolster his financial capacity by claiming additional income as an insurance agent, presenting commissions of P2,520.00 (1959), P2,570.75 (1960), and P1,870.20 (1961) [2]. However, the income tax returns reflecting these commissions were filed belatedly on July 5, 1962, after the trial had already commenced [2]. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo ruled in favor of the petitioner, admitting him as a naturalized citizen [1]. The Republic appealed the decision [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner meets the requirement of having a lucrative income to qualify for naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the lower court. The Court held that the petitioner failed to meet the requirement of a lucrative income [2]. The Court ruled that commissions are not considered income for the purposes of a naturalization petition because they are "contingent and speculative" [2, 3]. The Court cited *Tan v. Republic* and *Lim v. Republic* to support this doctrine [2]. Furthermore, the Court noted that the evidence regarding the commissions did not command respect as the income tax returns were filed late and only after the trial had begun [2].

Consequently, the judgment of the lower court is reversed [2, 4].
