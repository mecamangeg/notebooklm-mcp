I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF LEE BING HOO TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. LEE BING HOO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22147, May 16, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On July 19, 1957, petitioner Lee Bing Hoo, a Chinese citizen, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. On June 3, 1961, the CFI granted the petition. No appeal was taken from this decision. However, on June 18, 1962, pending the two-year probationary period required by law, the Solicitor General moved to reopen the case, alleging that the petitioner had committed acts demonstrating reproachable character. The CFI granted the motion to reopen.

During the rehearing, evidence was presented showing that the petitioner had pending criminal cases for falsification and estafa in the Manila City Fiscal’s Office, police records for traffic violations, and significantly, that he maintained a paramour with whom he had six children. Consequently, on August 22, 1963, the trial court rendered a new decision denying the petition for naturalization. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the lower court lacked authority to reopen the case as the 1961 judgment had already become final.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 1961 decision granting the petition for naturalization had become final and executory, thereby precluding the lower court from reopening the case.
2. W/N the petitioner possesses the requisite good moral character to be naturalized.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A judgment in a naturalization case does not become final until after the certificate of naturalization is issued and after compliance with the requirements of Republic Act No. 530. Specifically, the decision does not become executory until after two years from its promulgation and after another hearing is conducted to determine compliance with the law [1]. Furthermore, a naturalization proceeding is not a judicial adversary proceeding; thus, the decision rendered therein is not *res judicata* regarding matters that support a judgment cancelling naturalization for illegal or fraudulent procurement [2].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner failed to prove good moral character. Evidence established that during the two-year probationary period, he was accused of various offenses and maintained a paramour with whom he had six children [3]. The Court cited established jurisprudence (*Sy Kiam v. Republic*, *Tan v. Republic*, etc.) stating that such conduct demonstrates a lack of good moral character required for citizenship [3].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
