**I. CAPTION**
NEMESIO HUANG (UY) v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20478, June 29, 1967, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
On November 2, 1953, Nemesio Huang (Uy) filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. Although the court ordered the notice of hearing to be published once a week for three consecutive weeks, the notice was actually published only once in the Official Gazette [1]. The CFI admitted Huang to Philippine citizenship, and he took his oath of allegiance on September 1, 1956 [1].

On May 29, 1957, the Supreme Court promulgated *Ong Son Cui v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-9858), establishing that a single publication in the Official Gazette is insufficient to confer jurisdiction on the trial court [2]. Relying on this doctrine, the Republic filed a petition on May 10, 1962, to cancel Huang's certificate of naturalization [2]. The CFI dismissed the Republic's petition on October 12, 1962 [3]. The Republic appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the doctrine in *Ong Son Cui* regarding publication requirements applies retroactively to nullify a certificate of naturalization issued prior to May 29, 1957.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court affirmed the order of the lower court. Citing the ruling in *Gan Tsitung v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-20819), the Court held that the doctrine laid down in *Ong Son Cui* applies only to certificates of naturalization issued after May 29, 1957 [2]. Certificates issued on or before that date are not to be nullified even if the notice of petition was published only once [2]. Since Huang took his oath on September 1, 1956, before the *Ong Son Cui* promulgation, his naturalization remains valid.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro, JJ., concurred [4].
