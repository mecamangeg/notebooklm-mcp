I. CAPTION
JOSE A. ARCHES v. ANACLETO I. BELLOSILLO and JAIME ARANETA, G.R. No. L-23534, May 16, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jose Arches filed his 1953 income tax return on February 27, 1954 [1]. On February 26, 1959, deficiency income and residence tax assessments were issued against him [1]. Since the assessments were uncontested, the Republic, represented by the BIR Regional Director, filed a suit on December 29, 1960, in the Municipal Court of Roxas City to recover P4,441.25 [2]. Arches moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of prescription and lack of express approval by the Revenue Commissioner as required by Section 308 of the Tax Code [2]. The Municipal Court denied the motion [3]. Arches filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Capiz, assailing the denial [3]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that certiorari was improper [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the verification by the Regional Director constitutes sufficient approval of the tax suit.
2. W/N the action to collect the deficiency taxes has prescribed.
3. W/N certiorari is the proper remedy to assail the denial of the motion to dismiss.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The verification by the Revenue Regional Director constitutes sufficient approval within the meaning of Section 308 of the Tax Code [4]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue delegated the power to approve tax suits to Regional Directors through Memorandum Order No. V-634, which was approved by the Secretary of Finance [5]. This regulation has the force and effect of law [5]. Furthermore, the requirement of approval is not jurisdictional but relates only to the capacity to sue or the cause of action [6].

2. **NO.** The action has not prescribed. The proper prescriptive period for bringing civil actions to collect taxes is five years from the date of the assessment under Section 332 of the Tax Code [7]. The three-year period provided in Section 51(d) of the Tax Code refers only to the summary remedies of distraint and levy [7]. The action was commenced one year and ten months after the assessments were made, well within the five-year period [7].

3. **NO.** An order denying a motion to dismiss is interlocutory [8]. The proper remedy for the unsuccessful movant is to await the judgment on the merits and appeal therefrom [8]. Certiorari is not the proper remedy, especially where there is no urgent reason to stop the suit, and the lower court did not commit grave abuse of discretion in upholding the suit based on valid revenue regulations [5], [8].

The dismissal of the petition for certiorari is affirmed [9].
