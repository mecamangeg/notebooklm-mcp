**I. CAPTION**
ONG CHIAN SUY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21739, May 30, 1967, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Ong Chian Suy filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur [1, 2]. The petition listed his present residence as San Roque, Iriga, Camarines Sur, and one former residence in Amoy, China [3]. However, during the proceedings, he testified that he had also stayed in Naga City and attended second-year high school in Tabaco, Albay [3]. Regarding his financial capacity, the petition averred an average annual income of P5,000.00 [4]. His 1960 income tax return reflected a net income of P5,593.75, while he estimated his 1961 income to be around P6,000.00 [4, 5]. He has a wife and three minor children to support [4, 5]. The trial court granted the petition, ruling he possessed all qualifications [2]. The Republic appealed on the grounds of defective petition regarding residence and lack of lucrative income [3, 5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petition is fatally defective for failing to state all former places of residence.
2. W/N the petitioner satisfies the lucrative income requirement.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law requires a petition to state the "present and former places of residence," which encompasses all places where the petitioner actually and physically resided [3]. The purpose of this rule is to facilitate the gathering of information and objections from people in the petitioner's actual surroundings [3]. Since Ong Chian Suy admitted to residing in Naga City and Tabaco, Albay, his failure to include these locations in the petition is fatal [3].

2. **NO.** Considering the petitioner has a wife and three minor children to support, an annual income ranging from P5,000.00 to P6,000.00 cannot be regarded as lucrative [4, 5].

The judgment appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the petition for Filipino citizenship is **DENIED** [5].
