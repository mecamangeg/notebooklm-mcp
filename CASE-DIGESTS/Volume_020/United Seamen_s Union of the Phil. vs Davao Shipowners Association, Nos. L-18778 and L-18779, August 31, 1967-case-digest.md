I. CAPTION
UNITED SEAMEN'S UNION OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DAVAO SHIPOWNERS ASSOCIATION, ANGTIONG SONS and/or RICARDO ANG, ANGLIONGTO SONS & COMPANY, GARCIA WATER TRANSPORTATION, COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, et al., G.R. Nos. L-18778 and L-18779, August 31, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner United Seamen's Union of the Philippines (USUP) presented labor demands to respondent Davao Shipowners Association (Shipowners). Shipowners informed USUP of an existing Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with the Davao Marine Association (Association) valid until the end of 1959. USUP filed a notice of strike even before receiving a formal answer. To settle the conflict, the parties signed a covenant on August 20, 1959, agreeing to maintain the *status quo* while USUP filed a petition for a certification election.

Subsequently, respondent shipping companies served termination notices on 64 employees effective December 31, 1959, citing business losses and dissolution. These employees were members of the Association. Claiming these dismissals constituted Unfair Labor Practice (ULP), USUP declared a strike on December 31, 1959. During the strike, members formed human cordons blocking wharves, took possession of vessels without permission, and inflicted physical injuries on non-strikers. The Shipowners filed for an injunction, and USUP filed a ULP case. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) dismissed the ULP complaint, declared the strike illegal, and issued a permanent injunction.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the strike declared by USUP was illegal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the CIR's ruling that the strike was illegal based on both its purpose and the means employed.

First, the strike violated the August 20 covenant to maintain the *status quo* and disregarded the existing CBA between the Shipowners and the Association [1, 2]. The Court found the dismissal of employees was a legitimate exercise of management prerogative under the CBA due to business losses, and not ULP [3, 4]. USUP's purpose was found to be a subterfuge to subvert valid commitments [5].

Second, the means employed were unlawful. The Court found substantial evidence that strikers resorted to coercion, force, intimidation, violence, and sabotage, including blocking the ingress/egress of vessels and assaulting stevedores [6, 7]. Citing *Liberal Labor Union vs. Phil. Can Co.*, the Court held that a strike characterized by violence and coercion cannot be justified in a regime of law, as it encourages terrorism and subverts the purpose of peaceful labor dispute settlement [8]. The legality of a strike depends on the purpose for which it is maintained and the means employed in carrying it on [9].

Decision affirmed.
