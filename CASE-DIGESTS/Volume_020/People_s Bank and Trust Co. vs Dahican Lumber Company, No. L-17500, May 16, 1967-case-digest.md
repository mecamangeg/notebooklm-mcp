I. CAPTION
PEOPLE'S BANK AND TRUST CO. and ATLANTIC GULF AND PACIFIC CO. OF MANILA v. DAHICAN LUMBER COMPANY, DAHICAN AMERICAN LUMBER CORPORATION and CONNELL BROS. CO. (PHIL.), G.R. No. L-17500, May 16, 1967, 20 SCRA 84, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On September 8, 1948, Atlantic Gulf & Pacific Co. (ATLANTIC) sold its rights in the Dahican Lumber concession to Dahican Lumber Co. (DALCO). To develop the concession, DALCO obtained loans from People's Bank (BANK) and the Export-Import Bank, secured by the BANK. On July 13, 1950, DALCO executed mortgages in favor of the BANK and ATLANTIC covering its land and personal properties [1]-[2]. These deeds contained an "after-acquired properties" clause, stipulating that all properties subsequently acquired, installed, or used in the concession would immediately become subject to the mortgage lien [3].

DALCO later purchased various machineries and supplies. Dahican American Lumber Corp. (DAMCO) and Connell Bros. Co. (CONNELL) claimed to be the suppliers/financiers of these properties. Upon DALCO's failure to pay the fifth promissory note, the BANK paid the Export-Import Bank and acquired the credit [4]. On December 16, 1952, DALCO's Board resolved to rescind the alleged sales of the equipment with DAMCO and CONNELL to return the properties and evade the mortgage lien [5]. The BANK and ATLANTIC filed for foreclosure. The lower court ordered DALCO to pay the principal sums but ordered the "after-acquired properties" sold, recognizing the validity of the mortgage but making specific dispositions regarding the proceeds that both parties appealed [6]-[7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the "after-acquired properties" clause in the mortgage deeds is valid and binding.
2. W/N the "after-acquired properties" are subject to the mortgage lien despite not being registered under the Chattel Mortgage Law.
3. W/N the rescission of sales between DALCO and DAMCO/CONNELL defeated the mortgage lien.
4. W/N the foreclosure action was premature.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The stipulation covering "after-acquired properties" is common, logical, and lawful [8]. Its purpose is to maintain the original value of the properties given as security, especially where the collateral is perishable or subject to wear and tear [8]. The intent of the parties was clear that such properties would automatically become subject to the lien [8].

2. **YES.** The "after-acquired properties" (machinery, fixtures, tools) installed by DALCO in its lumber concession became **immobilized** under Article 415 of the Civil Code (and Art. 334 of the old Code), as they were intended for use in the industry carried on in the premises [9], [10]. Since the real estate mortgages were registered, they did not need to be registered a second time as chattel mortgages to bind these properties or affect third parties [10]. Furthermore, the parties are estopped from claiming the properties are chattels because they expressly characterized them as real property in the mortgage deeds [11].

3. **NO.** DAMCO and CONNELL were not "unpaid sellers" with a superior vendor's lien but merely financiers who knew the properties were covered by the mortgage [12]. The rescission of sales was a fraudulent attempt to defeat the mortgage lien [12]. Creditors are protected against contracts intended to defraud them (Arts. 1313 and 1314, New Civil Code) [13].

4. **NO.** While the BANK gave an extension to pay until April 1, 1953, and the suit was filed in February, DALCO was insolvent [14]. Under Article 1198 of the Civil Code, a debtor loses the benefit of the period when he becomes insolvent unless he gives a guaranty or security [15].

**Disposition:** The judgment is MODIFIED. The proceeds of the sale of the "after-acquired properties" are awarded exclusively to the plaintiffs. The defendants are held solidarily liable for the expenses of the receivership and attorney's fees. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.
