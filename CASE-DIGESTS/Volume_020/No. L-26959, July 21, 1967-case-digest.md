I. CAPTION
OSCAR V. CO v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, ABELARDO SUBIDO, and CECILIO O. ESTOESTA, G.R. No. L-26959, July 21, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On November 2, 1964, petitioner Oscar V. Co received a provisional appointment from the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) as "Election Registrar" without a specific station [1]. He was subsequently directed via telegram to assume duty in Agoo, La Union [1]. On September 6, 1966, COMELEC issued Co a permanent appointment as Election Registrar for Sabangan, Mountain Province [1]. The following day, respondent Cecilio O. Estoesta was appointed Election Registrar for Agoo, La Union [1, 2]. Co refused the new appointment and sought reconsideration, arguing that his removal from Agoo violated his security of tenure [2]. He subsequently filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, and quo warranto before the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the transfer of the petitioner from Agoo, La Union to Sabangan, Mountain Province violates his security of tenure.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the transfer did not violate the petitioner's security of tenure [4]. Reiterating the doctrine in *Ibañez v. Commission on Elections* (G.R. No. L-26558), the Court distinguished between *appointment* and *assignment* [4]. The rule proscribing transfers without consent applies only when an officer is appointed to a particular station [4]. Since the petitioner’s initial appointment did not specify a station and he was merely *assigned* to Agoo, he acquired no vested right to that specific location [4]. Therefore, he could be reassigned to Sabangan in the interest of the service without violating the Constitution [4, 5].

Petition dismissed [6].
