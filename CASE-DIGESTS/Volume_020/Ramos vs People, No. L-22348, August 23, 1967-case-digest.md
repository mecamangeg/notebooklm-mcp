I. CAPTION
**GREGORIO RAMOS and CONRADO RAMOS v. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES and COURT OF APPEALS**, G.R. No. L-22348, August 23, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On November 20, 1957, in Romblon, Ludovico Rovira informed his cousin Benjamin Rovira and petitioner Gregorio Ramos that he had been boxed by the victim, Rufino Gotangco, a political rival. Seeking revenge, Benjamin, Gregorio, and Fortunato Galang (armed with a bolo) proceeded to barrio Cambajao to confront Rufino. Petitioner Conrado Ramos, Gregorio's brother, was seen walking fast on a parallel road and allegedly urged the group to "hurry" and "advance."

A policeman stopped the trio at a bridge but allowed Gregorio to proceed after he claimed he was merely going to town. Upon locating Rufino, Gregorio rolled up his trousers, drew a *balisong*, and shouted a challenge ("Pinong, celebracion ta na"). Rufino ran but slipped and fell; Gregorio overtook him and stabbed him repeatedly, killing him. Conrado, who arrived later, threw a stone at Rufino’s companion, Salvio, who was stoning Gregorio.

The Court of First Instance convicted both Ramos brothers of murder qualified by treachery and aggravated by evident premeditation. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but ruled that evident premeditation was not present, slightly reducing the penalty. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the killing was attended by treachery.
2. W/N the killing was qualified by evident premeditation.
3. W/N Conrado Ramos is criminally liable as a co-principal for the death of the victim.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Suddenness of attack alone does not conclusively show treachery; the victim must be completely deprived of a chance to prepare or retreat. Here, Gregorio shouted a challenge and warning from six meters away before attacking. The victim was not deprived of the opportunity to evade the attack and was in fact able to run away until he accidentally slipped [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The crime committed by Gregorio is Murder qualified by evident premeditation. The facts established a criminal plan hatched when the group set out to avenge Ludovico. The distance of 1.5 kilometers to the crime scene and the delay when stopped by the policeman provided sufficient time for the accused to reflect on their actions. Gregorio’s use of a pretext to bypass the policeman confirmed his determination to carry out the plan [3-5].

3. **NO.** Conrado Ramos is acquitted due to reasonable doubt. There was no evidence of a prior agreement or conspiracy involving him. His presence on a separate road could be attributed to chance, and he was not with the group when the plan was conceived. His act of stoning Salvio was done to defend his brother Gregorio, who was being stoned, and not to assist in the killing of Rufino. Absent proof of direct participation or conspiracy, he cannot be held liable as a principal, accomplice, or accessory [6-8].

**Judgment is MODIFIED.** The conviction of Gregorio Ramos for Murder is AFFIRMED (with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender), while the judgment against Conrado Ramos is REVERSED and he is ACQUITTED.
