I. CAPTION
PAGKAKAISANG ITINATAGUYOD NG MGA MANGGAGAWA SA ANG TIBAY (PIMA), ELISEO SAMSON, ET AL. v. ANG TIBAY, INCORPORATED, PRUDENCIO TEODORO and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-22273, May 16, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Union (PIMA) filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) against respondent Ang Tibay, Inc. in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [1, 2]. The Union alleged that the Company violated their Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) regarding wage increases and vacation leaves, and summarily dismissed union members Jesus Guevarra and Asuncion Ablaza due to union activities [3-5]. Consequently, the Union staged a strike on November 14, 1957 [6]. When strikers attempted to return to work, the Company refused to readmit them unless they apologized and signed a pledge not to destroy company property, which the strikers refused [7].

The CIR found that the dismissals and refusal of leave were justified and not motivated by union activities [8]. It declared the strike illegal for violating the CBA's grievance machinery and dismissed the ULP complaint [8]. The CIR further ruled it lacked jurisdiction to reinstate the strikers as the ULP charges were unproven [8]. On appeal, the Union changed its theory, arguing the Company violated the CBA provision against summary dismissal [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Company committed Unfair Labor Practice by exacting a promise from returning strikers not to destroy property.
2. W/N the violation of a Collective Bargaining Agreement is cognizable by the Court of Industrial Relations.
3. W/N the CIR can order the reinstatement of strikers after ULP charges are dismissed.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the exaction by the employer of a promise from returning strikers not to destroy company property or commit acts of reprisal was an act of self-preservation designed to ensure peace and order, not to discourage union membership [10, 11]. Under the Industrial Peace Act, ULP involves discrimination in tenure for the purpose of encouraging or discouraging union membership [12, 13].

2. **NO.** The violation by an employer of the terms of a Collective Bargaining Agreement (such as summary dismissal without prior investigation) is a breach of contract redressable in regular courts, not in the CIR [10, 11, 14]. The Court noted that the Union's shift to the CBA violation argument was an improper change of theory on appeal [9, 15].

3. **NO.** The CIR has no authority to order the reinstatement of strikers after they have failed to prove the unfair labor practice charges against the employer [12, 13, 16].

Resolution affirmed [17, 18].
