I. CAPTION
TEODORO JULIANO, petitioner, vs. COURT OF APPEALS and DATU MANDO SINSUAT, respondents., G.R. No. L-27477, July 28, 1967, 20 SCRA 808, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
In the November 12, 1963 elections for City Mayor of Cotabato, the City Board of Canvassers proclaimed respondent Datu Mando Sinsuat elected with a plurality of 30 votes over petitioner Teodoro Juliano. Juliano filed a protest with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cotabato. The CFI declared Juliano the winner by 283 votes. Sinsuat appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which reversed the CFI decision and declared Sinsuat the winner by 17 votes (later reduced to 13 upon motion for reconsideration). In its resolution on the motion for reconsideration, the CA refused to rule on 40 ballots claimed by Juliano as valid, reasoning that they were claimed for the first time in said motion and not in his brief, and thus were barred by procedural technicalities. Juliano appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Appeals erred in refusing to consider ballots claimed for the first time in a Motion for Reconsideration.
2. W/N ballots written partly in Arabic and partly in Roman script are valid.
3. W/N the writing of "Straight Liberal Party" or "Straight Nacionalista" constitutes a distinguishing mark.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of Appeals erred. The Supreme Court ruled that the circumstance that a claim was made in a motion for reconsideration should not deter the court from examining and ruling on those ballots. Election contests involve public interest, and technicalities must not obstruct the determination of the true will of the electorate. An appeal in an election contest proceeds as in a criminal case, and the appellate court may review any ballot *motu proprio* if necessary to arrive at a correct decision (*Borja v. De Leon*). The decisive circumstance making it mandatory for the court to rule on a ballot is that it is *before the court* and claimed by a party.

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that ballots written partly in Arabic and partly in Roman script are valid. The Court took judicial notice that in Cotabato, a large segment of the population consists of Muslims who speak and write Arabic. With the spread of English instruction, it is expected that voters might use mixed scripts. Absent evidence that such mixed writing was a device deliberately resorted to for identification, doubts must be resolved in favor of validity (Rule 8, Section 149, Revised Election Code).

3. **NO.** The writing of "Straight Liberal Party" or "Straight Nacionalista" does not constitute distinguishing marks. These words simply emphasize the voter's intention to vote for the candidates of a specific party (block voting traces). Without evidence *aliunde* that these words were intended to identify the ballot, they are considered valid (*Gutierrez v. Aquino*).

Petition **GRANTED**. The decision of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED**, and Teodoro Juliano is declared the duly elected City Mayor of Cotabato City.
