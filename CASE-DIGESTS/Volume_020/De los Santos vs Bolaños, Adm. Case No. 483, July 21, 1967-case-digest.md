I. CAPTION
GIL DE LOS SANTOS v. MARIO BOLAÑOS, Adm. Case No. 483, July 21, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Gil de los Santos filed a disbarment complaint against Respondent Atty. Mario Bolaños, an Assistant Provincial Fiscal, alleging fraud and misappropriation [1]. The dispute arose from a parcel of land originally owned by the late Andres de los Santos, which was adjudicated to his widow, Elisa Rañola, and subsequently sold to Respondent [2]. Complainant filed a civil case for partition, claiming to be Andres' son from a first marriage [3]. Believing this representation, Respondent entered into an agreement with Complainant [4]. However, it was later discovered through a baptismal certificate that Complainant was actually the son of one Ramon Epifanio, not Andres [4]. Complainant admitted this fact, voluntarily signed an acknowledgment of Respondent's ownership, and dismissed the partition case [4, 5]. When Respondent later mortgaged the land to PNB for P5,000, Complainant demanded a share of the proceeds based on the previously rescinded agreement [5]. When Respondent refused, Complainant filed this administrative case [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent is guilty of unethical conduct warranting disbarment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court dismissed the complaint, finding no proof of fraud or deceit on the part of the Respondent [4, 6]. The record showed that Respondent entered into the initial agreement in good faith, relying on Complainant's false representation regarding his paternity [4]. Upon discovery that Complainant was not the son of the deceased owner, Complainant voluntarily agreed to cancel the agreement and recognized Respondent's ownership in a handwritten memorandum [4]. The Court adopted the Solicitor General's recommendation that without proof of unethical conduct, there is no sufficient ground to proceed against a member of the legal profession [4, 6].

Accordingly, the case was dismissed [6].
