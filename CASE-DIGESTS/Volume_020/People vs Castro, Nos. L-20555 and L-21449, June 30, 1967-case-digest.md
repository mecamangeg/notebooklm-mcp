I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ZOILO CASTRO, G.R. Nos. L-20555 and L-21449, June 30, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On November 29, 1952, in San Fernando, Pampanga, accused Zoilo Castro, an off-duty policeman, went to the house of Moises Gomez where a gambling game was in progress. An altercation ensued between Castro's companion and Donaciano Vitug [1, 2]. Castro challenged Donaciano to a fight, but Moises Gomez intervened to pacify him. Gomez raised his hands and said, "We will not fight you" [3]. Castro then shot Gomez in the head, killing him, and subsequently shot and wounded Candido Vitug, who had come out of the house [3].

Castro claimed self-defense, alleging he was pushed and hit by a stone before shooting [4]. The Court of First Instance of Pampanga rejected this defense, convicting Castro of Murder for the death of Gomez and Attempted Murder for the shooting of Candido Vitug [5]. Castro appealed, questioning the credibility of prosecution witnesses and the finding of guilt [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the killing of Gomez constitutes murder qualified by treachery.
2. W/N the crime committed against Candido Vitug is attempted murder.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's findings on credibility, ruling that the victim was shot while his hands were raised in a gesture of surrender or fright [7]. This placed the victim in a clearly defenseless position, constituting treachery which qualifies the offense as Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code [7]. The Court rejected the affidavits of recantation by witnesses, noting they were made to facilitate an amicable settlement, which is not allowed in criminal cases [7, 8].

2. **YES.** While one doctor testified that Candido Vitug's wounds would have been fatal without medical attendance, another doctor testified that the wounds were not necessarily fatal [9]. The Court resolved this doubt in favor of the accused, affirming the lower court's classification of the crime as Attempted Murder rather than Frustrated Murder [9].

The judgment was MODIFIED regarding the penalties to account for the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. Castro was sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 10 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 17 years, 4 months, and 1 day of *reclusion temporal* for the Murder, and a modified prison term for the Attempted Murder [10].
