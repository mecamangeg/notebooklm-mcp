I. CAPTION
In Re: Petition for the correction and/or Marginal Annotation of Entries in the Birth Certificate of Oscar Sia Oliva. DOMINGO DY OLIVA and VICENTA SIA OLIVA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21806, August 17, 1967, 20 SCRA 1070, Reyes, J.B.L., Acting C.J.

II. FACTS
On January 22, 1963, spouses Domingo Dy Oliva and Vicenta Sia Oliva filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Pasay City) to correct entries in the birth certificate of their son, Oscar Sia Oliva. They alleged that due to mistake and inadvertence, the nationality of the parents was entered as "Chinese" instead of "Filipino" in the child's birth certificate, despite both parents allegedly being Filipino citizens [1]. The Solicitor General opposed the petition. The lower court ruled in favor of the spouses, ordering the Local Civil Registrar to substitute "Filipino" for "Chinese" in the registry [2]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that citizenship cannot be the subject of a summary proceeding for correction of entries [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the correction of nationality in the civil registry may be granted through a summary proceeding under Article 412 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the summary proceeding under Article 412 of the Civil Code is strictly limited to "innocuous or clerical mistakes," such as misspelled names or errors in occupation [4, 5]. Corrections involving the civil status, nationality, or citizenship of parents are "grave and important matters" that conclusively affect the citizenship of the offspring [5]. Such substantial changes cannot be granted in a summary proceeding but require a proper suit under Rule 108 of the Revised Rules of Court, which mandates notice and publication to all interested parties to ensure due process [5, 6]. The Court emphasized that even if the parents presented evidence of their Philippine citizenship, the summary proceeding remains improper for resolving issues of citizenship [7].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DISMISSED**, without prejudice to a new proceeding under Rule 108 [6].
