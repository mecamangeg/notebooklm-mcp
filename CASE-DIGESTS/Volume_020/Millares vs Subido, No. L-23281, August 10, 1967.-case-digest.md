I. CAPTION
BILLY MILLARES v. ABELARDO SUBIDO, et al., G.R. No. L-23281, August 10, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., Acting C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Billy Millares, a lawyer employed in the Manila City Treasurer's Office since 1946 with a salary of P3,120.00 per annum, was appointed as "Technical Assistant on Fiscal Matters" in the Office of the City Mayor with a salary of P6,600.00 per annum [1]. The appointment was noted as a "transfer" and approved by a Division Chief of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) [1]. Subsequently, Acting CSC Commissioner Abelardo Subido issued an order terminating Millares’ services, citing that: (1) the position did not require professional legal knowledge, so Millares' bar eligibility was only equivalent to second grade; and (2) the transfer involving an immediate salary increase violated Civil Service rules [2]. Millares filed a petition for mandamus. The Court of First Instance ruled in his favor, declaring him qualified and the removal illegal [3]. Subido appealed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Millares is qualified for the position based on his bar eligibility.
2. W/N the transfer accompanied by an immediate salary increase is valid.
3. W/N the CSC Commissioner has the authority to terminate Millares' services based on an improper transfer.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that Millares is qualified. Under R.A. No. 1080, passing the bar examination is equivalent to First Grade Civil Service eligibility if the duties of the position involve knowledge of the profession [5]. The duties of a "Technical Assistant on Fiscal Matters"—which include studying revenue measures, investigating cases, and proposing ordinances—require the use of Millares' knowledge as a lawyer [6, 7].

2. **NO.** A transfer is a lateral movement to a position of *equivalent* rank or salary, while a promotion denotes a scalar ascent with an increase in duties and salary [8]. A transfer accompanied by a promotion (immediate salary increase) is invalid as it violates Civil Service rules designed to safeguard seniority [9]. However, considering Millares’ qualifications and the equities of the case, the Court ruled he is entitled to the full salary rate after completing a three-month service period in the new position, consistent with CSC policy [10, 11].

3. **NO.** The CSC Commissioner's power to remove or suspend subordinate officers must be based on causes provided in Section 33, Article VII of R.A. No. 2260 (Civil Service Act), and requires due notice and hearing [12]. An "improper transfer" is not a legal ground for dismissal. While the Commissioner may disapprove an appointment or salary increase, he has no basis to summarily terminate the employee's services [12, 13].

The decision of the lower court is **MODIFIED**. The CSC Commissioner's authority to withhold approval of the immediate salary increase is upheld; Millares is entitled to his previous salary rate (P3,120.00) for the first three months of his transfer, and the full rate (P6,600.00) thereafter. The order terminating his services is declared **INVALID** [13].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Makalintal, Bengzon, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred with the decision [14].
