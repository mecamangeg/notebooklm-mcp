I. CAPTION
AUYONG HIAN (HONG WHUA HANG) v. JUDGE GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL, et al., G.R. No. L-24704, July 10, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Auyong Hian filed a petition for *mandamus* and *certiorari* with preliminary injunction against Judge Cloribel and Consolidated Tobacco Industries of the Philippines, Inc. (CTIP). Petitioner sought to annul Judge Cloribel's order of June 9, 1965 in Civil Case No. 59344, which validated the release of 600 hogsheads of tobacco to CTIP, and to compel the dismissal of said civil case [1]. The Supreme Court issued a preliminary injunction preventing the enforcement of the order and the disposal of the tobacco [2]. Subsequently, CTIP moved to dismiss the petition, arguing the case had become academic because Judge Cloribel had already voluntarily ordered the dismissal of Civil Case No. 59344 and declared his June 9, 1965 order of no further legal effect—precisely the reliefs Petitioner sought in the Supreme Court [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for *certiorari* and *mandamus* should be dismissed for being moot.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the instant case is dismissed because it has become academic [5, 6]. The objective of the petition—to annul the lower court's order and dismiss the civil case—had effectively been achieved by the lower court's subsequent actions vacating the disputed order and dismissing the case [3, 4]. The Court cited the related case of *Auyong Hian v. Court of Tax Appeals* (G.R. No. L-25181, Jan. 11, 1967) as basis for the dismissal [5, 6].

Case dismissed [5, 7].
