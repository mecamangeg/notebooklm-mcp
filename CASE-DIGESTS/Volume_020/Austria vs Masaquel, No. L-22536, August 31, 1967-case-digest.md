I. CAPTION
DOMINGO V. AUSTRIA v. HON. ANTONIO C. MASAQUEL, G.R. No. L-22536, August 31, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Domingo Austria was a plaintiff in a civil case for recovery of land wherein respondent Judge Antonio Masaquel initially rendered a decision in his favor. However, after the defendant hired Atty. Mariano Sicat, a former associate of Judge Masaquel, the Judge granted the defendant's motions to stay execution and for a new trial over petitioner's objections [1, 2]. Rumors circulated that the defendant would win because of his new counsel [3, 4].

Before the scheduled new trial on February 10, 1964, Austria's counsel approached the Judge in chambers to request his inhibition due to his former association with the defendant's lawyer. The Judge refused [5, 6]. In open court, the Judge asked Austria if he authorized the request and if he had lost faith in the Judge's fairness. Austria answered, "Yes, sir" [7, 8]. Deeming this offensive and an affront to the court's dignity, Judge Masaquel declared Austria in direct contempt and fined him P50.00 [9, 10].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner's request for inhibition and his truthful admission of doubt regarding the Judge's integrity constitute direct contempt of court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court annulled the contempt order. The Court held that while the former association of a judge with a counsel is not a mandatory ground for disqualification under Rule 137, it may constitute a just or valid reason for voluntary inhibition [11]. The petitioner's request was impelled by a "justifiable apprehension" and was made through counsel in a respectful manner [12].

Regarding the petitioner's answer in open court, the Court ruled that he did not commit contempt by answering "Yes, sir" when asked if he doubted the Judge's integrity. The Judge asked a question that necessarily expected a truthful answer, and the petitioner was simply being candid [8, 13]. A citizen is entitled to an honest opinion about a judge, and a judge should not be "so thin-skinned or sensitive" to feel hurt by it [14].

For direct contempt to exist, the behavior must be "contumacious" or show "arrogant belligerence" (*Matutina v. Buslon*) [8, 13]. The power to punish for contempt must be exercised on the preservative and not the vindictive principle (*Villavicencio v. Lukban*) [15].

The petition was granted, the order set aside, and the fine ordered refunded [15].
