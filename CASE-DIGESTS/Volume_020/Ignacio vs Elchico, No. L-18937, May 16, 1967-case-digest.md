I. CAPTION
INTESTATE ESTATE OF ENCARNACION ELCHICO VDA. DE FERNANDO; NATIVIDAD E. IGNACIO and LEONOR E. ALMAZAN v. EDUARDO ELCHICO and FLORENCIO ELCHICO, G.R. No. L-18937, May 16, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
In the intestate proceedings for the settlement of the estate of Encarnacion Elchico Vda. de Fernando in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, a partial partition was approved in 1956. The heirs, including Jose L. Elchico, took possession of their respective shares. Jose received a transportation business and a parcel of land on Misericordia Street, Manila. Subsequently, Jose died, and settlement proceedings for his estate were instituted in the CFI of Rizal. Oppositors-appellees Eduardo and Florencio Elchico were appointed co-administrators of Jose's estate.

Petitioners-appellants (administratrices of Encarnacion’s estate) filed a motion in the Manila probate court to turn over the Misericordia lot to them. They argued that the property was needed to satisfy Jose’s share of the outstanding obligations of Encarnacion’s estate, consisting of claims and taxes. Jose's administrators opposed the motion, citing that the property was under the jurisdiction of the Rizal court and that the proper procedure was under Rule 88 of the Rules of Court. The Manila court denied the motion and instead set a hearing to determine the amount and manner of Jose’s contribution to the estate's debts.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Manila probate court correctly denied the motion to return the property and ordered a hearing to fix the heir's contributive share.
2. W/N the Manila probate court can interfere with assets under the administration of the Rizal probate court.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the Manila probate court acted correctly under **Section 6, Rule 88 of the Rules of Court**. This provision states that where heirs have entered into possession of portions of the estate before debts are settled, the court must, "after hearing, settle the amount of their several liabilities, and order how much and in what manner each person shall contribute." In this case, the total liabilities of Encarnacion's estate were indefinite, and Jose’s specific share of the obligation was unknown [1]. Without a hearing to determine the specific amount Jose's estate must contribute, an order for the return of the distributed property would be premature [2]. Once the obligation is fixed, execution may issue to compel payment to the extent of the property received (**Art. 1311, Civil Code**) [2].

2. **NO.** The Misericordia property is *in custodia legis* of the Rizal CFI, which is a coordinate court with the Manila CFI [3]. The Supreme Court ruled that a probate court cannot intermeddle with the authority of another coordinate court regarding assets under the latter's administration without leave or consent [3]. To sanction such interference would lead to confusion and impair the administration of justice, especially since the Rizal court had already issued orders regarding the sale of said property [4].

**Orders affirmed.**
