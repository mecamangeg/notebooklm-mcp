**I. CAPTION**
**ZAMBOANGA GENERAL UTILITIES, INC. v. THE HON. SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE & NATURAL RESOURCES, THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS and GOODRICH INTERNATIONAL RUBBER COMPANY, INC.**, G.R. No. L-21275, July 31, 1967, Angeles, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Zamboanga General Utilities filed a protest with the Bureau of Lands against respondent Goodrich International Rubber Company for encroaching on public land in Zamboanga. The Director of Lands awarded portions of the disputed lot to both parties. Petitioner appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, who affirmed the decision.

Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Basilan City to review the administrative decision. Respondents moved to dismiss, arguing that under Section 44(h) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 and the ruling in *Samar Mining Co. v. Amado*, the CFI of Basilan lacked jurisdiction to review acts of national officials (the Secretary and Director) performed outside its territorial boundaries. The CFI granted the motion and dismissed the petition. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance of Basilan has jurisdiction to review the administrative decisions of national officials who hold office outside its territorial jurisdiction.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the order of dismissal. The Court distinguished this case from *Samar Mining* and *Acosta v. Alvendia*, noting that those cases involved petitions for writs of *injunction* seeking to control acts committed outside the court's territorial jurisdiction.

Here, the petition is for *certiorari* to determine the legal correctness of an administrative decision. Citing *Gayacao v. Executive Secretary*, the Court held that the power of judicial review over administrative decisions is not confined to the courts where the national officials maintain their offices. It extends to the courts where the plaintiffs reside and where the questioned decisions are being enforced. To rule otherwise would deny litigants of limited means access to the courts and unnecessarily burden the dockets of courts in Manila.

While the CFI’s power to issue injunctive writs is territorially limited, the preliminary injunction in this case had already been dissolved, leaving only the main petition for certiorari, which the CFI had jurisdiction to hear.

**Disposition:** The Order of dismissal is set aside and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.
