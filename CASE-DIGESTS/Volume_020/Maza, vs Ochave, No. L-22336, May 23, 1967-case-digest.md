I. CAPTION
MERCEDES DE LA MAZA v. MARCELO OCHAVE, in his capacity as Mayor of Alaminos, Pangasinan, G.R. No. L-22336, May 23, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Mercedes de la Maza held a permanent appointment as a clerk in the Municipal Treasurer's Office of Alaminos, Pangasinan [1]. On January 29, 1960, following an altercation with co-employees, she tendered her resignation to Respondent Mayor Marcelo Ochave [2, 3]. Subsequently, on March 7, 1960, the Municipal Council abolished her position due to the vacancy and a municipal budget deficit [4, 5].

On May 27, 1961—more than a year after her resignation and the abolition of her post—Petitioner filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan to compel the payment of her salaries, effectively seeking reinstatement [6, 7]. The trial court dismissed the petition, ruling that the action was filed beyond the one-year period allowed for such claims. The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner’s action for reinstatement is barred by prescription or abandonment.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts, holding that the petitioner's action was time-barred. The Court reiterated the settled rule that any person claiming a right to a position in the civil service must file their petition for reinstatement within one year from the date of their alleged illegal removal [7]. Failure to do so results in the petitioner being considered as having abandoned the office [7]. This period aligns with Section 16, Rule 66 of the Rules of Court regarding *quo warranto* proceedings [7].

Here, the Petitioner filed her suit on May 27, 1961, which was well past one year from the effective date of her removal—whether reckoned from her resignation (January 29, 1960) or the abolition of her position (March 7, 1960) [7, 9]. Additionally, the Court noted that the abolition of the office was valid as it was done in good faith for economy, specifically due to a budget overdraft, and no new appointment was made to the position [5, 10].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [11].
