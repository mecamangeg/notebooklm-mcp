**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MARCELO CONSTANTINO, GREGORIO CONSTANTINO, HILARION CONSTANTINO, and FAUSTO CONSTANTINO, G.R. No. L-23558, August 10, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
On June 24, 1963, Sabas Constantino, a close relative of the appellants, was stabbed by Inocencio Romaguera, the brother-in-law of the victim, Carlino Perdido. On the morning of June 28, 1963, Carlino went to his farm in Barrio Santor, Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, and did not return. His body was found the next day with multiple stab wounds. Prosecution witnesses, including a 12-year-old boy, testified seeing the four appellants chasing Carlino with bolos and later returning with blood-stained weapons [1]. Police recovered blood-stained bolos and clothing from the homes of Hilarion and Gregorio [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance of Cagayan convicted all four appellants of murder and sentenced them to life imprisonment [4]. The appellants appealed, interposing the defenses of alibi (for Marcelo, Fausto, and Gregorio) and self-defense (for Hilarion) [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the defenses of alibi and self-defense are meritorious.
2. W/N conspiracy existed among the appellants.
3. W/N the mitigating circumstances of passion and obfuscation or proximate vindication of a grave offense apply.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** Alibi cannot overcome the positive identification of the accused by credible witnesses unless it is clearly established that it was physically impossible for them to be at the scene of the crime [6]. Fausto and Gregorio failed to prove it was impossible for them to travel from Dugo, Cagayan to the crime scene, while Marcelo was only two kilometers away [7, 8]. Regarding Hilarion, his plea of self-defense is negated by the nature, number, and location of the decedent's wounds (including three at the back), his failure to present the weapon allegedly used by the victim, and his failure to report the incident to authorities [8].

2. **YES.** Conspiracy was sufficiently established by the collective acts of the appellants: chasing the decedent while armed with bolos, returning with blood-stained weapons, and the recovery of said weapons from their homes [9]. Additionally, Marcelo had made threats against the decedent days prior [9]. These circumstances imply a closeness of association and concurrence of sentiment regarding the unlawful object [10].

3. **NO.** There is neither passion and obfuscation nor proximate vindication of a grave offense because the killing of the decedent was committed four days after the stabbing of the appellants' kin [11]. The lapse of time allowed for reflection, and the Court emphasized that "vengeance is not a lawful sentiment" [11].

The judgment of conviction is **AFFIRMED** *in toto* [10].
