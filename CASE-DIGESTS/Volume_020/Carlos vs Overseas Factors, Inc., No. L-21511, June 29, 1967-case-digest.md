**I. CAPTION**
GERTRUDES CARLOS v. OVERSEAS FACTORS, INC. and BRIGIDO P. VALENCIA, G.R. No. L-21511, June 29, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
In September 1954, Overseas Factors, Inc. (Overseas) entered into contracts to supply rice to the National Rice and Corn Corporation (NARIC) [1]. Lacking funds for the required marginal cash deposits and expenses, Overseas entered into a joint venture with Gertrudes Carlos on September 6, 1954 [2]. Carlos agreed to finance the deposits and expenses in exchange for an equal share of the proceeds. The agreement stipulated that proceeds would be divided equally after deducting expenses, but liquidation "shall not take place until the rice is fully paid for by the NARIC" [3, 4]. Brigido Valencia, Overseas' president, personally guaranteed the obligation [2].

On May 27, 1959, Carlos filed a suit against Overseas and Valencia to recover her deposits, expenses, and alleged share in profits, claiming the rice had been "fully paid for" because NARIC had satisfied the price due to the Pakistan vendors via letters of credit [5, 6]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, finding that NARIC had not paid Overseas any proceeds and that the transaction actually resulted in a loss of over P1.2 million for Overseas [7, 8]. Carlos appealed directly to the Supreme Court [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Carlos has a cause of action to recover her contribution and share in profits from the joint venture.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint. The Court held that under the specific terms of the joint venture, Carlos' right to recover expenses and profits was dependent on a condition precedent: the liquidation of proceeds, which could not occur until the rice was "fully paid for by the NARIC" [8, 9].

The Court rejected Carlos' argument that NARIC's issuance of letters of credit to the Pakistan suppliers constituted payment. The contract contemplated payment *by NARIC to Overseas* for the rice imported, not payment *by NARIC* to third-party suppliers to settle Overseas' debts [6]. The evidence established that NARIC had not paid Overseas any proceeds and that the venture resulted in significant losses [8, 10]. Since the condition for liquidation had not occurred and no profits existed, Carlos had no cause of action against the defendants [10].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed [11].
