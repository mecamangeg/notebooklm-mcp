I. CAPTION
ANGELO KING v. PABLO JOE and HENRY C. CORRO, G.R. No. L-23617, August 26, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On March 5, 1964, the City Court of Manila rendered judgment ordering defendants Pablo Joe and Henry C. Corro to pay plaintiff Angelo King the sum of P4,410.00 with interest and attorney's fees [1]. The defendants received notice of the judgment on March 16, 1964 [1]. On March 30, 1964, fourteen (14) days after receiving the notice, the defendants filed a motion for extension of time to file a motion for reconsideration [1]. The City Court denied this motion on April 6, 1964, ruling it was filed "purely for delay" [2]. The defendants received the denial order on April 20, 1964, and filed their notice of appeal and appeal bond the following day, April 21, 1964 [2].

When the case was elevated to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the appeal for being filed beyond the 15-day reglementary period [3]. The CFI granted the motion and dismissed the appeal as having been perfected out of time [3]. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the validity of the dismissal order [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a motion for extension of time to file a motion for reconsideration suspends the running of the reglementary period for appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that a motion for extension of time within which to file a motion for reconsideration does not toll the reglementary period for perfecting an appeal [5, 6]. The Court reasoned that such a motion is a dilatory tactic; if a *pro forma* motion for reconsideration does not stop the running of the period for appeal, with greater reason should a motion merely to extend the period for filing one not suspend said period [6].

Citing *Garcia v. Buenaventura* and *Bello v. Fernando*, the Court emphasized that a movant has no right to assume that a motion for extension will be granted [7, 8]. The party should check with the court regarding the outcome of the motion so that, if denied, they can still perfect the appeal within the remaining time [8]. In this case, the defendants filed the motion for extension at the "eleventh hour" (one day before the expiry) and did nothing but wait, proceeding at their own risk [9]. Public policy demands that judgments become final at a definite date fixed by law [9].

The order of the Court of First Instance dismissing the appeal is affirmed [10].
