**I. CAPTION**
FORTUNATO HALILI v. MARIA LLORET and RICARDO GONZALES LLORET as Administrator of the Estate of the late FRANCISCO GONZALES, G.R. No. L-20218, August 8, 1967, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
This case involves the execution of a Supreme Court judgment promulgated on May 26, 1954 (G.R. No. L-6306), which ordered defendant Ricardo Gonzales Lloret to pay plaintiff Fortunato Halili "the sum of P100,000 which should be adjusted in accordance with the Ballantyne scale of values" [1]. The P100,000 represented a deposit made by Halili to Lloret in June 1944 for the purchase of land. When negotiations failed, Lloret attempted to return the money on August 2, 1944, but Halili's agent refused to accept it [2, 3]. Lloret failed to consign the amount in court [3].

In the execution proceedings, the parties disputed the applicable date for the Ballantyne Scale conversion. Halili argued for June 1944 (when he paid), while Lloret argued for January 1945 (when the value was lower) [2]. The trial court initially adopted the June 1944 rate but amended its order to apply the August 1944 rate [4]. Both parties appealed [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the conversion of the obligation into Philippine currency should be based on the Ballantyne Scale of Values as of August 1944.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court held that the conversion must be based on the value in August 1944. The Court reasoned that Lloret's duty to return the money and consign it in court arose when his offer to return the amount was rejected in August 1944 [5]. Since he failed to perform this duty, his liability attached at that specific time [5].

The Court rejected the June 1944 date because no liability had yet attached [5]. It also rejected the January 1945 date, ruling that it would be "unjust and inequitable" for the defendant to wait until the currency had depreciated further before making a consignation, especially since he is presumed to have benefited from the money in August 1944 [5]. The liability to be adjusted is the one that existed at the time the duty to consign arose [5].

The order appealed from is affirmed [6].
