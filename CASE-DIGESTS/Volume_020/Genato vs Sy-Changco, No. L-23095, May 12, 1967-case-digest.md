I. CAPTION
PEDRO D. GENATO v. FAUSTINO SY-CHANGCO and PEDRO GIMENEZ, G.R. No. L-23095, May 12, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pedro D. Genato, on behalf of himself and other employees of the Court of First Instance of Manila, filed an original action for mandamus to compel the Budget Commissioner and Auditor General to release P292,188 representing salary differentials for the fiscal year 1963-1964. These increases were authorized under Republic Act No. 3845 (General Appropriation Act). The petitioners alleged that upon the approval of the Act, the appropriation became automatically available. The respondents countered that the release of funds was not ministerial and depended on government income. Furthermore, the Executive Judge of the CFI had previously requested the release of these funds specifically so that "promotional appointments" could be issued to the employees, admitting that such appointments had not yet been made [1-5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N mandamus lies to compel the release of funds for salary increases authorized by an appropriation act when the employees have not yet received promotional appointments.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the petitioners have no cause of action for mandamus. The petitioners hold their positions under appointments that specify their current compensation, not the increased pay authorized by Republic Act No. 3845 [5]. To be entitled to the increased pay provided in the budget, it is necessary that they be extended promotional appointments [5, 6]. Since no such promotional appointments were issued, the petitioners are not yet legally entitled to the salary increases [7, 8]. Without a clear legal right to the funds, mandamus cannot issue.

The petition was **DISMISSED**, and the writ of preliminary injunction was dissolved [8].
