I. CAPTION
ELIAS GALLAR v. HERMENEGILDA HUSAIN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20954, May 24, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On January 9, 1919, Teodoro Husain sold a hectare of rice land in Iloilo to Serapio Chichirita for P30.00 with the right to repurchase within six years [1]. Teodoro failed to redeem the land. However, shortly after the sale, Chichirita transferred his right to Graciana Husain (Teodoro’s sister), who subsequently transferred her rights to Elias Gallar in exchange for a cow [2, 3]. Possession of the land and the owner's duplicate title were delivered to Gallar, who has possessed the land since 1919 [4].

In 1960, Gallar filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo to compel Hermenegilda and Bonifacio Husain (heirs of Teodoro) to execute a deed of conveyance so he could obtain a transfer certificate of title [5]. The heirs contended that the original transaction was a mortgage, not a sale, and that the action had prescribed [6]. The CFI ruled in favor of Gallar, ordering the heirs to execute the deed [7]. Bonifacio Husain appealed, raising a new issue regarding the identity of the land and insisting on the defense of prescription [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the transaction between Chichirita and Graciana was a redemption on behalf of the original vendor (Teodoro) or an acquisition of right.
2. W/N the action to compel the execution of a deed of conveyance (quieting of title) has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **NO** (It was not a redemption for the vendor). The Court held that unlike a debt which a third party may satisfy against the debtor's will, the right of repurchase may be exercised only by the vendor or his transferee [9]. Graciana acquired the land in her own right, subject only to Teodoro's right of redemption [9]. Upon Teodoro's failure to redeem within the stipulated period, ownership was consolidated in Gallar [10]. Although the sales were in a private instrument, they are valid, and delivery of possession consummated the sale [10].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the action is imprescriptible [10]. This action is not for specific performance but to quiet title and remove the cloud on Gallar's ownership [10]. Citing *Sapto v. Fabiana*, the Court established that an action to quiet title brought by a person in possession of the property does not prescribe [10]. Prescription would only apply if the plaintiff were not in possession, in which case the action would be for recovery of real property [10].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [11].
