I. CAPTION
VICENTE S. DEL ROSARIO, CEFERINA LLAMAS VDA. DE DEL ROSARIO, TERESITA REYES and DIOSDADO LARRAZABAL v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and THE PHILIPPINE LAND-AIR-SEA LABOR UNION (PLASLU), G.R. No. L-23133, July 13, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners owned and administered "Hacienda del Rosario," comprising 200 hectares of their own land and 107 leased hectares, devoted to large-scale sugar cane planting, processing, and milling [1]. On June 30, 1958, respondent union PLASLU filed a complaint for unfair labor practice against petitioners, alleging that 87 workers were dismissed due to their union membership [2]. Petitioners moved to dismiss, arguing the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) lacked jurisdiction over the agricultural enterprise. The CIR initially assumed jurisdiction over all workers. On motion for reconsideration, the CIR *en banc* modified the ruling based on the doctrine in *Victorias Milling Co. v. CIR*: it dismissed the complaint regarding pure "agricultural workers" (field laborers) but affirmed jurisdiction and ordered reinstatement for "industrial workers" (mill laborers, *trapicheros*, chemists, drivers, etc.) [3]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over the workers in the hacienda.
2. W/N the finding of unfair labor practice is supported by substantial evidence.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that within an hacienda, there may be both agricultural and industrial workers. While the Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction over agricultural laborers, the Court of Industrial Relations retains exclusive jurisdiction over industrial workers [4]. Citing *Pampanga Sugar Mills v. Pasumil Workers' Union* and *Victorias Milling Co. v. CIR*, the Court ruled that the nature of the work determines the classification [5]. Petitioners' operation was deemed a highly mechanized industrial concern because it utilized two mills, employed distinct field and mill workers, and maintained payrolls typical of industrial concerns. Therefore, workers engaged in milling, transporting cane, and operating machinery (e.g., mill laborers, fuelmen, tractor drivers) are industrial employees covered by the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. 875) [4, 6].

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed that findings of the CIR are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. The record showed substantial evidence that the workers were dismissed in March 1958 due to union membership [7]. The Court rejected petitioners' defenses that the workers resigned or were dismissed due to financial difficulties. Minor discrepancies in dates or the fact that some original complainants were found ineligible did not alter the validity of the findings regarding the illegally dismissed workers [7].

The decision and resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations were affirmed [8].
