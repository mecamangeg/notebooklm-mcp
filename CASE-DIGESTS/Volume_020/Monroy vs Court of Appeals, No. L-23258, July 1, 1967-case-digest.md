I. CAPTION
ROBERTO R. MONROY v. COURT OF APPEALS and FELIPE DEL ROSARIO, G.R. No. L-23258, July 1, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Monroy, the incumbent Mayor of Navotas, Rizal, filed his certificate of candidacy (COC) for Representative of the first district of Rizal on September 15, 1961. Three days later, on September 18, 1961, he filed a letter withdrawing said COC, which the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) approved. On September 21, 1961, Respondent Del Rosario, the Vice-Mayor, took his oath as Municipal Mayor, theorizing that Monroy had automatically forfeited the office upon filing his COC.

Monroy filed a suit for injunction. The Court of First Instance (CFI) ruled that Monroy ceased to be Mayor upon filing his COC on September 15, and Del Rosario became Mayor on September 21. The CFI also ordered Monroy to reimburse the salaries he received during the period he held office *de facto*. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the decision *in toto*, save for moral damages. Monroy appealed, arguing that the courts lacked jurisdiction to review COMELEC resolutions and that he should retain the salaries based on *Rodriguez v. Tan*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the courts have jurisdiction to determine the legal effect of the withdrawal of a certificate of candidacy.
2. W/N the withdrawal of a certificate of candidacy restores the elective official to the position he forfeited.
3. W/N a *de facto* officer must reimburse the salaries received to the *de jure* officer.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The issue is a purely legal dispute—whether Monroy was still Mayor after September 15, 1961—which falls within the cognizance of the courts. The COMELEC’s jurisdiction under the Constitution is limited to "administrative questions affecting elections" and the "conduct of elections." The question of Monroy's forfeiture has no bearing on the conduct of the congressional elections.

2. **NO.** Under Section 27 of the Revised Election Code, an elective official running for a different office is considered resigned from the moment of the filing of his COC. The forfeiture is automatic and irrevocably effective upon the *act* and *moment* of filing. Withdrawal of the COC does not restore the ousted official, as the position is forfeited forever, subject only to a new election or appointment.

3. **YES.** The rightful incumbent (*de jure* officer) may recover from the *de facto* officer the salary received by the latter during the wrongful tenure. Possession of title to the office is decisive. The Court distinguished this from *Rodriguez v. Tan* (91 Phil. 724), which involved a proclaimed official later ousted in an election contest. Here, the forfeiture was automatic by operation of law.

The petition is **DENIED** and the judgment is **AFFIRMED**.
