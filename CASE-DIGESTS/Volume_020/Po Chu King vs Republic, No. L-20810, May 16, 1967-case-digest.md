I. CAPTION
ALFONSO PO CHU KING v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20810, May 16, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alfonso Po Chu King, a citizen of Nationalist China, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental. He claimed exemption from filing a declaration of intention, alleging he was born in Iligan City and completed his education in the Philippines [1, 2]. He reported an annual income of roughly P2,814.74, which included a P1,000 bonus [3]. He presented two character witnesses, Maximo Lago and Filemon Tan, to support his petition [4]. The trial court granted the petition, finding him qualified [4]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that the petitioner was not exempt from filing a declaration of intention, lacked lucrative income, and presented insufficient character witness testimony [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a declaration of intention.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or profession.
3. W/N the character witnesses’ testimony was sufficient to support the petition.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petitioner failed to mention the primary schools he attended in his petition and did not prove that the schools he attended (Ozamis Chinese School and Hope Christian High School) were recognized by the Government and not limited to any race or nationality [6, 7]. Under Sections 5 and 6 of the Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473), the burden is on the applicant to prove that the schools are not limited to a specific nationality to qualify for exemption [8]. Furthermore, the petitioner failed to prove he was born in the Philippines; the affidavits of his mother and brother were hearsay as they did not take the witness stand, and he failed to explain the absence of his birth certificate [9].

2. **NO.** The petitioner's net income of P2,814.74 included a P1,000 bonus [3]. The Court held that contingent income, such as bonuses and commissions, does not constitute dependable remuneration for determining lucrative trade or work because they are indefinite and unsteady [3]. Excluding the bonus, his annual salary of P1,814.74 is not considered lucrative, even if he is single [3].

3. **NO.** The character witnesses merely reiterated the contents of their joint affidavit and provided conclusions that the petitioner would make a "good citizen" without citing specific facts or instances to support their belief [10]. Such opinions, unsupported by facts, are entitled to no weight (*Santiago Ngo v. Republic*) [11].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DENIED** [11].
