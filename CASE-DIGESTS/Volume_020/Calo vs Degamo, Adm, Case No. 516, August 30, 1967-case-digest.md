I. CAPTION
TRANQUILINO O. CALO, JR. v. ESTEBAN DEGAMO, Adm. Case No. 516, August 30, 1967, 20 SCRA 1162, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In a previous decision dated June 27, 1967, the Supreme Court ordered the disbarment of Respondent Esteban Degamo. Degamo filed a verified motion for reconsideration, arguing that the penalty was excessively severe. He disclosed new facts highlighting his public service: he served as Chief of Police of Carmen, Agusan (January 17, 1959 to May 17, 1959), Mayor of Carmen (1960-1964), and Election Registrar (1965) [1, 2]. Although he admitted to failing to disclose pending charges against him when he applied for the Chief of Police position, he asserted that he had served honestly and efficiently in all these offices and that no complaint had been filed against his official actuations [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the penalty of disbarment should be modified or reduced based on the respondent's public service record.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court found that the original sanction of disbarment appeared too harsh given the new facts presented. The Court considered the respondent's honest and efficient service as Chief of Police, Mayor, and Election Registrar, noting the absence of complaints regarding his official duties [2]. Citing *Macale vs. Gan* (93 Phil. 292), the Court held that a suspension would be adequate to the merits of the case and serve as a sufficient warning to other members of the bar [2].

The previous decision was modified, and Respondent Esteban Degamo was **SUSPENDED** from the practice of law for three (3) years [3].
