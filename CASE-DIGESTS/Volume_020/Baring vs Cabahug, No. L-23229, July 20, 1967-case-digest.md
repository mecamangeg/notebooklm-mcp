I. CAPTION
ANDRES P. BARING v. CESAR M. CABAHUG, G.R. No. L-23229, July 20, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J. [1-3]

II. FACTS
On June 26, 1960, Baring (lessor) and Cabahug (lessee) entered into a lease contract for a lot in Opon, Cebu. After making initial payments, Cabahug failed to pay subsequent rentals despite receiving two demand letters. Baring filed a suit for specific performance in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu. Cabahug answered, counterclaiming for rescission due to alleged non-delivery of the lot.

During the trial proceedings, the hearing was reset to March 26, 1963, and notice was personally received by Cabahug's counsel. However, neither Cabahug nor his counsel appeared on said date. Consequently, the CFI allowed Baring to present evidence and rendered a decision ordering Cabahug to pay rentals and fees. Cabahug moved for a new trial, arguing "excusable negligence" because his counsel's clerk forgot to note the trial date in the calendar and lost the notice. The CFI denied the motion. [3-8]

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure of the counsel's clerk to note the trial date constitutes excusable negligence sufficient to grant a new trial.
2. W/N the defense of non-delivery of the lot justifies reopening the case.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the circumstances did not constitute excusable negligence under Section 1, Rule 37 of the Rules of Court. The counsel personally received the notice and was inexcusably negligent in failing to note the date himself. The Court held that delegating the task to a clerk who forgets or loses the notice is not an excuse; it is the duty of counsel to adopt and strictly maintain a system that efficiently takes into account all court notices sent to him. [8, 9]

2. **NO.** The Court found that the defense in the affidavit of merits did not deserve a reopening of the case. Cabahug's claim of non-delivery was belied by the fact that he made initial rental payments totaling P450.00 and remained silent regarding the alleged non-delivery for over a year and nine months, despite receiving demand letters from the plaintiff. [10]

The Order of the lower court is affirmed. [1]
