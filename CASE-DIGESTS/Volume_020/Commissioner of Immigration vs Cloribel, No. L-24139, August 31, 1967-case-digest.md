I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION v. HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch VI, MERCEDES TOBIANO CO, JOSE TOBIANO and JUSTO TOBIANO, G.R. No. L-24139, August 31, 1967, 20 SCRA 1241, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On September 27, 1962, the Board of Commissioners of Immigration issued a decision and warrant of exclusion against respondents Mercedes Tobiano Co and her children, Jose and Justo Tobiano, as undocumented aliens [1]. Consequently, two cases were filed in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila presided by Respondent Judge Cloribel: Civil Case No. 58624 (certiorari to annul the Board's decision) and Civil Case No. 58782 (habeas corpus) [2].

On February 5, 1965, Judge Cloribel granted bail and ordered the release of Jose and Justo Tobiano in the habeas corpus case [3]. The Commissioner of Immigration filed a petition with the Supreme Court, which issued a writ of preliminary injunction on February 10, 1965 [3, 4]. The writ enjoined Judge Cloribel from enforcing the release order and from "taking cognizance of or in any manner assuming jurisdiction or [conducting] further proceedings" in Case No. 58782 [4]. On August 27, 1965, the Supreme Court amended the injunction solely to permit the Judge to grant bail at a higher amount, subject to the litigation's outcome [5].

Despite the standing injunction, Judge Cloribel promulgated a joint decision on January 6, 1967, declaring the Board's exclusion order void and ruling that the respondents were Filipino citizens entitled to remain in the country [6, 7]. The Solicitor General moved to declare Judge Cloribel in contempt. The Judge argued that the Supreme Court's August 27 resolution granting bail rendered the February 10 injunction *functus officio* [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent Judge is guilty of indirect contempt for disregarding the Supreme Court's injunction.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court found Judge Cloribel guilty of indirect contempt [8].

The February 10, 1965 injunction contained two distinct prohibitions: (1) enforcing the February 5 release orders, and (2) taking further cognizance or assuming jurisdiction over the habeas corpus case [9]. The amendatory resolution of August 27, 1965 only modified the first prohibition to allow bail; it did not lift the prohibition against deciding the case [10]. By rendering a decision on the merits declaring the Tobianos as citizens, the Judge committed "open defiance" of the Court's directive [11]. The Court characterized the Judge's defense as a "subtle attempt... to sidetrack the injunction" and noted that violation by subterfuge is as much contempt as direct violation [11].

Under Section 3(b), Rule 71 of the Rules of Court, disobedience of a lawful writ or injunction constitutes indirect contempt [12, 13]. Contempt is a willful disregard or disobedience of the court's authority [13]. Applying the preservative principle in exercising the power to punish contempt, the Court sentenced Judge Gaudencio Cloribel to pay a fine of P100 [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
The decision was unanimous, with Concepcion, C.J., and Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurring [14].
