I. CAPTION
PETRA HAWPIA v. COURT OF APPEALS and AURELIA ALTEA, G.R. No. L-20047, June 30, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Petra Hawpia originally purchased Lot No. 8610 from Valeriano Neala in 1932 with a right of repurchase and secured a title in 1937 [1]. However, Neala’s right to repurchase was levied upon and sold at public auction to Respondent Aurelia Altea, the Filipina common-law wife of Jose Escasa, a Chinese national [2]. Altea successfully petitioned for the reopening of Hawpia's decree, resulting in the cancellation of Hawpia's title and the issuance of a new title to Altea, a decision previously affirmed by the Supreme Court [3].

Years later, during a domestic dispute, Escasa sued Altea alleging he was the real buyer of their properties but placed them in her name to circumvent the constitutional prohibition against alien land ownership [4, 5]. Altea admitted this in a "Salaysay" to settle the case, and the court declared the properties belonged to their children [6, 7]. Relying on this admission, Hawpia filed the present action for reconveyance, claiming Altea was a mere dummy for an alien and the sale was void [8]. The trial court dismissed the complaint. The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal and awarded damages to Altea, citing Hawpia's history of filing multiple baseless suits [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the sale to Altea is void for violating the constitutional prohibition against alien land ownership.
2. W/N the award of damages and attorney's fees against the petitioner is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the factual finding of the Court of Appeals that the petitioner failed to prove by substantial evidence that the land was actually purchased by the Chinese common-law husband or that the transfer to their children was a subterfuge [10, 11]. Furthermore, the validity of Altea's ownership was already settled in the previous cadastral proceedings which were affirmed by the Supreme Court (G.R. Nos. 48209 & L-952). The holding that the land belonged to Altea, a Filipino citizen, is *res judicata* and cannot be disturbed [10, 12, 13].

2. **YES.** The Court upheld the award of P13,000.00 in actual and moral damages and P4,000.00 in attorney's fees [14]. The record revealed that the petitioner, with "blind persistence," filed case after case against the respondent, none of which prospered [15, 16]. This malicious prosecution harassed and embarrassed the respondent, causing her actual damages and moral suffering [12, 16].

Judgment affirmed.
