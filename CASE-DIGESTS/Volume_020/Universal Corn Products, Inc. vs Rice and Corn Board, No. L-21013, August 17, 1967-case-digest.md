I. CAPTION
**UNIVERSAL CORN PRODUCTS, INC. v. RICE AND CORN BOARD**, G.R. No. L-21013, August 17, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Universal Corn Products, Inc., a corporation wholly owned by Filipinos, employed co-petitioners (aliens) in various non-technical positions such as executive vice-president and comptroller prior to the enactment of Republic Act No. 3018 [1]. The Rice and Corn Board (RICOB) issued Resolution No. 10 pursuant to Section 6 of said Act, prohibiting the employment of non-citizens in any capacity in Filipino-owned establishments engaged in the rice and corn industry, except for authorized technical personnel [1]. Petitioners filed a petition for declaratory relief in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, arguing that the resolution was unconstitutional and that its application to aliens already employed before the law's passage constituted an invalid retroactive application [2], [1]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling in favor of the RICOB [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Resolution No. 10 constitutes an invalid retroactive application of Republic Act No. 3018.
2. W/N Resolution No. 10 is constitutional.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The application of the law is not retroactive. While statutes are generally construed to operate prospectively unless a contrary intent is manifest, the law in question took effect on January 1, 1961, well after its approval in August 1960 [3], [4]. The law does not penalize the employment of aliens prior to its approval; rather, it penalizes the continuance of such employment *after* the law became effective [5]. Contracts of employment entered into prior to the passage of the law must yield to the police power of the State and become legally impossible of performance once the acts are declared unlawful [6], [5].

2. **YES.** The regulation is constitutional as a valid exercise of police power [7]. The Court held that the nationalization of employment in the rice and corn industry does not deprive citizens of rights but promotes and protects their welfare and economic security [7], [8]. Citing *King v. Hernaez*, the Court reiterated that nationalization measures founded on public policy to remove foreign economic control are not unjust, arbitrary, or oppressive, and apply equally to the nationalization of employment [9].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
