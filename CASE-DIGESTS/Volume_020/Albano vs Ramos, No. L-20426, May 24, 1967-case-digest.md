I. CAPTION
MIGUEL ALBANO, et al. v. FERMIN RAMOS, et al. (PERPETUA DE COLOMA, Petitioner-Appellee), G.R. No. L-20426, May 24, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner-Appellee Atty. Perpetua D. Coloma represented Plaintiffs-Appellants Miguel Albano, et al. in Civil Case No. 4147 against Defendants Fermin Ramos, et al. Her legal fees were contingent: one-third (1/3) of all lands and damages awarded to her clients, and nothing if the case was lost [1]. After obtaining a favorable judgment, Coloma moved for execution to satisfy her fees. On October 4, 1957, the trial court issued an order directing the plaintiffs to: (1) pay Coloma P5,669.80 as her lien on damages, or the excess collected; and (2) segregate the 1/3 portion of the lands won for Coloma, appointing commissioners for partition if necessary [2]. The trial court found that plaintiffs had already collected P13,624.80 of the P17,008.60 total damages [3]. Plaintiffs-Appellants appealed, arguing the computation was erroneous, the order was vague, and the court erred in ordering the partition of lands in the same case [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in ordering the partition of the adjudicated lands to segregate the lawyer’s 1/3 share in the main case.
2. W/N the trial court's order regarding the payment of the lawyer's share in the damages was proper and executable.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the trial court erred because the issue was already settled. The Court of Appeals, in a decision dated August 30, 1965, had already affirmed a previous order stating that the recovery of Coloma's share in the lands must be the subject of a separate action [4]. Consequently, the trial court could not order partition in the main case to satisfy the attorney's fees regarding the real property.

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court found the trial court's order regarding the cash damages vague, indefinite, and incapable of execution [5]. It failed to specify whether execution should issue against the plaintiffs for the full fee or split between plaintiffs and defendants, creating an inequitable situation for both parties [5]. Applying principles of equity and contract, the Court ruled that plaintiffs must pay Coloma 1/3 of the amount they actually collected (1/3 of P13,624.80 = P4,541.60) [6]. Coloma is entitled to 1/3 of any future collections, which she may pursue against the defendants via execution on the judgment, as her claim constitutes a lien [6].

The order appealed from was **REVERSED and SET ASIDE** insofar as it directed the partition of lands (without prejudice to a separate action), and **MODIFIED** regarding the payment of damages as computed [7].
