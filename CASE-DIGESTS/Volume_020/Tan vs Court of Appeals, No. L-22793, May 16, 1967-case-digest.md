**I. CAPTION**
CARMELITA TAN and RODOLFO TAN v. COURT OF APPEALS and FRANCISCO TAN, G.R. No. L-22793, May 16, 1967, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners Carmelita and Rodolfo Tan, represented by their mother Celestina Daldo, filed a suit for acknowledgment and support against respondent Francisco Tan in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila (Civil Case 26909). After presenting oral and documentary evidence, Celestina moved to dismiss the case, admitting in an affidavit that Francisco was not the children's father. The CFI dismissed the case with prejudice.

Later, petitioners, represented by their grandfather, filed a new action in the Juvenile & Domestic Relations Court (Civil Case 00855). The court initially dismissed the case on the ground of *res judicata* and insufficiency of evidence but later reconsidered, declaring petitioners as illegitimate children of Francisco and ordering support. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed this decision and dismissed the complaint. The CA ruled that the testimonies of petitioners' witnesses from the first case (Exhibits H and I) were inadmissible because the witnesses were available but merely refused to testify, and that the remaining evidence was insufficient to prove paternity. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the testimony of witnesses in a former trial is admissible under the rule on "inability to testify" when said witnesses are available but refuse to appear.
2. W/N the factual findings of the Court of Appeals are binding on the Supreme Court.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that "unable to testify" under Section 41, Rule 130 (formerly Section 37, Rule 123) of the Rules of Court does not cover witnesses who were subpoenaed but failed to appear. The phrase refers to a specific inability proceeding from a grave cause, almost amounting to death, such as when a witness is old or has lost the power of speech. In this case, the witnesses were available but simply refused to testify. The proper remedy for the petitioners was to urge the court to have the witnesses arrested and punished for contempt to compel their appearance, which they failed to do.

2. **YES.** Under Section 2, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, an appeal by certiorari from a judgment of the Court of Appeals allows only questions of law to be raised. The CA's judgment is conclusive as to the facts, and the Supreme Court is bound by the CA's finding that the petitioners failed to prove paternity by clear and convincing evidence.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.
