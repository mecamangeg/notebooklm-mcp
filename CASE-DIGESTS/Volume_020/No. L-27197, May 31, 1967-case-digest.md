**I. CAPTION**
NATIONAL WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY v. THE MUNICIPALITY OF LIBMANAN and THE PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH FIVE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF CAMARINES SUR, G.R. No. L-27197, May 31, 1967, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) filed an original action for certiorari and mandamus against the Municipality of Libmanan and the Presiding Judge of the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur [1]. The petition sought to enjoin the respondent court from executing its decision dated December 10, 1965, in Civil Case No. L-161, a case filed by the respondent municipality for recovery of property with damages [2, 3]. NAWASA also prayed for an order commanding the lower court to approve either its original or amended Record on Appeal [2, 4]. However, while the petition referred to the complaint, the decision, the order of default, and the record on appeal, NAWASA failed to attach copies of these documents to its petition [2-4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petition for certiorari and mandamus should be dismissed for failure to attach copies of the relevant pleadings and orders.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that the petition must be dismissed because the petitioner failed to attach the complaint, order of default, decision, and record on appeal mentioned therein [5]. The Court reasoned that since the purpose of the petition was to enjoin the execution of the decision in Civil Case No. L-161 and to secure an order approving the record on appeal, the "importance of the missing pleadings is obvious" [3, 4]. Without these documents, the Court could not grant the relief sought. Consequently, the petition was dismissed [4].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Concepcion (C.J.), J.B.L. Reyes, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Castro concurred [4]. Justice Sanchez took no part [4].
