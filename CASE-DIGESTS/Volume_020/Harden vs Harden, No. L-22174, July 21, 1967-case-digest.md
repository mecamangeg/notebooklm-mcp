I. CAPTION
ESPERANZA P. DE HARDEN v. FRED M. HARDEN, et al. (AURORA R. DE RECTO v. JOSE SALUMBIDES), G.R. No. L-22174, July 21, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Esperanza P. de Harden engaged Claro M. Recto to represent her in an action for administration and accounting of conjugal properties against her husband, Fred Harden, and his attorney-in-fact, Jose Salumbides [1]. The contract provided Recto a contingent fee of 20% of her share [1]. The lower court ruled in favor of Mrs. Harden [1]. Subsequently, the spouses settled amicably, and Recto intervened to enforce his charging lien for attorney's fees [2]. The Supreme Court upheld Recto’s lien [2].

To satisfy the judgment balance for fees, Recto’s estate (substituted after his death) sought to recover cash dividends on Surigao Consolidated Mining Co. shares [3, 4]. These shares, though registered to Salumbides, were declared conjugal property [3]. Salumbides had received dividends on these shares from 1950 to 1955 but refused to turn them over [5, 6]. The lower court ordered Salumbides to deposit the amount to satisfy the remaining balance of Recto's fees [5]. Salumbides appealed, arguing that the claim was barred by prescription and laches, and that since Fred Harden died in 1959, the claim should be filed in the administration proceedings of his estate [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claim for attorney's fees was extinguished by the husband's death and must be filed in the estate administration proceedings.
2. W/N the claim for the dividends is barred by prescription or laches.
3. W/N Salumbides acquired the dividends by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that a claim for attorney's fees against the wife is not a money claim against the husband, and thus the latter's death did not extinguish it [8]. Furthermore, a charging lien established on the property in litigation to secure attorney's fees partakes of the nature of a collateral security or a lien on property [8]. Its enforcement need not be made in the administration proceedings of the decedent's estate [8].

2. **NO.** The prescriptive period was seasonably interrupted by written extrajudicial demands (letters from the receiver) and judicial demands (motions filed by the claimant) [9]. These demands also negated laches on the part of the claimant [9].

3. **NO.** Salumbides could not acquire the dividends by prescription because he possessed them not in the concept of an owner (*concepto de dueño*), but as an agent (attorney-in-fact) of the true owner, Mr. Harden [10]. Possession as an agent does not ripen into ownership by prescription [10].

**Disposition:** Order affirmed [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
