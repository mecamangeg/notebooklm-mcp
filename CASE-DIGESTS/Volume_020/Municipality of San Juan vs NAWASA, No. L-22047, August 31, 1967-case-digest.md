I. CAPTION
MUNICIPALITY OF SAN JUAN v. NATIONAL WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY, G.R. No. L-22047, August 31, 1967, 20 SCRA 1210, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Municipality of San Juan, Batangas, constructed a waterworks system using local and loan funds. In December 1955, the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) assumed control of the system pursuant to Republic Act No. 1383. The Municipality filed a suit to declare the Act unconstitutional for depriving it of property without due process and just compensation. The Court of First Instance of Lipa City ruled in favor of the Municipality, declaring it the owner and ordering NAWASA to return the system and render an accounting, or alternatively, to pay the system's value of P101,030.02. NAWASA appealed, arguing that R.A. 1383 was a valid exercise of police power as it merely transferred possession, administration, and control, not ownership.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N R.A. 1383 constitutes a valid exercise of police power in transferring the administration and control of the municipal waterworks to NAWASA.
2. W/N the lower court's judgment granting NAWASA an alternative option to pay without fixing a specific period is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court rejected NAWASA's distinction between ownership and administration. Citing *Municipality of La Carlota v. NAWASA* [1] and *Municipality of Naguilian v. NAWASA* [2], the Court held that vesting jurisdiction, supervision, and control in NAWASA destroys the integrity of the municipality's right of dominion, as ownership is nothing without the inherent rights of possession and enjoyment [3]. The National Government cannot appropriate patrimonial property of municipal corporations without just compensation and due process of law (*City of Baguio v. NAWASA*; *Municipality of Compostela v. NAWASA*) [4], [5].

2. **NO.** A judgment granting an option to pay a certain sum without fixing the period within which it may be availed of may never become final and executory (*Ignacio v. Hilario*) [6]. The Court ruled that the decision must specify the time for the option to be exercised.

The decision was **MODIFIED** to grant NAWASA a period of six (6) months from entry of judgment to exercise the option to pay, and **AFFIRMED** in all other respects [6], [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred with the decision [7].
