I. CAPTION
RIZAL SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY v. COURT OF APPEALS and UNITED STATES LINES COMPANY, G.R. No. L-23729, May 16, 1967, 20 SCRA 61, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Rizal Surety insured a shipment of cotton remnants consigned to Imperial Shirt Factory, loaded on a vessel owned by United States Lines (U.S. Lines). Upon arrival in Manila and discharge to the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service (MPS), four bales were found missing. Rizal Surety paid the consignee for the loss and sought reimbursement from both MPS and U.S. Lines. MPS stated the claim was under consideration, while U.S. Lines denied liability, presenting verifax copies of tally sheets showing the goods were discharged in good order. Due to the uncertainty of who was liable, Rizal Surety filed a complaint impleading both MPS and U.S. Lines as alternative defendants.

During pendency, MPS paid the claim, leading to the dismissal of the complaint. However, the trial court proceeded with U.S. Lines' counterclaim and awarded it attorney's fees, ruling that Rizal Surety "unnecessarily dragged" U.S. Lines into the suit by failing to confront MPS with the tally sheets. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding the suit against U.S. Lines was "clearly unfounded."

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Rizal Surety is liable for attorney's fees for unnecessarily impleading U.S. Lines as a defendant.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the decision. Under Article 2208 of the Civil Code, for a defendant to recover attorney's fees on the ground of being "unnecessarily" impleaded, the action must be "clearly unfounded," which implies gross and evident bad faith. The Court held that Rizal Surety properly exercised its right to sue alternative defendants under Section 13, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court because of the uncertainty regarding liability.

Rizal Surety was not bound to blindly accept the verifax copies of tally sheets presented by U.S. Lines, as these were not the best evidence and did not automatically bind the arrastre operator. It was not the insurer's duty to establish U.S. Lines' defense; rather, it was incumbent upon U.S. Lines to convince the MPS of its non-liability. Since neither party admitted liability initially, the suit was not clearly unfounded. The award of attorney's fees was erroneous because the mere fact that a defendant wins does not automatically entitle them to fees; otherwise, it would put a premium on the right to litigate.

Petition granted. Decision reversed.
