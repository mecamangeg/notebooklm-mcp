I. CAPTION
**DOMINGO BAUTISTA v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, PHILIPPINE READY-MIXED CONCRETE CO., INC., and CENTRAL SURETY & INSURANCE CO.**, G.R. No. L-22710, June 30, 1967, 20 SCRA 576, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Philippine Ready-Mixed Concrete Co., Inc. (Prmcci) had government road-building contracts, including Highway 54. To secure performance and payment for materials under Act 3688, Prmcci and Central Surety & Insurance Co. (Central) executed a performance bond. Domingo Bautista supplied sand and gravel to Prmcci.

On January 31, 1952, Bautista filed Civil Case No. 1636 against Prmcci for unpaid materials delivered from September 1951 to January 26, 1952. The parties entered into a judicial compromise wherein Prmcci acknowledged a consolidated debt of P104,000 for all materials supplied to various projects. This amount was fully paid via Bureau of Public Works checks.

Later, on October 3, 1952, Bautista filed Civil Case No. 1888 (the present case) against Prmcci and Central to enforce the bond for an alleged balance of P48,807.74 for Highway 54 materials. Of this amount, P40,795.15 represented materials delivered prior to January 26, 1952—the same period covered by the compromise in Civil Case No. 1636. Bautista attempted to re-apply the payments received under the compromise to other projects first, claiming the Highway 54 account remained unpaid to pursue the bond.

The trial court ruled in favor of Bautista for the full amount. The Court of Appeals modified the judgment, allowing only P8,012.59 (for deliveries after the compromise) and disallowing the P40,795.15 because it was already settled in Civil Case No. 1636. Bautista appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Bautista can recover the P40,795.15 against the surety bond despite the previous judicial compromise and payment in Civil Case No. 1636.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that Bautista cannot recover the amount as the obligation had been extinguished.

The judicial compromise in Civil Case No. 1636 consolidated Prmcci’s various obligations into a single sum of P104,000, without breaking down which amount pertained to which project. This consolidated obligation was fully paid. Bautista cannot unilaterally change the application of payments after the fact to revive an obligation that had already been legally extinguished.

Furthermore, under **Article 1217 of the Civil Code**, payment made by one of the solidary debtors extinguishes the obligation. Since Prmcci (the principal) had already paid the amount covering the claim, the liability of Central (the surety) under the performance bond is also extinguished. The Court emphasized the principle of *non quieta movere*—what was effectively concluded by the final judgment in the compromise cannot be undone.

The petition is **DENIED**, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
