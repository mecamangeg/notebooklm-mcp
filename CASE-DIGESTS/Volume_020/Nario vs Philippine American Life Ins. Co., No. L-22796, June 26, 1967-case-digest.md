I. CAPTION
DELFIN NARIO and ALEJANDRA SANTOS-NARIO v. THE PHILIPPINE AMERICAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, G.R. No. L-22796, June 26, 1967, 20 SCRA 434, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Mrs. Alejandra Santos-Nario obtained a life insurance policy with a face value of P5,000.00 from the Philippine American Life Insurance Company (Philam Life). She designated her husband, Delfin Nario, and their unemancipated minor son, Ernesto, as irrevocable beneficiaries. Mrs. Nario later applied for a policy loan and subsequently tried to surrender the policy for its cash value. The applications were signed by Delfin Nario as beneficiary and as the legal administrator/guardian of his minor son.

Philam Life denied both requests, arguing that the written consent of the father-guardian was insufficient without court authorization because the transactions involved the disposition or alienation of the minor's property rights. The Narios filed a suit to compel the insurer to accept the applications. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that the minor’s vested interest required judicial authority for disposition. The Narios appealed, arguing the minor's interest was less than P2,000.00 (based on cash surrender value), thus exempting the father from filing a bond or securing a court appointment under the Rules of Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a father can validly consent to a policy loan or surrender of an insurance policy, in which his minor child is an irrevocable beneficiary, without judicial authorization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal.

First, the Court held that the minor's vested interest in the policy should be measured by its **full face value** (P5,000.00), not its cash surrender value. Since the minor's share (P2,500.00) exceeded P2,000.00, the father was required to file a guardianship bond and secure court appointment under **Articles 320 and 326 of the Civil Code** and **Rule 93, Section 7 of the Revised Rules of Court**. Without such bond and appointment, he could not exercise powers over the child's property.

Second, even if the minor's interest were less than P2,000.00, the result would be the same. As legal administrator, a parent's power is limited to **acts of management or administration**. A policy loan or surrender constitutes an **act of disposition or encumbrance** (alienation) of the minor's property rights. By analogy to the law on Agency (**Articles 1877 and 1878, Civil Code**), a general power of administration does not include the authority to borrow money or dispose of property; special authority (in this case, judicial authorization) is required. The New Civil Code does not authorize parents to alienate their child's property (real or personal) without court approval.

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
