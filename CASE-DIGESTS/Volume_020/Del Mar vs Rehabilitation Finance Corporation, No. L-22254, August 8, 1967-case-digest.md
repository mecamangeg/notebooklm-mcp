I. CAPTION
QUIRICO DEL MAR v. REHABILITATION FINANCE CORPORATION (now DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES), G.R. No. L-22254, August 8, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Quirico del Mar had an outstanding loan obligation of P4,423.04 with respondent Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC) [1]. He offered to pay the loan using his backpay acknowledgment certificate under Republic Act No. 897 [1]. RFC initially refused, but a prior court judgment (Civil Case No. R-5324) ordered it to accept the certificate [1].

Upon acceptance, RFC imposed a discount of 2% per annum on the certificate because it had 315 months remaining before its 30-year maturity date [2]. Consequently, P9,311.66 from the certificate was required to cover the P4,423.04 debt [2]. Del Mar filed a new suit (Civil Case No. R-6455) claiming RFC was barred from imposing the discount by the Omnibus Motion rule (as it was not raised in the first suit) and arguing for legal compensation [3, 4]. The lower court dismissed the petition, upholding the discount [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N RFC is barred by the Omnibus Motion rule from imposing the discount.
2. W/N RFC is authorized by law to deduct a discount from the backpay certificate.
3. W/N legal compensation applies to extinguish the debt without discount.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Omnibus Motion rule (Rules of Court, Rule 15, Sec. 8) does not bar the claim because the right to charge a discount was not at issue in the first suit [3]. The prior case only determined the duty of RFC to accept the certificate, while the validity of the discount was only raised in the present case [3].

2. **YES.** Republic Act No. 897, amending Republic Act No. 304, explicitly states that "no certificate shall be transferred or ceded by indorsement... at a discount rate exceeding two per centum per annum" [5, 6]. The discount is valid because the certificate is not yet due and payable; it only matures 30 years from issuance [7]. Since the transaction involves an indorsement before maturity rather than redemption at maturity, the certificate is not yet worth its full face value [7].

3. **NO.** Under Article 1279 of the Civil Code, legal compensation requires that both debts be due [4]. Here, Del Mar's debt to RFC is due, but the Government's obligation to redeem the backpay certificate is not yet due until the 30-year term expires [4].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [4].
