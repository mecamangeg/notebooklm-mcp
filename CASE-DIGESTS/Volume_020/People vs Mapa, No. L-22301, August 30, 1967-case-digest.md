I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MARIO MAPA Y MAPULONG, G.R. No. L-22301, August 30, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On August 13, 1962, Mario Mapa was apprehended in Manila possessing a home-made .22 caliber revolver ("paltik") and ammunition without a license [1, 2]. He was charged with illegal possession of firearms under the Revised Administrative Code [1]. During the trial, Mapa admitted to the possession and lack of license but presented evidence that he was a duly appointed "secret agent" of Batangas Governor Feliciano Leviste [2, 3]. He argued that as a secret agent, he was exempt from the license requirement [2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila convicted him [4]. Mapa appealed directly to the Supreme Court on a question of law, relying on the earlier ruling in *People v. Macarandang* which had acquitted a secret agent [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a secret agent of a provincial governor is exempt from the requirement of having a license for his firearm.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The law is explicit and contains no provision exempting secret agents [6]. Section 878 of the Revised Administrative Code prohibits the possession of firearms without a license, while Section 879 specifically lists the officials (e.g., members of the PNP, municipal mayors, provincial governors) who are exempt when using firearms in the performance of official duties [4]. Secret agents are not included in this specific enumeration [6].

The Court held that the first and fundamental duty of courts is to apply the law, and "construction and interpretation come only after it has been demonstrated that application is impossible or inadequate without them" [6]. Consequently, the Court declared that the doctrine in *People v. Macarandang* is no longer authoritative insofar as it conflicts with this decision [5]. The judgment of conviction was affirmed [7].
