I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. CHUA BENG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21755, May 13, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Chua Beng filed a petition for naturalization, which the Court of First Instance of Manila granted [1, 2]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing the petition should have been dismissed due to issues with the character witnesses and the petitioner's language proficiency [2].

Regarding the witnesses, Atty. Hermenegildo V. Lopez claimed he met the petitioner in 1946 at a lumber company in Manila to buy lumber. However, facts showed the petitioner resided in Laguna at that time, only moved to Manila in 1947, and worked as a mechanic, not in sales [3]. Another witness, Anastacio S. Bagaporo, claimed to have met the petitioner's father in Manila, but the father had died in China in 1938 [4].

Regarding language proficiency, the petitioner was initially unable to write in English or Tagalog during trial. His counsel requested a continuance due to alleged "nervousness" [5]. Upon resuming over a month later, the petitioner wrote a dictated paragraph perfectly. However, when the government counsel asked him to write and translate the simple sentence "the sun is shining and the weather is fine" on the spot, he wrote meaningless gibberish ("Thae sun is sring' and the wht feru") [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the character witnesses were "credible persons" as required by the Naturalization Law.
2. W/N the petitioner met the language qualifications (ability to speak and write English/Spanish and a principal Philippine language).

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The character witnesses failed to meet the conditions essential to be "credible persons" under Section 7 of the Naturalization Law. As elucidated in *Ong v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-10642), a credible person must not only have a clean record but must offer testimony that is not incredible [8, 9]. The inconsistencies and falsehoods regarding their meetings with the petitioner and his deceased relatives cast doubt on their veracity and the credibility of their testimony [3, 5].

2. **NO.** The petitioner failed to prove he could speak and write English and Tagalog as required by Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 [10]. The trial court noted that his ability to write the sample given by his counsel after a month-long continuance was likely the result of drilling and memorization [7]. His inability to write or translate a simple impromptu sentence demonstrated that he did not sufficiently know the languages [10].

The decision appealed from is REVERSED and the petition is DISMISSED [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred. Justice Castro did not take part [11].
