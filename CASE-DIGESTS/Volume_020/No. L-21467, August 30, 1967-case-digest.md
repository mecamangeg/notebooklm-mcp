I. CAPTION
RIO Y COMPANIA v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, VIVENCIO SOLIS and REMEDIOS M. SOLIS, G.R. No. L-21467, August 30, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On August 20, 1959, the M/V Pilar II, owned and operated by petitioner Rio y Compania, sank off Cabuli Island due to a typhoon [1]. Virgilio Solis was among those reported dead, though his body was never recovered [1]. On November 18, 1960, his father, Vivencio Solis (later joined by the mother, Remedios), filed a claim for death compensation [1]. The petitioner denied liability, arguing Virgilio was not an employee and was not on board [1].

The Hearing Officer dismissed the claim, finding no employer-employee relationship [2]. However, the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed this decision, finding that Virgilio was an "apprentice-mate" based on the "Coasting Manifest" signed under oath by the Captain, even though his name did not appear in the "Shipping Articles" [2], [3]. The petitioner subsequently filed a motion for review, raising for the first time the defense of prescription, arguing the claim was filed beyond the three-month period prescribed by law [2]. The WCC *en banc* denied the motion [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N there existed an employer-employee relationship between the petitioner and the deceased Virgilio Solis.
2. W/N the claim for compensation is barred by prescription under Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the WCC's finding that Virgilio Solis was an employee (apprentice-mate). While his name did not appear in the Shipping Articles, it was included in the Coasting Manifest signed under oath by the Captain [3]. The Court held that the Captain is the most competent person to know the crew members, and his sworn statement in the manifest constitutes convincing evidence [4]. The Court reiterated the rule that factual findings of the WCC are final and conclusive unless there is a clear showing of failure to consider evidence or abuse of discretion, which was not present in this case [5].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that failure to comply with the time requirements in Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act is non-jurisdictional [6]. Failure or delay in giving notice is not a bar to the claim if the employer had knowledge of the accident or did not suffer by the delay [6]. Here, the petitioner had knowledge of the sinking [7]. Furthermore, under Section 45, the employer's failure to controvert the right to compensation within ten days of knowledge constitutes a statutory renunciation of the right to controvert the claim [7]. The petitioner also failed to file the required report under Section 37, further waiving the defense that the claim was not compensable [8].

Petition denied; Decision affirmed [9].
