I. CAPTION
CHUG SIU and TERESITA B. HADLOC v. THE LOCAL CIVIL REGISTRAR OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-20649, July 31, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On May 29, 1962, petitioners Chug Siu (Chinese) and Teresita B. Hadloc (Filipino), common-law spouses, filed a complaint against the Local Civil Registrar of Manila. They sought to correct the birth certificates of their five children: Guia, Corazon, Matilde, Manuel, and Leticia [1]. The alleged errors included: (1) Guia was registered as "legitimate" while the others were "illegitimate" despite all being born of the same unmarried parents; (2) Corazon and Matilde were recorded as "Chinese" despite their mother being Filipino; (3) the mother's civil status in Guia's record should be "single"; and (4) the surname "Chug" was misspelled in all certificates [1]. Petitioners claimed these errors were inadvertent due to the mother's weak condition during childbirth [2]. The Local Civil Registrar refused to correct the entries without a judicial order [2]. The Solicitor General opposed, arguing the changes were substantial and controversial, affecting citizenship and status, and thus could not be corrected via a summary proceeding under Article 412 of the Civil Code [3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the correction of entries in the civil registry regarding citizenship and filiation can be granted through a summary proceeding under Article 412 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. It is settled law that a summary petition under Article 412 of the Civil Code does not lie where the matter concerns the citizenship and status not only of the petitioners but of their children [4]. Substantial alterations affecting status and citizenship in the Civil Registry cannot be ordered by the court unless threshed out in an "appropriate action wherein *all* parties who may be affected by the entries are notified or represented" (citing *Ty Kong Tin v. Republic* and *Baybayan v. Republic*) [4, 5]. Summary proceedings under Article 412 are limited to innocuous or clerical errors, such as misspellings, that are visible to the eyes or obvious to the understanding [5]. While the misspelling of the name "Chug" might be clerical, the other requested changes involved the civil status of the parents and the citizenship of the children, which are substantial in nature [6]. Furthermore, declaratory relief is not available for the purpose of obtaining a judicial declaration of citizenship [7].

The order of dismissal by the lower court is affirmed [8].
