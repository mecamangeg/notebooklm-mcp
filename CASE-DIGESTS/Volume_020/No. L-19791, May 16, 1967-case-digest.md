I. CAPTION
KAPISANAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA SA MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. RAFAEL HERNANDEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19791, May 16, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On December 12, 1960, Rafael Hernandez and approximately 400 union members (respondents) filed a complaint in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against their Union and its officers (petitioners). They alleged violations of Section 17 of Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act), specifically that the Union levied a monthly assessment of P5.00 without membership authority (as the Constitution limited it to P2.00) and unauthorizedly appropriated funds for attorney's fees and the Union President's trip abroad [1-3]. After the hearing but before the decision, the Union submitted a "certification" claiming that a convention held in March 1961 had ratified the questioned collections and expenses [4, 5]. The CIR *en banc* disregarded this certification because it was submitted late, denying respondents the chance to cross-examine. It ruled in favor of respondents, ordering the Union to stop the collections and reimburse the unauthorized expenses [6, 7]. The Union appealed, questioning the CIR's jurisdiction due to non-exhaustion of intra-union remedies and the disregard of the ratification evidence [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR properly intervened in the Union's internal affairs despite the alleged failure to exhaust intra-union remedies.
2. W/N the CIR erred in totally disregarding the certification of ratification submitted after the hearing.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that while Section 17 of R.A. No. 875 generally requires exhaustion of internal remedies before judicial intervention, this rule is not absolute. The Union's by-laws required filing charges with the Board of Directors, but since the complaint was directed against the incumbent Board members themselves, complying with the procedure would be a "farce" where the Board acts as respondent, investigator, and judge [9]. The Court ruled that where exhaustion of remedies would be illusory, vain, or amount to a denial of justice, it will not be insisted upon as a condition for judicial relief [3, 9].

2. **YES.** The Court acknowledged that under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 875, the CIR is not bound solely by evidence presented during the hearing [7]. However, due process requires that the opposing party be given the right to cross-examine to test the veracity of evidence and prevent self-serving assertions [10]. While the CIR was correct to initially question the late submission, the Court found that the alleged ratification resolutions were material to the issues of the case [10]. To serve the ends of truth and justice, the evidence should be admitted properly with the opportunity for cross-examination.
The decision was **SET ASIDE** and the case **REMANDED** to the lower court for the reception of evidence concerning the resolutions [11].
