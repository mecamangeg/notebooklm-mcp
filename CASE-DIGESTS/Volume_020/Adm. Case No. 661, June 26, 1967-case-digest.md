I. CAPTION
RICAFORT v. BALTAZAR, Adm. Case No. 661, June 26, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
In January 1965, petitioner Fernando Ricafort purchased an Austin car on installment from S.L. Ocampo, Inc. His wife, Lydia, issued a check for the down payment of P3,133.00, which she altered from a postdated check to a current one at the company agent's request. The check was dishonored for being "Not arranged for." Respondent Atty. Jose G. Baltazar, Jr., counsel for the car company, wrote to Ricafort demanding payment within three days under threat of criminal action. Ricafort replied claiming an agreement with the agent to hold the check until March 31. Respondent then obtained an affidavit from the agent denying such agreement. Respondent advised the company that an *estafa* case could be filed but declined to handle it personally because the presiding Municipal Judge was his father. The case was filed by another lawyer, and a writ of attachment was issued leading to the seizure of the car. Consequently, Ricafort filed this disbarment petition alleging malpractice, gross misconduct, and harassment. The Solicitor General investigated and recommended exoneration.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N respondent Atty. Baltazar is guilty of malpractice, gross misconduct, and harassment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court dismissed the complaint and exonerated the respondent. First, the respondent did not immediately file charges but requested the spouses to make good the check, an act which belies harassment or malpractice [1]. Second, upon receiving Ricafort's claim of a special agreement regarding the check date, respondent properly inquired with the agent and secured an affidavit contradicting Ricafort's claim. The allegations in the subsequent complaint were based on this affidavit and were not of respondent's own making [2]. Finally, although the complaint was filed in his father's court, it was filed by another lawyer, and there was no evidence respondent influenced the judge [3].

The complaint for malpractice is dismissed [4].
