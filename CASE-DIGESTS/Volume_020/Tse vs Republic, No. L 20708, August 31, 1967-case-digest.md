**I. CAPTION**
IN RE: PETITION TO CHANGE NAME OF FELIMON TSE AND ALICE TSE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20708, August 31, 1967, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
On May 26, 1962, petitioners Felimon Tse (17 years old) and Alice Tse (16 years old), assisted by their mother and guardian *ad litem* Ismaela Dawat, filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of Leyte to change their names to Florimon Sia and Alice Sia, respectively [1]. They argued that they had used the surname "Sia" since birth in their social relations and school records, and that the Chinese surname "Tse" is equivalent to "Sia" [1]. They claimed that retaining "Tse" would cause difficulties in pursuing higher education due to discrepancies with their school records [1]. The Republic opposed the petition, arguing that the stated reason was insufficient [2]. The trial court granted the petition. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that the petition was defective because it was verified by minors and that the grounds for the change were insufficient [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petition is void because it was verified by minors.
2. W/N the confusion in school records constitutes a valid ground for a change of name.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The petition is valid. Section 2, Rule 103 of the Rules of Court requires a petition to be signed and verified by "the person desiring his name changed" but contains no rule requiring that person to be of legal age [3]. Furthermore, under Article 316 of the New Civil Code, parents have the duty to represent their unemancipated children in actions that redound to their benefit [3]. The mother's appearance as guardian *ad litem* cured any alleged incapacity, as jurisdiction depends on the nature of the proceeding rather than the capacity of the parties to sue [4].

2. **YES.** The Court found reasonable necessity for the change. The evidence established that the petitioners had been using the names Florimon Sia and Alice Sia for school purposes and that their records were under said names [5]. This practical reality constitutes a valid ground to authorize the change to avoid confusion. Additionally, the Court noted that the Chinese surname "Tse" is effectively the same as or equivalent to "Sia" [5].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed.
