I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE and COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS v. BOTELHO SHIPPING CORPORATION and GENERAL SHIPPING CO., INC., G.R. Nos. L-21633-34, June 29, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
In 1960, respondents Botelho Shipping Corporation and General Shipping Co., Inc. entered into conditional purchase and sale contracts with the Reparations Commission (Repacom) for the vessels "M/S Maria Rosello" and "M/S General Lim," respectively [1]. Upon the vessels' arrival in Manila, the Bureau of Customs refused to register them unless the respondents paid compensating tax amounting to approximately P483,433 and P494,824 [2]. At the time of purchase, the original Reparations Law (Republic Act No. 1789) only exempted reparations goods from customs duties, consular fees, and special import tax, but not compensating tax [3].

The respondents filed petitions for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [4]. While the cases were pending, Republic Act No. 3079 was enacted on June 17, 1961, amending R.A. No. 1789 to include an exemption from compensating tax [5]. Section 20 of the amendatory law allowed existing end-users to "renovate" their utilization contracts to avail of provisions more favorable to them [5]. Respondents applied for and were granted renovation of their contracts by Repacom [6]. The CTA ruled in favor of the respondents, declaring them exempt from the tax [6]. The Commissioners of Internal Revenue and Customs appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondents are exempt from compensating tax under R.A. No. 3079 despite purchasing the reparations goods prior to the law's enactment.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals [7]. While R.A. No. 1789 did not originally exempt reparations goods from compensating tax, Section 20 of the amendatory act (R.A. No. 3079) expressly allows end-users who acquired goods prior to its effectivity to apply for the renovation of their utilization contracts [3, 8].

The Court held that by renovating their contracts and voluntarily assuming the new obligations imposed by the amendatory law, the respondents are entitled to be treated "in like manner and to the same extent" as end-users who applied after the law's passage [8]. The legislative intent of Section 20 was to abolish discrimination and place earlier purchasers on the same footing as later ones [8]. Thus, upon the approval of the renovated contracts, the favorable provisions of R.A. No. 3079, including the exemption from compensating tax, applied retroactively to the respondents' vessels [9, 10].

**Decision affirmed.**
