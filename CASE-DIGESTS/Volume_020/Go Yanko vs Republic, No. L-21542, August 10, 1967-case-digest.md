I. CAPTION
JOSEPH C. GO YANKO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21542, August 10, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Joseph C. Go Yanko, a citizen of Nationalist China residing in Cebu, filed a petition for naturalization on May 7, 1956 [1]. He is married to a Filipina and has five children [1]. To prove his financial capacity, he presented evidence that he was a part-owner of Aeroplane Shoe Store, earning an annual income of P4,100.00 (approximately P341.66 monthly) from salary and profits [1, 2].

The Court of First Instance of Cebu denied the petition. While the trial court initially cited non-compliance with posting requirements (which was later clarified), it ultimately denied the petition due to discrepancies between his income tax return and residence certificate, which cast doubt on his moral character [2, 3]. Go Yanko appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing errors by the lower court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner satisfies the requirement of a lucrative trade, profession, or occupation under the Revised Naturalization Law.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the denial of the petition [4]. The Court ruled that the petitioner's annual income of P4,100.00 is insufficient to be considered "lucrative" within the contemplation of the Revised Naturalization Law, given that he has a wife and five children to support [2, 5].

The Court relied on established jurisprudence where naturalization was denied due to insufficient income relative to dependents, specifically citing *Uy Ching Ho v. Republic* (income of P4,000–P7,799 with 5 children), *Tan v. Republic* (income of P6,300 with 1 child), and *Koa Gui v. Republic* (income of P5,980 with 3 children) [5].

Judgment affirmed [4].
