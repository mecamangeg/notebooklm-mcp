**I. CAPTION**
HEIRS OF PELAGIO ZARA: PIO MINDANAO, ET AL. v. DIRECTOR OF LANDS, DIRECTOR OF FORESTRY, VICENTE V. DE VILLA, JR., and VICENTE S. DE VILLA, SR., G.R. No. L-19535, July 10, 1967, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
On August 4, 1960, applicants-appellants (Heirs of Pelagio Zara) filed an application for registration of a 107-hectare parcel of land in Batangas [1]. They claimed inheritance from their grandfather under a Spanish grant or, alternatively, continuous and adverse possession for over 30 years under Chapter VIII, Section 48(b) of Commonwealth Act (C.A.) No. 141 (Public Land Law) [1].

Private oppositors Vicente V. de Villa, Jr. and Sr., along with government directors, opposed the application [2]. The De Villas filed a motion to dismiss, arguing *res judicata* [2, 3]. They cited a 1949 decision (Civil Case No. 26) regarding the same land where Vicente S. de Villa, Sr.'s application was denied, and the court declared the property as public land [2]. The lower court dismissed the Heirs' application, ruling that land already adjudged as public cannot be the subject of another registration proceeding and can only be disposed of by the Director of Lands [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N a previous judgment declaring a tract of land as public land bars a subsequent application for judicial confirmation of title based on continuous possession under Section 48(b) of C.A. 141.
2. W/N the private oppositors have the personality to oppose the registration.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that the previous judgment does not preclude the subsequent application. While a prior proceeding *in rem* might bar a claim of ownership under Act 496 due to constructive notice, it does not foreclose a claim for judicial confirmation of imperfect title under C.A. 141 [4]. The Court explained that a proceeding under Section 48(b) of the Public Land Law precisely "presupposes that the land is public" [4, 5]. The decree of judicial confirmation is not based on the land being privately owned, but on the legal presumption that by reason of the claimant's possession for 30 years or more, they have performed all conditions essential to a government grant [4, 6]. Thus, the declaration of the land's public character in 1949 did not disturb the applicants' possessory rights.

2. **YES.** The private oppositors have the personality to file an opposition because they claim to be in possession of the land and have applied for its purchase from the Bureau of Lands [6, 7].

The order of dismissal was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the court *a quo* for trial and judgment on the merits [7].
