I. CAPTION
GOVERNMENT OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MOISES SONGCUYA and ISIDRO LABRADOR, G.R. No. L-18981, May 16, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On March 24, 1954, the Government filed an action against Songcuya and Labrador (a bonded postmaster and money order clerk) to recover P4,224.30 representing eleven dishonored War Damage checks they endorsed to the Government [1, 2]. The case was called for trial on October 10, 1955, but was postponed "until further assignment" upon the defendants' request [3].

Four years later, on August 20, 1959, the case was called again. The provincial fiscal moved for postponement because a material witness, a postal inspector, failed to appear due to lack of transportation [4, 5]. The Court of First Instance of Cotabato denied the motion and dismissed the case for failure to prosecute [1, 4]. The fiscal filed a motion for reconsideration, attaching the witness's telegram, but the trial court denied it, stating in the order that the checks were guaranteed and paid in the ordinary course of business [5, 6]. The Government appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved a pure question of law [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the complaint for failure to prosecute was proper.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the order of dismissal. The Court found that the fiscal was constrained to ask for postponement due to the witness's lack of transportation, a valid ground excusing the failure to appear [7, 8]. Furthermore, the trial judge's order denying reconsideration improperly prejudged the merits of the case without a trial by commenting on the validity of the check payments [8].

While the Government allowed four years to elapse from the first trial date, the Court noted that court sessions in Cotabato were likely not continuous, contributing to the delay, and the defendants themselves showed a lack of interest in disposing of the case [8, 9]. In equity, a dismissal on the merits would prejudice the Government's claim; thus, the case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [8, 10].
