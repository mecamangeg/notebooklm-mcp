**I. CAPTION**
EDGARDO O. ALZATE v. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20068, June 26, 1967, 20 SCRA 422, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
The land in question was originally owned by Rufino Ellison (TCT No. 21557). On March 17, 1944, Ellison sold the land to Emeterio Ramos [1]. In 1946, Ramos filed for reconstitution of the lost title, resulting in the issuance of TCT No. 78189 in his name on March 12, 1946 [1]. Ramos then sold the land to Pacita T. Javier, cancelling his title and issuing TCT No. 2306 in Javier’s name on August 2, 1946 [1]. Javier eventually sold the land to Ismael Alzate (predecessor of plaintiff-appellee Edgardo Alzate), resulting in TCT No. 38647 [1].

However, on December 18, 1946—months after the title had already been transferred to Javier—Ramos obtained a *second* title (TCT No. 3936) for the same land based on the original 1944 deed of sale [2]. This second title was transferred to Quezon City as TCT No. 28281 [2]. In 1955, defendant-appellant Philippine National Bank (PNB) levied upon this second title pursuant to a judgment against Ramos [3]. PNB acquired the property at the execution sale and was issued TCT No. 44422 [3].

Alzate filed suit to declare his title valid and PNB’s title null and void. The Court of First Instance of Quezon City ruled in favor of Alzate [4]. PNB appealed, arguing its title should retroact to the 1944 entry of the deed of sale in the Day Book, thus antedating Alzate’s title [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Alzate’s certificate of title prevails over PNB’s certificate of title.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that Alzate's title is superior.

The Court applied the doctrine laid down in *Legarda v. Saleeby*, which states that where two certificates of title purport to include the same registered land, the holder of the earlier one continues to hold the title [6]. Alzate’s title is derived from Javier, whose title (August 2, 1946) predates the issuance of the source title of PNB (December 18, 1946) [2, 7].

Although PNB argued that the registration of the 1944 deed of sale should retroact to its entry in the Day Book, the Court noted that this same deed was the source of Javier's (and thus Alzate's) right [7]. Since Ramos had already sold the land to Javier before PNB levied on it, Ramos retained no interest in the property. A judgment creditor (PNB) only acquires at an execution sale the identical interest possessed by the judgment debtor (Ramos) [8]. Since the debtor had no right to the property at the time of the execution sale, the purchaser acquires nothing [8].

The judgment appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
