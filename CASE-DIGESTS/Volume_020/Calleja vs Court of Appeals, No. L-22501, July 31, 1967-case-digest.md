**I. CAPTION**
MARIANO CALLEJA v. COURT OF APPEALS, MUNICIPALITY OF IRIGA, JOSE VlLLANUEVA and MARCIANO TINO, G.R. No. L-22501, July 31, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Mariano Calleja and other employees were separated from service by the Municipality of Iriga due to the abolition of their positions. They filed a petition for mandamus (Civil Case No. 5077) with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Sur against the Municipality and its officials for reinstatement and back salaries. The respondents were represented by the Provincial Fiscal of Camarines Sur, collaborated by Municipal Attorney Silvestre Felix. The CFI rendered a decision ordering reinstatement and payment of back salaries [1, 2].

The Provincial Fiscal received the decision but did not file an appeal. On the last day of the reglementary period, Municipal Attorney Felix filed the notice of appeal and appeal bond on behalf of the respondents. Petitioner objected, arguing that under the Revised Administrative Code, only the Provincial Fiscal could legally represent the municipality in court. The CFI overruled the objection and gave due course to the appeal. Petitioner moved to dismiss the appeal before the Court of Appeals (CA), which denied the motion [2-4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Municipal Attorney has the authority to sign a notice of appeal for the municipality without the signature or conformity of the Provincial Fiscal.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the Municipal Attorney has the authority to represent the municipality in court. While Sections 1681 and 1683 of the Revised Administrative Code designate the Provincial Fiscal as the law officer and legal counsel for the province and its municipalities, these provisions were modified by Section 3, paragraph 3(a) of Republic Act No. 2264 (Local Autonomy Act) [5].

RA 2264 empowers municipal councils to create the office of Municipal Attorney to act as legal counsel. Harmonizing the two laws, the Court held that both the Provincial Fiscal and the Municipal Attorney can act as legal officer or counsel for the municipality. This interpretation aligns with the purpose of the Local Autonomy Act to increase local government powers. To deny the Municipal Attorney the duty to appear in court would render the provision of RA 2264 useless [6, 7]. Thus, the notice of appeal signed by Municipal Attorney Felix was valid and effectively brought the appeal to the CA [8].

Petition dismissed; the order of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [9].
