I. CAPTION
CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES v. THE HONORABLE JUDGE JESUS P. MORFE and FIRST MUTUAL SAVING AND LOAN ORGANIZATION, INC., G.R. No. L-20119, June 30, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent First Mutual Saving and Loan Organization, Inc. (Organization) was a non-stock corporation whose by-laws created "founder members" with exclusive voting rights and "participating members" who contributed savings but had no voting rights [1, 2]. The Central Bank (Petitioner) opined that the Organization was illegally engaged in banking by accepting public deposits without authority under Republic Act No. 337 (General Banking Act) [3]. Following an investigation, a Central Bank intelligence officer applied for and obtained a search warrant from the Municipal Court of Manila on May 18, 1962, to seize the Organization's books and records, alleging they were used in the commission of a felony (violation of RA 337) [4, 5].

The Organization filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition in the Court of First Instance of Manila. Respondent Judge Morfe issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the search and ordering the return of seized documents [6, 7]. Judge Morfe ruled that the search warrant was unreasonable because the deponent failed to specify "illegal banking transactions... with specific persons," characterizing the warrant as a "roving commission" or fishing expedition [8]. The Central Bank filed the instant petition for certiorari to annul Judge Morfe's order [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the search warrant was unreasonable for failing to identify specific illegal transactions with specific persons.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the search warrant was valid and not unreasonable. The constitutional injunction against unreasonable searches and seizures seeks to forestall specific evils, but unreasonableness is a condition dependent upon the circumstances surrounding each case [10]. The failure of the deponent to mention particular individuals did not prove he lacked personal knowledge of specific illegal transactions, as a witness may be acquainted with transactions even if the names of the individuals are unknown [11].

Furthermore, the Court rejected the lower court's assumption that illegal banking must always imply a specific "victim" or actual injury; the law requiring compliance with banking requirements seeks to protect the public against "potential" injury as well [12]. The acts imputed to the Organization were not isolated transactions requiring specific identification of parties, but rather constituted the "general pattern" of its business [13]. The Organization effectively accepted deposits from the "public" (participating members) without complying with RA 337 [14]. Citing *Alvarez v. Court of First Instance*, the Court concluded the Municipal Judge did not commit grave abuse of discretion in finding probable cause [15].

The petition is GRANTED; the order and writ of injunction are set aside [16].
