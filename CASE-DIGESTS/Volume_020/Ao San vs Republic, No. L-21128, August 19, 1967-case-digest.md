I. CAPTION
AO SAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21128, August 19, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ao San filed a petition for naturalization, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Manila on May 12, 1960. Two years later, Ao San filed a petition to take his oath of allegiance, alleging compliance with Republic Act No. 530. The Solicitor General opposed the oath-taking and moved to set aside the 1960 decision, citing defects in the petition: (1) failure to state all former places of residence (specifically addresses at 742 Alvarado and 546 Azcarraga appearing in his alien/immigrant certificates); and (2) discrepancies regarding his children (original petition listed 5, amended listed 8) and a biologically improbable birth interval of only 5 months and 25 days between two alleged children.

On January 11, 1963, the lower court set aside its 1960 decision and dismissed the petition "without prejudice." Ao San appealed, arguing that the 1960 decision had already become final and could not be set aside.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 1960 lower court decision granting naturalization had become final and unappealable.
2. W/N the failure to state all former places of residence in the petition is a fatal defect.
3. W/N the petitioner possesses the requisite good moral character for naturalization.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A decision in naturalization proceedings does not become final until after the issuance of the naturalization certificate and compliance with Republic Act No. 530. Until the oath-taking, the only vested right is that of the Republic to ensure only qualified applicants are admitted. The trial court retains jurisdiction to set aside its decision prior to the oath-taking.

2. **YES.** The failure of the applicant to state all former places of residence in the petition is fatal and affects the jurisdiction of the court. The petitioner failed to mention his residences at Alvarado and Azcarraga, Manila, which were listed in his alien and immigrant certificates.

3. **NO.** The petitioner failed to prove good moral character. The unexplained increase in the number of children from five in the original petition to eight in the amended petition, combined with the "rare and oddity" of a 5-month-and-25-day birth interval between two children, suggested an attempt to falsely claim children to secure their citizenship. Such conduct reflects a lack of good moral character.

The appealed order is **AFFIRMED**, with the **MODIFICATION** that the dismissal is **WITH PREJUDICE**.
