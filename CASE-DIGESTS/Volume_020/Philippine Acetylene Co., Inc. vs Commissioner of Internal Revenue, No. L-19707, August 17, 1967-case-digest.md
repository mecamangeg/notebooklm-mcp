I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE ACETYLENE CO., INC. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE and COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-19707, August 17, 1967, 20 SCRA 1056, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Philippine Acetylene Co., Inc., a manufacturer of oxygen and acetylene gases, sold its products to the National Power Corporation (NPC) and the Voice of America (VOA) between 1953 and 1958. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed deficiency sales taxes and surcharges amounting to P12,910.60 on these transactions. The petitioner protested, arguing that sales to the NPC were exempt because the NPC enjoys exemption from "all taxes" under its charter, and sales to the VOA were exempt as sales to an agency of the United States Government.

The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled that the sales to the NPC were taxable because the percentage tax under Section 186 of the Tax Code is a tax on the manufacturer, not the buyer. regarding the VOA, the CTA held that sales supported by exemption certificates were exempt, reducing the liability to P12,812.16. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, insisting on full exemption.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N sales to the National Power Corporation are exempt from the percentage (sales) tax given its tax-exempt status.
2. W/N sales to the Voice of America are exempt from sales tax under the Military Bases Agreement.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The tax imposed by Section 186 of the National Internal Revenue Code is a tax on the manufacturer or producer, not on the purchaser [1, 2]. While the economic burden of the tax may ultimately be shifted to the purchaser, the legal incidence of the tax falls on the seller. The Court rejected the "pass on" theory as a basis for exemption, citing American jurisprudence (*Alabama v. King & Boozer*) which established that the immunity of a government agency from taxation does not extend to the taxes imposed on those who furnish supplies to it [2, 3]. Therefore, the NPC's exemption from "all taxes" does not relieve the petitioner from paying sales tax on goods sold to the NPC.

2. **NO.** Under Article V of the Bases Agreement, only sales made for "exclusive use in the construction, maintenance, operation or defense of the bases" (i.e., sales to the quartermaster) are exempt [4, 5]. Sales to other US agencies like the VOA are not exempt. Furthermore, Article XVIII only exempts sales made *within* the bases *by* commissaries, not sales made *to* them [5]. The Court ruled that tax exemptions must be strictly construed [6]. Consequently, BIR Circular No. V-41, which purported to grant a broader exemption for goods purchased by US civilian agencies, is void for expanding the terms of the treaty [6, 7].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **MODIFIED**. The petitioner is ordered to pay the full amount of P12,910.60.
