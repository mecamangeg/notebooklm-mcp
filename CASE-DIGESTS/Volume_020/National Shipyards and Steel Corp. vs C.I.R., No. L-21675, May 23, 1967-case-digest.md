I. CAPTION
NATIONAL SHIPYARDS AND STEEL CORPORATION v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and DOMINGO DE JESUS, G.R. No. L-21675, May 23, 1967, 20 SCRA 41, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Domingo de Jesus, a welder employed by petitioner NASSCO (a government-owned corporation) since 1937, was suspended on October 14, 1960, for an alleged infraction regarding welding rods. Although initially suspended for 90 days, NASSCO refused to readmit him and eventually dismissed him. On March 21, 1962—approximately 17 months after his separation—De Jesus filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) praying for reinstatement with back wages and payment of overtime compensation for unpaid work rendered from June to September 1960 [1, 2]. NASSCO moved to dismiss, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction and that the action was barred by laches [3]. The CIR denied the motion and rendered a decision declaring the dismissal illegal, ordering reinstatement with back wages, and awarding overtime pay [4]. NASSCO appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR has jurisdiction over a case involving a claim for reinstatement coupled with a claim for overtime pay.
2. W/N the respondent’s cause of action for reinstatement is barred by laches.
3. W/N the respondent is entitled to overtime compensation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The CIR has jurisdiction. The Supreme Court held that while a mere action for reinstatement or one coupled with a claim for back wages or damages is insufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the CIR, the court acquires jurisdiction if the action for reinstatement is accompanied by another claim arising out of the Minimum Wage Law or the Eight-Hour Labor Law [5, 6]. Since the complaint prayed for reinstatement *and* payment of overtime compensation (which involves the Eight-Hour Labor Law), the CIR properly assumed jurisdiction [6].

2. **YES.** The action for reinstatement is barred by laches. De Jesus, as an employee of a government-owned corporation, belongs to the unclassified civil service [7]. Public officials must file actions for reinstatement (via *quo warranto* or mandamus) within one year from removal; otherwise, they are considered to have abandoned their office [8]. Since De Jesus filed his complaint 17 months after his removal, his claim for reinstatement is barred [7].

3. **YES.** The award for overtime pay is proper. The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's factual finding that De Jesus rendered unpaid overtime services, noting that such findings are conclusive upon the Court [9]. Furthermore, unlike the reinstatement claim, the claim for overtime pay was not barred because an action to enforce a right under the Eight-Hour Labor Law may be brought within three years after the cause of action accrued [10]. De Jesus filed well within this period.

**Disposition:** The decision and orders appealed from are AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that respondent De Jesus shall not be reinstated nor paid back wages, but the award for overtime compensation is sustained [10].
