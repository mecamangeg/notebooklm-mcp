I. CAPTION
THE SHELL REFINING COMPANY (PHILIPPINES) INC. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE, NATIONAL RAILWAYS COMPANY and/or BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-24930, July 31, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On November 19, 1963, petitioner Shell Refining Company filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against respondents Manila Port Service (MPS), National Railways Company, and the Bureau of Customs (BOC) to recover P16,210.11 for merchandise lost or damaged while in the custody of the arrastre service [1].

MPS operated the arrastre service at the Port of Manila until November 21, 1962, when its management contract was terminated. Thereafter, the BOC, through its Customs Arrastre Service (CAS), assumed the operation and management of the arrastre service [2, 3]. Shell's claims involved shipments that arrived and were allegedly lost or damaged during the period when the BOC was already operating the service [4-17].

The CFI rendered judgment ordering MPS to pay for a specific claim under its tenure but dismissed the causes of action against the BOC [18]. Shell appealed solely on the dismissal of the claims against the BOC, arguing that the Bureau should be liable for losses incurred while operating the arrastre service [19].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Bureau of Customs can be sued for its operation of the arrastre service.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the complaint against the Bureau of Customs. The Court reiterated the doctrine laid down in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service and Bureau of Customs* (G.R. No. L-23139, December 17, 1966), holding that the Bureau of Customs is an agency of the government rendering governmental functions and is, therefore, immune from suit [19]. As the State had not given its consent to be sued, the Bureau cannot be held liable. The decision appealed from was affirmed [20].
