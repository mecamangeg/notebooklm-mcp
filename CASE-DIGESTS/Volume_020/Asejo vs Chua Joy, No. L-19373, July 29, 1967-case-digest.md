I. CAPTION
FELIX ASEJO, ET AL. v. ADRIANO CHUA JOY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19373, July 29, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were crew members of vessels owned by respondent Adriano Chua Joy (South Sea Shipping Lines). Respondent South Sea Seamen's Union had a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the employer containing a closed shop clause. When petitioners affiliated with a rival union and filed for a certification election in 1958, the respondent Union demanded their termination pursuant to the closed shop clause. Petitioners filed a petition for declaratory relief with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance of Manila to declare the clause void. The trial court granted the injunction and later made it permanent, preventing the petitioners' dismissal. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, in a related case (G.R. No. L-14689, decided July 26, 1960), the Supreme Court ordered a certification election to determine the proper bargaining representative. On April 25, 1967, the Court issued a resolution requiring the parties to show cause why the instant appeal should not be dismissed as moot given the 1960 decision [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed for the parties' failure to show cause regarding the mootness of the case.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court dismissed the petition. The Court noted that the certification election ordered in the related case (G.R. No. L-14689) may have rendered the issues in the present case moot. Despite receiving notice of the Court's resolution dated April 25, 1967, which directed the parties to show cause within fifteen (15) days why the petition should not be dismissed, neither party complied. Due to this failure to show cause, the Court resolved to dismiss the petition without pronouncement as to costs [4, 5].
