I. CAPTION
**THE BOARD OF LIQUIDATORS representing THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HEIRS OF MAXIMO M. KALAW, JUAN BOCAR, ESTATE OF THE DECEASED CASIMIRO GARCIA, and LEONOR MOLL**, G.R. No. L-18805, August 14, 1967, 20 SCRA 987, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
The National Coconut Corporation (NACOCO) was a government-chartered corporation with Maximo Kalaw as its General Manager and Board Chairman. Between July and October 1947, Kalaw executed several contracts for the forward sale of copra without the prior approval of the Board of Directors, contrary to the corporate by-laws. Four typhoons subsequently devastated the Philippines, causing massive damage to coconut trees and a spike in copra prices. NACOCO failed to fulfill the contracts, leading to lawsuits from buyers which were settled for over P1.3 million.

NACOCO was later abolished by Executive Order No. 372, and the Board of Liquidators was created to settle its affairs. The Board of Liquidators sued Kalaw and the directors for negligence and bad faith for having approved/ratified the contracts despite the known losses. Kalaw died before trial. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, ruling the contracts valid and the losses due to force majeure.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Board of Liquidators has the legal personality to prosecute the case after the expiration of the three-year statutory liquidation period.
2. W/N the action for damages survives the death of Maximo Kalaw.
3. W/N Kalaw had implied authority to execute contracts without prior Board approval.
4. W/N the directors are liable for damages for ratifying the contracts.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Board of Liquidators has the personality to proceed as a party-plaintiff. While Section 77 of the Corporation Law limits the continuance of a dissolved corporation to three years, Section 78 allows the conveyance of property to trustees for the benefit of interested parties. By Executive Order No. 372, the government abolished NACOCO and placed its assets in the hands of the Board of Liquidators, creating an express trust. The Board became the trustee with legal interest, while the government retained beneficial interest. No time limit was attached to the Board's existence under the Executive Order [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The action survives. Under the Rules of Court (Rule 88, Sec. 1, now Rule 87), actions to recover damages for an injury to person or property survive the decedent. This suit is not a mere money claim arising from contract (which would be barred if not filed in estate proceedings) but a suit for damages based on the alleged tortious acts (negligence) of the manager [3, 4].

3. **YES.** Kalaw had implied authority to bind the corporation. A corporate officer entrusted with the general management of business has implied authority to enter into contracts necessary for the ordinary course of business [5]. The Board's history of acquiescing to Kalaw's practice of signing contracts without prior approval established a "course of business" that estopped the corporation from denying his authority [6, 7]. Furthermore, the subsequent ratification by the Board cleansed the contracts of defects, relating back to the time of execution [8, 9].

4. **NO.** The directors are not liable. Bad faith requires a dishonest purpose or moral obliquity, which was absent here [10]. The directors ratified the contracts out of a sense of justice and fairness to Kalaw, who had previously generated significant profits for NACOCO using the same methods [11]. The losses were caused by *force majeure* (typhoons), not by the contracts themselves. This is a case of *damnum absque injuria*—damage without actionable wrong [10, 12].

**Judgment affirmed.**
