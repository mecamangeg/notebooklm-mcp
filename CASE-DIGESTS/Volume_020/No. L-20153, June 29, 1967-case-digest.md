I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FULGENCIO BAQUIRAN, G.R. No. L-20153, June 29, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On April 29, 1959, Alberto Castillo was shot dead with a carbine while eating supper with his family in Tumauini, Isabela [1, 2]. His widow, Juanita Marilao, and daughter, Celedonia, pointed to Fulgencio Baquiran as the assailant, claiming they recognized him by the light of kerosene lamps [2, 3]. However, in her initial affidavit, Juanita stated they used candles, and disinterested police officers testified that immediately after the crime, Juanita reported she could not identify the killers because it was dark and their caps were tilted down [4, 5]. Baquiran, a barrio lieutenant, presented an alibi corroborated by independent witnesses, stating he was investigating a theft in another barrio six kilometers away at the time of the shooting [6, 7]. The Court of First Instance of Isabela disregarded the alibi, convicted Baquiran of murder, and sentenced him to life imprisonment [2, 8, 9]. Baquiran appealed, challenging the credibility of the identification [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the identification of the accused was sufficient to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court acquitted the accused, ruling that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The Court applied the principle that "evidence, to be believed, must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness, but it must be credible in itself" [9]. The Court found the widow's identification incredible because: (1) it contradicted her initial statement to police that she did not recognize the killer; (2) the change in testimony regarding the lighting (candles vs. lamps) cast doubt on visibility; and (3) the natural reaction of a witness is to reveal the identity of the offender immediately, yet she delayed for over 24 hours [4, 5, 10].

Furthermore, while alibi is generally a weak defense, it acquires commensurate strength where no positive identification has been satisfactorily made. The Court held that the rule requiring alibi to be satisfactorily proven does not change the burden of proof; the prosecution has the *onus probandi* to establish guilt, and the weakness of the defense does not relieve it of this responsibility [11, 12]. Since the alibi was corroborated by disinterested witnesses and uncontradicted by the prosecution, and the identification was flawed, the judgment was reversed and the appellant was acquitted [13, 14].
