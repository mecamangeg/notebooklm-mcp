I. CAPTION
ELPIDIO JAVELLANA v. NICOLAS LUTERO and THE ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP OF JARO, G.R. No. L-23956, July 21, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On March 29, 1963, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Jaro filed a detainer complaint against Javellana in the Municipal Court of Iloilo City. The trial was postponed six times, largely at the request of Javellana's counsel, Atty. Hautea. The last postponement was granted with an express warning that no further postponements would be entertained. On the scheduled trial date of August 27, 1963, neither Javellana nor his counsel appeared. Another lawyer verbally moved for postponement on Atty. Hautea's behalf, citing business in Manila, but the motion was denied. The court allowed the plaintiff to present evidence *ex parte* and rendered judgment against Javellana. Instead of appealing the decision to the Court of First Instance (CFI) within the reglementary period, Javellana filed a petition for relief from judgment with the CFI approximately 50 days later, claiming excusable negligence and denial of his day in court. The CFI dismissed the petition.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for relief from the judgment of the Municipal Court was proper.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner was not entitled to relief. First, the failure to appear did not constitute excusable negligence nor deprive the petitioner of his day in court. Counsel is duty-bound to prepare for trial with diligence, and his absence after multiple postponements and a specific warning constituted "censurable conduct" and "gross inaction" [1-3].

Second, the proper remedy was an appeal, not a petition for relief. An appeal from a municipal court to the CFI has the effect of vacating the lower court's decision, and the action stands for trial *de novo* regardless of the proof presented below (Sec. 9, Rule 40, Rules of Court) [3, 4]. Since the petitioner could have appealed but failed to do so, granting the petition for relief would impermissibly revive a right to appeal that was irretrievably lost [3].

The decision of the CFI is affirmed. Treble costs were assessed against the petitioner, to be paid by his counsel, for filing a frivolous and dilatory appeal [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Angeles, and Fernando concurred. Chief Justice Concepcion and Justice Dizon did not take part.
