I. CAPTION
JOSE C. ZULUETA v. HON. ANDRES REYES, Judge, Court of First Instance of Rizal, GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM (GSIS) and PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF RIZAL, G.R. No. L-21807, May 29, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jose C. Zulueta obtained five real estate loans totaling P3,117,000 from respondent GSIS, secured by mortgages on his "Antonio Subdivision" in Pasig and "Antonio Apartments" in Manila. The mortgage contracts stipulated that failure to pay amortizations or remit sales proceeds from the subdivision would accelerate the entire obligation.

Starting October 1958, GSIS demanded payment for arrearages, but Zulueta failed to pay. On March 19, 1962, GSIS filed a petition for extra-judicial foreclosure. Zulueta filed a complaint for Damages with Preliminary Injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, claiming that: (1) P437,000 of the loan was improperly released to his contractor, Llorente O. Yarisantos, without his authority; (2) GSIS wrongfully charged interest on partial releases and insurance premiums; and (3) an accounting was necessary before foreclosure.

The CFI initially issued a restraining order but later denied the preliminary injunction and directed the sheriff to proceed with the foreclosure upon GSIS posting a bond, ruling that the only pending issue was accounting and Zulueta’s default was uncontested. Zulueta filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition to nullify the CFI orders.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the loan releases made to the contractor were valid and chargeable to the petitioner.
2. W/N the petitioner is liable for interest on partial releases and for insurance premiums.
3. W/N the extra-judicial foreclosure was premature and should be enjoined pending accounting.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the releases were valid. The funds were paid to suppliers for materials used in the construction of petitioner’s houses. Furthermore, petitioner ratified these releases by crediting them to the contractor (Yarisantos) in a separate civil suit (counterclaim) regarding the construction. Having charged these amounts to the credit of his contractor, petitioner is estopped from questioning their validity and regularity [1], [2].

2. **YES.** On the issue of interest, the mortgage contracts and promissory notes expressly provided for interest on the amounts released. It is untenable to argue that interest should only accrue after the *final* release of the entire loan; a release evidenced by a promissory note immediately earns interest [3]. Regarding insurance premiums, the Court ruled they are part of the mortgage obligation. C.A. 186, Section 23 requires GSIS to insure property held as security, and the mortgage contracts stipulated that premiums were based on agreed policy rates and face values [4].

3. **NO.** The Court ruled that the foreclosure was proper and the injunction was correctly denied. There was no "real, genuine and substantial controversy" regarding the amounts due, as the arrearages were established. A restraining order to resolve "unnecessary question[s] of accounting" would only delay the statutory remedy of extra-judicial foreclosure under Act No. 3135. Petitioner's failure to comply with the mortgage conditions accelerated the entire debt, rendering the foreclosure unassailable [5]-[6].

Petition dismissed.
