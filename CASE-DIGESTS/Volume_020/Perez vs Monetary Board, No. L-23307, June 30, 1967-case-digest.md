I. CAPTION
DAMASO P. PEREZ and REPUBLIC BANK v. MONETARY BOARD, THE SUPERINTENDENT OF BANKS, CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES and SECRETARY OF JUSTICE, G.R. No. L-23307, June 30, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Damaso P. Perez, individually and on behalf of Republic Bank, filed a petition for mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against the Monetary Board, Central Bank (CB), and the Secretary of Justice. Perez sought to compel the respondents to criminally prosecute Pablo Roman and other bank officials for alleged violations of the General Banking Act and the Central Bank Act, and for falsification involving anomalous loans amounting to P1,303,400.00. The respondents moved to dismiss, arguing that the Secretary of Justice had no specific duty to prosecute specific individuals and that the CB had already referred the cases to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for investigation. Although the CFI initially denied the motion to dismiss, it later granted a subsequent motion to dismiss filed by respondents and intervenors, ruling that mandamus was improper. Perez appealed the order of dismissal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N mandamus lies to compel the respondents to criminally prosecute alleged violators of banking laws.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal.

The Court ruled that while the Central Bank and its officials may have the duty under the Central Bank Act and the General Banking Act to *cause* the prosecution of violators, they do not have the specific duty to undertake the *actual* prosecution [1]. The Central Bank is a government corporation, not a prosecution agency, and for it to prosecute would be an *ultra vires* act [1]. The records showed the CB had already referred the matter to DOJ special prosecutors, complying with its duty [2].

Regarding the Secretary of Justice, the Court reiterated the settled rule that mandamus does not lie to compel a prosecuting officer to prosecute a criminal case in court [3, 4]. Furthermore, violations of banking laws are public offenses which any private individual can denounce [3, 4]. Since Perez himself could file the criminal complaints with the fiscal's office, he had a "plain, adequate and speedy remedy in the ordinary course of law," making mandamus improper [5].

**Disposition:** Order of dismissal affirmed.
