I. CAPTION
KABANKALAN SUGAR COMPANY, INC. and AVELINO NARCUE v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and VISAYAS WORKERS AND FARMERS ASSOCIATION-PLUM, G.R. No. L-18901, June 30, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Kabankalan Sugar Company operates *Hacienda* Kalasa, which is devoted exclusively to planting and cultivating sugar cane [1]. In December 1958, respondent union (PLUM) sent collective bargaining proposals to the petitioner. When the petitioner refused to negotiate, PLUM filed a complaint for unfair labor practice with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [2, 3]. The petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction because the laborers were agricultural workers [3].

The CIR assumed jurisdiction, ruling that the workers were industrial employees because they were paid wages (not tenants) and their work—planting, cutting, and loading cane for milling—was integrated with the sugar mill's production under Republic Act No. 809 [4]. The CIR found the petitioner guilty and ordered it to bargain collectively. The petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has jurisdiction over an unfair labor practice case involving workers in a sugar cane hacienda.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CIR resolution. The Court held that the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) was created to enforce all laws and regulations governing the relations of capital and labor on all agricultural lands [5]. It is undisputed that *Hacienda* Kalasa is agricultural land and the dispute arises from labor relations connected to it [5].

Citing *Victorias Milling Co., Inc. v. CIR*, the Court reiterated that the nature of the work classifies a worker. Laborers principally engaged in planting and harvesting sugar cane are agricultural laborers, not industrial employees [6]. Furthermore, Republic Act No. 809 (Philippine Sugar Act of 1952) did not evince legislative intent to convert agricultural laborers into industrial employees [7]. The lack of specific machinery in the CAR to deal with union representation does not confer jurisdiction upon the CIR; the CAR is empowered to set up the necessary organization to deal with such disputes [8].

The Resolution appealed from is reversed [9].
