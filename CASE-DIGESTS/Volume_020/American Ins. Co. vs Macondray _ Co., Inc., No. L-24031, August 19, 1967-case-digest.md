I. CAPTION
THE AMERICAN INSURANCE COMPANY v. MACONDRAY & CO., INC., REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-24031, August 19, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff American Insurance Company, as subrogee, filed a complaint for the recovery of a sum of money against alternative defendants Macondray & Co., Inc. (agent of the carrying vessels) and the Bureau of Customs (arrastre operator) for the loss and non-delivery of imported goods [1]. The complaint was later amended to include the Republic of the Philippines as a defendant [1]. The Republic and the Bureau of Customs filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the Court of First Instance (CFI) lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter because the amount involved was less than P10,000.00, falling within the City Court's jurisdiction [2]. The CFI dismissed the case against the government defendants based on this ground [2]. Plaintiff appealed, arguing that the money claim could be joined with the admiralty action against Macondray, which falls under CFI jurisdiction [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over a money claim of less than P10,000.00 against an arrastre operator when joined with an admiralty action.
2. W/N the complaint against the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs can prosper without an allegation of the State's consent to be sued.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that a money claim of less than P10,000.00 against an arrastre operator may be joined with an action involving admiralty in the Court of First Instance if they arise out of the same transaction [5, 6]. Since the plaintiff was uncertain where the loss occurred—whether in transit (admiralty) or in the custody of the arrastre operator—the alternative causes of action were properly joined, and the CFI had jurisdiction to try the case in its entirety [4].

2. **NO.** Despite the CFI having jurisdiction, the dismissal was affirmed because the State is immune from suit. Non-suability of the State without its consent is a basic principle of the republican form of government [7, 8]. It is the duty of the party suing the government to allege in the complaint that the Republic has consented to be sued, either by special or general law [9, 10]. This allegation is essential to create a justiciable cause of action, and its absence is a fatal defect [10, 11]. Furthermore, the Bureau of Customs is merely a part of the Department of Finance and has no personality of its own apart from the National Government [7, 10].

The order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED**.
