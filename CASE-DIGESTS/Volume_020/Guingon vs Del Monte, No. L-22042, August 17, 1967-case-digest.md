**I. CAPTION**
**DIONISIA GUINGON, ET AL. v. ILUMINADO DEL MONTE, JULIO AGUILAR, and CAPITAL INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC.**, G.R. No. L-22042, August 17, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Julio Aguilar owned jeepneys insured by Capital Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. The policy provided that the insurer would indemnify the insured against all sums which the insured "shall become legally liable to pay" in respect of death or bodily injury to any person. It also contained a "no action" clause, stating that no action shall lie against the company until the insured's obligation is finally determined by judgment or agreement, and prohibiting the joinder of the company as a co-defendant in actions against the insured [1-3].

On February 20, 1961, Aguilar's driver, Iluminado Del Monte, negligently bumped and killed Gervacio Guingon. Del Monte pleaded guilty to homicide thru reckless imprudence [2, 4]. The heirs of Guingon subsequently filed an action for damages against the driver, the owner Aguilar, and the insurer. The insurer moved to dismiss, arguing that under the "no action" clause, the plaintiffs had no cause of action against it and could not join it as a co-defendant [4, 5]. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, holding the insurer liable for P5,000.00. The insurer appealed [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the plaintiffs (third-party victims) can sue the insurer directly.
2. W/N the insurer can be sued jointly with the insured despite the "no action" clause in the insurance policy.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the policy in question is one for indemnity against *liability*, not merely for reimbursement of actual loss. The specific stipulation indemnifying the insured "against all sums... which the Insured shall become legally liable to pay" clearly establishes this nature [7]. The test is: where the contract provides for indemnity against liability to third persons, then third persons to whom the insured is liable can sue the insurer directly [8].

2. **YES.** The "no action" clause in the policy cannot prevail over the Rules of Court provisions on "Joinder of causes of action" (Sec. 5, Rule 2) and "Permissive joinder of parties" (Sec. 6, Rule 3) [9]. These procedural rules aim to avoid a multiplicity of suits. Consequently, the plaintiffs were entitled to join the insurer as a defendant in the same suit against the driver and owner, notwithstanding the contractual prohibition [9, 10].

**Judgment affirmed.**

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles and Fernando concurred. Chief Justice Concepcion and Justice Dizon were on official leave) [9, 11].
