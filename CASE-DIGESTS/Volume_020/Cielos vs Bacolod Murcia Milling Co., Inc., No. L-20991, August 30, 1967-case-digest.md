I. CAPTION
RUFINO CIELOS, ET AL. v. BACOLOD MURCIA MILLING CO., INC., G.R. No. L-20991, August 30, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants were employees of Bacolod Murcia Milling Co., Inc. (defendant) without a definite period. They were members of the Allied Workers Association (AWA), which had a closed-shop agreement with the defendant. In 1953, plaintiffs affiliated with a rival union, NEWSUN. Consequently, they were expelled from AWA and, upon AWA's demand, were dismissed by the defendant on June 16, 1954. Unlike other dismissed employees, plaintiffs did not join the unfair labor practice case against the defendant (which the workers eventually lost) nor did they accept the separation pay offered at the time.

On January 25, 1961, plaintiffs filed a complaint with the City Court of Bacolod to recover termination pay under Republic Act No. 1052 (The Termination Pay Law), which grants one month’s compensation to employees dismissed without notice. The City Court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental also dismissed the case, ruling that the action was barred by the statute of limitations. The lower court applied Article 1146(1) of the Civil Code, holding that the claim was for an "injury to the rights of the plaintiff" and thus prescribed after four years. Plaintiffs appealed directly to the Supreme Court on a question of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs' action for termination pay under Republic Act No. 1052 has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that the obligation of an employer to pay one month's compensation under Republic Act No. 1052 is an **obligation created by law**. RA 1052 mandates that if an employer fails to serve notice one month in advance, they must pay the employee one month's compensation from the date of termination [1]. This obligation is imposed by law regardless of the employment contract [1].

Consequently, the applicable prescriptive period is **ten (10) years** under **Article 1144(2)** of the Civil Code, which governs actions "upon an obligation created by law," and not the four-year period for "injury to the rights of the plaintiff" under Article 1146(1) [2]. Since the plaintiffs were dismissed on June 16, 1954, and filed their complaint on January 25, 1961 (approximately six years and seven months later), the action was instituted well within the ten-year prescriptive period [3], [2].

**Decision reversed.** Defendant-appellee is ordered to pay plaintiffs-appellants their separation pay, with interest and attorney's fees.
