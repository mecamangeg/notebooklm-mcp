I. CAPTION
MANILA CLUB EMPLOYEES UNION v. MANILA CLUB, INC., ROSS, SELPH & CARRASCOSO, SYCIP, GORRES, VELAYO & CO., NOEL R. E. HAWKINS and TANG KOO, G.R. No. L-21501, August 30, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Manila Club, Inc. is a non-stock, non-profit corporation organized to promote social relations among its members. It derives income from monthly dues and the operation of a bar and restaurant which caters exclusively to its members [1, 2]. The Manila Club Employees Union filed a complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP) under Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act) against the club, its trustees, and managers for refusal to bargain collectively and for the dismissal of five employees [3]. The trial judge of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled in favor of the Union, finding the respondents guilty of ULP [4]. However, upon a motion for reconsideration, the CIR *en banc* reversed the decision and dismissed the case, ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter because the club was not organized for profit [5]. The Union appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over Manila Club, Inc.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR *en banc* resolution, holding that the Industrial Court has no jurisdiction over entities not organized for profit [7, 8]. The Court found that Manila Club, Inc. is a non-stock corporation whose Articles of Incorporation expressly provide that no dividends or profits shall inure to its members [2]. The fact that the club operates a bar and restaurant and makes some profit does not render it amenable to the Industrial Peace Act, as these activities are merely incidental to the club's main purpose of promoting social relations [9]. Citing *The Elks Club v. The United Laborers*, the Court reiterated that non-profit social clubs are not industrial entities subject to the jurisdiction of the CIR regarding labor disputes and unfair labor practices [10].

**Resolution affirmed.**
