I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PEDRO B. PATANAO, G.R. No. L-22356, July 21, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant Pedro B. Patanao, a holder of an ordinary timber license in Agusan, was engaged in the business of producing logs and lumber. He failed to file income tax returns for 1953 and 1954, and filed false and fraudulent returns for 1951, 1952, and 1955. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) assessed him P79,892.75 in deficiency income and residence taxes. Despite a demand letter sent on February 14, 1958, Patanao refused to pay, and the assessment became final.

The Republic filed a complaint for collection in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan. Patanao moved to dismiss on two grounds: (1) the action was barred by prior judgment, as he had been acquitted in Criminal Cases Nos. 2089 and 2090 for failure to file returns and non-payment of taxes; and (2) the action had prescribed. The CFI dismissed the complaint regarding the 1951, 1953, and 1954 taxes, ruling that the acquittal in the criminal cases, without a reservation to file a separate civil action, barred the civil liability. The Republic appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the acquittal of the taxpayer in a criminal case for non-payment of income taxes bars the civil action for the collection of said taxes.
2. W/N the action for the collection of the 1951 deficiency tax has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the acquittal in the criminal cases does not exonerate the defendant from his civil liability to pay taxes. Under the Penal Code, civil liability is incurred by reason of the offender's criminal act; however, under the income tax law, civil liability arises from the fact that one has engaged in business, not because of a criminal act. The Court explained that the two cases are founded on different philosophies and factual premises [1]. The National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) provides for criminal penalties (imprisonment/fine) under Section 73, but the civil remedies for collection (distraint, levy, judicial action) are distinct and generally exclusive [2, 3]. Since the government cannot seek satisfaction of the taxpayer's civil liability in the criminal proceeding, the civil liability is not deemed included in the criminal action. Therefore, the obligation to pay taxes is not wiped out by a judicial declaration of the non-existence of the criminal acts charged [3].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the action has not prescribed. The complaint alleged that the fraud in the defendant's 1951 income tax return was discovered on February 14, 1958 [4, 5]. By filing a motion to dismiss based on prescription, the defendant hypothetically admitted the allegations of fraud in the complaint [5, 6]. Consequently, the applicable prescriptive period is ten (10) years from the discovery of the fraud under Section 332(a) of the NIRC, not the five-year period under Section 331. Since the action was instituted on December 7, 1962, it was well within the ten-year period from the discovery of fraud in 1958 [5, 7].

The order appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [8].
