I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MELCHOR TIVIDAD, DELFIN TIVIDAD, FULGENCIO TIVIDAD and FRUCTUOSO TIVIDAD, G.R. No. L-21469, June 30, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On February 14, 1961, in a cockpit in Batangas, a fight ensued between the accused Melchor Tividad and the deceased Regino Murillo. The prosecution established that while Melchor and Regino were grappling, Melchor's brothers—Delfin, Fulgencio, and Fructuoso—intervened. Delfin stabbed Regino in the back, while Fulgencio and Fructuoso struck him with pieces of bamboo picked up from the ground. The autopsy revealed eleven wounds, three of which were fatal.

The Court of First Instance of Batangas convicted all four brothers of murder qualified by treachery, sentencing them to life imprisonment and joint indemnification because it found a conspiracy. All accused appealed, but Melchor withdrew his appeal, making his conviction final. The remaining appellants (Delfin, Fulgencio, and Fructuoso) denied complicity, claiming Melchor fought alone in self-defense or that they did not participate.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N there was a conspiracy among the Tividad brothers to kill the deceased.
2. W/N the appellants are criminally liable for murder.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that conspiracy was not proven. Conspiracy requires positive and convincing evidence of a common design, which was absent here. The Court noted that: (a) the brothers' presence at the cockpit and departure together were due to the communal nature of the activity and their being neighbors; (b) there was no evidence of a prior grudge; (c) the attacks were not simultaneous but successive; and (d) Melchor, who started the fight, was unarmed and smaller than the deceased. The intervention of the brothers appeared to be born of "fraternal instincts" rather than a pre-conceived criminal plan. The Court reiterated that simultaneity of attack alone does not prove conspiracy; there must be a concurrence of wills ( *U.S. vs. Magcomot* ).

2. **PARTIALLY NO.** In the absence of conspiracy, each accused is responsible only for the consequences of his own acts ( *U.S. vs. Abiog* ).
*   **Delfin Tividad:** Guilty of **MURDER**. He was positively identified as the one who treacherously stabbed the deceased in the back while the latter was pinning down Melchor. Treachery is appreciated against the assailant who resorted to that mode of attack.
*   **Fulgencio and Fructuoso Tividad:** Guilty of **SLIGHT PHYSICAL INJURIES**. They had no intent to kill, evidenced by their use of bamboo poles found on the ground rather than lethal weapons. Since the prosecution failed to prove the extent of injuries they specifically caused, they are liable only for slight physical injuries.

**Disposition:** Judgment is **AFFIRMED** regarding Delfin Tividad (Murder). Judgment is **MODIFIED** for Fulgencio and Fructuoso Tividad, who are sentenced to ten days of *arresto menor* and ordered released having served preventive imprisonment. Melchor and Delfin are jointly and severally liable for the indemnity.
