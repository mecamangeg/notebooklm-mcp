**I. CAPTION**
JOSE G. SYSON v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21199, May 29, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

**II. FACTS**
Jose G. Syson filed a petition for naturalization in 1959, alleging he had three children, resided at 1563 Dart, Paco, Manila (with one former residence), and possessed a lucrative income. The Solicitor General opposed the petition, presenting evidence that Syson actually had five children, failed to disclose all former residences, and lacked proficiency in Spanish. The trial court initially granted the petition. The Government appealed but later withdrew the appeal after Syson moved for a rehearing and presented testimony claiming his two undisclosed children had died in China. Two years later, the trial court allowed Syson to take his oath of allegiance. The Government appealed this order, arguing the decision never became final and Syson failed to meet the statutory requirements.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner is qualified to become a Filipino citizen despite the alleged defects in his petition regarding his children, residence, language, and income.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision and cancelled the petitioner's naturalization certificate.

1.  **Disclosure of Children:** The petitioner failed to state the truth about the number of his living children. Documentary evidence, such as birth certificates of his later children, indicated he had "5" or "6" living children, contradicting his claim that the two undisclosed children had died. This failure to make a full disclosure indicates he is not possessed of the **irreproachable character** required by law [1-3].
2.  **Residence:** The petitioner failed to allege all his former places of residence (specifically in Dagupan and other addresses in Manila) as admitted in his sworn statement to the NBI. This violation of **Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law** is a fatal defect that warrants dismissal and affects the jurisdiction of the court [4, 5].
3.  **Language:** The petitioner failed to meet the language requirement. The record showed that while he could answer simple questions from his counsel in Spanish, he could not answer those propounded by the Court, proving he did not speak the language [4, 6].
4.  **Lucrative Income:** A net annual income of P8,114.57 is not sufficient to be considered a **lucrative trade or profession** for an applicant with a wife and five children to support [7, 8].

The decision granting naturalization was reversed, the petition dismissed, and the oath of allegiance declared without force and effect [9].
