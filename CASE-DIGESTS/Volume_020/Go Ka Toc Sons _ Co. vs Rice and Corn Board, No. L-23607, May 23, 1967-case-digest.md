**I. CAPTION**
**GO KA TOC SONS & CO. v. RICE AND CORN BOARD**, G.R. No. L-23607, May 23, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Go Ka Toc Sons & Co. is a partnership not wholly owned by Filipinos, engaged in manufacturing vegetable oil from corn and rice. Following the enactment of Republic Act No. 3018, which prohibited aliens from engaging in the "rice and/or corn industry," the partnership stopped trading in rice and corn but continued processing and trading "by-products" (specifically "tahup", "sungo", and rice husk) to manufacture oil and "corn meal." The Rice and Corn Board (RICOB) issued Resolution No. 10 and Gen. Circular No. 1, defining "by-products" to include these materials. Go Ka Toc filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to declare the law and regulations inapplicable to its business. The CFI ruled in favor of Go Ka Toc, declaring the RICOB regulations void and issuing an injunction, reasoning that the legislative intent did not cover by-products and that their inclusion would violate the constitutional requirement regarding the law's title. RICOB appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Go Ka Toc Sons & Co.'s business of processing and trading rice and corn by-products is covered by the prohibition in R.A. No. 3018.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court reversed the lower court's decision. Section 1 of R.A. No. 3018 explicitly defines "rice and/or corn industry" to include the "acquisition for the purpose of trade of rice... or corn and the by-products thereof." The materials used by the petitioner ("tahup", "sungo") and its produce ("corn meal") are clearly by-products [1-3]. The Court held that where the law is clear, the court's duty is to apply it, not to interpret it (*People v. Garcia*); resorting to statutory construction to determine "intent" was improper [4]. Furthermore, the inclusion of "by-products" in the text is valid because it is germane to the subject matter expressed in the title of the law (*Sumulong v. COMELEC*) [3]. Consequently, the RICOB regulations implementing the law were valid exercises of authority under Section 6 of the Act [5]. The judgment was reversed and the writ of injunction set aside [6].
