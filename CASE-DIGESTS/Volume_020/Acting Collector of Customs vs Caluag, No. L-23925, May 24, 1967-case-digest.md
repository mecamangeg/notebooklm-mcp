I. CAPTION
THE ACTING COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS OF THE PORT OF MANILA v. HON. HERMOGENES CALUAG, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch IV, sitting at Quezon City and CONCEPCION S. CALALANG, G.R. No. L-23925, May 24, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Robert Gibson, a US military personnel, imported a car tax-free in 1956 [1]. After several transfers, the car was sold to respondent Concepcion S. Calalang in 1963 [2]. The Land Transportation Commission certified to the Collector of Customs that the car was originally imported tax-free but transferred to non-exempt persons without payment of taxes (a "hot car") [3, 4]. Consequently, the petitioner Acting Collector of Customs issued a warrant of seizure and detention, and NBI agents seized the car from Calalang [4]. Calalang filed a petition for certiorari, mandamus, and prohibition with preliminary mandatory injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal (presided by respondent Judge Caluag) to recover the car [5]. The CFI denied the Collector's motion to dismiss based on lack of jurisdiction and granted the injunction [5]. The Acting Collector filed this petition in the Supreme Court questioning the CFI's jurisdiction [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CFI has jurisdiction to review the seizure of the car by Customs authorities.
2. W/N the respondent failed to exhaust administrative remedies, rendering the CFI petition improper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), and not the Court of First Instance, has jurisdiction to review the actuations of customs authorities with respect to an imported taxable "hot car" [7, 8]. Under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125, the CTA has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review decisions of the Commissioner of Customs involving seizure, detention, or release of property arising under the Customs Law [9, 10]. The Court held that provisions of the Tax Code imposing duties on imported merchandise are implemented by Customs authorities and thus form part of the Customs Law [11-13]. Therefore, the CFI had no jurisdiction to entertain the case or issue the writ of preliminary injunction [13].

2. **YES.** The petition for certiorari in the CFI was premature because Calalang failed to exhaust administrative remedies [12, 14]. She had the remedy of appealing to the Commissioner of Customs, filing a bond for the car's release, or filing a protest with the Collector [14, 15]. The Court ruled that certiorari is not proper when adequate administrative remedies, such as an appeal, are available [14, 16].

Petition is **GRANTED**. The Court of First Instance of Rizal is declared without jurisdiction in Civil Case No. Q-8198, and its orders and preliminary injunction writ are annulled [17].
