I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE COMPANY v. THE HON. ENRIQUE MEDINA, TELEPHONE ENGINEERING & SERVICE CO. (TESCO), TELECTRONIC SYSTEMS, INC. and ARANETA UNIVERSITY, G.R. Nos. L-24340-44, July 18, 1967, 20 SCRA 657, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
PLDT applied for authority to revise its rates and expand its capital (PSC Cases 61-5270 et al.). On July 31, 1963, the Public Service Commission (PSC) rendered a decision approving the expansion and rate increase (not exceeding 47% for business and 40% for residential), subject to specific conditions, including the connection of 5,000 new telephones in 1963. PLDT moved for reconsideration to eliminate these conditions.

On January 9, 1964, the PSC rendered an amended decision approving the expansion and definitely fixing the rate increase at 47% and 40% to take effect on January 1, 1965. This amended decision did not recite the conditions imposed in the original July 31 decision. This judgment became final.

In December 1964 and January 1965, respondents Telectronics, TESCO, and Araneta University (who was not a party to the original cases) filed petitions to suspend the effectivity of the rates and reexamine them, arguing PLDT failed to meet the July 31 conditions and that equipment prices were excessive. On February 22, 1965, Commissioner Medina issued a "Memorandum" stating that the July 31 conditions remained in force despite the amendment. Medina denied PLDT’s motion to dismiss the new petitions, claiming supervisory power to amend or revoke orders at any time. PLDT filed this petition for prohibition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the amended decision of January 9, 1964 supplanted the original decision of July 31, 1963, thereby eliminating the conditions imposed in the latter.
2. W/N the "Memorandum" issued by the Commissioner after the decision became final is valid.
3. W/N the PSC may reopen the final cases to suspend or reexamine rates upon the petition of a non-party.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The amended decision of January 9, 1964 is the final repository of the Commission's conclusions and supplanted the old decision of July 31, 1963. A comparison of the two decisions shows that the conditions underscored in the original decision were deleted in the amended one. The amended decision expressly stated the new rates were "to take effect" from January 1, 1965, implying no conditions precedent stood in the way. Since the amended decision stated it "modifies and amends" the previous one accordingly, the conditions were effectively eliminated [1]-[2].

2. **NO.** The Memorandum is void and cannot vary the terms of the final decision. It does not partake of the nature of a *nunc pro tunc* order, which is used only to record what was actually ordered but inadvertently omitted, not to repair judicial errors or add new matter. A decision that has long become final cannot be substantially amended or made to speak a different language, even by the authors themselves. To allow this would create instability in written opinions [3]-[4].

3. **NO.** Finality must be written on PSC cases just as in judicial controversies. The rule of *non quieta movere* prescribes that proceedings already terminated should not be disturbed [5]. The Public Service Act (Sections 16 and 20) requires that any change in established rates must be done through a *new* proceeding with proper notice and hearing [6]-[7]. Furthermore, Araneta University was not a party to the original rate-fixing cases and thus had no standing to move for reconsideration or appeal. To reexamine rates, a new case must be filed to afford the public and competitors due notice and opportunity to be heard.

The petition for prohibition is GRANTED. Commissioner Medina is ordered to desist from further hearing the petitions for suspension and reexamination of rates [8].
