I. CAPTION
THE EMBROIDERY AND APPAREL CONTROL AND INSPECTION BOARD and THE SECRETARY OF FINANCE vs. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL and CECILIO RAFAEL, G.R. No. L-20024, June 30, 1967, 20 SCRA 517, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Cecilio Rafael filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila (Civil Case No. 49087) challenging the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 3137 and seeking to enjoin the Embroidery and Apparel Control and Inspection Board (Board) from enforcing it. On March 31, 1962, respondent Judge Cloribel rendered a decision declaring Section 2 of the Act unconstitutional and perpetually enjoining the petitioners from enforcing it [1], [2].

Petitioners filed a notice of appeal to the Supreme Court on April 24, 1962. Since they were government officials appealing a special civil action, no appeal bond or record on appeal was required. The court "granted" the appeal on April 26, 1962 [3]. Subsequently, Rafael moved for a preliminary injunction *pending appeal* [4]. Despite petitioners' opposition arguing loss of jurisdiction, Judge Cloribel issued an order on June 22, 1962, granting the writ, which was issued on June 27, 1962 [5]. Petitioners filed the instant certiorari and prohibition case, arguing the lower court had lost jurisdiction upon the perfection of their appeal [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court retained jurisdiction to issue a writ of preliminary injunction pending appeal after the petitioners' appeal had been perfected.
2. W/N Section 4, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court regarding execution pending appeal in injunction cases applies to this action.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The trial court lost jurisdiction to issue the writ. In a prohibition case involving government officials sued in their official capacities, the appeal is perfected by the mere filing of the notice of appeal [7], [8]. Upon perfection, the trial court is divested of jurisdiction, except to issue orders for the protection of rights *not involved* in the matter litigated by the appeal [9], [10]. Here, the preliminary injunction pending appeal did not merely preserve the *status quo* but involved the very matter litigated—the enforcement of the law—and constituted an advance execution of the judgment being appealed [11], [12].

2. **NO.** The action filed by Rafael was for prohibition, not a simple injunction suit, as it questioned the jurisdiction of a quasi-judicial body (the Board) and the constitutionality of RA 3137 [13], [14]. Consequently, Section 4 of Rule 39 (now Rule 39, Sec. 4), which allows the trial court to grant or suspend an injunction during the pendency of an appeal in *injunction* actions, does not apply to an action for *prohibition* [15], [14].

**Petition granted.** The orders dated June 22 and 30, 1962, and the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the respondent Judge are declared null and void [16].
