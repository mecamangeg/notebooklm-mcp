I. CAPTION
NATIONAL SHIPYARDS & STEEL CORPORATION v. CABIDAD J. TORRENTO and MUTUAL SECURITY INSURANCE CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-21109, June 26, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Torrento purchased steel bars on credit from National Shipyards & Steel Corporation (NASSCO). To secure the credit, Torrento (as principal) and Mutual Security Insurance Corporation (as surety) executed a surety bond, binding themselves jointly and severally to NASSCO. During the contract implementation, NASSCO ran out of the specific 3/8" steel bars stipulated. NASSCO and Torrento executed a supplemental agreement to deliver 1/2" and 5/8" bars instead at slightly different prices, without the surety's knowledge or consent. When Torrento failed to pay, NASSCO sued both her and the surety. The lower court ordered them to pay jointly and severally. Torrento argued the action should be against the surety, while the surety argued it was released from liability due to the material alteration of the contract.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the creditor can proceed against the principal debtor directly despite the existence of a surety bond.
2. W/N the surety was released from liability due to the execution of the supplemental agreement without its consent.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the creditor may sue the principal debtor and the surety separately or together. The surety bond expressly stated that the parties bound themselves "jointly and severally." Under Article 2047 of the Civil Code, when a person binds himself solidarily with the principal debtor, the contract is one of suretyship, and the provisions on solidary obligations apply. Article 1216 of the Civil Code allows the creditor to proceed against any of the solidary debtors or all of them simultaneously [1].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the supplemental agreement did not constitute a material alteration sufficient to release the surety. For a surety to be released, the change must impose a new obligation or change the legal effect of the original contract. Here, the quantity, length, and quality of the steel bars remained the same; only the diameter and unit price changed slightly. Citing *Pacific Tobacco Corporation v. Lorenzana* and *Visayan Distributors, Inc. v. Flores*, the Court held that a surety is not released by a change in the contract which does not have the effect of making its obligation more onerous [2-4].

Decision affirmed.
