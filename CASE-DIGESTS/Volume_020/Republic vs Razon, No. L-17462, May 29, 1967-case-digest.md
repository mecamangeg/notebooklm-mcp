I. CAPTION
Republic of the Philippines v. Jose Razon and Jai-Alai Corporation, G.R. Nos. L-17462 & L-17472, May 29, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Haig Assadourian, an Egyptian citizen and former general manager of Jai-Alai Corporation, left the Philippines for the United States in 1946. In 1947, Jai-Alai Corporation agreed to pay him PHP 200,000.00 in settlement of his claim for "percentages" or management fees earned from the corporation's profits. The payment was made in installments: PHP 40,000.00 was sent directly by Jai-Alai to Assadourian in California via telegraphic transfer, while the remaining PHP 160,000.00 was paid to Jose Razon, who was both the Vice-President of Jai-Alai and Assadourian's attorney-in-fact. Razon then remitted these amounts to Assadourian. Notably, some installment payments were advanced by Madrigal & Co., Inc. and charged to the personal account of Vicente Madrigal, the controlling stockholder of both Jai-Alai and Madrigal & Co.

The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) assessed withholding income tax on the PHP 200,000.00, classifying Assadourian as a non-resident alien not engaged in trade or business. The Republic sued Jai-Alai and Razon to collect the taxes. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled that Jai-Alai was liable only for the tax on PHP 80,000.00 and dismissed the case against Razon. Both parties appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Haig Assadourian was a non-resident alien not engaged in trade or business subject to withholding tax.
2. W/N the payments constituted taxable income or a sale of inchoate interest.
3. W/N Jai-Alai Corporation and Jose Razon are liable as withholding agents, despite the intervention of Madrigal & Co. in some payments.
4. W/N the government's right to collect the tax has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held it is bound by the CTA’s factual finding that Assadourian was a non-resident alien not engaged in trade or business in the Philippines, as this finding was supported by substantial evidence [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The PHP 200,000.00 payments were for "percentages" or income earned by Assadourian from Jai-Alai's profits, not for the sale of an inchoate interest. Under Section 53(b) of the National Internal Revenue Code, such "fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, and income" are subject to withholding tax [3, 4].

3. **YES.** Jai-Alai is the withholding agent for the entire PHP 200,000.00. Regarding the payments made ostensibly by Madrigal & Co., the Court applied the doctrine of **piercing the veil of corporate fiction**. Since Vicente Madrigal controlled both companies and the amounts were charged to his personal account, the payments were effectively made by Jai-Alai [5, 6].

   Jose Razon is also a withholding agent, solidarily liable with Jai-Alai, but only for the PHP 160,000.00 he actually handled. He possessed a dual personality as Jai-Alai's VP and Assadourian's attorney-in-fact, giving him custody and control over those specific funds [3, 7, 8].

4. **NO.** The action has not prescribed. Since no withholding tax return was filed for the payments, the period to collect by judicial proceeding is ten years from the discovery of the omission pursuant to Section 332(c) of the Tax Code. The omission was discovered in 1949 and the suit was filed in 1953, well within the period [9, 10].

Decision modified. Jai-Alai is liable for the withholding tax on the full PHP 200,000.00. The Intestate Estate of Jose Razon is solidarily liable with Jai-Alai for the tax on the PHP 160,000.00. Both are liable for surcharges and 1% monthly interest [11, 12].
