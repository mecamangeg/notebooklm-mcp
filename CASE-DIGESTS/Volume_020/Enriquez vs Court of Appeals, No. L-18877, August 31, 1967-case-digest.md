I. CAPTION
HON. JUAN P. ENRIQUEZ, et al. v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS, et al., G.R. No. L-18877, August 31, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Two factions, the Chaves group (respondents) and the Fermin group (petitioners), contested the positions of board directors and officers of a corporation. The Chaves group filed Civil Case No. 42650, labeled as a complaint for "Injunction," seeking to restrain the Fermin group from acting as officers [1, 2]. The Fermin group filed Civil Case No. 42704 for "Quo Warranto" against the Chaves group [3].

Judge Juan P. Enriquez tried the cases jointly. On January 13, 1961, he rendered a decision dismissing the Chaves group's injunction case (No. 42650) and granting the Fermin group's quo warranto petition (No. 42704), declaring the Fermin group the lawful officers [1]. The Chaves group filed an appeal after the 15-day reglementary period prescribed for *quo warranto* proceedings but within the 30-day period for ordinary civil actions [4]. Judge Enriquez denied the appeal for being late.

The Chaves group filed a petition for *mandamus* with the Court of Appeals (CA) to compel the judge to give due course to the appeal. The CA granted the *mandamus*, ruling that Case No. 42650 was an action for injunction, not *quo warranto*, and thus the appeal was timely perfected within the 30-day period [4, 5]. The Fermin group and Judge Enriquez filed this petition for review.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Civil Case No. 42650 was a *quo warranto* proceeding subject to the 15-day appeal period.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CA, holding that Civil Case No. 42650 was in the nature of a *quo warranto* proceeding [6, 7]. Although labeled as an action for injunction, the prayer was predicated on the allegation that the Chaves group were the duly elected officers and that the Fermin group was unlawfully holding office [2]. An injunctive relief is often sought in *quo warranto* proceedings as a means to enforce the respective titles of the claimants [6, 7].

Where the main issue is the title or right to a public or corporate office, the action is *quo warranto*, and the injunction is merely auxiliary or in aid of the declaration of lack of title of the opponents [8]. Since the judgment was not appealed within the 15-day reglementary period provided for *quo warranto* cases under the old Rules of Court, the decision became final and executory [9]. Consequently, *mandamus* cannot lie to compel the court to give due course to a belated appeal.

The petition is granted, the Court of Appeals decision is reversed, and the writ of mandamus is denied [10].
