I. CAPTION
HON. FERNANDO T. BERNAD, as City Mayor of Ozamis City, et al. v. HON. ALFREDO CATOLICO, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental, Branch I, G.R. No. L-25860, June 29, 1967, 20 SCRA 498, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On March 11, 1966, Respondent Judge Catolico issued an order directing Petitioners (the Mayor, Vice-Mayor, and Councilors of Ozamis City) to provide a "detention cell" for and maintain provincial prisoners facing trial in Branch II of the Court of First Instance. He warned that failure to comply by March 18 would result in contempt of court citations.

Petitioners filed an answer asserting that the duty to maintain provincial prisoners devolved upon the provincial government, not the city. Although the City Board offered the temporary use of a cell as a gesture of cooperation, they maintained they had no legal obligation. Respondent Judge continued with the contempt proceedings. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court, which issued a cease-and-desist order on March 25, 1966. Subsequently, on March 26, the Respondent Judge signed an order dropping the contempt charges, citing the city's "cooperation," though this order remained unpromulgated due to the SC's restraining order.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the officials of Ozamis City have the legal duty to provide a detention cell for and maintain provincial prisoners.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the City of Ozamis has no legal obligation to provide for provincial prisoners.

The Court held that the Ozamis City Charter (Republic Act No. 321) enumerates the specific powers of the municipal board, such as establishing schools and markets, but excludes the duty to establish detention cells for provincial prisoners. Implicit in this exclusion is that the obligation is withheld. Furthermore, the Revised Administrative Code (RAC) explicitly places the burden on the province. Sections 1729 and 1740 of the RAC mandate that provinces maintain jails at their respective capitals for provincial prisoners at their own expense. Section 1744 distinguishes responsibility based on the prisoner's category: municipal prisoners are maintained by the city/municipality, provincial prisoners by the province, and national prisoners by the Bureau of Prisons. Finally, Section 2288 of the RAC restricts municipal funds to "local public purposes."

Since no legal duty exists, the Respondent Judge acted without jurisdiction in ordering the Petitioners to provide the facilities and in initiating contempt proceedings. Where no legal duty is imposed, no legal obligation exists.

The Respondent Judge's order of March 11, 1966, was declared null and void. However, as the Judge had effectively dropped the contempt charges in his unpromulgated March 26 order, the petition was **DISMISSED** for being moot.
