I. CAPTION
ALFREDO B. GRAFIL and LRM MINING COMPANY v. THE HON. JOSE Y. FELICIANO, as Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, THE HON. FERNANDO S. BUSUEGO, as Director of Mines, and MANILA MINING CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-27156, June 30, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Grafil and LRM Mining Company filed a petition for review in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan contesting the decision of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources regarding conflicting mining claims [1, 2]. The CFI dismissed the case on May 8, 1965, for lack of jurisdiction [2]. Petitioners' counsel, Atty. Montilla, received the dismissal order on May 28, 1965, and filed a motion for reconsideration on June 9, 1965 [3, 4].

The CFI denied the motion on July 10, 1965 [3]. A copy of this order was sent to Atty. Montilla by registered mail [3]. The postmaster sent three notices to counsel on July 27, August 9, and August 17, 1965, but counsel failed to claim the mail, causing it to be returned to the court [3]. Atty. Montilla only claimed the mail on February 25, 1966, and filed an appeal on February 28, 1966 [5]. Respondent Manila Mining Corporation moved to dismiss the appeal for being filed out of time, arguing the order had become final [4, 5]. Atty. Montilla denied receiving the notices and cited a transfer of office, though the transfer notice was dated August 30, after the notices were sent [5-7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal was perfected within the reglementary period despite the counsel's failure to claim the registered mail containing the denial of the motion for reconsideration.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The appeal was not perfected on time. Under Section 8 of Rule 13 of the Rules of Court, service by registered mail is complete upon actual receipt by the addressee, or if he fails to claim his mail from the post office within five (5) days from the date of the first notice of the postmaster, service shall take effect at the expiration of such time [4].

In this case, the first notice was sent on July 27, 1965. Since counsel failed to claim the mail, service was deemed complete five days later, on August 2, 1965 [4]. The filing of the motion for reconsideration suspended the 30-day appeal period, leaving the petitioners with 18 days remaining [4]. Counting from the constructive receipt on August 2, the period to appeal expired on August 20, 1965 [4]. Consequently, the appeal filed on February 28, 1966, was late, and the order had already become final [4].

The Court further held that a lawyer's denial of receipt cannot prevail over the positive statement of the postmaster and the legal presumption that official duty was regularly performed [6, 8]. The alleged transfer of office was rejected as an excuse because it occurred after the notices were sent [7].

Appeal dismissed [7].
