I. CAPTION
JULIA DE LA MERCED, ET AL. v. THE ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP OF MANILA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-24614, August 17, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners (lessees) filed a complaint against respondent Archbishop (lessor) to fix the duration of their lease on a parcel of land in Paco, Manila. Through their counsel, the parties submitted a "Compromise Agreement" leaving the lease period to the trial court's discretion and stipulating that petitioners would vacate after said period or forfeit their improvements. The trial court approved the agreement and fixed the lease term at 18 months. Six months later, respondent moved for execution due to non-payment of rentals. Petitioners, through new counsel, opposed the execution, arguing that the "compromise" was unauthorized by them and they would not have agreed to its terms had they been informed. The trial court overruled the objection and ordered execution.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the agreement entered into by the counsel was a true compromise requiring special authority from the clients.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the agreement was not a true compromise, the essence of which resides in reciprocal concessions under Article 2028 of the Civil Code. The Court found that the concessions were solely on the part of the respondent lessor. First, the lease period was not settled by the parties but was an independent judgment by the court under Article 1687. Second, the "forfeiture" of improvements was merely an application of Article 1678, which allows the lessor to appropriate improvements if the lessee fails to remove them. Third, the payment of rentals was a pre-existing legal obligation, not a concession. Since it was not a true compromise, the rule requiring special authority for an attorney to compromise litigation was inapplicable.

The order of execution is AFFIRMED.
