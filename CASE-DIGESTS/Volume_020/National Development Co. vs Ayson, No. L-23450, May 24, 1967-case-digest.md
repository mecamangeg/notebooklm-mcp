I. CAPTION
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY v. MAGDALENA AYSON and THE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-23450, May 24, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Magdalena Ayson was employed as a weaver by the National Development Company (NDC). She frequently worked the night shift, which involved pushing heavy wagons of cloth. In the latter part of 1952, following an accident in the course of her employment, she began spitting blood and was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). On June 30, 1953, she was discharged due to total disability. Within a week of receiving her discharge letter, Ayson requested financial benefits from NDC's Acting General Manager.

On February 27, 1961, Ayson filed a claim for disability compensation. NDC argued that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations under Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 3428) and that her illness was not work-connected. The Department of Labor hearing officer ruled in Ayson's favor, awarding P3,407.04 for compensation and P1,300.00 for medical expenses. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed the decision. NDC appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claim for compensation is barred by the statutory period for filing under Section 24 of Act No. 3428.
2. W/N Ayson's illness (PTB) is compensable.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The claim is not barred. The Court held that NDC failed to file an employer's report with notice of controversion, which constitutes a renunciation and waiver of the defense that the claim was filed outside the statutory two-month period (*National Development Co. v. WCC*, L-20504). Furthermore, Ayson substantially complied with Section 24 of Act No. 3428 by requesting financial benefits from the company within a week of her discharge. Such a request amounts to an "advanced filing" of the claim (*Saulog v. Del Rosario*, L-11504).

2. **YES.** The illness is compensable. The records showed Ayson worked night shifts pushing heavy wagons before contracting PTB, providing substantial evidence that the illness was caused by her employment. The Court applied the presumption that an illness arising in the course of employment arose *out* of it, especially in the absence of rebutting evidence from the employer (*Agustin v. WCC*, L-19957). The Court also affirmed the award of P1,300.00 for medical expenses as reasonable since Ayson was treated by a private physician.

The decision and resolution of the Workmen's Compensation Commission are affirmed.
