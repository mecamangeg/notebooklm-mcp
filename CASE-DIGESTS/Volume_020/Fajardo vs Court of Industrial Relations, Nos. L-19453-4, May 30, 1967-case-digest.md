I. CAPTION
GREGORIO E. FAJARDO v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, JOSE C. ESPINAS and SISENANDO VILLALUZ, G.R. Nos. L-19453-4, May 30, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) granted a temporary monthly salary increase of P15.00 to employees of the Manila Railroad Company affiliated with specific unions [1]. Petitioner Atty. Gregorio Fajardo, representing 138 non-union employees, filed a motion for leave to intervene, praying that the salary increase be extended to his clients [2]. The CIR initially denied the motion but, upon a motion for reconsideration filed by the intervenors through Fajardo and other counsel, the Court *en banc* allowed the intervention [2], [3], [4].

Subsequently, Fajardo and other lawyers filed a joint motion for attorney's fees [3]. The CIR issued an order granting fees to the other lawyers but denied Fajardo's claim, reasoning that his participation was limited to filing the petition to intervene after the increase had already been granted [5]. Fajardo's motion for reconsideration was denied by the CIR *en banc* [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Petitioner is entitled to attorney's fees for his legal services to the non-union employees.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner is entitled to reasonable compensation [6]. The record established that Fajardo rendered legal services to the 138 intervenors not only by filing the motion for leave to intervene but also by appearing in court on four separate occasions (November 9, 1959; December 12, 1959; March 10, 1960; and October 25, 1961), contrary to the lower court's finding that he appeared only once [6].

However, considering that his services resulted only in extending to his clients the benefits of a temporary increase already granted to the permanent employees, the Court set his fees at 2-1/2% of the total amount awarded to his clients by reason of said increase [7].

The order appealed from was modified, and the resolution denying the motion for reconsideration was set aside [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro, JJ., concurred) [8].
