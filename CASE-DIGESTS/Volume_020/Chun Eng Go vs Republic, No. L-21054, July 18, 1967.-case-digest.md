I. CAPTION
MIGUEL CHUN ENG GO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21054, July 18, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Miguel Chun Eng Go, a subject of Nationalist China born in Manila, filed a petition for naturalization. In his application, he listed his present residence at R.R. Landon St., Cebu City, and one former residence at Sikatuna St., Cebu City. However, evidence presented at trial revealed that he had other former places of residence which were not stated in the petition: he evacuated to various towns in Cebu (D. Jakosalem, Catmon, and Paknaa-an, Mandawe) during World War II, and resided in Manila for four years while attending agricultural school [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance of Cebu dismissed the petition for failure to allege all former places of residence. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the law refers only to legal residence, not physical or actual residence [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner’s failure to state all former places of actual and physical residence in the petition constitutes a fatal jurisdictional defect.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law requires a petitioner to set forth not only the present place of residence but also all "former places of residence" [3]. This inclusion is a jurisdictional requirement; failure to comply constitutes a fatal and congenital defect that cannot be cured by evidence regarding the omitted matter during the trial [5-7].

The Court rejected the argument that the law refers only to legal residence. Actual or physical residence must be stated because it is where the applicant conducts himself and where people around him can best judge his fitness for citizenship [4, 8, 9]. Omitting these places withholds full opportunity for the public to raise valid objections, effectively defeating the purpose of the law [10-12].

Decision affirmed.
