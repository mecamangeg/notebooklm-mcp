I. CAPTION
ORMOC SUGAR COMPANY, INC. v. THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF ORMOC CITY and HON. ESTEBAN C. CONEJOS, G.R. No. L-24322, July 21, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ormoc Sugar Company, Inc. filed a petition for declaratory judgment before the Court of First Instance of Leyte to challenge the validity of Municipal Ordinance No. 14, as amended by Ordinance No. 22, Series of 1964, enacted by the Municipal Board of Ormoc City [1, 2]. The ordinance imposed a local percentage tax on the production of centrifugal sugar and on the gross sales of its derivatives and by-products [3]. Petitioner argued that the ordinance suffered from constitutional and statutory infirmities and was in restraint of trade [4]. The lower court sustained the validity of the ordinance, prompting the petitioner to appeal [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the municipal ordinance imposing a tax on centrifugal sugar and its by-products is valid.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that the Local Autonomy Act (enacted June 19, 1959) considerably enlarged the taxing authority of chartered cities [5]. This authority is sufficiently plenary to cover all subjects, except those explicitly mentioned in Section 2 of the Act, provided the tax is for public purposes, just, and uniform [2, 3].

The Court held that the ordinance did not suffer from any constitutional or statutory infirmity [6]. Furthermore, the Court rejected the argument that the tax was in "restraint of trade," holding that the invocation of such a "talismanic formula" is insufficient to nullify a valid taxing ordinance without a clear showing of a transgression of a constitutional provision or controlling statute [4, 6, 7].

Judgment affirmed.
