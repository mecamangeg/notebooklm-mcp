I. CAPTION
ANTONIA MARANAN v. PASCUAL PEREZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22272, June 26, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Rogelio Corachea was a passenger in a taxicab owned and operated by Pascual Perez when he was stabbed and killed by the driver, Simeon Valenzuela, on October 18, 1960. Valenzuela was convicted of homicide in a criminal case. Rogelio’s mother, Antonia Maranan, filed an action for damages against Perez and Valenzuela for breach of contract of carriage. Perez denied liability, claiming the death was a *caso fortuito* and citing *Gillaco v. Manila Railroad Co.*, where a carrier was not held liable for a guard's intentional killing of a passenger. The Court of First Instance of Batangas ruled in favor of Maranan, awarding P3,000 in damages against Perez but dismissing the claim against the driver. Both parties appealed—Maranan seeking increased damages, and Perez insisting on non-liability.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a common carrier is liable for the intentional killing of a passenger by its employee.
2. W/N the driver is liable to the passenger's heir in an action for breach of contract of carriage.
3. W/N the amount of damages awarded by the lower court was correct.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Article 1759 of the Civil Code, common carriers are liable for the death of or injuries to passengers through the negligence or willful acts of their employees, even if such employees acted beyond the scope of their authority or in violation of orders [1, 2]. The Court distinguished this from *Gillaco*, noting that the New Civil Code expressly imposes absolute liability for employee assaults to ensure the "full measure of protection" promised by the contract of carriage [1, 3]. As between the carrier and the passenger, the former must bear the risk of wrongful acts by employees it has the power to select and remove [3].

2. **NO.** The driver was not a party to the contract of carriage; thus, he cannot be held liable for its breach. His civil liability is covered by the judgment of conviction in the criminal case [4, 5].

3. **NO.** The award was insufficient. The Court increased the compensatory damages to P6,000, the minimum amount recoverable under Articles 1764 and 2206 of the Civil Code for death resulting from a breach of contract [6]. Additionally, the Court awarded P3,000 in moral damages for the mental anguish suffered by the parents, plus legal interest [7, 8].

The judgment of the lower court is MODIFIED to increase the actual damages to P6,000 and award P3,000 in moral damages, with legal interest [8].
