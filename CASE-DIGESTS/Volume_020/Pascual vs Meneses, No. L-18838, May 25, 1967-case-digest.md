I. CAPTION
CARMEN M. PASCUAL, et al. v. RAMON MENESES, et al., G.R. No. L-18838, May 25, 1967, 20 SCRA 219, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
The parties are descendants of Celedonio Meneses and Ana Asuncion. Plaintiffs (Pascual, et al.) alleged that the spouses' original properties, as well as subsequent acquisitions by their son Anacleto and grandson Ramon (Defendants), formed an undivided "Komunidad ng mga Meneses" held in trust for all the heirs. Plaintiffs relied on a letter by Ramon referring to a specific residential lot as property of the "Komunidad" and oral testimony to prove the trust. They filed an action for partition and accounting of three sets of properties accumulated over generations. The Defendants (heirs of Anacleto) argued that the estate had long been partitioned and that they held exclusive title to the properties, supported by Anacleto’s possessory title since 1894 and various deeds of sale from other heirs. The Court of First Instance of Bulacan ruled in favor of the Plaintiffs, ordering partition and accounting. Defendants appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the properties in dispute form an undivided community held in express trust for all the heirs.
2. W/N the cross-claimant Asuncion Meneses had already received her share of the inheritance.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that no express trust concerning an immovable or any interest therein may be proved by parol evidence (Article 1443, Civil Code). The Plaintiffs' reliance on oral testimony to prove the trust over the extensive properties was insufficient. Regarding the letter mentioning a "Komunidad," the Court ruled that a reference to a co-ownership over a single residential lot does not establish co-dominion over sixty-five other distinct properties. Furthermore, documentary evidence, such as Ana Asuncion's 1895 will describing herself as owner (not co-owner) and deeds of sale executed by other heirs in 1900-1912, proved that the estate had already been partitioned. The fact that Anacleto and his heirs possessed the properties exclusively for over 50 years without complaint from the other heirs raised a strong presumption that the latter had already received their shares.

2. **YES.** The records show that the estates of Anacleto Meneses and his wife Trinidad Ramos were the subject of judicial partitions (Special Proceedings No. 1358 and No. 270). Asuncion Meneses participated in these proceedings, signed a "statement of receipt" acknowledging possession of her shares in 1947, and subsequently secured Torrens titles and mortgaged the properties adjudicated to her.

**Disposition:** The judgment is MODIFIED. The cross-claim of Asuncion Meneses is dismissed. The Defendants-Appellants are absolved from the complaint, except regarding the specific residential lot (subdivision I[d], Par. 10) admitted to be co-owned, for which the decision is affirmed.
