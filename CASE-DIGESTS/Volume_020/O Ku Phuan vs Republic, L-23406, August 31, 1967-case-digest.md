I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF O KU PHUAN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. O KU PHUAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-23406, August 31, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On September 6, 1961, the Court of First Instance of Manila granted O Ku Phuan’s application for naturalization. Two years later, on November 22, 1963, petitioner moved to set a date for the taking of his oath of allegiance [1]. The Solicitor General objected, arguing that the petitioner lacked a lucrative income, failed to list all former residences, used an unauthorized alias, and presented disqualified character witnesses [2].

Evidence showed petitioner supported a wife and four children on an annual income ranging from P3,212.55 to P4,225.75 (1957–1962) as a cargo solicitor [3]. His 1963 income purportedly increased but included commissions and scholarships [4]. Additionally, his petition only listed his residence at Sta. Cruz, Manila, omitting prior residences in Davao, Tondo, and Caloocan [5]. He also used the alias "O Tiong Kiat" in official documents without judicial authority [6]. Despite these objections, the lower court authorized the oath-taking. The Solicitor General appealed [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the failure to state all former places of residence is fatal to the petition.
3. W/N the unauthorized use of an alias warrants the denial of the petition.
4. W/N matters decided in the original grant of naturalization can be revisited during the oath-taking stage.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Considering petitioner has a wife and four children, an annual income of P3,000 to P4,000 is not lucrative [3]. Commissions are generally excluded from this determination due to their unstable and irregular nature [7], [4]. Furthermore, qualifications must be determined as of the date of filing (1959) and cannot be cured by subsequent income increases [8].

2. **YES.** The failure to mention former residences affects the jurisdiction of the court to hear the case [7], [5]. Such omission defeats the purpose of publication and deprives the Government of the opportunity to conduct a thorough investigation into the petitioner's background [9].

3. **YES.** The petitioner used the alias "O Tiong Kiat" in his declaration of intention and clearances without prior judicial authority, violating the Anti-Alias Law (Commonwealth Act No. 142) [6]. The unlawful use of an alias suffices to warrant the denial of a petition for naturalization [10], [6].

4. **YES.** A naturalization case is not an ordinary action. The statutory provision requiring a two-year intervening period before the decision becomes executory implies that matters covered by the initial decision may still be taken up and reviewed during the subsequent oath-taking proceedings [11], [12].

The order appealed from is **REVERSED** and the application for naturalization is **DISMISSED** [13].
