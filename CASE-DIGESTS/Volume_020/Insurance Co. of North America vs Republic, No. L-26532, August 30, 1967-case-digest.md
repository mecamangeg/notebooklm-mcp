I. CAPTION
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-26532, August 30, 1967, 20 SCRA 1159, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellant Insurance Company of North America filed a suit against the Republic and the Bureau of Customs to recover P1,543.58, representing the value of goods received by the Customs Arrastre Service but not delivered to the consignee. The Supreme Court previously rendered a decision based on *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service*, ruling that the plaintiff should have filed its claim with the General Auditing Office under Commonwealth Act No. 327 rather than filing a direct suit. The plaintiff filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the Auditor General has no jurisdiction because the claim is "unliquidated" and the Government's liability is in issue, citing *Compañia General de Tabacos v. French* [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claim for the value of lost goods is a "liquidated claim" within the jurisdiction of the Auditor General.
2. W/N a direct suit against the State is proper in this case.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A liquidated claim within the power of the Auditor General to decide under Act No. 3083 and Commonwealth Act No. 327 is a claim for money where the amount is fixed or can be readily determined from vouchers, reports, or other means within the reach of accounting officers [2]. The Court held that the claim for P1,543.58 is fixed and determinable from accessible shipping papers and invoices, and does not require deep discretion to appreciate [2]. Furthermore, a claim does not become unliquidated merely because the Government denies liability; the Auditor General has the power to pass upon the issue of liability and decide whether to allow or reject the claim [3].

2. **NO.** A direct suit against the State cannot be maintained without its consent [4]. The Court emphasized that the principal issue is the suability of the State, and regardless of the procedure for filing money claims, the State's immunity from suit bars the action [4].

The Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED [4].
