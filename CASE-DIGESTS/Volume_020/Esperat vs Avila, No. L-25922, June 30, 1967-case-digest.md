I. CAPTION
ANTONIO T. ESPERAT v. THE HON. DAVID P. AVILA, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Cotabato, First Branch, and the CITY FISCAL OF COTABATO CITY, G.R. No. L-25922, June 30, 1967, 20 SCRA 596, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Antonio T. Esperat, the Deputy Chief of Police of Cotabato City, was charged with grave coercion in the City Court of Cotabato for forcibly dragging one Zoe Cordero against his will on June 28, 1965 [1]. The City Court convicted Esperat, sentencing him to imprisonment of one month and one day of *arresto mayor* and a fine of P100.00 [1]. Esperat appealed the conviction to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cotabato [1]. The prosecution objected to the CFI's jurisdiction, arguing that the crime falls under the concurrent jurisdiction of the City Court and the CFI, and thus the appeal should be filed directly with the Court of Appeals [1]. Respondent Judge Avila sustained the objection and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction [1]. Esperat filed a petition for *certiorari* and *mandamus* with the Supreme Court, arguing that the City Court had exclusive original jurisdiction [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has appellate jurisdiction over a grave coercion case decided by a City Court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court interpreted Sections 44(f) and 87(c) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 (R.A. 296), as amended, to define the jurisdictions of the courts [4, 5]. The Court ruled that the *exclusive* original jurisdiction of municipal and city courts is limited to cases where the penalty is imprisonment for 6 months or less, or a fine of P200.00 or less [6]. The Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) retains original jurisdiction where the penalty exceeds 6 months imprisonment or the fine exceeds P200.00 [7, 8]. Consequently, a "zone of concurrent jurisdiction" exists where the penalty is imprisonment greater than 6 months but not exceeding 3 years (or 6 years for city courts), or a fine greater than P200.00 but not exceeding P3,000.00 (or P6,000.00) [6, 8].

The crime of grave coercion is punishable by *arresto mayor* (imprisonment up to 6 months) and a fine not exceeding P500.00 [9]. Because the fine exceeds P200.00, the offense falls within the concurrent jurisdiction of the City Court and the CFI [9]. Under Section 87 of the Judiciary Act, cases falling under this concurrent jurisdiction tried by the City Court are appealable directly to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, not the CFI [6, 10]. The Court noted that for such direct appeals to be valid, the proceedings must be recorded; otherwise, the trial is a nullity [9].

The petition was **DENIED** [11].
