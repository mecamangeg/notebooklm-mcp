I. CAPTION
PELAGIA PUGUID v. CIRILO REYES, G.R. No. L-21311, August 10, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On June 7, 1962, petitioner Puguid filed a petition under Section 112 of the Land Registration Act (Act No. 496) in the Court of First Instance of Cagayan, sitting as a Cadastral Court. She sought the surrender of the owner's duplicate of Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 316 registered to respondent Reyes. Puguid alleged that a pre-war court order from 1939 (Order No. 7925) had directed the cancellation of Reyes' OCT and the issuance of new titles, including one in her name.

Reyes opposed the petition, arguing prescription, the nullity of the 1939 Order for being issued in excess of jurisdiction, and the sale of portions of the land to innocent purchasers. On October 19, 1962, the lower court dismissed the petition, ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the matter because the issues raised were controversial and beyond the scope of a summary proceeding under Section 112.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance, acting as a Cadastral Court, has jurisdiction to entertain a petition under Section 112 of the Land Registration Act when there is a serious controversy or adverse claim.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. Under the doctrine established in *Tangunan v. Republic* (94 Phil. 171), relief under Section 112 of Act No. 496 can only be granted if there is unanimity among the parties or if there is no adverse claim or serious objection.

The proceedings under the Land Registration Act are summary in nature and are inadequate for litigating issues properly pertaining to ordinary civil actions. Since Reyes raised serious objections involving ownership, the validity of the 1939 order, and rights of third parties, the case became controversial. Such questions must be ventilated in an ordinary proceeding rather than a summary petition.

The appealed order of dismissal is AFFIRMED.
