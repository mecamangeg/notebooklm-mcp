I. CAPTION
ROSITA C. TALEON and MIGUEL SOLIS v. THE SECRETARY OF PUBLIC WORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS, THE DISTRICT ENGINEER, Province of Davao, and LUCIA O. TOLENTINO, G.R. No. L-24281, May 16, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Taleon and Solis constructed dams and fishpond dikes on a parcel of registered land in Lupon, Davao. Respondent Tolentino filed a complaint with the Secretary of Public Works, alleging that these constructions obstructed the Cabatan River, a public navigable stream, depriving residents of passageway and fishing grounds. Petitioners claimed the dams were built inside their registered private property and that the water was a man-made canal.

After an administrative hearing, the Secretary of Public Works issued a decision on July 11, 1961, finding the dams obstructed the Cabatan River and ordering their demolition. This was affirmed by the Office of the President. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI dismissed the petition based on the pleadings and administrative records, ruling that the administrative decision was supported by evidence. Petitioners appealed, arguing the CFI erred in not granting a full trial to allow them to present evidence *aliunde* proving the water was merely a depression and not a river.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Secretary of Public Works has jurisdiction to declare a body of water inside a Torrens titled property as a public navigable stream.
2. W/N the trial court erred in dismissing the case without a trial *de novo*.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Secretary of Public Works is empowered under Republic Act No. 2056 to declare as a public navigable stream any alleged depression or body of water even if located inside titled properties [1, 2]. This fact-finding power is merely incidental to the Secretary's duty to clear all navigable streams of unauthorized obstructions and does not constitute an unlawful delegation of judicial power [2, 3]. Citing *Lovina v. Moreno*, the Court held that although a Torrens title is silent as to the existence of a stream inside private land, this does not confer a right to the stream, as it is of a public nature and not subject to private appropriation or prescription [4-6].

2. **NO.** A review of an administrative finding is limited to the evidence already presented before the administrative body; trial *de novo* is not allowed [5, 6]. The trial court's function is limited to determining whether there is evidence in the administrative records substantial enough to support the findings therein [5, 7]. Since the administrative records were submitted to the court and found to contain substantial evidence supporting the Secretary's findings, a full trial was not needed [3].

The petition was denied, and the judgment affirmed [8].
