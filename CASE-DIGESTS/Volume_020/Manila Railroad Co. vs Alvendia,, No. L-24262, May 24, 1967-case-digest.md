I. CAPTION
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and MANILA PORT SERVICE v. THE HON. CARMELINO G. ALVENDIA, Judge, Court of First Instance of Manila, THE HON. ESTRELLA ABAD SANTOS, Judge, City Court of Manila, Branch III and EMPIRE INSURANCE COMPANY, G.R. No. L-24262, May 24, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Empire Insurance Co., as subrogee of consignees, filed a suit in the City Court of Manila against the Manila Railroad Company (MRR) for the recovery of sums involving short deliveries of shipments [1]. MRR was sued for acts performed through its agent and subsidiary, the Manila Port Service (MPS) [1]. The City Court rendered judgment against MRR [2]. MRR appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, but the appeal bond was filed by MPS [2]. The CFI dismissed the appeal on the ground that MPS was not a party in the inferior court, and thus the bond was invalid [3]. MRR sought to appeal this dismissal, but the bond was again filed by MPS, leading to the refusal of the appeal [3, 4]. Consequently, MRR and MPS filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal bond filed by the Manila Port Service is valid to perfect the appeal of the Manila Railroad Company.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal of the appeal was erroneous [5]. In arrastre cases, the Manila Port Service must be regarded as part of the Manila Railroad Company, having no distinct juridical personality from the latter [5]. Therefore, the filing of an appeal bond by MPS is perforce an act of the Manila Railroad Company, not that of a separate entity [6, 7]. The Court granted the petition, set aside the CFI's dismissal, and ordered the respondent Judge to decide the case on the merits [8].
