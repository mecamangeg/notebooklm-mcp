I. CAPTION
CAUSAPIENCIA CLEMENTE, ET AL. v. H. E. HEACOCK CO., ET AL., G.R. No. L-23212, May 18, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Juan J. Clemente, the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners, mortgaged three parcels of land to respondent H.E. Heacock Co. to guarantee payment for consigned goods. Upon Clemente's failure to pay, Heacock filed a foreclosure suit (Civil Case No. 947). The trial court ordered foreclosure, and the properties were sold at public auction to Heacock as the highest bidder. The court confirmed the sale on September 17, 1956.

Clemente previously filed suits challenging the sale: Civil Case No. 4365 (questioning Heacock's subsequent sale to the De Guzman spouses), which was dismissed on the ground of *res judicata* and affirmed by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-12786; and an appeal of the confirmation order itself, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-15233.

After Juan Clemente died, his heirs (petitioners) filed the present complaint (Civil Case No. Q-5894) seeking to annul the foreclosure sale. They argued that Heacock had no corporate authority to acquire lands and that the price was unconscionably low. The lower court dismissed the complaint on the ground of *res judicata*.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the present action to annul the foreclosure sale is barred by *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal, holding that the present case is barred by the judgments in the prior foreclosure and annulment cases (Civil Case Nos. 947 and 4365).

The Court reasoned that the foreclosure proceedings resolved two issues: (1) the existence of the debt and default, and (2) the validity of the sale to the mortgagee-purchaser. The validity of the sale necessarily involved the capacity of the purchaser (Heacock) to acquire the land. The confirmation order concluded all future controversies regarding the sale, including the issue of corporate capacity [1]. Since the petitioners' predecessor never contested Heacock's corporate capacity during the foreclosure proceedings—where it should have been raised—the defense was deemed waived [2].

The Court applied the principle that a change in the remedy sought or in the form of action is no bar to *res judicata* [3]. As the confirmation of the sale was already final and upheld by superior courts, the petitioners lost all standing to question the sale or subsequent transfers.
