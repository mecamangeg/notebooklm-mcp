I. CAPTION
ERMITA-MALATE HOTEL AND MOTEL OPERATORS ASSOCIATION, INC., HOTEL DEL MAR, INC. and GO CHIU v. THE HONORABLE CITY MAYOR OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-24693, July 31, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On June 13, 1963, the Municipal Board of Manila enacted Ordinance No. 4760 to regulate hotels and motels. The ordinance increased annual license fees (up to ₱6,000.00 for first-class motels), required guests to fill out detailed registration forms open to public inspection, prohibited letting rooms more than twice every 24 hours, and banned minors unless accompanied by parents [1-3]. Petitioners, an association of hotel/motel operators and a corporation, filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, arguing the ordinance was unconstitutional for being unreasonable, violative of due process, and vague [2, 4]. The CFI, deciding solely on a stipulation of facts without other evidence, declared the ordinance null and void for being violative of due process [5, 6]. The City Mayor appealed [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Ordinance No. 4760 is unconstitutional for being violative of the due process clause.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision.

The Court held that the ordinance is a valid exercise of **police power**, designed to safeguard public morals against the "alarming increase" in prostitution and immorality in motels [8]. The Court applied the **presumption of validity** inherent in legislative acts (including municipal ordinances), stating that an ordinance cannot be lightly set aside without clear evidence of the invasion of rights [9]. Since the case was decided without evidence to the contrary, the presumption prevailed [10].

Regarding the specific objections:
1.  **License Fees**: Municipal corporations have wide discretion to fix license fees for "non-useful" enterprises (like motels) to regulate or discourage them, and for revenue. The fees were not oppressive [11].
2.  **Due Process**: The regulations (registration forms, rental limits) were not arbitrary but reasonably related to the objective of curbing immorality [12]. Individual liberty and property rights must yield to the general welfare [12].
3.  **Vagueness**: The ordinance was not void for vagueness as it did not require men of common intelligence to guess at its meaning [13].

The judgment of the lower court was reversed and the injunction lifted [14].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, and Angeles concurred [15].
