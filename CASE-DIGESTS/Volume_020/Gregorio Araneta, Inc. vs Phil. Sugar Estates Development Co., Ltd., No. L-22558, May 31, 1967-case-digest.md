I. CAPTION
GREGORIO ARANETA, INC. v. THE PHILIPPINE SUGAR ESTATES DEVELOPMENT CO., LTD., G.R. No. L-22558, May 31, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc., through petitioner Gregorio Araneta, Inc., sold a parcel of land in Quezon City to respondent Philippine Sugar Estates Development Co., Ltd. The contract stipulated that respondent would build the Sto. Domingo Church and Convent, while petitioner would construct streets surrounding the block, including Sto. Domingo Avenue [1, 2]. Respondent finished the church, but petitioner could not complete the avenue because a squatter, Manuel Abundo, refused to vacate the area [2].

Respondent filed a complaint for specific performance and damages. Petitioner argued the action was premature as the obligation had no definite period. The lower court initially dismissed the complaint but, upon motion for reconsideration, issued an amended decision fixing a two-year period for petitioner to comply [3-5]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the courts properly fixed the period of performance at two years under Article 1197 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the decision. The Court held that Article 1197 involves a two-step process: first, the court must determine that the obligation does not fix a period but that one was intended; second, the court must decide what period was "probably contemplated by the parties" [7]. The courts cannot arbitrarily fix a period they deem reasonable "out of thin air" [7].

In this case, the parties were aware that the land was occupied by squatters [8]. Since they knew eviction through legal processes takes an indeterminate amount of time not within their control, the period "probably contemplated" was that performance would be deferred until the squatters were evicted [8]. Therefore, the two-year period fixed by the lower courts was unwarranted.

The petition was **GRANTED**. The decision was reversed, and the time for performance was fixed at the date all squatters on the affected areas are finally evicted [9].
