I. CAPTION
POLICARPIO REAL v. JESSIE TROUTH-MAN, G.R. No. L-23074, May 24, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On May 22, 1964, petitioner Policarpio Real filed a petition for habeas corpus in the Court of First Instance of Manila against respondent Jessie Trouthman, a married man. Real alleged that Trouthman detained his daughter, Lilian Real, by persuading her through deceit and force to elope on May 6, 1964, in violation of Article 403 of the Civil Code [1, 2].

Respondent denied the allegations, stating Lilian went with him voluntarily. During the hearing, the trial court found that Lilian had attained the age of majority on May 16, 1964, and manifested that she joined the respondent freely and was unwilling to return to her parents. Finding no restraint of liberty, the lower court dismissed the petition. Real appealed to the Supreme Court [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner may avail of the writ of habeas corpus to recover custody of his daughter under Article 403 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition for being moot and academic.

Article 403 of the Civil Code provides that a daughter "above twenty-one but below twenty-three years of age" cannot leave the parental home without consent, except for specific reasons such as marriage or profession [4]. However, at the time of the decision in 1967, Lilian Real was already over 24 years old, placing her unquestionably beyond the coverage of Article 403 [4]. The writ of habeas corpus cannot be used by a father to recover custody of a 24-year-old daughter who voluntarily left the parental home and is not being detained or restrained of her liberty [5, 6].

Petition dismissed [7].
