**I. CAPTION**
THE CLOROX COMPANY v. THE DIRECTOR OF PATENTS and GO SIU GIAN, G.R. No. L-19531, August 10, 1967, Angeles, J.

**II. FACTS**
On April 7, 1959, respondent Go Siu Gian applied for the registration of the trademark "OLDROX." The application was published in the Official Gazette on August 22, 1960 [1]. On September 21, 1960, within the 30-day period prescribed by law, petitioner Clorox Company filed an unverified opposition [2]. Subsequently, on November 16, 1960, petitioner’s counsel filed the required verified notice of opposition. However, due to an error by counsel's employee, the verified opposition was submitted under a covering letter referencing a different case ("The Shell Company... vs. Faustino Co") also handled by the firm [2].

On January 6, 1961, the Director of Patents dismissed Clorox's opposition for failure to file the verified notice within the statutory period [2]. Clorox immediately filed a motion advising the Director of the misfiling and requested the document be transferred to the correct file. Before this was acted upon, Clorox filed a "petition for relief" alleging mistake and excusable negligence [2, 3]. The Director denied both the motion and petition, ruling strictly on technical grounds, and ordered the registration of "OLDROX." Clorox appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the verified opposition was validly filed on time despite being submitted under an erroneous covering letter.
2. W/N the Director of Patents abused his discretion in denying the motion and petition for relief based on technicalities.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court held that the verified opposition was filed on time [4]. Under Rule 187(c) of the Revised Rules of Practice in Trademark Cases, an unverified opposition is valid if verified by the opposer within 60 days of filing [4]. Clorox complied with this timeline. The fact that it was submitted under a wrong covering letter does not negate the filing, as a covering letter is not part of the pleading [4]. The pleading reached the proper official within the prescribed time. Furthermore, it is the duty of the clerk of court to examine pleadings before filing them; relying solely on a covering letter constitutes gross negligence by the clerk [4]. There was substantial compliance with the law [4].

2. **YES.** The Director of Patents abused his discretion [5]. The rules of procedure should be liberally construed to allow the real matter in dispute to be submitted to judgment [6]. While a petition for relief is technically filed *after* a judgment becomes final, the grounds (mistake, excusable negligence) are substantially similar to a motion for reconsideration or new trial [6]. Since Clorox filed the petition before the order became final, the Director should have treated it as a motion for reconsideration [6]. Denying relief on the "flimsy excuse" that the pleading was captioned as a petition for relief rather than a motion for reconsideration amounts to an abuse of discretion [5, 7].

**Disposition:** The order and resolution of the Director of Patents are **SET ASIDE**, and the case is **REMANDED** to the Patent Office for further proceedings [8].
