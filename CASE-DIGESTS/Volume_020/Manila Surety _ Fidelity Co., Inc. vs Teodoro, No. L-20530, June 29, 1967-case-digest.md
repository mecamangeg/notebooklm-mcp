I. CAPTION
MANILA SURETY & FIDELITY COMPANY, INC. v. TRINIDAD TEODORO and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-20530, June 29, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Manila Surety obtained a joint and several money judgment against Jose Corominas, Jr. in the CFI of Manila [1]. To satisfy the judgment, the sheriff levied upon properties found at the residence of Corominas and Respondent Trinidad Teodoro [2]. Teodoro claimed exclusive ownership of the properties, but the sheriff proceeded with the levy [2]. Teodoro filed an injunction suit in the CFI of Rizal, which was dismissed after the court declared the properties to be "community properties" of Teodoro and Corominas [3].

Teodoro appealed the dismissal. However, before the records could be elevated, Manila Surety obtained a "Third Alias Writ of Execution" from the CFI of Manila, causing the sheriff to schedule the properties for auction again [4]. Teodoro filed a petition for injunction with the Court of Appeals (CA), which granted the writ and enjoined the sale [5]. Petitioner argues that Corominas and Teodoro's relationship (governed by a void marriage due to Corominas's subsisting prior marriage) created a co-ownership under Article 144 of the Civil Code, making the properties answerable for Corominas's debts [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the subject properties are part of a co-ownership under Article 144 of the Civil Code liable for the judgment debtor's obligations.
2. W/N the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to issue the injunction.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's finding that the properties were not part of a co-ownership. Although Corominas’s Nevada divorce was invalid and his subsequent marriage to Teodoro was bigamous and void [6, 7], Article 144 of the Civil Code did not apply to these specific properties. The Court relied on the factual finding that the funds used by Teodoro to acquire the properties were "fruits of her paraphernal investments which accrued before her marriage to Corominas" [6, 8]. Consequently, the properties belonged exclusively to her and could not be levied upon to satisfy the separate debts of Corominas [8]. The Court deemed it unnecessary to rule on whether a valid subsisting marriage constitutes an impediment that precludes the application of Article 144 entirely, as the properties were proven to be Teodoro's separate estate [8].

2. **YES.** The injunction was properly issued in aid of the CA's appellate jurisdiction [9]. Teodoro had already perfected her appeal regarding the ownership of the properties when the trial court issued another writ of execution [9]. Since it was impracticable to wait for the appeal to be docketed, an independent petition for injunction was justified to prevent the sale of the properties pending the appeal [9].

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [10].
