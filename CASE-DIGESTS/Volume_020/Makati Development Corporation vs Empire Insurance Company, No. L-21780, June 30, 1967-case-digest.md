I. CAPTION
MAKATI DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION v. EMPIRE INSURANCE CO., G.R. No. L-21780, June 30, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On March 31, 1959, Makati Development Corporation (MDC) sold a lot in Urdaneta Village to Rodolfo Andal for P55,615 [1]. The deed of sale contained a "special condition" requiring Andal to commence and complete at least 50% of his residence within two years (by March 31, 1961), secured by a surety bond of P12,000 from Empire Insurance Co. [1, 2]. Andal failed to build and instead sold the lot to Juan Carlos. Neither Andal nor Carlos completed the construction within the stipulated period [3]. MDC filed a complaint against Empire Insurance to recover the full bond amount. The trial court found that while the house was not finished by the deadline, Carlos had completed more than 50% of the structure by the end of April 1961, just one month late [4]. Consequently, the trial court reduced Empire’s liability from P12,000 to P1,500. MDC appealed, arguing for full forfeiture and claiming Carlos's acts could not constitute performance for Andal due to lack of privity [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court validly reduced the penalty under the penal clause despite non-compliance within the stipulated period.
2. W/N the construction by the transferee (Juan Carlos) constitutes partial performance by the original vendee (Andal).

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The "special condition" in the deed is an obligation with a penal clause [5]. While a penalty generally substitutes for damages and interest under Art. 1226 of the Civil Code, Art. 1229 mandates that a judge shall equitably reduce the penalty when the principal obligation has been partly or irregularly complied with [6, 7]. The trial court found that Carlos had finished more than 50% of the house barely a month after the deadline [7]. This constitutes substantial, if tardy, performance. Since the purpose of the penalty was to compel performance (encourage home building) rather than mere indemnification, strict enforcement of the full penalty is unjustified [8, 9].

2. **YES.** The stipulation to build is not a strictly personal obligation of Andal. To construe it otherwise would restrict Andal's right to dispose of the lot, a limitation that requires explicit language in the contract [10]. The construction by the transferee serves the purpose of the contract and qualifies as partial performance, justifying the reduction of the penalty [9, 10].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [11].
