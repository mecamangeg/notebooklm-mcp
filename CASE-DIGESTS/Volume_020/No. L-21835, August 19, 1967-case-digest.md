I. CAPTION
THE CHIEF OF STAFF, ARMED FORCES OF THE PHILIPPINES v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, ET AL., MADRIGAL SHIPPING CO., INC., and CESARIO SIPACO, G.R. No. L-21835, August 19, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
The Khoong partners bought surplus war materials and hired Cesario Sipaco to possess and administer them in Tacloban [1]. They chartered Madrigal Shipping Co.'s vessel *SS Lepus* to transport the goods to Hong Kong [1]. The Visayan Workers' Union loaded the cargo in Tacloban [2]. While docked in Manila, the government seized the cargo, which was then unloaded and stored by the Philippine Port Terminal, Inc. [2, 3].

The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) used some of the confiscated cargo and agreed to pay ₱24,292.00 [2, 4]. As claims against the cargo exceeded this amount, the AFP Chief of Staff filed a complaint in interpleader with the CFI of Manila [4]. The remaining goods were sold, bringing the total deposited funds to ₱29,948.50 [4].

The CFI ruled that the New Civil Code applied, declaring the Bureau of Internal Revenue's (BIR) claim for sales tax as preferred to be satisfied first, with the claims of Madrigal Shipping, Philippine Port Terminal, and Visayan Workers' Union to be satisfied *pro rata* from the balance [5]. Madrigal Shipping and Sipaco (whose claim was not recognized as preferred) appealed, arguing the applicability of the Spanish Civil Code of 1889 [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Spanish Civil Code of 1889 applies to the preference of credits in this case.
2. W/N the claim of the Collector of Internal Revenue for sales taxes is a preferred credit.
3. W/N the claims for stevedoring wages (Visayan Workers), arrastre/storage (Phil. Port Terminal), and administration expenses (Sipaco) are preferred credits.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that since all claims against the goods matured and became demandable prior to the effectivity of the New Civil Code, the Spanish Civil Code of 1889 governs the preference of credits [6].

2. **YES.** Although Article 1922 of the Spanish Civil Code does not list taxes as preferred credits, Section 315 of the National Internal Revenue Code provides that every internal revenue tax constitutes a lien superior to all other charges or liens [7]. This lien attaches when the tax becomes due and continues until paid or the prescriptive period for assessment/collection lapses [8].

3. **YES.** Stevedoring wages and arrastre/storage fees are preferred under Paragraph 4, Article 1922 of the Spanish Civil Code, which covers credits for transportation and expenditures for the "carriage and preservation" of goods [3, 9]. Stevedoring is a necessary expenditure for carriage, while arrastre/storage is an expense for preservation [3]. Similarly, Sipaco's claim for administration expenses is preferred under Paragraph 1, Article 1922, as credits for the "preservation of personal property" because he was hired to keep and preserve the goods awaiting shipment [10].

**Judgment modified.** The claim of the Collector of Internal Revenue shall be satisfied first. The claims of Madrigal Shipping, Philippine Port Terminal, Visayan Workers' Union, and Cesario Sipaco shall be satisfied *pro rata* from the balance pursuant to Article 1926 of the Spanish Civil Code [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
