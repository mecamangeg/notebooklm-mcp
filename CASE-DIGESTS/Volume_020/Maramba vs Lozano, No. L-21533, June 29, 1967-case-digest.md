I. CAPTION
HERMOGENES MARAMBA v. NIEVES DE LOZANO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21533, June 29, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On November 3, 1948, petitioner Hermogenes Maramba filed an action for collection of money against spouses Nieves and Pascual Lozano. On June 23, 1959, the trial court rendered a decision sentencing the spouses to pay Maramba P3,500.07. This decision became final and executory after the Court of Appeals dismissed the defendants' appeal for failure to file a brief. A writ of execution was issued, levying a parcel of land covered by TCT No. 8192 in the name of Nieves de Lozano.

During the execution proceedings, Nieves paid P2,000.00 but alleged that her husband Pascual had died in 1952 during the pendency of the case. She argued that her liability should be only half of the judgment award and claimed the property levied was paraphernal. Despite this, the auction sale proceeded, and Maramba won the bid. Subsequently, on June 28, 1961, the trial court issued an order modifying the writ of execution, holding that Nieves' liability was merely joint (only P1,750.04). Maramba appealed, arguing that a *nunc pro tunc* order should have been issued to dismiss the case against the deceased husband and correct the 1959 decision to make Nieves solely liable for the whole amount.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the final decision of June 23, 1959 can be amended by a *nunc pro tunc* order to dismiss the case against the deceased defendant and correct the liability.
2. W/N the liability of the defendant spouses under the judgment is joint or solidary.
3. W/N the property titled in the wife's name is conjugal and answerable for the entire judgment debt.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A judgment that has become final and executory can no longer be amended or corrected by the court, except for clerical errors or mistakes. The amendment sought by Maramba involves the very substance of the controversy, not merely clerical errors. Furthermore, this cannot be accomplished by a *nunc pro tunc* order, the purpose of which is merely to make a present record of an order the court rendered previously but failed to record by inadvertence. Since no such order was previously made, there is nothing to record [1, 2].

2. **NO (It is joint).** The decision of June 23, 1959 did not specify the extent of liability of each defendant. The rule is that when the judgment does not order the defendants to pay jointly and severally, their liability is merely joint, and none of them may be compelled to satisfy the judgment in full [3].

3. **NO.** The presumption under Article 160 of the Civil Code that property is conjugal refers only to property acquired during the marriage. As there was no showing when the property was acquired, the fact that the title is in the wife's name alone indicates it belongs exclusively to her [3]. Furthermore, the construction of a house at conjugal expense on the exclusive property of a spouse does not automatically make the land conjugal under Article 158. Ownership of the land remains with the spouse until the value thereof is paid upon the liquidation of the partnership [4].

**Order affirmed.**
