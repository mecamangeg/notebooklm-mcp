**I. CAPTION**
FIREMEN'S INSURANCE COMPANY v. MANILA PORT SERVICE, MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, KLAVENESS LINE and/or SMITH, BELL & Co., (Phil.) INC., G.R. No. L-22810, August 31, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 24, 1962, a shipment of grouting materials and concrete hardener consigned to E.J. Nell Co. was shipped on board M/S 'Bougainville'. The vessel arrived in Manila and discharged the cargo on March 16, 1962, into the custody of the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service (MPS) [1], [2]. Upon delivery to the consignee, 13 pails were found damaged. MPS issued a "Bad Order" certificate indicating the damage occurred at the pier [2].

The consignee filed a provisional claim with MPS on March 19, 1962, and a formal claim on May 12, 1962 [3]. Firemen's Insurance Company, as subrogee of the consignee, paid the insurance claim and subsequently filed suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against the carrier (alternative defendant) and MPS (arrastre operator) for P854.14 [2], [4].

MPS argued that the CFI lacked jurisdiction because the amount was under P5,000 (cognizable by municipal courts) and that the claim was barred because the formal claim was filed beyond the 15-day period prescribed in the Management Contract [4], [5]. The CFI ruled in favor of the plaintiff, ordering MPS to pay damages. MPS appealed on pure questions of law [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over an arrastre claim involving an amount less than P5,000 when joined with an alternative admiralty action.
2. W/N the claim is barred by the 15-day notice requirement under the Management Contract.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** An action against an arrastre operator and, in the alternative, against a carrier for damages to imported goods calls for the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction regarding the carrier, which is within the original exclusive competence of the Court of First Instance. Since Section 5, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court permits the joinder of alternative causes of action, the CFI retains jurisdiction over both, even if the arrastre claim standing alone would fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of a municipal court [7], [8], [4]. The Court cited *Rizal Surety & Insurance Co. vs. Manila Railroad*, holding that jurisdiction is determined by the joinder of the admiralty suit [4].

2. **NO.** The defense of prescription fails on two grounds. First, the 15-day period to file a claim commences not from the date of discharge, but from the date the consignee learns of the loss or damage, or could have secured such information with reasonable diligence (*Yu Kimteng Construction Corp. vs. Manila Port Service*) [9]. MPS failed to prove when the consignee actually learned of the damage, and thus could not sustain the defense that the formal claim on May 12 was late [10]. Second, the provisional claim filed on March 19 (within 15 days of discharge) was sufficient because it gave the arrastre operator a reasonable opportunity to check the validity of the claim, evidenced by the fact that MPS actually issued a Bad Order certificate confirming the damage occurred at the pier [11].

Decision affirmed [12].
