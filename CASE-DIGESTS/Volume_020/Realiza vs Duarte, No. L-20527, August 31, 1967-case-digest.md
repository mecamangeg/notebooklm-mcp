The source provided only contains the caption and date for *Realiza v. Duarte* (G.R. No. L-20527) [1], but it lacks the actual text of the decision (facts, issues, and ruling) necessary to create a case digest.

Would you like me to search for the full text of this case so I can write the digest for you?
