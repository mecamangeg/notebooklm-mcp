I. CAPTION
HARRY S. STONEHILL, et al. v. HON. JOSE W. DIOKNO, et al., G.R. No. L-19550, June 19, 1967, 20 SCRA 383, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Upon application by respondents-prosecutors, judges issued 42 search warrants against petitioners Harry Stonehill, et al., and various corporations for alleged violations of Central Bank Laws, Tariff and Customs Laws, Internal Revenue Code, and the Revised Penal Code [1, 2]. The warrants authorized the seizure of books of accounts, financial records, and other documents "showing all business transactions" [2]. Petitioners filed an original action for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, and injunction, arguing the warrants were null and void for being general warrants and violative of the Constitution [3]. The Supreme Court issued a preliminary injunction, which was later partially lifted regarding documents seized from the corporations, but maintained for those seized from petitioners' residences [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioners have standing to assail the legality of the search and seizure of documents belonging to the corporations.
2. W/N the search warrants are valid.
3. W/N the seized documents are admissible in evidence against petitioners.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Petitioners have no cause of action to assail the legality of the seizures from the corporations. A corporation has a personality separate and distinct from that of its officers [5, 6]. The legality of a seizure can be contested only by the party whose rights have been impaired thereby, and the objection to an unlawful search is purely personal [6]. Thus, the right to object belongs exclusively to the corporations [6].

2. **NO.** The search warrants are null and void. The Constitution requires that warrants be issued only upon probable cause and must particularly describe the things to be seized [7]. The warrants here failed these requirements: (1) No specific offense was alleged, making it impossible for judges to determine probable cause [8, 9]; and (2) The description of effects ("books of accounts... showing all business transactions") was too broad, authorizing a "fishing expedition" and constituting general warrants, which are outlawed [10-12].

3. **NO.** The Court abandoned the doctrine in *Moncado v. People's Court* and adopted the Exclusionary Rule [13, 14]. Evidence obtained in violation of the constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures is inadmissible [15]. The exclusion of such evidence is the only practical means of enforcing the constitutional injunction against unreasonable searches [16].

**Disposition:** The petition is DISMISSED regarding documents seized from the corporations. The petition is GRANTED regarding documents seized from petitioners' residences; the warrants for these are declared NULL and VOID, and the temporary injunction against their use is made PERMANENT [14].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Castro, J., concurring and dissenting:**
Concurred that the warrants were general and void, and that *Moncado* should be abandoned. However, he dissented regarding standing, arguing that petitioners had standing to suppress even corporate papers because the warrants were primarily directed against them personally, and legal standing should not determine the intrinsic nullity of a constitutional violation [17, 18]
