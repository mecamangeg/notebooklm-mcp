I. CAPTION
LITTON & CO., INC. v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-22516, August 17, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Litton & Co., Inc. applied to import 18 bales of "cotton textile woven with dyed yarn." Upon arrival in August 1956, the Bureau of Customs found the shipment contained "handkerchief cloth without unwoven spaces," a different commodity category. The goods were seized for violation of Central Bank Circular 44 but were released under a bond posted by Central Surety and Insurance Co. The bond amount was based on the appraised local market value of the goods. The Collector of Customs ordered the forfeiture of the bond under Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code (RAC). The Commissioner of Customs and the Court of Tax Appeals affirmed the forfeiture. Litton appealed, arguing that the repeal of Circular 44 abated the liability and challenging the method of appraisal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the repeal of Central Bank Circular 44 by Circular 133 abated the forfeiture liability.
2. W/N the appraised value of the seized merchandise was correctly based on the local market value.
3. W/N Section 34 of Republic Act No. 265 (criminal liability) excludes the application of forfeiture proceedings under the Revised Administrative Code.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Central Bank Circular 133 did not repeal Circular 44 regarding the requirement of a release certificate [1]. Even assuming a repeal took place, it would not have the effect of legalizing an importation that was made illegally prior to said repeal [1].

2. **YES.** The valuation was correctly based on Section 1377 of the Revised Administrative Code, which governs seizure proceedings and bases appraisal on the local market value of the merchandise [1, 2]. The Petitioner's reliance on Rule 13(a), Section 2 of the Philippine Tariff Act of 1909 is misplaced, as that provision refers to the value in the country of origin for the purpose of determining customs duties, not for seizure proceedings [2].

3. **NO.** The application of Section 34 of Republic Act No. 265 extends to the criminal liability of persons violating Monetary Board regulations [3]. This liability exists *in addition* to, and not to the exclusion of, the seizure and forfeiture proceedings against the imported merchandise under the Revised Administrative Code [3].

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
