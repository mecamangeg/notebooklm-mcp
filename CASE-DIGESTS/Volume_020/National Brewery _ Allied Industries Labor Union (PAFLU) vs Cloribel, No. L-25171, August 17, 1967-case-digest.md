I. CAPTION
NATIONAL BREWERY & ALLIED INDUSTRIES LABOR UNION (PAFLU) v. HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL, SAN MIGUEL CORPORATION and THE PHILIPPINE BANKING CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-25171, August 17, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner PAFLU had a collective bargaining agreement with San Miguel Corporation (SMC) which included the deduction of union dues to be remitted to the union treasurer. An intra-union dispute arose when a rival faction led by Charles Mitscheck claimed to have been elected officers on February 19, 1964, challenging the incumbent faction of Antonio Santos elected in November 1963. Mitscheck notified SMC and the banks holding union funds to deal only with his faction [1]. Consequently, the banks refused to honor checks drawn by the Santos faction, paralyzing union affairs [2].

PAFLU (Santos faction) filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila (Civil Case No. 56563) [1]. On April 25, 1964, respondent Judge Cloribel issued an order acknowledging that the subject matter involved Unfair Labor Practices under Republic Act No. 875 and was already pending before the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) in Case No. 4128 [3]. The Judge ordered the CFI case held in abeyance but directed that the union dues in the hands of SMC be deposited with the CFI [3]. PAFLU filed this petition for certiorari, arguing the Judge acted in excess of jurisdiction [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to order the deposit of union dues when the main controversy involves internal union disputes pending before the Court of Industrial Relations.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the respondent Judge acted without or in excess of jurisdiction.

The Court reasoned that while the CFI generally has jurisdiction over the enforcement of contractual obligations under a collective bargaining agreement, the fundamental issue in this case was "which of the two sets of officers... have the authority to demand compliance" [5]. This issue constitutes "internal labor organization procedures" which fall within the exclusive cognizance of the CIR pursuant to Section 17 of Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act) [6]. The Court emphasized that the CIR is better positioned and qualified than ordinary courts to determine cases involving rights and conditions of union membership and problems of management and labor [7].

Since the respondent Judge himself admitted that the question involved was the same as that in the pending ULP case before the CIR, he could not validly order the deposit of the money with the CFI [8].

**Disposition:** The order of April 25, 1964 is set aside [9].
