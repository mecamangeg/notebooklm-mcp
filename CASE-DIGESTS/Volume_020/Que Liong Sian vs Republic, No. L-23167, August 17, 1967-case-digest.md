I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE CHANGE OF NAME OF LEE LIONG SIAN alias GEORGE QUE LIONG SIAN. GEORGE QUE LIONG SIAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-23167, August 17, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lee Liong Sian, a naturalized Filipino citizen since 1961, filed a petition to change his name to "George Lee Neri" to fully integrate into Filipino society [1]. He argued that his Chinese name was a roadblock to being treated as a Filipino, hampered his social and business dealings, was difficult to spell, and he wished to prevent discrimination against his future children [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental granted the petition on May 11, 1964 [3]. The Republic appealed on questions of law, but the Solicitor General subsequently filed a motion to withdraw the appeal, stating the intended objections were "too technical" and a waste of time [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's desire to adopt a Filipino name to erase signs of his former alien nationality constitutes a proper and reasonable cause for a change of name.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that while a change of name is a privilege and not a right, a sincere desire by a naturalized citizen to adopt a Filipino name is a proper and reasonable cause [5]. This applies when the purpose is to erase signs of a former alien nationality that unduly hamper social and business life, provided there is no prejudice to the State or any individual [5]. Relying on the doctrine in *Uy v. Republic* (L-22712), and finding no fraudulent motive, the Court allowed the withdrawal.

Appeal withdrawn and/or dismissed [6].
