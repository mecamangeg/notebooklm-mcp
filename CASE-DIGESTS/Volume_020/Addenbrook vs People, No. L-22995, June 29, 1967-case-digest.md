I. CAPTION
WILLIAM ADDENBROOK Y BARKER v. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22995, June 29, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On January 9, 1960, petitioner William Addenbrook was driving a Stanvac service truck along Marquez de Comillas, Manila, when he struck Wenceslao Risaldo, a pedestrian [1]. Risaldo died from the injuries [1]. Patrolman Guzman, who investigated the scene, testified that he found two sets of bloodstains separated by a distance of 15 paces, indicating the victim rolled that far upon impact [2]. Based on this, the lower courts concluded the truck was moving at an unreasonable speed [2]. Addenbrook claimed his view was blocked by a parked car and that the victim suddenly darted into his path [2]. The Court of First Instance convicted him of homicide through reckless imprudence, which the Court of Appeals affirmed [3]. Addenbrook appealed, questioning the patrolman's competency to testify and arguing he shouldn't be liable due to the sudden emergency [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the patrolman was competent to testify on the accident details despite not seeing the collision.
2. W/N the petitioner is criminally liable despite the victim allegedly darting out from behind a parked car.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A patrolman who conducts an ocular inspection is competent to testify on what he found during such investigation [4]. His testimony regarding the bloodstains and the 15-pace distance was admissible because these were facts derived from his own perception [4].

2. **YES.** The Court held that the sudden entry of a pedestrian into the path of a vehicle does not excuse the driver if the vehicle was being driven at an unreasonable rate of speed [6]. The evidence of the victim rolling 15 paces proved excessive speed, and the petitioner admitted he failed to blow his horn despite a visual obstruction [2]. The doctrine that a driver is not accountable for failing to take the wisest choice in a sudden emergency does not apply here because the emergency was of the driver's own creation due to his speeding [6].

Decision affirmed [7].
