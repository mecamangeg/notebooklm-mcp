I. CAPTION
EMILIA SOMODIO v. COMMISSIONER RUFO S. SUCALDITO and COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, 8th Regional District, G.R. No. L-20262, May 11, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Emilia Somodio owned a tract of land in Zarraga, Iloilo. On June 8, 1962, Isidro Sotelo filed a complaint with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR), claiming to be Somodio's tenant since 1952 and alleging that she threatened to eject him and plowed a portion of the land. Sotelo prayed for a preliminary injunction. Somodio countered that Sotelo was her tenant only from 1959 to 1961 and had voluntarily returned the land.

Pending the case, Sotelo moved for a preliminary injunction. Respondent Commissioner Sucaldito ordered an ocular inspection, which revealed that Sotelo was in actual physical possession of the land. Consequently, the Commissioner issued an order on July 23, 1962, directing Somodio to desist from disturbing or harassing Sotelo and to maintain him in peaceful possession. Somodio’s motion for reconsideration was denied. She then filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, challenging the Commissioner's order and arguing it was issued without a bond.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the interlocutory order of the CAR Commissioner is appealable to the Supreme Court.
2. W/N the Commissioner abused his discretion in issuing the restraining order without a bond.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petition purports to be an appeal under Section 13 of Republic Act No. 1267, which allows appeals to the Supreme Court only from **final** orders or decisions of the CAR. The order complained of is interlocutory as it merely directs the maintenance of the status quo pending final determination. The proper remedy for the petitioner was to appeal the Commissioner's order to the Associate Judge of the CAR, which she failed to do.

2. **NO.** There was no abuse of discretion because the Commissioner verified through an ocular inspection that Sotelo was in actual possession of the land before issuing the order. Furthermore, Section 3 of Rule 11 of the CAR Rules explicitly authorizes Commissioners to issue interlocutory orders in ejectment cases to prevent the ejectment of tenants **without requiring a bond**. This exemption exists because tenants generally possess no property to serve as security.

The petition is **DISMISSED**.
