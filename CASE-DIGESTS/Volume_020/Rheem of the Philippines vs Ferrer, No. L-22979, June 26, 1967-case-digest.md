I. CAPTION
RHEEM OF THE PHILIPPINES, INC., ET AL. v. ZOILO R. FERRER, ET AL. (IN RE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ALFONSO PONCE ENRILE, ET AL.), G.R. No. L-22979, June 26, 1967, 20 SCRA 89, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Counsel for petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the Supreme Court's decision on the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). The Motion stated that the Court had "repeatedly fallen" into a "pitfall" by relying on its own pronouncements "in disregard" of statutes, and charged the Court with "blindly adher[ing]" to earlier rulings without analysis, thus perpetuating error [1]. It further sarcastically referred to the "so-called 'rule against splitting of jurisdiction'" [2]. Consequently, the Court ordered the lawyers to show cause why they should not be cited for contempt [3]. In their return, the respondents apologized, attributing the language to the "overenthusiasm" of Atty. Armonio, who prepared the motion without clearing it with the senior partners [3], [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the language employed by the respondents in their Motion for Reconsideration constitutes contempt of court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The language used implies that the Court is "patently inept" and refuses to hew to the line drawn by law, which detracts from the dignity and respect due to the Court [5], [6]. Under Section 20(b), Rule 138 of the Rules of Court and the Canons of Legal Ethics, it is the duty of a lawyer to maintain respect for the courts and judicial officers [6]. While a lawyer may be enthusiastic or frustrated, such feelings must be circumscribed within the bounds of propriety; language that promotes distrust in judicial administration is proscribed [7], [8]. "Want of intention" to offend is no excuse for disrespectful language, though it may extenuate liability [9]. Furthermore, partners in a law firm are duty-bound to provide efficacious control of court pleadings that carry their names [9].

Atty. Jose S. Armonio is **ADMONISHED** with a warning that a repetition of the incident will be dealt with accordingly. The attention of Attys. Ponce Enrile, Siguion Reyna, Montecillo, Belo, and Ongsiako is invited to the necessity of exercising adequate supervision over their firm's pleadings [10].
