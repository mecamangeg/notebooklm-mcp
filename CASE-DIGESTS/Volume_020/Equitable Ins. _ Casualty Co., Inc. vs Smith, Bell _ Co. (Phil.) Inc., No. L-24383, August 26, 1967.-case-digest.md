I. CAPTION
EQUITABLE INSURANCE & CASUALTY CO., INC. v. SMITH, BELL & CO., (PHILIPPINES) INC. and/or THE BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-24383, August 26, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Manila Auto Supply Co., Inc. imported merchandise which arrived in Manila on June 18, 1963, on board the vessel s/s "Bonneville." The plaintiff, Equitable Insurance & Casualty Co., Inc., as the consignee's subrogee, sought to recover P23,420.84 representing the value of undelivered merchandise [1]. Uncertain whether the loss occurred while in the custody of the vessel or the arrastre operator, the plaintiff filed a suit in the Court of First Instance of Manila against Smith, Bell & Co. (the carrier's agent) and the Bureau of Customs (the arrastre operator) in the alternative [1].

The Bureau of Customs moved to dismiss the case on the ground of non-suability. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the case against the Bureau of Customs. After its motion for reconsideration was denied, the plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Bureau of Customs may be sued for money claims arising from its operation of the arrastre service.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Bureau of Customs cannot be a party defendant in a suit because it is neither a natural nor a juridical person, nor an entity authorized by law to be sued [2, 3]. It is merely an arm of the Department of Finance and has no legal personality apart from the national government [2, 3].

While the arrastre service is a proprietary function, it is a necessary incident to the Bureau’s primary governmental function of assessing and collecting lawful revenues from imported articles [2, 3]. Consequently, the suit is essentially a claim for money against the State, which has not consented to be sued [2, 4, 5]. Statutory provisions waiving State immunity must be construed *strictissimi juris* because waiver is in derogation of sovereignty [4-6]. The proper remedy for such claims is to lodge them with the Auditor General pursuant to Commonwealth Act No. 327 [4-6].

The order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED** [7].
