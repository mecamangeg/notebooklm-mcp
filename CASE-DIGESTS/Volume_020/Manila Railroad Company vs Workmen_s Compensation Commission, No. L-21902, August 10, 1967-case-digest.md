I. CAPTION
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. THE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and RICARDO BALMEO, G.R. No. L-21902, August 10, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Ricardo Balmeo was employed by the Manila Railroad Company as a trackman, a job involving strenuous labor and exposure to the elements [1]. On January 11, 1961, he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis but continued working until June 16, 1961, when the company dismissed him due to his illness [1]. Balmeo filed a claim for disability compensation on October 10, 1961, nearly four months after his dismissal [2]. The company filed its employer's report and manifestation to controvert the claim only on November 10, 1961 [2]. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded compensation to Balmeo, ruling that his illness was work-aggravated and that the company failed to controvert the claim on time [3]. The company appealed, arguing that the WCC lacked jurisdiction because Balmeo failed to give notice of sickness and file his claim within the two-month period prescribed by Section 24 of Act 3428 (Workmen's Compensation Act) [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the WCC acquired jurisdiction over the claim despite the employee's failure to file notice and claim within the period prescribed by Section 24 of Act 3428.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the WCC's decision [5]. The Court held that the failure of an employee to comply with the notice and claim requirements of Section 24 of Act 3428 is non-jurisdictional [6]. Furthermore, delay in giving notice does not bar a claim if the employer had knowledge of the sickness or did not suffer by such delay [6].

Under Section 45 of Act 3428, an employer must manifest its intention to controvert a claim within 14 days of the disability or within 10 days of acquiring knowledge of the accident [6]. In this case, the company dismissed Balmeo on June 16, 1961, due to his tuberculosis, yet only filed its controversion on November 10, 1961 [7]. By failing to controvert within the statutory period, the company renounced its right to contest the compensability of the claim, and it cannot subsequently challenge the claim based on the employee's delay in filing [7, 8].

The petition was dismissed, and the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission was affirmed [5].
