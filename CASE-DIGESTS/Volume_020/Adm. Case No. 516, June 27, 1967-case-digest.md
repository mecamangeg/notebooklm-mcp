I. CAPTION
TRANQUILINO O. CALO, JR. v. ESTEBAN DEGAMO, Adm. Case No. 516, June 27, 1967, 20 SCRA 447, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On January 17, 1959, respondent Esteban Degamo applied for the position of Chief of Police of Carmen, Agusan. He subscribed and swore to an Information Sheet which asked for his "Criminal or police record, if any, including those which did not reach the Court." Degamo answered "None" [1, 2]. However, at that time, a criminal case for illegal possession of explosive powder was pending against him in the Court of First Instance of Bohol [1, 2]. He was appointed to the position based on this application.

Complainant Tranquilino O. Calo, Jr. filed a disbarment complaint on March 2, 1962, charging Degamo with perjury/false statement [3]. The Solicitor General investigated and recommended disbarment for gross misconduct [4]. Degamo claimed good faith, arguing he interpreted the question to refer only to final judgments or convictions, and raised defenses of prescription and that the form was not required by law [5-7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N respondent should be disbarred for gross misconduct due to his false statement in the application.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that respondent's defense of good faith is untenable. The question in the Information Sheet was simple and expressly included cases "which did not reach the Court," completely disproving his claim that it referred only to final judgments [1, 6].

By deliberately concealing the truth to secure an appointment, respondent failed to maintain the high degree of morality required of a member of the Bar and violated his oath to "do no falsehood" [7-9]. The Court further held that: (1) ordinary statutes of limitation do not apply to disbarment proceedings; (2) the pendency of a perjury case is not a prejudicial question as disbarment is based on gross misconduct, not conviction of a crime; and (3) the fact that the form was not required by law is irrelevant to the issue of his honesty [7, 10-12].

Respondent Esteban Degamo is **DISBARRED** and his name ordered stricken from the roll of attorneys [13].
