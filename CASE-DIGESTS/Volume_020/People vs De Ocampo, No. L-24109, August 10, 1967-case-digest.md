I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROGELIA DE OCAMPO Y PADILLA, No. L-24109, August 10, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On September 15, 1964, Rogelia de Ocampo was apprehended by a Philippine Constabulary patrol aboard a boat in Marinduque bound for Lucena [1]. A search of her belongings revealed three bags containing silver and nickel coins totaling P1,120.00 in various denominations [1, 2]. She was charged with violation of Republic Act No. 427, which penalizes the possession of such coins in excess of P50.00 [1]. In her affidavit, De Ocampo admitted she was engaged in buying and selling coins for a percentage, intending to sell them to a contact who would use them for purchases in Hong Kong [3]. The Court of First Instance of Marinduque convicted her, sentencing her to one year imprisonment and a P5,000.00 fine [2]. On appeal, De Ocampo argued that under R.A. No. 427, "persons conducting business" are given seven days to turn over excess coins to a bank or treasury, and since her possession was not shown to exceed seven days, she should not be liable [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appellant's possession of P1,120.00 in coins constituted a violation of R.A. No. 427 despite her claim of being a "person conducting business."

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court held that the appellant does not fall under the category of "persons conducting business" who are granted a period to turn over excess coins [3]. That provision refers to businesses where the possession of coins is merely *incidental* to operations [3]. In this case, the appellant was not engaged in a regular business generating coins; rather, her specific "business" was the buying and selling of the coins themselves for profit [3]. This practice constitutes the very evil R.A. No. 427 intends to curb, as it results in the systematic withdrawal of coins from circulation, causing adverse effects on the national economy [5].

Judgment affirmed [6].
