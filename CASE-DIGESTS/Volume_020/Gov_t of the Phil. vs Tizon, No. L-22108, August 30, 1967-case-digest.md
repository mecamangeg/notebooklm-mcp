I. CAPTION
GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, represented by the BUREAU OF SUPPLY COORDINATION v. MARCELINO TIZON, ET AL., and CAPITAL INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-22108, August 30, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Marcelino Tizon (Tizon Engineering) won a bid to supply equipment to the Bureau of Supply Coordination. To guarantee faithful performance, Capital Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. (Surety) issued a bond in favor of the Republic [1]. Tizon failed to deliver, forcing the Government to purchase from another supplier at a loss of P2,975. The Government sued Tizon and the Surety in the City Court of Manila for recovery of the sum [1].

The City Court rendered judgment ordering Tizon and the Surety to pay the amount *jointly and severally* [2]. Only Tizon appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The Surety did not appeal [2]. Consequently, the Government moved to execute the judgment against the Surety, arguing that the decision had become final as to it [3]. The CFI granted the motion, expunged the Surety’s answer, and ordered execution [4, 5]. The Surety appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that Tizon's appeal should inure to its benefit due to the dependent nature of their obligation [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal by the principal debtor (Tizon) inures to the benefit of the non-appealing solidary surety, thereby preventing the execution of the judgment against the surety.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the order of execution. While the general rule is that a reversal on appeal does not benefit non-appealing parties, an exception exists when the rights and liabilities of the appealing and non-appealing parties are "so interwoven and dependent as to be inseparable," in which case a reversal as to one operates as a reversal as to all [6].

The Court relied on *Municipality of Orion vs. Concha*, holding that the liability of a surety is consequent upon the liability of the principal [7, 8]. Although the bond was "joint and several," the Surety does not incur liability unless the principal debtor is held liable [8]. Under Article 1222 of the Civil Code, a solidary debtor may avail of defenses derived from the nature of the obligation [9]. Since Tizon asserted on appeal that he had no liability, and if this were proven, the judgment could not stand against the Surety [10, 11]. Therefore, it was premature to execute the judgment against the Surety while the principal's liability was still being contested on appeal [11].

The orders appealed from are set aside [12].
