**I. CAPTION**
CAMPUA UY TINA v. THE HON. DAVID P. AVILA, in his capacity as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Cotabato, First Branch; TAN CHING JI, and THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF COTABATO, G.R. No. L-20900, May 16, 1967, 20 SCRA 1109, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 4, 1954, the Court of First Instance of Cotabato approved a compromise agreement in Civil Case No. 536 between plaintiff Tan Ching Ji and defendant Campua Uy Tina [1]. Under the agreement, Uy Tina bound himself to pay Tan Ching Ji P23,000.00 "within a period of six (6) years" from the date of the decision [1]. On September 20, 1960, after the six-year period expired, Tan Ching Ji filed a motion for execution, which the court granted on August 14, 1962 [2]. Uy Tina filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that under Rule 39, Section 6, a judgment may only be executed by motion within five years from the date of its entry [3]. He contended that since more than five years had elapsed from the 1954 decision to the 1960 motion, the judgment could no longer be enforced by mere motion but required an independent action [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the judgment based on a compromise with a six-year term of payment can be executed by motion filed after the lapse of said term, despite being more than five years from the date of entry.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that the execution by motion was proper and not time-barred.

Execution contemplates a situation where a judgment is susceptible of enforcement the moment it acquires finality [4]. In this case, the obligation was one with a term of six years, which was indubitably for the benefit of the petitioner [5]. Under Article 1193 of the Civil Code, an obligation with a term is demandable only when the term expires [5]. Had the respondent demanded payment or moved for execution before the six-year lapse, it would have been futile as the obligation was not yet due [5]. Consequently, the writ of execution could only have been effectively issued after the lapse of six years from February 4, 1954 [6]. The five-year period for execution by motion under Rule 39, Section 6 does not apply where the judgment itself suspends execution for a period exceeding five years.

The petition was denied with double costs imposed against the petitioner for filing a patently frivolous action [6, 7].
