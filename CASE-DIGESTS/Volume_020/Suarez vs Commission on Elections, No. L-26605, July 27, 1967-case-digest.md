**I. CAPTION**
**PABLO D. SUAREZ, GUILLERMO C. LUCAS and GERARDO I. BAUTISTA v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, EDILBERTO REGALADO, ENRIQUE ROA, and NESTORIO BAUTISTA**, G.R. No. L-26605, July 27, 1967, Castro, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners Suarez, Lucas, and Bautista held appointments dated February 1, 1964, as "Election Registrars" without designation of specific stations, but were detailed to the City of Manila by verbal assignment. On March 29, 1966, respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC) resolved to appoint petitioners as permanent election registrars for the first, second, and fourth congressional districts of Manila. However, before the appointment papers could be issued, another registrar, Ernesto Verdejo, petitioned for his retention in Manila. This prompted COMELEC to restudy the service records of all registrars detailed in the city.

On August 24, 1966, acting on the recommendation of a screening committee, COMELEC resolved to permanently appoint respondents Roa, Regalado, and Bautista to the Manila posts instead of the petitioners. These appointments were approved by the Civil Service Commission. Petitioners refused to vacate their posts, claiming their original 1964 appointments and the March 1966 resolution gave them security of tenure. They filed a petition for prohibition, mandamus, and *quo warranto*.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N petitioners’ original 1964 appointments entitled them to security of tenure in Manila.
2. W/N the COMELEC resolution of March 29, 1966 constituted a completed appointment vesting title to the office in petitioners.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court reiterated the ruling in *Ibañez v. Commission on Elections* that appointments which do not specify a particular station, followed by assignment to a place by mere detail, do not entitle the appointees to security of tenure in the places to which they are assigned. Security of tenure applies only to the appointment itself, not to the assignment. Since petitioners' original appointments were generally as registrars without a specific station, they cannot assert security of tenure regarding their assignment to Manila [1-3].

2. **NO.** An appointment is not final or complete until the Commissioner of Civil Service has certified that such appointment may be made (*Grospe v. Secretary of Public Works*; *Favis v. Rupisan*). Without such certification, the appointment may be recalled or withdrawn by the appointing officer. In this case, the March 29, 1966 resolution was merely an act of the COMELEC to appoint; no appointment papers were issued, and no Civil Service certification was obtained. Thus, COMELEC retained the power to revise its decision and appoint the respondents instead [4-7].

**Petition dismissed.**

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Angeles, and Fernando concurred. Chief Justice Concepcion and Justice Dizon did not take part.
