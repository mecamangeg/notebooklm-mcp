I. CAPTION
EMILIANO ACUÑA v. HON. NICASIO YATCO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch V, Quezon City; BENITO MACROHON, Provincial Sheriff of Rizal & Quezon City; THE PHILIPPINE TOBACCO FLUE-CURING & REDRYING CORPORATION, THE BATAC PRODUCERS COOPERATIVE MARKETING ASSOCIATION, INC., JUSTINIANO GALANO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20560, July 31, 1967, 20 SCRA 867, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Emiliano Acuña filed a complaint (Civil Case No. Q-6547) against respondent Batac Producers Cooperative Marketing Association, Inc. (Batac Procoma) for the recovery of sums of money totaling over P350,000. Acuña obtained a writ of preliminary attachment, and the Sheriff garnished funds and checks belonging to Batac Procoma in the possession of the Philippine Tobacco Flue-Curing and Redrying Corporation (PTFCRCo).

On September 10, 1962, the trial court (presided by Judge Yatco) dismissed the complaint for lack of cause of action and ordered the discharge of the writ of preliminary attachment. Acuña appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-20333). On September 22, 1962, the trial court approved the record on appeal. Subsequently, on November 24, 1962, upon motion by the defendants, Judge Yatco issued an order directing PTFCRCo to deliver the garnished items to the Sheriff for release to the defendants, implementing the earlier discharge of the attachment. Acuña filed the present petition for certiorari, arguing that the trial court lost jurisdiction to issue the November 24 order after the record on appeal had been approved.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court had jurisdiction to order the release of attached properties after the approval of the record on appeal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition. The Court ruled that the legal effect of the discharge of the writ of preliminary attachment (via the September 10 order) was the extinguishment of the lien on the attached properties, rendering them free of encumbrance.

The subsequent order of November 24, 1962, directing the release of the properties, was not disparate from the earlier order of discharge. It was merely "a part, a continuation, and an implementation" of the September 10 order. The Court held that the order was practically a ministerial *auto* intended to carry out a pre-existing order issued within the court's jurisdiction. Trial courts retain jurisdiction to issue orders of this nature to execute or implement orders made prior to the perfection of the appeal (*National City Bank of New York v. Tiaoqui*; *Naredo v. Yatco*). Consequently, the trial court did not act in excess of jurisdiction.

The petition is **DISMISSED**.
