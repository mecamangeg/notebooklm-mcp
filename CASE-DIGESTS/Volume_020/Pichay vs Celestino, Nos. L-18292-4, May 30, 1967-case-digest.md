I. CAPTION
CRESENTE PICHAY, ET AL. v. ISAIAS CELESTINO, ET AL. and THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK (Dagupan Branch), G.R. Nos. L-18292-4, May 30, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs (Cresente Pichay, et al., Agdoma, et al., and Papa, et al.) were the registered owners of various parcels of land in Pangasinan [1-3]. Defendant Isaias Celestino, a lawyer and notary public, forged Special Powers of Attorney and Deeds of Sale to either authorize himself to mortgage the lands or transfer the titles to his name [1, 2, 4]. Using these forged documents and subsequently issued titles, Celestino obtained loans from the Philippine National Bank (PNB) secured by real estate mortgages on the properties [1, 2, 4]. The plaintiffs discovered the fraud and filed civil actions to annul the documents and mortgages [1, 5].

The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring the mortgages null and void (except for portions owned by Celestino) and cancelling the titles issued to Celestino [6-8]. The trial court found that PNB did not exercise due diligence, noting the "undue haste" in approving the loans—in one instance, the mortgage and the new title bore the same date [9]. PNB appealed, arguing it was a mortgagee in good faith and for value, entitled to rely on the face of the Torrens titles [10, 11].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N PNB is a mortgagee in good faith whose rights over the properties are protected under the Torrens system.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that PNB cannot be considered a mortgagee in good faith [12].

The Court found that PNB acted with "undue haste" in granting the loans and failed to ascertain the true ownership of the lands or the authority of the supposed agent [13]. Evidence showed that the mortgages were executed either on the same day or shortly after the issuance of the questionable titles or powers of attorney [9, 14, 15]. The Court noted that it is standard practice for banks to investigate the land offered as collateral and verify ownership, which PNB failed to do [13].

While a party dealing with registered land is generally not required to go beyond the face of the certificate of title, this rule does not apply when the purchaser or mortgagee is negligent [16]. The doctrine that "as between two innocent persons... the one who made it possible by his act of confidence must bear the loss" is inapplicable because PNB was not "innocent" due to its negligence, whereas the plaintiffs were not negligent and had no hand in the fraud [17]. Thus, PNB must suffer the loss [16].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
