**I. CAPTION**
**INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and BUREAU OF CUSTOMS**, G.R. No. L-26532, July 10, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiff Insurance Company of North America, acting as subrogee for the consignee Yu Brothers Trading Company, filed a suit against the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs to recover P1,543.58. This amount represented the value of lost bundles of axle shafts discharged from the vessel MV "Japan" into the custody of the Bureau of Customs, which was then operating the arrastre service [1].

The City Court of Manila initially granted recovery to the plaintiff. However, upon appeal to the Court of First Instance of Manila, the court dismissed the case. The lower court reasoned that the Bureau of Customs is an agency of the national government, and thus the suit was effectively against the Republic, which is immune from suit without its consent [1, 2]. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs are immune from suit regarding their operation of the arrastre service.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. The Court ruled that the Bureau of Customs, acting as part of the machinery of the national government in the operation of the arrastre service, does so as a necessary incident of its prime governmental function [3]. Therefore, it is immune from suit and cannot be held liable for the loss of merchandise entrusted to its custody [3, 4].

The Court relied on the doctrine established in *Mobil Philippines Exploration v. Customs Arrastre Service & Bureau of Customs* (G.R. No. L-23139, December 17, 1966) [3].

**Judgment affirmed.**
