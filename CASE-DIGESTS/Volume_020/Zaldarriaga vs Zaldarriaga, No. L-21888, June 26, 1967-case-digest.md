I. CAPTION
BASILIA F. VDA. DE ZALDARRIAGA v. PEDRO ZALDARRIAGA (substituted by CONSUELO T. VDA. DE ZALDARRIAGA), G.R. No. L-21888, June 26, 1967, 20 SCRA 432, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
The parties are co-owners of a parcel of land with an assessed value of P137,800.00 [1]. The plaintiff-appellee, representing the estate of Jose Zaldarriaga, owns an undivided 1/8 share, while the defendants-appellants, representing the estate of Pedro Zaldarriaga, own the remaining 7/8 shares and have been in possession of the land [1]. Plaintiff demanded her specific share and an accounting of produce, rentals, and profits totaling P202,302.00 [2].

The Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros upheld the plaintiff's right to 1/8 of the hacienda and awarded her a share of the produce, back rentals, and profits amounting to P139,586.00 [2, 3]. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court, raising twenty-two errors, which included questions of fact and mixed questions of fact and law [4]. The plaintiff did not appeal the decision [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court found that it lacked jurisdiction because the amount in controversy did not exceed the statutory threshold. Under Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1948 (R.A. 296), as amended, the Supreme Court has exclusive appellate jurisdiction in civil cases where the value in controversy exceeds P200,000.00 [6].

Although the original complaint sought P202,302.00, the trial court only awarded P139,586.00. Since the plaintiff did not appeal, this amount constitutes the value in controversy for the appeal [4, 5]. The value of the 1/8 portion of the land in dispute is P17,300.00 (1/8 of P137,800.00) [5]. Adding the land value to the monetary award results in a total of P156,886.00, which is below the P200,000.00 jurisdictional limit [5]. Furthermore, the appeal involved questions of fact, which generally fall outside the Supreme Court's jurisdiction [4].

Wherefore, the appeal is hereby certified to the Court of Appeals [7].
