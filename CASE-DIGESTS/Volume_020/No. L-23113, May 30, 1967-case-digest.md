**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SIXTO COMIGJOD, G.R. No. L-23113, May 30, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
On July 28, 1960, the body of Pastor Ladesa was found in a coffee grove in Sta. Cruz, Davao, bearing incise wounds on the head indicating he was killed at approximately 2:00 P.M. that day [1]. The following morning, the appellant's wife, Juliana, informed the barrio vice-lieutenant that her husband, Sixto Comigjod, was the killer [2]. When police confronted Comigjod with this information, he admitted to the crime, surrendered a blood-stained bolo, and later signed a sworn confession stating he killed Ladesa for being "too harsh at him" [2, 3].

The Court of First Instance of Davao convicted Comigjod of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment [1]. On appeal, Comigjod claimed alibi, alleging he was with his wife at the vice-lieutenant's house during the time of the murder, and that his confession was coerced [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the appellant's alibi and claim of coercion should be given credence.
2. W/N the killing was attended by treachery.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that the appellant's alibi cannot prevail over the positive evidence against him. His claim of being at the vice-lieutenant's house was directly contradicted by the vice-lieutenant himself, who testified Comigjod arrived much later than the time of the crime [4]. Furthermore, the appellant failed to present his wife to corroborate his alibi, likely because she had identified him as the killer [4]. Regarding the confession, the Justice of the Peace positively affirmed that the statement was translated to and voluntarily signed by the appellant, negating the claim of coercion [5].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the crime committed is murder qualified by treachery. The nature and location of the injuries found on the victim's body indicated that he was attacked from behind [6]. This physical evidence, combined with the circumstances set forth in the appellant's confession, sufficiently established the fact that the appellant acted with treachery [6].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [7].
