I. CAPTION
**BONIFACIO BROS., INC. and AYALA AUTO PARTS COMPANY v. ENRIQUE MORA and STATE BONDING & INSURANCE CO., INC.**, G.R. No. L-20853, May 29, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Enrique Mora mortgaged his Oldsmobile sedan to H.S. Reyes, Inc. and insured it with State Bonding & Insurance Co., Inc. The policy contained a clause stating: "Loss, if any, is payable to H.S. Reyes, Inc." as the mortgagee [1]. Following an accident, Mora authorized petitioners Bonifacio Bros., Inc. and Ayala Auto Parts Co. to repair the vehicle and supply materials, without the knowledge or consent of the mortgagee [2]. The insurer assessed the damage and issued a check for the proceeds (P2,002.73) payable to "Enrique Mora or H.S. Reyes, Inc." [2].

Petitioners filed a complaint for collection against Mora and the insurer. The insurer filed a counterclaim for interpleader to determine who had the better right to the proceeds: the repairmen or the mortgagee [3]. The Municipal Court and the Court of First Instance of Manila ruled that H.S. Reyes, Inc. had the better right [3], [4]. Petitioners appealed, arguing that the policy provision authorizing the insured to contract for repairs created a privity of contract between them and the insurer [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the repairmen (Petitioners) have a right to collect the insurance proceeds directly from the insurer based on the insurance contract.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Petitioners are not privy to the insurance contract and have no cause of action against the insurer [5]. Under **Article 1311 of the Civil Code**, contracts take effect only between the parties, unless the contract contains a *stipulation pour autrui* (a stipulation in favor of a third person) [5]. The Court ruled that for such a stipulation to exist, the parties must have clearly and deliberately conferred a favor upon the third person [6], [7]. The policy clause authorizing the insured to commission repairs is merely a procedural requirement for the insured to claim indemnity, not a provision intended to benefit the repairman [8], [9].

Furthermore, **Section 50 of the Insurance Act** provides that insurance shall be applied exclusively to the proper interest of the person in whose name it is made, unless otherwise specified [10], [11]. Here, the policy expressly stated that "Loss, if any, is payable to H.S. Reyes, Inc." [1]. As the designated beneficiary/mortgagee, H.S. Reyes, Inc. has a better right to the proceeds than the repairmen, who have no contract with the insurer [12]. The Court also held that "loss" in insurance law embraces "injury or damage," rejecting petitioners' distinction between the terms [11]. The judgment is affirmed [13].
