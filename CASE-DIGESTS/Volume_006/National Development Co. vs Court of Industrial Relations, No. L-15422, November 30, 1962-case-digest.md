I. CAPTION
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and NATIONAL TEXTILE WORKERS UNION, G.R. No. L-15422, November 30, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner National Development Company (NDC), a government-owned corporation, operated on four shifts. Each shift included a one-hour mealtime. NDC credited workers with eight hours of work per shift. However, since 1953, whenever workers were required to work two continuous shifts, NDC deducted the two hours corresponding to the mealtime periods and paid them for only six hours of the second shift. Respondent National Textile Workers Union demanded additional overtime pay for these meal periods. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled in favor of the Union, ordering NDC to pay P101,407.96. NDC filed a motion for reconsideration but failed to serve a copy to the Union, resulting in its dismissal by the CIR *en banc*. NDC appealed, challenging the CIR's jurisdiction and the compensability of the mealtimes.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has jurisdiction over the money claim.
2. W/N the mealtime breaks constitute compensable working time.
3. W/N the appeal is valid despite the failure to serve the motion for reconsideration on the adverse party.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The CIR has jurisdiction. Under the principle set in *Price Stabilization Corp. v. CIR* and *Campos v. Manila Railroad Co.*, where the employer-employee relationship exists and the claim arises under the Eight-Hour Labor Law, the CIR has jurisdiction [1], [2]. Here, the relationship is undisputed, and the claim is based on the Eight-Hour Labor Law [3].

2. **YES.** Under Section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 444, idle time is not counted as working time only when the work is not continuous and the laborer can leave the working place and rest completely [4]. The CIR found as a fact that work at NDC was continuous and employees could not freely leave their working places nor rest completely [5]. The Supreme Court is bound by the factual findings of the CIR when supported by evidence [6]. Thus, the mealtime breaks must be counted as working time for overtime compensation [7].

3. **NO.** A motion for reconsideration not served on the adverse party is treated as one filed outside the reglementary period [8]. Consequently, the dismissal of the motion was proper, and there is no decision of the CIR *en banc* that the petitioner can bring to the Supreme Court for review [9].

The order and resolution are **AFFIRMED** and the appeal is **DISMISSED** [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
