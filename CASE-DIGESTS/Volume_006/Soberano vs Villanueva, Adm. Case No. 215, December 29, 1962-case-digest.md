I. CAPTION
MERCEDES H. SOBERANO v. EUGENIO V. VILLANUEVA, Adm. Case No. 215, December 29, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Mercedes Soberano filed a petition for disbarment against Respondent Eugenio Villanueva, alleging that in December 1951, he induced her into a fake wedding, cohabited with her, and fathered two children before abandoning her [1]. Respondent denied the simulated marriage but admitted to having intimacy with the Complainant [2]. During the proceedings, Complainant attempted to withdraw her petition, then later claimed the withdrawal was secured through threats, though the Court found the withdrawal was voluntary based on her handwriting [2-4].

The evidence, specifically Complainant's letters to Respondent, revealed that their intimacy began in 1950, prior to the alleged 1951 "wedding," and continued with her full knowledge that they were not married. In a 1955 letter, she reminded him of his promise to marry her, and in 1953, she admitted to the NBI that she was not married to him [5, 6]. The intimacy complained of occurred before Respondent's admission to the Bar [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N there was a simulated marriage between the parties.
2. W/N the Respondent's pre-admission intimacy with the Complainant warrants disbarment.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court found the alleged fake marriage was purely a "figment of her imagination" and without factual basis [6]. Her own letters proved she did not consider him her husband, as she reminded him of his unfulfilled promise to marry her years after the alleged ceremony [5].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that while an attorney may be disbarred for misconduct committed before his admission to the Bar, such action is justified only if the act is "so corrupt and false as to constitute a criminal act or so unprincipled as to be reprehensible to a high degree" [7]. Intimacy between a man and a woman who are not married, especially under the circumstances of this case, is not considered so corrupt or unprincipled as to warrant disbarment [8].

The complaint against Respondent is **DISMISSED** [4].
