I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. VIVENCIO DE ROXAS and BIENVENIDO LAZARTE, G.R. No. L-16947, November 29, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On the night of October 12, 1954, in Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro, appellants Vivencio de Roxas and Bienvenido Lazarte, together with Leoncio Patulot (who later became a state witness), climbed into the house of Isidro Caunseran and his wife, Naciancina Jabal. Upon entry, Vivencio struck Isidro with a gun butt and stabbed him with a "balisong," causing his death. The appellants robbed the couple of P150.00 and took turns raping Naciancina. The Court of First Instance convicted the appellants of robbery with homicide and rape, sentencing them to death [1, 2]. The appellants argued they were not properly identified as the intruders wore masks, that their confessions were coerced, and that the alleged murder weapon (knife) could not have caused the wound due to discrepancies in dimensions [3-5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellants were properly identified as the perpetrators.
2. W/N the extrajudicial confessions were admissible despite allegations of coercion and lack of formal offer.
3. W/N the discrepancy between the knife's length and the wound's depth negates the appellants' guilt.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the appellants were properly identified by the widow, who saw their faces when the masks were removed during the crime, and by the state witness. The Court ruled that a witness's inability to describe the culprits to the police does not detract from the veracity of her recognition, as "recognition and description are different processes that do not necessarily go together" [3, 6, 7].

2. **YES.** The claim of coercion was rejected because the confessions were executed before the Vice-Governor and Mayor, to whom the appellants made no complaints or showed injuries [4]. Regarding the procedural defect, the Court ruled that the absence of a record of the formal presentation of exhibits is not a reversible error if repeated references during the trial and court orders convincingly show the documents were part of the prosecution's evidence [8, 9].

3. **NO.** Citing *Gross' Criminal Investigation*, the Court explained that the variance between the weapon's dimensions and the wound is not significant. The elasticity of the body can cause a wound to appear deeper than the blade length due to the compression of tissues during the blow, or narrower/wider due to skin stretching [5, 10, 11].

The judgment was **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**, reducing the penalty to life imprisonment due to the lack of sufficient votes for the death penalty [12].
