I. CAPTION
ERNESTO PALMA, et al. v. JOSE MANDOCDOC, et al., G.R. No. L-17393, November 28, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On January 17, 1960, petitioners were proclaimed elected as barrio officials of Labac, Cuenca, Batangas during an election held by the Barrio Assembly [1, 2]. Subsequently, on January 21, 1960, the former Barrio Lieutenant convened another meeting where respondents were elected to the same positions [3]. Petitioners filed a complaint for *quo warranto* in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Batangas, seeking to be declared the rightful officials and to oust respondents [4]. Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that under Section 7 of the Barrio Autonomy Act (R.A. 2370), jurisdiction over barrio election disputes lies with the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court, not the CFI [4]. The CFI dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that the statute covers "all disputes" without exception [5]. Petitioners appealed, contending that the JP Court's jurisdiction is limited to election contests and does not cover disputes regarding the validity of the election itself [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the dispute regarding the validity of the barrio election.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal, holding that jurisdiction lies with the Justice of the Peace Court. Paragraph 6, Section 7 of the Barrio Autonomy Act (R.A. 2370) explicitly confers jurisdiction upon JP courts over "all disputes over barrio elections" [6]. The Court ruled that this phrase is absolute and imperative, rebutting any argument that jurisdiction is limited only to disputes where the election validity is not contested [6]. This broad jurisdiction is intended to provide prompt and inexpensive solutions to barrio election controversies [6]. Furthermore, although petitioners labeled their suit as *quo warranto*, their allegations regarding irregularities in the conduct of the election made the action, in substance, an election contest [7]. Under the Election Code, *quo warranto* is limited to issues of disloyalty or ineligibility, while irregularities are grounds for protest cognizable by the JP court [7].

The order of dismissal is affirmed [8].
