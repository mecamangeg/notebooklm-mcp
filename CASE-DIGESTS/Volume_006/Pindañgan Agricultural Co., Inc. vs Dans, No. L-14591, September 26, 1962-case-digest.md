I. CAPTION
PINDAÑGAN AGRICULTURAL COMPANY, INC. v. JOSE P. DANS, et al., G.R. No. L-14591, September 26, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Pindañgan Agricultural Co., Inc. sought to acquire 491.99 hectares of agricultural land in Pangasinan. The Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources denied the corporation's petition, ruling that the land should be awarded to the actual occupants. The corporation filed suit, claiming it represented 93 heads of families (original tenants) who had assigned their rights and interests to the corporation. The Supreme Court rendered a decision adverse to the corporation.

Subsequently, the corporation filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing for the first time that the Supreme Court lost jurisdiction over the case due to the enactment of Republic Act No. 2613 on August 1, 1959, which increased the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to P200,000. The corporation contended the case should have been remanded to the Court of Appeals or that the Supreme Court should have limited its review to questions of law based on the lower court's findings.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court lost jurisdiction over the appeal due to the enactment of R.A. No. 2613.
2. W/N the corporation acquired preferential rights to the land through assignment from the original tenants.
3. W/N the findings of the Director of Lands and Secretary of Agriculture awarding the land to actual occupants are subject to judicial review.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** An appellant who files a brief and submits the case for decision without questioning the court's jurisdiction until an adverse decision is rendered is considered to have waived the claim regarding jurisdiction [1]. To rule otherwise would encourage the undesirable practice of speculating on a favorable judgment before attacking jurisdiction [2, 3]. Furthermore, the Court took judicial notice that the 491.99 hectares located in Pangasinan, a productive rice granary, are worth at least P500 per hectare, placing the value above P200,000 and within the Supreme Court's jurisdiction [4].

2. **NO.** Under Act No. 3038 and Section 20 of the Public Land Act (C.A. No. 141), the sale or lease of government agricultural land is subject to specific limitations [5]. A transfer or assignment of rights by original occupants/tenants cannot be made without the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources [6]. The corporation failed to show such approval; thus, the assignments were illegal and the corporation could not claim preference to lease or purchase the land [6, 7].

3. **NO.** Findings and conclusions of the Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture regarding the award of land to actual occupants are generally not subject to judicial review [8, 9]. The Court found no abuse of discretion in the officials' decision to award the land to the occupants rather than the corporation [10, 11].

The Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
