I. CAPTION
DOMINGO IMPERIAL, ET AL. v. MANILA TIMES PUBLISHING CO., INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-17430, November 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Domingo Imperial and Sixto Brillantes, Chairman and Member of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) respectively, filed a libel suit against defendants Manila Times Publishing Co., Inc. and its reporter, Jose L. Guevara [1]. The complaint stemmed from a June 2, 1957 news article titled "BALLOT BOX CONTRACTS HIT," and a subsequent editorial, which alleged irregularities and "venalities" in the COMELEC's awarding of contracts for ballot boxes [1, 2].

The Court of First Instance of Rizal, Quezon City Branch IV, ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, ordering defendants to pay P10,000.00 as moral damages and P5,000.00 as exemplary damages to *each* of the two plaintiffs [3]. The defendants appealed directly to the Supreme Court, alleging errors in the lower court's finding that the publications were libelous and that the defendants were negligent [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the appeal was erroneously directed to the Supreme Court. The amount involved in the judgment (P15,000.00 for each plaintiff) is far below the amount required for the Supreme Court to acquire appellate jurisdiction [4]. Furthermore, the errors assigned by the defendants—concerning the character of the articles and the existence of negligence—are questions of fact [4]. Under Sections 17(5), (6), and 29 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended, issues of fact and amounts below the jurisdictional threshold fall within the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals [4].

Case remanded to the Court of Appeals for proper action [5].
