**I. CAPTION**
**AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND COOPERATIVE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION (ACCFA) v. GOYENA LUMBER COMPANY, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-18078, October 31, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Bugallon Facoma constructed a warehouse using materials supplied by Goyena Lumber Company but mortgaged the structure to petitioner ACCFA to secure a loan [1, 2]. When Bugallon Facoma failed to pay for the materials, Goyena Lumber filed a collection suit (Civil Case No. 602), obtained a favorable judgment, and levied on the warehouse [2]. ACCFA filed a third-party claim but failed to prosecute it, leading to the warehouse being sold at public auction to Goyena Lumber on March 3, 1958 [2].

Subsequently, ACCFA filed a foreclosure suit against Bugallon Facoma (Civil Case No. 13849), without including Goyena Lumber, and purchased the warehouse at the foreclosure sale [3]. On October 14, 1959, ACCFA filed a case (Civil Case No. D-988) to enjoin Goyena Lumber from demolishing the warehouse [3]. This case was dismissed on the merits, with the court declaring Goyena Lumber the owner because ACCFA had slept on its rights; this decision became final [3, 4]. ACCFA then filed the present action (Civil Case No. 13943) again seeking an injunction, recovery of the warehouse, and foreclosure of Goyena Lumber's equity of redemption [5]. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground of *res judicata* [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the dismissal of the amended complaint on the ground of *res judicata* was proper.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that all requisites of *res judicata* were present: (a) a final judgment; (b) jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties; (c) a judgment on the merits; and (d) identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action [6].

The Court rejected ACCFA's argument that there was no identity of capacity because it sued as a mortgagee in the first injunction case (Civil Case No. D-988) and as an owner in the present case [7]. The Court ruled that the difference in capacity is of no consequence because the parties are the same and the subject litigated refers to the same property [8]. Where a party appears in different capacities but is effectively litigating the same right, the requisite identity of parties exists [8]. Furthermore, the addition of a cause of action for the foreclosure of the equity of redemption was immaterial, as it was based on the alleged ownership of the warehouse which had already been conclusively settled in the former case [8].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred with the decision [9].
