I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO BOIX and JOSE SILVESTRE v. HON. MELQUIADES G. ILAO and MARICHU BATALLA, G.R. No. L-20010, October 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Marichu Batalla filed a complaint claiming a right to use a road and log pond located on the land of petitioners Francisco Boix and Jose Silvestre to transport logs from her timber concession. Initially, the trial court issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining petitioners from obstructing Batalla’s passage. However, on June 18, 1962, respondent Judge Ilao dissolved the writ, explicitly finding that the road was private property belonging to the petitioners and that Batalla had not acquired any right to use it [1, 2].

Batalla moved for reconsideration, alleging she faced irreparable damage because she needed to ship 1,000,000 board feet of logs to Japan by July 15, 1962 [3]. Solely based on this urgency, Judge Ilao issued an order on July 13, 1962, reviving the mandatory injunction and ordering petitioners to remove roadblocks, without setting aside his previous finding that Batalla lacked a legal right to the road [2, 4]. Petitioners filed for certiorari to nullify this order.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in reviving the mandatory injunction allowing Batalla to use the private road.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that it was irregular, improper, and a grave abuse of discretion for the trial court to issue or revive a mandatory injunction compelling an owner to permit the use of his private road by someone who, up to that time, the court had declared not to have acquired any right to use the same [5, 6].

The Court held that the revival of the injunction based merely on Batalla's representation of urgent business commitments (loading logs for shipment) constituted no sufficient justification to use Boix's road against his will [2]. This is particularly true where the lower court had not set aside its order of June 18, 1962, which expressly declared the road belonged to the defendants and the plaintiff had no right to use it [2].

The order of the respondent court of July 13, 1962 was set aside, and the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Supreme Court was made permanent [7].
