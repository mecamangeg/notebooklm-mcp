I. CAPTION
MANUEL A. CORDERO and VICENTE SALAZAR v. HON. JOSE R. CABATUANDO and LEONARDO STA. ROMANA, G.R. No. L-14542, October 31, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Manuel A. Cordero, a Trial Attorney of the Tenancy Unit, Department of Justice (DOJ), represented indigent tenant Vicente Salazar in a case before the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). The respondent landlord filed a motion to disqualify Cordero. Respondent Judge Cabatuando granted the motion, ruling that under Republic Act (RA) No. 1199, representation of indigent tenants was the duty of Department of Labor (DOL) public defenders, and the DOJ Tenancy Unit was *ultra vires*. Cordero filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Supreme Court. While the case was pending, Congress enacted RA 2263, amending RA 1199 to explicitly transfer the function of representing tenants to the DOJ. Respondent Judge contended that RA 2263 was unconstitutional because the creation of the Tenancy Mediation Division was not expressed in the title of the bill, violating the constitutional requirement that no bill shall embrace more than one subject which shall be expressed in the title.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Sections 19 and 20 of RA 2263 are unconstitutional for embracing a subject not expressed in the title of the bill.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the constitutional requirement is satisfied if all parts of the law are related and germane to the subject matter expressed in the title. The title of RA 2263, "An Act Amending Certain Sections of Republic Act Numbered One Thousand One Hundred Ninety-Nine, Otherwise Known as the Agricultural Tenancy Act of the Philippines," covers the general subject of agricultural tenancy.

The Court reasoned that the amendatory provisions transferring the representation of indigent tenants to the DOJ are germane to and reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the general subject of the law [1]. Citing *Sumulong v. Commission on Elections* and *People v. Carlos*, the Court emphasized that the title need not be a complete index of the act's contents; it is sufficient if the provisions are subordinate to the act's end [2, 3]. The amendment merely transferred functions from one department to another to consolidate the enforcement of tenancy laws [4].

Petition granted; writ of preliminary injunction made permanent.
