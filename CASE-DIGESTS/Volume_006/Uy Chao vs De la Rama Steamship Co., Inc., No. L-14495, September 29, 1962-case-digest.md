I. CAPTION
VICENTE UY CHAO v. DE LA RAMA STEAMSHIP CO., INC., G.R. No. L-14495, September 29, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On February 11, 1958, petitioner Vicente Uy Chao filed an action against respondent De la Rama Steamship Co., Inc. to collect a sum of money for purchases made in 1941. The respondent moved to dismiss on the ground of prescription. The petitioner opposed, arguing that the ten-year prescriptive period was interrupted by debt moratorium statutes (E.O. Nos. 25 and 32, and R.A. No. 342). The applicability of the extended moratorium under R.A. No. 342 depended on the factual question of whether the respondent was a war sufferer who had filed a war damage claim [1].

The trial court set a hearing to receive evidence on this specific fact. On July 10, 1958, the petitioner served a written request for admission under Rule 23 requiring the respondent to admit it was a war sufferer and had filed a claim. The respondent moved to strike the request, arguing it was premature because no answer had been filed yet, and thus pleadings were not "closed" as required by the Rules [2]. The trial court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the petitioner failed to prove the respondent’s status and that the request for admission was improper at that stage [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a request for admission regarding a specific fact is proper pending a motion to dismiss and before the filing of an answer.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal. While Rule 23 (now Rule 26) generally requires requests for admission to be made "after the pleadings are closed," the purpose of the rule is to expedite trial by avoiding the need to prove undisputed facts [5, 6].

The Court held that questions of fact are usually inquired into during the "stage of proof." However, when a motion to dismiss accelerates this stage regarding a particular relevant fact (here, the status as a war sufferer), the purpose of the rule comes into play. Insofar as that specific fact is concerned, the issue is considered joined, and the pleadings are deemed closed within the meaning of Rule 23 [6]. To rule otherwise would substitute technicality for substance. Furthermore, because the factual issue remained unresolved, the ground for dismissal was not "indubitable," and the lower court should have allowed the request for admission to resolve the matter [7].

The orders appealed from are SET ASIDE, and the court *a quo* is directed to give due course to the appellant’s request for admission [8].
