I. CAPTION
ATLANTIC MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY v. MANILA PORT SERVICE AND/OR MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-16789, October 31, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Pfizer Corporation shipped goods to Pfizer Laboratories (Phil.) Inc. in Manila, insured by Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company. The goods arrived on March 19, 1958, and were discharged to the custody of the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service (MPS), on March 20, 1958 [1]. When MPS delivered the cargo to the consignee on April 10, 1958, there were missing and damaged items totaling P668.93 [1]. Atlantic Mutual paid the insurance claim and filed a suit against MPS on March 3, 1959 for recovery [2]. MPS argued that the suit was barred because the consignee failed to file a claim for loss within 15 days from the discharge of the last package, a condition required under Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract between MPS and the Bureau of Customs [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Atlantic Mutual, holding that the suit was not barred because it was filed within one year [4]. MPS appealed, contending the 15-day claim is a condition precedent [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the consignee is bound by the 15-day claim limitation in the Management Contract, barring the suit, despite not being a signatory to said contract.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that the filing of a claim with the arrastre operator within 15 days from the date of discharge is a valid condition precedent to filing a court action [5, 6]. While the consignee was not a signatory to the Management Contract between the Bureau of Customs and MPS, the consignee is nonetheless bound by its provisions. The Court relied on the doctrine in *Tomas Grocery vs. Delgado Brothers, Inc.*, explaining that the consignee (via its broker) used gate passes and delivery permits which explicitly reproduced the pertinent portion of Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract [7]. By using these documents to withdraw the goods and accepting the benefit of delivery, the consignee accepted the stipulations therein [7, 8]. Since no claim was filed within the 15-day period, the action was barred.

The judgment appealed from is reversed and the complaint dismissed [8].
