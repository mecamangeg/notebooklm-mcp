I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JOSE TUAZON, et al., G.R. No. L-10614, October 22, 1962, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
Due to a long-standing land dispute and litigation between Mariano Tabaniag and Ballao Hermoso, Tabaniag conspired to kill Ballao. On June 16, 1954, meetings were held where Tabaniag offered a P400.00 reward for Ballao's death. Co-accused Mayor Jose Tuazon and Hilario Taberdo induced the others to accept. The group, including police officer Jeremias Leppago, slept at Mayor Tuazon's house before the attack.

On the morning of June 17, 1954, as Ballao Hermoso and his nephew Masibag Hermoso were riding to a court hearing regarding the land dispute, they were ambushed at Baay River by the armed group. Both were shot and killed. Felipe Tadeo, a companion on foot, hid and identified the attackers. One of the conspirators, Marcelino Artero, was discharged to become a state witness. The Court of First Instance convicted the eight accused of murder. It found the inductors (Tabaniag, Tuazon, and Taberdo) guilty only of Ballao's death, while the actual ambushers were found guilty of both deaths.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused are guilty of murder based on the testimony of a discharged state witness and an eyewitness despite the defense of alibi.
2. W/N the principals by induction (inductors) are criminally liable for the death of the victim's companion (Masibag) which was not part of the original agreement.
3. W/N the penalty of death should be imposed on the mastermind, Mariano Tabaniag.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the conviction, relying on the positive identification by eyewitness Felipe Tadeo and the testimony of state witness Marcelino Artero. The Court ruled that Artero's initial denial of participation before becoming a state witness did not detract from his credibility, as it is natural to evade responsibility. The defense of alibi was rejected because it was physically possible for the accused to be together, and evidence showed they slept at Mayor Tuazon's house. The extra-judicial confessions were also admitted as there was no credible proof of maltreatment.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the inductors—Mariano Tabaniag, Mayor Jose Tuazon, and Hilario Taberdo—are guilty only of the murder of Ballao Hermoso. The agreement and reward were specifically for killing Ballao to eliminate him as a distinct enemy in a land dispute. Since there was no evidence that they ordered the killing of his companion, Masibag Hermoso, they cannot be held liable for his death. However, the direct participants who ambushed the victims are guilty of double murder for killing both men.

3. **YES.** While the other accused were sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*, the Court modified the penalty for Mariano Tabaniag to **death**. The Court reasoned that Tabaniag deserved the supreme penalty because he not only offered the reward but also employed a group of more than six armed men to ensure the execution of his "diabolical purpose."

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**, imposing the death penalty on Mariano Tabaniag.
