I. CAPTION
GAVINO LAO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17053, October 30, 1962, 6 SCRA 677, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On April 22, 1958, Gavino Lao filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Leyte [1]. The Government opposed the petition, pointing out that Lao had lived with Ricarda Javier for almost eight years since 1949 without the benefit of marriage, during which time they begot three children [2]. Lao only married Javier in a civil ceremony on April 18, 1958—four days before filing his petition for naturalization [2]. Lao contended that their relationship did not create a scandal and that the marriage evidenced his sincere desire to comply with legal requirements [2]. The trial court granted the petition, ruling Lao was qualified [1]. The Government appealed [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is qualified to become a Filipino citizen despite his eight-year cohabitation without the benefit of marriage.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner is not qualified. The Court reasoned that the applicant's eight-year cohabitation with his wife without the benefit of clergy, and begetting three children out of lawful wedlock, is conduct "far from being proper and irreproachable as required by the Revised Naturalization Law" [3]. The Court cited the precedents of *Sy Kiam v. Republic* and *Tak Ng v. Republic* to support this conclusion [3]. Additionally, the Court noted that Lao's annual income as a businessman was only P1,600, which is not considered lucrative under the doctrine in *Koa Gui v. Republic* [3].

The decree appealed from is reversed and the petition for naturalization is denied [4].
