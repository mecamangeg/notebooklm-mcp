I. CAPTION
ESTEBAN CUAJAO v. CHUA LO TAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16298, September 29, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Esteban Cuajao worked as a family driver for defendant Chua Lo Tan from August 1, 1951, to November 4, 1956, earning P5.00 daily [1]. During his employment, Cuajao was hospitalized for a total of 35 days for hemorrhoids, spending P435.80 for hospitalization and medicine [1, 2]. He also did not utilize any vacation leave, which allegedly accumulated to 316 days worth P1,580.00 [1]. Upon separation, Cuajao filed a complaint to recover the accumulated vacation leave pay and reimbursement for his hospitalization expenses [3].

The Court of First Instance of Manila rejected the claim for vacation leave, ruling that Cuajao waived it by failing to demand payment as it accrued [4]. However, the lower court ordered Chua Lo Tan to pay P435.80 for hospitalization expenses [3]. Both parties appealed: Cuajao questioned the denial of leave pay, while Chua Lo Tan questioned the award of hospitalization expenses [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Cuajao is entitled to payment for accumulated vacation leave despite failing to demand it during his employment.
2. W/N the term "medical attendance" under Article 1689 of the Civil Code includes expenses for hospitalization incurred by a house helper without the employer's knowledge or consent.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The purpose of vacation leave is to afford a laborer a chance to rest and replenish worn-out energies to efficiently perform duties, not merely to provide additional salary or bounty [5]. This privilege must be demanded at the opportune time; if the employee allows years to go by in silence, he waives it [5]. The Court affirmed the lower court's finding that Cuajao waived this right by not making seasonable demands during his six years of service [4]. The Court relied on the doctrine established in *Sun Ripe Coconut Products, Inc. vs. National Labor Union* [5].

2. **NO.** While the Court did not abstractly decide if "medical attendance" covers hospitalization, it ruled that the right is subject to the "rule of necessity" and the circumstances of each case [6]. Here, Cuajao failed to prove the necessity of his confinement (e.g., through expert testimony) and did not inform his employer of the illness or hospitalization [2]. Furthermore, except in cases of extreme urgency, the party defraying the cost must have a say in the choice of physician and hospital [2]. Since Chua Lo Tan was denied this choice, he cannot be held liable.

The award for hospitalization expenses is **SET ASIDE**, and the decision is **AFFIRMED** in all other respects.
