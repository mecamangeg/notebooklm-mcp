I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JULIAN MONTON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16772, November 30, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On May 7, 1956, defendants Julian Monton and others sent a letter to President Ramon Magsaysay denouncing Jose J. Monteclaro, the Second Assistant City Fiscal of Iloilo. The letter accused Monteclaro of illegal and oppressive acts, including obstructing an irrigation system to prejudice other farmers and using his office for personal gain and to benefit relatives [1-3]. The Provincial Fiscal of Iloilo filed an Information for libel against the defendants, alleging that the letter was written with "malicious intent and evil motive" to injure Monteclaro's reputation [1].

The defendants filed a motion to quash, arguing that the letter was a privileged communication under Article 354, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code, as it was a private communication made in the performance of a legal, moral, or social duty [4, 5]. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo granted the motion and dismissed the case, ruling that the letter was indeed privileged and thus not libelous [6]. The Solicitor General appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the privileged character of an alleged libelous communication constitutes a legal basis for the dismissal of the information upon a motion to quash.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal was reversible error. While Article 354 of the Revised Penal Code provides that a private communication made in the performance of a legal, moral, or social duty is not presumed to be malicious, this qualified privilege does not render the communication non-actionable; it merely rebuts the presumption of malice [7].

When a communication is qualifiedly privileged, the burden simply shifts to the prosecution to prove that actual malice existed [7]. The Information in this case specifically alleged that the defendants acted with "malicious intent and evil motive" [8]. Therefore, the prosecution was entitled to a trial to present evidence proving this allegation [8]. The Court cited *People v. Wenceslao Pascual* and *Lu Chu Sing v. Lu Tiong Cui*, reiterating that the privileged character of a communication is a matter of defense and does not justify dismissing the complaint before trial [9].

The Order appealed from was SET ASIDE and the case was REMANDED to the lower court for further proceedings [10].
