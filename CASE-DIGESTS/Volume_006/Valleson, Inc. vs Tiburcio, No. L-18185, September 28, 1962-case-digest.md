I. CAPTION
VALLESON, INC. v. BESSIE C. TIBURCIO, G.R. No. L-18185, September 28, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Tiburcio was employed as a cashier by petitioner Valleson, Inc. from 1955 to 1957. She was paid P3.50 per day for seven hours of work. During her employment, she was denied maternity leave pay for her first and second pregnancies. In November 1957, following an investigation revealing cash shortages and unauthorized lending of company funds, she was dismissed.

On April 6, 1960, Tiburcio filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) claiming differential pay (to meet the statutory minimum wage), maternity leave pay, and reinstatement. The CIR rendered a decision granting the wage differential (P0.50 per day) and maternity leave pay but dismissing the reinstatement claim. Valleson, Inc. appealed, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over claims for differential pay based on the statutory minimum wage and maternity leave pay absent an actual strike.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) does not have jurisdiction.

Regarding the claim for differential pay, Section 16 of Republic Act No. 602 (Minimum Wage Law) limits the CIR's jurisdiction over minimum wage cases to instances where: (1) the dispute concerns minimum wages *above* the applicable statutory minimum; or (2) the demand for minimum wages involves an *actual strike*. In this case, Tiburcio's claim was based on the statutory minimum of P4.00 a day, not a higher wage, and the demand did not involve an actual strike. Therefore, the case does not fall under the CIR's jurisdiction [1].

Regarding the claim for maternity leave pay, such claims are *per se* beyond the jurisdiction of the CIR. While the CIR may exercise jurisdiction over such claims if they are incidental to a main case properly within its jurisdiction (like a valid Minimum Wage Law case), the lack of jurisdiction over the principal claim for differential pay necessarily divests the Court of jurisdiction over the incidental maternity leave claim [1-3].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is reversed and the case is dismissed [4].
