I. CAPTION
ARTURO NIETO v. BARTOLOME QUINES and MIGUEL P. PIO, G.R. No. L-14643, September 29, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
In 1917, Bartolome Quines filed a homestead application for a tract of land in Abulug, Cagayan, which was approved in 1918. He began cultivating the land. Subsequently, cadastral proceedings were initiated in 1927, covering the same land designated as Lot No. 3044. Quines did not file an answer in the cadastral case, relying on assurances from Bureau of Lands employees. However, Maria Florentino (predecessor-in-interest of petitioner Arturo Nieto) filed a claim for Lot No. 3044.

On August 16, 1930, the cadastral court rendered a decision awarding the lot to Florentino. No appeal was taken, and this decision became final on September 15, 1930. Meanwhile, on August 29, 1930, a homestead patent was issued to Quines, and his Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 623 was issued on September 15, 1930. Florentino’s OCT No. 11982 was issued later on March 12, 1931.

The Supreme Court initially promulgated a decision on January 28, 1961, ruling in favor of Quines based on his vested rights. Nieto filed a Motion for Reconsideration.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a certificate of title obtained through judicial cadastral proceedings prevails over a certificate of title issued pursuant to a homestead patent when both became effective on the same date.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the title acquired through judicial proceedings must prevail. Although both titles technically became effective on September 15, 1930 (the date Quines' title was issued and the date the cadastral judgment for Florentino became final), the nature of the proceedings differs. Proceedings under the Cadastral Act (Act 2259) are judicial and *in rem*, binding the whole world, including the Government. Conversely, homestead proceedings under the Public Land Act (Act 926) are purely administrative.

When the cadastral court adjudicated the land to Florentino on August 16, 1930, the Government—bound by that decision—no longer had the right to convey the same land to Quines via homestead patent on August 29, 1930. Furthermore, a cadastral title becomes incontrovertible after one year (Sec. 38, Land Registration Act), while a homestead title remains subject to administrative reversion and other conditions (Sec. 122, Land Registration Act). Thus, when an administrative title conflicts with a judicial title obtained on the same date, the latter prevails.

The Decision of January 28, 1961 was **RECONSIDERED** and **SET ASIDE**. The lower court's decision was **REVERSED**, declaring Nieto's title (derived from Florentino) as the true and valid title.
