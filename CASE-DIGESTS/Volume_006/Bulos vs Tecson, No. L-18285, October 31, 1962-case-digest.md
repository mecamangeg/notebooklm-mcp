**I. CAPTION**
**IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF DON PABLO TECSON OCAMPO; TOMASA V. BULOS, Petitioner and Administratrix-Appellee, v. VICENTE TECSON, Oppositor-Appellee, JOSE TANTOCO, Movant-Appellant.**
G.R. No. L-18285, October 31, 1962, Concepcion, J. [1-3]

**II. FACTS**
Pablo Tecson died in Manila on April 30, 1940 [3]. His widow, Tomasa V. Bulos, initiated probate proceedings, and the will was allowed in October 1940 [3]. Thirteen years later, on November 28, 1953, Jose Tecson Tantoco (Appellant) filed a motion claiming to be an illegitimate child of the deceased and seeking a share of the estate under the New Civil Code [4]. It was stipulated that Jose was born in 1904 to Pablo and Felisa Tantoco while Pablo was married to another woman; thus, Jose was an illegitimate (not natural) child [4]. Vicente Tecson (Oppositor) objected.

The Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija denied Jose's motion [5]. It held that because Pablo died in 1940, the Civil Code of 1889 (Spanish Civil Code) applied [5]. Under that Code, illegitimate children who are not natural children are entitled only to support, not a legitime [5]. The lower court ruled that rights vested upon death in 1940 and could not be impaired by the New Civil Code [5]. Jose appealed, arguing that Articles 287 and 2264 of the New Civil Code should apply retroactively to grant him successional rights [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the illegitimate child can retroactively claim successional rights under the New Civil Code when the father died before its effectivity.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court ruled that the New Civil Code provisions do not apply to the inheritance of a person who died before its enactment [7].

While Article 2264 of the New Civil Code extends successional rights to illegitimate children born before the Code's effectivity, this applies only if the illegitimate father dies *after* the Code became effective [7]. Article 2263 explicitly provides that "rights to the inheritance of a person who died, with or without will, *before* the effectivity of this Code, shall be governed by the Civil Code of 1889, by other previous laws and by the Rules of Court" [7].

Since Pablo Tecson died in 1940, prior to the New Civil Code, his estate is governed by the Civil Code of 1889 [7]. Under the old law, the Appellant, being an illegitimate child not having the status of a natural child, is not entitled to inheritance but only to support [5]. The Court cited *Uson v. Del Rosario* and *Montilla v. Montilla* to affirm that rights vested under the old legislation cannot be impaired by the new Code [7].

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED**. [8]
