I. CAPTION
ALLISON J. GIBBS and ESTHER K. GIBBS v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE and COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-17008, October 31, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
In 1950, petitioners were assessed a deficiency income tax of P12,284.00 resulting from the disallowance of a claimed loss regarding Japanese sequestered mortgages [1]. Petitioners paid the tax under protest on October 3, 1956, and requested a refund, which the Commissioner denied on October 26, 1956 [2]. Petitioners filed a petition for review (CTA Case No. 418) only on September 17, 1957. The CTA dismissed this petition for being filed beyond the 30-day period prescribed in R.A. 1125, a ruling affirmed by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-13453 on February 29, 1960 [2, 3].

During the pendency of the first appeal, the BIR issued new deficiency assessments for the years 1952-1956. Petitioners requested the Commissioner to reconsider the P12,284.00 refund to credit it against these new deficiencies, arguing inconsistencies in the BIR's treatment of similar losses in other years [4, 5]. Receiving no reply, they filed a new petition (CTA Case No. 585) on October 2, 1958, involving the same P12,284.00 [5]. The CTA dismissed this second petition, holding that the decision in the first case was decisive [3]. Petitioners appealed, arguing the relief sought (credit vs. refund) and the basis (subsequent BIR actions) distinguished the second case from the first [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners' second action for refund/credit is barred by the judgment in the first case.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that a fact or question actually or directly in issue in a former suit, which was judicially passed upon and determined, is conclusively settled by the judgment therein and cannot be litigated again in any future action [7]. The subject matter in both cases is the same amount of P12,284.00 paid under protest [6].

The Court applied the doctrine that "a party cannot, by varying the form of action, or adopting a different method of presenting his case, escape the operation of the principle that one and the same cause of action shall not be twice litigated between the same parties or their privies" (citing *Peñalosa v. Tuason* and *Tejador v. Palet*) [7]. The settled policy of the law forbids a matter once adjudicated to be drawn in issue again while the former adjudication remains in force [8].

The Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals was **affirmed** [8].
