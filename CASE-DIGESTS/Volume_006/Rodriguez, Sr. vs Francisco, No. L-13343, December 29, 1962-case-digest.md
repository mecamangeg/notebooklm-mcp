**I. CAPTION**
EULOGIO RODRIGUEZ, SR. v. SOFRONIO FRANCISCO, as Administrator of the Estate of MAXIMO FRANCISCO, G.R. No. L-13343, December 29, 1962, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Exequiel Ampil, the registered owner of land under OCT 2497, sold the property to Maximo Francisco in 1924 [1, 2]. Francisco took possession and paid taxes but did not register the sale [2]. In 1933, Ampil conditionally sold the same land to Petitioner Rodriguez to guarantee debts [3]. Rodriguez consolidated ownership in 1936 and secured TCT 81204 in 1937, but Francisco remained in possession [4]. On January 20, 1949, Rodriguez filed a complaint for recovery of possession and damages [5]. The trial court declared Rodriguez the rightful owner (affirmed by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-12039) but ruled that Francisco was a possessor in good faith and not liable for damages [6]. Rodriguez appealed, questioning the finding of good faith [6, 7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the respondent is liable for damages (fruits) as a possessor in bad faith.

**IV. RULING**
**YES, but only from the time of judicial summons.** The Court ruled that Francisco’s possession began in good faith by virtue of the 1924 deed of sale, which was valid sufficient title for possession despite the lack of registration [5]. Under **Articles 528 and 529 of the Civil Code**, possession acquired in good faith is presumed to continue in the same character until proven otherwise [5].

However, good faith ceases when the possessor becomes aware that his right is wrongful or disputed. Under **Article 1123 of the Civil Code**, civil interruption is produced by judicial summons [8]. Consequently, per **Article 544**, the possessor loses the right to the fruits from the date of such interruption [8]. Citing *Tacas v. Tobon*, the Court held that service of summons marks the point where a possessor knows his right is insecure [8, 9].

Regarding the amount, damages accruing prior to Maximo Francisco's death in 1950 are debts of the decedent and must be claimed in the administration proceedings (**Rule 87, Sec. 5**) [10]. Damages accruing after death are recoverable in this ordinary action [10]. Due to lack of evidence for the 1950 harvest, liability attaches starting 1951 [10].

**Judgment MODIFIED.** The Respondent estate is ordered to pay Petitioner P200.00 yearly from 1951 until possession is restored [11].
