I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CATALINO ORTEZA, G.R. No. L-16033, September 29, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of January 5, 1957, in Infanta, Quezon, Marianita Ruidera was sleeping at home while her husband was away. She was awakened by Catalino Orteza, who held a *balisong* to her throat and demanded "something." Under threat of death to her and her family, and utilizing force, Orteza succeeded in raping her [1, 2]. He also stole P2.00 from under her pillow and P50.00 from an *aparador* [2]. Marianita recognized Orteza by the light of a fluorescent bulb [1].

Although she initially kept silent due to Orteza's threats, she eventually revealed his identity to the authorities [3, 4]. Orteza was arrested, executed an extrajudicial confession, and re-enacted the crime [5]. He was charged with robbery with rape and physical injuries. During trial, Orteza interposed the defense of alibi, claiming he was drinking and gambling elsewhere, and repudiated his confession claiming maltreatment [6, 7]. The Court of First Instance of Quezon convicted him. Orteza appealed, challenging the credibility of the victim and noting the lack of a medical examination confirming rape [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over the positive identification by the victim.
2. W/N a medical examination is indispensable for a conviction of rape.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the appellant's uncorroborated alibi cannot prevail against the offended party's clear and positive identification [10]. Marianita had known the appellant for many years, and the scene was sufficiently illuminated by a fluorescent bulb [10]. It is the natural reaction of a victim of criminal violence to strive to know the identity of the assailant [10]. Furthermore, the appellant's confession contained details that could only have been known by the perpetrator, and his claim of maltreatment was negated by his voluntary re-enactment of the crime [7].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that a medical examination is not an indispensable element in the prosecution for the crime of rape [9]. Conviction depends upon the evidence offered; as long as such evidence convinces the court, a conviction is proper regardless of the absence of a medical exam [9]. The Court cited *People v. Belandres*, *People v. Suarez*, and *People v. Selfaison* in support of this doctrine [9].

The decision of the lower court was **MODIFIED**. Finding the accused guilty of robbery with rape under Article 294(2) of the Revised Penal Code, with aggravating circumstances of nocturnity and dwelling, the Court sentenced Orteza to suffer the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* and to indemnify the victim [11].
