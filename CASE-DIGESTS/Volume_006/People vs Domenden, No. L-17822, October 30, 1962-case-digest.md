I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LEOPOLDO DOMENDEN and EUFEMIO SEGUNDO, G.R. No. L-17822, October 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On January 16, 1958, at around 1:00 A.M., Jovita Antolin, her son Pedro Antolin, Jr., and companions Norberto Vargas, Jaime Foronda, and Jovencio Ismael were walking home in Barrio Dayangki, Burgos, Ilocos Sur after watching a *zarzuela*. Jovita saw the accused Leopoldo Domenden and Eufemio Segundo walking ahead of them. Suddenly, the accused retreated, kneeled, and without warning fired a .45 caliber pistol and a carbine at the group. Foronda, Ismael, and Pedro Jr. were killed. Jovita recognized the accused and shouted their nicknames ("Pemyong" and "Poldo"), asking why they committed the crime. In response, Domenden shot Jovita again. She feigned death to survive.

The accused interposed the defense of alibi, claiming they were at the municipal building or at home (only 70 meters away) when the crime occurred. They also argued that Jovita failed to identify them immediately during the initial investigation. The Court of First Instance convicted them of Multiple Murder and Frustrated Murder. The accused appealed and later sought a new trial based on affidavits of retraction by the prosecution witnesses.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused were positively identified despite the alleged delay in naming them by the eyewitness.
2. W/N the defense of alibi can prosper against the prosecution's evidence.
3. W/N a new trial should be granted based on the witnesses' affidavits of retraction.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held there was no doubt regarding the witnesses' ability to identify the appellants. Jovita and Vargas were acquaintances of the accused and were only 2 to 7 meters away when the shooting started, with the scene illuminated by lamps and the rising moon [1]. Jovita's failure to name the assailants immediately was satisfactorily explained; she was wounded and prioritized saving her son, which was the "most natural thing for her to do" [2].

2. **NO.** The defense of alibi was weak and unconvincing. The witnesses corroborating the alibi were mostly police officers closely related to the accused [3]. Furthermore, the crime scene was only 2.5 kilometers from the municipal building, making it physically possible for the accused to commit the crime and return unnoticed. Alibi cannot prevail over positive, direct, and straightforward identification by eyewitnesses [3], [4].

3. **NO.** The Court ruled that affidavits wherein prosecution witnesses retract their previous testimony do not constitute newly discovered evidence. Even if considered, such retractions are unreliable and would not alter the result of the case given the weight of evidence adduced during the trial [5].

Decision AFFIRMED.
