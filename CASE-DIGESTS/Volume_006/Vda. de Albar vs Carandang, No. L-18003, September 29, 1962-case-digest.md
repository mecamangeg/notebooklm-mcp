I. CAPTION
ROSARIO GREY VDA. DE ALBAR and JOSE M. GREY v. JOSEFA FABIE DE CARANDANG and THE COURT OF APPEALS (Second Division), G.R. No. L-18003, September 29, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners (naked owners) and Respondent Carandang (usufructuary) were involved in a prior litigation regarding a property in Manila. The Supreme Court eventually rendered a final judgment affirming Carandang's usufruct and right to interest on war damage payments. During the execution of this judgment, Petitioners opposed Respondent's motion for payment, alleging that Respondent failed to pay real estate taxes for 1954-1959, causing the property to be sold at public auction. Petitioners claimed they had to repurchase the property and pay back taxes amounting to P3,495.00, thereby extinguishing the usufruct.

On July 2, 1960, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila issued a writ of execution but ordered the Sheriff to withhold the sum of P3,495.90 from the amount due to Respondent, directing that the disposition of said sum be threshed out in a separate incident. Respondent filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA), arguing the CFI order illegally modified a final judgment. The CA granted the petition and annulled the CFI orders. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the CA's jurisdiction.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction over the petition for certiorari.
2. W/N the CFI order withholding a portion of the judgment award constituted an illegal modification of a final and executory judgment.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction. Under Section 30 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, the CA's original jurisdiction to issue auxiliary writs (certiorari, prohibition, mandamus) is limited to cases "in aid of its appellate jurisdiction." This requirement is met only if the CA has jurisdiction to review the final decision in the principal case by appeal or writ of error. In this case, the principal action (Civil Case No. 17674) had already been finally decided by the Supreme Court and remanded for execution. There was no substantive issue left for the CA to review. Consequently, the CA had no appellate jurisdiction to aid. However, to save time and expense, the Supreme Court opted to resolve the petition on the merits as if originally filed with it.

2. **NO.** The CFI order did not modify the final judgment but merely authorized a stay of execution, which is permissible. While a final and executory decision is generally immutable (*Buenaventura v. Garcia*), a stay of execution may be granted "if necessary to accomplish the aims of justice, as for instance, where there has been a change in the situation of the parties which makes such execution inequitable" (*Chua Lee v. Mapa*; *Li Kim Tho v. Sanchez*). Petitioners' claim that they paid taxes and repurchased the property due to Respondent's negligence presented a *prima facie* case for reimbursement. Withholding the disputed amount pending resolution of this new issue was a valid exercise of the trial court's power to stay execution to prevent inequity.

The petition for certiorari filed by Respondent Carandang is DENIED.
