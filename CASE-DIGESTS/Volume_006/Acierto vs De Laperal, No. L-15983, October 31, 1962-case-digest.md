I. CAPTION
MAXIMO ACIERTO, GABRIEL ALEGRE, ET AL. v. VICTORINA G. DE LAPERAL, assisted by her husband ROBERTO LAPERAL, G.R. No. L-15983, October 31, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Acierto, et al. occupied portions of respondent De Laperal's land in Tondo, Manila, under verbal month-to-month lease contracts. In December 1958, petitioners sued in the Municipal Court to compel De Laperal to accept their monthly rentals. De Laperal refused the payments and prayed for ejectment, intending to construct a building on the property after giving petitioners notice to vacate.

The Municipal Court ordered petitioners to vacate and pay rentals. Petitioners appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI set the hearing for June 2, 1959. On May 29, 1959, petitioners' counsel filed a motion for postponement, alleging a conflict with a trial in Castillejos, Zambales. Neither petitioners nor their counsel appeared on the scheduled June 2 hearing. Consequently, the CFI denied the postponement and declared the appeal abandoned. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the postponement should have been granted.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court abused its discretion in denying the motion for postponement and declaring the appeal abandoned.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of the lower court. The Court held that the refusal to postpone was not an abuse of discretion, noting that the motion appeared to be a "mere dilatory expedient" to prolong the tenants' possession [1, 2].

The Court cited procedural defects in the motion: it was not under oath and lacked supporting papers to prove the alleged scheduled trial in Zambales [2]. Furthermore, the motion was not scheduled for submission prior to the trial date, and the petitioners erred in failing to appear on the assumption that the postponement would be granted [2].

On the merits, the Court observed that petitioners had no valid defense against ejectment. Since the leases were on a month-to-month basis, they expired at the end of every month under Article 1687 of the New Civil Code, without need for special demand [3]. The three-month notice to vacate given by respondents was deemed reasonable [3].

The appealed order is **AFFIRMED**.
