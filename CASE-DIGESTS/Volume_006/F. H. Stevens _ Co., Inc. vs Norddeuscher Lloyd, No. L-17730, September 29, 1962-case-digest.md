**I. CAPTION**
F. H. STEVENS & CO., INC. v. NORDDEUSCHER LLOYD, G.R. No. L-17730, September 29, 1962, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
On March 28, 1959, F.H. Stevens & Co. shipped 2,000 thermometers from Hamburg to Manila aboard the "MS Schwabenstein," a vessel owned by Norddeuscher Lloyd. The vessel arrived on May 15, 1959, and the plaintiff was notified of delivery on May 21, 1959 [1]. Upon inspection, 1,154 thermometers valued at $342.74 were missing or destroyed. The plaintiff filed an action for recovery in the Municipal Court of Manila on April 27, 1960 [1]. On June 13, 1960, the Municipal Court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, as it involved admiralty jurisdiction [1].

Consequently, on June 24, 1960, the plaintiff filed this action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [1]. The defendant moved to dismiss, arguing the action had prescribed under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), which sets a one-year limitation period from the date of delivery (May 21, 1959) [2]. The CFI granted the motion and dismissed the complaint. The plaintiff appealed, arguing the period was suspended by the first action or renewed upon its dismissal [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the action filed in the Court of First Instance has prescribed.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court reversed the order of dismissal. The Court held that the action is preserved by both Article 1155 of the Civil Code and Section 49 of Act No. 190 (Code of Civil Procedure) [3].

Article 1155 provides that the prescription of actions is interrupted when they are filed before the court [3]. Furthermore, Section 49 of Act No. 190 states that if an action is commenced in due time and the plaintiff fails "otherwise than upon the merits" (such as dismissal for lack of jurisdiction), and the time limit has expired at the date of such failure, the plaintiff may commence a new action within one year after such date [3].

Here, the first action in the Municipal Court was commenced on April 27, 1960, within the one-year COGSA period running from May 21, 1959. It was dismissed on June 13, 1960, which was *after* the original one-year period had expired [4]. Therefore, under Section 49 of Act No. 190, the period to bring a new action was renewed for another year starting June 14, 1960 [4]. Since the CFI action was filed on June 24, 1960, it was well within the legal period [5]. The Court distinguished this from cases where dismissal was due to voluntary desistance, and modified contrary rulings in *Chua Kuy v. Everest Steamship Corp.* and *Yek Tong Lin v. American President Lines* [5, 6].

The order appealed from is **REVERSED** and the case remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [6].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Labrador, J. concurred in the result [7].
