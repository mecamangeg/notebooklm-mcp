I. CAPTION
**IN RE: ORIGINAL CERTIFICATE OF TITLE NO. O-1385, PAULINO P. GOCHECO, CESARIO GOCHECO v. FRANCISCO T. ESTACIO, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-15183, October 30, 1962, Paredes, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Paulino P. Gocheco was the registered owner of a parcel of land in Zamboanga del Sur covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. O-1385. The owner's duplicate copy was lost, but the original certificate remained intact in the Register of Deeds. On January 18, 1957, Cesario Gocheco, Paulino's son and heir, filed a petition under Section 109 of Act No. 496 for the issuance of a new owner's duplicate copy [2, 3].

Francisco Estacio and others opposed the petition, claiming adverse possession of the property. The trial court suspended the hearing and ordered the petitioner to: (1) publish the petition; and (2) file testate or intestate proceedings to secure the appointment of a legal representative and a judicial declaration of heirs [3, 4]. When the petitioner failed to comply, the trial court dismissed the petition on September 9, 1957 [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the publication of the petition and the institution of estate proceedings are conditions precedent for the issuance of a lost owner’s duplicate title. [5]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that since the original certificate of title is intact in the Register of Deeds, the petition is not for reconstitution under Republic Act No. 26; thus, publication of the notice of hearing is not required [6].

Furthermore, the Court ruled that under Section 109 of Act No. 496, a "person in interest" may petition for the replacement of a lost duplicate certificate. As the petitioner is an heir and the petition does not seek the distribution of the decedent's estate, there is no need to first secure the appointment of a legal representative or a judicial declaration of heirs [6, 7]. The oppositors' claim of ownership based on adverse possession is immaterial to this proceeding and must be instituted in a separate ordinary civil action [8].

The order of the trial court is **SET ASIDE**, and the Register of Deeds is directed to issue a new owner's duplicate copy of OCT No. O-1385 to the petitioner [9].
