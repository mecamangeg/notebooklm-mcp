I. CAPTION
TE ENG LING v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17918, November 28, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Te Eng Ling, a citizen of Nationalist China born in Iloilo, filed a petition for naturalization [1]. He was employed at the Far Eastern Furniture and Hardware store, earning P4.00 a day with free laundry, board, and lodging, amounting to an average monthly income of P104.00 [1]. He did not own real estate worth at least P5,000.00 [2]. During his elementary, secondary, and college education, he enrolled under the names "Ramon L. Te" or "Ramon Te," but used the name "Te Eng Ling" in his published petition for naturalization [1, 3]. The Government opposed the petition on the grounds that he lacked a lucrative income and used unauthorized aliases [4]. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo granted the petition, prompting the Government to appeal [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner satisfies the requirement of having a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the petitioner’s use of different names is a ground to deny naturalization.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petitioner does not have a lucrative or gainful occupation. The Court held that a monthly income of P104.00, even with free board and lodging, is not considered lucrative considering the high cost of living and the low purchasing power of the peso [2, 5]. The Court relied on *Velasco v. Republic* and *Swee Din Tan v. Republic*, where even higher monthly incomes of P150.00 and P200.00, respectively, were deemed insufficient to meet the statutory requirement [5].

2. **YES.** The use of a name in the petition for naturalization different from the names used in public dealings (such as school records) is a ground for denial [3]. The Court reasoned that using a different name ("Te Eng Ling") in the petition than the one known to the public ("Ramon L. Te") serves no purpose other than to confuse and mislead the people, thereby facilitating the petition's approval by forestalling potential opposition [3].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** [6].
