I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SIMEON PAULIN, MATIAS POROC, GREGORIO BAGABOYBOY and MANUEL YONGCO, G.R. No. L-16491, November 29, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
The victim, Apolinario Tapayan, and accused Simeon Paulin had a long-standing land dispute regarding a homestead in Misamis Occidental [1]. On December 16, 1949, Paulin was heard conspiring to kill Tapayan [1]. On the evening of December 17, 1949, prosecution witness Narcisa Mahilawan heard gunshots and subsequently saw Paulin, Gregorio Bagaboyboy, Matias Poroc, and Manuel Yongco walking hurriedly away from the scene, armed with a shotgun and carbine [2]. She found Tapayan dead with multiple gunshot wounds [2]. The accused interposed the defense of alibi, claiming they were in other towns playing mahjong or attending to domestic matters [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance convicted them of Murder but sentenced them to only twenty (20) years of *reclusion temporal* [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over the positive identification by prosecution witnesses.
2. W/N the penalty of *reclusion temporal* imposed by the lower court is correct.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The defense of alibi invoked by the accused cannot prevail over the positive identification of them by the prosecution witnesses [6, 7]. The Court found the witnesses' identification of the accused leaving the crime scene to be credible and corroborated by ballistic evidence linking the recovered firearms to the victim's wounds [8]. The alibis were deemed insufficient to overcome this positive identification [7].

2. **NO.** The penalty imposed by the lower court was incorrect. Since the crime committed is Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code and there were no mitigating or aggravating circumstances attendant to the commission of the crime, the penalty must be imposed in its medium period [6]. The correct penalty is *reclusion perpetua*, not *reclusion temporal* [9].

**Judgment affirmed with modification**, sentencing the accused to *reclusion perpetua* [9].
