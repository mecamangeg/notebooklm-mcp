I. CAPTION
CONSUELO V. CALO, doing business under the name and style CVC LUMBER INDUSTRIES assisted by her husband, MARCOS M. CALO v. CRISANTO ARAGON, Municipal Judge, Branch IV, City of Manila, BENJAMIN B. PINEDA and ADOLFO B. BENAVIDES, G.R. No. L-19356, November 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Adolfo Benavides filed a complaint in the Municipal Court of Manila against Petitioners (the Calo spouses) for the recovery of P3,620.65 representing unpaid merchandise [1]. The Sheriff served the summons at a Quezon City address through an alleged niece of the petitioners [2]. Petitioners failed to answer, and on December 13, 1961, the trial court rendered a judgment by default [2, 3]. A writ of execution was issued on December 26, 1961 [4].

Petitioners received a copy of the decision on January 2, 1962 [3]. On January 5, 1962, they seasonably filed a petition for relief to set aside the decision, arguing invalid service of summons and a valid defense [5]. On January 10, 1962, they filed an urgent *ex parte* motion to set aside the execution order, noting the decision was not yet final [4]. The trial court ignored these petitions, and the Sheriff seized petitioners' car on January 11, 1962 [6]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus with the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in ignoring the petition for relief and enforcing the writ of execution.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court's actuation constituted a clear abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction [7]. The petitioners had seasonably filed a petition for relief and a motion to set aside the execution order after receiving the decision but before it became final [7]. By choosing to ignore these filings and proceeding with the execution and sale of the petitioners' property, the trial court deprived the petitioners of their day in court and the opportunity to be heard, which is essential to due process [7]. The Court cited *Martinez, et al. v. Villacete, et al.* and *Evens v. Workmen’s Compensation Commission* in support of this principle [7].

The writs prayed for were granted, and the case was remanded to the court *a quo* for further proceedings [8].
