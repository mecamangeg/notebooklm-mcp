I. CAPTION
JULIANA ZAPATA v. DIRECTOR OF LANDS, G.R. No. L-17645, October 30, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Juliana Zapata owns two parcels of land (Lot No. 25 and a portion of Lot No. 16) in Santo Tomas, Pampanga, which adjoin the Candalaga Creek [1]. When the cadastral survey began in 1915, the creek was about 90 to 100 meters wide, but strictly due to soil accumulation from the water current, it narrowed to 15 meters [2]. This accumulation formed three new lots (Lots 1, 2, and 3), which Zapata sought to register in her name under Article 457 of the Civil Code [2, 3]. The Director of Lands opposed the registration, arguing that the land should be part of the public domain because the accretion was not natural but artificially induced by fish traps (*salag net*, *bunuan*, and *sabat*) erected by fishermen in the creek [3-5]. The Court of First Instance of Pampanga ruled in favor of Zapata, ordering the registration of the lots [6]. The Director of Lands appealed, and the case was certified to the Supreme Court as it involved only questions of law [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accretion belongs to the riparian owner under Article 457 of the Civil Code despite the presence of fish traps that may have influenced the water current.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decree. Under Article 457 of the Civil Code, "to the owners of lands adjoining the banks of rivers belong the accretion which they gradually receive from the effects of the current of the waters" [4]. The Court held that while the fish traps might have slowed the current and contributed to the accretion, the riparian owner may still invoke the benefit of Article 457 provided there is no evidence that the erection of the traps was "expressly intended or designed to cause or bring about the accretion" [5]. The Court noted that the traps were erected by fishermen who held government permits and that the practice had ceased before 1926, indicating the accretion was not entirely or intentionally caused by the traps [5]. Since the accretion was formed gradually due to the water current, Zapata is the lawful owner. The decree appealed from is affirmed [7].
