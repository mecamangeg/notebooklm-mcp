I. CAPTION
AMANDA V. CABIGAO v. AMADO DEL ROSARIO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18379, October 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Amanda V. Cabigao was found guilty of gross negligence in the performance of official duty by the Commissioner of Civil Service on November 16, 1959, and was considered resigned effective her last day of duty with pay [1]. She appealed the decision to the Civil Service Board of Appeals and requested reinstatement pending appeal, arguing that the decision was not yet final and executory [1, 2]. Her request was denied by the Secretary of Finance [1].

Cabigao filed a petition for mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, praying for immediate reinstatement pending her administrative appeal [3]. The CFI ruled in her favor, ordering the respondents to reinstate her immediately to the Bureau of Customs to perform clerical duties pending the decision of the Civil Service Board of Appeals [4, 5]. The respondents, including the Commissioner of Civil Service, appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Commissioner of Civil Service may enforce a decision removing an employee pending the employee's appeal to the Civil Service Board of Appeals.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the Commissioner of Civil Service has the discretion to enforce his decision and make it effective pending appeal to protect public interest [6].

While Section 36 of Republic Act No. 2260 (Civil Service Act of 1959) makes the Commissioner's decision appealable to the Civil Service Board of Appeals, it does not explicitly stay the execution of the decision [7]. The Court drew an analogy to civil actions involving purely private rights, where a decision may be executed pending appeal for special reasons; thus, there is no valid reason not to follow this rule in actions involving public interest [8].

The Court clarified its previous ruling in *Tan v. Jimenez*, stating that while an appeal precludes a decision from becoming "final and executory" in the sense of being immutable, it does not necessarily prevent execution pending appeal [8]. If the Civil Service Board of Appeals reverses the decision, the employee is protected by Section 35 of the Civil Service Act of 1959, which provides for restoration to the position with full pay for the period of suspension/removal [6, 9].

Consequently, the writ of mandamus should have been denied as Cabigao had no clear legal right to reinstatement pending appeal [10].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision appealed from is reversed, and the petition for mandamus filed by appellee against appellants is dismissed, with costs.
