I. CAPTION
DR. ERNESTO A. BELEN v. DR. CONRADO M. DE LEON, G.R. No. L-16412, November 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellee Dr. Ernesto A. Belen obtained a final executory judgment against defendant-appellant Dr. Conrado M. de Leon, a dentist, for the sum of P1,360.10 [1]. A writ of execution was issued, and the sheriff levied upon De Leon's properties, specifically a Japanese dental unit and a Westinghouse electric floor fan, to be sold at public auction [1]. De Leon filed a motion claiming these items were exempt from execution under the Rules of Court as "tools and implements necessarily used by him in the practice of his profession" [2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled that the dental unit was exempt but declared the electric floor fan subject to execution [2]. De Leon appealed this ruling regarding the fan [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an electric floor fan used by a dentist in his clinic is exempt from execution as a necessary tool or implement. [1]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the electric floor fan is exempt. The Court applied the principle that statutes and rules providing for exemption from execution should be liberally construed to effectuate their beneficent and humane purpose, with reasonable doubts resolved in favor of the debtor [3]. The term "implement" is broad enough to include articles of furniture used to equip a place [3]. Taking judicial notice that most dental clinics are not spacious or air-conditioned, and that dental work is delicate and often unpleasant for the patient, the Court found the fan to be a "necessary implement" for the appellant's practice [3], [4].

Accordingly, the lower court's decision was **MODIFIED** to include the electric floor fan among the articles exempt from execution [4].
