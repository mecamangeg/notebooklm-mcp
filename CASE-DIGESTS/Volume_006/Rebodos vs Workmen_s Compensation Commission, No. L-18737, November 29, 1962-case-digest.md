I. CAPTION
FLORENCIO REBODOS v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and BENGUET CONSOLIDATED, INC., G.R. No. L-18737, November 29, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rebodos worked for respondent Benguet Consolidated, Inc. from 1948 to 1958, starting as a mucker and eventually becoming a *capataz* (supervisor). He contracted pulmonary tuberculosis in 1950, but it remained inactive/arrested while he continued working. In 1957, X-rays showed new lesions, leading to his separation from service in 1958. He filed a claim for compensation.

The Hearing Officer ruled in Rebodos's favor. However, the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed the decision, absolving the company. The WCC found that Rebodos's work as a *capataz* was less strenuous than his previous roles, yet his illness progressed. The WCC attributed the aggravation to "factors extraneous to employment," specifically Rebodos's gambling activities which caused him to stay up late and lack sleep. Rebodos appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner’s illness is compensable.
2. W/N the issue of the respondent's failure to controvert the claim can be raised for the first time on appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court affirmed the WCC's findings, holding that factual findings supported by substantial evidence are binding on the Supreme Court. While Rebodos contracted TB during employment, the disease had been arrested. Its subsequent aggravation was not caused by his work—which had become lighter as a supervisor—but by "personal dissipation" and factors attributable to his own fault, specifically lack of sleep due to gambling. Consequently, the illness is not compensable [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner failed to raise the issue of non-controversion before the Hearing Officer or the Workmen’s Compensation Commission. Issues not raised in the lower proceedings cannot be raised for the first time on appeal [3].

The decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is **AFFIRMED**.
