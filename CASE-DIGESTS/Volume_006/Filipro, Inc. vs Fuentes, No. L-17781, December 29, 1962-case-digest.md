I. CAPTION
FILIPRO, INC. and HILARION TANTOCO BROKERAGE, INCORPORATED v. F. A. FUENTES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17781, December 29, 1962, Paredes, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On March 24, 1958, thirty-one persons claiming to be former employees of petitioners Filipro, Inc. and Hilarion Tantoco Brokerage filed a claim for separation pay amounting to P14,215.50 with Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor [2]. They alleged they were dismissed without just cause and notice on February 17, 1958 [2]. Before the scheduled hearing, petitioners filed a Petition for Prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, arguing that the Regional Office officials lacked valid authority to exercise judicial functions over money claims [2, 3]. Petitioners contended that Republic Act No. 997 did not authorize the Reorganization Commission to confer such powers via Reorganization Plan No. 20-A [3]. The CFI granted the writ of prohibition, ruling that the Regional Offices were not legally created to hear the complaint and ordered the labor officials to desist from further proceedings [4]. Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Section 25 of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A validly grants Regional Offices of the Department of Labor jurisdiction over money claims of laborers [6, 7].

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, declaring that Section 25 of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, which grants regional offices original and exclusive jurisdiction over money claims of laborers, is null and void [7, 8]. The Court reasoned that this grant of jurisdiction was made without authority under Republic Act No. 997 [7]. Citing *Corominas, Jr. v. Labor Standards Commission*, the Court held that the Legislature did not intend to authorize the transfer of jurisdiction from courts of justice to officials appointed by the Reorganization Plan [5, 7]. Furthermore, the Legislature cannot delegate its power to create courts of justice to the Reorganization Commission, an executive agency [5].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [9].
