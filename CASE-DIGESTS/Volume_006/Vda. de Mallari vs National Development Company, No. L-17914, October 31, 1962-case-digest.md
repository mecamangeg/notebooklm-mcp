I. CAPTION
ROSARIO MARTIN VDA. DE MALLARI v. NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, G.R. No. L-17914, October 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rosario Martin Vda. de Mallari is the mother of the late Milagros Mallari, who was employed as a weaver by respondent National Development Company since 1938. In March 1951, due to the nature of her work, Milagros spat blood and developed pulmonary tuberculosis, forcing her to retire on September 17, 1951. She eventually died of the disease on July 12, 1953 [1, 2].

On June 13, 1960, petitioner initially filed a claim with the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) but withdrew it. On August 30, 1960, she filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to recover death compensation under Article 1711 of the New Civil Code. She argued that the WCC lacked jurisdiction because her daughter died more than one year after contracting the disease [1, 2]. The CFI dismissed the complaint on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a cause of action [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the claim for death compensation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the claim falls within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission.

Under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 772, which amended the Workmen’s Compensation Act and took effect on June 20, 1952, the employer is liable for compensation if the disease or injury causes death within **two years** from the date of such sickness or injury [4, 5]. Here, Milagros contracted the disease in September 1951 and died on July 12, 1953, which is clearly within the statutory two-year period [6].

Furthermore, Section 24 of Republic Act No. 772 grants the WCC Commissioner exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide claims for compensation under the Act. Jurisprudence establishes that all claims filed on or after June 20, 1952, are to be decided exclusively by the WCC, even if the accident giving rise to the right occurred before that date (*Carmen Castro v. Sagaris*; *Teresita Capulong v. L.V.N. Pictures, Inc.*) [3, 7, 8]. It is the evident intention of Congress that all claims for damages due to work-related accidents be adjudicated by the WCC (*Manalo v. Foster Wheeler Corp.*) [6].

The Order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED**, without prejudice to the filing of a claim by appellant with the Workmen’s Compensation Commission [9].
