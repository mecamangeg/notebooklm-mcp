I. CAPTION
MARIANO GARCHITORENA v. HON. TOMAS P. PANGANIBAN, EMILIO ERASGA, et al., G.R. No. L-17784, October 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Mariano Garchitorena owns a 138-hectare farm in Ocampo, Camarines Sur, of which approximately 77 hectares were occupied by the 34 private respondents as tenants. On May 9, 1956, Garchitorena filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) to transfer the respondents to other lots or eject them. He intended to convert the land from palay to pasture land, arguing it was suitable for grazing, and alleging that the respondents failed to pay rentals and observe proven farm practices [1].

The CAR denied the petition, ruling that the land was not proven to be suitable for grazing. It also held that the respondents' failure to pay rentals was not deliberate but caused by poor harvests, and noted that the rental rates might be excessive and illegal [2]. Garchitorena appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the land is suitable for conversion from agricultural to pasture land.
2. W/N the tenants' failure to pay rentals due to the land's continuously poor yield justifies their ejectment or transfer.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The evidence, including a report from the Bureau of Soil Conservation and corroborated testimony, established that the land is stony, has rock outcrops, and suffers from low fertility due to soil erosion [3]. Since the land can hardly yield 3 to 5 cavanes of palay per hectare, the Court found it appropriate for grazing purposes rather than crops [3].

2. **YES.** While a failure to pay rentals might be excusable if due to an *extraordinary* event or act of God, it is not justified when the omission persists for *several* years because the land *normally* has a poor yield [4]. To rule otherwise would allow tenants to hold the land indefinitely without sharing the produce, virtually depriving the landowner of the enjoyment of possession and use of his property in violation of the Constitution [4]. The Court emphasized that the principle of social justice cannot be construed to violate elementary principles of justice or to perpetuate the tenants' poverty on unproductive land [5]. Furthermore, even if the rental rate were excessive, it does not justify the non-payment of *any* rental whatsoever [6].

The judgment of the CAR is **REVERSED**. The petitioner is authorized to convert the land into pasture land, and the record is remanded to the lower court to determine the feasibility of transferring the respondents to other suitable agricultural portions of the petitioner's land [6].
