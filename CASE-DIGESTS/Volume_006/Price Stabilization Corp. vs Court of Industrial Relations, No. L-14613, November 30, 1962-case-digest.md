I. CAPTION
PRICE STABILIZATION CORPORATION v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and PRISCO WORKERS’ UNION, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14613, November 30, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On March 18, 1953, the PRISCO Workers’ Union and 58 security guards filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) making various demands, including overtime and holiday pay [1]. The CIR rendered a partial decision on August 25, 1953, granting claims from June 1951 onwards, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-9288 [2, 3]. Subsequently, on June 10, 1955, the CIR rendered a decision granting the remaining demands covering the period from August 1946 to June 1951, which was also affirmed by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-9834 [4].

After the decision in G.R. No. L-9834 became final, the Union filed a motion to include 522 other workers of PRISCO to receive the benefits of the award [5]. The CIR granted the motion. PRISCO appealed, arguing that the motion constituted a new and independent action filed in 1958. Consequently, PRISCO contended that under Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act), the CIR had lost jurisdiction over money claims, and under Republic Act No. 1993, the claims were barred by the three-year prescriptive period [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR has jurisdiction to extend the benefits of its decision to other workers upon a motion filed after the decision became final.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's order. The Court held that the motion to include the 522 other workers was merely an incident of the main case (Case No. 840-V) originally filed on March 18, 1953 [7, 8]. Since the main case was filed prior to the effectivity of Republic Act No. 875 (June 17, 1953) and Republic Act No. 1993 (June 22, 1957), the limitations and jurisdictional restrictions of these laws do not apply [6, 8].

Under Sections 7 and 17 of Commonwealth Act No. 103, the CIR has broad powers to correct, amend, or modify its decisions and maintains continuing control over the case to accord substantial justice [9]. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Land Settlement & Development Corp. v. Caledonia Pile Workers’ Union* and *Parsons Hardware Co., Inc. v. Court of Industrial Relations*, holding that benefits won in a labor dispute should extend to other employees to avoid unjust discrimination against non-members [10, 11]. Thus, the order of June 4, 1958, and the resolution of October 13, 1958, of the Court of Industrial Relations are affirmed [12].
