I. CAPTION
DOMINGO Z. VILLACARLOS v. HON. JOSE B. JIMENEZ, THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF TERNATE, CAVITE, and BAYANI CATAMISAN, G.R. No. L-16437, December 29, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Villacarlos and respondent Catamisan were candidates for Mayor of Ternate, Cavite in the November 10, 1959 elections [1]. On November 21, 1959, Villacarlos filed a petition for recounting of ballots in three precincts with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cavite, presided by respondent Judge Jimenez, alleging discrepancies between the election returns and the certificates of election results issued to watchers under Sections 163 and 168 of the Revised Election Code [1]. The CFI issued a preliminary injunction restraining the proclamation of the winner [1].

Catamisan opposed the petition, alleging the certificates were not authentic and that the ballot boxes had been tampered with [2]. The CFI allowed Catamisan to introduce evidence of tampering over Villacarlos’ objection that the court's jurisdiction was limited to a ministerial recount and did not extend to election anomalies [2, 3]. Villacarlos filed the instant petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court to annul the CFI's rulings allowing such evidence [3].

However, before the Supreme Court's writ of preliminary injunction could be served, the CFI dismissed the main petition for recount based on the Supreme Court's decision in *Parlade v. Quicho* (G.R. No. L-16259), and Catamisan was subsequently proclaimed mayor [3]. The parties admitted the issue became moot but Villacarlos urged the Court to decide the case on the merits as a guide for future litigations [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court should decide the petition on the merits despite the issue becoming moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court declined to decide the case on the merits. The Court held that the reason advanced by the petitioner—to serve as a guide for future litigations—was "not weighty enough to justify a disregard of the established general rule that moot issues, which affect no rights of the parties, are not proper for adjudication by the courts" [3-5].

Furthermore, the Court noted that the substantive question had already been settled by *Parlade v. Quicho*. The discrepancy justifying a recount under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code refers to discrepancies "appearing in different copies of the election returns required by section 150, and not to the discrepancy between the election returns and any certificate given by the board of inspectors to the watchers" [3, 6, 7]. Since the main case was dismissed by the lower court and the respondent proclaimed, the petition is dismissed [3, 8].
