I. CAPTION
JUANITA NAIRA v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and COMPANIA GENERAL DE TABACOS DE FILIPINAS, G.R. No. L-18066, October 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Juan Naira worked for respondent Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas for 26 years, eventually as a barge pilot. On November 12, 1958, he helped load heavy barrels of cotton seeds and fertilizers onto a barge until 1:30 p.m. Shortly after going home for lunch, he complained of intense stomach pain and was hospitalized. He died the next day, November 13, 1958. The autopsy identified the cause of death as acute mesenteric thrombosis [1].

Petitioner Juanita Naira, his widow, filed a claim for compensation. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) denied the claim, ruling that there was no evidence linking the illness (acute mesenteric thrombosis) to the nature of his employment. The WCC held that the claimant failed to prove the ailment was directly caused or aggravated by his work [2]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the death of the employee caused by acute mesenteric thrombosis is compensable despite the absence of direct evidence linking the illness to his employment.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the WCC's decision. The Court held that the WCC erred in ignoring the presumption established in **Section 43(1) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act (Act No. 3428, as amended)**.

The law presumes that a claim is compensable in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary. When an injury or death supervenes in the course of employment, the burden is on the employer to clearly establish that it was *not* caused or aggravated by the employment [3, 4]. Mere absence of evidence traceable to the employment is insufficient to reject the claim; there must be a credible showing by the employer that it was *not* traceable [4]. Furthermore, the fact that the illness followed closely after the deceased's physical exertion in loading the barge supported the inference that the condition was precipitated by strain [4].

The decision was reversed and remanded to the WCC for the determination of the compensation amount [5].
