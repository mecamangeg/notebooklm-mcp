I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JOSE REPATO and FELICIANO NATAD, G.R. No. L-17892, September 29, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of August 31, 1960, a picnic was held at the house of Macario Vinluan in Pangasinan, attended by the accused Jose Repato and Feliciano Natad, and the deceased Prudencio Vallo, among others. When Vallo left the gathering, Repato remarked that the group should not consider Vallo as having been among them, and immediately followed him accompanied by Natad.

Eyewitness Crispin Vinluan followed the group and, from a distance of about 20 meters under bright moonlight, saw Repato fire a carbine at Vallo. After Vallo fell, Natad struck him with a stone. Minutes later, Repato and Natad returned to Macario’s house, admitted they had "killed Doding" (Vallo), and hid the carbine nearby. The carbine was later identified as one forcibly taken by the accused from a mine guard weeks earlier; ballistics tests matched it to the cartridges found at the crime scene.

Repato was charged with Murder. He raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was in Manila looking for work at the time. He further argued that the prosecution witnesses testified falsely due to a grudge stemming from his refusal to testify in a separate case involving acts of lasciviousness. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan convicted Repato of Murder and sentenced him to *reclusión perpetua*. Repato appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the prosecution witnesses' credibility and positive identification are sufficient to convict the accused despite his defense of alibi and alleged witness ill-will.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court ruled that the defense of alibi cannot overcome the positive testimony of an eyewitness who saw and identified the accused during the killing (*U.S. v. Buenco*). Repato's alibi was further dismantled by the testimony of his own cousin, who saw him in the vicinity on the night of the crime, and by the admission of his alibi witness that she could not account for his presence at all times.

Regarding the credibility of witnesses, the Court held that the alleged grudge—Repato's refusal to testify for a relative of the witness—even if true, was insufficient to prompt witnesses to concoct evidence and falsely implicate the appellant in a crime as grave as murder. Furthermore, inconsistencies in testimonies on minor points and the initial reluctance of witnesses to report the incident to authorities do not affect their credibility, as it is common for witnesses to be reluctant to get involved in criminal investigations (*People v. Villamin*).

Judgment affirmed.
