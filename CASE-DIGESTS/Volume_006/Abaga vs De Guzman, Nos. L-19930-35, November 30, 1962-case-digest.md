I. CAPTION
ESTANISLAO ABAGA, ALEJANDRO COSTA, et al. v. HON. PASTOR L. DE GUZMAN, RENE LICHAUCO, AMANDA VDA. DE LA CRUZ, et al., G.R. Nos. L-19930-35, November 30, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Lichaucos, landowners of Hacienda El Porvenir, filed six cases in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) against their tenants, including petitioners Abaga and Costa, for ejectment and collection of unpaid rentals [1]. The Land Tenure Administration intervened due to pending expropriation proceedings, which were later partially settled [1]. On March 29, 1962, respondent Judge De Guzman rendered a decision ordering the ejectment of tenants who failed to pay rentals and did not fall within the government-purchased portion of the estate [2].

Petitioners received the decision on April 12, 1962. They initially filed a notice of appeal but withdrew it to file a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied [3]. Petitioners then filed an original petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [4], [5]. However, they failed to file a brief or memorandum after the respondents submitted their answers [5]. The record involved a voluminous 304-page decision, but petitioners did not specify the errors of law or jurisdictional issues [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition should be dismissed for failure to file a brief or memorandum.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition. The Court noted that the petition was procedurally defective as an original action under Rule 67 for lacking necessary allegations [5]. Even if the Court were to treat the petition as an appeal by certiorari under Rule 44, it was incumbent upon the petitioners to file their brief or memorandum within 10 days from receipt of the respondents' answers [5]. Petitioners failed to comply with this requirement [5].

The Court emphasized that the formulation of issues devolves upon the petitioners [6]. Without a brief specifying errors of law or grave abuse of discretion, the Court cannot be expected to wade through a voluminous record to search for points where the respondent Judge may have erred [5], [6]. Consequently, for failure to file a brief or memorandum within the prescribed period, the petition was dismissed [7].
