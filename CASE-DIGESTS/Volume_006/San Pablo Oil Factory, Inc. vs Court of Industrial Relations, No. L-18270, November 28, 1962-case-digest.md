I. CAPTION
SAN PABLO OIL FACTORY, INC. and WERNER P. SCHETELIG v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and KAPATIRANG MANGGAGAWA ASSOCIATION (NLU), G.R. No. L-18270, November 28, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On May 27, 1957, following failed negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement renewal, San Pablo Oil Factory, Inc. (Company) declared a lockout against members of the Kapatirang Manggagawa Association (Union) [1]. The Union filed a complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP) with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), praying for return to work and back wages [2, 3].

On October 29, 1958, the CIR *en banc* issued a resolution finding the Company guilty of ULP [3, 4]. However, this resolution did not expressly award back wages [5]. The Company appealed to the Supreme Court, but the appeal was dismissed, rendering the CIR resolution final and executory [4]. More than eight months later, the Union filed a motion praying for back wages based on the ULP finding [4]. On March 15, 1961, the CIR issued a new resolution modifying its previous decision to award back wages [6]. The Company appealed, questioning the CIR's authority to alter a final judgment [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR has the authority to modify a final and executory decision to award back wages which were not granted in the original decision.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the CIR acted in excess of its jurisdiction.

While Section 15 of Republic Act No. 875 entitles workers to back wages upon a finding of illegal lockout, this relief is not presumed; it must be expressly made in the decision [5]. Furthermore, although Section 17 of Commonwealth Act No. 103 authorizes the CIR to modify its awards, this power does not extend to reopening issues already passed upon or substantially altering a decision after it has become final and executory [5].

The Court cited *Pepsi Cola v. Philippine Labor Organization*, holding that proceedings may only be reopened on grounds coming into existence *after* the order was rendered, not upon grounds available during the former proceedings [7]. Since the Union failed to move for reconsideration or appeal the original decision's silence on back wages, that decision became final [5, 8]. The Court distinguished this from *Luzon Brokerage v. Luzon Labor Union*, where back wages were awarded in the original decision and the subsequent order merely implemented the computation [9]. Here, there was no award to implement [8].

The resolution appealed from is **REVERSED** [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Paredes, Regala, and Makalintal concurred [10]. Chief Justice Bengzon took no part [10].
