I. CAPTION
FRANCISCA GATCHALIAN v. GORGONIO PAVILIN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17619, October 31, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Francisca Gatchalian filed a complaint for recovery of ownership and possession against defendants Gorgonio Pavilin, et al., claiming she owned a 143-hectare tract of land in Isabela covered by Original Certificate of Title No. P-31 (Sales Patent No. V-33). She alleged that in 1953, the defendants unlawfully entered 36 hectares of Lot No. 2 of said land by force and stealth.

In their answer, defendants denied the allegations and interposed "Affirmative and Alternative Defenses": (1) that their landholdings lay outside the plaintiff's title; and (2) that if their holdings were covered by the title, said title was void *ab initio* because the land was still forest land when the sales patent was issued to plaintiff. Defendants claimed prior possession and cultivation in good faith, having filed homestead applications after the land was released by the Bureau of Forestry in 1954.

Upon plaintiff's motion, the Court of First Instance of Isabela declared that there was no genuine issue of fact regarding the title. It rendered a summary judgment declaring plaintiff the owner and ordering defendants to vacate, followed by a supplementary decision awarding damages. Defendants appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in rendering a summary judgment on the ground that there was no genuine issue of fact.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court annulled the summary judgment, holding that the defendants' pleadings raised genuine issues of fact that required a trial.

The Court reasoned that Rule 15, Section 9 of the Rules of Court specifically authorizes the pleading of alternative defenses, even if inconsistent with each other, provided each is consistent in itself [1]. The defendants raised two main factual issues: the exact location of the lands (whether they overlapped) and the nature of the land when the patent was issued (whether it was forest land) [1].

Summary judgment is improper when there is a controversy upon any question of fact; it is only authorized if it clearly appears that there is no genuine issue of material fact [2], [3]. In this case, a trial was indispensable to delimit the exact areas covered by the plaintiff's title and those occupied by the defendants [4]. Questions of law should be resolved after, not before, these questions of fact are litigated [5].

Furthermore, the Court rejected the argument that defendants lacked personality to assail the plaintiff's title. By reason of prior occupancy and cultivation, they acquired possessory rights which they may vindicate against intruders without better title [4]. If the land was indeed forest land when granted, the patent would be void *ab initio* and subject to attack (Civil Code, Arts. 1409, 1421) [4].

**The decisions were ANNULLED and SET ASIDE, and the records were REMANDED to the lower court for trial on the merits.**
