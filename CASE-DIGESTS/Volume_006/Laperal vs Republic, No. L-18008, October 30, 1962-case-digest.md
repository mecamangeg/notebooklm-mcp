I. CAPTION
ELISEA LAPERAL v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18008, October 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Elisea Laperal married Enrique R. Santamaria in 1939. In 1958, a decree of legal separation was issued between them. In 1960, Elisea filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Baguio to resume using her maiden name, citing the legal separation and the fact that she had ceased living with her husband. The City Attorney opposed the petition, arguing it violated Article 372 of the Civil Code. The CFI initially denied the petition but, upon a motion for reconsideration, granted it. The trial court treated the petition as one for a change of name under Rule 103, reasoning that her continued use of the married name would cause confusion in her business interests and finances. The Republic appealed the decision.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a married woman legally separated from her husband may resume using her maiden name.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the language of Article 372 of the Civil Code is mandatory: "When legal separation has been granted, the wife *shall continue* using her name and surname employed before the legal separation." Legal separation does not sever the *vinculum* of marriage; thus, the woman's married status remains unaffected [1]. Consequently, she must continue using the name indicative of her unchanged status.

The Court further ruled that it is doubtful whether Rule 103 of the Rules of Court, which covers name changes in general, can prevail over the specific mandatory provisions of Article 372 regarding legally separated women. Even applying Rule 103, legal separation *alone* is not a sufficient ground to justify a name change, as this would circumvent the Civil Code [2]. The lower court's reasoning regarding financial confusion was baseless because, under Article 106(2) of the Civil Code, the conjugal partnership is automatically dissolved and liquidated upon the issuance of the decree of legal separation [3].

The order of the lower court was set aside and the petition was dismissed [4].
