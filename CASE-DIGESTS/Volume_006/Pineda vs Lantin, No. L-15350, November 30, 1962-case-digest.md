**I. CAPTION**
MARIANO G. PINEDA, ARCADIO E. YABYABIN, and MAXIMINO PIZARRO v. HON. GREGORIO T. LANTIN, BACOLOD-MURCIA MILLING CO., INC. and J. AMADO ARANETA, G.R. No. L-15350, November 30, 1962, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
Minority stockholders of Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co., Inc. filed a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the corporation and its president, J. Amado Araneta, for alleged violations of the Corporation Law [1]. SEC Commissioner Mariano Pineda ordered an investigation and designated petitioners Yabyabin and Pizarro as investigators, who subsequently issued a *subpoena duces tecum* to Araneta [1, 2]. Araneta moved to quash the subpoena, arguing the SEC could not investigate without first promulgating rules required by Republic Act No. 1143 [2, 3]. The SEC denied the motion [3]. Consequently, Araneta and the corporation filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, presided by Judge Lantin, to stop the investigation [4]. The SEC officers moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the CFI lacked jurisdiction to review SEC orders, but Judge Lantin denied the motion [5, 6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to issue an injunction against the Securities and Exchange Commission or review its orders.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that the power to grant injunctive relief against the SEC and review its orders is lodged exclusively with the Supreme Court [7]. Under Section 1, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court and Section 35 of Commonwealth Act No. 83 (The Securities Act), any party aggrieved by an order or ruling of the SEC must file a petition for review with the Supreme Court [8, 9]. The respondents' argument that the SEC order was merely interlocutory and thus not appealable to the Supreme Court was rejected; the Court cited *San Beda v. Court of Industrial Relations*, ruling that interlocutory orders are appealable when grounded on lack of jurisdiction [10]. To allow Courts of First Instance to enjoin the SEC would impede the Commission's function of overseeing corporate enterprises essential to the national economy [11].

The order of the lower court denying the motion to dismiss is **SET ASIDE** and the respondents are prohibited from proceeding with the civil case [12].
