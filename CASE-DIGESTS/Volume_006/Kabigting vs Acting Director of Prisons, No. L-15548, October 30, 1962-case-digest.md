I. CAPTION
**JOSE KABIGTING v. THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF PRISONS**, G.R. No. L-15548, October 30, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jose Kabigting had been serving prison terms for nineteen criminal convictions since 1938. He filed a third petition for *habeas corpus* (Sp. Proc. No. 3100) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, claiming he had served his sentence. Previously, his second petition was denied by the Supreme Court in *Kabigting v. Director of Prisons* (G.R. No. L-12276) on August 26, 1958, which established he still had an unserved balance of over 9 years. Despite the Supreme Court's final judgment and a resolution returning the records to the lower court with a warning against rehashing settled issues, the CFI (Judge Muñoz-Palma) disregarded the prior ruling. The CFI granted the third petition on April 25, 1959 (a Saturday) and ordered Kabigting's release. The Respondent Acting Director of Prisons received the decision at 12:25 PM that Saturday and filed a notice of appeal on the following Monday, April 27, at 9:45 AM.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Respondent's appeal was perfected within the reglementary period.
2. W/N the lower court had the authority to grant the petition contrary to the Supreme Court's final judgment in a prior case.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The appeal was timely. Section 18 of Rule 41 (of the then Rules of Court) required appeals in *habeas corpus* cases to be perfected within 24 hours (now 48 hours) from notice. However, Section 1 of Rule 28 provides that in computing time, the day of the act is excluded, and if the last day falls on a Sunday or legal holiday, the time runs until the next business day [1]. Since the Respondent received the decision on a Saturday afternoon and the next day was a Sunday, the 24-hour period did not expire until the following Monday [2]. Furthermore, the petitioner's immediate release was premature under Section 20 of Rule 41, which stays a judgment of release when an officer takes an appeal [2].

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court is the final arbiter of all legal questions properly brought before it, and its decision constitutes the *law of the case* [3]. Once a judgment becomes final, it is binding on all inferior courts and is beyond their power to alter or modify [3]. The lower court's issuance of the writ on the same grounds already settled in G.R. No. L-12276 was unjustified and disregarded the hierarchy of courts [3].

The decision appealed from is **SET ASIDE**, and the orders for the petitioner's recommitment are **AFFIRMED**.
