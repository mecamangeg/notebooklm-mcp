I. CAPTION
EMMA R. GENIZA, AURELIO GENIZA, LORENZO RIVERA, CATALINA CARREON RIVERA and ZACARIAS RIVERA v. HENRY SY and ASIA MERCANTILE CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-17165, September 26, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On July 8, 1959, Catalina Carreon and her husband Zacarias Rivera mortgaged a lot to Asia Mercantile Corporation to secure a loan of P50,000.00, payable within thirty days with 12% interest per annum [1]. The mortgage contract stipulated that in case of foreclosure, the mortgagor would pay 30% of the unpaid sum as attorney’s fees and liquidated damages [1]. Similar mortgages involving plaintiffs Emma and Aurelio Geniza were also executed [2]. Following the foreclosure of these mortgages, the plaintiffs filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon City to declare the 30% stipulation excessive, unconscionable, and iniquitous, seeking its reduction to P200.00 [3]. The CFI rendered a judgment reducing the 30% attorney’s fees and liquidated damages to 5% and ordered the defendants to return the excess proceeds from the foreclosure sales based on this reduction [4, 5]. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the stipulation should be declared usurious and that the fees should be further reduced [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the stipulation of 30% attorney’s fees and liquidated damages constitutes a usurious transaction.
2. W/N the lower court’s reduction of the attorney’s fees and liquidated damages from 30% to 5% was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the stipulation is not usurious per se [6]. There was no allegation of fact or evidence proving that the mortgagee's intention in inserting the provision was to exact a usurious interest, nor was there a claim that the mortgage was *contra bonos mores* [5, 6]. Consequently, the Court could not sustain the appellants' claim that the agreement was usurious simply because of the iniquitous clause [5].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that while the stipulation was not usurious, it was iniquitous and subject to reduction [5]. Considering the loans were only for a period of thirty days, a charge of 30% as damages is iniquitous [5]. The Court sustained the trial court’s discretion in reducing the rate to 5% as fair, in accordance with Articles 1227 and 1229 of the Civil Code, which allow for the equitable reduction of penalty clauses [5, 6].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [7].
