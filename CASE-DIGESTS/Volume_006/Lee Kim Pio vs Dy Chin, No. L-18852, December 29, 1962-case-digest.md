I. CAPTION
**LEE KIM PIO v. FRANCISCO DY CHIN and HON. GREGORIO T. LANTIN, G.R. No. L-18852, December 29, 1962, Barrera, J.**

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lee Kim Pio obtained a final judgment against Respondent Francisco Dy Chin in a civil case, where the Court of Appeals ordered Dy Chin to deliver 8.333 shares of stock of Mariano Uy Chaco Sons & Co., Inc. (or its value of P8,333.33), plus interest and attorney's fees [1, 2]. Upon issuance of the writ of execution, Dy Chin executed a "Deed of Assignment" conveying the shares to Lee Kim Pio [2, 3]. This deed and the payment for interest and fees were received and signed for by Lee Kim Pio's counsel of record, Atty. Jose C. Magat [4].

Later, Lee Kim Pio (through new counsel) moved to declare Dy Chin in contempt, alleging the judgment was unsatisfied because Lee Kim Pio did not sign or consent to the Deed of Assignment and never received the shares [5]. The Sheriff returned the writ unsatisfied, noting Dy Chin's refusal to deliver the shares [5]. The trial court denied the motion for contempt, ruling that Dy Chin had complied by delivering the deed and payment to petitioner's counsel, which equates to delivery to the petitioner [6]. Lee Kim Pio then moved for the issuance of an *alias* writ of execution, which the trial court also denied [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Deed of Assignment is null and void because the petitioner did not sign or consent to it.
2. W/N the issuance of an *alias* writ of execution is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the Deed of Assignment is valid even without the petitioner's signature or consent. The assignment is not a bilateral contract requiring mutual consent, but an instrument executed in compliance with a final judgment ordering the transfer of shares [9]. Furthermore, the transfer of shares via the deed and the payment of money to the petitioner's attorney of record constitute valid delivery and payment to the petitioner himself [9]. The petitioner's remedy is to demand the deed and money from his former lawyer [9].

2. **YES.** While the Deed of Assignment legally transferred the shares, the judgment specifically ordered the delivery of "Stock Certificate No. 280" from which the adjudicated shares would be taken [10]. The Sheriff's return indicated a refusal to deliver "shares of stock" generally, but did not specify if a demand was made for the specific stock certificate [10]. Since the certificate itself must be delivered to fully satisfy the judgment, the respondent may be compelled to do so [10].

**The order denying the petition for contempt is AFFIRMED, but the order denying the *alias* writ is SET ASIDE. The lower court is directed to issue an *alias* writ of execution only for the delivery of Stock Certificate No. 280 [11].**
