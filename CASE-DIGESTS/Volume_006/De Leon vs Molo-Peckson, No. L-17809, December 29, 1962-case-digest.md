I. CAPTION
RESURRECCION DE LEON, ET AL. v. EMILIANA MOLO-PECKSON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17809, December 29, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Mariano Molo and Juana Juan were the original owners of the subject properties. After Mariano's death, Juana Juan executed a donation *inter vivos* in 1948 in favor of respondents Emiliana Molo-Peckson and Pilar Perez Nable, covering almost all her properties, including ten parcels of land in Pasay City. Juana died in 1950. On December 5, 1950, the respondents executed a document titled "Mutual Agreement," stating that in conformity with the verbal wish of the late spouses, the ten lots were to be sold to petitioners Justa and Resurreccion de Leon for P1.00 each [1, 2].

On August 9, 1956, respondents executed a document revoking the "Mutual Agreement," claiming it did not represent the true verbal wishes of the donors [3]. Petitioners demanded conveyance of the properties, which respondents refused. The Court of First Instance of Rizal ruled in favor of petitioners, finding that a trust had been constituted [4]. Respondents appealed, arguing that no trust was created and, if one was, it had been revoked [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a valid express trust was created in favor of the petitioners.
2. W/N the respondents could validly revoke the trust.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the "Mutual Agreement" executed by the respondents constituted a recognition of a pre-existing trust or a declaration of an express trust [6]. While the Civil Code of 1889 (which governed the trust created prior to the New Civil Code) did not contain specific trust provisions, the Court applied principles from Anglo-American jurisprudence derived from Roman and Civil Law [7, 8]. The document clearly and unequivocally declared the existence of the trust, complying with the requirement that proof of trust be clear and satisfactory [9]. The fact that the beneficiaries were not notified or did not accept at the time of creation is immaterial, as acceptance is presumed in voluntary trusts [10].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that in the absence of any reservation of the power to revoke, a voluntary trust is irrevocable without the consent of the beneficiary [11]. The attempted revocation by the respondents alone was without legal effect. The respondents, as trustees, were duty-bound to deliver the property to the *cestui que trust* free from liens and encumbrances [12].

**Decision affirmed with modification** regarding the accounting of fruits, which shall begin from the date the judgment in the related probate case (G.R. No. L-8774) became final and executory [13].
