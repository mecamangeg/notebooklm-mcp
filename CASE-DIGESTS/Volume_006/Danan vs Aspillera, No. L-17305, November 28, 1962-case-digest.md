I. CAPTION
DOMINADOR DANAN and ADORACION FERNANDEZ vs. HON. A. H. ASPILLERA and HON. ALEJANDRO A. GALANG, Commissioners of PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION and CORTISAN & COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-17305, November 28, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Danan and Fernandez held a certificate of public convenience (CPC) for an ice plant in Orion, Bataan [1]. On February 2, 1960, the Public Service Commission (PSC) issued an order revoking their CPC based on an engineer's report alleging abandonment of service since 1956 [2]. This revocation was issued *ex parte*, without giving the petitioners notice or a hearing [3]. Shortly after, the PSC granted a CPC to respondent Cortisan & Co. for an ice plant in the same municipality [4].

Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration and reopening, which the PSC denied in an order dated April 5, 1960 [5]. Petitioners admitted receiving a copy of this denial order on July 21, 1960 [5]. They subsequently filed a Petition for Review with the Supreme Court on August 22, 1960 [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for review was filed within the reglementary period.
2. W/N the *ex parte* revocation of the petitioners' certificate of public convenience was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court found that the petition was filed thirty-two (32) days after the petitioners received notice of the order denying their motion for reconsideration [6]. Under Section 36 of Commonwealth Act No. 146 (Public Service Act) and Section 1, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, a petition for review must be filed within thirty (30) days [6, 7]. Since the filing exceeded the reglementary period, the PSC orders cancelling the petitioners' certificate and granting the respondent's certificate had already become final, irrevocable, and executory [7].

2. **NO.** Although the petition was denied on procedural grounds, the Court emphatically ruled that the PSC's practice of revoking certificates without previous notice and opportunity for the operator to explain their side is illegal [3]. Such *ex parte* revocation violates the due process clause of the Constitution, the express provisions of Section 16(n) of the Public Service Act, and established doctrines in cases such as *Bohol Land Trans. v. Jureidini* [3]. The Court reminded the Commissioners to maintain regard for constitutional rights and the Civil Code provisions on the individual responsibility of public officers [3].

The petition for review is denied [8].
