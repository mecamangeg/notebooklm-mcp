I. CAPTION
CAMPOS RUEDA CORPORATION v. HON. JOSE S. BAUTISTA, et al., G.R. No. L-18453, September 29, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Manuel Muyot was employed by petitioner at its gasoline station from May 21, 1949, to December 31, 1953. On November 26, 1958, almost five years after his employment was terminated, Muyot filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to recover compensation for alleged overtime, Sunday, and holiday services rendered during his employment. He did not ask for reinstatement in his complaint. Petitioner moved to dismiss the case on the ground that the CIR lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter, as the claim was for a mere collection of money without a prayer for reinstatement. The CIR denied the motion to dismiss and the subsequent motion for reconsideration. During the pendency of the case, Muyot attempted to amend his complaint to include a charge of illegal dismissal and a prayer for reinstatement to bring the case within the CIR's jurisdiction.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over a claim for overtime pay when the employer-employee relationship has been terminated and the employee does not seek reinstatement.
2. W/N a complaint can be amended to confer jurisdiction upon a court that originally lacked it.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the CIR has no jurisdiction over the case. Jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint [1]. Where the employer-employee relationship has ceased and the employee does not seek reinstatement, claims for overtime and holiday pay become mere money claims that fall under the jurisdiction of the regular courts [2]. The Court cited *Price Stabilization Corporation v. Court of Industrial Relations*, which established that the CIR only has jurisdiction over such claims if the employer-employee relationship exists or is sought to be reestablished through a prayer for reinstatement [2, 3].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that a complaint cannot be amended to confer jurisdiction on the court in which it is filed if the cause of action originally set forth was not within that court's jurisdiction [4]. The insufficiency of the allegations in Muyot's original complaint could not be cured by his subsequent attempt to amend it to include a prayer for reinstatement [4, 5].

The petition for certiorari and prohibition was granted, and the orders of the CIR were annulled [6].
