I. CAPTION
MANUEL F. CABAL v. HON. RUPERTO KAPUNAN, JR. and THE CITY FISCAL OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-19052, December 29, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Col. Jose C. Maristela filed a letter-complaint with the Secretary of National Defense charging petitioner Manuel F. Cabal, then Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, with graft, corrupt practices, and unexplained wealth [1]. The President created a Committee to investigate the charge [1].

During the investigation, the Committee ordered Cabal to take the witness stand and be sworn in as a witness for the complainant, Col. Maristela [2]. Cabal objected and refused to be sworn, invoking his constitutional right against self-incrimination [2]. Consequently, the Committee referred the matter to the City Fiscal of Manila, who filed a charge for contempt against Cabal in the Court of First Instance of Manila (Criminal Case No. 60111), presided over by respondent Judge Ruperto Kapunan, Jr. [2], [3], [4].

Cabal filed a motion to quash the charge, arguing that the Committee could not compel him to testify in violation of his right against self-incrimination [4]. Judge Kapunan denied the motion [5]. Cabal filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition to enjoin the lower court from proceeding with the criminal case [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the proceedings for forfeiture of unexplained wealth under Republic Act No. 1379 are criminal in nature, entitling the petitioner to refuse to take the witness stand based on his right against self-incrimination.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that proceedings for the forfeiture of property under Republic Act No. 1379 (Anti-Graft Law) are deemed criminal or penal in nature [7].

Although technically a civil proceeding, the forfeiture of property "manifestly out of proportion to [a public officer's] salary" partakes of the nature of a penalty [8]. Citing *Boyd v. U.S.*, the Court explained that suits for penalties and forfeitures are within the reason of criminal proceedings for the purposes of the constitutional provision against self-incrimination [9], [10].

Therefore, the exemption of defendants in criminal cases from the obligation to be witnesses against themselves is applicable [9]. Unlike in ordinary civil cases where a witness may only refuse to answer specific incriminatory questions, in criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings, the accused has the right to refuse to take the witness stand altogether [11], [12].

The Court distinguished this from *Almeda v. Perez*, which held forfeiture proceedings to be civil, clarifying that *Almeda* referred only to the procedural aspect (amendment of pleadings) and not the substantial rights of the accused [13], [14].

The petition was **GRANTED**, and the respondent Judge was permanently enjoined from proceeding with the contempt charge [15].
