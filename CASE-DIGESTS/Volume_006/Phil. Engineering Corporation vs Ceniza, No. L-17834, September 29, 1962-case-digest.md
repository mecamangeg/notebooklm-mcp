I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE ENGINEERING CORPORATION, GONZALO DEL ROSARIO and ELEUTERIO AGUIRRE v. THE HON. PATRICIO C. CENIZA, THE CLERK OF COURT, THE SHERIFF OF THE CITY OF MANILA and EMIGDIO C. SERNA, G.R. No. L-17834, September 29, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Emigdio C. Serna filed a suit against petitioners in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Misamis Occidental. The CFI rendered judgment ordering petitioners to pay Serna roughly P6,600.00, plus P3,000.00 moral damages and P2,000.00 attorney's fees, with "interest of 6% from the date the complaint was filed until the full amount... is satisfied." [1, 2] The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision *in toto*, and it became final and executory. [2]

During execution, petitioners moved to amend the writ of execution, arguing that: (1) the 6% interest should not apply to the moral damages and attorney's fees; and (2) interest should be computed from the date of the *amended* complaint, not the original. [3, 4] The CFI denied these requests. Petitioners filed a petition for *certiorari*, claiming the lower court abused its discretion. [4]

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the final judgment can be modified at the execution stage to exclude interest on damages and attorney's fees.
2. W/N the interest should commence from the filing of the amended complaint rather than the original complaint.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A modification of a judgment at the execution stage cannot be allowed. Under the doctrine of *res judicata*, a final valid judgment is conclusive not only on issues actually determined but on all issues that could have been raised in the anterior suit. If petitioners felt aggrieved by the inclusion of interest on damages and fees, they should have appealed that specific issue before the judgment became final. Having failed to do so, they are barred from seeking modification now that the judgment is executory. [5]

2. **NO.** The final decision specifically declared the date of the original complaint (October 28, 1954) as the start of the running of interest. Furthermore, the amended complaint merely amplified the items of damage without introducing a new cause of action; thus, the amended claim relates back to the filing of the original pleading (*Guazo v. Ramirez*, 32 Phil. 492). [6]

The petition is **DISMISSED**. [7]
