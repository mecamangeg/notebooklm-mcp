I. CAPTION
MANUEL S. GALVEZ, ET AL. v. VALENTINA TAGLE VDA. DE KANGLEON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17197, September 29, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
In 1947, Ruperto K. Kangleon applied to the Rural Progress Administration (RPA) for a home lot in the La Faja Del Mar Estate, which was adjudicated to him. On August 13, 1950, the RPA manager sent Kangleon a letter and a sales memorandum containing the lot's data. Kangleon neither replied nor paid the first installment. Believing Kangleon had abandoned his right, and noting that Venancio Presingular and others were the actual residents/occupants of the lot, the RPA manager sold the lot to Presingular in December 1950. Presingular subsequently sold his rights to Spouses Manuel and Ester Galvez, who eventually secured a Transfer Certificate of Title. Kangleon protested to the Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, but they upheld the sale to Presingular and Galvez, citing Kangleon's negligence. Kangleon filed an action for specific performance and annulment of the sale. The Court of First Instance ruled in Kangleon's favor, declaring the Galvez title void. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that a perfected contract of sale existed between RPA and Kangleon.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a perfected contract of sale existed between the RPA and Kangleon.
2. W/N the sale to Presingular and subsequently to Spouses Galvez was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the mere allotment of a lot by the RPA via a sales memorandum did not create a perfected contract of sale. The documents were merely an application to purchase, which did not ripen into a juridical relation because Kangleon failed to sign a contract or pay the purchase price. Citing *Alvarez v. Board of Liquidators*, the Court held that such administrative allotments are not ordinary deeds of sale but applications subject to revocation. Consequently, Kangleon could not compel specific performance as there was no binding contract.

2. **YES.** The Court held that the administrative officials did not abuse their discretion in selling the lot to Presingular. Kangleon's failure to pay or reply demonstrated a lack of interest amounting to negligence. Furthermore, the Court established that the veteran's preference under Republic Act No. 65 applies only to the purchase of public agricultural farms or subdivisions, not to lands acquired for homesite purposes like the La Faja Del Mar Estate. As the lot was for a homesite, the policy preference for actual occupants (Presingular) prevailed.

The petition is granted. The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the action for specific performance is dismissed.
