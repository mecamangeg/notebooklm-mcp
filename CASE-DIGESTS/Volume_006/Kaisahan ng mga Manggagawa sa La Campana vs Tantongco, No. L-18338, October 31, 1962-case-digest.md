I. CAPTION
KAISAHAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA SA LA CAMPANA v. RICARDO TANTONGCO and THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-18338, October 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On January 18, 1957, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ordered La Campana Starch and Coffee Factory and its administrator, Ricardo Tantongco, to reinstate 12 employees and pay their back wages [1]. The order became final, but Tantongco allegedly refused to comply. On September 30, 1957, the CIR issued another order requiring compliance within five days [2]. Upon continued alleged refusal, a complaint for Indirect Contempt was filed against Tantongco [2].

During the contempt proceedings, after the prosecution rested, Tantongco filed a Motion to Dismiss (demurrer to evidence) [3]. The Trial Judge deferred resolution of the motion and required Tantongco to present evidence. When Tantongco failed to appear at the scheduled hearing, the Trial Judge considered the case submitted and rendered a judgment convicting him of indirect contempt [3, 4].

On appeal, the CIR *en banc* reversed the conviction and dismissed the case [4, 5]. It found that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Tantongco actually received the September 30 order, as it was served to a certain Mr. Fernandez whose authority to receive it was not established [6, 7]. The CIR *en banc* also held that the Trial Judge denied Tantongco due process by not resolving the Motion to Dismiss first [8, 9]. Petitioner Kaisahan appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the CIR erred in dismissing the case given a prior SC ruling that Tantongco was the proper person to comply with the orders [10].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court can review the factual finding of the CIR that the respondent did not receive the order subject of the contempt charge.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the findings of fact by the CIR are final and conclusive and are binding upon the Court when: (1) the parties were given the opportunity to present evidence; (2) the tribunal considered the evidence presented; (3) there is something to support the findings; and (4) the evidence supporting the findings is substantial [11, 12].

The Court cited *Ormoc Sugar Co., Inc. v. Osco Workers Fraternity Labor* to support this doctrine [12]. The CIR *en banc* found that the order was not actually served on Tantongco but on a third party without proven authority, rendering the evidence insufficient for a criminal conviction like indirect contempt [6, 7]. Since indirect contempt is penal in nature, the accused cannot be convicted if it does not appear beyond doubt that he received the orders he allegedly disobeyed [13, 14]. The High Court found no grave abuse of discretion in the CIR's findings.

The petition was dismissed and the decision of the CIR *en banc* was affirmed [15].
