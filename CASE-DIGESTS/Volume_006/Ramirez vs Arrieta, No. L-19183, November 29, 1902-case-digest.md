I. CAPTION
FILOMENA RAMIREZ, ET AL. v. HON. ABUNDIO Z. ARRIETA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19183, November 29, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Ramirez et al. filed an action for annulment of title against Apolinar Serina et al. in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Misamis Oriental, which dismissed the complaint [1]. Petitioners filed a notice of appeal. The 30-day reglementary period ended on July 16, 1961 (a Sunday), so they filed the record on appeal and appeal bond on the next day, July 17 [2]. However, the bond was initially signed by only one surety. Upon the clerk's suggestion, the bond was signed by the second surety and filed the following day, July 18 [2]. Respondents opposed the bond as being filed beyond the reglementary period. The trial court disapproved the bond, dismissed the appeal, and declared the judgment final and executory [3]. Petitioners filed a petition for mandamus [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed due to the alleged defect of the appeal bond being subscribed by only one surety initially.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court granted the petition and ordered the lower court to give due course to the appeal [4].

The Court ruled that the dismissal was harsh and improvident. First, Section 5, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court does not expressly require two sureties for a personal appeal bond; it is sufficient that the bond be approved by the court [5]. By analogy to Section 3, Rule 40 regarding appeals from municipal courts, one surety is sufficient as long as they are solvent and acceptable to the court [5].

Second, even if two sureties were required, the defect did not deprive the court of jurisdiction because the bond was filed within the reglementary period [6]. Citing the principle that rules of procedure should be liberally construed (Rule 1, Section 2), the Court held that a defective bond filed in good faith confers jurisdiction upon the court to order its amendment rather than dismiss the appeal outright [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala and Makalintal, JJ., concurred) [4].
