I. CAPTION
EULALIA LLABAN ABELLA, ET AL. v. HON. JOSE S. RODRIGUEZ, NECITACION ESTRERA, and REGISTER OF DEEDS OF CEBU CITY, G.R. No. L-17889, December 29, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Necitacion Estrera filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Cebu, acting as a cadastral court, for the cancellation of Original Certificate of Title No. RO-1963 covering Lot No. 6002. She claimed she purchased the lot from the heirs of Fernando Cavan and sought the issuance of a new title in her name [1]. Petitioners Abella, et al. opposed the petition, asserting they are the legal heirs of some of the registered owners and that the alleged deed of sale was unenforceable against their registered rights [2].

During the hearing on September 13, 1960, petitioners failed to appear. Respondent Judge Rodriguez declared them in default and considered their opposition withdrawn [3]. Consequently, the Judge ordered the cancellation of the old title and the issuance of a new Transfer Certificate of Title to Estrera [3]. Petitioners’ motions for reconsideration and for cancellation of the new title were denied [4]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the cadastral court lacked jurisdiction [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance, acting as a land registration court, has jurisdiction to grant a petition for cancellation of title under Section 112 of the Land Registration Act when there is a serious opposition involved.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that while Section 112 of the Land Registration Act (Act No. 496) allows a registered owner or interested person to petition for a new certificate or cancellation, such relief can only be granted if there is **unanimity among the parties** [5, 6]. Unanimity means the absence of any adverse claim or serious objection on the part of any party in interest [5].

The remedy under Section 112 is summary in nature and is not adequate for the litigation of issues pertaining to an ordinary civil action [7]. In this case, a serious controversy exists: Estrera claims ownership by purchase, while petitioners claim ownership by inheritance from the registered owners [7]. Because the ownership is disputed, the case should be threshed out in an ordinary civil action or a separate proceeding, not in a summary cadastral proceeding [7].

The petition is granted, and the lower court's orders are set aside. The petition for cancellation of title filed by Estrera is dismissed without prejudice to filing a new one in the proper court [8].
