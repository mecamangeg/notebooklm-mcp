I. CAPTION
**J. M. TUASON & Co., INC. v. AMBROSIO CABILDO**, G.R. No. L-17168, October 31, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff J. M. Tuason & Co., Inc. is the registered owner of a parcel of land in Quezon City covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1267. In July 1950, defendant Ambrosio Cabildo entered a portion of the land without the plaintiff’s consent and constructed a house. Plaintiff filed an action to eject the defendant.

In his defense, Cabildo claimed ownership, alleging he purchased the land in 1955 from the spouses Ealdama, who in turn traced their title to Pedro Deudor. Cabildo sought reimbursement for improvements worth P12,000, claiming he was a builder in good faith.

The Court of First Instance (CFI) rendered a decision ordering Cabildo to vacate the premises and pay monthly rentals, finding that the plaintiff's Torrens title is indefeasible. The trial court also found Cabildo to be in bad faith because the deed of sale explicitly warned him of a pending litigation between Tuason & Co. and his predecessor-in-interest, Deudor. Cabildo appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law, challenging the delegation of evidence reception to a referee and invoking Republic Act No. 3453 to suspend the ejectment.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the delegation of the reception of evidence to a referee was valid despite the lack of a previous agreement between the parties.
2. W/N the defendant is a builder in good faith entitled to indemnity for improvements.
3. W/N the ejectment proceeding should be suspended pursuant to Republic Act No. 3453.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held there was substantial compliance with Section 1, Rule 34 of the Rules of Court. Although no agreement was made prior to the delegation to the court stenographer as referee, the trial court suggested the procedure to both parties, and they "readily gave their conformity thereto." Furthermore, the parties appeared before the referee, submitted evidence, and cross-examined witnesses, meaning no harm was done to the appellant [1].

2. **NO.** The defendant is not a purchaser or builder in good faith. The Court affirmed the lower court's finding that when Cabildo acquired the land from the Ealdama spouses, he was "expressly warned that there was a pending litigation on the property" between the plaintiff and Pedro Deudor. Having bought the property knowing of a flaw in the seller's title, he acted in bad faith and, under Article 449 of the Civil Code, loses what is built without right to indemnity [2].

3. **NO.** The Court declared Section 4 of Republic Act No. 3453 unconstitutional. The Act, which mandated the suspension of ejectment proceedings even in the absence of expropriation proceedings, amounts to a confiscation of private property without due process. The Court ruled that the government cannot indefinitely deprive an owner of their rights over property while refraining from filing expropriation proceedings [3, 4].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against appellant [5].
