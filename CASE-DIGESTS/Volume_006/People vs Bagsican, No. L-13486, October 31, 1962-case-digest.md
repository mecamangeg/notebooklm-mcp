I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. VALENTIN BAGSICAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-13486, October 31, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Valentin Bagsican and his son, Culito Bagsican, had a boundary dispute with their neighbor, the victim Calixto Acorin [1]. On June 15, 1956, while the victim was overseeing laborers on his land, Culito called him over to settle the dispute. As the victim approached, he saw Valentin and engaged him in conversation instead. Culito then treacherously stabbed the victim from behind [2-4]. The victim fled, but Culito and Valentin chased him, with Valentin shouting encouragement to kill him. Two shots were heard, and Culito later emerged holding a blood-smeared bolo, threatening the laborers not to testify [5, 6].

The Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Norte convicted Culito as principal and Valentin as accomplice for Murder. Valentin withdrew his appeal, so the review focused on Culito, who raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was in another town reporting a lost pocketbook to the police at the time of the crime [7-9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over positive identification by eyewitnesses.
2. W/N the credibility of prosecution witnesses is impaired because they are relatives or tenants of the deceased.
3. W/N a finding of no *prima facie* case during preliminary investigation bars subsequent prosecution and conviction.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that alibi is a defense easily concocted and must be received with great caution [10, 11]. When the identification and participation of the accused are established by positive and competent evidence, the plea of alibi cannot be availed of [12, 13]. The Court found the documentary evidence for the alibi (a police blotter entry) dubious and likely fabricated to suit the defense [14, 15].

2. **NO.** The Court held that oral declarations of interested witnesses are not necessarily biased or incredible; on the contrary, it would be unnatural for persons interested in vindicating the crime to impute it to anyone other than the true culprits [16, 17]. Furthermore, minor inconsistencies in their testimonies do not affect their credibility but rather indicate truthfulness [18]. The Court also reiterated that witnesses not listed in the complaint may still be called to testify [19, 20].

3. **NO.** The Court held that a finding in the preliminary investigation that no *prima facie* case existed does not bar subsequent prosecution and conviction [21, 22]. Such a finding is not a final acquittal that would preclude further proceedings under the doctrine of double jeopardy [20].

**Judgment affirmed.**
