I. CAPTION
BENJAMIN MASANGCAY v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, G.R. No. L-13827, September 28, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Benjamin Masangcay, the Provincial Treasurer of Aklan, was designated by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to take charge of the receipt, custody, and distribution of official ballots and election supplies for the province [1, 2]. He was charged with contempt before the COMELEC for opening three boxes of official and sample ballots in violation of COMELEC resolutions, which required such opening to be done in the presence of the Division Superintendent of Schools, the Provincial Auditor, and representatives of the Nacionalista, Liberal, and Citizens’ Parties [1, 3].

After a hearing where Masangcay pleaded not guilty, the COMELEC rendered a decision finding him guilty of contempt and sentencing him to three months imprisonment and a fine of P500 [2]. Masangcay appealed to the Supreme Court, challenging the constitutionality of Section 5 of the Revised Election Code and the COMELEC's power to punish for contempt, arguing it infringed on the separation of powers [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Commission on Elections has the power to punish for contempt in the exercise of its ministerial functions regarding the distribution of election supplies.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Supreme Court ruled that the COMELEC lacks the power to impose disciplinary penalties for contempt when exercising ministerial functions [5].

The Court distinguished between the COMELEC's quasi-judicial power to decide controversies and its administrative duties [5]. The resolutions Masangcay allegedly violated concerned the procedure for distributing ballots, which is an administrative or ministerial function [3]. Citing *Guevara v. Commission on Elections*, the Court held that the power to punish for contempt is inherently judicial in nature and essential to the administration of justice [5, 6]. An administrative body cannot exercise this power in furtherance of its administrative or ministerial duties [6]. Since the COMELEC was discharging a ministerial duty in regulating the distribution of ballots, it exceeded its jurisdiction in punishing the petitioner for contempt [3].

The decision and resolution appealed from are REVERSED [7].
