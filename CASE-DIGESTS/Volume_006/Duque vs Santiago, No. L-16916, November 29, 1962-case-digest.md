I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO Q. DUQUE, HUGO S. ESTRADA, MARIA C. MAGSANO and RESTITUTO C. BASA v. HON. AMADO S. SANTIAGO, EMETERIO M. CASTAÑEDA and CONRADO F. ESTRELLA, G.R. No. L-16916, November 29, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On July 18, 1959, the Provincial Fiscal of Pangasinan filed an information for libel against petitioners Francisco Duque, et al., upon the complaint of respondent Governor Conrado F. Estrella [1]. The petitioners filed a motion to quash the information on two grounds: (1) the publication was a privileged communication under Article 354 of the Revised Penal Code, being a fair comment on the official acts of a public officer and candidate for reelection; and (2) the information charged two offenses, libel and oral defamation (slander), as it alleged that the accused also uttered the substance of the libelous article publicly and privately [2-4].

Respondent Judge Amado S. Santiago denied the motion to quash, ruling that the privileged character of the publication is a matter of defense to be proven at trial [5]. The motion for reconsideration was also denied [3]. Consequently, petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court to annul the order and enjoin their arraignment, arguing that a criminal action does not lie for privileged communications [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the information should be quashed on the ground that the publication is a privileged communication.
2. W/N the denial of the motion to quash is proper subject for certiorari or appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The claim that a publication is a privileged communication is not a legal ground for the quashal of an information; it is a matter of defense [5, 7]. The Court held that even if a publication is privileged under Article 354 of the Revised Penal Code, this characterization only destroys the presumption of malice [7]. The burden of proving malice shifts to the plaintiff, and the existence of malice—whether the accused was prompted by ill-will or acted merely in response to duty—is a factual matter that can only be determined after a trial on the merits (*U.S. v. Cañete*; *Lu Chu Sing v. Lu Tiong Gui*) [4, 8].

2. **NO.** The denial of a motion to quash is an interlocutory order and cannot be appealed [9]. The trial court must be allowed to pass upon the issues of privilege and duplicity of offenses during the trial. If the trial court rules adversely to the petitioners, these issues may be raised and reviewed on appeal after a final judgment is rendered [9]. The respondent judge did not commit grave abuse of discretion in denying the motion.

The writ prayed for is denied, and the writ of preliminary injunction is dissolved [10].
