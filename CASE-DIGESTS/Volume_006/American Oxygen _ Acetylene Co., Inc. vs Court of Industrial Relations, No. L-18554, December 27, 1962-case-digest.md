I. CAPTION
AMERICAN OXYGEN & ACETYLENE COMPANY, INC. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and ISIDRO NATAVIO, G.R. No. L-18554, December 27, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Isidro Natavio filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against petitioner American Oxygen & Acetylene Co. claiming unpaid overtime, Sunday, and holiday pay from 1948 to 1958 [1]. In his original petition, Natavio stated that his claim for reinstatement was pending before Regional Office No. 3 [1]. Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss citing lack of jurisdiction and prescription [2]. Subsequently, Natavio filed an amended petition—which was not subscribed or sworn to—changing the dates of his overtime work and adding a new allegation that the company refused to readmit him after he was cured of an illness [2, 3]. These changes were made without leave of court to avoid the defenses raised by the petitioner [3]. The CIR trial judge dismissed the petition, but the CIR *en banc* set aside the dismissal and gave due course to the amended petition [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR acquired jurisdiction over the case through the amended petition which sought to cure the jurisdictional defects of the original petition.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the amendment of the original complaint by inserting allegations to confer jurisdiction upon the court is unauthorized and the amended petition is "sham" [5, 6]. The Court noted that the original petition was verified while the amended one was not, and the changes were made specifically to avoid the defense of lack of jurisdiction [3]. Citing *Campos Rueda Corporation v. Bautista* and *Rosario v. Carandang*, the Court held that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the original complaint, and a complaint cannot be amended to confer jurisdiction if the cause of action originally set forth was not within the court's jurisdiction [6, 7].

The writ was granted, the order of the CIR denying the motion to dismiss was set aside, and the original petition was ordered dismissed [8].
