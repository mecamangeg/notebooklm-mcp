I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO LAO alias ME-O v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17054, November 29, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Francisco Lao filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Leyte, which granted the petition on March 2, 1959 [1]. The Republic appealed the decision. The record revealed that Lao had five children born out of wedlock between 1949 and 1957 with Josefina Cawaling [2]. He cohabited with her for almost 12 years without the benefit of clergy and only married her on April 18, 1958, just four days before filing his petition for naturalization [2]. Additionally, Lao reported an annual income of P1,200.00 as a merchant since 1950 [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the petitioner conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner suitable for naturalization.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner's annual income of P1,200.00 is not considered lucrative within the meaning of the Revised Naturalization Law [3].

2. **NO.** The petitioner’s conduct of cohabiting with his wife for almost 12 years and begetting five children without the benefit of clergy constitutes improper and reproachable conduct [2, 3]. Such a common-law relationship demonstrates a lack of good moral character required for aliens desiring to become Filipino citizens, as established in *Gavino Lao v. Republic* [2].

The decree appealed from is reversed and the petition for naturalization is denied [4].
