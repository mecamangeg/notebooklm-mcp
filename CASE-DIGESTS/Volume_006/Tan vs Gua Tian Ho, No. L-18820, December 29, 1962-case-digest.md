I. CAPTION
HADJI ABUBAKAR TAN v. EDUARDO GUA TIAN HO, G.R. No. L-18820, December 29, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On January 11, 1958, plaintiff Hadji Abubakar Tan purchased 5 tons of sea sponges from defendant Eduardo Gua Tian Ho for P5,000.00 [1]. Due to the defendant's inability to deliver the full amount, Tan rescinded the contract and demanded the return of his payment [2]. The defendant returned P2,000.00 and executed a promissory note for the remaining P3,000.00, payable by February 1958 [2, 3]. When the defendant failed to pay, Tan filed a complaint for the collection of the sum [1, 3].

In his Answer, the defendant admitted the execution of the note and his failure to pay but denied that his failure to deliver the sponges was the cause of the rescission [4]. As affirmative defenses, he alleged that Tan rescinded because Tan was "fooled by his proposed buyers" and that Tan had agreed to deduct the defendant's expenses (labor, transportation, etc.) from the amount to be returned [5, 6]. The defendant also filed a counterclaim for these expenses and unrealized profits [6].

Tan moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing the defendant admitted the material allegations [7]. The Court of First Instance of Sulu granted the motion and ordered the defendant to pay the P3,000.00 [7]. The defendant appealed [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N judgment on the pleadings was proper.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's order. Under Section 10, Rule 35 of the Rules of Court (now Rule 34), judgment on the pleadings is only proper when the answer fails to tender an issue or otherwise admits all the material allegations of the adverse party's pleading [9, 10].

Here, the defendant’s Answer tendered valid issues of fact. While he admitted the promissory note, he set up affirmative defenses claiming that the plaintiff agreed to deduct expenses incurred by the defendant as a result of the rescission [10]. These allegations raised questions of fact regarding the amount actually due, which could not be resolved without the presentation of evidence [10]. The Court cited *Fabella v. Provincial Sheriff of Rizal* and *Santiago v. Conde*, reiterating that judgment on the pleadings cannot be rendered if the defendant's pleading tenders an issue [11].

The Order appealed from is **REVERSED** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [12].
