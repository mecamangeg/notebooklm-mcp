I. CAPTION
**REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JOSE V. BAGTAS (subst. by FELICIDAD M. BAGTAS), G.R. No. L-17474, October 25, 1962, Padilla, J.**

II. FACTS
On May 8, 1948, Jose V. Bagtas borrowed three bulls from the Republic (Bureau of Animal Industry) for a period of one year for breeding purposes, subject to a breeding fee of 10% of the book value. Upon the contract's expiration in 1949, Bagtas retained the bulls. He offered to buy them at a depreciated value, but the Director of Animal Industry refused and demanded their return or payment of the book value. Bagtas did neither. The Republic filed a suit in the CFI of Manila to recover the bulls or their value.

During the pendency of the case, Jose Bagtas died on October 23, 1951. In 1956, the trial court ruled against the defendant. In 1958, the Republic obtained a writ of execution. Felicidad Bagtas, the administratrix of Jose’s estate, moved to quash the writ. She argued that two bulls had been returned in 1952, and the third bull (Sahiniwal) was killed during a Huk raid in 1953, which she claimed was *force majeure* exempting the estate from liability. She further argued that the judgment should be filed as a money claim in the probate court. The CFI denied her motion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the estate is liable for the loss of the bull due to *force majeure*.
2. W/N the money judgment can be enforced by a writ of execution against the estate.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The estate is liable. The Court held that if the 10% breeding fee is considered compensation, the contract is a lease. Under Article 1671 of the Civil Code, the lessee is liable as a possessor in bad faith for withholding the animal after the contract expired. Even if the contract is *commodatum* (essentially gratuitous), the bailee is still liable for loss due to a fortuitous event under Article 1942 of the Civil Code because: (1) Bagtas kept the bull longer than the stipulated period; and (2) the bull was delivered with an appraisal of its value, and there was no stipulation exempting the bailee from responsibility in case of a fortuitous event [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The judgment cannot be enforced by a writ of execution. Since special proceedings for the administration and settlement of the estate of the deceased had been instituted, the money judgment rendered in favor of the Republic must be presented to the probate court for payment by the administratrix, rather than enforced via execution [3, 4].

Accordingly, the writ of execution is set aside.
