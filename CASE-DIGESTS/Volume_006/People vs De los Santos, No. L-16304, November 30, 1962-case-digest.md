I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. EMILIO DE LOS SANTOS, AURELIO DE LOS SANTOS, PEDRO DE LOS SANTOS, and ENRIQUE NATIVIDAD, G.R. No. L-16304, November 30, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On April 13, 1956, in Lasam, Cagayan, the accused entered the store of spouses Uy King and Estefania Pagtama [1]. Pedro de los Santos struck Estefania, took P700.00, and shot open a drawer to steal another P800.00 [1], [2]. While the robbery was in progress, Eusebio Clemente (who remained at large) shot and killed Uy King near the kitchen [2], [3]. Witnesses positively identified Emilio and Aurelio de los Santos guarding the door with bolos, while Pedro used a revolver and the killer used a long firearm [3], [4]. The Court of First Instance convicted the accused of robbery in band with homicide and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua* [5]. The accused appealed, interposing the defense of alibi, claiming they were in nearby locations playing mahjong or threshing palay [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused are guilty of robbery in band with homicide despite the defense of alibi.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, ruling that the defense of alibi cannot prosper in the face of positive identification by three prosecution witnesses who saw the accused in the store [6]. Furthermore, the Court noted that the place where the crime occurred was only one kilometer away from where the accused claimed to be [6].

The Court also held that the crime was committed by a band (*cuadrilla*). Contrary to the trial court's uncertainty regarding the number of armed men, the appellate review established that four men carried arms: one used a long firearm, Pedro used a revolver, and Emilio and Aurelio each had drawn bolos [4]. Under Art. 294, par. 1 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for robbery in band with homicide is death [7]. However, as there was no sufficient number of Justices to approve the death penalty, the Court imposed *reclusion perpetua* [8]. The judgment was affirmed with modifications [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
