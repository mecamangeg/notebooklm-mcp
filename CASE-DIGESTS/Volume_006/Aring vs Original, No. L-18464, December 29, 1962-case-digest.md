I. CAPTION
ARING (BAGOBA), ET AL. v. JOSE (NAKAMURA) ORIGINAL, G.R. No. L-18464, December 29, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On July 27, 1955, respondent Jose (Nakamura) Original filed Civil Case No. 765 against petitioners Aring (Bagoba), et al. to recover ownership and possession of two parcels of land in Davao. Original claimed to be the acknowledged natural son and only heir of Obot (Bagoba), the original owner, and alleged that petitioners obtained titles to the land through false representations [1, 2]. The trial court rendered a decision on August 30, 1956, declaring Original the owner and ordering the cancellation of petitioners' titles [3]. The Court of Appeals dismissed petitioners' appeal, and the decision became final [3].

On January 11, 1961, petitioners filed the present action (Civil Case No. 3465) to annul the 1956 decision and recover the same properties [4]. They alleged that the prior judgment was obtained by fraud because Original misrepresented his heirship, and that the court lacked jurisdiction as the action was effectively a petition for review of a decree which had prescribed [5, 6]. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground of *res judicata* [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the present action is barred by *res judicata*.
2. W/N the prior judgment can be annulled on the ground of fraud.
3. W/N the trial court in the previous case lacked jurisdiction.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that all elements of *res judicata* are present: (a) the former judgment was final; (b) it was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (c) it was a judgment on the merits; and (d) there is identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action [7]. Although the grounds in the two cases are technically at variance, they aim at the same objective: the recovery of title and possession of the same properties [7].

2. **NO.** The fraud alleged by petitioners was not extrinsic or collateral. Original expressly alleged in his complaint that he was the acknowledged natural child of the deceased, an allegation petitioners disputed in the first case [5]. Since the issue was litigated, there was no fraudulent representation preventing a fair trial, and intrinsic fraud cannot serve as a basis for annulment of judgment [5].

3. **NO.** The previous action was not a petition for review of a decree under Section 38 of Act 496, which prescribes after one year [8]. Rather, it was an action for the annulment of the new titles issued to petitioners on the ground of fraud, which falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance [6, 8].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Labrador and Concepcion concurred in the result [9].
