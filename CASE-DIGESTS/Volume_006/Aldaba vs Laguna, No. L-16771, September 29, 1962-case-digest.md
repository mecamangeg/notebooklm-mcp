I. CAPTION
VICENTE ALDABA, ET AL. v. HON. ARTEMIO ELEPAÑO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16771, September 29, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Vicente Aldaba filed a criminal complaint for trespass against Norberto Palis and two others in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Los Baños. The accused admitted entering Aldaba's property and cutting banana stalks but claimed they had permission and were willing to pay. JP Artemio Elepaño acquitted the accused on the ground of reasonable doubt but did not order them to pay civil damages in the same decision, merely noting that their liability could be resolved in a civil claim [1].

Claiming the Judge rendered an unjust decision by failing to award the P500 civil liability in the criminal case, Aldaba filed a civil action for damages against JP Elepaño and the three accused. Aldaba invoked Article 27 of the Civil Code, arguing the Judge neglected his official duty [1-3]. The designated acting JP dismissed the case against Elepaño. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Laguna also dismissed the complaint against the Judge. Aldaba appealed to the Supreme Court on a question of law [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a judge is civilly liable for damages for failing to order an acquitted accused to pay civil liability in the same criminal action.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. Citing the doctrine in *People v. Miranda* (G.R. No. L-17389), the Court ruled that a Justice of the Peace who does not order an accused to pay civil damages arising from a criminal offense of which he has been acquitted, despite proof of such civil liabilities, cannot be held civilly liable or answerable for damages [4, 5]. The Judge's failure to award civil indemnity in the judgment of acquittal does not constitute a violation of Article 27 of the Civil Code actionable by damages.

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [5].
