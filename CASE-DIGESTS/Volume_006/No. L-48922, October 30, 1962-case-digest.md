I. CAPTION
INTESTATE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DECEASED PEDRO ROYO: AMPARO N. VDA. DE ROYO, Administratrix of the Estate of Pedro Royo and PEDRO ROYO, JR. v. N.T. DEEN and TOMAS DELGADO, G.R. No. L-48922, October 30, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Pantaleon del Rosario was appointed administrator of the estate of Pedro Royo on October 11, 1924. During his administration, he realized P43,500 from the sale of estate properties and paid P24,890 in claims, leaving a balance of P17,610. On September 8, 1928, Del Rosario filed a "Manifestacion" (report) stating that the heirs, who were already of age, had disposed of most estate funds and that the remaining assets were insufficient to cover a P600 deficit after paying debts. Del Rosario died on November 25, 1930. The heirs of Royo did not file any claim against Del Rosario’s estate regarding the P17,610 balance.

On November 6, 1940, over 12 years after the report, Amparo Vda. de Royo (new administratrix) and Pedro Royo, Jr. filed a motion to execute the bond posted by oppositors-sureties N.T. Deen and Tomas Delgado to recover the P17,610. The Court of First Instance of Cebu denied the motion, ruling that the heirs' long silence constituted acquiescence to the 1928 report. Appellants argued that the 1928 "Manifestacion" was invalid because it was not sworn to under oath.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the administrator's report on accounts is valid even if not sworn to.
2. W/N the heirs are barred by laches or estoppel from claiming the unaccounted balance.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that an administrator, having been previously sworn to faithfully perform his duties before assuming office (Sec. 1, Rule 82), need not swear to the reports submitted in the course of administration. A report or account need only be under oath if the administrator is examined on his accounts pursuant to Section 9 of Rule 86. Since no opposition was filed necessitating such an examination, the unsworn "Manifestacion" was valid.

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the silence or acquiescence of the heirs for over 12 years regarding the correctness of the administrator's 1928 report constitutes conformity thereto. Such silence is patent proof of the absence of malfeasance. Furthermore, the heirs failed to file a claim against the estate of the deceased administrator (Del Rosario) within the proper period. Thus, they are prevented by estoppel and laches from now enforcing the bond against the sureties.

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.
