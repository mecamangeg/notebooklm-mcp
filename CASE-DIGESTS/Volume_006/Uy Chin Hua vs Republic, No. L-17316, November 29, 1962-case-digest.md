I. CAPTION
UY CHIN HUA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17316, November 29, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Uy Chin Hua, a Chinese citizen born in 1923, filed a petition for naturalization. He is married with four children, two of whom attend Hua Ming Catholic School. He is employed as an assistant manager at Richoco Products, a business owned by his mother, with a monthly salary of P145.00. He also holds investments totaling approximately P9,320.00. The petition was supported by character witnesses, including Vicente G. Ereñeta. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental granted the petition. The Government appealed, challenging the sufficiency of the petitioner's income and the qualification of his character witness.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation.
2. W/N the character witness Vicente G. Ereñeta is qualified.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that a monthly salary of P145.00 is insufficient to be considered a lucrative occupation, particularly for an applicant with a wife and four children. Citing *Te Eng Ling v. Republic*, *Velasco v. Republic*, and *Swee Din Tan v. Republic*, the Court emphasized that such income is neither lucrative nor substantial given the high cost of living and the low purchasing capacity of the currency. Even an income of P200.00 per month had previously been deemed non-lucrative for a petitioner with a similar family size.

2. **NO.** The character witness Vicente G. Ereñeta was not qualified because he did not have regular association with the petitioner. He only knew the petitioner during the Japanese occupation and played basketball with him in late 1948, with no evidence of association from 1948 until he testified. His lack of familiarity with the petitioner was further demonstrated by his erroneous testimony that the petitioner's children were enrolled in Philippine schools, when they were actually studying at a Chinese school.

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**.
