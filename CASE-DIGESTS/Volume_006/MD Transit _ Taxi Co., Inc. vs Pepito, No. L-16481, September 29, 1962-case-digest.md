I. CAPTION
MD TRANSIT & TAXI CO., INC. v. SANTIAGO PEPITO, G.R. No. L-16481, September 29, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Santiago Pepito applied with the Public Service Commission (PSC) for a certificate of public convenience to operate six auto-trucks on the Meycauayan (Bulacan) – Baclaran (Rizal) line via Bonifacio Monument and Highway 54 [1, 2]. Petitioner MD Transit & Taxi Co., Inc. and other operators opposed the application, arguing that their existing services were adequate and that the new line would cause ruinous competition [2].

On August 31, 1959, the PSC granted the certificate [3]. The Commission found that Meycauayan was a first class-B municipality with a population of 30,000 and that passengers—consisting of merchants and workers—currently had to transfer vehicles at Bonifacio Monument, often waiting at least 30 minutes for accommodation [4, 5]. The PSC determined there was a need for direct service and that Pepito was financially capable [3, 5]. MD Transit appealed, questioning the sufficiency of evidence regarding public necessity and the finding on ruinous competition [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the PSC's finding of public necessity for the proposed service is supported by sufficient evidence.
2. W/N the approval of the application constitutes ruinous competition.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the PSC's findings, ruling that questions of fact involving the evaluation of evidence and credibility of witnesses are conclusive upon the Supreme Court when supported by sufficient evidence [6]. The record established that passengers from Meycauayan destined for Baclaran or Highway 54 had to transfer at Bonifacio Monument and face significant delays [5]. The Court noted that the oppositors' existing lines did not cover the specific direct route applied for (Meycauayan–Baclaran), and the approval would serve public convenience by eliminating these transfers [7].

2. **NO.** The Court held that an opposition based on ruinous competition must be supported by evidence showing that the opponent "would be deprived of fair profits on the capital invested" [8, 9]. The mere possibility of a reduction in earnings is insufficient; it must be shown that the business would not have sufficient gains to pay a fair rate of interest on capital investment [9]. MD Transit failed to present any evidence to prove that the new service would result in ruinous and wasteful competition [10, 11].

Petition is **DENIED**. The decision of the Public Service Commission is **AFFIRMED** [12].
