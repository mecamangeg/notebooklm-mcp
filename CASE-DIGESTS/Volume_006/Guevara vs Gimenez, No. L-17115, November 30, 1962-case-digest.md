I. CAPTION
GUILLERMO B. GUEVARA v. THE HONORABLE PEDRO M. GIMENEZ, as the Auditor General of the Philippines and ISMAEL MATHAY, as the Auditor of the Central Bank, G.R. No. L-17115, November 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On September 1, 1959, Central Bank (CB) Governor Miguel Cuaderno, authorized by the Monetary Board, engaged Petitioner Guillermo Guevara to collaborate with the CB legal counsel in defending the Bank in a civil suit (*Corpus v. Cuaderno, et al.*). The agreed fees were a P10,000.00 retainer and a P300.00 per diem for every hearing [1-3]. Petitioner rendered services, appearing in court and filing various pleadings. However, when Petitioner billed the Bank, Auditor General Gimenez (Respondent) objected to the per diem as "excessive" and imposed conditions on the retainer fee, allowing only installment payments [4, 5]. Petitioner filed a petition for mandamus to compel the audit and approval of his bill. Respondents argued that under Section 1664 of the Revised Administrative Code, the CB was unauthorized to hire private counsel as the Solicitor General represents the Government [6]. However, Respondents admitted during the proceedings that P6,000.00 had already been paid to Petitioner [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Central Bank is prohibited from hiring private counsel under Section 1664 of the Revised Administrative Code.
2. W/N the Auditor General has the discretion to refuse the audit and approval of disbursements for a valid contract on the ground that the fees are excessive.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that Section 1664 of the Revised Administrative Code applies to attorneys retained in the name of the Government of the Republic to assist the Solicitor General [8]. The Central Bank has a personality distinct and separate from the Government, and Petitioner was not engaged to assist the Solicitor General, who did not intervene in the case [8]. Furthermore, the Respondents' partial payment of P6,000.00 constituted a partial performance and a clear admission of the contract's legality [7].

2. **NO.** Under Article XI, Section 2 of the Constitution, the Auditor General's function regarding expenditures is limited to determining if there is a law appropriating funds, if the contract was made by the proper officer, and if services were rendered [9]. Once these requirements are met, it is the ministerial duty of the Auditor General to approve the voucher. He has no discretion to disapprove payment based on his opinion that the contract is unwise or the amount unreasonable [9]. His duty in such cases is merely to bring to the attention of the proper administrative officer expenditures which he deems "irregular, unnecessary, excessive or extravagant," but not to refuse payment [9].

**Petition is GRANTED.** Respondents are ordered to pass in audit and approve the payment, deducting the sum already collected [10].
