I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and the COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. DEMETRIO MANJARES and MANILA SURETY & FIDELITY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-14789, November 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Demetrio Manjares owed the government P1,920.73 in taxes for the years 1946 to 1949. To prevent the public auction of his properties seized under a Warrant of Distraint and Levy, Manjares and Manila Surety & Fidelity Co., Inc. executed a bond on November 15, 1950, securing the payment of the tax obligation [1, 2]. Manjares failed to pay despite demands. On May 9, 1955, the Republic filed a complaint with the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Laoag to recover the amount [3, 4]. The JP Court ruled in favor of the Republic [5]. On appeal, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Ilocos Norte remanded the case to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) pursuant to Republic Act No. 1125, ruling that the case involved a "disputed assessment" [6]. The Republic appealed the order of remand [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Tax Appeals has jurisdiction over the action to collect on the bond.
2. W/N the action is barred by the statute of limitations under the Tax Code.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court of Tax Appeals has no jurisdiction. Under Sections 7 and 22 of R.A. No. 1125, the CTA has jurisdiction over "disputed assessments." However, upon the execution of the bond, the taxpayer's obligation was converted from a tax liability into a voluntary, contractual obligation [8, 9]. The case no longer refers to a disputed assessment but to the fulfillment of the terms of a bond, which is an action for the enforcement of a contract cognizable by the regular courts [8, 10].

2. **NO.** The statute of limitations under the Tax Code does not apply when the tax obligation has been converted into a bond. The Government's right becomes based upon a written contract, which is governed by the Civil Code [10]. Under Article 1144 of the Civil Code, an action upon a written contract prescribes in ten (10) years. Since the bond was executed in 1950 and the complaint filed in 1955, the action is well within the prescriptive period [10].

The Order remanding the case to the Court of Tax Appeals is SET ASIDE, and the case is remanded to the court of origin for appropriate proceedings [11].
