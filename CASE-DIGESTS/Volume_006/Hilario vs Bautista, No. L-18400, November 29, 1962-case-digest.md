I. CAPTION
ALFREDO HILARIO v. HON. MARCIANO D. BAUTISTA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18400, November 29, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On January 11, 1958, respondent Undersecretary of Public Works and Communications Marciano D. Bautista rendered a decision in a Water Rights case ordering petitioner Alfredo Hilario to demolish a dam he constructed, pursuant to Section 4 of Act No. 2152 (Irrigation Act) [1]. Hilario received a copy of this decision on March 6, 1958 [2]. Twenty-two (22) days later, on March 28, 1958, Hilario filed a Motion for Reconsideration [3]. He received notice of the denial of this motion on September 24, 1958 [3]. Fourteen (14) days after receiving the denial, on October 8, 1958, Hilario filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Tarlac to challenge the administrative decision [1, 2]. The CFI dismissed the complaint for being filed out of time. Hilario appealed, arguing that the 30-day appeal period should start running anew from the date he received the denial of his motion for reconsideration [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal was filed within the 30-day statutory period prescribed by Section 4 of Act No. 2152.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal, ruling that the appeal was filed beyond the statutory period. Under Section 4 of Act No. 2152, the appeal must be taken within thirty (30) days after notification of the decision [4]. The Court held that while the filing of a Motion for Reconsideration suspends the running of the period to appeal, the period continues to run—rather than beginning to run once more—upon receipt of the notice of denial [3].

Computing the time elapsed: 22 days passed between the receipt of the decision (March 6) and the filing of the Motion for Reconsideration (March 28). Another 14 days passed from the receipt of the denial (September 24) to the filing of the complaint (October 8). Adding these periods (22 + 14), the appeal was filed on the 36th day, exceeding the 30-day limit [3, 5]. The Court relied on established jurisprudence in *Centenera v. Yatco* and *Lloren v. De Veyra*, confirming that the filing of a motion for reconsideration only pauses the prescriptive period [3].

Order affirmed [5].
