I. CAPTION
ANASTACIO G. DUÑGO v. ADRIANO LOPENA, ROSA RAMOS and HON. ANDRES REYES, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, G.R. No. L-18377, December 29, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Anastacio Duñgo and one Rodrigo Gonzales purchased three parcels of land from respondents Adriano Lopena and Rosa Ramos for P269,804.00, secured by a Real Estate Mortgage [1, 2]. When the vendees defaulted on the first installment, respondents filed a foreclosure complaint [3]. Before trial, a Compromise Agreement dated January 15, 1960, was submitted and approved by the lower court. This agreement, which extended the payment deadline, was signed by the respondents and Gonzales, but not by Duñgo. However, Gonzales claimed to represent both debtors, and Duñgo's counsel, Atty. Chan, signed the agreement [4].

Subsequently, on May 3, 1960, a "Tri-Party Agreement" was executed by Duñgo, Gonzales, the respondents, and a third party, Emma R. Santos (Payor), who agreed to pay the indebtedness [5, 6]. This later agreement explicitly referred to and ratified the January 15 Order approving the Compromise Agreement [7]. When the debtors failed to pay by the extended deadline, the properties were sold at public auction [8, 9]. Duñgo later filed a motion to set aside the proceedings, arguing the Compromise Agreement was void *ab initio* as to him because he did not sign it and had not given a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) to his co-debtor or counsel to compromise [10]. The lower court denied the motion and dismissed his appeal [11].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Compromise Agreement is void due to the petitioner's absence of signature and lack of a Special Power of Attorney.
2. W/N the Tri-Party Agreement novated the original obligation and released the petitioner from liability.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** While Article 1878 of the Civil Code requires a Special Power of Attorney for a third person to compromise another's interest, the absence of such authority does not render the agreement void, but merely unenforceable under Article 1403 [12-14]. However, unenforceable contracts may be ratified. The Court held that Duñgo ratified the Compromise Agreement by signing the subsequent Tri-Party Agreement, which expressly stipulated that the Payor submitted to the force and effect of the January 15 Order approving the compromise [15]. Furthermore, Duñgo failed to promptly repudiate the action of his attorney and benefited from the extension of the payment period granted by the compromise [16].

2. **NO.** Novation by presumption is not favored and must be established by express agreement or total incompatibility between the old and new contracts [17]. The Court ruled that the Tri-Party Agreement was merely an instrument to render the Compromise Agreement effective and did not release the original debtor [18]. The assumption of an obligation by a third party (Santos) does not extinguish the liability of the original debtor unless there is an express agreement to release the latter [19].

The petition for certiorari and mandamus is DISMISSED, and the order of the lower court is AFFIRMED [20].
