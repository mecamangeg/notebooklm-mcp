I. CAPTION
THE PROVINCE OF PANGASINAN and JORGE SORIANO v. PEDRO PALISOC, JUAN AQUINO, PASCUAL LOMBOY, GENOVEVA AQUINO, and ANDRES DE LOS SANTOS, G.R. No. L-16519, October 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On August 27, 1956, the Province of Pangasinan leased the operation of the Bocboc Ferry to plaintiff Jorge Soriano. Shortly after Soriano began operations, defendants Pedro Palisoc et al. established a competing ferry and later constructed a bamboo bridge over the same route without authority from the provincial government. Soriano and the Province filed a complaint for damages and injunction against the defendants.

During the scheduled pre-trial conference on September 24, 1959, the defendants and their counsel failed to appear despite due notice. Consequently, on motion of the plaintiffs, the trial court allowed the plaintiffs to present their evidence *ex parte* before the special deputy clerk of court. The trial court subsequently rendered a decision making the preliminary injunction permanent and ordering defendants to pay damages and demolish the bridge. Defendants appealed, arguing they were deprived of their day in court and questioning the authority of the clerk of court to receive evidence.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court may allow the plaintiff to present evidence *ex parte* upon the defendant's failure to appear at the pre-trial conference.
2. W/N the trial court may delegate the reception of evidence to the deputy clerk of court.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While Section 1, Rule 25 of the Rules of Court (then in force) does not explicitly authorize the reception of evidence on the merits upon the defendant's failure to appear at pre-trial, it does not prohibit it. The Supreme Court held that since a plaintiff's failure to appear allows for the dismissal of the case (*Wisdom vs. Texas Co.*), equity and impartiality dictate that a similar sanction—allowing the plaintiff to present evidence—should apply when the defendant fails to appear. To hold otherwise would subject the pre-trial to the "whims and caprice of the defendant" and defeat the purpose of the proceeding.

2. **YES.** The procedure is sanctioned by Sections 2 and 3 of Rule 34 of the Rules of Court, which allow the court to direct a reference to a commissioner to receive and report evidence when a question of fact arises. The hearing before the commissioner proceeds as though before the court, but the duty to decide the case on the merits remains with the judge, who must personally prepare and sign the decision based on the reported evidence.

**Decision affirmed.**
