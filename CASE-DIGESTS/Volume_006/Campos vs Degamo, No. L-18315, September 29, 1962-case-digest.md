I. CAPTION
ERNESTO CAMPOS and FLORENCIO OROC v. ESTEBAN DEGAMO and FELINO PALARCA, G.R. No. L-18315, September 29, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
In the November 1959 elections in Carmen, Agusan, petitioners Campos and Oroc were elected councilors, while respondents Degamo and Palarca were proclaimed Mayor and Vice-Mayor, respectively, on December 7, 1959 [1]. On September 27, 1960, petitioners filed a *quo warranto* suit to oust respondents, alleging irregularities in the Board of Canvassers' use of election returns [1, 2]. Respondents moved to dismiss, arguing the petition was filed out of time and petitioners lacked legal personality [3]. The Court of First Instance of Agusan dismissed the petition, ruling that it was not based on Section 173 of the Revised Election Code as petitioners were not candidates for the same positions, and the one-week filing period had expired [4, 5]. Petitioners appealed directly to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for *quo warranto* is proper.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the dismissal of the petition. Under Section 173 of the Revised Election Code, a *quo warranto* proceeding must be filed by a "registered candidate for the same office" within "one week after the proclamation" of the election [6]. Petitioners were candidates for councilor, not Mayor or Vice-Mayor, and they filed the case nearly a year after the respondents' proclamation [7, 8].

Even if the case were considered an ordinary *quo warranto* under Rule 68 of the Rules of Court, it would still fail. Section 7 of Rule 68 requires the complaint to set forth the name of the person claiming to be entitled to the office [8]. The Court relied on *Luna v. Rodriguez* (38 Phil. 401) and *Acosta v. Flor* (5 Phil. 18), holding that where the office in question is elective, the complaint must show that the plaintiff was duly elected thereto [9]. Since petitioners were elected councilors, they are not the proper parties to institute the action for the positions of Mayor and Vice-Mayor.

The order appealed from is affirmed [10].
