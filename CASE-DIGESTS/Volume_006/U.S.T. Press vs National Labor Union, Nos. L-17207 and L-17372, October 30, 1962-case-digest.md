I. CAPTION
U.S.T. PRESS v. NATIONAL LABOR UNION, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-17207 and L-17372, October 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On October 1, 1955, Fr. Excelso Garcia became the director of the U.S.T. Press. Shortly after, the Rector of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) issued a directive prohibiting the press from accepting outside jobs and limiting its operations to work for the University and the Dominican fathers [1]. Consequently, the press reduced its personnel, leading to the termination of several employees [2]. Later, the University leased the press to Novel Publishing Company, which offered to employ existing workers who applied. Some employees did not apply and were subsequently laid off [3, 4].

Respondent National Labor Union filed two cases for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), alleging the dismissals were due to union activities [5]. UST filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that U.S.T. Press had no juridical personality and that Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act) did not apply to UST as a non-profit educational institution [6]. The CIR ruled in favor of the union, declaring U.S.T. Press guilty of ULP and ordering reinstatement with backwages [7]. The CIR *en banc* affirmed the decision, though two judges dissented on the issue of jurisdiction [8]. U.S.T. Press petitioned for review [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N U.S.T. Press has a separate juridical personality to be sued as a party in the ULP case.
2. W/N Republic Act No. 875 applies to the University of Santo Tomas.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that U.S.T. Press is neither a natural nor a juridical person but is merely a press operated, administered, and owned by the University of Santo Tomas. Therefore, it has no personality to be a party in the case in its own right. The real party in interest is the University of Santo Tomas [9, 10].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that Republic Act No. 875 does not apply to the University of Santo Tomas because it is an institution organized not for profit but for charitable or educational purposes. Citing *University of Santo Tomas v. Villanueva*, the Court emphasized that UST is an institution of learning devoted exclusively to the education of the youth and declares no dividends [11, 12]. Although the press accepted outside jobs, this was merely incidental to its main function, and any earnings accrued to the benefit of the University [11]. Since the real party in interest is the University, over which the CIR has no jurisdiction regarding ULP cases under RA 875, the charges cannot prosper [9].

The decision of the Court of Industrial Relations is **REVERSED**, and the charges of unfair labor practice are **DISMISSED** [13].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Concepcion and Barrera took no part, and Justice Reyes, J.B.L., reserved his vote [13].
