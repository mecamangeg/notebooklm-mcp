I. CAPTION
JOHN O. YU v. MAXIMO DE LARA, JUAN PANLILIO, LUCIA RIVERO, FLORENTINO ROQUE and DOMINGO SAMSON, G.R. No. L-16084, November 30, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
The subject property is a registered lot in Grace Park subdivision, originally owned by Philippine Realty Corporation (PRC). In 1945, several persons settled on the land and built houses without permission. Between 1947 and 1952, the defendants-appellants bought the houses from these original settlers and continued occupying the land without paying rent. On November 28, 1956, Plaintiff-appellee John O. Yu bought the land from PRC and obtained a Transfer Certificate of Title in his name. In February 1957, Yu advised the defendants to vacate within 30 days. Upon their refusal, Yu filed a complaint for unlawful detainer.

The Justice of the Peace Court of Caloocan ruled in favor of Yu. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Pasig Branch) affirmed the decision, ordering defendants to vacate and pay monthly rentals. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that PRC had abandoned the property by failing to take action against them, thereby converting the land into *res nullius*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the registered owner (PRC) lost ownership of the land through abandonment, allowing defendants to acquire it by occupation.
2. W/N the action for unlawful detainer was the proper remedy despite the lack of a prior contract between the parties.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that abandonment requires not only physical relinquishment of the thing but also a clear intention not to reclaim or reassume ownership. Furthermore, abandonment which converts a thing into *res nullius* (ownership of which may be acquired by occupation) can hardly apply to land, as Article 714 of the Civil Code states that this mode of acquisition is not available for land. Additionally, the subject property is registered land, and under Section 46 of Act No. 496, no title in derogation of the registered owner shall be acquired by prescription or adverse possession. The defendants were merely squatters whose occupancy was at the owner's sufferance.

2. **YES.** A person who occupies the land of another at the latter's tolerance or permission, without any contract between them, is necessarily bound by an implied promise that he will vacate upon demand. Failure to do so makes a summary action for ejectment the proper remedy.

The judgment appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
