**I. CAPTION**
ISABEL V. SAGUINSIN vs. DIONISIO LINDAYAG, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17759, December 17, 1962, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Maria V. Lindayag died intestate in 1959. Her sister, petitioner Isabel V. Saguinsin, filed a petition for the issuance of letters of administration, alleging that the decedent's surviving heirs were her husband (respondent Dionisio Lindayag) and her sisters [1].

Dionisio Lindayag moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that Isabel lacked interest in the estate. He alleged that Maria was survived by him and three legally adopted minor children, excluding Isabel as an heir [2]. He attached a certified copy of the adoption decree to the motion [2]. Isabel opposed, arguing that the court should only consider the facts alleged in her petition—which did not mention the adopted children—in determining the motion's sufficiency [3].

The Court of First Instance of Zambales admitted the evidence of adoption and dismissed the petition, ruling that Isabel was not an heir and had no interest in the estate [3]. Isabel appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petitioner sister is an "interested person" qualified to file a petition for letters of administration.
2. W/N the trial court properly considered evidence outside the petition (the adoption decree) in resolving the motion to dismiss.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The petitioner is not an "interested person." Under Section 2, Rule 80 of the Rules of Court, a petition for letters of administration must be filed by an interested person [4]. An interested party is defined as one who would be benefited by the estate, such as an heir, or one who has a claim against the estate, such as a creditor (*Intestate Estate of Julio Magbanwa*) [5]. This interest must be material and direct, not merely indirect or contingent (*Trillana v. Crisostomo*) [5]. Since it was established that the deceased was survived by a husband and three legally adopted children, the petitioner sister is not an heir and thus lacks any material interest in the estate [6].

2. **YES.** The trial court correctly considered the evidence. The rule that a motion to dismiss must be determined solely on the facts alleged in the complaint or petition applies only when the motion is based on the failure to state a cause of action [6]. However, when the motion is grounded on the petitioner's lack of legal capacity to institute proceedings, the hearing should be conducted as an ordinary hearing where parties are allowed to present evidence (*Asejo v. Leonoso*) [6].

The Order appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
