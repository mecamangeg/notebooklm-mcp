**I. CAPTION**
**IN THE PETITION FOR NATURALIZATION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP OF CUAKI TAN SI. CUAKI TAN SI v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-18006, October 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Cuaki Tan Si filed a petition for naturalization, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Davao [1, 2]. The Provincial Fiscal appealed the decision. While the Solicitor General initially manifested that the petitioner appeared qualified and suggested withdrawing the appeal, the Supreme Court resolved to treat said manifestation as the appellant's brief and reviewed the case on the merits [2]. Upon review, the Court examined the competency of the petitioner's character witnesses, Gregorio S. Romero and Celestino Ceniza. Romero admitted he could not state whether the petitioner believed in the necessity of violence or assassination for the success of ideas [3]. Ceniza, on the other hand, did not know the petitioner's religion or the names of some of his children, and had a limited understanding of the petitioner's political principles [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the character witnesses were competent to vouch for the petitioner's qualifications for naturalization.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court ruled that naturalization is a privilege of the most discriminating nature, not a right, and requires strict compliance with the law [5]. Under Section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, character witnesses must not be mere acquaintances but must possess intimate knowledge of the applicant to competently testify that he has *all* the requisite qualifications and *none* of the statutory disqualifications [6, 7]. Witnesses act as "insurers of the character of the candidate" [8, 9].

In this case, the witnesses failed this standard. Witness Romero could not vouch for the petitioner's stance on violence and assassination, while witness Ceniza lacked basic knowledge of the petitioner's personal life (religion, children) and political beliefs [3, 4]. Consequently, they were deemed incompetent to vouch for the petitioner's fitness for citizenship [10].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the petition is **DISMISSED** [10].
