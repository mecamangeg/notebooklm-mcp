I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. TEODORO ABLOG, G.R. No. L-15310, October 31, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of June 13, 1958, Luis Abigania was sleeping in his house in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, when he was killed by three shots fired from underneath the bamboo slat floor [1]. Prosecution witnesses Cornelio and Eugenio Abigania identified the brothers Santos and Teodoro Ablog as the assailants they saw under the house carrying guns immediately after the firing [2], [3]. Santos had a motive as he had been previously accused of killing the victim's brother [3]. The Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur found Santos guilty as principal and the accused-appellant Teodoro as an accomplice to murder [4]. Santos withdrew his appeal, while Teodoro appealed, raising the defense of alibi and questioning the credibility of witnesses due to discrepancies between their affidavits and court testimonies [5], [6], [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the discrepancies between the witnesses' sworn statements and their testimonies affect their credibility.
2. W/N the accused-appellant should be held liable as a principal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that discrepancies relating to minor details (e.g., whether a witness jumped out a window or went down the stairs) do not affect credibility [7]. This is especially true considering the "shock, excitement and haste" under which the witnesses were laboring when they executed their statements on the very night of the occurrence [8], [9]. The defense of alibi cannot prevail over positive identification [10].

2. **NO.** The Court held the appellant liable only as an accomplice. While his presence at the scene armed with a gun indicated knowledge of his brother's criminal intent, conspiracy was not expressly proven, and it was unlikely that shots were fired from two different guns given the wound trajectories [11], [12]. The Court applied the principle laid down in *People v. Ubiña*, stating that "when doubt exists as to whether a person acted as principal or accomplice, the court should favor the milder liability" [13], [12].

The judgment is affirmed with modification imposing a penalty of from six (6) years and one (1) day of *prisión mayor* to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of *reclusión temporal* [14].
