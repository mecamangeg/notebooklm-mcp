I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. POLICARPIO TIONGSON Y GARCIA and MAURICIO NAVARRO Y ORDILLO, G.R. Nos. L-15201 and L-15202, October 31, 1962, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On the morning of October 19, 1958, the body of William Co Chi Chay was found inside the Champion Watch and Jewelry Store in Manila, having died from skull fractures caused by a monkey wrench [1, 2]. Approximately 67 watches were missing [3]. Defendants Policarpio Tiongson and Mauricio Navarro were arrested; Tiongson in Cavite and Navarro in Cabanatuan City [2, 3]. Both executed extrajudicial confessions admitting participation but blaming the other for the actual killing [2, 3]. The prosecution also presented the testimony of Salvador Villaveles, the hired driver and co-conspirator, who detailed the conspiracy and commission of the crime [4].

The Court of First Instance of Manila convicted Tiongson and Navarro of robbery with homicide with the aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation, treachery, and abuse of confidence, sentencing them to death [5]. The case was elevated for compulsory review. The defendants claimed their confessions were obtained through force and intimidation, raised the defense of alibi, and questioned the credibility of the co-conspirator's testimony [6]. During the appeal, Tiongson filed a motion for new trial based on an affidavit by Villaveles recanting his testimony [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the extrajudicial confessions of the accused were freely made.
2. W/N the testimony of a co-conspirator is entitled to credence.
3. W/N a new trial should be granted based on a co-conspirator's affidavit of recantation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The confessions were freely made. The Court reasoned that the confessions contained details the police could not have possibly supplied or invented, and the declarants attempted to blame one another for the killing [8, 9]. Furthermore, the confessions were explained to the accused before signing, and claims of maltreatment were unsubstantiated [9, 10].

2. **YES.** While testimony from a co-conspirator must be accepted with caution, the Court is justified in giving it credit if no part thereof has been shown to be false [11, 12]. In this case, Villaveles' testimony in open court merely confirmed his earlier confession and sufficiently established the conspiracy [4, 7].

3. **NO.** The Court denied the motion for new trial. It held that affidavits of recantation by convicts are inherently untrustworthy as they come from individuals who have nothing or not much to lose by recanting previous testimony given under oath [7, 11, 12].

The decisions of the lower court sentencing the defendants to death are **AFFIRMED** [5, 13].
