I. CAPTION
FINDLAY MILLAR TIMBER COMPANY v. PHILIPPINE LAND-AIR-SEA LABOR UNION (PLASLU) and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. Nos. L-18217 and L-18222, September 29, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Findlay Millar Timber Company (Petitioner) entered into a collective bargaining agreement containing a closed-shop clause with the Western Lanao Labor Union (WELLU). Consequently, the Company dismissed several employees who were members of the Philippine Land-Air-Sea Labor Union (PLASLU) because they refused to disaffiliate from PLASLU and join WELLU [1, 2]. PLASLU filed unfair labor practice charges against the Company.

The Trial Judge of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) dismissed the charges, ruling that the dismissals were justified. Relying on American jurisprudence, the Trial Judge held that the closed-shop provision validly applied to both new hires and old employees already in the service [3, 4]. On appeal, the CIR *en banc* reversed the Trial Judge, ordering the reinstatement of the dismissed employees with back wages, citing that closed-shop agreements should not affect old employees [3, 5]. The Company petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing it acted in good faith reliance on the closed-shop agreement and prevailing jurisprudence [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the closed-shop agreement justifies the dismissal of employees already in the service who are members of another union.
2. W/N the dismissed employees are entitled to back wages.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A closed-shop agreement applies only to persons to be hired or to employees who are not yet members of any labor organization [7]. It is inapplicable to those already in the service who are members of another union. Citing *Freeman Shirt Manufacturing Co., Inc. v. Court of Industrial Relations*, the Court held that compelling employees to disaffiliate from their minority union to join the contracting union would render nugatory the right to self-organization guaranteed by the Industrial Peace Act [7, 8].

2. **NO.** The employees are not entitled to back wages because the Company acted in good faith [9]. At the time of the dismissals, the prevailing view based on American jurisprudence—which is persuasive in this jurisdiction—was that closed-shop agreements applied to all employees [6]. Since the Company acted pursuant to a reasonable interpretation of the law before the *Freeman* doctrine was promulgated, it should not be penalized.

The decision of the CIR is **MODIFIED**. The employees are ordered reinstated but **without back wages** [10].
