I. CAPTION
RIZAL CEMENT WORKERS UNION (FFW) v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and RIZAL CEMENT CO., INC., G.R. No. L-18442, November 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On September 2, 1954, petitioner Rizal Cement Workers Union (Union) sent collective bargaining proposals to respondent Rizal Cement Co., Inc. (Company), which the Company refused to entertain due to a pending case. On May 27, 1956, the Union declared a strike at the Company’s plant in Binangonan, Rizal [1]. The President of the Philippines certified the dispute to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [1]. The CIR found the strike justified, noting it was against unfair labor practices, but observed that it was attended by isolated acts of violence [2, 3]. Consequently, the CIR ordered the reinstatement of the strikers but did not award back wages [4]. The Union appealed, arguing that the Company’s refusal to accept their unconditional offer to return to work during the pendency of the dispute constituted a "lockout" or "virtual lockout" under Section 15 of Republic Act No. 875, entitling them to back wages [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the strikers are entitled to back wages on the ground that the Company’s refusal to accept them back constituted a lockout.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the Union is not entitled to back wages. The "lockout" referred to in Section 15 of Republic Act No. 875 is that committed by an employer who refuses to give work to its workers [7]. A strike openly declared by a union cannot be converted into a "pure and simple lockout" or a "virtual lockout" (which the law does not recognize) merely by filing a notice of offer to return to work during the pendency of the labor dispute [6, 8].

Furthermore, since the dispute was certified by the President, the CIR exercised broad arbitration powers under Commonwealth Act No. 103 [9]. This authority allows the CIR to fix terms of employment, including reinstatement "with or without back wages" [9]. Given the isolated acts of violence committed by strikers, the denial of back wages was based on reason and fairness, placing the parties in a position where "one gained none for the fault of the other" [10].

The petition is dismissed, and the decision affirmed [11].
