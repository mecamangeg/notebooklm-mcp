I. CAPTION
NARCEO SAMBRANO and/or MAURA TRANSIT CO., INC. v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION and PHILIPPINE RABBIT BUS LINES, INC., G.R. No. L-18459, September 29, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On August 23, 1960, petitioners Narceo Sambrano and Maura Transit Co., Inc. filed a complaint with the Public Service Commission (PSC) seeking the cancellation of three certificates of public convenience consolidated in the name of respondent Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc. [1]. Petitioners alleged that respondent's predecessor-in-interest, the Estate of Florencio P. Buan, had abandoned and failed to operate the lines since 1956, and that respondent only began operations in July 1960 [2].

Respondent invoked Section 28 of the Public Service Act, arguing that violations of certificate conditions prescribe after 60 days [2, 3]. The PSC ruled that petitioners could only present evidence regarding violations committed by the respondent itself (excluding the predecessor) and limited such evidence to violations committed within the 60 days immediately preceding the filing of the complaint [4]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Supreme Court challenging this restriction [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioners may prove abandonment and non-user committed outside the 60-day prescriptive period provided in Section 28 of the Public Service Act.
2. W/N the respondent operator is answerable for the abandonment and non-user committed by its predecessor-in-interest.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the 60-day prescriptive period fixed by Section 28 of the Public Service Act is available as a defense only in criminal or penal proceedings filed under Chapter IV of the Act [5]. Proceedings for the cancellation or modification of a certificate are not penal in character; they are primarily intended to ensure adequate service and protect the public [5]. Therefore, the PSC is not barred from receiving evidence of prescribed violations to determine if the operator has faithfully kept the conditions of the permit [5].

2. **NO.** In proceedings for cancellation under Section 16(m) of the Public Service Act, a public service operator cannot be held answerable for its predecessor’s violations which were not made of record or brought to the attention of the PSC within the 60-day period or at the hearing for the approval of the transfer [6]. The Court reasoned that it would be inequitable to make a purchaser answerable for violations it had no notice of and could not ascertain from the records [6].

The order appealed from is **MODIFIED**. The PSC is ordered to admit evidence of violations committed by Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc. even if not filed within 60 days, but the exclusion of proof regarding the predecessor's violations is **AFFIRMED** [7].
