I. CAPTION
WENCESLAO PLAZA, MANUEL SABERON, ARTURO BERNARDINO, ET AL. v. THE HON. JUDGE EULOGIO MENCIAS and FILIPINAS MOTOR SERVICES, INC., G.R. No. L-18253, October 31, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, members of the PAFLU union, served bargaining demands on respondent Filipinas Motor Services, Inc. (FILMOCO) on March 17, 1961. Following this, FILMOCO severed the employment of over 20 union members. On March 20, petitioners staged a strike and filed unfair labor practice charges with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). On March 22, FILMOCO filed a complaint for damages with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, claiming petitioners were independent contractors and not employees. Respondent Judge Mencias issued a restraining order against the petitioners on March 23. Petitioners filed an "Urgent Motion for Reconsideration" on March 24 alleging the CFI lacked jurisdiction due to the pending labor dispute. However, on March 27, before the CFI could resolve the motion, petitioners filed the present petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioners are independent contractors due to the stipulations in their contracts.
2. W/N the petition for certiorari was prematurely filed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioners are employees, not independent contractors. The mere statement in a contract with a company that laborers paid according to the amount and quality of work are independent contractors does not change their status as mere employees in contemplation of the labor laws [1, 2]. Since they are employees involved in a labor dispute, the matter falls within the jurisdiction of the CIR, not the CFI.

2. **YES, but the petition was granted.** The general rule is that before a petition for certiorari can be brought, all available remedies, such as a motion for reconsideration, must be exhausted [3, 4]. While the Court found the objection that the petition was premature to be well-taken, it held that dismissing the petition to remand the case to the CFI to decide the pending motion would only result in a waste of considerable time and expense to no avail [5].

Petition granted; the preliminary injunction of the lower court is set aside [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Padilla, J., took no part.
