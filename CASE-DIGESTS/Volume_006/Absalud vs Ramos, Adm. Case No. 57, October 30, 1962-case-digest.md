**I. CAPTION**
HERMENEGILDO U. ABSALUD v. HON. EUSEBIO F. RAMOS, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Occidental Mindoro, Adm. Case No. 57, October 30, 1962, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
In November 1958, complainant Hermenegildo Absalud filed an administrative complaint against respondent Judge Eusebio F. Ramos of the Court of First Instance of Occidental Mindoro [1]. The charges alleged malversation through falsification of public documents, serious misconduct, and inefficiency in office [1]. The Supreme Court referred the matter to Associate Justice Eugenio Angeles of the Court of Appeals for investigation [1]. After conducting an investigation, Justice Angeles submitted a report recommending the respondent's exoneration, finding that the respondent had satisfactorily explained his side regarding the malversation charge and that there was no substantial evidence to support the charges of serious misconduct and inefficiency [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the administrative charges against the respondent Judge should be dismissed for lack of merit.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court agreed with the investigative report of Justice Angeles that the complainant failed to make out a good case against the respondent [2]. The Court held that there was a want of substantial evidence to support the charges of malversation, serious misconduct, and inefficiency [3, 4]. Additionally, noting that Judge Ramos had already retired, the Court deemed it unnecessary to discuss the matter extensively [2].

Administrative Case No. 57 was dismissed without pronouncement as to costs [2].
