I. CAPTION
ANTONIO E. QUEROL v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-16705, October 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On February 28, 1948, petitioner Antonio Querol filed his income tax return for 1947 [1]. In 1951, the respondent Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) issued an assessment charging Querol for disallowed repair expenses which he had claimed as deductions [1]. On December 14, 1951, Querol requested a reconsideration of the assessment, which he reiterated in a subsequent letter in 1953 [1]. Following a reinvestigation, the CIR issued a revised assessment on February 9, 1955, reducing the tax liability to P753.51 [2].

In September 1956, the CIR issued a warrant of distraint and levy, prompting Querol to file a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) to nullify the warrant [3]. The CTA ruled that the right to collect summarily had prescribed but later modified the decision upon Querol's amended petition [3, 4]. Querol appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the CIR’s right to collect the 1947 deficiency had prescribed because the 1955 revised assessment and subsequent collection efforts were made beyond the five-year period from the filing of the return in 1948 [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the government's right to collect the deficiency income tax for 1947 has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the collection of the tax had not prescribed.

First, the original assessment in 1951 was issued well within the five-year period from the filing of the return in 1948 [6]. Second, the revised assessment issued on February 9, 1955, was the result of the petitioner’s own requests for reconsideration [7]. The Court applied the principle that the period between the petition for reconsideration and the issuance of the revised assessment should be subtracted from the total prescriptive period (*Republic vs. Ablaza*) [7].

Furthermore, once an assessment is reconsidered at the taxpayer's instance, the five-year period for filing a court action for collection begins to run from the date of the reconsidered or modified assessment (*Collector vs. Pineda*) [8]. In this case, the judicial action to collect was deemed instituted when the CIR filed his answer to the amended petition in April 1959, which was less than five years after the revised assessment was issued in February 1955 [8]. Finally, prescription is a matter of defense, and the burden is on the taxpayer to prove that the full period of limitation has expired [9].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [9].
