I. CAPTION
STOCKHOLDERS OF F. GUANZON AND SONS, INC. v. REGISTER OF DEEDS OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-18216, October 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On September 19, 1960, the five stockholders of F. Guanzon and Sons, Inc. executed a certificate of liquidation recitating that, following a resolution to dissolve the corporation, they had distributed the corporation's assets, including real properties in Manila, among themselves in proportion to their shareholdings [2]. When the certificate was presented to the Register of Deeds of Manila, registration was denied on several grounds, specifically requiring the payment of P430.50 in registration fees and P940.45 in documentary stamps, and a statement of the number of parcels in the acknowledgment [3]. The stockholders appealed via *consulta* to the Commissioner of Land Registration, arguing that the certificate was merely a distribution of assets of a dissolved entity, not a conveyance or transfer [4, 5]. The Commissioner sustained the Register of Deeds' requirements, ruling that the certificate involved a transfer [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a certificate of liquidation distributing corporate assets to stockholders is considered a transfer or conveyance requiring documentary stamps and registration fees. [4]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the act of liquidation is not a partition of community property but a transfer or conveyance of title from the corporation to the individual stockholders [6]. A stockholder is not a co-owner or tenant in common of corporate property [6]. Since the purpose of the liquidation and distribution is to transfer title from the corporation to the stockholders, such transfer cannot be effected without a corresponding deed of conveyance [6]. Therefore, the certificate of liquidation is in the nature of a transfer or conveyance and is subject to the corresponding fees and stamps [6].

The Resolution of the Land Registration Commission is **AFFIRMED** [7].
