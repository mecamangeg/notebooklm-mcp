I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR NATURALIZATION, CHUNG HONG alias JOSE VILLANUEVA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17391, November 29, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On March 19, 1956, Chung Hong filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Catanduanes. The CFI initially granted the petition but, upon the Provincial Fiscal's motion for reconsideration, reversed its ruling and denied the petition. The denial was based on the petitioner's failure to prove that his children of school age had finished secondary education, which was necessary to exempt him from filing a declaration of intention. Petitioner appealed, moving to remand the case to introduce additional evidence regarding his children's schooling.

During the appeal review, the Supreme Court found that the petitioner admitted to never registering two of his children (Herminia and Leo) with the Bureau of Immigration and only registered his other minor children in August 1958, after the naturalization petition had already been filed. Furthermore, while the petitioner claimed to own property worth P10,000 inherited from his father, the tax declaration submitted was in his wife's name alone and assessed at only P2,020.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the case should be reopened to allow the petitioner to introduce additional evidence regarding his exemption from filing a declaration of intention.
2. W/N the petitioner’s failure to strictly comply with the Alien Registration Act disqualifies him from naturalization.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held there is no reason for reopening the case because there was no adequate excuse for the petitioner's failure to prove facts at the trial that were well known to him from the start [1]. Furthermore, the reception of such evidence would be an "empty ceremony" because other fatal grounds existed to deny the application [2].

2. **YES.** The petitioner failed to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner. The Court ruled that the failure to register his wife and children with the Bureau of Immigration as required by the Alien Registration Act constitutes a failure to conduct oneself in a "proper and irreproachable manner" in relation to the government [3, 4]. Citing *Benjamin Co v. Republic*, the Court emphasized that this questionable conduct is fatal to the petition [2, 4]. Additionally, the Court noted grave doubts regarding his property qualification, as the documentary evidence contradicted his testimony and failed to meet the statutory P5,000 requirement [5].

The denial of the petition for naturalization is AFFIRMED.
