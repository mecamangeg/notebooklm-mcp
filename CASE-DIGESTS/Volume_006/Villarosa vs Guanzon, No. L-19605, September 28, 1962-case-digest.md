I. CAPTION
AUGUSTO R. VILLAROSA v. ROMEO G. GUANZON, G.R. No. L-19605, September 28, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
In the November 10, 1959 general elections for Vice Mayor of Bacolod City, Romeo Guanzon was proclaimed the winner with 9,678 votes against Augusto Villarosa’s 9,162 votes [1]. Villarosa filed an election protest with the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental. After trial, the lower court rejected 586 ballots but Guanzon retained a majority of 47 votes, leading to the dismissal of the protest [2].

Villarosa appealed directly to the Supreme Court on a question of law, contending that the lower court erred in validating 127 ballots in Precinct No. 55 [3]. These ballots contained names of candidates written as a surname accompanied by the first syllable of the Christian name (e.g., "Quimson SOF", "Tañada LOR", "Lopez FER") [4, 5]. Although the lower court described these as "marked," it refused to invalidate them, reasoning that there was no evidence showing the marks were intended to identify the voters [3, 6]. Villarosa argued that the identical manner of writing constituted distinguishing marks placed by the voters for identification [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the 127 ballots containing surnames accompanied by the first syllable of the candidates' Christian names should be rejected as marked ballots.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision to count the ballots. The Court held that while the circumstance that several voters wrote names in an identical manner (surname plus first syllable) may indicate a preconceived plan, such an inference cannot be justified based on what is written on the ballots alone [9]. There must be **evidence *aliunde*** (external evidence) clearly showing that the writing was part of a scheme to identify the voters [9, 10].

The Court cited the rule that identification marks cannot be presumed but must be established by clear evidence (*Jaucian v. Callos*) [9]. Furthermore, Paragraph 18, Section 149 of the Election Law explicitly states that "the first letters or syllables of names which the voter does not continue" shall be considered innocent and shall not invalidate the ballot unless it clearly appears they were deliberately put to serve as identification marks [9]. Absent positive proof to the contrary, such signs are presumed accidental [11].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision appealed from is affirmed, and the election of protestee Romeo Guanzon as vice mayor of the City of Bacolod is confirmed [10].
