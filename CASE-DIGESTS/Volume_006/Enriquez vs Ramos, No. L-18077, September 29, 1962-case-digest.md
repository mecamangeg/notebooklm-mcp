I. CAPTION
RODRIGO ENRIQUEZ, ET AL. v. SOCORRO A. RAMOS, G.R. No. L-18077, September 29, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On November 24, 1958, plaintiffs Enriquez et al. sold 20 parcels of land in Quezon City to defendant Ramos. The deed of sale with mortgage stated a purchase price of P235,056.00, with P35,056.00 paid down and the balance of P200,000.00 payable within two years [1]. When Ramos failed to pay the stipulated amount in the first year, Enriquez instituted an action for foreclosure of the mortgage [1].

Ramos admitted the non-payment but raised the affirmative defense that the written contract did not express the true intent of the parties [2]. She alleged a contemporaneous oral agreement where Enriquez promised to construct roads in the subdivision by January 1959, a condition omitted from the deed upon counsel's advice that it was a "superfluity" due to existing city ordinances [2]. She further claimed the true price was only P185,000.00, and the P50,000.00 difference was her contribution to the road construction [3]. The trial court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the road construction was a condition precedent to Ramos' obligation, and since plaintiffs failed to perform, the action was premature [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N parole evidence is admissible to prove the oral agreement regarding road construction.
2. W/N the action for foreclosure is premature.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the Parole Evidence Rule (Section 22, Rule 123 of the Rules of Court) barring evidence of terms outside the written agreement applies only if there is no allegation that the agreement does not express the true intent of the parties [4], [5]. Since Ramos specifically pleaded in her answer that the deed failed to express the true intent regarding the road construction, parole evidence was admissible [6]. The Court gave credence to the "Explanation" (Exhibit 3), a document executed on the same day as the sale, which stated the P50,000.00 difference was Ramos' contribution for roads the plaintiffs assumed to undertake [7], [8].

2. **YES.** The construction of roads was a condition precedent to the enforcement of the contract [6]. In a subdivision, feeder roads are a main improvement necessary to make the land accessible and valuable [9]. Because Enriquez et al. failed to comply with this condition precedent, they had no cause of action to foreclose the mortgage.

The decision of the lower court is AFFIRMED [10].
