**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ESMAEL SUSUKAN, G.R. No. L-18030, October 31, 1962, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
On the afternoon of February 16, 1958, in Siasi, Sulu, Amilhamja Asaali (the deceased), a public school teacher, was walking on a trail with a group. Esmael Susukan (the accused), who was physically larger and armed with a bigger weapon than Amilhamja, was following behind in another group [1, 2]. Upon reaching a coconut grove, Susukan attacked Amilhamja, inflicting fatal wounds on the right side of the head, top of the head, and the back of the neck [1]. Susukan claimed self-defense, alleging that Amilhamja provoked him and that the injuries occurred during a face-to-face fight [3]. The Court of First Instance of Sulu rejected this defense, found Susukan guilty of murder, and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* [4, 5]. Susukan appealed the decision [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the accused acted in self-defense.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, holding that the physical evidence and circumstances belied the accused's claim of a face-to-face fight [6]. The Court relied on the following factors: (1) the fatal wounds were located at the back of the neck and the right side of the head, indicating an attack from behind; (2) the accused's alleged wounds were merely skin-deep and were only examined a month after the incident; and (3) it was improbable that the deceased, a teacher with a smaller build and inferior weapon, would unprovokedly attack a larger, better-armed adversary [2, 7, 8]. Eyewitness testimony confirmed that the accused suddenly ran from behind to hack the victim [8].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed *in toto* [9].
