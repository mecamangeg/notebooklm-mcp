I. CAPTION
GLICERIA RAMOS, ET AL. v. JULIA CARIÑO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17429, October 31, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Gaspar Ramos and Angela de Guzman owned three parcels of land in San Jacinto, Pangasinan. They had two children, plaintiff Gliceria Ramos and the deceased Alejandro Ramos (husband of defendant Julia Cariño). After the parents died, Alejandro and subsequently his widow Julia administered the properties, delivering Gliceria’s share of the products until 1948. In 1949, Julia stopped delivering the shares, claiming sole ownership. Gliceria filed a complaint for recovery of her share, alleging that the donation of the lands by Angela to Alejandro in 1940 was void and inofficious as it impaired her legitime.

Evidence showed Angela donated the first two parcels to Alejandro in 1940, leading to the issuance of a new title in his name. Julia, with court authority, later sold these lots to Estefania Sonday and intervenor Maximo Mejia. Intervenor Rufino Mejia claimed the third parcel via a sale from Alejandro in 1943. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan dismissed the action, ruling that the purchasers were in good faith and the plaintiff failed to prove the donation was inofficious.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the donation made by Angela de Guzman to Alejandro Ramos was inofficious.
2. W/N the purchasers of the properties (Sonday and Mejia) were in bad faith.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the plaintiff failed to prove that the properties donated were the only assets of the donor, Angela de Guzman, at the time of her death or the donation. Under Articles 750 and 752 of the Civil Code, for a donation to be considered inofficious and detrimental to a forced heir's rights, it must be proven that the value of the donated property exceeds the value of the free portion plus the donee’s share in the donor's estate. The plaintiff failed to present such proof.

2. **NO.** The two properties were sold to Sonday and Maximo Mejia, who hold certificates of title in their names. The plaintiff submitted no evidence that they acquired the lots in bad faith. Consequently, good faith is presumed under Article 527 of the Civil Code, and their titles are valid. Regarding the third parcel, the plaintiff failed to prove it belonged to her parents or that its transfer was inofficious.

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED**.
