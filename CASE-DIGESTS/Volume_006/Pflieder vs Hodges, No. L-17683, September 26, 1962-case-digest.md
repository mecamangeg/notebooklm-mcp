I. CAPTION
WILLIAM C. PFLIEDER v. C.N. HODGES, G.R. No. L-17683, September 26, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant-appellee C.N. Hodges filed a motion to dismiss the appeal of plaintiff-appellant William C. Pflieder. Hodges argued that the order denying Pflieder's motion for relief from judgment was not appealable because the period for appeal, counted from the date of the notice of the original decision (a judgment by default), had already expired. Hodges contended that since the original judgment had become final due to the lapse of the 30-day appeal period, the subsequent order denying relief could no longer be appealed [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an order denying a motion for relief from judgment is appealable even after the original judgment has become final.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the general rule is that all judgments or orders that are final are appealable [2]. While the original judgment by default had indeed become final upon the expiration of the 30-day appeal period, Rule 38 allows for the filing of a motion for relief [3].

The Court ruled that an order denying a motion for relief based on excusable neglect is final in character because it puts an end to the ordinary proceeding of the case in court [4, 5]. Therefore, under Section 2, Rule 41, such an order is appealable [3, 5]. The Court cited *Monteverde v. Jaramilla* (60 Phil. 297) and *Rios v. Ros* (79 Phil. 243), establishing that certiorari does not lie against such an order precisely because the remedy of appeal is available [4, 6].

Consequently, the motion to dismiss the appeal was **DENIED** [7].
