I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR NATURALIZATION TO BECOME CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. ANTONIO GO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18068, October 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Antonio Go filed a petition for naturalization, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Misamis Oriental. The Republic appealed the decision, challenging the competency and credibility of Go's character witnesses (Governor De Lara and Henry Canoy) and Go's qualifications regarding lucrative income and moral character.

Governor De Lara testified on Go's personal data based on hearsay and contradicted documentary evidence regarding Go's schooling (claiming public instead of private) and employment status (claiming partner instead of employee). Go claimed to earn P120.00 to P200.00 monthly with free board and lodging, but his residence certificates and school records identified him merely as a student. He also admitted he would stop working to study medicine in Manila and had not paid income tax or Residence Tax Class B.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner's character witnesses are credible and competent.
2. W/N the petitioner satisfies the requirement of a lucrative trade or occupation.
3. W/N the petitioner possesses the requisite moral character.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under the Revised Naturalization Law, character witnesses must be "credible persons," meaning they must have good standing in the community, be known as honest and upright, and be reputed as trustworthy and reliable, such that their word acts as a warranty of the petitioner's worthiness [1]. Governor De Lara lacked sufficient personal knowledge of the petitioner, residing 150 kilometers away and contradicting record evidence regarding the petitioner's education and employment status [2]. The record also failed to affirmatively show that witness Henry Canoy met the standard required to act as an "insurer" of the applicant's character [1], [3].

2. **NO.** A monthly salary of P200.00, even with free board and lodging, is not sufficient to satisfy the "lucrative trade or occupation" requirement of Section 2, paragraph 4, of the Revised Naturalization Law, particularly in view of the reduced purchasing power of the Philippine currency [3]. The Court cited *Koa Gui v. Republic* and *Tan v. Republic* to support this threshold. Furthermore, the petitioner's employment was not stable, as he intended to stop working to study medicine [3].

3. **NO.** The petitioner's moral character and veracity were found to be of a dubious nature. His testimony regarding employment and income was directly contradicted by his residence certificates and school records, which listed him as a student [4]. Additionally, his Declaration of Intention claimed he was "engaged in business operation," contradicting his court testimony that he was merely an employee. His failure to pay income tax or Residence Tax Class B further undermined the truthfulness of his alleged income [4].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DISMISSED** [5].
