I. CAPTION
PILAR GREGORIO and PACIFICO TUASON v. THE HONORABLE EULOGIO MENCIAS and MERCEDES N. DE RELUCIO, G.R. No. L-16227, September 29, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Mercedes N. de Relucio (Relucio) leased two fishponds in the Loñgos Estate to Pilar Gregorio (Gregorio) for a period of four years, expiring on August 5, 1956. Upon expiration, Gregorio refused to vacate, claiming she was authorized by the Land Tenure Administration (LTA) to possess the lots. Relucio filed an unlawful detainer case in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Malabon, which ruled in her favor. Gregorio and her husband appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal (Judge Mencias). The appeal was perfected on July 29, 1957. On September 2, 1957, Relucio filed a motion for a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction under Article 1674 of the Civil Code to recover possession pending appeal. Gregorio opposed, arguing the motion was filed beyond the 10-day period prescribed by law (counting from the perfection of appeal) and that her appeal was meritorious due to her LTA lease application. The CFI granted the injunction. Gregorio filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the motion for preliminary mandatory injunction was filed within the reglementary period under Art. 1674 of the Civil Code.
2. W/N the CFI Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in granting the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The motion was timely filed. Although Article 1674 of the Civil Code states the 10-day period shall be counted from the time the appeal is perfected, the Supreme Court ruled that this period should be counted from the date the petitioning party is **notified** of the perfection of the appeal. Relucio had not yet received notice of the appeal when she filed her motion. A literal interpretation would render the remedy unavailing, as records are often transmitted to the appellate court late, and the appellee is not expected to constantly check the lower court's records (*De la Cruz v. Bocar*).

2. **NO.** The Judge did not abuse his discretion. The issuance of the writ in ejectment cases is vested in the appellate court to prevent lessees from unduly prolonging possession. The Court found the appeal frivolous and dilatory. Petitioners could not deny the title of their lessor (Relucio) or assert an adverse right based on a lease application with the LTA, as the LTA bond was approved only after the ejectment case had already been filed (Art. 1436, New Civil Code; Sec. 68-b, Rule 123, Rules of Court).

The petition is dismissed, and the orders of the respondent Judge are affirmed.
