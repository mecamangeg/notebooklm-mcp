I. CAPTION
CASIANO U. LAPUT v. FRANCISCO E.F. REMOTIGUE, Adm. Case No. 434, September 29, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Casiano U. Laput was the former counsel for the estate of Barrera in Special Proceedings No. 2-J (CFI Cebu). Despite being discharged by the administratrix in January 1955 and ordered by the court in October 1957 to surrender documents and certificates of title belonging to the estate, Laput refused to do so, claiming an attorney’s lien for the balance of his fees [1-3].

Respondent Francisco E.F. Remotigue, the new counsel for the administratrix, filed motions in court praying for Laput to surrender the titles and subsequently petitioned for the issuance of new owner’s duplicate copies alleging the titles were lost [1]. Laput filed this administrative complaint charging Remotigue with malice, bad faith, and unethical practices for filing said motions without notice to him and for misrepresenting the loss of the titles [1, 4]. The Solicitor General investigated and found that Laput had already collected the majority of his fees and was stubbornly retaining the titles despite court orders [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N respondent is guilty of unethical conduct for filing motions without notice to the former counsel regarding the surrender of titles.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court approved the Solicitor General’s recommendation to exonerate the respondent [6]. There was no malice or bad faith on the part of the respondent. The record showed that the administratrix had long discharged the complainant and requested the turnover of records, which the complainant "stubbornly" refused to do despite a court order [5]. Consequently, the filing of motions by the new counsel to secure the certificates of title, even without notice to the former counsel who refused to surrender them, did not constitute unethical conduct [6, 7]. The administrative case was dismissed [8].
