I. CAPTION
**CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, and AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS, INC. v. ALFREDO CAJIGAL, et al. and the HON. DELFIN B. FLORES, Judge of CFI of Ilocos Norte**, G.R. No. L-19278, December 29, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On July 29, 1961, the President authorized Agro-Industrial Products, Inc. (Agro) to purchase low-grade tobacco from ACCFA and import 4.5 million kilos of foreign Virginia leaf tobacco [1, 2]. The Central Bank allocated this importation quota among manufacturers [2].

On July 31, 1961, Adolfo Columbres, representing 5 million tobacco farmers, filed Civil Case No. 47659 in the CFI of Manila to enjoin this importation. The Manila court initially issued a preliminary injunction but later lifted it on November 9, 1961 [3].

Subsequently, on October 10, 1961, Alfredo Cajigal and other farmers—some of whom were also plaintiffs in the Manila case—filed Civil Case No. 3434 in the CFI of Ilocos Norte against Agro, the Central Bank, and the Commissioner of Customs [4]. The complaint raised issues and prayers identical to those in the Manila case [4]. Despite a motion to dismiss filed by the petitioners based on lack of jurisdiction and pendency of the Manila case, respondent Judge Flores of the CFI of Ilocos Norte issued a writ of preliminary injunction on December 1, 1961 [4]. Petitioners filed this action for certiorari [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte has jurisdiction to issue a writ of preliminary injunction against the petitioners to restrain acts committed outside its territorial boundaries.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The respondent court had no jurisdiction to issue said injunction. The Supreme Court ruled that a Court of First Instance cannot issue a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain acts which are being committed or about to be committed outside of the territorial boundaries of its province or district [6, 7]. The Court relied on the doctrine in *Acosta v. Alvendia* (L-14598, Oct. 31, 1960) [6, 7].

Additionally, the Court noted that the Supreme Court had already decided substantially the same issue in previous cases (*Climaco* and *Columbres*), and the plaintiffs in the Ilocos case represented the same interests and cause of action as the parties in the Manila case [1, 8].

The writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Supreme Court (restraining the implementation of the lower court's order) is made permanent [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Barrera, J., concurs in the result [10].
