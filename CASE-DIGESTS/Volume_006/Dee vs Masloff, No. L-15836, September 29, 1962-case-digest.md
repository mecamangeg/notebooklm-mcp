I. CAPTION
APOLINARIO DEE, DEE HONG LUE, YANG SEPENG and DEE K. CHIONG v. IGOR A. MASLOFF, LEOPOLDO D. ALODAGA, ROSARIO CHUA, RIZAL SURETY & INSURANCE CO., and REHABILITATION FINANCE CORPORATION, G.R. Nos. L-15836 and L-16220, September 29, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Apolinario Dee et al. filed a replevin case (Civil Case No. 797) against Igor Masloff et al. to recover a sawmill in Capalonga. The court appointed a receiver, but Masloff secured the discharge of the receivership by filing a counter-bond of P30,000 subscribed by Rizal Surety & Insurance Co. Possession was returned to Masloff.

Separately, Masloff obtained a loan from the predecessor of the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC), mortgaging the sawmill and equipment. He presented tax declarations and certificates of ownership showing he owned the properties. When Masloff defaulted, RFC foreclosed. Plaintiffs filed a separate suit (Civil Case No. 6114) to annul the mortgage, claiming true ownership.

The trial court heard the cases jointly. In Case No. 797, it ordered Masloff to pay P50,000 damages. Upon Plaintiffs' motion—and after Rizal Surety filed an opposition and rejoinder—the court amended the judgment to hold Rizal Surety jointly and severally liable up to P30,000. In Case No. 6114, the court declared the mortgage void and ordered RFC to pay P50,000 damages jointly with Masloff. Rizal Surety appealed, claiming it was denied a hearing on damages. RFC appealed, asserting the validity of the mortgage.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the amended judgment holding the surety liable is valid despite the lack of a separate trial on damages.
2. W/N the chattel mortgage executed by Masloff in favor of RFC is valid despite Plaintiffs' claim of ownership.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The requirement of a hearing was fully satisfied. The amended judgment was rendered only after Rizal Surety was served with the motion to hold it liable. The surety filed an "Opposition" and "Rejoinder" but confined its defense to arguments that it was not a party to the case and that plaintiffs were guilty of laches. It did not put in issue the reasonableness of the damages awarded, nor did it pray for an opportunity to present evidence. Under *Visayan Surety & Insurance Corporation v. Pascual*, if the surety does not contest the reality or reasonableness of the damages, a summary hearing is sufficient. Judgment on the pleadings may be rendered when facts are not specifically denied. The judgment against Rizal Surety is affirmed.

2. **YES.** The mortgage is valid. While Masloff’s representations of ownership may not bind the plaintiffs regarding their internal agreement, they do not bind the RFC. Masloff held proofs of ownership (tax declarations and certificates of registration) when he applied for the loan. The RFC (via its predecessor) relied on these documents and the public records in good faith, with no knowledge of the pending litigation or the plaintiffs' claims. Therefore, the mortgage and subsequent foreclosure sale were legal and valid. Consequently, RFC cannot be held liable for the value of the properties. The judgment against RFC is reversed.
