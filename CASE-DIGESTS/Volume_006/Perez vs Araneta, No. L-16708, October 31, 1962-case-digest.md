**I. CAPTION**
ANTONIO M. PEREZ, judicial guardian-appellant v. J. ANTONIO ARANETA, trustee-appellee, G.R. No. L-16708, October 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
J. Antonio Araneta was the trustee of the property bequeathed by Angela S. Tuason to her grandchildren (the minors Benigno, Angela, and Antonio Perez y Tuason). The will granted Araneta ample powers to sell the trust properties without judicial authorization. In June 1959, Araneta informed Antonio M. Perez, the minors' judicial guardian, of a proposed sale of approximately 42 hectares of land in Marikina to Ortigas & Co. for P2.93 per square meter. Perez objected to the sale, arguing that the price was too low and that the fair market value was P5.00 per square meter, basing his claim on a report citing offers to sell and other transactions in the area. Perez filed a motion for a writ of preliminary injunction to stop the sale, which the lower court denied. Perez appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the agreed price of P2.93 per square meter constitutes the fair market value of the property.
2. W/N the trustee’s exercise of discretion to sell the property should be disturbed by the Court.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court found the price of P2.93 per square meter to be fairly representative of the market value. The appellant's reliance on "offers to sell" to prove a higher value was rejected because offers to sell are not competent evidence of fair market value; they are no better than offers to buy, which are inadmissible (*City of Manila v. Estrada*; *Manila Railroad Co. v. Aguilar*). Furthermore, the other sales cited by the appellant involved much smaller lots or were not in the immediate neighborhood. To be admissible, properties sold must be in the immediate neighborhood or within the zone of commercial activity (*Manila Railroad Co. v. Mitchell*). In contrast, the appellee presented evidence of recent sales of large parcels in the same vicinity at lower rates (P1.50 and P2.50 per square meter).

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the trustee's decision should not be disturbed. The will expressly granted the trustee ample powers, demonstrating the trustor's implicit faith and confidence in his judgment. The rule is that where a trustor relies upon the trustee's judgment and discretion, the exercise thereof should not be disturbed except upon clear proof of fraud, bad faith, or unless the transaction is manifestly prejudicial to the interest of the *cestui que trust*. The appellant failed to prove such prejudice, as claims regarding devaluation and taxes were merely speculative.

The orders appealed from are **AFFIRMED**.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None.
