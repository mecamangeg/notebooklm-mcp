I. CAPTION
LA TONDEÑA, INC. v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-14875, September 29, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner La Tondeña, Inc., a manufacturer of wines and liquors, purchased crude spirits (low test alcohol) from Binalbagan Isabela Company (BISCOM) for rectification between May 21, 1951, and February 26, 1954. During the transport of these spirits from BISCOM to petitioner’s distillery, 6,655 proof liters were lost. Respondent Collector of Internal Revenue assessed petitioner P6,019.30 in specific taxes on the lost alcohol. Petitioner paid under protest and subsequently filed a claim for refund, arguing that under the law then in force, it was not liable for taxes on crude alcohol lost before rectification. The Collector did not act on the claim, prompting petitioner to appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). The CTA dismissed the petition, ruling that because the alcohol was lost in transit and not transformed into a finished product, the tax attached immediately upon removal from the place of production. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner is liable for specific tax on crude alcohol lost in transit intended for rectification under the law applicable at the time (R.A. No. 592).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CTA decision. During the period in question (1951-1954), Republic Act No. 592 had amended Section 133 of the Tax Code by eliminating the clause stating that tax attaches to spirits "as soon as it is in existence as such." This amendment indicated a legislative intent to tax only the "finished product" and not the spirits at their inception [1]. Furthermore, Section 129 allowed the removal of spirits for rectification without prepayment of specific tax [2].

The Court held that the exemption covered all unintentional, casual, unavoidable, or natural losses—whether through evaporation or leakage in transit—sustained prior to the conversion of the spirits into a finished product [3]. The subsequent enactment of R.A. No. 1608 in 1956, which restored the "existence as such" clause and explicitly disallowed losses for rectification and handling, confirmed that such losses were deductible or exempt under the prior law (R.A. No. 592) [4, 5]. The fact that the alcohol was not actually rectified due to loss is immaterial; Section 129 merely required that the removal be *for the purpose* of rectification [6].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **REVERSED**, and the Collector is ordered to refund the amount paid by the petitioner.
