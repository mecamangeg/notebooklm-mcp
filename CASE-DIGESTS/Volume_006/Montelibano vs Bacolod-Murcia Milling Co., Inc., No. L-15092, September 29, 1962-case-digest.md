I. CAPTION
ALFREDO MONTELIBANO, ET AL. v. BACOLOD-MURCIA MILLING CO., INC., G.R. No. L-15092, September 29, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants Montelibano, et al. appealed a decision of the Court of First Instance which dismissed their complaint against defendant-appellee Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co., Inc. [1, 2]. The lower court’s dismissal was based exclusively on questions of law raised by the defendant, ignoring other defenses based on questions of fact contained in the answer [2]. During the appeal, which pended for over two years, the appellee did not ask the lower court to make findings on these factual issues, nor did it call the Supreme Court's attention to them, limiting its brief to the legal issues upheld by the lower court [2]. After the Supreme Court rendered a decision reversing the dismissal, the appellee filed motions for reconsideration, arguing that the decision should be set aside to allow the lower court or the Court of Appeals to resolve the factual issues raised in its original answer [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the case should be remanded to the lower court to resolve the factual defenses raised in the answer but not ruled upon.
2. W/N the judgment is illegal for failing to determine the precise amount of sugar due to the appellants.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that piecemeal appeals are discouraged to prevent delay in the administration of justice and the clogging of court dockets [3]. The appellee submitted the case for decision exclusively on the issue of law and only called attention to factual issues after the decision went against it [3]. By failing to advert to its factual defenses until the case was decided, despite ample opportunity to do so, the appellee is deemed to have waived all such defenses [4]. This is consistent with the rule that a defendant who demurs to the plaintiff's evidence and obtains a dismissal on insufficiency cannot be allowed to submit evidence in its behalf if the dismissal is reversed on appeal (*Moody, Aronson & Company v. Hotel Bilbao*) [3].

2. **NO.** The argument that the judgment is illegal because the precise amount of sugar is not determined is untenable [4]. The Court fixed the additional percentages of sugar due to the appellants under the contract, making the exact amount of piculs a matter of arithmetical computation based on production records [4]. This determination can be ascertained by the court of origin in supplementary proceedings in aid of execution under Rule 34 of the Rules of Court, which do not constitute a new trial or rehearing (*Villones v. Nable*) [4].

The motions for reconsideration are denied [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Paredes, and Dizon concurred [5]. Justices Regala and Makalintal took no part [5].
