I. CAPTION
GIL SAN DIEGO and RUFINA SAN DIEGO v. THE HON. AGUSTIN P. MONTESA, Judge, Court of First Instance of Bulacan, et al., G.R. No. L-17985, September 29, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Jose, Maria, and Urbano de la Cruz filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan to recover a parcel of land from Petitioners Gil and Rufina San Diego. The CFI rendered a decision voiding the sale of the land to Petitioners but declared them builders in good faith [1]. The judgment ordered Petitioners to vacate the land *upon payment* to them by Respondents of the sum of P3,500.00 within 30 days after the decision became final [2]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision *in toto*, and it became final and executory [3].

Two years later, Petitioners moved to execute the judgment to collect the P3,500.00 indemnity. Respondent Judge Montesa denied the motion [3]. Respondents de la Cruz argued that under Article 448 of the Civil Code, they still had the option to either pay for the improvements or demand rent/sell the land to the builders, and they preferred to demand rent [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the landowners can still exercise the option under Article 448 (to appropriate the improvements or sell the land) after the judgment ordering them to pay indemnity has become final.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that while the landowner normally has the option under **Article 448** of the Civil Code to either appropriate the improvement or sell the land to the possessor in good faith, this option is no longer open when the judgment limiting them to the first alternative (appropriation/payment) has become final [5, 6].

The final judgment explicitly ordained the payment of P3,500.00 within 30 days. The order for Petitioners to vacate was conditioned *upon* this payment, in recognition of the **right of retention** granted to builders in good faith under **Article 546** (applicable via Article 448) [7]. Because the judgment is final and the 30-day period had elapsed, the CFI has the ministerial duty to order its execution [8].

Petition GRANTED. The CFI is ordered to issue the writ of execution [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
