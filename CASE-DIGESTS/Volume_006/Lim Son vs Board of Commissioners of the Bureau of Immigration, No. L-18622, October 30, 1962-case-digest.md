I. CAPTION
LIM SON v. THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE BUREAU OF IMMIGRATION, G.R. No. L-18622, October 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On October 12, 1949, a warrant of arrest was issued against petitioner Lim Son for deportation under Section 37(a)(9) of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940 for giving false testimony in an administrative investigation [1]. On July 14, 1955, the Board of Commissioners found him guilty and ordered his deportation. A warrant for deportation was issued on August 6, 1955, and his motion to re-open the proceedings was denied by the Board on September 3, 1955 [1].

Petitioner took no action until February 29, 1960—nearly five years later—when he filed a special civil action for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to enjoin his deportation. He argued the Board acted in excess of jurisdiction because his motion to re-open was denied by the Board rather than the Commissioner of Immigration exclusively, as allegedly required by Administrative Order No. 1 [2]. The CFI denied the petition, ruling it was barred by laches and devoid of merit. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner’s cause of action is barred by laches.
2. W/N the Board of Commissioners committed an irregularity in procedure or grave abuse of discretion.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the petitioner is guilty of laches due to his failure to assail the Board's decision for almost five years. The decision ordering his deportation was rendered on July 14, 1955, yet he did not file the action until February 29, 1960, nor did he offer any explanation for this long inaction [2, 3].

2. **NO.** The Court found no merit in the petitioner's claim of procedural irregularity. While the petitioner argued that the Commissioner of Immigration has exclusive authority to act on a motion to re-open under Administrative Order No. 1, the Court ruled that since the Commissioner is the Chairman of the Board of Commissioners, the action of the Board is effectively the action of the Commissioner [2]. Furthermore, there was absolutely no evidence that the Board committed grave abuse of discretion in finding the petitioner guilty of false testimony.

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED.
