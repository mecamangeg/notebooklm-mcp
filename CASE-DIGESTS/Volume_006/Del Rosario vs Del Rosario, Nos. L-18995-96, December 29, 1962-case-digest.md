I. CAPTION
AGUEDO DEL ROSARIO v. HON. N. BAENS DEL ROSARIO, EUGENIO DRILON and LUCIA DELORITOS, G.R. Nos. L-18995-96, December 29, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In January 1958, petitioner Aguedo del Rosario engaged ten men, including Eugenio Drilon and the deceased Francisco Digdigan, to perform excavation and dike work in his fishpond in Zarraga, Iloilo. The engagement was on a "pakiao" or piece-work basis, expected to last a month, with workers providing their own tools and food. On January 7, 1958, the workers were transported by the petitioner’s truck to the site. That evening, after work, they ate dinner consisting of rice brought by Drilon and fish caught from the pond. Shortly after, the workers suffered dizziness and convulsions. They were rushed to the hospital where Digdigan died the next day, while Drilon recovered. The cause was determined to be food poisoning, likely from the rice being contaminated by an insecticide (Endrin) during transport or storage.

Drilon and Digdigan’s mother, Lucia Deloritos, filed compensation claims. The Hearing Officer of Regional Office No. V dismissed the claims. On appeal, the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) set aside the dismissal and awarded compensation. Petitioner appealed, arguing there was no employer-employee relationship because the workers were engaged through an independent contractor, and that the accident occurred outside working hours.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N an employer-employee relationship existed between the petitioner and the workers.
2. W/N the death and illness caused by food poisoning outside working hours arose out of or in the course of employment.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the alleged independent contractor, Rufo Dimavildo, was merely a foreman or representative of the petitioner, as he had no capital of his own and was himself a laborer. Furthermore, the work performed—excavation and fixing of dikes—was not purely casual but was necessary for the operation of the petitioner's fishpond business. The Court cited *Caro v. Rilloraza* and *Mansal v. P.P. Gocheco Lumber Co.* to establish that laborers performing work directly connected with the employer's business are employees, not independent contractors.

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the injury is compensable. Although the food poisoning occurred after working hours, the nature of the employment required the workers to stay on the petitioner's premises for a month, away from normal home facilities. They were forced by the conditions of employment to forage for themselves and bring stored food, exposing them to hazards regarding food safety to which the general public is not exposed. The Court applied the principle that injuries occurring on the premises, even outside regular hours, are compensable if the employment conditions (such as the requirement to live on the premises) create the risk. This aligns with the doctrine in *Martha Lumber Mills, Inc. v. Lagradante*.

The order and resolution of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission are **AFFIRMED**.
