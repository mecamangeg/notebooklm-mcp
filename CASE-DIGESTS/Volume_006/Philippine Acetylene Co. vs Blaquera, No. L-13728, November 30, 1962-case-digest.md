I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE ACETYLENE CO. v. SILVERIO BLAQUERA, as Collector of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. L-13728, November 30, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Philippine Acetylene Co., a domestic corporation manufacturing oxygen and acetylene gases, was assessed by respondent Collector of Internal Revenue for deficiency sales tax and surcharge amounting to P10,879.03 for the period from 1951 to the second quarter of 1955 [1, 2]. In billing its customers, petitioner computed the 7% sales tax based on the gross selling price without deducting the cost of raw materials used [3, 4]. However, in its income tax returns and payments to the government, petitioner computed the 7% tax based on the gross selling price *minus* the value of the raw materials [3, 4]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) upheld the legality of the assessment, ruling that petitioner cannot enrich itself by collecting more tax from customers than what it pays to the government [1, 5, 6]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the respondent's computation violated General Circular No. 431 and amounted to double taxation [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the deficiency sales tax assessment against petitioner is valid based on the method of computation used.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals. Under Section 186 of the National Internal Revenue Code and General Circular Nos. 431 and 440, for the sales tax to be excluded from the taxable gross selling price, it must be billed as a separate item and must represent the *correct* amount of tax [7].

The Court found petitioner's method unfair and illegal because it billed customers a tax calculated on the total gross price (without deductions) but paid the government a tax calculated on a lower base (with deductions for raw materials) [4]. Petitioner essentially collected more from its customers than what was legally due to the government, enriching itself at their expense [4, 6]. The correct procedure, pursuant to the law and circulars, is to deduct the cost of raw materials from the gross selling price *first*, and then impose the 7% tax on the remainder [7]. Since petitioner failed to bill the correct tax amount, the respondent's assessment was proper [8].

**Decision affirmed.**
