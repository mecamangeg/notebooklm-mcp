I. CAPTION
VICENTE GARCIA, ET AL. v. JOSE FENOY, G.R. No. L-17560, October 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs (Garcias) filed Civil Case No. 13847 against Pedro de Guzman to recover a parcel of land, annotating a notice of *lis pendens* on De Guzman's title. Meanwhile, De Guzman won Civil Case No. 8425, claiming P55,754.26 as compensation for a portion of said land expropriated by the government. To facilitate the collection of this amount, which was stalled by the *lis pendens*, De Guzman's counsel, defendant Jose Fenoy, promised plaintiffs' counsel in writing that he would give them one-fourth (1/4) of the proceeds if they agreed to limit the *lis pendens* to the remaining unexpropriated land. Plaintiffs agreed, and De Guzman collected the money. When Fenoy refused to pay, plaintiffs filed suit. The trial court dismissed the complaint, ruling that Fenoy was not authorized by his client to make such a promise and that plaintiffs' cause of action depended on the final outcome of the land dispute in Civil Case No. 13847.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs have a cause of action to collect the promised share of the expropriation proceeds from the defendant.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the dismissal, but on the ground that the plaintiffs have no right to the land involved. The Supreme Court took judicial notice of its own decision in the related case, *Garcia v. De Guzman* (G.R. No. L-15988, August 30, 1962), which affirmed that the plaintiffs' claim to the land in Civil Case No. 13847 was barred by a prior decree of registration and the statute of limitations [1]. Since the plaintiffs had no right to the land, the partial cancellation of their notice of *lis pendens* caused them no damage whatsoever, and they consequently have no cause of action against Fenoy regarding the proceeds derived from that land [2].

The order appealed from is affirmed [2].
