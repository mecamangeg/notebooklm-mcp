I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE LAND-AIR-SEA LABOR UNION (PLASLU), SEVERINO BUNGOLTO and 14 OTHERS v. KIN SAN RICE AND CORN MILL COMPANY and/or TIBURCIO MA, TUBOD LABOR UNION, et al., and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-18235, October 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, a labor union (PLASLU) and 14 employees of respondent Kin San Rice & Corn Mill Company, filed a complaint for unfair labor practices on August 15, 1955. They alleged that officers of respondent Tubod Labor Union coerced PLASLU members to join their union, physically assaulting petitioner Feliciano Angcajas on April 9, 1955. Additionally, they claimed the company manager, Tiburcio Ma, discriminated against PLASLU members by refusing them work on April 20, 1955 [1, 2].

The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) trial judge, Judge Bautista, initially found the respondents guilty and ordered reinstatement with back wages [3]. However, upon respondents' motion for reconsideration, the CIR *en banc* set aside the trial judge's decision and dismissed the complaint, ruling that the petitioners failed to substantiate their claims [4]. Petitioners appealed by certiorari, contending the CIR *en banc* abused its discretion in reversing the trial judge's factual findings regarding the sufficiency of evidence [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR *en banc* erred in reversing the findings of fact of the trial judge regarding the alleged unfair labor practices.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR *en banc* resolution. The Court ruled that decisions of the Court of Industrial Relations are open for review on appeal by certiorari only as to questions of law, not as to questions of fact or the sufficiency of evidence to support findings of fact [6].

The Court further explained that the CIR, sitting *en banc* on a motion for reconsideration, is not bound to accept the findings of fact and law made by the individual judge who tried the case. The *en banc* court has the authority and duty to ascertain whether the trial judge's findings are supported by the record and to reverse them if they are not [6]. Since the CIR *en banc* determined that the alleged acts of coercion and discrimination were not committed, the Supreme Court could not reverse this factual finding [6].

The resolution appealed from is AFFIRMED [7].
