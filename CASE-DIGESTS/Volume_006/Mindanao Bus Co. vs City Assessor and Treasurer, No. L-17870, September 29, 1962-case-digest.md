I. CAPTION
MINDANAO BUS COMPANY v. THE CITY ASSESSOR & TREASURER and the BOARD OF TAX APPEALS of Cagayan de Oro City, G.R. No. L-17870, September 29, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Mindanao Bus Company is a public utility engaged in transporting passengers and cargo by motor truck in Mindanao [1]. It maintains a main office and repair shop in Cagayan de Oro City, located on land it owns. Inside the shop are various machineries—such as an electric welder, boring machine, lathe, grinder, and battery charger—sitting on cement or wooden platforms [2], [3]. These machines are used to repair and maintain the petitioner's trucks [3].

The City Assessor of Cagayan de Oro assessed these machineries as real property subject to realty tax [4]. The petitioner appealed, arguing they are movable personal property. The Board of Tax Appeals and subsequently the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) sustained the assessment, ruling that the equipment was "immobilized by destination" under Paragraph 5, Article 415 of the New Civil Code, as they were intended for an industry [4], [5]. Petitioner filed this petition for review [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the maintenance and repair equipment of a transportation company constitute immovable property subject to real estate tax.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals [6].

For movable equipment to be considered "immobilized by destination" under Article 415(5) of the Civil Code, two requisites must be met: (1) they must be intended for an industry or works carried on in a building or on a piece of land; and (2) they must tend *directly* to meet the needs of said industry [7].

Regarding the first requisite, the Court held that the petitioner's business is transportation, which is carried on upon the public roads and highways, not in a building or permanently on a piece of land [8]. The repair shop is merely a collateral facility.

Regarding the second requisite, the Court applied the "essentiality test." Movables become immobilized only if they are "essential and principal elements" of the industry, without which the industry could not function [9], [10]. Distinguishing this from *Berkenkotter v. Cu Unjieng*, the Court ruled that the tools here are merely incidental to the transportation business [10], [11]. The business involves moving passengers and cargo, which can be accomplished even without owning a repair shop (e.g., by using third-party services) [11]. Since the equipment are mere incidentals and not essential to the industry, and the industry is not carried on in a building/land, the equipment retains its character as personal property and is not subject to real estate tax [8].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is SET ASIDE and the equipment is declared not subject to assessment as real estate [6].
