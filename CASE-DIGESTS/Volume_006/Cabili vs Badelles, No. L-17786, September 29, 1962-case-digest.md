I. CAPTION
CAMILO P. CABILI and THE HON. MANUEL ESTIPONA vs. MARIANO LL. BADELLES and HON. COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-17786, September 29, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cabili and respondent Badelles were rival candidates for City Mayor of Iligan in the November 10, 1959 elections. After Cabili was proclaimed winner, Badelles filed a *quo warranto* petition (Election Case No. 288) questioning Cabili's residency. Badelles was represented by the law firm San Juan, Africa and Benedicto. During the initial hearing, lead counsel Atty. Jose L. Africa requested that all notices be served at his law office in Manila [1].

The Court of First Instance (CFI) dismissed the petition on December 19, 1959. A copy of the decision was sent by registered air mail to Atty. Africa on December 24, 1959, which he received on January 4, 1960 [2]. However, on December 28, 1959, Badelles personally requested and received a copy of the decision from the judge in Iligan City, though he refused to sign a receipt. The judge also telegraphed Atty. Africa regarding the decision, which the latter received on December 29, 1959 [3].

Atty. Africa filed a notice of appeal on January 4, 1960. The CFI dismissed the appeal, ruling it was filed beyond the five-day statutory period reckoned from Badelles' personal receipt on December 28. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the CFI, holding that the period should be counted from the counsel's receipt of the decision [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the period to appeal should be reckoned from the date the party personally received the decision, rather than the date his counsel of record received it.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, ruling that the appeal was timely filed. Although the Rules of Court are generally not applicable to election cases, they apply in a suppletory character whenever practicable and convenient. Since the Election Law contains no specific provision regarding the manner of notifying parties, Section 2, Rule 27 of the Rules of Court applies [6].

Under said Rule, service of decisions must be made to the lawyers on record and not to the parties. The Court reiterated established jurisprudence that when a party appears by an attorney, service must be made upon said attorney; notice to the client is not notice in law [6]. Furthermore, the telegram received by counsel did not constitute valid service as it did not contain the contents of the decision [5]. Consequently, the period to appeal began only when Atty. Africa received the copy of the decision on January 4, 1960.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [7].
