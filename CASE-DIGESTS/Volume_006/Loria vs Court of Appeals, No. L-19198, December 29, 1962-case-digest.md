I. CAPTION
ANTONIO D. LORIA v. COURT OF APPEALS and HEIRS OF MERCEDES LOPEZ BENDER, G.R. No. L-19198, December 29, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On August 1, 1959, the Court of First Instance of Nueva Vizcaya rendered a decision against petitioner Antonio D. Loria and in favor of Mercedes Lopez Bender [1]. Loria's counsel obtained an extension of twenty (20) days to take action, receiving notice of the grant on February 21, 1961 [1]. On March 6, 1961, within the extension period, Loria filed a "Motion for New Trial and Reconsideration" based on newly discovered evidence and specific legal grounds [1]. This motion was denied, and Loria received the notice of denial on March 21, 1961 [1]. Four days later, on March 25, 1961, Loria filed his notice of appeal and appeal bond [1].

However, when the case reached the Court of Appeals (CA), Bender moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing it was not perfected on time [1, 2]. The CA granted the dismissal, ruling that Loria's motion for new trial was merely *pro forma* and did not suspend the running of the period to appeal [2]. Loria filed this petition for certiorari and mandamus to annul the CA's resolutions [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Loria’s Motion for New Trial and Reconsideration was *pro forma*, thereby failing to suspend the period to perfect his appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the motion was not *pro forma* and therefore suspended the running of the period to appeal [4].

A motion is not *pro forma* when it specifically describes newly discovered evidence and raises distinct legal arguments [4]. In this case, Loria’s motion specifically listed evidence such as a Department of Agriculture decision (D.A.N.R. Case No. 1583), affidavits regarding land purchases, and irrigation system plans [5-8]. Furthermore, the motion argued specific points regarding Loria’s superior right to possession as recognized by the Bureau of Lands and challenged Bender's lack of legal rights to the property [9, 10]. Because the motion was valid and not *pro forma*, its filing interrupted the reglementary period. Consequently, Loria's subsequent appeal was perfected within the prescribed time [4].

The resolutions of the Court of Appeals were annulled, and the CA was directed to give due course to the appeal [4].
