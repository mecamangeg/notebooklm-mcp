I. CAPTION
RAMCAR, INC. v. EUSEBIO S. MILLAR, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17760, October 31, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ramcar, Inc. operated an auto repair and body building shop on General Luna Street, Ermita, Manila. Respondents, who resided near the shop, filed an action with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to abate the establishment as a nuisance due to the constant noise and annoyance caused by its machinery and work schedule. Ramcar argued that its business was licensed as a "garage," a permitted use in the commercial zone under City Ordinance No. 2830. The CFI dismissed the complaint. Upon appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the decision, declaring the shop a public nuisance and a violation of the zoning ordinance. The CA ordered the removal of the establishment and the demolition of all structures, and awarded special damages and attorney's fees to respondents. Ramcar appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing its business was a valid garage and that the structures should not be demolished.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner's body building shop constitutes a "garage" permitted under the city zoning ordinance.
2. W/N the courts may abate the nuisance and award damages despite the City Board's inaction.
3. W/N the order to demolish the petitioner's buildings is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A body building shop is not within the purview of a "garage" under the ordinance. A garage designates a shop for storing, repairing, and servicing motor vehicles, serving as a modern substitute for a livery stable [1]. The term "repair" presupposes restoring decayed or broken parts to their original condition and does not apply to the manufacturing or remodeling of body structures, which involves distinct tools and noise levels [2, 3].

2. **YES.** While the municipal board has the power to declare nuisances, its inaction does not preclude courts from determining the existence of a nuisance in a specific case [4]. The CA's finding that the shop is a nuisance is a question of fact conclusive on the Supreme Court [3]. Furthermore, Article 697 of the Civil Code expressly authorizes the recovery of damages for the past existence of a nuisance even after its abatement [5].

3. **NO.** The business of car body building is not a nuisance *per se*; it becomes a nuisance only on account of its location. To abate it, it is not necessary to remove all buildings and structures, as they may be utilized for other pursuits not forbidden by law [5].

**Disposition:** The judgment of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The petitioner is permanently enjoined from operating its body building activities in its present location, but the order requiring the demolition of the existing buildings is set aside.
