I. CAPTION
KAPISANAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA NG ALAK (NAFLU) v. HAMILTON DISTILLERY COMPANY, CO BON BENG, MARIANO ANG ENG and HAMILTON WORKERS’ UNION, G.R. No. L-18112, October 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On September 24, 1957, two labor unions at Hamilton Distillery Company (Company) were registered: the petitioner Kapisanan ng mga Manggagawa ng Alak (NAFLU) and the respondent Hamilton Workers’ Union (Workers' Union). On the same day, the Company and the Workers' Union executed a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) containing a "closed shop" clause. Consequently, the Company issued a notice requiring all employees to join the Workers' Union within 30 days or face dismissal.

Prior to this, Company officials had threatened NAFLU's president with dismissal if he did not dissolve the union. When NAFLU members refused to disaffiliate and join the Workers' Union, the Company dismissed them on October 28, 1957. NAFLU filed a complaint for unfair labor practice. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) dismissed the complaint, ruling that the dismissal was justified by the "closed shop" provision in the CBA. NAFLU appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of NAFLU members based on the "closed shop" provision in the CBA was valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The dismissal was invalid and constituted an unfair labor practice. The Supreme Court held that "closed shop" provisions in a collective bargaining agreement apply only to persons to be hired or to employees who are not yet members of any labor organization. They are inapplicable to those already in the service who are members of another union at the time of the agreement's execution.

To hold otherwise would compel employees to disaffiliate from their minority union and join the majority union, rendering nugatory their right to self-organization and to form, join, or assist labor organizations of their own choosing. This right is guaranteed by the Industrial Peace Act (Section 3, Republic Act No. 875) and the Constitution (Article III, Section 1[1]). Citing *Freeman Shirt Manufacturing Co. v. CIR*, the Court reversed the CIR decision and ordered the reinstatement of the dismissed employees with back wages.
