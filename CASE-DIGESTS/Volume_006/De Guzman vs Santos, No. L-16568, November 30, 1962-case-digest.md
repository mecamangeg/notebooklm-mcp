I. CAPTION
GREGORIO DE GUZMAN v. GUILLERMO E. SANTOS and MANUEL PANER, G.R. No. L-16568, November 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Gregorio de Guzman owned a parcel of rice land in Antipolo, Rizal, tenanted by Respondent Manuel Paner. In February 1959, De Guzman notified Paner of his intention to personally cultivate the land for the 1959-1960 agricultural year. Paner voluntarily surrendered possession. However, Paner later filed a complaint with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR), alleging he was illegally dispossessed because De Guzman did not actually cultivate the land himself. The CAR ruled in favor of Paner, finding that De Guzman only performed superficial tasks like weeding dikes and entrusted major farm work (plowing and harrowing) to others, thereby violating the "personal cultivation" requirement. De Guzman argued that the assistance he received was under the traditional *bayanihan* (cooperative labor) system and that he personally attended to the care of the plants.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the landowner’s use of the *bayanihan* or exchange labor system constitutes a failure to "personally cultivate" the land under the Agricultural Tenancy Act.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CAR decision. The Court held that "cultivation" is not limited to plowing and harrowing but includes the maintenance, repair, and weeding of dikes, paddies, and irrigation canals, which De Guzman performed (Sec. 38, R.A. No. 1199). Furthermore, the requirement of personal cultivation does not preclude a landholder from availing of the labor of others through the "bayanihan" or exchange labor system (also known as "amuyo," "tagnawa," or "palusong"). The law does not prohibit the practice of *bayanihan* for either the tenant or the landholder (*Salcedo v. Court of Agrarian Relations*, G.R. No. L-13274). Since a tenant is allowed to use such help, there is no reason a landholder cultivating the land himself should be barred from doing the same. Consequently, De Guzman did not act in bad faith, and the award of damages to Paner was unauthorized and unproven.

Petition granted. Decision reversed.
