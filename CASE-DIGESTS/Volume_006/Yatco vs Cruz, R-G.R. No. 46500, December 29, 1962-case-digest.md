I. CAPTION
TESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED MARIA JACOBA CRUZ; LUTGARDA YATCO, et al. v. DANIEL F. CRUZ, et al., R-G.R. No. 46500, December 29, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Lutgarda Yatco, et al. filed a petition with the Supreme Court to reconstitute the Court's pre-war decisions in G.R. No. 46500 (decided October 25, 1939) and G.R. No. 48114 (decided October 5, 1942), the original records of which were destroyed during the war. To prove the contents of the lost decisions, petitioners submitted a copy published in the "Lawyers' Journal" for G.R. No. 46500 and a typewritten copy certified as correct by former Justice Ricardo Paras, the ponente, for G.R. No. 48114.

Oppositors Daniel F. Cruz, et al. objected, arguing that the period to file for reconstitution under Republic Act No. 441 and Act No. 3110 had already expired. They further contended that the copies submitted were not "authentic" as required by said laws and that the judgments could no longer be enforced as more than 10 years had elapsed since their promulgation.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court decisions in finished cases can be reconstituted despite the expiration of the period provided in RA 441 and Act No. 3110.
2. W/N the production of authentic copies is strictly necessary for reconstitution.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that neither Republic Act No. 441 nor Act No. 3110 applies to the case at bar because those laws refer only to **pending** cases and judicial proceedings. For finished cases, courts have the **inherent power** to restore and supply deficiencies in their records and proceedings at any time, in accordance with **Section 5(h), Rule 124 of the Rules of Court**. The Court cited *Allingag v. Del Valle-Cruz* to affirm that reconstitution of finished cases is not bound by the periods set for pending cases. Regarding the enforceability of the judgments after 10 years, the Court refrained from ruling on the matter, stating it should be raised when enforcement is actually sought.

2. **NO.** It is not essential or necessary that an "authentic" copy be produced to reconstitute a decision under Rule 124. Evidence sufficient to prove the contents of a lost or destroyed document in accordance with the rules of evidence (**Section 51, Rule 123**) is sufficient. The Court accepted the Lawyers' Journal copy as it is a legal publication dedicated to publishing decisions secured directly from the Court. For the second case, the Court accepted the simple copy certified by former Justice Paras, whose memory the current members of the Court could attest to.

Petition granted.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
