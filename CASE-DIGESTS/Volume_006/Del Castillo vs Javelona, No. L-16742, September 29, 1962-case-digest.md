I. CAPTION
SERGIO F. DEL CASTILLO v. MANUEL H. JAVELONA, et al., G.R. No. L-16742, September 29, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On October 7, 1959, Sergio F. del Castillo filed a complaint for breach of contract (Civil Case No. 330) against Ma-ao Sugar Central Co., Inc. before the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Bago, presided by respondent JP Manuel H. Javelona. JP Javelona requested the Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance (CFI) to authorize his inhibition from the case because the defendant's counsel, Atty. Emilio Y. Hilado, was his first-degree cousin. The Executive Judge granted the request and designated JP Luis G. Torres of Pulupandan to hear the case. Del Castillo filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that relationship to counsel is not a legal ground for disqualification under Rule 126 of the Rules of Court. The new Executive Judge denied the motion, ruling that while the ground was not in Rule 126, it was a valid cause for voluntary inhibition. Del Castillo filed a petition for Certiorari and Mandamus with the Supreme Court, questioning the jurisdiction of the designated judge and the validity of the inhibition.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a judge may voluntarily inhibit himself from a case on grounds other than those explicitly enumerated in Rule 126 of the Rules of Court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Rule 126 enumerates the grounds for disqualification of a judge upon being challenged, but it does not prohibit a judge from voluntarily inhibiting himself on good, sound, and/or ethical grounds. The Court held that voluntary inhibition is a matter of discretion on the part of the judge and the official empowered to act upon the request.

Citing *Gutierrez v. Hon. A. Santos*, the Court emphasized that "every litigant is entitled to nothing less than the cold neutrality of an impartial judge" and that judges must administer justice free from suspicion of bias and prejudice. If the defendant were to win the case, the petitioner might suspect that the judge was biased due to the maxim "Blood is thicker than water." Furthermore, the Court noted the supervisory powers of the CFI over Justice of the Peace courts under Sections 96 and 97 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, which supports the Executive Judge's authority to approve such inhibition.

The petition is **DISMISSED** for lack of merit.
