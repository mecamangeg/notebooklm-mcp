I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GERARDO DUMLAO, JUAN FAMULARCANO, DIEGO FAMULARCANO and FROILAN TABUNDAY, G.R. No. L-17163, September 28, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
During the Japanese occupation, Captain Engracio Doble and his son, Sgt. Bendito Doble, of the Western Luzon Guerrilla forces, went to the evacuation place of Juan Famularcano in Botolan, Zambales on March 23, 1943. They inquired why guerrilla officers Gerardo Dumlao and Juan Famularcano missed a recent conference. The next morning, March 24, while crossing the Maguisguis River with Diego Famularcano as their guide, shots were fired from the other side, wounding Engracio. Bendito fled and hid, witnessing the attackers—identified as Gerardo Dumlao, Juan Famularcano, Diego Famularcano, Froilan Tabunday, and Isidro Ramos—finish off his father.

The accused claimed alibi and denial. Juan and Froilan claimed they were in Sitio Camao looking for sugar, while Gerardo claimed he only learned of the death later. The Court of First Instance of Zambales rejected their defenses, convicted them of murder, and sentenced them to life imprisonment.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused's defense of alibi and denial is sufficient to overturn their conviction for murder.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court ruled that mere denial and alibi cannot prosper against positive identification and the findings of fact by the trial court regarding credibility [1, 2].

The defense crumbled due to inconsistencies: (1) Juan Famularcano’s 1949 affidavit admitted neither he nor Froilan went to Camao on the day of the crime, contradicting their testimony [1, 2]; and (2) Juan admitted in the same affidavit that Diego told him Gerardo shot Engracio—a statement Gerardo failed to deny [1, 2]. Furthermore, the prosecution established a motive: the accused believed Engracio was responsible for the execution of their cousins, Eulogia and Wenceslao Dumlao, for espionage [3, 4].

Decision affirmed.
