I. CAPTION
**PASTOR D. AGO v. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. MONTANO A. ORTIZ, THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF SURIGAO and GRACE PARK ENGINEERING, INC.**, G.R. No. L-17898, October 31, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pastor D. Ago bought sawmill machineries from respondent Grace Park Engineering, Inc. (Grace Park), secured by a chattel mortgage [1]. Upon Ago's default, Grace Park initiated extra-judicial foreclosure, which Ago sought to enjoin via a Special Civil Case [1]. The parties reached a compromise, and the CFI Judge dictated a judgment in open court on January 28, 1959 [1, 2]. Ago subsequently sold the machineries to Golden Pacific Sawmill, Inc., where they were permanently installed in a building [3, 4].

Grace Park later obtained a writ of execution due to Ago's continued default [3]. The Sheriff levied on the machineries and scheduled a sale [3]. Ago filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA), arguing the execution was void because he had not been formally served a copy of the written judgment before the writ was issued [5]. The CA dismissed the petition, ruling that the dictation of the judgment in open court was sufficient notice [6, 7]. The Sheriff proceeded to sell the machineries to Grace Park without publishing the notice of sale in a newspaper [8, 9].

III. ISSUES
1. W/N the dictation of the judgment in open court constitutes valid rendition and notice to the parties.
2. W/N the installed sawmill machineries became immovable property, rendering the execution sale void for lack of publication.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the mere pronouncement of a judgment in open court does not constitute rendition [10]. Under Section 1, Rule 35 of the Rules of Court, rendition is the filing of the signed decision with the Clerk of Court [10]. Until filed, the decision is subject to amendment and is not binding [11]. Furthermore, hearing the dictation is not valid notice; Section 7, Rule 27 expressly requires final orders or judgments to be served personally or by registered mail [12]. Because the writ of execution was issued before the petitioner was validly served with the signed judgment, the writ was null and void [13].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that by installing the sawmill machineries in the building for use in the sawing industry, they became real estate under Article 415(5) of the Civil Code [4]. Relying on *Berkenkotter vs. Cu Unjieng*, the Court explained that machineries intended by the owner for an industry carried on in a building, which tend directly to meet the needs of said industry, are immovable [9, 14]. Consequently, the Sheriff's sale was void for failing to comply with Section 16, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which requires publication of the notice of sale for real property [9, 15].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **SET ASIDE**, and the writ of execution and Sheriff's sale are declared **NULL AND VOID** [15].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred [15]. Justice Padilla took no part [16].
