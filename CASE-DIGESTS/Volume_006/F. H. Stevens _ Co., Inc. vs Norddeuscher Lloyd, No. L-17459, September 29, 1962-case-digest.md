**I. CAPTION**
**DIWATA VARGAS v. SALVADOR LANGCAY, CORAZON LANGCAY, HELEN LANGCAY and JOSE AGUAS**, G.R. No. L-17459, September 29, 1962, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
On June 5, 1955, sisters Corazon and Helen Langcay were injured when hit by a jeepney driven by Ramon B. Aguas in Manila [1]. Ramon was convicted of physical injuries through reckless imprudence [1]. The records of the Public Service Commission (PSC) and Motor Vehicles Office showed that petitioner Diwata Vargas was the registered owner and operator of the jeepney [2]. Consequently, the victims' parents sued Vargas and the driver for damages [2].

Vargas argued she was no longer the owner at the time of the accident, having sold the vehicle to Jose B. Aguas (the driver's father) in 1953, and that her certificate of public convenience had been cancelled [2]. The Court of First Instance sentenced Vargas and the driver jointly and severally liable [2]. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the award but modified the nature of liability, ruling that Vargas was only **subsidiarily liable** under Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code [3, 4]. The CA reasoned that since the victims were not passengers, there was no contract of carriage to support direct Civil Code liability [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the registered owner of a public utility vehicle is directly and primarily liable for damages caused by its operation, despite having sold the vehicle to a third party prior to the accident.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the registered owner/operator of a passenger vehicle is **jointly and severally liable** with the driver for damages incurred by third persons [5].

The Court ruled that regardless of who the actual owner is, the operator of record continues to be the operator regarding the public and is **directly and primarily responsible** for the consequences of its operation [6, 7]. In contemplation of law, the registered owner is the employer of the driver, while the actual owner/employer is merely considered the agent of the registered owner [8, 9].

Citing *Erezo v. Jepte* and *Tamayo v. Aquino*, the Court emphasized that the law does not allow a registered owner to evade responsibility by proving a transfer to a third person [5, 10]. If this were allowed, it would be easy to escape liability by collusion, leaving victims without recourse against indefinite or insolvent transferees [10]. Therefore, the CA erred in applying Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code (subsidiary liability); Vargas stands liable directly based on the principle of registered ownership [7].

**Decision modified.** The petitioner is held directly and primarily liable.
