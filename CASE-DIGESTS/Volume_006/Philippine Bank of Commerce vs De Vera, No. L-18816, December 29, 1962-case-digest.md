I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE BANK OF COMMERCE v. TOMAS DE VERA, G.R. No. L-18816, December 29, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant Tomas De Vera was indebted to the Philippine Bank of Commerce for P127,312.24, secured by a real estate mortgage [1]. Upon maturity in 1956, De Vera failed to pay, prompting the Bank to extrajudicially foreclose the mortgage under Act No. 3135 [2]. The property was sold at public auction to the Bank for P86,700.00 [3]. The Bank subsequently filed a suit to recover the remaining deficiency, which amounted to P99,033.20 including interest [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ordered De Vera to pay the deficiency [4]. De Vera appealed, arguing that Act No. 3135 does not explicitly authorize the recovery of a deficiency after an extrajudicial foreclosure sale [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the mortgagee is entitled to recover the deficiency balance from the debtor after the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgaged property under Act No. 3135.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the creditor may recover the deficiency. Under Article 2131 of the New Civil Code, the Mortgage Law governs matters not strictly included in the Code, and the Mortgage Law allows for deficiency claims [6, 7]. While Act No. 3135 is silent on deficiencies, it does not expressly prohibit their recovery. The Court contrasted this with pledges (Art. 2115, Civil Code) and chattel mortgages (Art. 1484, Civil Code), where the law explicitly bars the recovery of deficiencies [8]. In the absence of such a prohibition in Act No. 3135, the principle that a mortgage is merely a security and not a satisfaction of the debt applies [7]. Thus, resorting to extrajudicial foreclosure is not a waiver of the right to demand payment for the whole debt [9]. The decision of the lower court is affirmed.
