I. CAPTION
THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, petitioner, vs. ESTEBAN ABAD, ET AL., claimants; BEATRIZ CASTAÑEDA, claimant-respondent-appellee, vs. LEONOR CASTILLO, thru her Guardian TOMAS MANUEL, claimant-petitioner-appellant, G.R. No. L-18372, November 29, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
In a cadastral case regarding Lots Nos. 9102 and 9103 of the San Narciso (Zambales) Cadastre, an order of general default was entered on June 12, 1956, as only claimant Beatriz Castañeda appeared. Castañeda then presented evidence of her claim. The following day, Tomas Manuel, representing the minor claimant Leonor Castillo, filed an answer claiming ownership. Manuel subsequently moved to set aside the June 12 hearing, alleging fraud by Castañeda.

On September 28, 1956, the trial court issued an order declaring the lots "contested." Castañeda accepted this status by moving to set the case for hearing. However, Castañeda later reversed her stance and moved to dismiss Castillo’s claim, arguing Manuel lacked standing and the answer was unverified. On October 15, 1957, the trial court denied Manuel's motion and adjudicated the lots to Castañeda, reasoning that the order of general default had not been lifted and Castillo’s answer was defective. Castillo appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in adjudicating the lots to the appellee without affording the appellant a hearing to present evidence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court committed a reversible error. The trial court's order on September 28, 1956, declaring the lots "contested," had the legal effect of setting aside the previous order of default insofar as Castillo was concerned. This order effectively admitted her answer and recognized her standing in court. Since the appellee acquiesced to this order by requesting a hearing, the trial court could not subsequently adjudicate the lots to the appellee without giving the appellant an opportunity to be heard and present evidence. Doing so effectively set aside the final order of September 28 without basis.

The order appealed from is **SET ASIDE**, and the case is **REMANDED** to the court *a quo* for further proceedings.
