I. CAPTION
MIGUEL R. SOCCO and PURA VARONA SOCCO v. SALVADORA G. GARCIA, PACIFICO GARCIA, HON. LUIS B. REYES, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, HON. W. L. CORNEJO, Judge of the Municipal Court of Manila, and THE SHERIFF OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-18231, October 31, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Socco and Varona were defendants in an unlawful detainer case filed by respondents Garcia in the Municipal Court of Manila. After the Municipal Court rendered judgment against them, petitioners filed a petition for relief from judgment in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila (Civil Case No. 43641), claiming they were deprived of their day in court. The CFI dismissed the petition for relief, ruling that while their failure to appear might be excusable, they failed to show a meritorious defense.

Petitioners filed a notice of appeal one day past the reglementary period due to a typhoon. The CFI resolved to give due course to the appeal "conditioned, however, that the plaintiffs amend their record on appeal within five days" to conform to the defendants' opposition. Instead of filing the redrafted record within the 5-day period (which expired November 3, 1960), petitioners filed a "Compliance" stating the record was not final and requested a 7-day extension. They subsequently requested another extension on November 10. The court did not act on these motions. Petitioners finally submitted the redrafted record on appeal on December 9, 1960. On December 27, 1960, the CFI issued an order denying the motions for approval and dismissing the appeal for failure to file the record on time. Petitioners filed a petition for mandamus with the Court of Appeals, which was dismissed, leading to this petition before the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the petitioners' appeal for failure to file the amended record on appeal within the mandated period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal was proper. Under Section 7, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, if the trial judge orders the amendment of the record, the appellant must redraft the record within the time limited in the order or such extension granted.

The Court emphasized that petitions for extension of time are directed to the discretion of the court, and favorable action thereon cannot be taken for granted by the parties. A party who relies on or anticipates such action does so at his own risk. In this case, the petitioners failed to file the redrafted record within the original 5-day period and further failed to file it even within the extension periods they had requested. The redrafted record was only submitted on December 9, long after the deadline. Consequently, the denial of the motions for extension and the dismissal of the appeal did not constitute an abuse of discretion warranting the issuance of a writ of mandamus.

Petition dismissed; writ of preliminary injunction dissolved.
