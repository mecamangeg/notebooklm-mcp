I. CAPTION
BONIFACIO SY PIÑERO alias LUA TO SY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17399, October 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Bonifacio Sy Piñero, born in Dipolog to Chinese parents, filed a petition for naturalization. At the time of the hearing, he was a student in Manila working as an employee at Columbia Sales Enterprise with a monthly salary of P120.00. He had P2,000.00 in savings and received free board and lodging from his brother-in-law in Manila. His character witnesses were permanent residents of Dipolog. However, records showed that from 1952 to 1960, the petitioner studied and resided in Cebu and later in Manila, returning to Dipolog only during school vacations. The Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Norte admitted him to Philippine citizenship. The Republic appealed, questioning the lucrative nature of his occupation and the qualification of his witnesses.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative income or occupation.
2. W/N the character witnesses are competent to vouch for the petitioner's good moral character.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A monthly salary of P120.00 is not considered lucrative, even if free board and lodging and savings are taken into account [1, 2]. The Court emphasized that the high cost of living and low purchasing power of the currency must be considered [1, 2]. The Court distinguished this case from *Lim v. Republic* (1953), noting that in *Lim*, the purchasing power was higher, the cost of living was lower, and the free board and lodging were provided by the applicant's father (an employer), whereas here they were provided by a brother-in-law, who is not as likely to continue such support indefinitely [1, 3].

2. **NO.** The witnesses did not have sufficient background and basis to vouch for the petitioner’s character or qualify as "insurers" of his good conduct [4, 5]. Since the petitioner lived in Cebu and Manila for eight years (1952–1960) and the witnesses were permanent residents of Dipolog who only saw him during vacations or occasionally in transit, they lacked ample time and opportunity to observe his conduct [4, 6].

The appealed decision is **REVERSED** and **SET ASIDE** [5].
