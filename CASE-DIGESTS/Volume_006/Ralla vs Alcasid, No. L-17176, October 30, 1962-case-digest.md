I. CAPTION
ROSENDO RALLA and PABLO RALLA v. HON. MATEO L. ALCASID, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Albay and PEDRO RALLA, G.R. No. L-17176, October 30, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On January 5, 1960, Pedro Ralla filed an action for partition in the Court of First Instance of Albay against his father, Rosendo Ralla, and brother, Pablo Ralla, involving 212 parcels of land valued at P270,000.00 [1]. Pedro also prayed for the appointment of a receiver, alleging that the properties were conjugal assets of Rosendo and his deceased wife (Pedro's mother), and that he was being deprived of his share and income [1, 2]. Petitioners (Rosendo and Pablo) opposed, claiming exclusive ownership over various parcels [1].

After hearings, the trial court appointed a receiver, finding that: (1) most properties were registered as conjugal; (2) petitioners were disposing of the properties to prejudice Pedro's interest; (3) income was being lost or removed; and (4) strained relations prevented satisfactory administration [2-4]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that receivership is generally irregular in partition proceedings and that a counter-bond should suffice [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in appointing a receiver in a partition proceeding.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court found no abuse of discretion. Under Section 1(b) of Rule 61 of the Rules of Court, a receiver may be appointed when the applicant has an interest in the property and it is in danger of being lost, removed, or materially injured [6]. While receivership is generally unnecessary in partition cases, it is justified when the facts show that the property is at risk or when "strained relations" between co-owners make common administration impossible [7, 8].

The Court affirmed the factual findings that the petitioners were disposing of conjugal properties to the prejudice of the respondent and that the minority co-owner was being deprived of income [4, 7]. The Court applied the doctrine in *Chunaco v. Quicho* and Article 492 of the Civil Code, which authorizes the appointment of an administrator when the acts of the majority co-owners result in serious prejudice to the minority [8, 9]. The petition was denied [10].
