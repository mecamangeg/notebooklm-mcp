I. CAPTION
MINDANAO MOTOR LINE, INC., ET AL. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-18418 & L-18419, November 29, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On May 5, 1955, the Mindanao Federation of Labor and several laid-off employees filed a complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP) against Mindanao Motor Line, Inc. (MML), its officers Jesus Moraza and Enrique Ponce, and Aboitiz & Co., alleging interference with their right to organize. Respondents claimed MML was distinct from Aboitiz and that the February 1, 1955 suspension of operations and subsequent layoffs were due to heavy financial losses.

The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found the respondents guilty of ULP. It ordered them to pay backwages to the employees from the date of dismissal (February 1, 1955) until the cancellation of MML's certificate of public convenience (June 10, 1958), without reinstatement, as the line had ceased operations. The CIR also held the corporate officers and Aboitiz & Co. liable. Petitioners appealed, arguing that backwages cannot be awarded without reinstatement and that the officers acted within their corporate authority.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N backwages can be awarded even if reinstatement is not ordered.
2. W/N corporate officers are personally liable for the ULP of the corporation.
3. W/N Aboitiz & Co. is liable as an employer.
4. W/N earnings from re-employment or other sources should be deducted from the backwages.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While the payment of backwages generally follows an order for reinstatement, the impossibility of reinstatement due to the discontinuance of service does not deprive employees of the wages they are entitled to when the employer is guilty of unfair labor practice. It is only fair that they be paid for the period they were deprived of employment [1].

2. **NO.** Officers Ponce and Moraza are not personally liable. They acted merely as agents within the scope of their authority as resident manager and general manager. Under Article 1897 of the Civil Code, an agent acting for a disclosed principal is not liable to third persons unless they acted negligently or in bad faith, which was not proven in this case [2].

3. **YES.** Aboitiz & Co. is liable. The evidence established a connection between the companies: they shared a common postal address, Aboitiz failed to deny that its Land Transportation Division controlled MML, and the suspension of operations was sparked by a letter from Aboitiz regarding financial losses [3, 4].

4. **YES.** To avoid double compensation, the 31 employees re-employed by MML in other lines are entitled to backwages only from the date of separation until their re-employment [5]. Furthermore, the employer may deduct earnings the employees obtained elsewhere during the period of separation in mitigation of damages [6].

The order of the Court of Industrial Relations is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS: excluding the officers from liability, limiting backwages for re-employed workers, and authorizing the set-off of other earnings [7].
