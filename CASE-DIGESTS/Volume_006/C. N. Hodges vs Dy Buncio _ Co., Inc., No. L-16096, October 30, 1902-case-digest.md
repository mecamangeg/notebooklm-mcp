I. CAPTION
C. N. HODGES v. DY BUNCIO & CO., INC. and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-16096, October 30, 1902, Padilla, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Veronica Bareza was the original owner of a parcel of land in Iloilo (Lot No. 3329) [2]. In 1927 and 1929, the land was sold successively to Go Po and then to Go Lao *alias* Diwa [2]. In 1936, Respondent Dy Buncio & Co., Inc. acquired the property through a public auction sale after attaching it in a civil case against Go Lao, obtaining Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-15148 (later T-4768) [2].

In 1950, Bareza filed a motion in the cadastral court claiming she had repurchased the land from Go Lao but lost the deed, and falsely alleged that Dy Buncio’s title was lost [3, 4]. The court ordered the issuance of a new title to Bareza, who then sold the land to Petitioner C. N. Hodges in April 1950 [4]. Hodges obtained TCTs for the subdivided lots [4]. In 1954, Dy Buncio discovered the fraud when attempting to pay real estate taxes [5]. In 1955, Dy Buncio filed an action to annul the 1950 court orders and Hodges’ titles, and to declare itself the owner [5].

Hodges argued that the action was barred by the four-year prescriptive period for fraud and claimed indefeasibility of title as an innocent purchaser [6, 7]. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Dy Buncio, declaring Hodges' titles null and void [8]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision [2, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action is barred by prescription.
2. W/N Petitioner Hodges is entitled to the protection of indefeasibility of title as an innocent purchaser.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The action is primarily for the recovery of title to real property, not merely for relief on the ground of fraud [10]. Under Section 40 of Act No. 190, an action for recovery of title to real property can be brought within ten years after the cause of action accrues [10]. The Court held that the action involved the jurisdiction of the cadastral court to cancel a valid, existing title [10].

2. **NO.** The principle of indefeasibility of title cannot be invoked by a person who bought land from one who procured title by means of fraud against a registered owner who was not negligent [7, 11]. Dy Buncio held a valid title and never parted with its owner's duplicate, nor did it perform any act that led to the issuance of the fraudulent title [7]. Furthermore, Hodges was not a purchaser in good faith [12]. His lawyer had verified records showing the land was formerly Dy Buncio’s and was acquired by Bareza via "Courts' order," facts that should have put a prudent man on guard to investigate further [12].

**Disposition:** Judgment affirmed [13].
