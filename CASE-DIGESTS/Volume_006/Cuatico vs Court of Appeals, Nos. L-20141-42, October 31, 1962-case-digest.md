I. CAPTION
JOAQUIN CUATICO, ET AL. v. COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-20141-42, October 31, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. filed an ejectment case against petitioner Joaquin Cuatico involving a parcel of land in the Tatalon Estate, Quezon City. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Tuason, ordering Cuatico to vacate. Cuatico appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA). Separately, Cuatico filed a complaint to compel Tuason to execute deeds of transfer for the lot, which was dismissed by the trial court and also appealed to the CA.

While these appeals were pending, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 3453, amending Section 4 of Republic Act No. 2616. The amendment provided that upon approval of the Act, "no ejectment proceedings shall be instituted or prosecuted against the present occupants... and no ejectment proceedings already commenced shall be continued." Invoking this law, Cuatico petitioned the CA to suspend the proceedings. The CA denied the suspension. Cuatico appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the CA abused its discretion. Tuason contended that R.A. No. 3453 is unconstitutional as it amounts to confiscation of property.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Section 4 of Republic Act No. 3453, which mandates the suspension of ejectment proceedings upon its approval regardless of the status of expropriation, is constitutional.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the provision is unconstitutional and unenforceable. The Court reasoned that R.A. No. 3453 allows the continuance of the tenant's occupation "indefinitely even if no expropriation proceedings are taken or contemplated." This effectively deprives the owner of their dominical rights of possession, enjoyment, and disposition without just compensation and due process, which is confiscatory.

Citing *J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, the Court reiterated that ejectment proceedings cannot be barred or suspended under the Tatalon Estate expropriation laws unless: (a) an action for expropriation is actually filed; (b) the government takes possession of the land; and (c) coetaneous payment of just compensation is made. Since R.A. No. 3453 brushes aside these constitutional requirements for eminent domain, it is invalid.

The resolutions of the Court of Appeals denying the suspension were affirmed.
