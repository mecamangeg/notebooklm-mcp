I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CAUSIANO ENOT and PABLO VIÑALON, G.R. No. L-17530, October 30, 1962, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On July 8, 1960, in Masbate, accused Causiano Enot and Pablo Viñalon conspired and entered the house of Macario Conje at night. With intent to gain, they stole a trunk and a fighting cock valued at P35.00. On this occasion, utilizing bolos, they attacked the sleeping family, killing Macario, Maximina Arreglado, Monina Conje, and a 7-month-old baby whose head was hacked in two. They also injured 5-year-old Santiaga Conje [1-3]. Upon arraignment in the Court of First Instance of Masbate, both accused pleaded guilty [4]. The trial court found them guilty of robbery with multiple homicide and physical injuries, sentencing them to death [5]. On automatic review, the accused argued the penalty should be reduced to *reclusion perpetua*, claiming the court failed to appreciate the mitigating circumstances of intoxication and lack of instruction, and erred in appreciating nocturnity and evident premeditation as aggravating circumstances [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N intoxication should be appreciated as a mitigating circumstance.
2. W/N lack of instruction is a mitigating circumstance in this case.
3. W/N nocturnity should be treated as a separate aggravating circumstance from treachery.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The fact of intoxication must be proved to the satisfaction of the court to be available as a mitigating circumstance [6]. The accused made no offer to show they were drunk to the point of losing reason and self-control, nor was it shown that drinking was not habitual. An extrajudicial confession mentioning drinking, which was not offered as an exhibit, cannot be considered [6].

2. **NO.** Lack of instruction is not applicable to crimes of theft or robbery, and much less to the crime of homicide [7]. The Court held that "no one, however, unschooled he may be, is so ignorant as not to know that theft or robbery, or assault upon the person of another, is inherently wrong and a violation of the law" [7].

3. **NO.** Nocturnity should not be taken as an aggravating circumstance separate and independent of treachery because it forms part of the peculiar treacherous means and manner adopted to insure the execution of the crime [8]. However, the crime remains aggravated by treachery, superior strength, disregard of sex and age (victims were women and children), evident premeditation, and dwelling [8, 9].

**Decision AFFIRMED.** The death sentence is imposed, and the accused are ordered to pay P6,000 to the heirs of each victim [3].
