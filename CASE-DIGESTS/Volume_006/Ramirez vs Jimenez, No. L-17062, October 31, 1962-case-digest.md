I. CAPTION
MARIANO S. RAMIREZ Y LOCSIN v. HON. DAMIAN L. JIMENEZ, THE SHERIFF OF QUEZON CITY, and J. M. TUASON & Co., INC., G.R. No. L-17062, October 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. filed a forcible entry case against petitioner Mariano Ramirez in the Municipal Court of Quezon City (Civil Case No. 5466). During the pendency of the case, Ramirez filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition (Civil Case No. Q-4786) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon City against Judge Jimenez, which was dismissed for being the wrong remedy. Ramirez did not appeal this dismissal. Subsequently, Ramirez filed a second petition for certiorari and prohibition (Civil Case No. Q-5030) in the same CFI to review orders of the Municipal Court and suspend proceedings. The CFI dismissed this second petition on the ground that the proper remedy was appeal, not certiorari. Meanwhile, the Municipal Court rendered a decision in the main forcible entry case ordering Ramirez to vacate. Ramirez failed to appeal the Municipal Court's decision, allowing it to become final and executory. Ramirez then appealed the CFI's orders dismissing his second certiorari petition to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for certiorari and prohibition was properly dismissed on the ground that appeal was the available remedy.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. Under Section 1, Rule 67 (now Rule 65), a writ of certiorari will lie only when a tribunal has acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion and there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law [1]. The Municipal Court had jurisdiction over the subject matter (forcible entry) and the person of the petitioner [1]. Therefore, any questions or alleged errors pertained to the exercise of jurisdiction and should have been corrected by appeal, not certiorari [1]. The Court held that certiorari cannot be used as a substitute for appeal (*Profeta vs. Gutierrez David*) [1]. Petitioner could have timely appealed the Municipal Court’s decision but allowed it to lapse into finality [1].

The Orders of the court *a quo* are affirmed [2].
