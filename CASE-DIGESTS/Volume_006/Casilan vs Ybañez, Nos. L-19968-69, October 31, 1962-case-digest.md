I. CAPTION
ALIPIO N. CASILAN and THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF LEYTE v. HON. FILOMENO B. YBAÑEZ, ANTONIO MONTILLA, HIPOLITA D. CHAPMAN and PAZ B. TIONGZON, G.R. Nos. L-19968-69, October 31, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alipio Casilan obtained a judgment for P15,000 against Hipolita Chapman in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon City. A writ of execution was issued, and the Provincial Sheriff of Leyte levied on Chapman’s properties on March 25, 1961. Before the sheriff's sale could proceed, respondents Antonio Montilla (claiming to be a prior judgment creditor) and Paz B. Tiongzon (a mortgagee) filed separate actions in the CFI of Leyte claiming preference over the properties. The CFI of Leyte issued writs of preliminary injunction restraining the sale and, on March 21, 1962, rendered a decision on the merits declaring Casilan’s levy subordinate to Montilla and Tiongzon’s claims, making the injunctions permanent. Casilan filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, arguing the CFI of Leyte unlawfully interfered with the judgment of a coordinate court (CFI Quezon City).

III. ISSUE/S
W/N certiorari is the proper remedy to review the trial court's judgment declaring the preference of credits and making the injunction permanent.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that it can no longer interfere with the writ of preliminary injunction as it had been vacated and superseded by the permanent injunction ordered in the decision on the merits [1, 2]. Regarding the permanent injunction, which resulted from a finding on the order of priorities of credits, the trial court had the jurisdiction to determine such questions of preference [3]. Any error in the trial court's findings would constitute errors of law correctible by appeal, not abuses of discretion correctible by certiorari [3]. Since the petitioner failed to file a timely appeal to the Court of Appeals, the judgment became final and unappealable and cannot be set aside through certiorari proceedings [4].

Petition for a writ of certiorari is denied [4].
