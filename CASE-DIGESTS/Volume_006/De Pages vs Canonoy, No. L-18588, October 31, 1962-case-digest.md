I. CAPTION
INES R. DE PAGES, et al. v. HON. MATEO CANONOY, et al., G.R. No. L-18588, October 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners (De Pages, et al.) filed an unlawful detainer case against private respondents (Laurente and Cañizares) in the Municipal Court of Cebu City. The court ruled in favor of petitioners, ordering respondents to pay P3,150 in back rentals, vacate the premises, and pay P225 monthly rent starting March 1961. Respondents appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) presided by Respondent Judge Canonoy. However, respondents failed to file the required supersedeas bond and failed to pay the monthly rentals for March and April 1961.

Petitioners filed a motion for immediate execution of the Municipal Court's judgment. Judge Canonoy granted execution only for the rentals from March 1, 1961, but allowed respondents to file a supersedeas bond for the back rentals within five days, effectively denying the immediate execution regarding the arrears and the restoration of possession. Petitioners moved for reconsideration, arguing that under the Rules of Court, they were entitled to full execution. Judge Canonoy denied the motion, claiming it was within his discretion to allow the bond filing.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs are entitled to the immediate execution of the entire judgment (restitution of possession and payment of arrears) upon the defendants' failure to file a supersedeas bond and pay current rentals pending appeal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that in actions for unlawful detainer, if the inferior court renders judgment against the defendant and the latter appeals to the CFI, the failure to file a supersedeas bond and/or to pay on time the monthly reasonable value of the use of the property entitles the plaintiff, as a matter of right, to the immediate execution of the judgment. This right covers both the payment of rents and the restoration of possession under Section 8, Rule 72 of the Rules of Court.

The Court emphasized that upon such failure by the defendant, the duty of the court to order execution is "ministerial and imperative" (*Perez v. Hernandez*; *Lopez, Inc. v. Philippine Trading*). Consequently, the respondent Judge had no discretion to allow the late filing of the bond or stay the execution.

The orders complained of are set aside, and the respondent Judge is ordered to issue a writ for the execution of the judgment rendered by the Municipal Court.
