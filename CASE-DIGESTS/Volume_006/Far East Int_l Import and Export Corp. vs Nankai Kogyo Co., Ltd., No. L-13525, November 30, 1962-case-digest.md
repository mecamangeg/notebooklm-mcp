I. CAPTION
FAR EAST INTERNATIONAL IMPORT and EXPORT CORPORATION v. NANKAI KOGYO CO., LTD., G.R. No. L-13525, November 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On December 26, 1956, Far East International Import & Export Corporation (Far East), a domestic corporation, entered into a contract of sale of steel scrap with Nankai Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Nankai), a Japanese corporation [1]. Nankai opened a Letter of Credit, but due to the expiration of Far East's export license, only 1,058.6 metric tons were loaded onto the ship *SS Mina* before operations ceased [2, 3]. Nankai obtained the Bill of Lading directly from the ship's Master, bypassing Far East, and used it to claim the cargo [4]. Consequently, Far East could not collect payment against the Letter of Credit [5, 6]. Far East filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila for specific performance and damages [5].

Nankai filed a Special Appearance to dismiss the complaint, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction over its person as it was not "doing business" in the Philippines [4, 7]. The CFI denied the motion. Nankai then filed an Answer alleging non-jurisdictional grounds and defenses, and participated in the trial on the merits [6, 8]. The CFI ruled in favor of Far East, ordering Nankai to pay the value of the scrap [9]. Nankai appealed, reiterating the jurisdictional defect [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the person of the foreign corporation Nankai.

IV. RULING
**YES**. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that jurisdiction was acquired on three grounds [10].

First, there was valid service of summons. Under Section 14, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court, service upon a foreign corporation may be made on "any officer or agent within the Philippines" [11]. Service was effected on Nankai’s Trade Manager (Mr. Ishida) and Chief of Petroleum Section (Mr. Tominaga), who were present in Manila to sign the contract and manage the transaction [12].

Second, Nankai was found to be "doing business" in the Philippines. While a single transaction is generally insufficient, Nankai's acts were not merely incidental or casual. Its officers were sent to the Philippines to look into mining operations, indicating a purpose to do other business and make the Philippines a basis of operations [13].

Third, Nankai voluntarily submitted to the court's jurisdiction. Although it initially objected via Special Appearance, Nankai subsequently filed an Answer invoking non-jurisdictional grounds and presented evidence on the merits to resist the claim [14]. The Court ruled that even if a defendant objects to jurisdiction, seeking affirmative relief on other grounds or participating in the trial constitutes a waiver of the objection and submission to the court's authority [15, 16].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [10].
