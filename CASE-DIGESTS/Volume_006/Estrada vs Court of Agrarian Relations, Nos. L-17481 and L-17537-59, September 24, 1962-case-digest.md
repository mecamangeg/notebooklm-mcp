I. CAPTION
LIBERATA ANTONIO ESTRADA, ET AL. v. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS and FAUSTINO F. GALVAN, G.R. Nos. L-17481 and L-17537-59, September 24, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On August 15, 1961, the Supreme Court issued an order directing respondent Faustino F. Galvan and the manager of the Moncada Bonded Warehouse to release and deliver specific shares of palay (10% of the first crop and 15% of the second crop, less certain amounts) to petitioners Estrada, et al. On January 21, 1962, petitioners filed a motion to declare respondents in contempt, alleging failure to deliver the shares as ordered. Galvan opposed the motion, claiming the order had been complied with. Petitioners subsequently filed a manifestation stating the exact amounts were not delivered. The conflict presented a factual dispute regarding the actual delivery of the palay.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the reception of evidence is necessary to resolve the motion for contempt.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the issues raised in the motion to declare respondents in contempt and the opposition thereto involve questions of fact—specifically, the determination of whether the respective shares of the petitioners and respondents have actually been delivered [1, 2]. Because the resolution of the motion requires factual verification, the Court referred the records to the Court of Agrarian Relations in Moncada, Tarlac, to receive evidence from the parties in support of their respective claims [1, 2]. The lower court was ordered to conduct the necessary hearing and submit its report and recommendation within 90 days [2].

Case referred to the Court of Agrarian Relations for reception of evidence.
