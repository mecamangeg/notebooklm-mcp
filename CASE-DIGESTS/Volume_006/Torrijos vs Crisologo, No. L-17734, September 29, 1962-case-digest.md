I. CAPTION
ANTONIO TORRIJOS v. GUILLERMO CRISOLOGO, ANASTACIO CRISOLOGO and THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-17734, September 29, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Torrijos purchased a parcel of land from respondents Crisologos with a right to repurchase. In a previous litigation (Civil Case No. 170), a final judgment recognized the Crisologos' right to repurchase the property for the fixed sum of P19,313.95 within a period of 60 days. On May 12, 1956, within the 60-day period, the Crisologos offered to redeem the property, but Torrijos (through his wife) refused the tender. Consequently, the Crisologos deposited only P2,000 with the Clerk of Court as an "initial amount" to comply with the deadline, promising to pay the balance later.

The Court of Appeals (CA) originally affirmed the trial court's ruling against the Crisologos, reasoning that the deposit of only P2,000 proved they did not have the full redemption price. However, in an Amended Decision, the CA reversed itself, ruling that the petitioner's refusal to accept the tender preserved the vendors' right of action regardless of the deposit, and granted a new 30-day period for redemption. Torrijos appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondents validly exercised their right of redemption fixed by final judgment when they deposited less than the full amount after their tender was refused.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the Amended Decision and affirmed the original CA decision. The Court reasoned that the previous final judgment definitively fixed the relationship of the parties as creditor and debtor for a specific amount and period. Under **Article 1256 of the Civil Code**, if a creditor refuses tender of payment without just cause, the debtor is released from responsibility only by the consignation of the *sum due*.

The Court held that the law contemplates the return or tender of nothing less than the **full amount** of the redemption price [1, 2] (citing *Angao v. Clavano*). The respondents' deposit of only P2,000 created grave doubts that they actually possessed the required P19,313.95 [3]. Furthermore, the CA's ruling that the refusal suspended the period was deemed absurd, as it would allow a final judgment fixing a redemption date to be extended indefinitely by repeated offers and refusals [4, 5]. To preserve their rights, the respondents were obliged to consign the full amount with the court upon the petitioner's refusal.
