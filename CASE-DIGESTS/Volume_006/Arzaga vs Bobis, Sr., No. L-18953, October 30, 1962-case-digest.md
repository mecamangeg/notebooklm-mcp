I. CAPTION
EMILIO ARZAGA v. FRANCISCO BOBIS, SR., G.R. No. L-18953, October 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In the 1959 general elections for Mayor of El Nido, Palawan, the municipal board of canvassers proclaimed petitioner Emilio Arzaga the winner by 2 votes. Respondent Francisco Bobis, Sr. protested. The Court of First Instance affirmed Arzaga’s victory. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the decision and declared Bobis the winner by 5 votes. Arzaga filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court to review the CA’s appreciation of 21 specific ballots involving alleged markings and the application of the *idem sonans* rule.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N votes containing names like "F. Vuvis", "F. Pabes", and "F. Bobkis" are valid for Bobis under the *idem sonans* rule.
2. W/N ballots containing indecent words, derogatory terms, or a name written three or more times are marked and invalid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under the *idem sonans* rule (Sec. 149, par. 2, Revised Election Code), a name incorrectly written which has a sound similar to the real name of the candidate shall be counted in his favor. The Court held that "F. Vuvis", "F. Pabes", "F. Babes", and "F. Bobkis" are *idem sonans* with Francisco Bobis, Sr. and are valid votes. However, the Court ruled that "F. Boslro" bears no similarity to Bobis and is not counted.

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the use of indecent words (e.g., "Potang ena mo", "Berat") invalidates the ballot as marked. Similarly, the use of the derogatory word "lagare" (meaning a person who profits from both sides) on three ballots from the same precinct implies an intent to mark. Furthermore, while writing a candidate's name in *two* spaces is merely a stray vote (Rule 3, Sec. 149), writing a name three or more times (e.g., "S. Sumurraga" written three times) renders the ballot invalid as marked, citing *Gutierrez v. Aquino*. Conversely, the use of nicknames and expressions of respect (e.g., "Kiko Padrieno") or the inclusion of stray votes (e.g., "Perez Bungcad") without evidence *aliunde* of intent to mark does not invalidate the ballot.

Decision affirmed with modification. Respondent Bobis, Sr. is declared elected with a majority of five votes.
