I. CAPTION
MERCEDES AGDOMA, EUGENIA AGDOMA and PEDRO AGDOMA v. ATTY. ISAIAS A. CELESTINO, Adm. Case No. 289, November 29, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners are the aunts and uncle of Respondent Atty. Isaias A. Celestino. Julian Agdoma, the father of Petitioners and grandfather of Respondent, died on July 23, 1945 [1]. Ten years later, on August 16, 1955, Respondent filed an *ex parte* petition in the CFI of Pangasinan representing his deceased grandfather as alive [2]. He sought a new owner's duplicate of OCT No. 62507, claiming the original was burned, and supported this with an affidavit purportedly subscribed and sworn to by the deceased Julian Agdoma before Respondent himself as notary public [2].

Respondent also produced a deed of absolute sale dated two days prior, making it appear that Julian Agdoma sold the land to him for P1,000, acknowledged before a fictitious notary public named Julio B. Pequet [3]. Based on these documents, the Register of Deeds issued TCT No. 18925 in Respondent's name, which he subsequently mortgaged to the Philippine National Bank for P425 [3]. The residence certificate used in the falsified documents actually belonged to a certain Mrs. Angela Eslava [4].

Petitioners filed a disbarment complaint for malpractice. Respondent failed to appear during the investigation by the Provincial Fiscal despite notices, leading the Fiscal to find him guilty of malpractice [5, 6]. The Solicitor General filed a formal complaint with the Supreme Court, but Respondent failed to answer and his whereabouts remained unknown [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent should be disbarred for malpractice and gross misconduct.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that Respondent committed wanton falsehoods in court. He presented himself as counsel for his grandfather whom he knew had been dead for ten years, filed a petition on the deceased's behalf, and notarized a fake affidavit of the deceased [4]. These acts, along with the forgery of the deed of sale using a fictitious notary and a false residence certificate, constitute a wanton disregard for truth and honesty [4].

Furthermore, Respondent's failure to appear or reveal his whereabouts during the proceedings implies a waiver of his right to defend himself [8]. The Court emphasized that a lawyer must be available to the court for a fair trial when facing disbarment [8].

Respondent Isaias A. Celestino is disbarred from the practice of the legal profession [9].
