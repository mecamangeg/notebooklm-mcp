I. CAPTION
CARIDAD CABARROGUIS v. HON. LOURDES P. SAN DIEGO, G.R. No. L-19517, November 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cabarroguis was charged with estafa. During the trial on February 28, 1962, the complainant testified that the transaction involved a loan of P7,800 to be returned in goods [1]. Based on this, respondent Judge San Diego verbally dictated an order in open court dismissing the case, believing the facts did not constitute estafa [2]. The prosecution immediately sought reconsideration to prove intent to defraud, and the Judge withdrew the verbal order to allow further examination of the witness [3]. Petitioner's counsel did not object at that time and proceeded to cross-examine the complainant [3], [4]. It was only on March 7, 1962, that petitioner moved to set aside the withdrawal, claiming the verbal dismissal was an acquittal and resuming trial placed her in double jeopardy [5]. The motion was denied, leading to this petition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the withdrawal of a verbal order of dismissal places the accused in double jeopardy.
2. W/N the accused waived the right against double jeopardy by failing to object immediately.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A verbal order of dismissal is incomplete and does not have the effect of acquitting the accused. The Court ruled that under Section 2, Rule 116 of the Rules of Court, a judgment "must be written... personally and directly prepared by the judge, and signed by him" [6], [7]. Since the order was never put in writing nor signed by the Judge before it was withdrawn, it did not effectively dismiss the case [7]. Consequently, continuing the trial did not place the petitioner in double jeopardy [8].

2. **YES.** Even assuming the verbal order was valid, the petitioner waived her constitutional right against double jeopardy. The Court held that her failure to object to the prosecution's motion for reconsideration and the subsequent cross-examination of the complainant amounted to a waiver (citing *People v. Casiano*) [9], [4]. The objection raised a week later was deemed too late [4].

The petition is **DISMISSED** [10].
