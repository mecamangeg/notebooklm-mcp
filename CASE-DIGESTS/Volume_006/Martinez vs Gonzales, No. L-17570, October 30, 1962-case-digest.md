I. CAPTION
ROSALINA MARTINEZ v. AURELIA GONZALES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17570, October 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On July 15, 1958, petitioner Rosalina Martinez, a filing clerk, boarded a "Banner" taxicab owned by respondent Aurelia Gonzales and driven by respondent Luis Fornal [1, 2]. While at the intersection of O'Donnel and Mayhaligue streets in Manila, the taxi bumped a "Golden" taxicab, causing Martinez to fall from her seat and lose consciousness [2]. She suffered physical injuries and incurred P150.00 in medical expenses [2]. Martinez filed an action for damages in the Court of First Instance of Manila based on breach of contract of carriage [1, 3]. The trial court rendered judgment awarding her P150.00 as compensatory damages and P200.00 as attorney's fees but denied her claim for moral and exemplary damages [4]. Martinez appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as the facts were uncontroverted [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Martinez is entitled to moral damages based on a breach of contract of carriage.
2. W/N Martinez is entitled to exemplary damages.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that moral damages are not recoverable in actions predicated on a breach of contract of transportation [5]. A breach of contract is not included in the descriptive term "analogous cases" under Article 2219 of the New Civil Code, as Article 2220 specifically governs contractual breaches and Article 2176 excludes pre-existing contractual relations [3]. The only exceptions where moral damages are allowed in transport contracts are: (1) where the mishap results in the death of a passenger, or (2) where the carrier is guilty of fraud or bad faith [5]. Martinez did not allege fraud, malice, or bad faith, but merely predicated her action on the failure of the carrier to bring her safely to her destination due to an accident [6].

2. **NO.** The Court held that since Martinez is not entitled to moral damages, she is likewise not entitled to exemplary damages [6]. To recover exemplary damages, a party must first show entitlement to moral, temperate, liquidated, or compensatory damages [6]. In this context, without evidence of the bad faith or malice required for moral damages, the claim for exemplary damages fails.

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED [7].
