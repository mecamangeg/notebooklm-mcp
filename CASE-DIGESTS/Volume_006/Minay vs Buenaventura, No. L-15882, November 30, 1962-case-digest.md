I. CAPTION
EULOGIA MINAY, ET AL. v. BARTOLOME BUENAVENTURA and MARIA JANDUSAY, G.R. No. L-15882, November 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On November 30, 1950, plaintiffs-appellees (Minay, et al.) executed a Deed of Absolute Sale of a house and lot in Boac, Marinduque, in favor of defendant-appellant Bartolome Buenaventura for P4,500.00 [1, 2]. The terms stipulated that P1,250.00 was paid, with a balance of P3,250.00 due within five years; failure to pay would revert the property to the sellers [2, 3]. After the five-year period lapsed without payment, plaintiffs filed an action for rescission and recovery in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Oriental Mindoro [3].

The CFI rendered judgment declaring the deed null and void and ordering defendants to return the property and pay attorney's fees [4]. Defendants appealed directly to the Supreme Court, raising four errors involving questions of fact (e.g., whether full payment was made) and law [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court found that most of the errors assigned by the appellants presented questions of fact [6]. Furthermore, the value of the property in litigation was only P4,500.00, which was far below the jurisdictional amount required for the Supreme Court to exercise appellate jurisdiction at that time [6].

Under Section 17 (5), (6), and Section 29 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended, the case falls within the proper jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals [6].

Records of the case were remanded to the Court of Appeals for proper disposition [6, 7].
