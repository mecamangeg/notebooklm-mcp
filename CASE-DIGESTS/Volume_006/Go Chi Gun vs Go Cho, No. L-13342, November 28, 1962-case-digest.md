I. CAPTION
GO CHI GUN, et al. v. GO CHO, et al., G.R. No. L-13342, November 28, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In 1949, plaintiffs Go Chi Gun, et al. filed a case (Civil Case No. 5436) claiming to be heirs of the deceased Go Checo and requested the appointment of a receiver for certain properties. The trial court appointed a receiver, which the Supreme Court upheld in G.R. No. 3937. On the merits, the trial court ruled for the plaintiffs, annulling a 1916 project of partition. However, on appeal (G.R. No. L-5208), the Supreme Court reversed the decision and ruled in favor of the defendants "with costs against plaintiffs-appellees."

Upon the return of the records, the defendants filed a bill of costs, including P5,000.00 for the receiver’s compensation. The Clerk of Court approved the items. On appeal to the judge, the court charged P1,000.00 of the compensation to the defendants (reasoning that the receivership prevented foreclosure of some properties) and P4,000.00 to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs appealed, arguing they should not be liable for the receiver's compensation.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the receiver's compensation may be charged against the defeated party (plaintiffs) as part of the costs.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the lower court's order. Under the Rules of Court, courts have the power to grant the receiver reasonable compensation after the termination of the receivership proceeding. This compensation may be "taxed as costs against the defeated party, or apportioned between the parties, as justice requires" [1, 2].

The Supreme Court found no reason to disapprove the lower court's exercise of discretion in apportioning the costs (P4,000 to plaintiffs and P1,000 to defendants) [3, 4]. The Court explicitly rejected the plaintiffs' reliance on American decisions suggesting compensation should be paid from funds under receivership, stating that such decisions cannot prevail over the clear provisions of the Rules of Court [4].

The order appealed from is affirmed [5].
