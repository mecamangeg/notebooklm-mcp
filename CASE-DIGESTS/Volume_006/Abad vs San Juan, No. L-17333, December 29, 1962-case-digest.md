I. CAPTION
JULIANA ABAD and SINAI C. HAMADA v. BLAS SAN JUAN, G.R. No. L-17333, December 29, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In Civil Case No. 288, Blas San Juan (defendant-appellant) and Juliana Abad (plaintiff-appellee) entered into a compromise agreement with the Intestate Estate of Sioco Cariño. The agreement provided that a portion of Lot No. 117-B would be adjudicated equally to Juliana, as the surviving spouse of the late Vicente San Juan, and to Blas, as the surviving son. This compromise was embodied in a decision by the Court of First Instance of Baguio dated May 4, 1954, which subsequently became final.

When Blas refused to abide by the partition, Juliana filed the instant suit to enforce the judgment. Blas contended that the compromise was obtained through fraud, claiming he possessed documents showing his father never married Juliana and that Cariño never owned the land. The trial court rejected Blas's contentions and ordered the partition. Blas appealed, arguing the decision was void under Article 2035 of the Civil Code because it involved a compromise regarding civil status.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the judgment based on the compromise agreement is void under Article 2035 of the Civil Code for validating a civil status.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that Article 2035 of the Civil Code, which prohibits compromises on civil status and validity of marriage, is inapplicable [1, 2]. The main issue in the original Civil Case No. 288 was not the relationship between Juliana and the deceased Vicente, but whether Vicente had validly purchased and possessed the disputed lot from Sioco Cariño [1, 3]. The pleadings in that case specifically alleged Juliana was the widow, a fact admitted by the defendants and never denied by Blas at the time [2, 3]. Thus, her status was not the subject matter of the compromise [3].

Furthermore, even if the judgment were theoretically erroneous due to the compromise, it was not void because the trial court had jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties [4]. Since Blas failed to appeal the original decision, it became final and executory [4]. The decision appealed from is affirmed [5].
