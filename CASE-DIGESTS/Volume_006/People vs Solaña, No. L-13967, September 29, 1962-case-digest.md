I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GENARO SOLAÑA, WENCESLAO SOLAÑA, FRUTO SOLAÑA and CRISPINO SOBOSA, G.R. No. L-13967, September 29, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of January 3, 1956, in Leganes, Iloilo, Santiago Sobrevega was attacked and killed. Prosecution witness Cayetano Sunio positively identified the four accused—Genaro, Wenceslao, and Fruto Solaña, and Crispino Sobosa—forcibly dragging and manhandling the victim [1]. The accused admitted their participation in the assault but claimed self-defense [2]. They alleged that while guarding the house of Alejo Provido, they were attacked by robbers. Genaro claimed the victim lunged at him with a butcher's knife, forcing him to strike back with a bolo. The other accused then attacked the victim with clubs and a scabbard, believing he was a dangerous robber [3]. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo rejected their version, convicted them of murder, and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua* [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused proved self-defense to justify the killing.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, ruling that the plea of self-defense must be supported by clear and convincing proof [5]. The Court found the alleged robbery to be a "thinly veiled concoction" and devoid of truth [6]. Furthermore, even if the defense's version were true that the victim lunged at Genaro, the subsequent attacks by the other appellants—after the victim had already been boloed, whirled around, and fallen helplessly—constituted *alevosia* (treachery) and were inconsistent with self-defense [7, 8]. The continued assault when the victim was no longer a risk qualified the crime to murder. The Court also reiterated that motive is unessential to conviction when there is no doubt as to the identity of the culprits, especially when they admitted to the act [9].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [10].
