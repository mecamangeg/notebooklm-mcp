I. CAPTION
RUBEN O. SANGALANG v. BRIGIDA VERGARA, G.R. No. L-16174, October 30, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant Vergara was appointed as a clerk in the Office of the City Fiscal of Manila by the Secretary of Justice on March 28, 1958. Plaintiff Sangalang was subsequently appointed to the same position by the Mayor of Manila on February 1, 1959. Sangalang filed a petition for *quo warranto* against Vergara, claiming the Mayor had the authority to appoint clerks in the Fiscal's office under the Revised Charter of Manila (R.A. No. 409). The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Sangalang, ordering Vergara to vacate the position, holding that the Office of the City Fiscal remained a department of the city government subject to the Mayor's appointment power. Vergara appealed to the Supreme Court [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Mayor of Manila has the power to appoint clerks in the Office of the City Fiscal [2].

IV. RULING
**NO.** The power to appoint clerks in the Office of the City Fiscal is vested in the Secretary of Justice, not the City Mayor.

The Court held that Section 20 of the Revised Charter of Manila, as amended by Republic Act No. 1201, expressly provides that the Office of the City Fiscal "shall be under the Department of Justice." This amendment effectively withdrew the Fiscal's office from the list of city departments under the direct supervision and control of the Mayor [5, 6]. To hold otherwise would render the amendatory phrase meaningless [7].

Applying the principle in *Lacson v. Villafranca*, the Court emphasized that the administration of justice is a matter of national, not local, concern, and the legislative intent was to minimize political interference [8]. Consequently, under Section 79(D) of the Revised Administrative Code, the power to appoint subordinate officers and employees in said office lies with the Department Head (Secretary of Justice) upon the recommendation of the bureau chief [9].

The decision of the Court of First Instance was REVERSED [9].
