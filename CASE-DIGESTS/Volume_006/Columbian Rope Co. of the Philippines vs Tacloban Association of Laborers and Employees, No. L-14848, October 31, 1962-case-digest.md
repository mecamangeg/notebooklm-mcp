I. CAPTION
COLUMBIAN ROPE COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES, ET AL. v. TACLOBAN ASSOCIATION OF LABORERS AND EMPLOYEES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14848, October 31, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Malpas, Superable, de la Rosa, and Macamay were employees of the Tacloban branch of petitioner Columbian Rope Company. They were dismissed between September 1954 and February 1955 due to their membership in respondent Union. Consequently, an unfair labor practice (ULP) case was filed. Pending the case, the Company petitioned to close its Tacloban branch due to continued losses, allegedly effective September 30, 1955. On September 22, 1958, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found the Company guilty of ULP and ordered it to cease and desist, pay back wages from the time of dismissal, and reinstate the complainants. The Company did not question the ULP finding or the back wages up to the date of the alleged closure but argued that it could not be ordered to reinstate employees or pay back wages after the branch had supposedly closed. The CIR decision did not make a finding regarding the actual date or legitimacy of the closure.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the employer may be ordered to reinstate employees and pay back wages for the period after the closure of its branch office.

IV. RULING
**NO**, provided the closure was for legitimate business reasons. The Supreme Court held that back wages should not extend beyond the date of closure where such closure was due to legitimate business reasons and not merely an attempt to defeat the order of reinstatement (*Durable Shoe Factory v. CIR*). Regarding reinstatement, if the closure is legitimate, the employer cannot be compelled to reinstate employees in the closed branch but may be required to reinstate them in other branches if positions are available, or place them on a preferential hiring list (*56 C.J.S. 338*).

However, because the lower court failed to make factual findings on whether the Tacloban branch actually closed on September 30, 1955, and whether such closure was justified or merely a circumvention of the reinstatement order, the Supreme Court could not apply the rule definitively. Thus, the CIR decision was **SET ASIDE** and the case **REMANDED** to receive evidence on the veracity and justification of the closure.
