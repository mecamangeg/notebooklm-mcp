I. CAPTION
CASIANO U. LAPUT v. ATTY. FRANCISCO E.F. REMOTIGUE and ATTY. FORTUNATO R. PATALINGHUG, Adm. Case No. 219, September 29, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
In May 1952, petitioner Atty. Casiano Laput was retained by Nieves Rillas Vda. de Barrera to handle the "Testate Estate of Macario Barrera" [1]. By January 1955, Laput prepared pleadings to close the proceedings, but the client refused to sign them due to loss of trust, suspecting Laput of mishandling dividend checks and unauthorized bank withdrawals [1, 2]. On January 11, 1955, respondent Atty. Patalinghug entered his appearance as new counsel for the widow [1]. Subsequently, on February 5, 1955, Laput voluntarily asked the court to be relieved as counsel and simultaneously filed a motion for attorney's fees [1, 3]. Respondent Atty. Remotigue entered his appearance on February 7, 1955 [4]. Laput filed an administrative complaint charging respondents with unprofessional conduct for soliciting cases and intriguing against a brother lawyer, alleging they induced the client to revoke his power of attorney [1, 4]. The Solicitor General investigated and recommended exoneration, finding the client had already discharged Laput before Patalinghug appeared [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent lawyers are guilty of unprofessional and unethical conduct for entering their appearance and handling the case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court found no irregularity in the appearance of Atty. Patalinghug, as his services were validly contracted by the widow who had lost confidence in the petitioner [3]. The Court held that petitioner's voluntary withdrawal as counsel on February 5, 1955, combined with his filing of a motion for attorney's fees, amounted to an acquiescence to the appearance of Atty. Patalinghug [3]. This act estopped the petitioner from claiming the appearance was unprofessional [3]. Regarding Atty. Remotigue, he was not guilty of unprofessional conduct as he entered his appearance only after the petitioner had already voluntarily withdrawn [5]. The preparation of documents revoking petitioner's power of attorney was found to be without malice and purely to safeguard the client's interests [5].

Case dismissed [6].
