I. CAPTION
VICTORIA D. MIAILHE, ET AL. v. RUFINO P. HALILI AND HON. CONRADO VASQUEZ, G.R. No. L-16587, October 31, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Miailhe et al. obtained a judgment for P74,400.00 against respondent Halili in the Court of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 22152). Pending Halili's appeal, petitioners obtained a writ of execution because Halili failed to post a supersedeas bond. The Sheriff levied on Halili's properties, published notices of sale in two newspapers, and sold the properties. On appeal, the Supreme Court modified the judgment, reducing Halili's liability to P46,800.00.

Petitioners returned the excess amount collected to Halili but deducted two items: (1) sheriff's fees and publication expenses incurred during the execution; and (2) the sum of P2,004.28, representing a separate judgment petitioners won against Halili in another case (Civil Case No. 28062), which was then pending appeal. Halili moved for the return of these deductions. The trial court granted Halili's motion, ruling that he was not liable for the execution expenses and that compensation could not take place. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the judgment debtor is liable for sheriff's fees and publication expenses incurred during execution pending appeal when the judgment is subsequently modified.
2. W/N legal compensation can take place regarding a claim that is still the subject of pending litigation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the judgment debtor is liable for the necessary expenses of execution. The writ expressly commanded the Sheriff to collect the judgment "together with your lawful fees." Despite the modification of the judgment amount on appeal, Halili remained the judgment debtor. The "no costs" clause in the appellate decision referred only to costs in the Supreme Court, not execution expenses below. Under Sections 16 and 18 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, publication of the notice of sale is a mandatory requirement; thus, expenditures for it are necessary incidents of execution and form part of the "accruing costs" which the debtor must satisfy.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that compensation could not take place because petitioners' claim for P2,004.28 against Halili was still the subject of court litigation (pending appeal). Citing *Cia Gen. de Tabacos v. French*, the Court held that for compensation to take place, the amount involved must be certain and liquidated. Since the claim was under appeal, it was not yet liquidated and could not be used to offset the amount petitioners owed Halili.

The orders of the respondent Judge were revoked as to the execution expenses (which petitioners may charge to respondent) but affirmed as to the P2,004.28 (which petitioners must return).
