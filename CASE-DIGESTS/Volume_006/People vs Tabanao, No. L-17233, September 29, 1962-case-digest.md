I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. TORIBIO C. TABANAO, G.R. No. L-17233, September 29, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Toribio C. Tabanao, a clerk-bookkeeper in the Office of the Municipal Treasurer of Moalboal, Cebu, was charged with malversation of public funds for misappropriating P2,376.43. Upon arraignment, he pleaded guilty and fully reimbursed the amount. The trial court convicted him, appreciating the plea of guilty as a mitigating circumstance, and sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty of 3 years of *prision correccional* as minimum to 7 years of *prision mayor* as maximum. Tabanao appealed, arguing that "extreme poverty" should be considered as an additional mitigating circumstance because he allegedly used the funds to treat his son's illness, which would justify a lower penalty.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the mitigating circumstance of extreme poverty should be appreciated in favor of the accused.
2. W/N the indeterminate penalty imposed by the trial court is correct.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the mitigating circumstance of poverty cannot be considered in favor of a clerk receiving a salary. Relying on Webster's International Dictionary, the Court defined poverty as "a condition worse than that of a poor person." While the accused may have been poor, his receipt of a salary negated a condition of poverty. Furthermore, the record showed that only P50.00 of the misappropriated amount was actually used for his son's illness.

2. **YES.** Under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 1060, the penalty for malversation of the amount involved is *prision mayor* in its minimum and medium periods. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law with one mitigating circumstance (plea of guilty) and no aggravating circumstances, the proper maximum term is within the minimum period of the prescribed penalty (6 years, 1 day to 7 years, 4 months), and the minimum term is within the penalty next lower in degree (*prision correccional* in its medium and maximum periods). The trial court's sentence of 3 years minimum and 7 years maximum falls within these lawful ranges.

The judgment is AFFIRMED.
