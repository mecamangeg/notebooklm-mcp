I. CAPTION
ABELARDO JAVELLANA, et al. v. SUSANO TAYO, as Mayor of the Municipality of Buenavista, Iloilo, G.R. No. L-18919, December 29, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were duly elected councilors of the Municipality of Buenavista, Iloilo. The Municipal Council had previously set its regular sessions for the first and third Wednesdays of every month, approved by Respondent Mayor Susano Tayo. However, during the scheduled sessions on June 1, 1960, and several subsequent dates, the Mayor, Vice-Mayor, the No. 1 and No. 2 Councilors, and the Secretary were absent.

The six petitioners, constituting a majority of the council, elected a temporary presiding officer and secretary among themselves and proceeded to transact business. Respondent Mayor refused to act upon the minutes, resolutions, and payrolls for the petitioners' per diems, declaring the sessions null and void because he did not preside over them. The Provincial Fiscal and Provincial Board upheld the validity of the sessions, but the Mayor persisted in his refusal. Petitioners filed a case for mandamus. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo ruled in favor of petitioners, declaring the sessions valid and awarding moral damages to one of the councilors. Respondent appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the sessions of the Municipal Council held by a majority of the members in the absence of the Mayor and the ranking presiding officers are valid.
2. W/N the award of moral damages to the aggrieved councilor is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The sessions were valid. The Court held that under Section 2221 of the Revised Administrative Code, "the majority of the council elected shall constitute a quorum to do business." Here, six out of ten members were present.

While Section 2194(d) of the same Code states the Mayor shall preside at meetings, this applies only if he is present. Regarding Section 7 of R.A. No. 2264, which lists the Vice-Mayor or the councilor with the largest number of votes as successors during the Mayor's temporary incapacity, the Court ruled that this list is not exclusive when strict application would cause public injury. The Court disregarded the principle of *inclusio unius, est exclusio alterius* because applying it would allow officials to defeat the council's legislative power by simply boycotting sessions. The Court applied by analogy the rule for *permanent* incapacity, allowing succession by the next ranking councilors, to prevent recalcitrant officials from frustrating valid sessions for political reasons.

2. **YES.** The award of moral damages to Councilor Golez was proper under Article 27 of the New Civil Code. This provision allows for damages when a public servant refuses or neglects, without just cause, to perform his official duty, causing material or moral loss to another.

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed.
