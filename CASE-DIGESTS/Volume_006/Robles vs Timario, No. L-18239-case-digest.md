I. CAPTION
CESAR ROBLES, ELISA G. DE ROBLES, and SULPICIO ROCO v. DONATO TIMARIO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18239, October 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Robles spouses were defendants in a civil case where they were ordered to pay respondents Timario spouses the sum of P9,218.00. While the case was pending appeal, the Robles spouses sold their attached properties to co-petitioner Sulpicio Roco, with the stipulation that Roco would assume payment of the judgment. Roco alleges that the Timarios requested and accepted a strip of land (84 sq. m.) from him as part payment of the judgment credit [1].

When the judgment became final, the Timarios moved for an alias writ of execution for the full amount of P9,218.00, ignoring the alleged partial payment via the land cession [2]. The Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur granted the writ for the full amount, ruling that the alleged agreement regarding the land was foreign to the case and should be the subject of an independent action [2]. Petitioners appealed, arguing a change in the situation of the parties rendered full execution inequitable.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the value of the property ceded to the judgment creditor as part payment should be determined and deducted in the same execution proceedings.
2. W/N the assignee (Roco) has the right to intervene in the execution proceedings.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that if the land was indeed ceded as part payment, its value must be determined and deducted from the judgment in the same proceedings [3]. Determination in an independent suit is improper because the judgment debtor is entitled to have the exact balance fixed to avoid paying more than what is due. Furthermore, the reduced judgment affects the amount of property to be levied and sold, influences prospective bidders, and guides the debtor’s decision on redemption [3]. Resolving the true balance now avoids complications and multiplicity of suits [4].

2. **YES.** As the transferee of the attached properties who assumed the liability, Roco stepped into the shoes of the original debtors (Robles spouses). Since the Timarios accepted part payment from him, they are estopped from questioning his intervention in the proceedings concerning the execution of the judgment [4].

The order appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the records are **REMANDED** to the court of origin to determine the exact balance of the judgment before execution is issued [5].
