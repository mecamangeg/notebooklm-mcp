I. CAPTION
VICTORIAS MILLING CO., INC. v. THE HONORABLE AUDITOR GENERAL OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17414, November 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
From June 1955 to June 1957, petitioner Victorias Milling Co., Inc. paid wharfage fees totaling P422,664.11 to the Collectors of Customs of Cebu, Iloilo, and Manila for its sugar exports and various imports. Petitioner claimed these shipments were loaded and unloaded at private wharves without using government facilities. Relying on the ruling in *Superior Gas and Equipment Co. v. Commissioner of Customs* (which exempted imports unloaded on private wharves from wharfage fees under Rep. Act No. 1371), petitioner filed claims for refund with the respective Collectors of Customs. The Collectors denied the claims because no formal protest was filed within 30 days of payment as required by law.

Petitioner then filed a claim for refund with the Auditor General, arguing that the payments were made by mistake (*solutio indebiti*) and that the Auditor General had jurisdiction over "debts and claims of any sort" against the government. The Auditor General refused to act on the claim, ruling that the Collectors of Customs have exclusive jurisdiction over such matters under the Revised Administrative Code.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Auditor General has jurisdiction to entertain a claim for refund of wharfage fees that was not protested under the Customs Law.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Auditor General's refusal to entertain the claim. The Court held that Sections 1370 and 1371 of the Revised Administrative Code prescribe the exclusive procedure for enforcing claims against the imposition and collection of customs duties, fees, or charges—specifically requiring a formal protest. Since this remedy is exclusive, the Auditor General has no power to entertain the claim even if presented as a request for refund based on *solutio indebiti*.

Furthermore, the Court ruled there was no mistake in payment to justify the application of *solutio indebiti*. Section 3 of Rep. Act No. 1371 clearly requires wharfage fees on all *exports*, regardless of whether private wharves are used. The exemption in the *Superior Gas* case applied specifically to *imports* unloaded on private wharves. Since the bulk of petitioner's payments were for exports, they were correctly paid under the law.

Petition denied; ruling affirmed.
