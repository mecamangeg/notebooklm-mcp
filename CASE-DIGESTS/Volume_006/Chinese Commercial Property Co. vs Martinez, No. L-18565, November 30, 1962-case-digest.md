I. CAPTION
CHINESE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY COMPANY v. ESPERANZA P. MARTINEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18565, November 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Chinese Commercial Property Company filed a complaint for illegal detainer against Esperanza P. Martinez and Glicerio Joco regarding a commercial door in Naga City [1]. The Municipal Court rendered judgment ordering the defendants to vacate the premises and pay accrued and monthly rentals [2]. Defendants appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Sur [3]. Pending appeal, the CFI issued a writ of execution because defendants failed to pay the monthly rentals [4]. The Sheriff served the alias writ, commanding defendants to vacate and pay, but they refused to do so, though they received the writ [5]. Consequently, the CFI found defendants guilty of indirect contempt under Rule 64, Section 3(b) of the Rules of Court for disobedience of a lawful writ and sentenced them to one month imprisonment [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendants' refusal to vacate the premises in compliance with a writ of execution constitutes indirect contempt.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's order. The Court held that a judgment for the delivery of real property is not a special judgment enforceable under Section 9 of Rule 39 (which punishes disobedience with contempt), but one to be executed under Section 8(d) of Rule 39 [8, 9]. Under Section 8(d), it is the Sheriff's duty to dispossess the losing party and deliver the property to the winner; the losing party's willingness is irrelevant [10, 11]. Citing *Angela Goyena de Quizon v. Philippine National Bank*, the Court explained that contempt under Rule 64, Section 3(h) applies only if the losing party re-enters or disturbs possession *after* being dispossessed by the Sheriff [9, 12]. Since the Sheriff had not yet ejected the defendants, their mere refusal to vacate did not constitute contempt [11].

The order appealed from was reversed and the appellants were acquitted [13, 14].
