I. CAPTION
RUFINO GALLARDO and CATALINA VITAL DE GUEVARRA v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-16919, September 29, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In March 1958, plaintiffs Rufino Gallardo and Catalina Vital de Guevarra (widow of a former employee) filed a complaint with the Regional Office of the Department of Labor against Manila Railroad Company [1]. They claimed entitlement to accumulated unused leave amounting to P809.81 [2]. The Regional Office ordered the company to pay the claim, which was affirmed by the Labor Standards Commission [2]. The company appealed to the Court of First Instance, arguing that the Regional Office lacked authority to decide the claim, but the lower court ruled against the company [2]. The company appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, which granted the Regional Office jurisdiction over money claims, was invalid because the reorganization commission was never intended to invade the powers of the Judiciary [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Regional Office of the Department of Labor has jurisdiction to adjudicate money claims under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Regional Office does not have jurisdiction. Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is void insofar as it attempts to take away from the courts the power and authority to adjudicate claims for money [4, 5]. Citing *San Felipe Iron Mines v. Naldo*, *Stoll v. Mardo*, and related cases, the Court held that the authority to adjudicate such claims remains with the courts [4]. Since the amount involved was only P809.81, the suit properly belonged to the justice of the peace courts, and the Court of First Instance had no power to entertain an appeal from the Regional Office [5].

The decision is **REVOKED** and set aside, without prejudice to the plaintiffs' right to sue in the proper court [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred. Justice Concepcion took no part [6].
