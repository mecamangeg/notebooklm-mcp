I. CAPTION
MARTINA LAMBINO, for herself and on behalf of her children, ERLINDA and ALEJANDRA, both surnamed MERCADO v. N. BAENS DEL ROSARIO, Chairman, Workmen’s Compensation Commission and the CITY OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-18434, December 29, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Juan Mercado was employed by the City of Manila as a laborer (street cleaner/sweeper) starting in 1919 [1]. In April 1952, he fell ill and was diagnosed with advanced pulmonary tuberculosis [1]. Despite this diagnosis, he was reinstated in November 1952 and assigned to construction work at the International Fair Grounds, where he was constantly exposed to rain and the heat of the sun [1]. He died of tuberculosis on May 7, 1953 [1]. His widow, Martina Lambino, filed a claim for death compensation, which the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) denied [2, 3]. The WCC ruled that the illness was not work-connected, reasoning that working in the "open air" was healthful and that the deceased could have arranged his hours to avoid inclement weather [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the deceased’s death due to pulmonary tuberculosis is compensable under the Workmen’s Compensation Act (Act No. 3428).

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the illness was caused by the nature of the deceased's work or at least aggravated by it, making it compensable under Section 2 of Act No. 3428 [5]. The Court found the WCC's conclusion that the work was "healthful" unjustified, as it ignored the laborer's exposure to dust, dirt, and garbage [6]. Furthermore, the WCC's view that he could have avoided rain was deemed "unreasonably harsh" given the urgency of street cleaning duties [6]. The Court also ruled that the City’s reinstatement of Mercado and his assignment to construction work without shelter, despite his known advanced tuberculosis, "undoubtedly aggravated his ailment" and hastened his death [7].

The decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission was **SET ASIDE**, and the respondent was ordered to compute and award the compensation [5].
