I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MAMBULAO LUMBER COMPANY and GENERAL INSURANCE & SURETY CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-18942, November 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Mambulao Lumber Company was indebted to the Republic for P2,972.71 in deficiency sales taxes for 1948. On July 20, 1954, Mambulao (principal) and General Insurance & Surety Corporation (surety) executed a bond to pay the obligation in 12 monthly installments, with a stipulation that default would make the entire balance due. Defendants failed to pay any installments. On June 14, 1957, the Republic filed a complaint for recovery. Defendants admitted the allegations but argued that the government failed to use previously paid reforestation charges (under R.A. 115) to reforest their concession area. The Court of First Instance denied the defendants' unsworn motion for postponement, received the plaintiff's evidence, and rendered judgment in favor of the Republic. Defendants appealed, raising the defense of prescription under the Tax Code for the first time.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action to recover the tax liability secured by a bond is barred by the 5-year statute of limitations under the National Internal Revenue Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the prescriptive period under Sections 331 and 183(A) of the National Internal Revenue Code (requiring assessment within 5 years) is inapplicable. Although the original obligation arose from non-payment of taxes, the tax obligation was converted into a bond. Consequently, the government's right became based on a written contract, which is enforceable within ten (10) years from the default in payment (September 1954). The action commenced in June 1957 was well within this period (*Republic v. Xavier Gun Trading*). Furthermore, the Court noted that the plea of prescription is deemed waived if not alleged in the answer (*Boñaga v. Soler*).

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED.
