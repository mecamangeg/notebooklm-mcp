I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SERGIO OÑAS, G.R. No. L-17771, November 29, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On September 4, 1958, in Pontevedra, Negros Occidental, the deceased Simeon Gallego, who owed the accused Sergio Oñas P5.80, went to Oñas’ store. According to the evidence accepted by the Court, Simeon attacked Oñas with a cane, causing Oñas to fall. When Oñas' wife tried to intervene, she was also struck by Simeon. Oñas then retrieved a cane with a hidden bayonet from his store and stabbed Simeon to ward off the blows, resulting in Simeon's death.

The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental convicted Oñas of murder and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*. Oñas appealed, admitting he inflicted the wounds but claiming self-defense. The Supreme Court found that the physical injuries sustained by Oñas and his wife corroborated the defense's theory that the deceased was the unlawful aggressor [1-6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused is entitled to a complete acquittal based on self-defense.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that while there was unlawful aggression on the part of the deceased, the accused is not entitled to complete acquittal because the third element of self-defense — reasonable necessity of the means employed to repel the aggression — was absent.

The Court held that the accused could have warded off the blows from the deceased's cane with his own cane. Furthermore, merely drawing the bayonet would have been sufficient to discourage or prevent the deceased from continuing the attack. By stabbing the deceased with the bayonet, the accused went beyond what was necessary to defend himself against the aggression [7-9].

Additionally, the Court ruled there was no treachery because the deceased started the aggression. Consequently, the crime committed was Homicide, not Murder [10, 11].

The appealed judgment is SET ASIDE and the defendant is declared guilty of Homicide [12, 13].
