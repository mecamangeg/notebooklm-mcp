I. CAPTION
DOLORES EVANGELISTA, ET AL. v. THE MUNICIPALITY OF PAOMBONG and HON. FLORENCIO MORENO, as Secretary of Public Works and Communications, G.R. No. L-18157, September 29, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Evangelista, et al. inherited a fishpond in Paombong, Bulacan. In 1958, pursuant to Republic Act No. 2056, the Municipal Council of Paombong passed resolutions requesting an investigation into fishpond boundaries to determine if navigable waters were included. The Secretary of Public Works and Communications notified petitioners of an ocular inspection regarding the "Estero Kaylaki." Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan to stop the investigation, arguing the Secretary had no jurisdiction to review their Torrens title which declared them owners. The CFI dismissed the petition and dissolved the injunction. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court. Pending appeal, the Secretary of Public Works rendered a decision on May 15, 1961, finding that petitioners had not encroached on the Estero Kaylaki. Petitioners then moved to dismiss the case on the ground that it had become academic. Respondents opposed, arguing that only the appeal should be dismissed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the case should be dismissed due to the favorable administrative finding rendering the issue academic.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the subsequent finding by the Secretary of Public Works and Communications that petitioners did not encroach on the estero does not warrant the dismissal of the case, but only of the appeal. The Court explained that dismissing the case would annul the proceedings below, whereas dismissing the appeal results in the revival of the vacated decision of the lower court (which dismissed the petition). Since the administrative investigation concluded in favor of the petitioners, the legal questions raised in the appeal became moot, justifying the dismissal of the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
