I. CAPTION
MAGDALENA C. DE BARRETTO and JOSE G. BARRETTO v. JOSE G. VILLANUEVA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14938, December 29, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Rosario Cruzado sold her "rights, title, and interest" in a house and lot to Pura L. Villanueva for P19,000. Villanueva paid a down payment but failed to pay the balance of P17,500, prompting Cruzado to obtain a judgment for the unpaid amount. Meanwhile, Villanueva secured a clean Transfer Certificate of Title (No. 32526) in her name—after the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC), the actual owner following a prior foreclosure against Cruzado, executed a deed of absolute sale to Villanueva. Villanueva then mortgaged the property to Spouses Barretto to secure a P30,000 loan, which was duly recorded.

When Villanueva defaulted on the mortgage, the Barrettos foreclosed and sought execution. Cruzado filed a motion for recognition of her "vendor's lien" in the amount of P12,000, invoking Articles 2242, 2243, and 2249 of the Civil Code. The Court of First Instance of Manila ordered the lien annotated and ruled that the vendor's lien and the mortgage credit should be paid *pro rata* from the foreclosure proceeds. The Supreme Court initially affirmed this decision but the Barrettos filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the vendor's lien only applies in insolvency proceedings and that Cruzado was not the true vendor.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the unrecorded unpaid vendor's lien shares *pro rata* preference with a recorded mortgage in a foreclosure sale absent insolvency proceedings.
2. W/N Cruzado is the true vendor entitled to a vendor's lien on the property.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the coordination of preferred credits under Articles 2242 and 2249 requires a general liquidation proceeding, such as insolvency or settlement of a decedent's estate, where the claims of all preferred creditors can be bindingly adjudicated. In the absence of such proceedings, the conflict must be decided under the principle of the Torrens system: a purchaser (or mortgagee) in good faith and for value takes registered property free from liens not recorded in the title, except statutory liens. Since there was no insolvency, Cruzado's unrecorded claim did not acquire the character of a statutory lien co-equal to the Barrettos' recorded mortgage and must remain subordinate to it [1-3].

2. **NO.** The records showed that at the time of the sale to Villanueva, ownership rested with the RFC due to a prior foreclosure and consolidation of title. Cruzado merely assigned her rights or option to acquire the property. In law, the operative sale was from the RFC to Villanueva. Therefore, Cruzado's credit cannot legally constitute a vendor's lien on the *corpus* of the property [4-6].

**Disposition:** The previous decision is RECONSIDERED and SET ASIDE. The judgment appealed from is REVERSED, declaring appellants Barretto entitled to full satisfaction of their mortgaged credit.
