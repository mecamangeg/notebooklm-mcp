I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. THE HON. NICASIO YATCO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17924, October 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Jose Lava, et al. were convicted of rebellion complexed with other crimes by the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila in 1951 and sentenced to death and *reclusión perpetua*. Their cases were appealed to the Supreme Court and remained pending decision [1]. On December 20, 1960, Lava, et al. filed a petition for *habeas corpus* before the CFI of Rizal (Quezon City), presided by respondent Judge Nicasio Yatco [2]. They argued that under the subsequent ruling in *People v. Hernandez*, rebellion cannot be complexed with other crimes, and having been detained for over 11 years (since 1950), they had effectively served the maximum penalty for simple rebellion [3-5]. The Republic opposed, arguing the lower court lacked jurisdiction because the accused were under the custody of the Supreme Court pending their appeal [6]. Judge Yatco maintained he had jurisdiction to entertain the petition [7]. The Republic filed the present petition to enjoin the respondent judge [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to grant a writ of *habeas corpus* regarding the custody of prisoners whose conviction is pending appeal before the Supreme Court.
2. W/N *habeas corpus* is the proper remedy to correct the trial court's error in complexing rebellion with other crimes.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that when a criminal case wherein the accused was convicted is on appeal before the Supreme Court, "in contemplation of law said accused is under the custody of said court" [8]. Consequently, no other court, and certainly not one of a lower category, can make any disposition regarding the custody of the accused without interfering with the authority of the Supreme Court [8]. To allow the respondent court to assume jurisdiction would amount to allowing it to review the decision of a co-equal court, which is impermissible [9].

2. **NO.** The Court held that *habeas corpus* will not lie to correct errors of fact or law, such as the erroneous complexing of crimes, unless the error affects the court's jurisdiction or renders the judgment absolutely void [9]. Citing *Pomeroy v. Director of Prisons*, the Court reiterated that if the sentencing court had jurisdiction over the crime and the person, mere mistakes in applying the law (e.g., imposing penalties for complex crimes) do not nullify the proceedings [10, 11]. Such errors are correctible only by appeal, not by a collateral attack through *habeas corpus* [11].

Petition granted. Respondent court is permanently enjoined from proceeding with the petition [12].
