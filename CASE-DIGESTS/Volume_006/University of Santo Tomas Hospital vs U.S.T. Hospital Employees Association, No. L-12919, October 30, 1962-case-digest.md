**I. CAPTION**
UNIVERSITY OF SANTO TOMAS HOSPITAL v. U.S.T. HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION (NLU), ET AL., G.R. No. L-12919, October 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 27, 1957, a prosecutor of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) filed a complaint for unfair labor practice against petitioner University of Santo Tomas (UST) Hospital for alleged violations of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act) against the union president, Felipe L. Torrecampo [1].

UST Hospital moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the CIR lacked jurisdiction and that R.A. 875 did not apply to its employment relations because it is not an industrial establishment [2]. The CIR denied the motion, ruling that R.A. 875 applies even to non-industrial entities like charitable or educational institutions. The CIR *en banc* affirmed this ruling, prompting UST Hospital to appeal to the Supreme Court [2, 3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act) applies to the employment relations within the UST Hospital, a non-profit institution.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CIR decision. Relying on the doctrine laid down in *Boy Scouts of the Philippines v. Araos* (G.R. No. L-10091), the Court held that R.A. 875 was intended by Congress to apply only to industrial employment and employers engaged in occupations for profit and gain [3]. It does not apply to organizations maintained for social service, education, or hospital and medical services not for profit [3].

Since the petitioner is a hospital owned and operated by the University of Santo Tomas exclusively for educational purposes and not for profit, R.A. 875 does not apply to its employment relations [4]. Consequently, the complaint for unfair labor practice was dismissed [4].
