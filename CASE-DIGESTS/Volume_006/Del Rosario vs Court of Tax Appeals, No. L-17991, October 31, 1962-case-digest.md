I. CAPTION
JOSE MA. DEL ROSARIO v. THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, and THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR, REGIONAL OFFICE NO. 3, MANILA, G.R. No. L-17991, October 31, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On June 25, 1955, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) issued income tax deficiency assessments against petitioner Jose Ma. del Rosario for the years 1949 to 1953. Petitioner's counsel requested reinvestigations and protested the assessments through various letters in 1955. On January 30, 1957, the CIR wrote to petitioner's counsel stating that the request for reinvestigation was considered abandoned due to the petitioner's failure to submit a waiver of the statute of limitations, and demanded payment by February 28, 1957. Subsequently, on March 9, 1960, the CIR issued a letter declaring that the tax liabilities were collectible through summary administrative methods.

On July 19, 1960, petitioner filed a petition with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) to set aside the CIR's decision and declare the warrant of distraint and levy illegal. The CIR moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that it was filed beyond the 30-day reglementary period. The CTA granted the motion and dismissed the petition.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for review before the Court of Tax Appeals was filed within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the petition was filed out of time. Under **Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125**, appeals against assessments of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue must be brought to the Court of Tax Appeals within 30 days.

The Court held that the 30-day period had clearly lapsed. The CIR's letter of January 30, 1957, already made it plain that no further motion for reconsideration or reassessment was possible. Even if the period were reckoned from the CIR's subsequent letter of March 9, 1960—which warned that summary methods would be used to collect the liability—more than three months had elapsed before the petitioner filed the appeal on July 19, 1960. Consequently, the right to appeal had prescribed.

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed.
