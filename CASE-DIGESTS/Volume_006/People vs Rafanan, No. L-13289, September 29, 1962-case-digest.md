I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DIONISIO RAFANAN and BENJAMIN RAFANAN**, G.R. No. L-13289, September 29, 1962, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On January 11, 1955, in Lapog, Ilocos Sur, armed men entered the compound of the Santella family [1, 2]. Three men, including accused Dionisio Rafanan, tied Venancio Santella and his son Alfredo, along with another son, Juan, and marched them away [2, 3]. Juan managed to escape and witnessed the gunmen shoot and kill Venancio and Alfredo [3]. Dionisio returned to the house and took cash and valuables from Josefina Peralta [4].

The Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur convicted Dionisio and Benjamin Rafanan of robbery in band with double homicide and sentenced them to death [1]. Dionisio appealed claiming alibi and voluntary surrender, having surrendered to the military a year later as a Huk member [5]. Benjamin also appealed, arguing he was not properly identified; the sole eyewitness, Juan Santella, had executed prior affidavits naming other individuals (Concordio Leonardo and Crispin Vite) as the perpetrators and admitted he only implicated Benjamin because the Constabulary told him Benjamin was with the group encountered days after the crime [6-8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi stands against the positive identification of Dionisio Rafanan.
2. W/N the identification of Benjamin Rafanan is sufficient to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
3. W/N Dionisio Rafanan is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** (The alibi does not stand). The Court ruled that alibi cannot prevail in the face of positive identification by witnesses who had no motive to testify falsely [6]. Dionisio was unequivocally identified by Juan Santella and the victims' widows, who saw him for a considerable time during the robbery and abduction [9].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the evidence against Benjamin was insufficient. The sole eyewitness, Juan Santella, gave inconsistent sworn statements, initially claiming he did not know the other assailants and later naming different persons [7, 8]. He admitted linking Benjamin to the crime only because the Constabulary reported Benjamin was present in a separate encounter days later [8]. This testimony failed to engender moral certainty of guilt [8, 10].

3. **NO.** The Court applied the doctrine in *People v. Semañada*, stating that for voluntary surrender to be mitigating, the accused must surrender to authorities by reason of the commission of the crime for which he is prosecuted [5, 11]. Dionisio surrendered to the military to resolve his status as a Huk, not to answer for the robbery and homicide charges [11].

The judgment is **AFFIRMED** with respect to Dionisio Rafanan and **REVERSED** with respect to Benjamin Rafanan, who is hereby **ACQUITTED** [11].
