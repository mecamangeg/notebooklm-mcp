I. CAPTION
CHENG BAN YEK CO., INC. v. AUDITOR GENERAL, G.R. No. L-18354, December 29, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cheng Ban Yek Co., Inc., owner of International Oil Factory, imported cottonseed and fish oils from 1953 to 1955 for use in manufacturing vegetable lard. Initially, the Central Bank (CB) exempted these importations from the 17% special excise tax under Republic Act No. 601, accepting the view that hydrogenated cottonseed oil was a "stabilizer." The CB even refunded P113,219.25 previously paid by Petitioner [1].

However, the CB Auditor later questioned this exemption and demanded payment of P185,884.09 (covering the refund and unpaid balance), arguing the oil was not a stabilizer [2]. The matter was referred to the Auditor General, who sought opinions from the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) and the National Science Development Board (NSDB). The scientific consensus established that hydrogenated cottonseed oil constitutes 10-15% of the mixture to provide plasticity, whereas true "stabilizers" are added in minute amounts (less than 2%) to maintain chemical equilibrium [3, 4]. Based on this, the Auditor General ruled the importation was a component/ingredient, not a stabilizer, and thus taxable [5, 6]. Petitioner appealed the decision to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the imported hydrogenated cottonseed oil used in the manufacture of vegetable lard is a "stabilizer" exempt from the 17% special excise tax under Republic Act No. 601. [3]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Auditor General [7].

The Court held that the term "stabilizer" in Republic Act No. 601 is used in its technical sense, and therefore reliance must be placed on the definition provided by technical or scientific experts [8, 9]. The Chairman of the NSDB, the highest scientific institution in the Philippines, confirmed that hydrogenated cottonseed oil serves as a **component** (used in 10-15% quantities to change physical state) rather than a stabilizer (used in <2% quantities to prevent chemical changes like rancidity) [9, 10].

Furthermore, the Court applied the fundamental principle that exemption *provisos* in tax laws must be strictly construed and not unduly enlarged [11]. Since the article functioned as a component, it is subject to the special excise tax.

The petition is dismissed and the decision of the Auditor General is affirmed [7].
