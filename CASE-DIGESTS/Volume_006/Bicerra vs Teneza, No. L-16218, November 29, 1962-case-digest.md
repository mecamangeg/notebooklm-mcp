I. CAPTION
ANTONIA BICERRA, et al. v. TOMASA TENEZA and BENJAMIN BARBOSA, G.R. No. L-16218, November 29, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Bicerra, et al. were the owners of a house worth P200.00 built on their lot in Lagangilang, Abra. In January 1957, defendants Teneza and Barbosa forcibly demolished the house, claiming to be the owners thereof [1]. The materials were placed in the custody of the barrio lieutenant [1]. Plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Abra seeking to be declared the owners of the house and/or its materials, and demanding payment of P200.00 actual damages plus P600.00 moral and consequential damages [1]. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the action was within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace Court [2]. The CFI dismissed the complaint on the ground that the suit did not involve title to real property and the amount demanded did not exceed its jurisdictional limit [2, 3]. Plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for relief arising from the demolition of the house involves title to real property cognizable by the Court of First Instance.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that while a house is classified as immovable property, its character as an immovable ceases once it is demolished [4]. Therefore, an action for the recovery of damages in connection with a demolished house does not involve title to real property [4]. Such an action falls under the jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace Court or the Court of First Instance depending on the amount of the demand [4]. In this case, the total claim was P800.00, which was within the jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace Court (limited to P2,000.00 under the law at the time) [3]. Although the plaintiffs asked to be declared owners of the dismantled house or materials, such declaration is only incidental to the real cause of action to recover damages [4].

The Order of the Court of First Instance is affirmed [5].
