I. CAPTION
MARIA B. CASTRO v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-12174, December 28, 1962, J.B.L. Reyes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Maria B. Castro filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration regarding the Supreme Court's decision on her war profits tax liability. She contended that the 1% monthly interest on her tax deficiency should be limited to a maximum of 36% (corresponding to 3 years), invoking Section 51(e) of the National Internal Revenue Code as amended by Republic Act No. 2343, which was approved on June 29, 1959 [1, 2]. The original tax assessment against her had been issued on September 23, 1950 [3]. Castro argued that the imposed interest amounted to a penalty, and thus the subsequent law (R.A. 2343) imposing a lighter penalty should be given retroactive effect [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N R.A. 2343, which limits interest on deficiency taxes to 3 years, should be applied retroactively to a tax delinquency incurred in 1950.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that there is no legal ground to apply R.A. 2343 retroactively to the petitioner's delinquencies which accrued in 1950, almost nine years before the law was enacted [3]. Laws are presumed to operate only prospectively and have no retroactive effect in the absence of a clear provision to that purpose [3, 5].

Furthermore, the Court rejected the contention that the interest is a penalty. The imposition of 1% monthly interest is not penal but constitutes just compensation to the State for the delay in payment and for the taxpayer's use of funds that rightfully belong to the government [4, 6]. Since the interest is compensatory and not penal, the principle regarding the retroactive application of lighter penalties does not apply [4].

The Petition for Reconsideration is DENIED [7].
