I. CAPTION
JUAN BENSON, ET AL. v. ISABELO G. OCAMPO, G.R. No. L-18189, December 29, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Isabelo Ocampo, a landholder of a 50-hectare tract in La Union, filed a complaint in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) against his tenants, petitioners Juan Benson et al. Ocampo alleged that the tenants committed various irregularities, including cutting trees without permission, using tillable land for pasture, and failing to remit his share of vegetable and tobacco produce. Ocampo prayed for the tenants' ejectment and the liquidation of the palay deposits. In their answer, the tenants denied certain allegations and prayed for a reliquidation of their shares from the commencement of their tenancy in 1954.

The CAR ruled in favor of Ocampo, authorizing the ejectment of the tenants. It ordered the liquidation of crops only for the years 1957, 1958, and 1959, applying the 30-70 sharing ratio. The CAR limited the liquidation to three years based on the statute of limitations for demanding an accounting under Republic Act No. 1199. The tenants appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the limited period of reliquidation and the sharing ratio.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the reliquidation of shares should be limited to the three-year period preceding the complaint.
2. W/N the 30-70 sharing ratio applied by the lower court was correct.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the reliquidation should begin from 1954, when the tenancy relations started. While Section 17 of Republic Act No. 1199 limits the period within which an accounting may be demanded to three years, the Court held that because the respondent landholder himself prayed for a reliquidation in his complaint, this necessarily implied a waiver of his right to plead the statute of limitations regarding said accounting [1-3].

2. **NO.** The evidence established that the property is second-class land, as it produces less than forty (40) cavanes of palay per hectare. Pursuant to Section 33 of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended, the lawful sharing ratio for such land is 25% for the landholder and 75% for the tenant. Respondent Ocampo admitted this classification [3].

The decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations is **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION** that the reliquidation of shares shall be made beginning from the year 1954 and shall be on a 25-75 sharing basis in favor of the petitioners [4].
