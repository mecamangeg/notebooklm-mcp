I. CAPTION
MAXIMO MORALES v. MARIA BIAGTAS, JOSE CUISON, BERNABE CUISON and COSME CUISON, G.R. No. L-17193, September 29, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On July 19, 1949, Martin Cuison sold a parcel of land to petitioner Maximo Morales for P2,000.00, reserving the right to repurchase it within two years [1]. Neither Martin nor his heirs (respondents) repurchased the property within the stipulated period [1]. In 1954, Morales filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan to order the Registrar of Deeds to register his affidavit of consolidation [1]. The CFI granted this on October 14, 1959 [1]. However, on November 24, 1959, respondents filed a motion to repurchase the property, invoking Article 1606 of the New Civil Code, which allows vendors to repurchase within 30 days from the time a final judgment renders the contract a true sale with right to repurchase [2]. The CFI granted the motion, ruling that the 30-day period had not yet expired [3]. Morales appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondents can avail of the 30-day special period to repurchase under Article 1606 of the New Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court set aside the lower court's order.

First, the deed of sale with right to repurchase was executed on July 19, 1949, before the New Civil Code took effect [4]. Under Article 2255 of the New Civil Code, former laws regulate acts and contracts with a condition or period executed before the Code's effectivity [5]. Since the Old Civil Code contained no provision similar to the 30-day period in Article 1606, the period agreed upon by the parties governs [5]. The respondents lost their right to redeem when they failed to do so within the stipulated two years [5].

Second, even if the New Civil Code were applicable, Article 1606 allows redemption within 30 days from final judgment only when the "issue or controversy between the parties concerns with or involves the juridical nature or character of the contract" [5]. In this case, there was no controversy regarding whether the contract was a sale a retro or an equitable mortgage; thus, the provision does not apply [5].

The order appealed from is set aside [6].
