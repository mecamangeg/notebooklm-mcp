I. CAPTION
GERONIMO T. SUVA v. CECILIO CORPUS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18397, November 29, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On January 24, 1958, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Nueva Ecija ordered petitioner Suva to pay respondents P3,600.00 in damages [2]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, and Suva's subsequent appeal to the Supreme Court was dismissed on March 18, 1960 [2]. The judgment became final and executory, and the case was remanded for execution on September 10, 1960 [3].

On October 11, 1960, Suva filed a petition with the same CFI to enjoin the enforcement of the decision, alleging fraud, accident, mistake, excusable negligence, and newly discovered evidence [3]. He claimed the damage to respondents' property was caused by a flood, not his negligence [4]. The trial court dismissed the petition, ruling the grounds were not well-taken [5]. Suva appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for new trial or to set aside a judgment may be entertained after the judgment has become final and executory. [6, 7]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the petition, which is in the nature of a new trial, cannot be entertained because the decision sought to be set aside had long become final and executory [6, 7]. Under Section 1, Rule 37, or Section 1, Rule 55 of the Rules of Court, a new trial can only be sought either within 30 days after notice of judgment or before entry of final judgment [6, 7].

Furthermore, the Court ruled that the alleged "newly discovered evidence"—that the damages were caused by a flood—could have been proven in the original case with the exercise of proper diligence, which petitioner's counsel failed to observe [4, 8]. Thus, it does not warrant reopening the case [4, 9].

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Reyes, J.B.L., J.**, concurred in the result, noting that there was no showing of extrinsic fraud [11].
