I. CAPTION
PATRICIO MAGTIBAY v. HON. FEDERICO C. ALIKPALA, ET AL. and TEODORA O. JULIANO v. THE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-17590 & L-17627, November 29, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Teodora Juliano (landowner) and Patricio Magtibay (tenant) had a verbal share tenancy agreement. On May 5, 1960, Magtibay notified Juliano of his decision to convert their relationship to leasehold tenancy pursuant to Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199 (Agricultural Tenancy Act) [1]. Juliano refused, informing Magtibay she would challenge the law's constitutionality. She then filed a petition for declaratory relief (Civil Case No. B-252) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Laguna to declare the provision unconstitutional [2].

Subsequently, Magtibay filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) to compel the conversion [3]. He also moved to dismiss the CFI declaratory relief case, arguing that a breach had already occurred, precluding declaratory relief [4]. The CFI denied the motion to dismiss. Meanwhile, the CAR denied Juliano's motion to suspend its proceedings pending the CFI case [5, 6]. Both parties filed petitions for certiorari with the Supreme Court [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for declaratory relief is the proper remedy to challenge the constitutionality of Section 14 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act after the tenant has already exercised his right to conversion and the landlord has refused.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the CFI acted with grave abuse of discretion in denying the tenant's motion to dismiss the petition for declaratory relief. Under Section 2 of Rule 66 of the Rules of Court (now Rule 64), a statute may be construed only *before* there has been a breach thereof [7].

Magtibay had already asserted his statutory right to convert the tenancy, and Juliano's refusal constituted a breach or actionable violation [7]. Once a breach has occurred, the remedy is not declaratory judgment but an ordinary action. The landowner should have waited for the case to be brought before the CAR, where she could resist the plea by invoking the law's invalidity [8]. The CAR has the jurisdiction to pass upon the constitutional issue as an incident to the tenancy case [9, 10].

Accordingly, the petition in G.R. No. L-17590 is GRANTED (CFI orders set aside), and the petition in G.R. No. L-17627 is DENIED [11, 12].
