I. CAPTION
MINDANAO REALTY CORPORATION v. FILOMENO KINTANAR, ELADIO ENRIQUEZ, BARTOLOME FERNANDEZ, et al., G.R. No. L-17152, November 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Mindanao Realty Corporation filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Davao to quiet title regarding parcels of land seized by the government under Vesting Order P-2. The plaintiff sued the Republic of the Philippines and Filomeno Kintanar, Eladio Enriquez, and Bartolome Fernandez, "personally and in their capacities as Chairman and members of the Board of Liquidators," alleging illegal deprivation of property [1].

Kintanar, Enriquez, and Fernandez filed a motion to dismiss the complaint specifically against them in their private and personal capacities, arguing a lack of cause of action [2]. The lower court granted the motion, ruling that under the allegations of the complaint, no judgment could be rendered holding them personally liable. The plaintiff appealed this order to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendants Kintanar, Enriquez, and Fernandez can be held liable in their private and personal capacities based on the allegations in the complaint.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. The Court ruled that to determine the sufficiency of a cause of action, only the facts alleged in the complaint must be considered [3]. A review of the complaint revealed that the specific acts complained of—assuming possession and control of the properties—were committed by the defendants in their official capacities as Chairman and members of the Board of Liquidators [4].

The Court established the doctrine that public officials are not personally liable in their private capacity for acts done in the performance of their official duties unless they have acted maliciously and in bad faith outside the scope of their official authority [5]. Since the complaint contained no allegation that the officials acted with malice or bad faith, they cannot be held responsible in their individual private capacities [6].

The order of the lower court dismissing the complaint against the defendants in their personal private capacities is affirmed [7].
