I. CAPTION
INTESTATE ESTATE OF SPOUSES IGNACIA MENDOZA and GO TUANA; JOSE ARSENAL GO v. GO TUANA and IGNACIA MENDOZA, G.R. No. L-14329, November 30, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Jose Arsenal Go, administrator of the Intestate Estate of Spouses Go Tuana and Ignacia Mendoza, was ordered by the CFI of Cebu on March 3, 1956, to deposit proceeds from the sale of land (P1,500) and sugar quota (P9,000) into a PNB savings account, after deducting amounts already delivered to the heirs [1, 2]. On January 2, 1957, the heirs (appellants) filed a motion to hold the administrator in contempt for failing to make the required deposits and for making disbursements without prior court approval [3].

In his opposition, the administrator explained that he had distributed P7,000 to the heirs and paid P2,000 in estate taxes and expenses, leaving only P500 which he deposited in the bank [4, 5]. The trial court found the explanation satisfactory and denied the motion for contempt, ordering the administrator to include these items in his new report of accounts [5, 6]. The heirs appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved only questions of law [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the administrator should be held in contempt for failure to strictly comply with the court order to deposit estate funds.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the lower court's order. The administrator provided a satisfactory explanation regarding the disposition of the proceeds, showing that significant amounts were distributed to the heirs or used for taxes, and these were reflected in his reports [7]. While the administrator may not have strictly followed the order—specifically regarding the deposit of cash on hand as of December 31, 1955—the funds were duly accounted for in his statements [7, 8].

The Supreme Court held that the motion for contempt was "at best premature" [8]. Liability for any alleged irregularity should await the result of the hearing for the approval of the administrator's accounts [7]. The Court emphasized that exoneration from the contempt charge does not imply approval of the accounts; proper punitive or corrective action may still be taken after the hearing and reception of evidence regarding said accounts [9].

**Order affirmed.**
