I. CAPTION
HACIENDA ESPERANZA and HACIENDA CAMMISANA v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and NATIONAL SUGAR WORKERS’ UNION (PAFLU), G.R. No. L-18708, November 28, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
A complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP) was filed in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against petitioners Hacienda Esperanza and Hacienda Cammisana involving 120 laborers [1]. The CIR found no ULP regarding the dismissal of laborer Salvador Vicente, as his dismissal occurred two years after the alleged union activities. However, the CIR awarded separation pay to Vicente's heirs "for reasons of equity" [2-4]. The petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the CIR lacked jurisdiction because the dispute involved agricultural laborers and agricultural enterprises [5]. The appeal regarding another laborer, Lorenzo Tiayon, became moot due to a settlement, leaving only the issue of Vicente’s separation pay [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over a labor dispute involving agricultural laborers.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Supreme Court held that the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) lacked jurisdiction over the controversy. Agricultural laborers do not fall within the purview of the word "employee" defined in Section 2(d) of Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act) [7]. Instead, disputes involving the relationship between capital and labor on agricultural lands fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) created by Republic Act No. 1267 [7, 8].

The Court established that in the absence of an adequate showing that the complaining laborers of an agricultural enterprise perform "no agricultural work of any kind at all," their conflicts with their employers lie within the jurisdiction of the CAR, not the CIR [9]. Since there was no finding that the tasks of the respondent laborers were totally unconnected with agricultural operations, the CIR improperly assumed jurisdiction [8, 9].

The decision of the Court of Industrial Relations was vacated and set aside, and the case was ordered dismissed [10].
