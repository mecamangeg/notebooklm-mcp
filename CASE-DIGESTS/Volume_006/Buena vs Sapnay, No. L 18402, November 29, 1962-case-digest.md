I. CAPTION
**CANDIDO BUENA v. ELVIRA SAPNAY, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-18402, November 29, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Before World War II, plaintiff Candido Buena obtained a judgment in Civil Case No. 6024 against the original defendants. The records were destroyed during the war. In 1950, Buena applied for reconstitution (Case No. R-237). The application was granted, and the decision was reconstituted based on a simple copy. Because more than five years had elapsed without execution, Buena filed the present action to revive the reconstituted judgment [1].

However, the trial court found significant procedural defects in the reconstitution proceedings. Two defendants were already deceased when the application was filed. Of the remaining five, only defendant Manuel Bulacan was mailed a notice, but it was defective as he received it only after the hearing date. The four other defendants received no notice at all [2]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint for revival, ruling that the reconstitution court never acquired jurisdiction over the defendants due to the lack of notice required by law [3]. Buena appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the order of reconstitution and the reconstituted decision are valid and enforceable despite the lack of notice to the defendants in the reconstitution proceedings.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint. The Court held that the court in the reconstitution case never acquired jurisdiction over the defendants because they were either defectively notified or not notified at all [4]. This violation of **Section 3 of Act No. 3110**, which mandates that notice of hearing in reconstitution cases be sent to all interested parties, rendered the proceedings null and void [4].

Citing *Banco Español-Filipino v. Palanca*, the Court declared that the void order of reconstitution is a "lawless thing, which can be treated as an outlaw and slain at sight," and may be attacked either directly or collaterally [4]. Since the reconstitution was void for lack of jurisdiction, the judgment based upon it cannot be enforced.

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred [6].
