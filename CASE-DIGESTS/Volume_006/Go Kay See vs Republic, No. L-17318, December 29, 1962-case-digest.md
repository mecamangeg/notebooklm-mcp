I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER FOR NATURALIZATION AS PHILIPPINE CITIZEN. ANTONIO GO KAY SEE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17318, December 29, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On April 12, 1956, Antonio Go Kay See filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Isabela [1]. The court granted the petition on November 25, 1957, ordering the issuance of the certificate after the mandatory two-year probationary period [1]. On December 21, 1959, Go Kay See filed a motion to take his oath, claiming he had complied with the requirements of Republic Act No. 530 [2]. The Provincial Fiscal opposed the motion, alleging that the petitioner failed to pay annual registration fees and register as an alien for the years 1958 and 1959 [3]. Go Kay See admitted this failure but argued he had an "honest belief" he was exempted because his Alien Certificate of Registration had been presented as an exhibit in court [4, 5]. The lower court rejected the opposition and ordered the issuance of the naturalization certificate on June 3, 1960 [3]. The Republic appealed [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's failure to register as an alien during the two-year probationary period disqualifies him from taking the oath of citizenship.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court, ruling that the petitioner's failure to register as an alien during the intervening two-year period was a patent violation of government policy requiring aliens to register annually [4]. This failure falls clearly within the prohibition of Republic Act No. 530, which prevents a naturalization decision from becoming executory if the applicant violates government-promulgated rules during the probationary period [4].

The Court held that the two-year period is an "actual test of fitness," and failing to register demonstrates that the State has no guarantee the applicant will remain a law-abiding citizen once sworn in [5]. The Court dismissed the petitioner's claim of "honest belief" as a "flimsy excuse" that did not exempt him from compliance [4, 5].

The order of the lower court and the decision granting naturalization were **SET ASIDE** [5].
