I. CAPTION
THE DE LA RAMA STEAMSHIP COMPANY, INC. v. NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, G.R. No. L-15659, November 30, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
This case is a sequel to a 1956 decision (G.R. No. L-8784) wherein the Supreme Court ruled that the National Development Company (NDC) validly cancelled its management contract with De La Rama Steamship Co., thereby negating De La Rama's option to purchase NDC's vessels. Following this, De La Rama filed a "Supplemental Pleading" in the trial court seeking reimbursement of P1,505,603.82 for management expenses and commissions, plus P1,100,000.00 in damages. NDC opposed, arguing these were new causes of action not material to the original suit regarding the option to buy. The trial court admitted the pleading and subsequently appointed a Board of Accountants to examine the claims. The Board Chairman submitted his report on April 16, 1959. Without giving NDC notice or an opportunity to object to the report, the trial court rendered a decision on April 29, 1959. NDC appealed, citing improper admission of the supplemental pleading and violation of due process.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the supplemental pleading was properly admitted.
2. W/N the trial court violated due process by rendering judgment on the Commissioner’s Report without a hearing.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the causes of action in the "supplemental pleading" were not relevant or material to the original action to enforce the option to buy [1]. Under Section 479 of the Code of Pleading, supplemental pleadings are for new facts material to the original right; here, the claim for reimbursement was a consequence of the *failure* of the original right and should have been an alternative cause of action originally [1]. However, in the interest of the "speedy administration of justice," the Court refused to dismiss the pleading. Instead, it ordered the supplemental pleading enrolled in the lower court as a *new action*, subject to the payment of registration fees based on the amounts demanded [2].

2. **YES.** The trial court's action violated Rule 34, Sections 10 and 11, and the due process clause of the Constitution [3]. The court rendered judgment immediately after the Board Chairman submitted the report, denying NDC the opportunity to submit objections or be heard [4]. The Court ruled that NDC did not waive this right by failing to file a Motion for Reconsideration, as it promptly raised the error on appeal [5].

Decision appealed from is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED to the court *a quo* with instructions to enroll the supplemental pleading as a new action and conduct proceedings on the Commissioner's Report in accordance with the Rules [6].
