I. CAPTION
People of the Philippines v. Ildefonso Cortez, et al., G.R. No. L-13968, October 31, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of October 24, 1955, during a wedding dance in Reina Mercedes, Isabela, a commotion occurred involving the group of Alejo Uy, Sergio Pataueg, and Felix Sacang against the Pascual brothers [1]. After a fistfight, Uy, Pataueg, and Sacang rushed towards Librado Pascual. Pataueg clubbed Librado, Sacang hacked him, and appellant Uy stabbed him with a dagger [2]. Librado died shortly after, but not before giving an *ante mortem* statement identifying his attackers [3], [4].

The Court of First Instance of Isabela convicted Uy of murder qualified by treachery and sentenced him to *reclusión perpetua*. His co-accused Ildefonso Cortez was acquitted, while Pataueg and Sacang were convicted of slight physical injuries [5]. Uy appealed, attempting to shift the blame to one Domingo Paual, who confessed to the crime two years later. The Court found this confession unworthy of credence [6], [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the *ante mortem* statement of the deceased is admissible.
2. W/N the killing was qualified by treachery.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The *ante mortem* statement is admissible. The Court held that the statement was given under the consciousness of impending death, which was proven by the doctor's testimony and the serious nature of the wound that caused the victim's death shortly after the statement was taken [8].

2. **NO.** The crime is not murder qualified by treachery. The Court reasoned that the decision to kill was sudden and incidental to the ongoing conflict. While the victim's position might have been vulnerable at the moment of the attack, this situation was not deliberately sought by the appellant but was purely accidental [9]. However, the Court ruled that the crime is aggravated by **abuse of superior strength**, as the three aggressors were armed and held numerical superiority over the weaponless victim [9], [10].

**Disposition:** The judgment is **MODIFIED**. Appellant Alejo Uy is found guilty of **HOMICIDE** with the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength. He is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 8 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* as minimum to 17 years, 4 months and 1 day of *reclusion temporal* as maximum [10].
