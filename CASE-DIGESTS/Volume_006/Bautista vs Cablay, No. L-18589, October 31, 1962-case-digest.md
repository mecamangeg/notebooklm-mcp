I. CAPTION
BALDOMERO BAUTISTA, et al. v. ALEJANDRA CABLAY, et al., G.R. No. L-18589, October 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants, the children of Alberto Bautista, filed a complaint against defendants-appellees (heirs of Anastacio Tuason and subsequent buyers) to recover two parcels of riceland in Pozorubio, Pangasinan. Plaintiffs alleged that their father mortgaged the land to Tuason for P1,500, under an agreement where Tuason would harvest the products to pay the debt (antichresis), and that the debt had been fully paid [1, 2].

Defendants filed an answer raising the affirmative defense of prescription, arguing they had title and adverse possession [3]. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan held a preliminary hearing on this special defense. Evidence presented showed that Tuason acquired the land via a final deed of sale by the Provincial Sheriff and a writ of possession dated May 7, 1935 [4]. The land was subsequently sold to Daniel Frianeza in 1941, and then to Graciano Barroso in 1950 [4]. The lower court dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing that the dismissal was improper because the complaint alleged a contract of antichresis, which does not prescribe, and that the court should have relied solely on the complaint's allegations [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs' action is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the order of dismissal. A complaint may be dismissed on a plea of prescription raised in an answer if the evidence introduced at a preliminary hearing supports it [6].

The evidence established that one of the defendants (Barroso) and his predecessors-in-interest (Tuason and Frianeza) had been in possession of the land continuously, peacefully, and adversely to the whole world from May 7, 1935, until the filing of the complaint on November 5, 1958 [4]. The Court held that independently of the title transmitted by the Provincial Sheriff's deed of sale, the plaintiffs' cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations due to the defendants' long period of adverse possession [4, 7].

The order appealed from is hereby affirmed [8].
