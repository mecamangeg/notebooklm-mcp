I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PEDRO BAUTISTA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17772, October 31, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of March 4, 1960, in Barrio Balagtas, Batangas, Juanito Hernandez heard his cousin, Crisanto Ponyo, pleading for others not to approach him. Hernandez ran to the scene and saw the accused—Pedro, Felipe, Alberto, and Roman (all surnamed Bautista), and Mariano Baticos—surrounding Ponyo. Felipe struck Ponyo with an iron bar, while the others stabbed him with *balisong* knives, killing him instantaneously. The autopsy revealed nine injuries caused by three distinct types of instruments: blunt, sharp-pointed, and three-edged.

Charged with murder, the accused pleaded not guilty. During trial, Pedro Bautista claimed self-defense, alleging Ponyo attacked him first and that he only stabbed Ponyo after wresting the knife away. The other four accused raised the defense of alibi. The Court of First Instance of Batangas convicted all five accused of murder qualified by abuse of superior strength. They appealed to the Supreme Court. During the pendency of the appeal, Roman Bautista died.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Pedro Bautista acted in self-defense.
2. W/N the defense of alibi raised by the other appellants is unavailing.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court rejected the plea of self-defense for failure to prove the necessary elements: (1) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; (2) lack of sufficient provocation by the accused; and (3) reasonable means to prevent the aggression. Pedro's version—that he used the victim's own knife—was belied by the physical evidence showing wounds from three different kinds of weapons (blunt, sharp-pointed, and three-edged). Furthermore, Pedro admitted to stabbing the victim seven times even after disarming him, which is incompatible with self-defense and manifests a desire to kill.

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification by credible eyewitnesses. For alibi to prosper, the accused must show it was physically impossible for them to be at the scene of the crime. The prosecution witnesses, though related to the victim, were also related to the accused and gave spontaneous and convincing testimonies placing the appellants at the scene.

The case against Roman Bautista was dismissed due to his death. The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** with respect to the remaining appellants.
