**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. TEODORICO DACO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17210, November 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
On September 13, 1959, a complaint for assault upon an agent of a person in authority was filed in the Justice of the Peace Court (JP Court) of Busuanga, Palawan, against Isidro, Eustaquio, Teodorico, and Isaias (all surnamed Daco), and Mario Edonga. They were accused of attacking a policeman on September 12, 1959 [1].

After conducting a preliminary investigation, the JP Court rendered a "decision": it elevated the case against Isidro Daco to the Court of First Instance (CFI), but convicted the other four accused of slight physical injuries, sentencing them to 10 days of imprisonment [2]. Subsequently, the Provincial Fiscal filed an information in the CFI charging all five accused with assault upon an agent of a person in authority with physical injuries [2]. The four accused previously convicted by the JP Court moved to quash the information on the ground of double jeopardy [2]. The CFI sustained the motion and dismissed the case, prompting the People to appeal [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the dismissal of the information on the ground of double jeopardy was proper.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal was improper because the requisite element of a judgment by a competent court was missing.

A Justice of the Peace Court has no jurisdiction to entertain a case of assault against a person in authority or an agent of a person in authority, except for the purpose of conducting a preliminary investigation [3]. This is established under Article 148 of the Revised Penal Code and settled jurisprudence such as *Salabsalo v. Ang Koy* and *Villanueva v. Ortiz* [3].

Since the JP Court lacked jurisdiction to decide the case on its merits, its conviction of the accused for slight physical injuries was a nullity [4]. Consequently, the plea of double jeopardy cannot be sustained because the prior judgment was not rendered by a competent court [4].

The order of dismissal appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [5].
