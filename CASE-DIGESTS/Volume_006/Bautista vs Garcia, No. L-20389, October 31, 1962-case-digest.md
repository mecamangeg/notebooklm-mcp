I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO B. BAUTISTA v. PRIMITIVO A. GARCIA, G.R. No. L-20389, October 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On October 3, 1962, Santos Ambagan, the incumbent Mayor of Amadeo, Cavite, left the Philippines for Brazil. Petitioner Bautista, the elected Vice-Mayor, immediately assumed the powers and duties of the Mayor and notified the President. However, prior to his departure, Mayor Ambagan had designated respondent Garcia in writing as a "caretaker" to take charge of the municipal government subject to his instructions. Garcia subsequently issued a circular claiming he had assumed the position of Acting Mayor. Bautista filed an original action for *quo warranto* with the Supreme Court to declare himself legally entitled to the office during the Mayor's absence.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Vice-Mayor is entitled to assume the powers and duties of the Mayor during the latter's absence from the Philippines, notwithstanding the designation of a "caretaker."

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that under the relevant statutes (Republic Act No. 2259 and Republic Act No. 2264), the Vice-Mayor acts as Mayor in the event of the latter's "absence" or "incapacity." Citing *Paredes v. Antillon*, the Court ruled that "absence" must be reasonably construed as "effective absence," which means the officer is powerless for the time being to discharge the prerogatives of his office. This occurs when a Mayor leaves the territorial jurisdiction of the Philippines, as it is preposterous to claim an official can exercise powers while in a foreign country. The designation of a "caretaker" to act on previous instructions attempts a "government by remote control" which is not authorized by law.

The petition is **GRANTED**, and petitioner is declared legally entitled to assume the office of municipal mayor during the incumbent's absence.
