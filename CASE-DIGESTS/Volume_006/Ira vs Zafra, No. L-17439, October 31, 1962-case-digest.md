I. CAPTION
JOSE IRA and CONSUELO DE IRA v. MARINA ZAFRA and ALFREDO LEGASPI, G.R. No. L-17439, October 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Ira filed a case for forcible entry and detainer against defendants Zafra and Legaspi regarding an agricultural land. The Justice of the Peace Court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, finding it involved tenancy relations. On appeal to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan, the parties submitted a "Stipulation of Facts" where defendants were allowed to work the land for the 1956-1957 agricultural year on a 60-40 sharing basis, agreeing to vacate the premises after the March 1957 harvest. The CFI approved this agreement. When defendants refused to vacate after the harvest, the CFI issued a writ of execution and subsequently ordered their arrest for contempt. Defendants appealed, arguing that the stipulation converted the case into a tenancy matter falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR).

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CFI had jurisdiction to order the ejectment of the defendants after the parties entered into a stipulation establishing a sharing arrangement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the stipulation allowing the defendants to work and share on the land converted the detainer case into a tenancy matter. Under the law, the Court of Agrarian Relations has original and exclusive jurisdiction over all questions and controversies involving relationships where one party works the land [1]. The Court emphasized that under Section 49 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act (Act No. 1199), a tenant cannot be dispossessed except for causes enumerated by law and only after the dispossession is authorized by the Court (CAR) [2]. A promise to exchange the cultivated land for another is not a valid legal ground for ejectment [2]. Consequently, the CFI lacked jurisdiction to enforce the judgment or cite the defendants for contempt.

The proceedings held before the trial court were declared null and void, the case was dismissed, and the orders appealed from were set aside.
