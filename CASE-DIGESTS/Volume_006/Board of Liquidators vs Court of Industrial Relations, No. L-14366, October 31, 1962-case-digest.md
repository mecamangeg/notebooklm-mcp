**I. CAPTION**
BOARD OF LIQUIDATORS and NATIONAL RESETTLEMENT AND REHABILITATION ADMINISTRATION v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and EX-LASEDECO EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION, G.R. No. L-14366, October 31, 1962, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
On December 3, 1956, the Ex-Lasedeco Employees Association filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) on behalf of 18 former employees of the defunct Land Settlement and Development Co. (LASEDECO) [1]. They sought the cash value of vacation and sick leaves corresponding to the Japanese occupation period, invoking a previous CIR ruling (*Manlapit v. LASEDECO*) that granted similar benefits [1]. The action was directed against the Board of Liquidators (BOL), created to liquidate LASEDECO's assets, and the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA), which took over said assets [1, 2]. The CIR ruled in favor of the employees and denied the petitioners' motion for reconsideration [2, 3]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the CIR lacked jurisdiction because there was no employer-employee relationship between the parties [3, 4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over the money claims of former employees who do not seek reinstatement.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that for the CIR to exercise jurisdiction, the following requisites must be complied with: (1) there must exist an employer-employee relationship between the parties or the claimant must seek reinstatement; and (2) the controversy must relate to a case certified by the President involving national interest, bear on an unfair labor practice charge, or arise under the Eight-Hour Labor Law or Minimum Wage Law [5].

The Court cited *Price Stabilization Corporation v. CIR*, establishing that after the termination of the employer-employee relationship, if no reinstatement is sought, claims for benefits become mere money claims that fall under the jurisdiction of regular courts [6]. In this case, the claimants admitted they were "former employees" of the defunct LASEDECO and did not—and could not—seek reinstatement due to the corporation's abolition [7]. Furthermore, the claim did not involve the Minimum Wage Law, Eight-Hour Labor Law, or an unfair labor practice [8].

Accordingly, the decision and resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations are **SET ASIDE** [9].
