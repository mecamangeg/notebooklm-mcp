I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. VIVENCIO CATLI, G.R. No. L-11641, November 29, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On May 6, 1948, in Tiaong, Quezon, Vivencio Catli and a group of armed men went to the house of Vidal Saludo, the barrio lieutenant. Catli asked Saludo to accompany them to look for a missing companion; Saludo complied and was never seen alive by his family again. Witnesses later testified seeing Catli beat Saludo with a rice pestle and finding a freshly dug grave with Saludo's hat. Due to fear of Huk reprisals, the crime was not reported until December 1955. Upon exhumation, remains consistent with Saludo's description were found. Catli raised the defense of alibi and claimed the charge was a frame-up by the local Mayor. The Court of First Instance of Quezon convicted Catli of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Catli appealed, arguing, among others, that there was a substantial variance between the information, which alleged three perpetrators, and the proof, which showed more.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the variance between the allegations in the information regarding the number of perpetrators and the evidence presented entitles the accused to an acquittal.
2. W/N the delay of seven years in prosecuting the crime impairs the credibility of the witnesses.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that a variance between the allegations of the information and the evidence offered by the prosecution does not of itself entitle the accused to an acquittal [1, 2]. The accused was properly identified and was aware of the nature of the accusation. It is within the prosecuting officer’s discretion to determine who appears responsible for the offense. The failure to include other guilty participants in the information does not relieve the accused of penal liability (*U.S. v. Abanzado*) [3].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the silence of the witnesses was satisfactorily explained by their fear of reprisals from dissident bands (Huks) who were active in the area at the time [4]. The delay did not negate the positive identification of the appellant, which prevailed over his weak alibi [2].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** in toto [5].
