I. CAPTION
MACO STEVEDORING CORPORATION v. HON. MACAPANTON ABBAS and NENITA URSAL, G.R. No. L-20131, October 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On September 13, 1960, the Regional Office Administrator awarded Respondent Nenita Ursal P2,808.00 as compensation for the death of Sergio Ursal, which occurred during his employment with Petitioner Maco Stevedoring Corporation [1]. Petitioner filed a petition for relief from the award but subsequently withdrew it [2]. Based on this withdrawal, the Hearing Officer issued an order on November 10, 1960, stating that "this case is hereby ordered dismissed" [2], [3].

Ursal later filed a petition for a writ of execution with the Court of First Instance of Davao (presided by Respondent Judge Abbas) pursuant to Section 52 of Act No. 3428 [4]. Petitioner objected, arguing that the November 10 order had dismissed the award itself [4]. Judge Abbas granted the writ, prompting Petitioner to file this petition for certiorari [1], [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal order dated November 10, 1960 annulled the compensation award, thereby rendering the writ of execution void.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the order stating "this case is hereby ordered dismissed" referred only to the dismissal or withdrawal of the petitioner's "petition for relief from an order of award" [3]. It could not refer to the dismissal of Ursal's claim, as the award had already been entered almost two months prior to the order [3]. Since the petition for relief was dismissed, the order of award sustaining the claim for compensation remained valid and was properly enforced through the issuance of a writ of execution [5], [6].

The petition is **DISMISSED** for lack of merit [7].
