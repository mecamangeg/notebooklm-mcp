I. CAPTION
PAULINO J. GARCIA v. THE HON. EXECUTIVE SECRETARY and JUAN SALCEDO, JR., G.R. No. L-19748, September 13, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Paulino J. Garcia was appointed by the President as the first Chairman of the National Science Development Board (NSDB) for a fixed term of six years under Republic Act No. 2067 [1]. Following a change in administration, he was charged with electioneering and dishonesty. On February 18, 1962, the Executive Secretary ordered his preventive suspension, and respondent Juan Salcedo, Jr. was designated as Acting Chairman [2]. When the suspension exceeded 60 days, Garcia filed a petition for *quo warranto* and prohibition, arguing that under Section 35 of the Civil Service Act of 1959 (R.A. 2260), preventive suspension is limited to 60 days, after which reinstatement is mandatory [3]. Respondents contended that Section 35 applies only to officers whose cases are decided by the Commissioner of Civil Service and not to presidential appointees [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the preventive suspension of a presidential appointee with a fixed term may continue indefinitely or beyond the 60-day period prescribed by the Civil Service Act.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the preventive suspension of officers, even those appointed by the President with a fixed term, cannot be indefinite [5].

Section 35 of R.A. 2260, which limits preventive suspension to 60 days, was enacted to remedy the evils of indefinite suspension where an employee is deprived of livelihood without being able to find other work [6]. The provision makes no distinction between presidential appointees and subordinate employees; thus, the same rights and privileges should be accorded to both [6, 7].

Furthermore, indefinite suspension would violate the constitutional mandate that no officer shall be removed or suspended except for cause (Art. XII, Sec. 4, Constitution; Sec. 32, R.A. 2260) [8]. If suspension were indefinite, it could effectively serve as a penalty without a finding of guilt, rendering the fixed tenure and "removal only for cause" protections meaningless [9]. The Court held that even if the 60-day limit were not strictly applied to presidential appointees, the suspension must still be for a reasonable period, and continuing it beyond 60 days is unreasonable [10].

**Petition GRANTED.** Petitioner is reinstated, and respondent Salcedo is ordered to vacate the office [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Reyes, J.B.L., J. (Concurring):** Concurred on the ground that the petitioner was denied due process. The President, who would be the ultimate arbiter, had publicly prejudged Garcia’s guilt regarding electioneering before formal charges were even filed, violating the requirement of an impartial tribunal [12, 13].
