I. CAPTION
PHILEX MINERS UNION v. NATIONAL MINES & ALLIED WORKERS UNION, et al., G.R. No. L-18019, December 29, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent National Mines and Allied Workers Union (NAMAWUMIF) filed a petition for certification election at Philex Mining Corporation. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ordered the election. Petitioner Philex Miners Union filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR), signed by its counsel with a jurat ("Subscribed and sworn to"), arguing the order was contrary to law and evidence [1]. The CIR dismissed the MR, ruling it failed to comply with Sections 15, 16, and 17 of the CIR Rules requiring motions to be "verified under oath" [2]. Consequently, the CIR denied Petitioner's urgent motion to suspend the election. The election proceeded on January 20, 1961, resulting in Petitioner's defeat [2]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing substantial compliance with the verification rule and that the election should have been suspended pending the MR [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Motion for Reconsideration was validly dismissed for lack of proper verification.
2. W/N the filing of a motion for reconsideration or appeal automatically suspends a scheduled certification election.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The dismissal was erroneous based on unwarranted technicalities. The signature of counsel on a pleading constitutes a certification that they have read it and believe there is ground to support it (Sec. 5, Rule 15, Rules of Court) [4]. The counsel's acknowledgment in the form of a jurat constitutes substantial compliance with the CIR rule requiring verification [4]. Furthermore, verification is intended to vouch for the correctness of allegations of fact; since Petitioner's MR merely impugned conclusions of law and contained no new facts, verification was useless and superfluous [5].

2. **NO.** In the absence of a restraining order issued by a competent court, the filing of a motion for reconsideration or an appeal does not *ipso facto* suspend a scheduled certification election [6]. To hold otherwise would allow parties to arrest the movement of the bargaining process through frivolous and useless appeals [6]. Since the election had already taken place before the Supreme Court issued a preliminary injunction, there was no longer any act to enjoin [6].

Petition denied.
