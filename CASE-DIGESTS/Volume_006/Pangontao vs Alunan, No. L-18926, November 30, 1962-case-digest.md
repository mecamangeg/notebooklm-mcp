I. CAPTION
ANASTACIO PANGONTAO v. FLORES M. ALUNAN and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-18926, November 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In the November 10, 1959 elections for mayor of Talakag, Bukidnon, the Municipal Board of Canvassers proclaimed Anastacio Pangontao as the winner over Flores M. Alunan by a plurality of 37 votes. Alunan filed an election protest. The Court of First Instance (CFI) affirmed Pangontao's election but reduced his plurality to 4 votes. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the CFI decision and declared Alunan the winner by 1 vote. Pangontao appealed to the Supreme Court by certiorari, challenging the CA’s appreciation of several ballots. Specifically, he argued for the validity of ballots containing nicknames like "Nubia," descriptions like "Bulag," numbers on the reverse side, and names of non-candidates, while contesting the invalidation of ballots containing "Atty. Aquino" and "Carlos P. Garcia."

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N ballots containing the nickname "Nubia" or the word "Bulag" are valid.
2. W/N ballots with numbers written on the reverse side are valid.
3. W/N ballots where a candidate's name is written for two different positions are valid.
4. W/N ballots containing the names "Atty. Aquino" or "Carlos P. Garcia" are void as marked ballots.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that where "Nubia," a name or nickname, was written in the line for councilors, the vote is merely stray, but the ballot remains valid. Similarly, the word "Bulag" written after a candidate's name was ruled to be merely *descriptio personae* and does not invalidate the ballot, citing *Cruz v. Court of Appeals*.

2. **YES.** The Court agreed with the CA that numbers (e.g., "12", "23") written on the reverse side of ballots did not invalidate them. The evidence showed these were written finely with sharpened pencils, unlike the voters' writing, indicating they were likely written by election officials during counting to tally votes. Since they were not written by the voters themselves, the ballots are valid.

3. **YES.** The Court ruled that voting for a candidate for mayor and also writing their name for another position (e.g., senator or councilor) does not invalidate the ballot. The misplaced vote is considered merely as a stray vote.

4. **NO.** The Court affirmed that ballots containing "Atty. Aquino" were correctly rejected as marked. Atty. Aquino was the nephew and legal counsel of the petitioner; thus, writing his name was a clear scheme to identify the ballots and the voters. Regarding the ballot with "Carlos P. Garcia" (the incumbent President) written as councilor, the Court ruled it invalid. While voting for a senatorial candidate (Pajo) as councilor could be stray, voting for a prominent politician like the President who was not running for any office constitutes an identification mark, consistent with *Cruz v. Court of Appeals*.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
