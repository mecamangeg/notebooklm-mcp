I. CAPTION
URSULA FRANCISCO v. JULIAN RODRIGUEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15605, October 31, 1962, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Ursula Francisco, an illiterate woman, filed a sales application for a lot in Davao which was later rejected. In 1940, she conveyed 29 hectares of the land to her lawyer, Julian Rodriguez, for P2,000.00. She later sued to annul the deed. In a previous appeal (G.R. No. L-8263), the Supreme Court declared the conveyance null and void for lack of approval by the Secretary of Agriculture as required by Section 29 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 (Public Land Act), resulting in the reversion of the property to the State.

Following this, the Secretary of Agriculture denied the claims of both parties and ordered the land sold at public bidding. Rodriguez then filed motions with the trial court seeking possession of the property and the division of proceeds held by the receiver. The trial court denied the motions and ordered the receiver to turn over the property to the Bureau of Lands. Rodriguez appealed, arguing that the land could not be turned over to the government without a separate action for reversion instituted by the Solicitor General under Section 101 of C.A. No. 141, and that the Director of Lands was not a proper party to receive the property.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the land reverts to the State automatically without a separate action for reversion instituted by the Solicitor General.
2. W/N the Director of Lands may take possession of the property despite procedural defects in the motion for intervention.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the reversion of public land to the State under Section 29 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 is self-operative, and no separate action needs to be instituted by the Government [1]. Section 29 expressly states that any sale or encumbrance made without the Secretary's approval is null and void and produces the effect of "annulling the acquisition and reverting the property and all rights thereto to the State" [2]. The Court distinguished this from Section 101, which requires an action by the Solicitor General only when title has already vested in an individual, such as through the issuance of a patent or certificate of title [1]. Since no title had vested, the parties had no right to possession or proceeds, which were forfeited to the Government under Section 98 of the Public Land Law [3].

2. **YES.** Although the Director of Lands' motion for intervention was not strictly in accordance with Rule 13 of the Rules of Court, the Court ruled that technicalities should be disregarded when they hinder justice [4]. The filing did not unduly delay the case or impair the rights of the parties, who had no valid claim to the land. The intervention was necessary to preserve the property and carry the judgment into effect, as the land had already reverted to the State [3, 4].

The order of the trial court is affirmed [5].
