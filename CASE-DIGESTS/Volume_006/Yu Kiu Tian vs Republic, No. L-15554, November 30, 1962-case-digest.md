I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF YU KIU TIAN alias JACINTO CHUA TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, YU KIU TIAN alias JACINTO CHUA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-15554, November 30, 1962, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Yu Kiu Tian, a Chinese citizen residing in the Philippines since 1938, filed a petition for naturalization. To support his application, he presented two character witnesses, Teotimo Geologo and Agustina L. Carbonell. Although their amended affidavit stated they personally knew the petitioner since 1947, both witnesses admitted at trial that between 1947 and 1952/1953, they only knew him casually as a waiter in a restaurant they frequented. Geologo only became intimate friends with the petitioner in 1953, and Carbonell only became familiar with him in 1952. The Court of First Instance of Rizal denied the petition on the ground that the witnesses had not known the petitioner sufficiently during the ten years preceding the filing of the petition. Petitioner appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the character witnesses satisfied the requirement of having personal knowledge of the petitioner for the requisite ten-year period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that the period during which the witnesses merely recognized the petitioner as a waiter cannot be counted as part of the requisite ten-year period under Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law. Such casual recognition is not equivalent to "acquaintance," much less "personal knowledge," which is necessary to make a witness competent to testify on the applicant's moral character. A vouching witness serves as an "insurer of the character of petitioner" and must have had the opportunity to observe the applicant personally, if not intimately, to be considered competent and reliable (*Lim Ching Tian v. Republic*; *Cuaki Tan Si v. Republic*). Consequently, the petition was properly denied. The judgment appealed from is affirmed.
