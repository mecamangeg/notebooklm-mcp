I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BONIFACIO GALLORA**, G.R. No. L-21740, October 30, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Bonifacio Gallora was charged with the murder of Constantino Elliadora, who was killed in his home on the evening of March 13, 1959. The victim sustained six wounds, causing instantaneous death [1, 2]. The prosecution's case relied on the identification by the victim's widow, Felisa Elliadora, and her cousin, Andres Argonitas [2]. However, during the initial investigation by the Chief of Police the morning after the crime, both witnesses failed to identify Gallora, stating that the killer's face was covered with a handkerchief [3, 4]. They only identified Gallora as the perpetrator in sworn statements executed a week later, on March 21, 1959 [5].

Gallora denied the charge and presented an alibi, corroborated by a former municipal policeman, Felix Pacunla. He claimed he was at Pacunla's house roasting chickens from 8:00 PM until past midnight on the night of the incident [6]. Gallora even assisted in writing the incident report and voluntarily accompanied the police and health officer to the crime scene the following morning [3, 7]. Additionally, evidence surfaced that another suspect, identified as Angel or Luis Ajero, was found with a handkerchief which the widow admitted was the mask used by the killer, yet this suspect was released without charges [8, 9].

The Court of First Instance of Lanao del Norte found Gallora guilty of murder and sentenced him to *reclusión perpetua* [1]. Gallora appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the judgment and acquitted Gallora on the ground of reasonable doubt [10].

The Court held that the identification of the accused was a "slender thread" insufficient to support a conviction [5]. First, the prosecution witnesses failed to offer a reasonable explanation for not identifying Gallora immediately after the incident when investigated by the Chief of Police [5]. Second, the alleged motive of robbery was shaky as nothing was taken, and the claim that Gallora knew the widow had money was tenuous [5, 11]. Third, the conduct of the witnesses was strange, such as the cousin claiming to chop wood in the middle of the night using a scythe [5].

Furthermore, the Court found it significant that another person was found in possession of the handkerchief identified by the widow as the killer's mask, a "damning piece of evidence" that the trial court cavalierly dismissed [12]. Finally, Gallora's alibi was corroborated, and his conduct—voluntarily accompanying authorities to the scene—was inconsistent with guilt [13].

The judgment appealed from is reversed and the defendant Bonifacio Gallora is acquitted of the charge and ordered forthwith released from detention [10].
