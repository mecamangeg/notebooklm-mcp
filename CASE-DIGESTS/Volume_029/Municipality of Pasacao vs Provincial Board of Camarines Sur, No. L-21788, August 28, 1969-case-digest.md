I. CAPTION
THE MUNICIPALITY OF PASACAO v. THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF CAMARINES SUR and THE MUNICIPALITY OF LIBMANAN, G.R. No. L-21788, August 28, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Municipalities Pasacao and Libmanan in Camarines Sur had a boundary dispute over marine waters in Ragay Gulf [1]. They referred the matter to the Provincial Board, which appointed a commissioner to investigate [1]. On February 18, 1954, the Board approved Resolution No. 57 awarding the disputed area to Libmanan [1]. Libmanan subsequently filed a civil action in 1954 to recover possession of the waters [2].

In 1961, while the civil case was pending, Pasacao filed a petition for certiorari to annul Resolution No. 57 [2]. Pasacao alleged grave abuse of discretion because: (1) it was not informed of the commissioner's report prior to the resolution; (2) the resolution lacked the Provincial Governor's concurrence as he was absent; and (3) the Board disregarded the commissioner's recommendation, which supposedly favored Pasacao [2]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the petition, prompting this appeal [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the resolution is void because Pasacao was not notified of the commissioner's report.
2. W/N the resolution is void because it was approved in the absence of the Provincial Governor.
3. W/N the Provincial Board committed grave abuse of discretion by not following the commissioner's recommendation.
4. W/N the petition for certiorari was the proper remedy.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The failure to notify Pasacao of the report was a mere irregularity, not grave abuse of discretion [4]. Under Section 2167 of the Revised Administrative Code, disputes are decided by the Provincial Board [5]. Pasacao's proper remedy was to ask for reconsideration or appeal the decision to the Office of the President (Executive Secretary) [4].

2. **NO.** The resolution is valid even if approved in the absence of the Governor, who was on official business [6]. A Board member validly presided in his place, and the Governor's failure to question this authority constituted a ratification of the action taken [6].

3. **NO.** The Provincial Board is not bound to follow the recommendation of the commissioner it appointed to investigate [7]. The power to decide rests solely with the Board, subject only to appeal to the Office of the President [7].

4. **NO.** Certiorari is not a substitute for appeal or for a defense available in the ordinary course of law [4]. Pasacao should have appealed to the Executive Secretary or raised the alleged nullity as a defense in the civil recovery case filed by Libmanan in 1954 [4]. Furthermore, Pasacao is barred by laches for filing the petition six years after becoming aware of the resolution [4].

The order of the lower court is AFFIRMED [7].
