**I. CAPTION**
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CORNELIO MANUEL**, G.R. Nos. L-23786 & L-23787, August 29, 1969, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
On September 6, 1956, Dominador Irorita died in Vintar, Ilocos Norte. His wife, Indelecia, and mother-in-law initially claimed he died of tuberculosis [1]. However, rumors prompted an investigation revealing he died of gunshot wounds. Indelecia admitted to an illicit relationship with the accused, Cornelio Manuel, and pointed to him as the killer [1], [2]. Manuel executed an extrajudicial confession admitting he entered the victim's house and shot Dominador with an unlicensed .45 caliber sub-machinegun while the latter was sleeping [2], [3].

The Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte convicted Manuel of Murder and Illegal Possession of Firearm [4]. Manuel appealed, retracting his confession on the ground that it was procured through maltreatment by PC soldiers, and interposed the defense of alibi [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the extrajudicial confession of the accused is admissible.
2. W/N the defense of alibi is valid.
3. W/N the accused is guilty of Murder and Illegal Possession of Firearm.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The claim of maltreatment was rejected because the medical certificate showed only minor abrasions, contradicting the accused's claim of being repeatedly pummeled with steel gun butts and submerged in water [5], [6]. Furthermore, when brought before the Justice of the Peace to ratify his statement, Manuel voluntarily reaffirmed its truth after being closely examined by the judge [7]. This reaffirmation constituted a "second confession" whose voluntary character was beyond dispute [7].

2. **NO.** The notebook presented to prove Manuel's presence elsewhere was not authenticated, and he failed to present corroborating witnesses [8]. Additionally, the distance between the alleged location (Alilog) and the crime scene (Barrio Ester) was only 2 kilometers, failing to satisfy the requirement of physical impossibility to be at the scene of the crime [8], [9].

3. **YES.** The killing was qualified by treachery as the victim was shot while asleep without risk to the accused [10]. Dwelling was appreciated as an aggravating circumstance because Manuel surreptitiously entered the victim's house, though this was offset by the mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction [10], [11]. regarding the firearm charge, since Manuel used an unlicensed weapon to kill the victim, the penalty for illegal possession was correctly imposed in its maximum period [11].

**Judgment AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION increasing the death indemnity to P12,000.00.**
