**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION AS CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. OH HEK HOW v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-27429, August 27, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
On January 16, 1964, the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Norte granted Oh Hek How’s petition for naturalization. On January 17, 1966, petitioner filed a motion alleging compliance with Republic Act No. 530 and prayed to take his oath of allegiance. On February 9, 1966, the lower court authorized the oath, which petitioner took on the same day, resulting in the issuance of his certificate of naturalization [1]. However, the Government had timely filed an appeal. The oath was taken after the notice of appeal was filed and the record on appeal was approved [2].

Regarding his qualifications, petitioner’s income tax return for 1962 showed a net income of P6,485.50 (approximately P540 a month), and he had a wife and three children [3]. Furthermore, petitioner admitted he had not secured permission from the Minister of the Interior of Nationalist China to renounce his Chinese citizenship [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the oath of allegiance and certificate of naturalization are valid despite being issued after the Government’s appeal.
2. W/N the petitioner’s income is considered lucrative.
3. W/N the petitioner validly renounced his Chinese citizenship without the permission of the Minister of the Interior of Nationalist China.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The oath of allegiance and certificate of naturalization are null and void. The oath was taken after the trial court had already lost jurisdiction over the case due to the timely appeal by the Government, specifically after the filing of the notice of appeal and the approval of the record on appeal [2].

2. **NO.** An income of P6,485.50 per annum or about P540 a month is not considered lucrative for an applicant with a wife and three children, one of whom is of school age [3]. The Court cited jurisprudence where higher incomes (e.g., P6,000-P6,300 a year for smaller families) were deemed insufficient [3].

3. **NO.** Section 12 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 requires an applicant to validly renounce their former status. Pursuant to Articles 15 and 16 of the Civil Code, the question of how a Chinese citizen may divest himself of that status is governed by the laws of China, not the Philippines [5]. Since Chinese law requires permission from the Minister of the Interior for renunciation of nationality, and petitioner failed to secure this, he did not validly renounce his citizenship. The Court reiterated the ruling in *Go A. Leng v. Republic*, superseding contrary views in earlier cases [6].

The order appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the oath of allegiance and certificate of naturalization are declared **NULL AND VOID** [6].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Castro, Fernando, and Teehankee concurred in the result. Justices Dizon, Makalintal, Sanchez, and Capistrano concurred. Justice Barredo did not take part [7].
