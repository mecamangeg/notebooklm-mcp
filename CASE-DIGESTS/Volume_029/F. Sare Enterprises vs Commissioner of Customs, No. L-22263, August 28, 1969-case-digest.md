I. CAPTION
F. SARE ENTERPRISES v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-22263, August 28, 1969, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
In December 1954, petitioner F. Sare Enterprises imported various foodstuffs (dried fish, ham, fruits, etc.) from Hong Kong. The shipment was seized by customs authorities for failure to present Central Bank release certificates required by Central Bank (CB) Circulars 44 and 45. The goods were released to petitioner only after posting three bonds totaling over P33,000. On April 1, 1955, the Collector of Customs rendered a decision ordering the petitioner and its surety to pay the full amount of the bonds. This decision was affirmed by the Commissioner of Customs and subsequently by the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the circulars did not expressly provide for forfeiture and that CB Circular 133 had repealed Circulars 44 and 45, thereby validating the importation.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the goods imported in violation of CB Circulars 44 and 45 are subject to forfeiture under Section 1363(f) of the Administrative Code.
2. W/N Central Bank Circular 133 repealed Circulars 44 and 45, thereby abating the forfeiture.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that while CB Circulars 44 and 45 do not expressly provide for forfeiture, the forfeiture is justified under Section 1363(f) of the Administrative Code (now Tariff and Customs Code). This provision authorizes the forfeiture of merchandise imported "contrary to law." The Court, citing *Capulong v. Aseron*, explained that regulations issued pursuant to customs laws form part thereof; thus, a violation of these circulars constitutes an importation "contrary to law" within the purview of the Administrative Code [1-3].

2. **NO.** CB Circular 133 did not repeal Circulars 44 and 45 but rather reenacted them by incorporating existing regulations not inconsistent with it. Both sets of circulars share the common purpose of requiring a release certificate. Furthermore, even assuming an implied repeal occurred, the Court ruled that forfeiture proceedings are civil in nature, not criminal. Therefore, any repeal cannot be given retroactive effect to abate the forfeiture case. The Commissioner of Customs retained jurisdiction to decide the case despite the expiration or change in the governing law [4-6].

**ACCORDINGLY, the decision appealed from is affirmed, at petitioner's costs.**
