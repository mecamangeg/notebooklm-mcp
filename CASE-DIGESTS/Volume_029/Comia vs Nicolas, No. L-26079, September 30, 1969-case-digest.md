I. CAPTION
PORFIRIO COMIA and CHIEF OF POLICE ANTONIO S. GABA, SR. v. HON. JUDGE NICANOR P. NICOLAS, THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF and/or HIS DEPUTIES, and ESTANISLAO GARACHICO, G.R. No. L-26079, September 30, 1969, 29 SCRA 492, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In 1960, Estanislao Garachico and other former policemen filed a petition for mandamus and *quo warranto* (Civil Case No. R-979) against Mayor Porfirio Comia and the Chief of Police in the CFI of Oriental Mindoro. Judge Juan de Borja, temporarily assigned to the court, heard the case. Before his assignment expired, he penned a decision dated February 13, 1962, and transmitted it to the Clerk of Court, who received it on February 17, 1962. Copies were served on the parties' counsel in March 1962. No appeal or motion for reconsideration was filed within the 30-day period.

However, the records became confused, and the parties subsequently submitted the case for decision to the new presiding judge, Respondent Judge Nicanor Nicolas. Unaware of the prior judgment, Judge Nicolas rendered a new decision on September 8, 1964 (amended September 9, 1964). Petitioners Comia et al. later moved to set aside the 1964 decision, presenting proof of the 1962 De Borja decision. Judge Nicolas denied the motion, ruling that the De Borja decision was not validly filed and that petitioners were guilty of laches. Petitioners filed this action for certiorari and prohibition to annul the 1964 decision.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the 1964 decision rendered by Judge Nicolas is void due to the prior 1962 decision by Judge de Borja.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the decision rendered by Judge Nicolas in 1964 is null and void.

Under Section 9, Rule 135 of the Revised Rules of Court, if a judge signs a decision outside the province after the expiration of his temporary assignment, it is considered validly rendered upon its filing with the Clerk of Court. The Court found that Judge de Borja's decision was received by the Clerk of Court on February 17, 1962, constituting valid rendition [1]. Since the parties were served copies in March 1962 and failed to appeal or file a motion for reconsideration within the 30-day reglementary period, the 1962 decision became final and executory [2].

Once a judgment becomes final, the case is removed from the power and jurisdiction of the court to decide anew [2]. Consequently, the subsequent decision by Judge Nicolas was issued without jurisdiction. The Court emphasized that a void judgment is in effect no judgment; it neither binds nor bars anyone [2].

The petition is granted, and the decision dated September 8, 1964, as amended, and other related orders are declared null and void [3].
