I. CAPTION
REMIGIO R. ESQUILLO v. HON. ABELARDO SUBIDO, et al., G.R. No. L-30341, August 22, 1969, 29 SCRA 31, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On September 2, 1963, Mayor Orias appointed petitioner Remigio R. Esquillo as Chief of Police of Tayabas, Quezon. Although intended to be permanent, the appointment was approved by the Civil Service Commission as "provisional or temporary" under Section 24(c) of Republic Act No. 2260 because Esquillo lacked the required civil service eligibility [1]. Following the 1963 elections, the new Mayor, respondent Carmelo Nadera, terminated Esquillo's services effective October 15, 1964 [2]. Esquillo subsequently obtained eligibility on December 23, 1964 [2]. He filed a petition for Mandamus to compel reinstatement, arguing his removal violated his constitutional right to due process and security of tenure [3]. The Court of First Instance of Quezon dismissed the petition, ruling that his temporary appointment was terminable at the discretion of the appointing power [4]. Esquillo appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the termination of the petitioner's temporary appointment violated his right to security of tenure and due process.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. The Court held that when an appointment is temporary in nature, such as when the appointee lacks civil service eligibility, it can be terminated at the discretion of the appointing power [4]. Citing *Santos v. Chico* and *Barañgan v. Hernando*, the Court reiterated that temporary appointees enjoy no fixed or protected tenure and their services may be terminated at any time [5]. While the due process guaranty protects the security of tenure for permanent appointments, it does not apply to temporary appointments; sympathy for the official's plight cannot substitute for a clear legal right [6].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED**.
