I. CAPTION
BALDOMERO S. LUQUE v. JUDGE UNION C. KAYANAN, G.R. No. L-26826, August 29, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Baldomero S. Luque, a lawyer and party-defendant in Civil Case 4871, sought to prohibit respondent Judge Union C. Kayanan of the Court of First Instance of Quezon (Branch IV) from hearing said case. The case was originally assigned to Branch I. However, on November 5, 1965, Judge Kayanan took cognizance of the case, claiming it was not on Branch I's calendar, despite Branch I being in session.

Animosity developed between the two. On April 11, 1966, Luque moved to disqualify the judge, alleging in his pleading that the judge "doctored the records," "fabricated" orders, and caused "distortion of truth." Judge Kayanan cited Luque for direct contempt for the use of such language, fined him, and at one point verbally ordered his detention. Judge Kayanan denied the motion to disqualify. When Luque filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court and informed the judge via telegram that the petition was given due course, Judge Kayanan disbelieved the telegram, termed Luque's actions "sheer deviltry," and proceeded with the trial.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N respondent Judge Kayanan committed grave abuse of discretion by taking cognizance of a case assigned to another branch.
2. W/N respondent Judge Kayanan should be disqualified from hearing the case due to bias and prejudice.
3. W/N petitioner Luque’s use of words like "doctored" and "fabrication" in his pleadings was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A judge who takes cognizance of and tries a case previously assigned to another branch of the court without reasonable explanation commits a grave abuse of discretion. The Court found that Civil Case 4871 properly belonged to Branch I and was taken by respondent without justifiable reason, creating an appearance of impropriety and confusion in the administration of justice [1, 2]. Consequently, the proceedings taken by respondent judge were declared null and void [3].

2. **YES.** While a judge is not automatically disqualified by the filing of an administrative charge or hostility per se, he should inhibit himself when his official conduct is not free from the appearance of impropriety. The Court distinguished this from *Pimentel v. Salanga*, noting that here, the judge's prejudice had "concretely manifested itself" through the contempt orders, the "sheer deviltry" remark, and the refusal to respect the Supreme Court's initial action. All suitors are entitled to the "cold neutrality of an independent, wholly-free, disinterested and impartial tribunal" [4-6].

3. **NO.** Petitioner was admonished for his conduct. Canon 1 of the Canons of Professional Ethics enjoins a lawyer to maintain a respectful attitude towards the courts. The use of crude language such as "doctored," "fabrications," or "distortion of truth" demonstrates a lack of discipline and self-restraint. While a lawyer may be under a trying ordeal, he must not give vent to his feelings by employing undignified language in pleadings [7-9].

The writs of certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus were **GRANTED**. Respondent judge was directed to return the case to Branch I and refrain from taking cognizance thereof [3].
