I. CAPTION
NATIONAL MARKETING CORPORATION, CORNELIO BALMACEDA, JOSE CALDERON, ANTONIO ARAMBULO, PEDRO BALINGIT, CIPRIANO MALONZO and ROSENDO TOMAS v. HON. FRANCISCO ARCA, Presiding Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch I and JUAN T. ARIVE, G.R. No. L-25743, September 30, 1969, Capistrano, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Juan T. Arive, the Manager of the Traffic-Storage Department of the National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO), was charged and found guilty by a committee of violating a management memorandum regarding the stoppage of merchandise deliveries and improper release of shipments. [3] Consequently, the NAMARCO Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 584-60 dismissing him from service. [3] Arive appealed to the President of the Philippines. [4] The Executive Secretary, acting for the President, rendered a decision setting aside the Board's resolution and ordering Arive's reinstatement, noting that the memorandum Arive allegedly violated was declared illegal by the Supreme Court in a separate case and that Arive lacked control over the warehouses involved. [4] NAMARCO refused to comply, arguing that under its Charter (Republic Act No. 1345), the President had no jurisdiction to review the Board's disciplinary decisions. [5] Arive filed a complaint for reinstatement and damages with the Court of First Instance of Manila. [6] Respondent Judge Arca issued a preliminary mandatory injunction ordering NAMARCO to reinstate Arive. [7] NAMARCO filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court to enjoin the implementation of Judge Arca's order. [2]

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the President of the Philippines has the authority to review and reverse the decision of the NAMARCO Board of Directors dismissing a subordinate employee. [8]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The President has the authority to review and reverse the decision of the NAMARCO Board pursuant to the constitutional power of control over all executive departments, bureaus, and offices. [9] The Court held that government-owned or controlled corporations like NAMARCO partake of the nature of government bureaus or offices, which are administratively supervised by the Administrator of the Office of Economic Coordination, who is responsible to the President. [9]

The Court rejected NAMARCO's argument that the silence of Section 13(d) of Republic Act No. 1345 regarding appeals negates the President's jurisdiction. [10] Citing *Lacson-Magallanes Co., Inc. vs. Paño* and *Planas vs. Gil*, the Court reiterated that "control" means the power of an officer to alter, modify, or set aside what a subordinate has done and substitute their judgment. [10] Therefore, the President's decision to reinstate Arive was valid and binding, and the respondent Judge did not abuse his discretion in issuing the mandatory injunction. [11]

Petition dismissed, writs of preliminary injunction and preliminary mandatory injunction dissolved. [12]
