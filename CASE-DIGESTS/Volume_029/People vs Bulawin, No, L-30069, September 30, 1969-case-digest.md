**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ANASTACIO BULAWIN, G.R. No. L-30069, September 30, 1969, 29 SCRA 710, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
On September 23, 1963, at around 12:30 A.M., Ciriaco Jimenez was shot and killed while walking towards a political meeting in Barrio Mabatao, Salvador, Lanao del Norte [1, 2]. The prosecution relied heavily on Candido Autor, the alleged sole eyewitness, who claimed to have seen Anastacio Bulawin shoot the victim [3]. Other witnesses, Sgt. Laurie and Aniceto Dacalos, testified regarding the victim's identification of the accused shortly after the shooting [4, 5]. Bulawin raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was at a "hantak" game and drinking with friends five kilometers away at the time of the incident [6].

The Court of First Instance of Lanao del Norte convicted Bulawin of murder [7]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the finding of murder qualified by treachery, which warranted *reclusion perpetua*, and certified the case to the Supreme Court [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court reversed the judgment and acquitted the accused on the ground of reasonable doubt [8].

The prosecution's evidence was insufficient and contradictory. First, the testimony of the alleged sole eyewitness, Candido Autor, was deemed improbable because he failed to report the crime to the authorities or his family immediately, and his name was not included in the initial criminal complaint filed 10 days after the incident [9, 10]. Second, the testimony of Sgt. Laurie claiming the victim identified Bulawin was contradicted by his own affidavit, wherein he stated the victim gave no answer [11]. Third, the accused’s flight five days after the incident was ruled as an act of self-preservation due to threats from the victim's family, rather than an indication of guilt [12]. Finally, while alibi is generally a weak defense, it assumes importance when the prosecution's evidence is weak and fails to establish the accused's guilt with moral certainty [13, 14].

**Disposition:** Judgment reversed. Defendant-appellant Anastacio Bulawin is acquitted [8].
