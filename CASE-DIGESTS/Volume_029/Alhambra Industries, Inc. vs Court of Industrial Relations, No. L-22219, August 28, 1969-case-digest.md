I. CAPTION
ALHAMBRA INDUSTRIES, INC., petitioner, vs. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and KAPISANAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA SA ALHAMBRA (PAFLU), respondents., G.R. No. L-22219, August 28, 1969, 29 SCRA 138, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
On April 3, 1962, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found petitioner's predecessor, Alhambra Cigar and Cigarette Factory Co., guilty of unfair labor practice and ordered the reinstatement of employees Averilla, Pangan, Roy, Bernardino, and Lapasaran with back wages [1]. This order was affirmed by the Supreme Court and became final [1]. Since the predecessor's corporate life expired, the CIR issued an order on May 30, 1963, holding petitioner Alhambra Industries, Inc., as the successor, liable for the reinstatement and back wages [2]. Petitioner appealed this order, but the Supreme Court dismissed the petition, rendering the May 30, 1963 order final and executory [2].

When the respondent Union filed a motion for execution on October 4, 1963, petitioner opposed it and filed a "Manifestation and Motion" seeking a hearing to present evidence that it could not reinstate four of the employees [3, 4]. Petitioner claimed their positions had been abolished due to innovations made in January 1962 [4]. The CIR denied petitioner's motion and ordered immediate execution, ruling that the grounds raised were already existing and available during the trial and could not be raised to reopen a closed issue [5, 6]. Petitioner appealed the denial to the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR may validly refuse to reopen the case to receive evidence on the alleged impossibility of reinstatement after the judgment has become final.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's refusal to reopen the case. The Court held that the findings of fact by the CIR—specifically that the grounds raised by petitioner (abolition of positions) were already in existence and available during the trial on the merits—are binding on the Supreme Court when supported by substantial evidence [8].

Citing *Rattan Art vs. Rattan Art Employees Union*, the Court ruled that a proceeding may be reopened only upon grounds coming into existence *after* the order was rendered, not upon grounds that were available to the parties in the former proceedings and not availed of [6, 8]. Furthermore, the "law of the case" applies not only to the decision itself but to its implementation [9]. To allow the petitioner to introduce evidence now would render the rights of labor futile and frustrate the policies of the Industrial Peace Act [10].

The petition for certiorari is denied, and the appealed order is affirmed [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Justices Concepcion, Dizon, Makalintal, Sanchez, Castro, Fernando, Teehankee, and Barredo concurred; Justices Reyes and Zaldivar were on leave) [11].
