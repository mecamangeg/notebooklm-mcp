I. CAPTION
VIRGILIO M. LAYNO v. I & I EQUIPMENT & SERVICE COMPANY, JUDGE JESUS DE VEYRA, and SHERIFF OF THE CITY OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-23849, September 30, 1969, 29 SCRA 593, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On November 29, 1960, petitioner Virgilio M. Layno and respondent I & I Equipment & Service Company entered into a compromise agreement in Civil Case No. 44649, which was approved by the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, Branch XIV. When respondent sought execution for an unpaid balance, Layno filed a petition for relief from judgment, alleging fraud and deceit by respondent regarding the total obligation. Branch XIV denied the petition, ruling the fraud was intrinsic and the petition was time-barred. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed this denial in a certiorari proceeding, holding that the alleged fraud was intrinsic as Layno was not deprived of his day in court.

Subsequently, Layno filed a new complaint (Civil Case No. 52213) in the CFI of Manila (assigned to Branch XI) to annul the judgment in the previous case, again alleging fraud. Branch XI dismissed the complaint on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction to interfere with a coordinate branch and bar by prior judgment. Layno appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action to annul the judgment is barred by prior judgment.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the appellant's cause of action is barred by prior judgment. The fraud alleged in the new complaint—that the respondent concealed records of payments—is the exact same fraud relied upon in Layno's previous petition for relief from judgment [1]. This issue was already decided with finality by the Court of Appeals, which ruled that the alleged fraud was intrinsic, not extrinsic, noting that Layno, a lawyer, could have disputed the amount before signing the compromise [2]. Since the nature of the fraud was already settled in the previous proceeding, it cannot be reopened. The order appealed from is affirmed [3, 4].
