I. CAPTION
RIZALINA G. GALSIM and BENIGNO C. GALSIM v. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, G.R. No. L-23921, August 29, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Rizalina Galsim was a paying teller for the Philippine National Bank (PNB). On December 11, 1952, Deogracias Pauco, a receiving teller, approached Galsim and requested P10,000.00. Galsim handed him a bundle of P100 bills amounting to P10,000.00 without requiring him to sign a receipt or accomplish the requisite PNB Forms 33-B and 34-B, assuming he needed it for exchange. Pauco absconded with the money and lost it gambling. Consequently, the PNB Board of Directors passed a resolution dismissing Pauco and requiring Galsim to resign for gross negligence and violation of bank regulations.

PNB filed a civil suit against Galsim to recover the money, but she was exonerated by the lower courts. A criminal case for qualified theft against her was also dismissed. Galsim then filed a complaint for reinstatement and damages, arguing her dismissal was unwarranted given her exoneration. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed her complaint.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Galsim is entitled to reinstatement following her dismissal for loss of confidence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of Galsim's complaint. Under Section 23 of the PNB Charter (Act 2612), PNB employees are not subject to Civil Service Law, and the Board of Directors possesses the prerogative to hire and fire. While dismissal for loss of confidence must have a basis, an employee's subsequent acquittal in a criminal case or exoneration in a civil suit does not automatically entitle them to reinstatement if there is sufficient proof of breach of trust or acts inimical to the employer's interest.

The Court held that Galsim's position as a paying teller involved a high degree of trust. Her failure to secure the required PNB forms or a simple receipt for the transfer of a large sum (P10,000.00) constituted a violation of bank rules and gross negligence. This lapse facilitated Pauco's misappropriation of funds and caused prejudice to the bank. Thus, the bank had ample reason to lose confidence in her, making reinstatement irreconcilable with the nature of her position.

Judgment affirmed.
