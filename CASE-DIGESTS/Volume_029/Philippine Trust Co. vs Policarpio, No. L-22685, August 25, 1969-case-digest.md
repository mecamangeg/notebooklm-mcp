I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE TRUST COMPANY v. SIMEON POLICARPIO, MODESTA REYES, and ILUMINADA (LUMEN) R. POLICARPIO, G.R. No. L-22685, August 25, 1969, Barredo, J.

II. FACTS
Defendants Iluminada Policarpio and spouses Simeon Policarpio and Modesta Reyes obtained a loan (credit agreement) from plaintiff Philippine Trust Company, secured by real estate and chattel mortgages [1, 2]. The defendants failed to pay the monthly amortizations, realty taxes, and insurance premiums as agreed [3-5]. Consequently, the plaintiff filed a foreclosure suit. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila ruled in favor of the plaintiff, ordering the defendants to pay P444,569.00 plus interest and 10% attorney's fees [6]. The dispositive portion of the CFI decision stated that payment must be made "within the period provided by law," failing which the mortgaged properties would be sold [7]. Defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals (later certified to the Supreme Court), arguing that the trial court erred by failing to fix a specific period of not less than 90 days as required by Section 2, Rule 68 of the Rules of Court, thereby leaving them unsure of when they would incur default [8, 9]. They also questioned the award of attorney's fees [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court’s judgment is defective for failing to specify the 90-day payment period required by Rule 68.
2. W/N the award of 10% attorney's fees is excessive.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** While the Court admitted there was an "apparent incompleteness" in the trial court's decision for failing to fix the specific period of not less than 90 days pursuant to Section 2, Rule 68, the proper remedy for the defendants was not to appeal but to file a motion to fix the period or correct the flaw [9, 10]. The Supreme Court noted that the appeal appeared "merely dilatory" as defendants made no attempt to pay or tender payment during the long intervening period [11]. Citing *Rodriguez v. Caoibes*, the Court held that such omission can be supplied by amendment [12, 13]. Instead of remanding the case to the lower court to fix the period (which would cause further delay), the Supreme Court ordered that the judgment amount be paid within thirty (30) days from the finality of the decision [11, 14].

2. **YES.** Although the stipulation of 10% attorney's fees in the mortgage contract was not denied by the defendants and could be legally sustained, the Court exercised its discretion to reduce the amount [14]. The Supreme Court held that an award of 5% of the total judgment amount was sufficient for attorney's fees [14, 15].

**Judgment affirmed with modification.**
