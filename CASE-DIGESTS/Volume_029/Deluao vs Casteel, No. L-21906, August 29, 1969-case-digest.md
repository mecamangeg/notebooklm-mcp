I. CAPTION
**INOCENCIA DELUAO and FELIPE DELUAO v. NICANOR CASTEEL and JUAN DEPRA**, G.R. No. L-21906, August 29, 1969, 29 SCRA 350, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Nicanor Casteel (Casteel) filed a fishpond application for an area in Davao. Lacking funds for improvements, he borrowed money from Inocencia and Felipe Deluao (Deluaos). They executed a "contract of service" which established a partnership to divide the fishpond equally between them after the award. The Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DANR) subsequently approved Casteel's application and awarded the entire area to him. The Deluaos sought to enforce the partnership agreement. The Supreme Court previously decided the case on December 24, 1968, declaring the partnership to divide the fishpond illegal and void. The Deluaos filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that Fisheries Administrative Order (FAO) No. 14, Sec. 7, which prohibits transfers of fishpond rights, is inconsistent with the Fisheries Act, and that the prohibition should not apply prior to the issuance of a permit. They further argued that a trust was created by operation of law.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the contract of partnership to divide the fishpond is valid despite the prohibition in FAO No. 14.
2. W/N a trust was created in favor of the Deluaos under Article 1452 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The partnership is void as it has an illegal object. FAO No. 14, Sec. 7, which prohibits the transfer or sub-letting of fishponds without the DANR Secretary's prior approval, is consistent with Sec. 63 of the Fisheries Act (Act 4003). The Act limits the privilege of entering and constructing fishponds on public land to *holders* of permits or leases. Consequently, a partnership formed to divide a fishpond violates this legal prohibition and is contrary to public policy. The Court rejected the argument that the prohibition applies only after a permit is issued, noting that this would allow circumvention of the law. Since the fishpond is part of the public domain, equitable principles used in cases involving private property (like *Zamboanga* or *Evangelista*) cannot cure the nullity of the prohibited transfer.

2. **NO.** A trust cannot be established in violation of the law. The Court held that "trust is founded on equity and can never result from an act violative of the law." Article 1452 of the Civil Code regarding implied trusts contemplates property capable of private ownership, not fishponds of the public domain. Furthermore, the Court noted that the Deluaos themselves had effectively dissolved the partnership by previously rejecting Casteel's proposal to divide the fishpond.

**Motion for Reconsideration DENIED.**
