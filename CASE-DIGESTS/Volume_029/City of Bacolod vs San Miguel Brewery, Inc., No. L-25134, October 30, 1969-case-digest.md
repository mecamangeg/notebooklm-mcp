I. CAPTION
THE CITY OF BACOLOD v. SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC., G.R. No. L-25134, October 30, 1969, Barredo, J.

II. FACTS
The City of Bacolod passed Ordinance No. 66, series of 1949, as amended by Ordinance No. 150, series of 1959, imposing a bottling tax of P0.03 per case of soft drinks and a 2% monthly surcharge for delinquent fees [1, 2]. San Miguel Brewery, Inc. (SMB) refused to pay the increased tax [2]. In 1960, the City filed Civil Case No. 5693 to collect the unpaid bottling taxes but failed to include a claim for the surcharges [2-4]. The Court of First Instance (CFI) ruled in favor of the City, ordering SMB to pay the taxes, which the Supreme Court affirmed in G.R. No. L-18290 [5]. After the decision became final, the City attempted to collect the surcharges, but its motion was denied [5, 6].

Consequently, the City filed a second suit, Civil Case No. 7355, in 1964 specifically to collect the P36,519.10 representing the surcharges on the taxes paid late by SMB [7-9]. SMB moved to dismiss on the ground of splitting a single cause of action and bar by prior judgment, but the CFI denied the motion and ordered SMB to pay the surcharges [10, 11]. SMB appealed to the Supreme Court [11].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the City’s second action for the collection of surcharges is barred by the rule against splitting a single cause of action.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that SMB’s failure to pay the bottling charges and the consequent surcharges constituted but one single cause of action [12]. Under the Ordinance, the non-payment gave rise to two reliefs: (1) recovery of the basic charges, and (2) payment of surcharges [13]. The filing of separate complaints for each relief violates the rule against splitting a cause of action [13].

Under Section 4, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court, if separate complaints are brought for different parts of a single cause of action, the filing of the first may be pleaded in abatement of the others, and a judgment on the merits in either is available as a bar in the others [14, 15]. Since the City failed to claim the surcharges in the first case (Civil Case No. 5693), the final judgment therein operates as *res judicata*, barring the subsequent suit for surcharges [15].

The judgment of the lower court is reversed and the complaint is dismissed [16].
