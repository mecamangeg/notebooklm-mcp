I. CAPTION
DR. ADRIANO B. VELASQUEZ v. ATTY. APOLONIO BARRERA, Adm. Case No. 415, August 29, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Dr. Adriano Velasquez filed a disbarment case against Respondent Atty. Apolonio Barrera for alleged misappropriation of funds and conflict of interest. The case stemmed from an ejectment case against the complainant's brother, Pedro Velasquez, in the Municipal Court of Baguio. After Pedro lost, Respondent helped perfect an appeal to the Court of First Instance (CFI) and assisted in filing a supersedeas bond [1, 2]. To secure the bond, the Ymson brothers acted as counter-guarantors, and to protect the Ymsons, the Complainant executed a chattel mortgage over his personal properties in their favor [3, 4].

Pedro eventually lost the appeal, and the surety company sought reimbursement from the Ymsons. Consequently, the Ymsons, represented by Respondent, filed a fourth-party complaint against the Complainant and foreclosed on the chattel mortgage [5, 6]. Respondent also acted as private prosecutor in a criminal case for estafa against the Complainant regarding the mortgaged property [7, 8]. Complainant alleged that Respondent misappropriated P220 given for appeal expenses and committed misconduct by representing the Ymsons against him after having acted as counsel for his brother and advising him on the mortgage [9, 10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Respondent misappropriated client funds.
2. W/N Respondent is guilty of representing conflicting interests.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court found that the P100 delivered to Respondent was accounted for, having been used to pay docket fees, appeal bonds, registration fees, and notarial fees totaling P85.30. The balance of P14.70 was reasonably retained as partial compensation for services rendered in perfecting the appeal and preparing the legal documents [11]. The allegation regarding an additional P120 was not supported by convincing evidence [12].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that no attorney-client relationship existed between the Complainant and the Respondent. While Respondent assisted Complainant's brother (Pedro) in the ejectment appeal and the preparation of the bond, he did not enter a formal appearance in the CFI, nor did he sign pleadings for them in that instance [8]. The Court held that the mere contact between Complainant and Respondent regarding the bond and mortgage did not create a confidential lawyer-client relationship [13]. Therefore, there was no legal impediment to Respondent representing the Ymsons in the foreclosure and criminal case against the Complainant [14].

**However**, the Court noted that Respondent should have been more careful. His intervention in the municipal court and assistance with the appeal created an impression that he was the counsel of record, leading the Complainant to believe there was a conflict of interest when Respondent later appeared for the Ymsons [15, 16].

The Respondent was **ADMONISHED** to be more careful in the future in his relations with litigants and warned that similar conduct would be dealt with more drastically [16].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
