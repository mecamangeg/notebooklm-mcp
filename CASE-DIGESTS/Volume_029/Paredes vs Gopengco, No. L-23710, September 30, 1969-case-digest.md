I. CAPTION
ANTONIO PAREDES, in his capacity as Judge, Branch II, City Court of Manila; ANTONIO J. VILLEGAS, as Mayor of the City of Manila; and LADISLAO J. TOLENTINO, as City Engineer of Manila v. HON. SIMEON M. GOPENGCO, in his capacity as Judge, Branch XXV, Court of First Instance of Manila, MANUFACTURERS BUILDING, INC., and AMBROSIO PADILLA, G.R. No. L-23710, September 30, 1969, Teehankee, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Mayor Antonio Villegas and City Engineer Ladislao Tolentino were accused of malicious mischief in the City Court of Manila, assigned to Branch II presided by Petitioner Judge Antonio Paredes [1]. Respondents Manufacturers Building, Inc. and Ambrosio Padilla filed a motion for Judge Paredes to disqualify himself, alleging that the law firm representing the accused was headed by the Judge's father, former Senator Quintin Paredes [1]. Judge Paredes denied the motion because the firm was not the counsel of record, although they handled the preliminary investigation [1].

Respondents filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. Respondent Judge Simeon Gopengco issued a preliminary injunction restraining Judge Paredes from proceeding with the case [2]. Petitioners filed the instant case, arguing that Judge Gopengco acted with grave abuse of discretion by disregarding Rule 137, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, which provides that "no appeal or stay shall be allowed from, or by reason of, (the trial judge's) decision in favor of his own competency, until after final judgment in the case" [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the restriction in Rule 137, Section 2 against appeal or stay of proceedings applies to criminal cases where the disqualification of the judge is sought by the prosecution or offended party.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The prohibition in Rule 137, Section 2 applies only to civil cases or to criminal cases where the *accused* seeks the disqualification, as they have the remedy of appeal after final judgment [4], [5].

However, where the **prosecution or offended party** seeks disqualification, the rule does not apply. If the trial judge proceeds and renders a verdict of acquittal, the prosecution has no right to appeal due to the constitutional protection against **double jeopardy** [4], [5]. Since they would have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to review the judge's adverse ruling on competency, they are entitled to resort to the extraordinary remedies of prohibition and certiorari [6].

The Court further held that while a decision rendered by a disqualified judge is not null and void for lack of jurisdiction but merely constitutes a reversible error, the lack of appellate recourse for the prosecution justifies the issuance of the writ [7], [8]. The Court also observed that, in the interest of justice, Judge Paredes should inhibit himself [9].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the petition is dismissed [10].
