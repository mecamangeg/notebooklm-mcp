I. CAPTION
BARBARA LOMBOS RODRIGUEZ v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS, ATANACIO VALENZUELA, MAXIMINA VICTORIO, LIBERATA SANTOS, NIEVES CRUZ (substituted by her heirs), and CARMEN and ARSENIA MENDOZA, G.R. No. L-29264, August 29, 1969, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Nieves Cruz authorized respondents Atanacio Valenzuela, et al. to sell her land in Parañaque. Respondents made partial payments totaling P47,198.60, evidenced by receipts stating the amounts were "additional payments for the land we sold to them." The land registration court decreed the registration of the land in Cruz's name subject to the rights of respondents for the payments made. Subsequently, Cruz sold the same land to petitioner Barbara Lombos Rodriguez, and a new title was issued to Rodriguez carrying the annotation of respondents' rights. Cruz filed an action to rescind the agency agreement, while respondents counterclaimed for the annulment of the sale to Rodriguez and reconveyance of the property, arguing the agency had been novated into a sale. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Cruz and Rodriguez. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the decision, upholding the sale to respondents and ordering Rodriguez to reconvey the land. Rodriguez filed this petition, raising for the first time the issue that the CA lacked appellate jurisdiction because the value of the land allegedly exceeded P200,000, which under the law at the time fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Appeals had appellate jurisdiction over the case.
2. W/N petitioner is estopped from questioning the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.
3. W/N the oral contract of sale between Cruz and respondents was valid and binding on petitioner.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The time when the value of real estate is to be resolved for jurisdictional purposes is prior to or simultaneously with the perfection of the appeal. The records available at the time the appeal was perfected showed the land's value was not in excess of P200,000. Under Rule 41, Section 9, the appellate court acquires jurisdiction upon the perfection of the appeal based on the records a quo.

2. **YES.** The petitioner is barred by the doctrine of estoppel by laches. The Supreme Court applied the ruling in *Tijam v. Sibonghanoy* (G.R. No. L-21450), holding that a party cannot invoke the jurisdiction of a court to secure affirmative relief and then, after obtaining an adverse ruling, repudiate that same jurisdiction. Petitioner allowed an unreasonable period to lapse—participating in the CA proceedings and even filing a prior petition in the SC—before raising the jurisdictional issue only after the CA decision became unfavorable.

3. **YES.** The oral contract of sale was ratified conformably with Article 1405 of the Civil Code (Statute of Frauds) because Cruz accepted partial payments and failed to object to oral evidence proving the sale. The sale was also established in the land registration proceedings, which is a proceeding in rem binding on successors-in-interest. Petitioner, having bought the land with the annotated encumbrance, acted in bad faith and must reconvey the property.

**Petition DENIED.**
