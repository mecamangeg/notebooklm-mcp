**I. CAPTION**
THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR HABEAS CORPUS OF AQUILINO DEL ROSARIO, JR. and AQUILINO DEL ROSARIO, SR. v. JUANITA OLIDAR VDA. DE MERCADO, G.R. No. L-25710, August 28, 1969, Fernando, J.

**II. FACTS**
On July 11, 1965, petitioner Aquilino del Rosario, Jr., a member of the municipal police force of Aringay, La Union, shot Orencio Mercado, who died two days later [1]. As no police officer filed a case, the victim's widow, respondent Juanita Olidar Vda. de Mercado, subscribed and filed a criminal complaint for Murder against Aquilino, Jr. in the Municipal Court of Aringay [1, 2]. A warrant of arrest was issued, and Aquilino, Jr. was detained [2].

Petitioners filed a petition for habeas corpus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of La Union, arguing that the warrant was void because the complaint was not signed by the "offended party" as required by Rule 110, Section 2 of the Rules of Court [2, 3]. They contended the widow was merely an heir, not the offended party [2]. The CFI granted the petition, ruling that "offended party" refers only to the person actually injured (the deceased), and thus the widow's complaint was void [4]. The widow appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a widow is considered an "offended party" authorized to file a criminal complaint for the murder of her husband under the Rules of Court.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. A widow is an "offended party" within the meaning of **Section 2, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court** regarding the prosecution of offenses [3, 6]. The Court reasoned that the widow suffers distinct injury through the "loss of right of consortium and material support" [7, 8]. To hold otherwise would defy logic and common sense given the unity of the marital relationship [8, 9].

Furthermore, public policy demands this interpretation. Restricting the right to file to peace officers could obstruct justice, particularly in cases where the accused is a member of the police force—as in this case—where camaraderie might paralyze fellow officers from filing a complaint [10, 11]. The Court expressly distinguished and rejected any implication from the previous ruling in *Guevarra v. Del Rosario* that would bar a widow from being considered an offended party [12, 13].

The decision of the lower court granting the writ of habeas corpus was **REVERSED**, and the case was **REMANDED** to the Municipal Court of Aringay for further proceedings [13].
