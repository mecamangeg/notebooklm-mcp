**I. CAPTION**
JOSE MARIA ANDUIZA and NENITA DEZALISA ANDUIZA v. SANTOS DY-KIA and HON. VALERIANO A. DEL VALLE, as Judge of the COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, ALBAY, NINTH REGIONAL DISTRICT, G.R. No. L-23757, August 29, 1969, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondents Santos Dy-Kia filed a tenancy case in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) against Filomena Cajarito Vda. de Dy-Kia for reimbursement of improvements. Petitioners, spouses Anduiza, were impleaded as respondents after purchasing the land from Filomena. On May 4, 1963, the CAR issued an order dismissing the petition specifically against the Anduiza spouses, finding no tenancy relationship existed. Subsequently, on August 1, 1963, the CAR dismissed the entire case for lack of jurisdiction.

Dy-Kia filed a motion for reconsideration (MR) of the August 1 order on August 20, 1963, which the CAR denied on August 29, 1963. Notice of this denial was sent to Dy-Kia’s counsel of record, Atty. Hernandez, by registered mail; the first notice was given on September 9, 1963, but the mail was returned unclaimed. Months later, a new counsel for Dy-Kia appeared and filed a "second" MR on March 31, 1964. The CAR, in orders dated August 22, 1964 and September 12, 1964, granted Dy-Kia’s MR and reopened the case "in the interest of justice." The CAR also denied the Anduizas' motion for execution of the dismissal orders. The Anduizas petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing the dismissal had already become final and executory.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petition for certiorari is proper despite the challenged orders being interlocutory in nature.
2. W/N the CAR orders reopening the case are void because the prior order of dismissal had already become final and executory.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** While the general rule under Section 1, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court is that only final orders of the Agrarian Court are appealable and interlocutory orders (like granting a new trial) are not, the Supreme Court may treat an appeal as a special civil action for certiorari. The Court held that when a petition alleges want or excess of jurisdiction or abuse of discretion, an appeal may be converted into certiorari "to avert injustice and thwart delay." Here, the petitioners sufficiently alleged that the CAR judge acted without jurisdiction and with grave abuse of discretion, satisfying the requirements of Rule 65.

2. **YES.** The orders of dismissal had become final and executory before the CAR attempted to reopen the case in 1964. Under Section 4, Rule 43, in relation to Section 1, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, a CAR judgment becomes final upon the expiration of 15 days from notice.
   *   The May 4, 1963 order dismissing the Anduizas became final because Dy-Kia failed to file a timely appeal or motion within the reglementary period.
   *   Regarding the August 1, 1963 dismissal, the denial of the MR (August 29 order) was deemed served on Dy-Kia’s counsel five days after the first notice from the postmaster (September 9) was ignored. Applying Section 8, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court, service was completed on September 15, 1963.
   *   Since the new counsel filed the next motion only on March 31, 1964—more than six months later—the judgment had long become final. Courts cannot "bandy judgments about" or determine them term after term; public policy demands judgments become final at a definite date (citing *Dy Cay vs. Crossfield & O'Brien*). Consequently, the CAR lost jurisdiction to issue the disputed orders reopening the case.

**WHEREFORE**, the writ of certiorari is granted; the disputed orders of August 22, 1964, September 12, 1964, and October 26, 1964 are set aside and declared null and void; and the order of May 4, 1963 dismissing the case against petitioners is declared final and executory.
