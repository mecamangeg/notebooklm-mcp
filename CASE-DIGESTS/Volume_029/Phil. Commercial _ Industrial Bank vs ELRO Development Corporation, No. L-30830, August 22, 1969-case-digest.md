I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL BANK v. ELRO DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-30830, August 22, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Philippine Commercial & Industrial Bank (PCIB) filed a collection suit in the City Court of Manila against ELRO Development Corporation (ELRO) for the unpaid balance of a promissory note [1]. The City Court ruled in favor of PCIB. ELRO appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [1]. PCIB's complaint incorporated a copy of the promissory note [1]. ELRO's answer failed to deny the due execution of the note under oath, merely denying the outstanding balance [1, 2]. During pre-trial, ELRO's counsel admitted the execution of the note [3]. At trial, PCIB presented the note and statement of account as documentary evidence, which the court admitted [4]. ELRO failed to present evidence [4]. The CFI rendered judgment for PCIB. ELRO filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing the documents were inadmissible because no witness testified to their execution [3]. The CFI denied the motion, and ELRO appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the promissory note was admissible in evidence without authentication by witness testimony.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision. The Court ruled that proof of due execution and authenticity of the private writing (promissory note) was dispensed with because the defendant failed to deny under oath the authenticity and due execution of the actionable document attached to the complaint [3]. Furthermore, ELRO's counsel admitted these facts during the pre-trial [3]. The Court noted that ELRO's denial of the outstanding balance was insufficient as it failed to allege specific payments with definiteness [2].

Decision affirmed with double costs against the defendant-appellant [5].
