I. CAPTION
CRISPINIANO BLANCO v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, TOMAS DRAGON and ERLINDA DOMULOT, G.R. Nos. L-21385-86, August 22, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On June 18, 1956, a truck loaded with logs and owned by petitioner Crispiniano Blanco turned turtle in Masinloc, Zambales, killing Tomas Dragon and Diomedes Basa [1]. Blanco had been engaged in the logging business since 1948, and the deceased were on board to help deliver logs [1]. The heirs of Dragon and Basa filed claims for death compensation [2]. Blanco denied liability, alleging there was no employer-employee relationship and that he was unaware they were on the truck [2]. He also paid P500 to the heirs, allegedly to settle the criminal case against his driver [2].

The Hearing Officers initially denied the claims for failure to prove an employer-employee relationship [3]. However, the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed the decision and awarded compensation [3]. Blanco appealed to the Supreme Court, raising the defense of prescription for the first time and questioning the WCC's findings on the employment relationship [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claims for compensation are barred by prescription.
2. W/N there existed an employer-employee relationship between the petitioner and the deceased.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The defense of prescription cannot be raised for the first time on appeal; it is presumed waived if the employer fails to plead it before or during the trial [5]. The Court cited *Regalado v. Visayan Shipping Co.* to support this waiver [5]. Furthermore, under Section 45 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, the petitioner's failure to controvert the claim within the period provided by law barred him from invoking the defense of prescription [6].

2. **YES.** The WCC correctly found sufficient evidence to prove the relationship, including: (1) Blanco's ownership of the truck involved in the accident; (2) his payment of P500 to the claimants; (3) testimonies of witnesses who were former woodcutters for Blanco; and (4) the affidavit of the driver, which corroborated the other evidence [7].

The decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission is **AFFIRMED** [8].
