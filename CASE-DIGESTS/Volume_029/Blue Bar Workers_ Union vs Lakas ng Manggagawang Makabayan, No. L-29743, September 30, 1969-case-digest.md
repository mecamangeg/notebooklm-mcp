I. CAPTION
BLUE BAR WORKERS' UNION v. LAKAS NG MANGGAGAWANG MAKABAYAN and THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-29743, September 30, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On September 20, 1967, PLUM Federation petitioned the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) for certification as the bargaining representative of Blue Bar Coconut Philippines, Inc. employees [1]. Petitioner Blue Bar Workers' Union intervened, claiming an existing Collective Bargaining Agreement with the company [1]. During the consent election on July 3, 1968, Petitioner's name appeared in parentheses below the name of Respondent Lakas ng Manggagawang Makabayan (Lakas) on the ballots [2]. The tally showed 526 votes for the Lakas/Petitioner group versus 155 for PLUM [2].

However, the CIR certified Respondent Lakas as the sole bargaining agent, effectively disregarding Petitioner [3]. After the CIR denied its motion for reconsideration, Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [4]. While the case was pending, Respondent Lakas informed the company by letter that its local officers were voluntarily joining Petitioner and that it was waiving all rights and claims regarding union recognition in favor of Petitioner [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Blue Bar Workers' Union should be recognized as the sole collective bargaining representative of the employees.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled in favor of the Petitioner due to the voluntary unification of the rival unions during the pendency of the appeal. Respondent Lakas explicitly ceded its rights and claims to Petitioner and requested that the company recognize Petitioner as the sole exclusive bargaining representative [5]. As the controversy effectively came to an end with this development, the Court granted the petition, declared Blue Bar Workers' Union as the sole bargaining representative, and made the preliminary injunction against the CIR orders permanent [6].
