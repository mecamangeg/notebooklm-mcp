I. CAPTION
ARSENIA GUARDIANO v. JORGE ENCARNACION, G.R. No. L-23396, August 29, 1969, 29 SCRA 326, Teehankee, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Arsenia Guardiano was the actual occupant of Lot 18, Block E-148 of the PHHC East Avenue Subdivision since 1945. On February 8, 1957, respondent Jorge Encarnacion filed an application to purchase the same lot, received a tentative award, and paid P810.00 as a 10% deposit. A "Conditional Contract to Sell" form was prepared but remained blank and was never signed by the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC). Upon inspection, PHHC discovered Guardiano’s occupancy. Citing the policy of prioritizing actual occupants, PHHC Manager Orosa cancelled the award to Encarnacion and offered him a substitute lot, which Encarnacion ignored. Instead, Encarnacion assigned his rights to the deposit to a third party.

Encarnacion filed a complaint for specific performance against PHHC to compel the execution of the sale. Guardiano intervened. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Encarnacion. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that a perfected contract existed due to the agreement on the subject matter and price, and the partial execution via the deposit.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N there was a perfected contract of sale between PHHC and Encarnacion.
2. W/N Guardiano has a preferential right to purchase the lot over Encarnacion.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** There was no perfected contract of sale. The record showed that the alleged "Conditional Contract to Sell" was a blank form that was never executed or signed by the PHHC. The transaction was limited to an application to purchase and a tentative award. The P810.00 payment was accepted expressly as a deposit, not as a down payment that would imply a perfected contract. Citing *Galvez v. Vda. de Kangleon*, the Court held that a sales memorandum or allocation of land forwarded to a prospective purchaser does not create a perfected contract if the deed or contract remains unexecuted.

2. **YES.** The Court sustained the PHHC's action in upholding the preferential right of a *bona fide* occupant over an outsider. The underlying government policy in distributing home lots is to give preference to actual occupants (squatters) over others to provide them with homes. Furthermore, the Court applied the principle of administrative law that in the absence of error, abuse of power, or lack of jurisdiction, the action of an administrative agency like the PHHC in enforcing its charter and policies should not be disturbed by the judicial department.

Petition granted. Decision reversed.
