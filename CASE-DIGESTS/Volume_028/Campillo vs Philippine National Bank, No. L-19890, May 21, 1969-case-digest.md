I. CAPTION
SOSTENES CAMPILLO v. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK and THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF PASAY CITY, G.R. No. L-19890, May 21, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Sostenes Campillo obtained a judgment for a sum of money against Justiniano D. Quirino. Pursuant to an alias writ of execution, the Sheriff attached and levied upon Quirino's parcel of land covered by T.C.T. No. 236-A on March 16, 1960. The notice of levy was registered on the same date [1]. Philippine National Bank (PNB) filed a third-party claim, alleging it was the mortgagee, but the execution sale proceeded on April 8, 1960, where Campillo emerged as the highest bidder [2]. The certificate of sale was registered on April 12, 1960. Upon the expiration of the redemption period, a final deed of sale was executed in Campillo's favor [3].

PNB later claimed it had already acquired ownership of the property through an extra-judicial foreclosure sale held on December 17, 1958, long before Campillo's levy [4]. However, PNB’s foreclosure sale was only registered with the Register of Deeds on April 21, 1960—after Campillo had already registered his levy [5]. The Court of First Instance declared Campillo the owner, ruling that PNB's unregistered sale could not bind third parties [6], [7]. PNB appealed, arguing that Quirino no longer owned the property at the time of the levy [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the execution sale to Campillo prevails over PNB's prior but unregistered extra-judicial foreclosure sale.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling in favor of Campillo [9].

The Court held that a sale of real estate, whether resulting from a private transaction, foreclosure, or execution sale, becomes legally effective against third persons only from the date of its registration, pursuant to Section 50 of Act 496 (Land Registration Act) [10]. Although PNB's foreclosure sale occurred in 1958, it was not registered until April 21, 1960. Conversely, Campillo’s attachment and levy were registered on March 16, 1960 [5].

At the time of Campillo's levy, the property was still registered in the name of Quirino in the official records. Therefore, the property was properly levied upon as Quirino's property. Campillo acquired the rights of Quirino subject only to the liens and encumbrances annotated on the certificate of title at the time of the levy. Since PNB's foreclosure sale was unregistered at that time, it did not affect Campillo's rights [10].

Judgment affirmed [9].
