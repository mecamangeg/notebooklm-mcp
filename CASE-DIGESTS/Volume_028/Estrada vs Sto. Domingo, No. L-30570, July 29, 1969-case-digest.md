I. CAPTION
JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA and HON. ANDRES REYES v. BRAULIO STO. DOMINGO and the COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-30570, July 29, 1969, 28 SCRA 890, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
In the 1967 elections for Mayor of San Juan, Rizal, the board of canvassers proclaimed respondent Braulio Sto. Domingo as winner. Petitioner Joseph Estrada filed an election protest in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal. On October 29, 1968, the CFI rendered a decision annulling Sto. Domingo's proclamation and declaring Estrada the duly elected Mayor. On the last day of the five-day period to appeal (November 4, 1968), Sto. Domingo filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) by registered mail but failed to attach the required affidavit of service.

The CFI denied the MR on November 25, 1968, ruling it was *pro forma* as it merely reiterated arguments already decided, and fatally defective for lack of proof of service. Consequently, the CFI declared the decision final and executory. On the same day, Sto. Domingo filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus with the Court of Appeals (CA), alleging the CFI Judge failed to resolve the MR on the merits. The CA issued a restraining order and subsequently rendered a decision annulling the CFI's order of finality and directing it to resolve the MR on the merits. Estrada appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Motion for Reconsideration filed by Sto. Domingo was *pro forma* and suspended the period for appeal.
2. W/N the special civil action for certiorari filed in the Court of Appeals may be treated as an appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the motion was *pro forma*. The Court reasoned that where a motion for reconsideration in an election protest presents questions which have already been considered by the court prior to the promulgation of the decision, said motion is *pro forma* and does not suspend the running of the period for appeal. The grounds raised by Sto. Domingo (exclusion of voters, rejected ballots, and tampered ballots) had already been passed upon by the trial court in its main decision. Furthermore, the motion failed to comply with Rule 13, Section 10 regarding proof of service by mail (lack of affidavit), rendering it a mere scrap of paper. Consequently, the period to appeal expired, and the judgment became final and executory.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the special civil action cannot be treated as an appeal to avoid delay or thwart injustice because Sto. Domingo deliberately discarded his right to appeal in favor of a special civil action to delay proceedings. He cannot gamble with one court proceeding and, failing in that, resort to another. The petition in the CA was bereft of any intention to appeal; rather, it sought to remand the case. As the remedy of appeal was lost through his own tactical maneuvers and not through error or excusable negligence, it cannot be revived.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is set aside, and the judgment of the CFI declaring Estrada the duly elected Mayor is declared final and executory as of November 5, 1968.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Dizon, J. (Concurring):**
Agreed that the MR was *pro forma* and fatally defective for lack of an affidavit of service, rendering it a "scrap of paper" that did not toll the appeal period. Noted that while the doctrine in *Arnedo v. Llorente* (denying CFI authority to resolve MRs in election cases) has been abandoned, election laws must still be strictly followed to prevent delay.

**Barredo, J. (Concurring):**
Opined that the practice of filing ordinary motions for reconsideration in election cases should be outlawed to prevent "proclamation grabbers" from using dilatory tactics. Emphasized that Sto. Domingo's motion was a mere repetition of previous arguments and a transparent stratagem to delay the final outcome.
