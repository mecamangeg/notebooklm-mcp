I. CAPTION
ANATOLIO VALENCIA v. MANILA YACHT CLUB, INC., G.R. No. L-27346, June 30, 1969, 28 SCRA 724, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Anatolio Valencia worked as a laborer for the Manila Yacht Club for 11 years, working from 4:00 PM to midnight and often exposed to the elements [1]. In April 1960, he suffered an injury when a rope snapped, throwing him against a boat, and was subsequently found to be suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis [1, 2]. He became disabled on April 12, 1960 [3]. Valencia filed a claim for compensation and medical expenses against the Club in the Manila Municipal Court under Article 1711 of the Civil Code [1].

The Club moved to dismiss the case, arguing that because Valencia was a member of the Social Security System (SSS) and had already received SSS benefits, he was precluded from demanding further compensation [4]. The Municipal Court granted the motion and dismissed the case [4]. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Manila affirmed the dismissal on the same ground [4]. Valencia appealed to the Supreme Court on a question of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an employee can demand compensation from their employer under Article 1711 of the Civil Code notwithstanding the previous receipt of benefits under the Social Security Law.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that an employee’s right to demand compensation from the employer is not barred by the previous receipt of benefits under the Social Security Law [5, 6]. The Court distinguished the nature of the two benefits: SSS benefits are paid to members by reason of their membership and contributions, serving as insurance against hazards like sickness, disability, or death, regardless of whether these arose from employment [7, 8]. Conversely, compensation under Article 1711 of the Civil Code (similar to the Workmen's Compensation Act) is an indemnity for injury or damage suffered by the employee specifically *on account of the employment* [8, 9].

Citing *Rural Transit Employees Assn. v. Bachrach Trans. Co.* and *Benguet Consolidated, Inc. v. SSS*, the Court reasoned that denying compensation because of SSS benefits would deprive employees of the statutory benefits they purchased through their SSS contributions [5, 7]. Article 1711 explicitly obliges employers to pay compensation for injuries or illnesses arising out of employment, and this provision remains applicable and controlling [9].

The order of dismissal is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **REMANDED** to the court of origin for the determination of the amount of compensation and medical expenses [10].
