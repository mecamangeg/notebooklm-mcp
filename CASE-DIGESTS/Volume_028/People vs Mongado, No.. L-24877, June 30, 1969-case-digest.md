I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GAUDENCIO MONGADO, JILLY SEGADOR, and BELESANDE SALAR, G.R. No. L-24877, June 30, 1969, 28 SCRA 642, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On March 17, 1965, in Mainit, Surigao del Norte, the accused Gaudencio Mongado, Jilly Segador, and Belesande Salar entered the residence of spouses Silvino Lincuna and Emilia Dalit, who were Mongado's uncle and aunt [1], [2]. With intent to gain and kill, they robbed the couple and attacked them; Silvino was clubbed, tied helplessly to a chair, and stabbed, while Emilia was stabbed [3]. While Emilia was dying but still alive, Salar raped her [4]. Charged with Robbery with Double Homicide and Rape under a Second Amended Information, all three accused pleaded guilty [5], [1]. The trial court, without receiving further evidence, relied on the accused's affidavits attached to the record to appreciate several aggravating circumstances and imposed the death penalty [6], [7]. The case was elevated to the Supreme Court for automatic review [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in considering affidavits not formally offered in evidence to determine aggravating circumstances.
2. W/N the unqualified plea of guilty constitutes an admission of the aggravating circumstances alleged in the information.
3. W/N the aggravating circumstances of treachery, ignominy, and dwelling were correctly appreciated.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled it was clear error for the trial court to consider the affidavits of admission attached to the record because they were not formally offered [7]. Under Section 35, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court, the court shall consider no evidence which has not been formally offered [8]. Affidavits are generally hearsay and inadmissible unless properly offered and admitted; thus, the findings must rest solely on the facts alleged in the information to which the accused pleaded guilty [7], [9].

2. **YES.** An unqualified plea of guilty constitutes an admission of all material facts alleged in the information, including the aggravating circumstances therein stated [10]. The only exceptions are conclusions of fact and mere conjectures [11]. Consequently, a plea of guilty is sufficient to sustain a conviction for a capital offense without the introduction of further evidence [11].

3. **YES (as to Treachery and Dwelling) and NO (as to Ignominy).**
   - **Treachery:** Properly appreciated [12]. While the general rule is that treachery must attend the inception of the attack, *alevosia* is present if a victim is first seized and bound to render him helpless before being slain [13]. The information alleged Mongado tied the victim helplessly before the killing [12].
   - **Ignominy:** Not present. Rape adds ignominy only if committed in the presence or with the knowledge of the husband, which was not the case here [14]. However, the rape itself is considered a distinct aggravating circumstance in the special complex crime of robbery with homicide [15].
   - **Dwelling:** Properly appreciated. Dwelling is aggravating in robbery with violence or intimidation of persons because such crimes can be committed without transgressing the sanctity of the home [16], [17].

   The Supreme Court affirmed the death penalty, finding the crime attended by treachery, dwelling, and rape (and recidivism for Mongado), offset only by the mitigating circumstance of the plea of guilty [18], [19].
