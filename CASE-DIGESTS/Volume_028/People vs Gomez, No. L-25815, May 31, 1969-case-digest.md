I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RAMON GOMEZ and RICARDO ALCANTARA, G.R. No. L-25815, May 31, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On August 9, 1958, at about 8:30 PM, Adelaida Roy Rubio was shot and killed inside her house in Meycauayan, Bulacan, by two masked intruders. Two years later, Ramon Gomez and Ricardo Alcantara were charged with murder. The prosecution's star witness, the victim's 13-year-old son Buenaventura Rubio, identified Gomez as the gunman based on his physique and "hairy arms" [1, 2]. The prosecution also presented two extra-judicial confessions executed by Alcantara (Exhibits "A" and "B"), wherein he admitted to acting as a lookout/guard downstairs while Gomez and another man went up to kill the victim [3]. At trial, Alcantara repudiated his confessions, claiming they were extracted through maltreatment by the Constabulary, and interposed an alibi [4]. The Court of First Instance of Bulacan convicted both accused of murder and sentenced them to *reclusión perpetua* [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the identification of Gomez by the eyewitness is sufficient to sustain a conviction.
2. W/N Alcantara's extra-judicial confessions are admissible and sufficient to prove his guilt despite his claim of coercion.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the identification was insufficient and unreliable. The witness admitted the killers' faces were covered. Identification based solely on "build, height" and "hairy arms" cannot be relied upon as these are common traits without specific identificatory value [7]. Furthermore, the identification procedure was flawed; the witness identified Gomez two years after the crime in a lineup where Gomez was mixed with soldiers rather than civilians, rendering the identification invalid and untrustworthy [8].

2. **YES.** The Court rejected the claim of coercion because Alcantara failed to disclose the alleged maltreatment to the Fiscal or the Justice of the Peace when he swore to the truth of his statements [4]. The confession contained details the police could not have known (e.g., Alcantara jumping bail in another case) and minimized Alcantara's role to a mere guard, which investigators would not likely concoct if they were framing him [9, 10]. His alibi was weak, uncorroborated, and the location was close to the crime scene [11]. Having admitted to standing guard while his companions executed the crime, Alcantara is liable as a principal by conspiracy [12].

**Disposition:** The decision is MODIFIED. Ramon Gomez is ACQUITTED. The conviction of Ricardo Alcantara is AFFIRMED.
