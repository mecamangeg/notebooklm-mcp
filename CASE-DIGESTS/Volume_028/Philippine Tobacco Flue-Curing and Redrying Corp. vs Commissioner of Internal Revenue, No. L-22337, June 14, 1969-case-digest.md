I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE TOBACCO FLUE-CURING AND REDRYING CORPORATION v. THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-22337, June 14, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner applied for a barter permit to export local tobacco and import approximately 10 million pounds of U.S. Virginia leaf tobacco. The government granted Barter Permit No. BT-1830, which contained a specific condition that the "permit cannot be transferred, assigned or negotiated." Upon the arrival of the tobacco in Manila, petitioner endorsed the bills of lading in blank to various local cigarette manufacturers. These manufacturers then obtained the release of the goods from Customs without paying the advance sales tax, as they would be exempt if considered the importers. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed petitioner P2,507,693.17 for advance sales tax, arguing petitioner remained the importer. Petitioner appealed, claiming the manufacturers were the true importers by virtue of the endorsed documents. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the assessment.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner is liable for the advance sales tax as the importer of the tobacco.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's decision. The Court held that the condition in the barter permit prohibiting transfer or assignment was manifestly intended to ensure the petitioner retained its character as the importer in the eyes of the law. Had the local cigarette manufacturers been considered the importers, they would have been exempt from the advance sales tax; thus, petitioner’s attempt to transfer the documents was a scheme to evade the tax liability of P2,507,693.17. Furthermore, contracts between the petitioner and the manufacturers explicitly referred to petitioner as the "importer" and the manufacturers as "buyers." The Court ruled that the privilege to import despite the existing Central Bank ban did not exempt petitioner from applicable tax laws.

Decision affirmed.
