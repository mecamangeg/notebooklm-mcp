I. CAPTION
SY OH v. HON. GREGORIO N. GARCIA and PIVGETH INDUSTRIES & DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION; LIM CHI v. HON. GREGORIO N. GARCIA and PIVGETH INDUSTRIES & DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, G.R. Nos. L-29328 & L-29589, June 30, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Sy Oh and Lim Chi occupied the Arias Building in Manila under verbal lease contracts with respondent Pivgeth Industries & Development Corp. [1]. On July 21, 1967, Pivgeth filed ejectment suits against them in the City Court of Manila [1]. Petitioners moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the one-year period for unlawful detainer had prescribed because the first demand to vacate was sent as early as April 27, 1964 [1]. The City Court denied the motions, ruling that the suit was filed on time because the final letters of demand were sent on September 30, 1966, and September 29, 1966, respectively [1]. The Court of First Instance of Manila affirmed the City Court’s jurisdiction [2]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the reckoning point of the one-year period [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the one-year period for filing an ejectment suit is reckoned from the date of the last letter of demand. [3]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that in the event of various letters of demand, the one-year period for ejectment suits is to be counted from the **last** letter of demand [4, 5]. The Court relied on the doctrine in *Racaza v. Susana Realty, Inc.* (1966) and *Calubayan v. Pascual* (1967), which posits that a lessor has the right to waive the action based on the first demand and allow the lessee to remain in the premises [2, 4]. Since the suits were filed within one year of the last demands sent in September 1966, the City Court had proper jurisdiction [1]. The decisions of the lower courts were affirmed [6].
