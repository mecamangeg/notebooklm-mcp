**I. CAPTION**
**CLEMENTE ALVIAR v. CESAREO ALVIAR, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-22402, June 30, 1969, 28 SCRA 130, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Belen Alviar died intestate, single, and without issue on September 6, 1951. She was survived by her full brother, Clemente Alviar (Petitioner), and five half-brothers and sisters (Respondents), children of their common father by a second marriage. Belen's estate consisted of two agricultural lots in Calamba, Laguna, and one residential lot in Pasay City. On June 28, 1955, the parties executed a Deed of Extrajudicial Partition: Clemente received the two agricultural lots, while the five half-siblings received the Pasay residential lot.

Over five years later, Clemente filed a suit to annul the partition and titles issued to the respondents, arguing that as a full-blood brother, he is a nearer relative and should exclude the half-blood siblings from the inheritance. The Court of First Instance ruled that the full brother does not exclude the half-siblings but ordered a redistribution of the Pasay lot (2/7 to Clemente and 1/7 to each half-sibling), while leaving the agricultural lots with Clemente. The respondents appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N brothers and sisters of the full blood exclude those of the half blood in intestate succession.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that brothers and sisters of full blood do not exclude those of half blood. Under Article 963 of the Civil Code, proximity of relationship is determined by generations. Both Clemente and the respondents form the first generation of descendants of their common father, placing them in the same degree of relationship to the deceased. Furthermore, Articles 1003, 1004, and 1006 of the Civil Code explicitly govern the concurrence of full and half-blood siblings. Specifically, Article 1006 provides that when they survive together, the full blood shall be entitled to a share double that of the half blood. This provision would be superfluous if full-blood siblings excluded half-blood siblings.

However, since the parties had already entered into a valid contract of Extrajudicial Partition, and there was no ground to annul it, the agreement must be respected. The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the complaint is **DISMISSED**.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Fernando, Capistrano, Teehankee, and Barredo, JJ., concurred).
