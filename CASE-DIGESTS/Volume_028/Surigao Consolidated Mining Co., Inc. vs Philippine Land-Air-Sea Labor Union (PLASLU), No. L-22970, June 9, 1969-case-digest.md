I. CAPTION
SURIGAO CONSOLIDATED MINING COMPANY, INC. and SURICON EMPLOYEES & LABORERS MUTUAL ASSOCIATION (SELMA) v. PHILIPPINE LAND-AIR-SEA LABOR UNION (PLASLU) and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-22970, June 9, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On April 23, 1951, respondent PLASLU filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against petitioner Surigao Consolidated Mining Co. (SURICON), demanding wage increases and other benefits. SURICON and the intervenor union, SELMA, opposed the petition, claiming a valid collective bargaining agreement existed between them. During the hearings in 1953 and 1954, SURICON’s counsel, Atty. Ramirez, manifested in open court that the demands sought by PLASLU were already being enjoyed by the employees. Consequently, PLASLU's counsel moved for judgment in accordance with these manifestations. On March 11, 1954, the CIR issued an order declaring the case "closed and terminated" based on the premise that the disputes were moot since the benefits were purportedly already being granted. PLASLU subsequently filed a motion to examine SURICON’s books to determine the money value of the benefits admitted by counsel. The CIR granted the motion. The examination revealed that the benefits were not actually fully enjoyed, leading the CIR to order SURICON to pay P215,819.55. SURICON appealed, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction and that the March 11 order was a dismissal, not an award.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR had jurisdiction over the case.
2. W/N the statement of SURICON’s counsel in open court constitutes a judicial admission binding on the company.
3. W/N the CIR order of March 11, 1954 was a valid award justifying the monetary computation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The CIR acquired jurisdiction because the petition alleged that a strike was likely to be declared. Moreover, SURICON is barred by **estoppel** from questioning the court's jurisdiction at this stage. The Court held that a party cannot belatedly raise lack of jurisdiction after actively participating in "innumerable hearings" and even taking the controversy to the Supreme Court in a prior instance [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The statement of a counsel made in open court during a hearing in his capacity as counsel of record is deemed to be in the nature of a **judicial admission** made by him on behalf of his client [3]. The Court ruled that the computation of awards was correctly based on the counsel’s manifestation rather than the prior testimony of the company superintendent, as the counsel's statement was subsequent and binding [3].

3. **YES.** While the March 11, 1954 order declared the case "closed," it must be construed in light of PLASLU's motion to render judgment "in accordance with the manifestation and evidence" of SURICON [4, 5]. The Court interpreted this as a judgment on the admissions. The subsequent order to examine the books to determine the money value of the privileges not actually enjoyed was a proper implementation of the March 11 order, which had become final and executory [5, 6].

The appealed order and resolution are AFFIRMED with modification.
