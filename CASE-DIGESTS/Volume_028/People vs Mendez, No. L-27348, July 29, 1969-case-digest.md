I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MIGUEL MENDEZ and SEGUNDO GIANAN, G.R. No. L-27348, July 29, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Appellants Miguel Mendez and Segundo Gianan were accused of slander by deed in the Justice of the Peace Court of Virac, Catanduanes [1]. After numerous postponements and continuances granted to both parties, the prosecution rested its case on January 3, 1963 [1, 2]. The defense requested time to file a memorandum to dismiss the case, which the court granted until January 14, with a warning that failure to do so would result in the case being submitted for decision. The trial was set to resume on January 23, 1963 [3, 4].

On the scheduled date, appellants failed to appear. Their counsel requested another continuance, claiming the accused thought the trial was on January 24 and that Mendez was ill [5]. The court denied the motion, deeming it a dilatory tactic, and declared the case submitted for decision [6]. The court convicted appellants. During the promulgation of judgment on March 15, 1963, Mendez was absent, but the court proceeded [7]. Appellants appealed, alleging abuse of discretion and denial of due process [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for continuance.
2. W/N the accused were denied due process (right to be heard and present evidence).
3. W/N the promulgation of judgment against Mendez was valid despite his absence.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The granting or refusal of an application for continuance lies within the sound discretion of the court pursuant to Section 2, Rule 119 of the Rules of Court [9]. The trial court did not abuse its discretion as it had already granted numerous postponements and had explicitly warned the appellants that further delay would not be tolerated [10, 11]. The excuses offered—confusion regarding the date and unsubstantiated illness—were flimsy and unmasked a scheme to defeat the speedy administration of justice [11, 12].

2. **NO.** The accused effectively waived their right to present evidence [13]. Instead of invoking their right to be heard or filing a motion for reconsideration, they submitted the case without proof on their behalf [14, 15]. To reopen the case would sanction dilatory tactics used to harass the complainant, who is as much entitled to speedy justice as the accused [15].

3. **NO.** Under Section 6, Rule 116 of the old Rules of Court, the defendant must be personally present during the promulgation of judgment if the conviction is for a grave or less grave offense [16]. This requirement is mandatory. Consequently, the sentence against Mendez must be reversed without disturbing the verdict, and the case remanded for proper promulgation [16].

**Judgment affirmed but case remanded to the lower court for the promulgation and reading of the sentence to the accused [17].**
