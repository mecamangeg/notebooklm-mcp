I. CAPTION
CESAR T. ROSALES, ET AL. v. COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25882, July 28, 1969, 28 SCRA 813, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners (the Rosaleses) filed a Civil Case for the nullity of a *pacto de retro* sale and a Land Registration Case regarding certain lots in Quezon Province against respondents (the Escuderos). The trial court tried the cases jointly and rendered decisions in favor of the Rosaleses. The Escuderos filed a Notice of Appeal and Record on Appeal within the reglementary period. However, instead of depositing the appeal bond with the Clerk of Court, they deposited P60.00 with the Provincial Treasurer of Quezon for both cases. The Rosaleses were not served a separate copy of the appeal bond, though the payment was noted in the Record on Appeal. The trial court disapproved the appeals. On certiorari, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the trial court, ordering it to approve the appeals and requiring the Escuderos to post an additional P120.00 bond (later corrected to P60.00). The Rosaleses petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing the appeal was not perfected due to lack of service of the bond, improper venue of deposit, and insufficiency of the amount.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to serve a separate copy of the appeal bond to the adverse party is fatal to the appeal.
2. W/N the deposit of the appeal bond with the Provincial Treasurer constitutes substantial compliance with the Rules of Court.
3. W/N the insufficiency of the bond amount (P60.00 for two cases) warrants the dismissal of the appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the inclusion of the statement in the Record on Appeal regarding the posting of the bond constitutes sufficient compliance with Section 3, Rule 41 of the old Rules of Court. The Rules do not prescribe a specific mode of service; informing the adverse party via the Record on Appeal is adequate to enable them to object to the amount.

2. **YES.** The deposit with the Provincial Treasurer was substantial compliance. Under Section 6 of Republic Act No. 296 (Judiciary Act), appeal bonds are trust funds to be transmitted to the National Treasury. Since the Provincial Treasurer is an authorized representative of the National Treasurer and the deposit was made within the reglementary period and annotated on the records, the defect was not fatal.

3. **NO.** The Court applied the ruling in *Aquino vs. De Guzman* (93 Phil. 824), stating that where two cases are inextricably related and tried jointly, the filing of a single bond may be considered an "excusable oversight." The Escuderos’ failure to file the full P120.00 for the two cases does not bar the appeal, provided the additional amount is paid.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
