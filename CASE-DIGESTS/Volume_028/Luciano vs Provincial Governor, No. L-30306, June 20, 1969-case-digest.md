**I. CAPTION**
**JOSE C. LUCIANO v. THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR, et al., G.R. No. L-30306, June 20, 1969, 28 SCRA 517, Sanchez, J.**

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Jose C. Luciano was the top-elected Councilor of Makati, Rizal in the 1967 elections. Respondents Mayor Maximo Estrella, Vice-Mayor Teotimo Gealogo, and other councilors were also re-elected or elected. On January 18, 1969, an information was filed in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal (Criminal Case No. 18821) charging Mayor Estrella and other officials with violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (R.A. 3019) for a contract entered into during their previous term in 1967.

The Secretary of Justice opined that the Provincial Governor must suspend the accused officials under Section 13 of R.A. 3019. However, the respondents filed civil actions obtaining injunctions from Judges Flores and Mariano to prevent their suspension and removal. Meanwhile, the CFI convicted Estrella et al., but they appealed, and the Court of Appeals issued a restraining order against the execution of the decision. Luciano filed this petition for mandamus and quo warranto to compel the suspension of the respondent officials and to declare himself entitled to the office of Mayor. Subsequently, Luciano was also charged under R.A. 3019 and suspended by the Governor, which Luciano also challenged.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1.  W/N the reelection of a public official bars prosecution for crimes committed during a prior term under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.
2.  W/N suspension under Section 13 of R.A. 3019 is automatic upon the filing of an information.
3.  W/N the power to suspend elective municipal officials under Section 13 of R.A. 3019 lies with the Provincial Governor.
4.  W/N the petitioner is entitled to assume the office of Mayor due to the suspension of the incumbent Mayor and Vice-Mayor.

**IV. RULING**
1.  **NO.** The Court ruled that under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, reelection does not bar prosecution for crimes committed prior thereto. The doctrine in *Pascual v. Provincial Board* and *Lizares v. Hechanova* applies only to *administrative* sanctions, not criminal prosecution under a special statute. To hold otherwise would allow an official to amass wealth through graft and purchase reelection to launder their evil acts [1], [2].

2.  **NO.** While suspension under Section 13 is mandatory ("shall be suspended"), it is not self-operative or automatic. There must first be a determination that the information filed is *valid* before suspension can be effected, requiring someone to exercise the act of suspension [3]-[4].

3.  **NO.** The Court held that the power to suspend under Section 13 of R.A. 3019 resides in the **Court of First Instance** (now Regional Trial Court) where the criminal case is pending, not the Provincial Governor. The validity of the information is a judicial determination, and suspension is an incident to the criminal proceedings. Furthermore, the Decentralization Act of 1967 abrogated the Provincial Governor's power of suspension over local officials, limiting it to administrative cases [5]-[6], [7]. Consequently, the Governor's suspension of petitioner Luciano was also declared void [8].

4.  **YES.** Section 7 of the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. 2264) provides for succession in cases of "temporary incapacity." The Court interpreted "incapacity" to include legal inability, such as suspension from office. Since the Mayor and Vice-Mayor were effectively suspended (and legally incapacitated), the Councilor who obtained the largest number of votes (petitioner Luciano) shall assume the duties of the Mayor [9], [10].

**Disposition:** The petition is GRANTED. Respondent officials are declared suspended; the injunctions issued by the lower courts and Court of Appeals are declared void; and petitioner Jose C. Luciano is declared entitled to sit as Acting Mayor of Makati.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Castro, Fernando, Capistrano, Teehankee, and Barredo concurred with the main opinion.
