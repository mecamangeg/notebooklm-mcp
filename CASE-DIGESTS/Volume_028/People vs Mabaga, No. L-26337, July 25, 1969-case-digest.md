I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SATURNINO MABAGA, AMBROCIO CABILLO and TEOFILO MABAGA**, G.R. No. L-26337, July 25, 1969, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On April 18, 1963, between 9:00 and 9:45 p.m., victims Zoilo Matanguihan, Montano Matanguihan, and Felix Decillo were drinking coffee in the brightly lit kitchen extension of Felix's house in Canlubang, Laguna. Four or five men approached the stairs. Felix recognized his neighbors—appellants Saturnino Mabaga, Teofilo Mabaga, and Ambrocio Cabillo—and invited them to have coffee. Instead of accepting, the group answered with a burst of gunshots and fled while continuing to fire. Montano Matanguihan died shortly after, while Felix Decillo sustained serious neck injuries. Estanislao Decillo, Felix’s brother living nearby, also saw the appellants fleeing the scene armed with guns.

The motive was traced to an incident two weeks prior, where the appellants threatened Felix for refusing to join a petition for land expropriation. The appellants raised the defense of alibi, claiming they were in a meeting in Cabuyao, Laguna at the time. The Court of First Instance of Laguna convicted them of murder and frustrated murder, sentencing them to life imprisonment. They appealed, challenging the sufficiency of evidence and identification.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over the positive identification of the accused.
2. W/N the crimes committed were qualified by treachery and aggravated by evident premeditation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that alibi is the weakest of all defenses and cannot prevail over direct positive evidence of the accused's presence at the crime scene [1]. The prosecution witnesses positively identified the appellants, whom they had known for a long time as neighbors. The scene was well-lit by a kerosene lamp and the moon, making recognition easy [2]. Furthermore, the appellants admitted they knew of no motive for the witnesses to perjure against them. The Court also noted that Canlubang is only a 30-minute drive from Cabuyao, making it possible for the accused to be at the scene [3].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that treachery was present because the victims were shot suddenly while drinking coffee, immediately after extending an invitation to the appellants, which eliminated any possibility of defense [4]. Evident premeditation was also established by the fact that the group arrived armed, fired simultaneously without provocation, and had made specific threats against Felix Decillo two weeks prior [4].

**Disposition:** The decision is **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**. The penalty for the murder of Montano Matanguihan is raised to **DEATH** due to the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation, and the indemnity is increased to P12,000 [5]. The conviction for frustrated murder is sustained.
