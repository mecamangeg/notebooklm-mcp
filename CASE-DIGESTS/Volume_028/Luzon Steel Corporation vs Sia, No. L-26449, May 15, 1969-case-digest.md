I. CAPTION
LUZON STEEL CORPORATION v. JOSE O. SIA and TIMES SURETY & INSURANCE CO. INC., G.R. No. L-26449, May 15, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Luzon Steel Corporation sued Metal Manufacturing of the Philippines and its manager, Jose O. Sia, for breach of contract. A writ of preliminary attachment was issued against the defendants' properties but was lifted upon the filing of a P25,000.00 counterbond by Sia (as principal) and Times Surety & Insurance Co. Inc. (as surety). The bond stipulated that they bound themselves "jointly and severally" to answer for any judgment the plaintiff might recover.

Subsequently, the plaintiff and Sia entered into a compromise agreement without the surety's intervention, whereby Sia agreed to pay the obligation in installments. The trial court approved the compromise and rendered judgment in conformity with it. When Sia failed to comply, Luzon Steel obtained a writ of execution against him and the counterbond. Times Surety moved to quash the writ, arguing it was not a party to the compromise and that the writ was issued without notice and hearing. The trial court quashed the writ and cancelled the counterbond.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the judgment based on a compromise agreement discharged the surety from its obligation under the counterbond.
2. W/N the surety is entitled to the benefit of excussion (previous exhaustion of the debtor’s properties) before execution can issue against the counterbond.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 12, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court, a counterbond is filed to discharge a levy on attachment and stands in place of the property so released. Since the judgment may be enforced against the attached property, it may also be enforced against the counterbond standing in its place, regardless of whether the judgment was obtained after trial on the merits or upon a compromise (Anzures v. Alto Surety & Insurance Co., Inc.). The nature of an attachment counterbond is to secure payment of *any* judgment recovered in the action.

2. **NO.** The surety expressly bound itself "jointly and severally" (in solidum) with the debtor. Under Article 2059, paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, excussion shall not take place if the guarantor has bound himself solidarily with the debtor. Section 17, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court regarding the return of execution unsatisfied cannot amend the substantive law in the Civil Code or nullify the parties' stipulation of solidary liability. Furthermore, under Article 2060 of the Civil Code, a surety claiming excussion must point out sufficient leviable property of the debtor, which Times Surety failed to do. Liability attaches upon the rendition of judgment.

The orders appealed from are **REVERSED**, and the court of origin is ordered to proceed with the execution against the surety.
