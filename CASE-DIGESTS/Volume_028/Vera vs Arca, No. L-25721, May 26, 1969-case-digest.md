I. CAPTION
MISAEL VERA, as Commissioner of Internal Revenue, ET AL. v. HON. JUDGE FRANCISCO ARCA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25721, May 26, 1969, 28 SCRA 351, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Antonio Villegas (Mayor of Manila) and others filed a special civil action in the Court of First Instance, presided by respondent Judge Francisco Arca, to declare the Tax Census Act (R.A. No. 2070) unconstitutional. They alleged the Act violated their rights to liberty, against self-incrimination, and against unreasonable searches and seizures. They sought a preliminary injunction to stop the government (Petitioners Vera, et al.) from enforcing the Act, claiming they faced irreparable injury from potential criminal prosecution. Judge Arca issued the writ of preliminary injunction on February 21, 1966, based solely on legal arguments and without receiving evidence. Petitioners filed this action for certiorari and prohibition, alleging grave abuse of discretion.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge gravely abused his discretion in issuing a writ of preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the Tax Census Act.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the respondent Judge gravely abused his discretion. A legislative act enjoys a presumption of constitutionality which must prevail in the absence of a factual foundation of record to overthrow it. The power to stay an act of Congress is an "awesome responsibility" that calls for the utmost circumspection.

While courts may issue injunctions to protect "preferred freedoms" (such as freedom of expression or religion) without extensive factual evidence, this exception did not apply to the Tax Census Act. By issuing the injunction based purely on pleadings and disregarding the will of the legislative and executive branches, the lower court failed to exercise the caution required in judicial review. An injunction should not be granted while rights are undetermined except in extraordinary cases of material and irreparable injury.

The petition for certiorari was **GRANTED**, setting aside the preliminary injunction. The petition for prohibition was **DENIED**, allowing the lower court to proceed with hearing the case on the merits.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Dizon, J. concurred in the result.
