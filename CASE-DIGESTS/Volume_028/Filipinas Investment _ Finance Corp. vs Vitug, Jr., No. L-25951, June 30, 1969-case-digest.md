I. CAPTION
FILIPINAS INVESTMENT & FINANCE CORPORATION v. JULIAN R. VITUG, JR. and SUPREME SALES & DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-25951, June 30, 1969, Barredo, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant Julian Vitug, Jr. purchased a car from defendant Supreme Sales & Development Corporation (Supreme Sales) for P14,605.00, payable in installments. Vitug executed a promissory note and a chattel mortgage over the car to secure payment [1]. Supreme Sales then negotiated the note and assigned the mortgage to plaintiff Filipinas Investment & Finance Corporation (Filipinas Investment) on a "with-recourse" basis, meaning Supreme Sales would be liable if Vitug failed to pay [2, 3].

When Vitug defaulted, Filipinas Investment foreclosed on the chattel mortgage. The car was sold at public auction, but the proceeds were insufficient, leaving a deficiency of P8,349.35 [1]. Filipinas Investment sued Supreme Sales to recover this deficiency based on the "with-recourse" stipulation. Supreme Sales moved to dismiss, arguing that under Article 1484 of the Civil Code (Recto Law), foreclosure bars any further action to recover an unpaid balance [4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that Filipinas Investment’s choice to foreclose barred deficiency recovery [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the assignee-financing company can recover the deficiency from the assignor-seller after foreclosing on the chattel mortgage, despite the provisions of Article 1484 (Recto Law).

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the "with-recourse" stipulation between the financing company and the seller is valid and does not violate the Recto Law. The transaction was a discounting arrangement where the seller (Supreme Sales) expressly reserved a right of recourse in favor of the assignee (Filipinas Investment) [6, 7].

Article 1484 aims to protect installment *buyers* from unjust enrichment by sellers who foreclose and still seek deficiencies [7, 8]. Here, the remedy is sought not against the buyer (Vitug), but against the seller (Supreme Sales) [7]. Unlike in *Cruz v. Filipinas Investment*, where recovery was barred against a guarantor of the buyer because it would ultimately burden the buyer, enforcing the recourse against the seller here does not affect the buyer’s protection under the Recto Law [9]. Congress did not intend to bar the seller from making commercial use of their credit [10].

The order of dismissal was reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings [11].
