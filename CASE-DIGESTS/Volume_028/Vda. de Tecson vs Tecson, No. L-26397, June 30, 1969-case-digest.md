I. CAPTION
TOMASA BULOS VDA. DE TECSON, as Administratrix of the Testate Estate of Pablo Tecson Ocampo v. VICENTE TECSON, BENJAMIN, RAUL and MIGUEL, all surnamed TECSON, G.R. No. L-26397, June 30, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Pablo Tecson Ocampo (Pablo) was married to Juana Mendoza, with whom he had one son, Vicente Tecson [1]. After Juana died in 1928, the conjugal partnership was not immediately liquidated. Pablo had illicit relations with Tomasa Bulos, whom he later married [2]. In 1929, to liquidate the first conjugal partnership and evade creditors, Pablo and Vicente executed deeds of cession and renunciation [2], [3]. On September 1, 1932, desiring to protect his son and grandchildren (Benjamin, Raul, and Miguel) before marrying Tomasa, Pablo executed an extrajudicial partition of the "San Mariano" property and, on September 27, 1932, donated it to said grandchildren [3], [4]. Pablo married Tomasa in November 1932 [4].

Years later, Pablo sought to recover half of the property for his new family. Failing to secure the donees' consent, he filed an action to annul the donation (Civil Case 8304), which was dismissed [5], [6]. On April 26, 1940, Pablo (later substituted by his administratrix and second wife, Tomasa) filed the present complaint alleging the partition and donation were fictitious and obtained through fraud [7], [8]. The Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija dismissed the complaint, declaring the documents valid and finding the action had prescribed [9]. Tomasa appealed, challenging the lower court's appreciation of the facts [10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the extrajudicial partition and deed of donation are valid.
2. W/N the action to annul the donation on the ground of fraud has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's finding that the extrajudicial partition and deed of donation were valid, free, and voluntary acts of Pablo Tecson Ocampo [9], [10]. The Court applied the principle that a trial court's appraisal of facts and witnesses is entitled to great respect and a presumption of correctness, as the trial judge is in the best position to gauge credibility [11]. The appellate function is exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for the result reached by the trial court [12]. Here, the lower court's exhaustive decision established that the documents were executed to liquidate the first conjugal partnership and provide for Pablo's descendants prior to his second marriage [3], [12].

2. **YES.** The Court upheld the ruling that the action had prescribed. Even assuming the documents were obtained by fraud, the fraud was discovered at the latest on March 3, 1936, when Tomasa obtained a copy of the deed. Under the law then in force, an action to annul a donation based on fraud must be brought within four years. The present action was filed on April 26, 1940, more than four years after the discovery of the alleged fraud [6].

**Decision affirmed.**
