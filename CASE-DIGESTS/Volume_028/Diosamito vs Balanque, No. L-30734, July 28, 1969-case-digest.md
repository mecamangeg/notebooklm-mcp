I. CAPTION
**JUAN DIOSAMITO, ET AL. v. BENJAMIN BALANQUE, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-30734, July 28, 1969, 28 SCRA 836, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On November 12, 1962, in Aringay, La Union, Philippine Constabulary and local police apprehended two trucks loaded with 666 cases of untaxed "blue seal" cigarettes [1]. The trucks were impounded, and the Collector of Customs issued a Warrant of Seizure and Detention on November 19, 1962, instituting Seizure-Forfeiture Proceedings pursuant to the Tariff and Customs Code [1].

On December 7, 1962, while the forfeiture proceedings were pending, the petitioners (claiming to be owners of one of the trucks) filed a suit for damages and replevin in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, Quezon City Branch [2, 3]. The CFI initially ordered the release of the truck upon a bond [3]. The Collector of Customs intervened and moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction [3]. The CFI granted the motion, dismissing the case and recalling the order for the seizure of the property [4]. Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court on the issue of jurisdiction [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to replevin property that is the subject of seizure and forfeiture proceedings by the Bureau of Customs.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court of First Instance has no jurisdiction. The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that on grounds of public policy, the legislature intended to divest the CFI of the prerogative to replevin property subject to seizure and forfeiture proceedings for violation of the Tariff and Customs Code [6].

Citing *Pacis v. Averia* and *De Joya v. David*, the Court held that Section 2303 of the Tariff and Customs Code confers upon the Bureau of Customs the exclusive jurisdiction to determine all questions affecting the disposal of property in seizure cases [6, 7]. Allowing the CFI to exercise jurisdiction would render the Collector's jurisdiction futile and undermine customs laws through the simple device of replevin [8, 9]. The proper recourse for the property owner is not in the CFI but in the Court of Tax Appeals, and only after exhausting administrative remedies in the Bureau of Customs [7].

Furthermore, the Court rejected the petitioners' argument that the truck could not be seized without proof of illegal importation. "Blue seal" cigarettes are *prima facie* presumed to have been imported illegally, and evidence to the contrary must be adduced before the Collector of Customs, not the courts [10].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [11].
