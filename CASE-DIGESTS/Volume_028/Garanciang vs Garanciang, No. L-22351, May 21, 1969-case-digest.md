I. CAPTION
ESTEBAN GARANCIANG and ERMANA BUENAFLOR v. CATALINO GARANCIANG and RUFINA NOCIS, G.R. No. L-22351, May 21, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Esteban Garanciang and Ermana Buenaflor owned several parcels of land. They alleged that on three occasions, through fraud and deceit, defendants Catalino Garanciang (their only son) and Rufina Nocis requested them to sign documents purportedly for a pension application and a passport for their grandson. These documents turned out to be deeds of sale transferring their lands to the defendants. Plaintiffs claimed the deeds were executed without any consideration and that they never intended to sell the properties. Possession was given to defendants merely as a gesture of kindness. Plaintiffs discovered the anomaly on September 10, 1958, and filed a complaint for recovery of possession and annulment of the deeds on July 2, 1963.

The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription, ruling that under Article 1391 of the Civil Code, an action for annulment based on fraud prescribes in four years from the discovery of the fraud. Since the fraud was discovered in 1958 and the case was filed in 1963, the lower court held the action was barred.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action to set aside the deeds of sale has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the action has not prescribed. While the complaint alleged fraud, it also specifically alleged the **total absence of cause or consideration**. Under Articles 1352 and 1409(3) of the Civil Code, the total absence of cause or consideration renders a contract not merely voidable, but **absolutely void and inexistent**. The Court noted that based on the allegations, the sales were "worse than fictitious" because the plaintiffs had absolutely no intention of executing them.

Under Article 1410 of the Civil Code, the action or defense for the declaration of the inexistence of a contract does not prescribe. Consequently, the four-year prescriptive period for voidable contracts under Article 1391 does not apply. The Order appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **REMANDED** to the court of origin for further proceedings.
