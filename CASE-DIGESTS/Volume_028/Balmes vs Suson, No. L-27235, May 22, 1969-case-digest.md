I. CAPTION
BONIFACIO BALMES v. FORTUNATO SUSON, G.R. No. L-27235, May 22, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Bonifacio Balmes and Fortunato Suson were claimants for a public land designated as Lot 2104 in Zamboanga del Sur. The Director of Lands decided in favor of Balmes in 1941. Suson, who was in possession of the land, filed multiple motions for reconsideration and appeals, delaying the execution for years. The Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources finally affirmed the decision in favor of Balmes in 1955.

Unable to secure execution administratively, Balmes filed a case for recovery of possession and damages (Civil Case 356) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zamboanga del Sur in 1957. Suson moved to dismiss, arguing lack of jurisdiction and prematurity because he had filed a petition for executive review with the Office of the President. The CFI denied the motion. Suson then filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-12868) questioning the CFI's jurisdiction. The Supreme Court dismissed Suson's petition via a minute resolution in 1957.

The CFI proceeded with the trial and rendered judgment ordering Suson to vacate the premises and pay P3,000 in damages and P500 in attorney's fees. Suson appealed, resurrecting the jurisdictional issue regarding the pending executive review and challenging the award of damages which were not specifically prayed for in the complaint.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court had jurisdiction over the case despite the pendency of the petition for executive review.
2. W/N the award of damages and attorney's fees was proper despite the lack of specific allegations in the complaint.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the jurisdictional issue had already been settled. The Supreme Court's previous dismissal of Suson's certiorari petition (G.R. No. L-12868) via minute resolution constituted the "law of the case." Under the doctrine of the law of the case, whatever is irrevocably established as the controlling legal rule between the same parties in the same case continues to be the law of the case, whether correct on general principles or not (*People v. Olarte*). The maxim applicable is *non quieta movere*. Furthermore, the Office of the President had already dismissed the executive appeal in 1964, rendering the argument moot.

2. **YES.** While the complaint did not specifically allege the P3,000 litigation expenses, the plaintiff presented evidence of these expenses during the trial without objection from the defendant. Under the Rules of Court and jurisprudence (*Marella v. Reyes*), if evidence is adduced during trial without objection, the objection is deemed waived, and the defect in the pleadings is cured. Regarding attorney's fees, the award is within the ambit of Article 2208(11) of the Civil Code, which allows recovery when the court deems it just and equitable. Considering the defendant's pattern of delay and bad faith, fees were justified.

**Disposition:** Judgment affirmed with modification. The defendant is ordered to pay P1,500 as attorney's fees and treble costs for filing a frivolous appeal.
