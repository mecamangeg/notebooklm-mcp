I. CAPTION
TOMAS SABANGAN (Minor), represented by his mother RAMONA APULI v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM, NATIONAL TREASURER OF THE PHILIPPINES, ENRIQUE SABANGAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-29839, July 17, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Tomas Sabangan, a minor represented by his mother Ramona Apuli, filed a complaint against Manila Railroad Company (MRR), GSIS, and others. He claimed to be the son of the deceased Perfecto Sabangan, a former MRR employee, and sought various monetary benefits (differential pay, backpay, overtime, allowances, bonuses, and gratuity) allegedly due to his father [1]. He also challenged the successional rights of the other defendants (Enrique, Norma, and Maria Sabangan) to these benefits [1].

MRR filed a motion to dismiss. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila dismissed the complaint [1, 2]. The plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied by the trial court on the merits of the motion for dismissal, notwithstanding the plaintiff's claim that his opposition to the motion was delayed in the mail [3]. The trial court's order of dismissal was predicated on the insufficiency of the complaint [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a cause of action was proper given its deficiency in details.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal. While the Court conceded that the complaint was "very unskillfully drafted" and deficient in details regarding the factual basis of the items claimed, it found that the complaint sufficiently asserted rights against the defendants and alleged that demands for such rights had not been complied with [5].

The Court ruled that a deficiency in details does not amount to a failure to state a cause of action. The proper remedy for such ambiguity or lack of detail is not dismissal, but a **motion for a bill of particulars** to enable the defendants to properly frame their responsive pleadings [5]. Furthermore, regarding the specific ground of the dismissal, the Court found the complaint contained a sufficient averment of the plaintiff's authority to pursue the claim—specifically, that he is the son of the deceased and entitled to successional rights [4].

The Order appealed from was SET ASIDE, and the case was REMANDED to the court of origin for further proceedings [4].
