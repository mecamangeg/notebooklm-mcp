I. CAPTION
ADELA ONGSIACO VDA. DE CLEMEÑA, ET AL. v. AGUSTIN ENGRACIO CLEMEÑA and HON. JUDGE PEDRO C. NAVARRO, G.R. No. L-24739, May 22, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Agustin Engracio Clemeña filed a civil case against Petitioners (the widow and legitimate children of the deceased Engracio Clemeña) in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, seeking partition, inventory, and accounting of the deceased's estate on the claim that he was an illegitimate child. Petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that a Special Proceeding for the settlement of the estate was already pending in the Court of First Instance of Manila, which had exclusive jurisdiction. Respondent Judge Navarro denied the motion. Petitioners filed a special civil action for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court. During the pendency of this case, the Supreme Court rendered a decision in a related case involving the same parties (*Vda. de Clemeña v. Clemeña*, G.R. No. L-24845).

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to dismiss the civil case filed by the private respondent.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court granted the writs of certiorari and prohibition, setting aside the respondent Judge's order. The Court relied on its decision in the related case of *Vda. de Clemeña v. Clemeña* (G.R. No. L-24845), which held that an action by an alleged illegitimate child (not natural) to secure a judicial investigation of paternity is subject to the time limits prescribed by **Article 285 of the Civil Code**. Since the respondent was already over 21 years of age at the time of the alleged parent's death, he was barred from instituting the action to establish his filiation. Having been judicially declared "without legal interest in the estate" in the previous ruling, his pending action for partition and accounting in the respondent Judge's court served no useful purpose. Therefore, the refusal to dismiss the case was devoid of support in law and constituted grave abuse of discretion. The petition was **GRANTED**.
