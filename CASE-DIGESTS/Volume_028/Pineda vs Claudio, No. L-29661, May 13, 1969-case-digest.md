I. CAPTION
BASILIO M. PINEDA v. JOVITO O. CLAUDIO, et al., G.R. No. L-29661, May 13, 1969, 28 SCRA 34, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Upon the death of the Pasay City Chief of Police in 1968, respondent Mayor Claudio appointed respondent Francisco Villa, a state prosecutor, to the vacancy. Respondent Civil Service Commissioner Subido held the appointment in abeyance, contending that under Section 23 of the Civil Service Act (R.A. 2260) and the ruling in *Millares v. Subido*, petitioner Pineda (the incumbent Deputy Chief) had a preferential right to the position as the "next-in-rank" employee. Subido argued that vacancies must be filled strictly in the following order: promotion, transfer, reinstatement, reemployment, and lastly, certification. Mayor Claudio refused to appoint Pineda, citing his discretion under the Police Act of 1966 and the Decentralization Act (R.A. 5185). Pineda filed a petition for Mandamus to compel his appointment.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Mayor is mandatorily required to promote the next-in-rank employee to the vacant Chief of Police position before considering other modes of appointment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that Section 23 of the Civil Service Act does not peremptorily require that vacancies be filled by promotion, transfer, reinstatement, reemployment, or certification *in that specific order*. The "next-in-rank" rule and the corollary requirement to state "special reasons" for bypassing a senior employee apply **only** to cases where the appointing authority chooses to fill the vacancy by **promotion**. If the appointing power chooses to fill the vacancy by other methods—such as transfer or certification (as in this case, where Villa was appointed from a certified list)—the next-in-rank rule does not apply, and the appointing authority is under no duty to explain why the ranking employee was not chosen. To construe the law otherwise would unduly interfere with the prerogatives of the local executive and substitute the Civil Service Commissioner's judgment for that of the appointing authority. As Villa was certified qualified and eligible, his appointment was valid. The petition for mandamus was **denied**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
*   **Fernando, J. (Concurring):** Emphasized that public office is a public trust; constitutional construction should favor the demands of public service and efficiency over the individual security of tenure.
*   **Dizon, J. (Dissenting):** The strict order of priority laid out in *Millares* should be maintained to prevent capricious acts by appointing powers and to protect the reasonable expectations of career officials.
*   **Zaldivar, J. (Dissenting):** Adherence to the strict next-in-rank rule is more conducive to maintaining high morale among officers and employees in the civil service.
