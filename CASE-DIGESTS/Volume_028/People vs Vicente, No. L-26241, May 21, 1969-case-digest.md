**I. CAPTION**
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JOSE VICENTE, ERNESTO ESCORPIZO, ALFREDO BEDONIO and AMBROCIO CABILES, JR.**, G.R. No. L-26241, May 21, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., Acting C.J.

**II. FACTS**
On the evening of October 29, 1965, in Asingan, Pangasinan, Jaime Soriano was at the public market when accused Jose Vicente approached him and asked if he was with "Boy Cañaveral" when the latter allegedly shot Vicente's brother. Despite Soriano's denial, Vicente suddenly stabbed him multiple times with a dagger/bayonet. After Soriano fell to the ground, accused Ernesto Escorpizo stabbed him with a small knife. Witnesses alleged that accused Alfredo Bedonio and Ambrocio Cabiles, Jr. then threw stones at the prostrate victim and the witnesses. The accused raised the defense of alibi and claimed their extrajudicial confessions were coerced. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan convicted all four accused of Murder attended by treachery and sentenced them to life imprisonment.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the defense of alibi prevails over the positive identification by the eyewitness.
2. W/N accused Escorpizo, Bedonio, and Cabiles are liable as co-conspirators in the crime of Murder.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The factual findings of the trial judge regarding witness credibility are not disturbed absent proof of misappreciation of evidence. The positive identification by eyewitness Sarmiento, who had no motive to testify falsely, prevails over the accused's alibi, which is the weakest of defenses. The witness's alleged denial of knowledge of the assailants' identity during the wake does not detract from his positive identification before the police and in court, as such denial may have been caused by fear of retaliation [1], [2], [3].

2. **NO.** Conspiracy must be shown by direct or circumstantial evidence as clearly and convincingly as the commission of the offense itself; neither joint nor simultaneous action is *per se* sufficient indicium of conspiracy unless motivated by a common design [4].

*   **Jose Vicente:** **Guilty** of Murder. He inflicted the first and fatal injuries. The attack was treacherous due to the suddenness and the seriousness of injuries inflicted on an unarmed victim who was not in a position to defend himself [5].
*   **Ernesto Escorpizo:** **Guilty** only as an **Accomplice**. There was no proof of a common design. He stabbed the victim only after the latter had already fallen; this act was merely a "show-off" or expression of camaraderie and was not indispensable to the consummation of the crime [6].
*   **Alfredo Bedonio and Ambrocio Cabiles, Jr.:** **Acquitted**. There was a "dearth of evidence" regarding their specific roles. Mere throwing of stones, which was doubtful, or presence at the scene is insufficient to prove conspiracy [7], [8].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision is **AFFIRMED** as to Jose Vicente (Life Imprisonment); **MODIFIED** as to Ernesto Escorpizo, who is sentenced to 10 years and 1 day of *prisión mayor* to 17 years and 4 months of *reclusión temporal* as an accomplice; and **REVERSED** as to Alfredo Bedonio and Ambrocio Cabiles, Jr., who are **ACQUITTED** on reasonable doubt. Vicente and Escorpizo are ordered to indemnify the heirs P12,000 [8].
