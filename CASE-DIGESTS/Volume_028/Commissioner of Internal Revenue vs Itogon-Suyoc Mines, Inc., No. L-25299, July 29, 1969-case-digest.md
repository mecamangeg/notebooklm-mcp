**I. CAPTION**
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. ITOGON-SUYOC MINES, INC. and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-25299, July 29, 1969, Fernando, J.

**II. FACTS**
On January 13, 1961, respondent Itogon-Suyoc Mines, Inc. filed its income tax return for the fiscal year 1959-1960 and paid P13,155.20 as the first installment. Later, it filed an amended return reporting a net loss and sought a refund of the amount paid. For the succeeding fiscal year 1960-1961, the respondent filed its return and deducted the P13,155.20 (representing the refund claim) from its new tax liability [1, 2].

Petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed respondent P1,512.83 as 1% monthly interest on the deducted amount, arguing that the respondent had no right to deduct the sum before the refund was officially approved [2]. The respondent contested the assessment before the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), which ruled in its favor, declaring it unfair to exact interest on money already in the government's possession. The CIR appealed to the Supreme Court [3-5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the respondent corporation is liable for delinquency interest on the tax amount it deducted representing a pending refund claim.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals.

The Court held that the imposition of interest was not supported by law. While Section 51(d) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) imposes interest on deficiencies, Section 51(a) of the same Code allows a taxpayer to deduct a refund due from a preceding year from the tax to be paid [6, 7]. It was an admitted fact that the respondent was entitled to the refund due to the prior overpayment [7].

Furthermore, relying on the doctrine in *Castro v. Collector of Internal Revenue* (6 SCRA 886), the Court explained that interest is not a penalty but "just compensation to the State for the delay in paying the tax, and for the concomitant use by the taxpayer of funds that rightfully should be in the government's hands" [8, 9]. Since the P13,155.20 was already in the government treasury due to the overpayment in the previous year, there was no delay and the taxpayer did not utilize public funds [10]. It would be unfair and unjust to require the taxpayer to pay interest on an amount the government already held [5, 11].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [10].
