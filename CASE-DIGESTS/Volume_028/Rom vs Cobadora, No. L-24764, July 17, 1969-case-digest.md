I. CAPTION
EUFROSINO ROM v. CLEMENTE COBADORA, G.R. No. L-24764, July 17, 1969, Teehankee, J.

II. FACTS
Appellant Clemente Cobadora and Appellee Eufrosino Rom disputed the possession and ownership of a 10-hectare parcel of land. Cobadora previously filed a case for forcible entry against Rom and obtained a favorable judgment restoring him to possession. Subsequently, Rom filed a civil case for quieting of title over the same land. The trial court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, declared Rom the lawful owner. After this judgment became final, a writ of execution was issued. The Sheriff placed Rom in possession, but Cobadora refused to vacate a portion of the land where his house was located. Rom charged Cobadora with contempt of court. The trial court found Cobadora guilty of contempt for disobedience to a lawful writ. Cobadora appealed, arguing that the prior forcible entry judgment constituted *res judicata*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the judgment in the forcible entry case constitutes *res judicata* to the subsequent action for quieting of title.
2. W/N the appellant is liable for contempt for refusing to vacate the premises and remove his house.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A judgment in a forcible entry case involves only the right of possession and does not constitute *res judicata* as to a subsequent action to quiet title and settle the issue of ownership over the land involved in the litigation [1], [2]. The issue of ownership, when not essential to the question of possession, is properly threshed out in an action to quiet title.

2. **NO.** The writ of execution is addressed solely to the sheriff, who is called upon to oust the defeated party and place the prevailing party in possession. Mere refusal or unwillingness by the defeated party to relinquish the property does not constitute contempt under Rule 71, Section 3(b), which punishes disobedience to orders addressed directly to a defendant [1], [3]. Furthermore, under Rule 39, Section 14, the appellant's house could not be removed pending the appellee's recourse to the Court for a special order of demolition. This order issues only "upon petition of the judgment creditor after due hearing, and after the former has failed to remove the same within a reasonable time fixed by the Court" [3]. The proper recourse was to apply for this special order, not a contempt charge.

The judgment of contempt is REVERSED.
