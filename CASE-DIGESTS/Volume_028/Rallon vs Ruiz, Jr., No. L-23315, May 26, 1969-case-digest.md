I. CAPTION
DESIDERIO S. RALLON v. PACIFICO RUIZ, JR., EUFEMIO RUIZ, ANTONIO GERAGA, TIMOTEO BULILIS, G.R. No. L-23315 (with connected cases L-23316, L-23317, L-23318), May 26, 1969, 28 SCRA 332, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs (Desiderio Rallon et al.) filed four possessory actions in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bohol to recover possession of portions of Lot 46, a public land released from the forest zone in 1952. Plaintiffs claimed rights derived from their aunts, who were former timber licensees and permittees. Defendants (Pacifico Ruiz, Jr. et al.) were actual occupants who had filed free patent applications with the Bureau of Lands in 1952. Plaintiffs subsequently filed sales applications and protested defendants' free patents.

While the administrative investigation was pending, plaintiffs filed the court actions in 1955 to "facilitate adjudication." The CFI dismissed the complaints, ruling it lacked jurisdiction as the Director of Lands had already taken action on the controversy. Meanwhile, in the administrative proceedings, the Director of Lands dismissed plaintiffs' claims for failure to prosecute and gave due course to defendants' applications. This administrative decision was affirmed by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources and became final after plaintiffs failed to file a timely motion for reconsideration or appeal to the President. A subsequent Court of Appeals decision also declared the administrative proceedings valid and final. Plaintiffs appealed the CFI's dismissal of their possessory actions to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N courts have jurisdiction over possessory actions involving public lands subject to administrative investigation.
2. W/N the possessory actions should be dismissed given the finality of the administrative decision.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Courts retain jurisdiction over possessory actions involving public lands to determine the issue of physical possession (in forcible entry) or the better right of possession (in *accion publiciana*), independent of the administrative question of disposition or alienation. The Court cited *Pitargue v. Sorilla*, holding that the authority of the Lands Department to dispose of public lands does not deprive courts of their function to prevent breaches of the peace by adjudicating possessory conflicts. The lower court therefore erred in disclaiming jurisdiction solely because the Director of Lands has executive control over public lands.

2. **YES.** While the lower court technically had jurisdiction, the plaintiffs' cause must fail because the actions have been rendered **moot and academic** by the prior final decisions of the Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture. The administrative branch has already spoken and confirmed defendants' possession for purposes of free patents. Under the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, the finality of the administrative decision is fatal to the court review (*Calo v. Fuertes*). Since the plaintiffs' claim of possession was resolved adversely by the Lands Department, and they failed to appeal to the Office of the President, they have "ceased to be entitled to the relief" sought in court (*De los Santos v. Rodriguez*).

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
