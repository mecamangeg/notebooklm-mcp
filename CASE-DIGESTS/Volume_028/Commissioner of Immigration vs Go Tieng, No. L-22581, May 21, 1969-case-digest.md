I. CAPTION
THE COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION v. JUAN GO TIENG and SZE SAU CHIEN, et al., G.R. No. L-22581, May 21, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Juan Go Tieng obtained an Identification Certificate as a Filipino citizen by representing himself as the natural child of a Filipino mother using a falsified birth certificate. Based on his alleged citizenship, his wife, Sze Sau Chien, also secured recognition as a Filipino citizen, and their minor children sought admission into the country.

Upon discovering the falsification, the Petitioner Commissioner of Immigration revoked the orders declaring them Filipinos, cancelled their identification certificates, and instituted deportation proceedings against Juan Go Tieng. Sze Sau Chien and the children were also ordered to leave the country. Instead of facing the deportation proceedings, Respondents filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) to enjoin the Commissioner from deporting them and to declare them Filipino citizens.

The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the evidence of Juan Go Tieng's citizenship was incomplete. The Court of Appeals (CA), however, vacated the CFI decision and remanded the case for further proceedings to determine Go Tieng's citizenship. The Commissioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N prohibition and mandamus are proper remedies to stop deportation proceedings and secure a judicial declaration of citizenship.
2. W/N the marriage of an alien woman to a Filipino citizen automatically confers citizenship upon her and their minor children.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The suit for prohibition and mandamus was premature. The Philippine Immigration Act of 1940 (Sec. 37(a) in relation to Sec. 45) grants the Commissioner of Immigration the authority to institute deportation proceedings and pass upon the question of citizenship in the first instance. Judicial review is only available after the administrative body has rendered a decision. The Court held that "orderly procedure requires that the matter be threshed out where the law assigns it in the first place," and the courts cannot preempt the administrative authority before a hearing is conducted.

2. **NO.** The Court reiterated the settled doctrine that the fact of marriage alone by an alien to a Filipino does not automatically make the alien wife a Filipino citizen. Citizenship must be determined in an appropriate proceeding by a showing that the alien wife "might herself be naturalized" as a Filipino citizen (Section 15, Commonwealth Act No. 473). The same rule applies to their minor children. Consequently, the order for the wife and children to depart was not an abuse of discretion.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED**, and the decision of the Court of First Instance dismissing the petition is **AFFIRMED**.
