I. CAPTION
SUSANA GALA DE ENRIQUEZ, ET AL. v. EL HOGAR FILIPINO, G.R. No. L-23215, June 9, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellees owned 158 fully paid preferred shares (par value P200.00 each) of defendant-appellant El Hogar Filipino, a mutual building and loan association. These shares earned a fixed annual dividend of 7%. Due to World War II, El Hogar suspended operations and was only authorized to reopen on July 1, 1952, by the Superintendent of Banks. A condition for reopening was the recognition of a 27.79% impairment on its capital to cover war-time losses. Consequently, when appellees applied to retire their shares in 1954, El Hogar paid the surrender value but deducted P8,781.69, representing the 27.79% impairment.

Appellees filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila for the recovery of the deducted amount. The CFI rendered judgment ordering El Hogar to pay the P8,781.69 deducted and dividends at 4%. El Hogar appealed, arguing the impairment was valid based on the conditions imposed by the Central Bank and accepted by its Board of Directors. Appellees did not appeal the reduction of dividends from 7% to 4%.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a mutual building and loan association may validly deduct a percentage from the value of preferred paid-up shares to cover losses incurred during the war.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the deduction of 27.79% from the value of appellees' preferred shares was without authority in law [1].

The Court ruled that the issuance of paid-up shares by building and loan associations is merely a borrowing of money; thus, the holders of such shares are creditors rather than stockholders (*Yatco v. El Hogar Filipino*, 67 Phil. 621) [2]. Unlike common shares, preferred paid-up shares do not participate in profits or accretions of the association beyond the fixed dividend, and therefore should not share in the losses [3, 4]. The acceptance by the association's officers of the Central Bank's condition to reduce paid-in capital could not affect the appellees, as the officers had no authority to represent creditors in accepting such conditions [5]. Furthermore, a debtor's obligation to pay its debt in full is not dependent on its operations unless subjected to insolvency proceedings [1].

The petition was denied, and the judgment of the lower court was affirmed [6].
