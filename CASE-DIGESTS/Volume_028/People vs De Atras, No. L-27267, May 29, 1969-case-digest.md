I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DIOSDADO DE ATRAS, et al. and HON. JORGE R. COQUIA, G.R. No. L-27267, May 29, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On June 1, 1966, an information for murder was filed against Diosdado de Atras, Rodolfo Bernardo, and several others in the Court of First Instance of Occidental Mindoro [1, 2]. During the trial, the prosecution filed a motion to discharge accused Rodolfo Bernardo to utilize him as a state witness, arguing his testimony was absolutely necessary to prove conspiracy [3]. The respondent Judge held the ruling in abeyance to evaluate the prosecution's evidence [3]. Subsequently, the prosecution presented Guillerma Ortiz Vda. de Cruz, the victim's widow, who identified De Atras as the triggerman and others as accomplices [4]. Following this testimony, the respondent Judge denied the motion to discharge Bernardo, ruling that since other witnesses had already identified the defendants, Bernardo's testimony was not absolutely necessary as required by the Rules of Court [5, 6]. The People filed a petition for certiorari to challenge this denial [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the discharge of accused Rodolfo Bernardo to be a state witness is proper.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming that the discharge of a defendant to be used as a prosecution witness is only available if there is an **absolute necessity** for their testimony, or if the accused is the only one with knowledge of the crime [6]. It does not apply when the testimony would merely corroborate or strengthen existing evidence [6].

In this case, three prosecution witnesses (Omus, Tambagahan, and Vda. de Cruz) had already testified, claiming they saw the shooting and identifying the defendants [7]. Therefore, the Court found no absolute necessity for Bernardo's testimony to prove the commission of the offense or the conspiracy [7]. The petition was dismissed and the writ denied [7].
