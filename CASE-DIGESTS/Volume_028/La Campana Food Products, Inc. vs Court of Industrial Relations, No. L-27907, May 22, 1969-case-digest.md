I. CAPTION
LA CAMPANA FOOD PRODUCTS, INC. AND LA CAMPANA CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, INC. EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, LA CAMPANA FOOD PRODUCTS, INC., LA CAMPANA CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, INC. and RICARDO TANTONGCO, G.R. No. L-27907, May 22, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Union filed an unfair labor practice (ULP) case (CIR Case 3985-ULP) against private respondents (La Campana Food Products, Inc., et al.). The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) rendered a judgment finding respondents guilty of ULP and ordering the reinstatement of 21 union members with backwages [1]. Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-25903), but the petition was denied for lack of merit, and the judgment became final and executory on August 22, 1966 [2, 3].

However, respondents filed a motion for new trial in the CIR alleging newly discovered evidence (recantation affidavits of union witnesses) and excusable negligence (failure of their counsel to appear and cross-examine witnesses) [3, 4]. The CIR *en banc* issued a resolution on April 6, 1967, directing the reopening of the case [5]. Petitioner Union filed this petition for certiorari to annul the reopening. During the pendency of this case, the Union’s new counsel filed a motion to dismiss the petition, claiming the Union leadership had lost interest, which was opposed by the former counsel on behalf of the 21 affected members [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR may reopen a ULP case after the judgment has become final and executory upon dismissal of the appeal by the Supreme Court.
2. W/N the petition should be dismissed based on the Union's motion to withdraw due to loss of interest.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The CIR acts in excess of its jurisdiction when it reopens a case after the judgment has become final and executory if the grounds relied upon were already directly or impliedly litigated or were available to the parties during the former proceedings. While Section 17 of Commonwealth Act No. 103 allows the CIR to modify or reopen an award, this power is limited to grounds coming into existence *after* the decision was rendered (supervening events), such as changes in the employer's financial situation [8, 9]. The respondents' failure to cross-examine witnesses or present evidence was due to their own default and negligence, not a denial of due process [10, 11]. Furthermore, recantations by witnesses are reliable and do not constitute new evidence sufficient to disturb a final judgment protected by *res judicata* [12]. To allow reopening on these grounds would make litigation "an endless affair" [13].

2. **NO.** The Court denied the motion to dismiss. The withdrawal of an appeal after the case has been submitted for decision is not a matter of right but lies within the Court's discretion under Rule 50, Section 4 of the Rules of Court [14]. The Court ruled that dismissing the case would prejudice the 21 individual union members who stand to recover reinstatement and backwages, noting that the Union leadership's "loss of interest" should not defeat the vested rights of the workers [7, 15].

**Petition granted.** The CIR *en banc* resolution is set aside and declared null and void [16].
