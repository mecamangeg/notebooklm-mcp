I. CAPTION
PABLO BASBAS v. RUFINO ENTENA, FLAVIANO TIBAY and ANGELINA ENTENA, and R. M. RESURRECCION, G.R. No. L-26255, June 30, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Pablo Basbas was the leasehold tenant of a riceland parcel in Sta. Rosa, Laguna, owned by defendant Rufino Entena [1]. On April 11, 1964, Entena sold the land to his co-defendants, Spouses Flaviano Tibay and Angelina Entena [2]. Subsequently, on May 25, 1964, Entena sent a letter to Basbas offering to sell the land at P13,000.00 per hectare [3]. Basbas replied on June 4, 1964, accepting the offer to sell but disagreeing with the price, stating he was enlisting government aid to purchase the land [3]. He also sought assistance from the Land Authority, which informed him the matter was being processed [3].

Basbas filed an action in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) to exercise his right of redemption under Sections 11 and 12 of the Agricultural Land Reform Code (R.A. 3844) [4]. However, Basbas admitted that he had not deposited any sum of money with the court to cover the pre-emption or redemption price [3]. The CAR dismissed the case, ruling that the failure to tender payment or consign the purchase price was fatal to his cause of action [4]. Basbas appealed, arguing that the law does not require tender and that he is only required to pay a "reasonable price" [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N tender of payment and judicial consignation of the purchase price are necessary to exercise the tenant-lessee's right of pre-emption or redemption under the Agricultural Land Reform Code.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. The Court held that the timely exercise of the right of legal redemption requires either a valid tender of the price or its valid consignation in court [6]. Citing *Torres de Conejero v. Court of Appeals*, the Court explained that tender is indispensable to demonstrate that the offer to redeem is made seriously and in good faith, preventing harassment by speculators [7].

The Court ruled that the provision in Section 12 of R.A. 3844 (and Article 1620 of the Civil Code) allowing redemption at a "reasonable price" does not excuse the redemptioner from the duty to make a proper tender of the price he honestly deems reasonable [8]. Without this requirement, the statutory redemption period (two years) would be rendered meaningless and indefinite, depressing the land's market value and paralyzing the landowner's ability to realize its value [9]. Furthermore, the establishment of the Land Bank to finance such acquisitions does not suspend the running of the redemption period until the tenant obtains financing [10, 11].

Order affirmed [11].
