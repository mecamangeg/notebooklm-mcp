I. CAPTION
SILVESTRE MASA v. HON. JUAN A. BAES, Judge of the Court of Agrarian Relations, and JOSE TAN KAPOE, G.R. No. L-29784, May 21, 1969, 28 SCRA 619, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In 1963, the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR), presided by Judge De Guzman, rendered a decision authorizing Respondent Tan Kapoe (landholder) to eject Petitioner Masa (tenant). Masa filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) by registered mail but failed to attach the proof of service required by the CAR Rules. Judge Macalino (De Guzman’s successor) ordered a copy furnished to Tan Kapoe, who did not object to the lack of proof of service. In 1964, Judge Macalino granted the MR, setting aside the 1963 decision and maintaining Masa in peaceful possession. Tan Kapoe filed a notice of appeal but failed to prosecute it, allowing the 1964 resolution to lapse.

Four years later, in 1968, after Masa requested a supplemental decision on rentals, Tan Kapoe moved to reconsider the 1964 resolution. He argued that Masa’s original 1963 MR was defective for lack of proof of service, meaning it did not interrupt the period for appeal, rendering the 1963 ejectment decision final and executory. Respondent Judge Baes granted Tan Kapoe’s motion and ordered the execution of the 1963 decision. Masa filed a petition for certiorari.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the failure to attach proof of service to the Motion for Reconsideration rendered it ineffective, causing the original decision to become final.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that while Section 1 of Rule 17 of the Rules of the Court of Agrarian Relations requires proof of service, the defect is cured if it is shown that the adverse party actually received the motion. Record showed Tan Kapoe’s counsel received the copy by registered mail. Furthermore, Tan Kapoe was in **estoppel** for failing to raise the defect for nearly four years, receiving the copy without protest, and failing to perfect his appeal against the 1964 revocatory resolution.

The Court emphasized that under **Section 155 of the Land Reform Act (Republic Act No. 3844)**, the CAR is not bound strictly by technical rules of evidence and procedure. Since the 1964 decision by Judge Macalino was not appealed, it became the **law of the case** and could not be set aside by Respondent Judge Baes.

The petition was **GRANTED**, the orders of Judge Baes were annulled and set aside, and the case was remanded with instructions to restore Masa’s possession.
