I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF YU CHUAN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, YU CHUAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-26706, June 30, 1969, 28 SCRA 896, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Yu Chuan filed a petition for naturalization, which the Republic of the Philippines opposed. The Republic argued that the petitioner failed to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during his residence in the Philippines because he was administratively fined seven times by the Bureau of Immigration for the late registration of his seven minor children, in violation of the Alien Registration Act [1, 2].

The lower court granted the petition on July 7, 1966, accepting Yu Chuan’s explanation that his children were sickly at birth. The trial judge relied on the 1957 doctrine in *Chay Guan Tan v. Republic*, which held that such omissions were not sufficient to disqualify an applicant [2]. The Republic appealed the decision to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner despite his failure to timely register his minor children.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s decision. The Court held that the failure of the petitioner to register his minor children within the first sixty days of every calendar year constitutes a clear violation of the Alien Registration Act (Republic Act No. 562, Section 10). This violation renders the applicant’s conduct far from proper and irreproachable in his relation with the government [3-5].

The Court clarified that the *Chay Guan Tan* doctrine relied upon by the lower court had already been abandoned by subsequent jurisprudence, specifically *Co v. Republic* (1960), *Chung Hong v. Republic* (1962), and *Lim Guan v. Republic* (1966) [5]. The Court emphasized that the privilege of Filipino citizenship is reserved only for the deserving. If an applicant has already manifested a "far-from-commendable tendency" prior to naturalization, there is no assurance that he would behave less objectionably if admitted as a citizen [6, 7].

WHEREFORE, the lower court decision of July 7, 1966 granting the petition for naturalization of Yu Chuan is reversed. With costs against petitioner Yu Chuan [7].
