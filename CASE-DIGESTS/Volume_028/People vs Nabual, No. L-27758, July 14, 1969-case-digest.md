I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DEMETRIO NABUAL, LUIS NABUAL, and ELPIDIO BACHICHA, G.R. No. L-27758, July 14, 1969, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On January 7, 1967, in Calbiga, Samar, accused Luis Nabual and Elpidio Bachicha (along with Demetrio Nabual, who died pending appeal), armed with guns and a knife, entered the house of spouses Carlota and Pablo Ocenada. They demanded money from Carlota, obtaining P535.00, and stabbed Pablo multiple times, causing his death. The accused were charged with robbery with homicide. The Information alleged several aggravating circumstances: nighttime, dwelling, reiteration (previous murder convictions for the Nabuals), evident premeditation, and abuse of superior strength. Upon arraignment, the accused pleaded guilty. The Court of First Instance of Samar convicted them and, finding the plea of guilty insufficient to offset the five aggravating circumstances, sentenced them to death. Counsel *de officio* appealed, arguing that reiteration, nighttime, and evident premeditation were not present, and that the plea of guilty should offset the remaining circumstances of dwelling and superior strength to reduce the penalty to life imprisonment.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N evident premeditation is an aggravating circumstance in the crime of robbery with homicide.
2. W/N the mitigating circumstance of a plea of guilty is sufficient to offset the aggravating circumstances present.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While evident premeditation is generally inherent in robbery (as it entails agreement and reflection), it is considered an aggravating circumstance in **robbery with homicide** if there is evident premeditation **to kill** besides stealing. Citing *People v. Valeriano*, the Court held that the accused had a distinct plan to kill, as admitted by their plea to the Information which alleged they entered "with intent to kill" and provided themselves with a knife "for the purpose" of the killing [1], [2].

2. **NO.** Even disregarding the contested circumstances of nighttime and reiteration, three aggravating circumstances remained established: evident premeditation, dwelling, and abuse of superior strength [3]. A single mitigating circumstance of a plea of guilty cannot offset these three aggravating circumstances. The Court noted that the plea appeared to be a strategic attempt to avoid the death penalty rather than an act of remorse, especially given their previous convictions [3], [4].

**Disposition:** The decision is AFFIRMED, with the modification that the indemnity to the heirs is increased from P6,000.00 to P12,000.00 [5].
