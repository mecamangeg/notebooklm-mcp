I. CAPTION
THE PROVINCE OF ZAMBOANGA DEL NORTE v. CITY OF ZAMBOANGA, SECRETARY OF FINANCE AND COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-24440, June 30, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In a main decision dated March 28, 1968, the Supreme Court declared Republic Act No. 3039 unconstitutional insofar as it deprived the Province of Zamboanga del Norte of its share in 26 lots situated within Zamboanga City without just compensation, holding that said lots were patrimonial property of the province [1]. The City of Zamboanga filed a Motion for Reconsideration, contending that the 26 lots have always been used for public purposes, such as school sites and playgrounds, and thus title should vest in the City free of charge under R.A. 3039 [2]. The City submitted photographs, plans, and certifications to prove the lots were part of the Zamboanga Trade School, Normal College, and other elementary schools [2], [3]. The Province opposed the motion, arguing that the evidence was not "newly discovered" and thus inadmissible, and claiming the lots were vacant or improved in bad faith [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the case should be remanded for a new trial to determine the actual nature and use of the 26 lots despite procedural objections.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that since the contending parties are actually subdivisions of one entity, the Republic of the Philippines, public interest is involved and demands that the issues be determined speedily without regard to technicalities [5]. In the interest of justice and equity, the Court set aside its main decision regarding the 26 lots and the monetary indemnities awarded [5].

The records were ordered remanded to the court of origin for a new trial, where parties may present evidence to show whether or not the lots were actually devoted to public use prior to the enactment of R.A. 3039. The lower court was directed to decide the issues anew based on the evidence and the principles of law laid down in the Supreme Court's main decision [5].
