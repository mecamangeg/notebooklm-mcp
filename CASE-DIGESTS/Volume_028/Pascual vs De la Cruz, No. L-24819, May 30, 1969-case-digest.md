I. CAPTION
**TESTATE ESTATE OF CATALINA DE LA CRUZ, ANDRES PASCUAL v. PEDRO DE LA CRUZ, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-24819, May 30, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., Acting C.J.

II. FACTS
On January 2, 1960, Catalina de la Cruz died at the age of 89. Andres Pascual, who was not blood-related but was raised by the decedent as her own son, filed a petition for the probate of her will executed in 1954, which named him as executor and sole heir [1]. Pedro de la Cruz and 26 other nephews and nieces of the decedent opposed the petition, alleging that the will’s execution was defective due to inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimonies, that the witnesses were biased due to their friendship with Pascual, and that the will was procured through fraud and undue influence [2].

The Court of First Instance admitted the will to probate, finding that the inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimonies were not substantial. The oppositors appealed directly to the Supreme Court, arguing the lower court erred in giving credence to the subscribing witnesses despite contradictions regarding the weather, the sequence of signing, and the length of time to complete the act [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the contradictions in the testimonies of the subscribing witnesses regarding the details of the will's execution warrant its disallowance.
2. W/N the friendly relations between the subscribing witnesses and the proponent disqualify them or affect their credibility.
3. W/N the will was procured through undue influence or fraud.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The contradictions and inconsistencies regarding unimportant details (such as weather conditions or the sequence of signing) do not alter the probative value of the testimonies on the due execution of the will [4]. Considering the eight-year lapse between the execution of the will (1954) and the testimonies (1962), such errors of recall are consonant with the "treachery of human memory" [5]. Unanimity among witnesses is not required; a will may be admitted to probate even if one witness testifies contrary to the others, provided the court is satisfied that the will was executed and attested in the manner provided by law (*Fernandez vs. Tantoco*) [6].

2. **NO.** Friendly relations of the subscribing witnesses with the testator or the beneficiaries do not affect the credibility of the former [7]. The proven friendship between the proponent and the instrumental witnesses has no bearing on their qualification to testify. It is not unlikely that the testatrix, suffering from rheumatism, entrusted the task of requesting witnesses to Pascual, whom she treated as a son [5].

3. **NO.** To avoid a will, the influence exerted must be of a kind that so overpowers and subjugates the mind of the testator as to destroy their free agency and make them express the will of another (*Coso vs. Fernandez Deza*) [8]. The burden is on the challenger to show substantial evidence of such influence. The presumption of undue influence where a beneficiary participates in drafting the will does not apply here because the will was prepared by a lawyer (who happened to be the proponent's nephew). A member of the bar is presumed to follow the testatrix's instructions and cannot be convicted of unprofessional conduct without clear proof [9].

**Decision affirmed.**
