I. CAPTION
ANTONIO NARITO v. JOSE CARRIDO, G.R. No. L-27792, July 28, 1969, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Antonio Narito was the defendant in a civil case filed by respondent Jose Carrido in the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur. After a judgment was rendered against him, Narito appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA required him to pay the docket fee and file 40 printed copies of the record on appeal [1]. Narito paid the P53.00 docket fee but moved to file only a typewritten or mimeographed record on appeal, claiming he was 67 years old, poor, and that typhoons had destroyed the coconut trees on his small parcel of land [1], [2]. The CA denied his motion and subsequent reconsiderations, insisting on printed copies [3], [2]. Narito filed a petition with the Supreme Court to set aside the CA resolutions, invoking the constitutional right to free access to courts [2]. The CA answered that Narito was not truly impoverished as he owned land and had paid his lawyer P400.00 in fees [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals is the proper forum to entertain a petition to be allowed to appeal as a pauper.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court of Appeals is not the proper forum. Under Section 16, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court (1964), the trial court, not the appellate court, is the proper forum to ventilate one's claim to be allowed to litigate as a pauper [5], [6]. The Rule explicitly states that "[a] petition to be allowed to appeal as pauper shall not be entertained by the appellate court" [7]. The rationale is that whether a party-litigant is so poor as to qualify as a pauper is a question of fact that is best determined by the trial court, which may require the presentation of evidence [7], [8]. Narito failed to ask the trial court for permission to prosecute his defense as a pauper [9].

The petition is DENIED [9].
