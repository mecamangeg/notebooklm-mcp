I. CAPTION
AMBROSIO SALUD v. THE HON. EXECUTIVE SECRETARY TO THE PRESIDENT, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25446, May 22, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ambrosio Salud claimed to be the successor-in-interest of an original applicant for a parcel of friar land located in Quintana, Tanza, Cavite. He sought recognition of his rights, which was granted by the Director of Lands and confirmed by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources. However, on appeal, the respondent Executive Secretary reversed these rulings, declaring the land open for public sale [1].

Salud filed a special civil action for certiorari and mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to challenge the Executive Secretary's decision. The CFI of Manila (Judge Montesa) dismissed the action, ruling that since the case affected title to or possession of real property, the venue properly lay in the province where the land was located (Cavite), and thus the Manila court lacked jurisdiction [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance of Manila has jurisdiction to review an administrative decision regarding real property located in a different province.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal order. The Court held that a petition for review of an administrative decision concerning real property subject to litigation should be filed in the Court of First Instance of the province or city where the officer who rendered the decision holds office, and not where the real property is located [3].

The Court cited established jurisprudence, including *Dizon v. Bayona* and *Sarabia v. The Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources*, which affirmed the jurisdiction of the CFI of Manila to review administrative orders concerning lands located in provinces such as Batangas and Oriental Mindoro [4]. The Court emphasized that the competence of the Manila court to pass on the validity of orders by national officials is settled law [5].

Accordingly, the decision was set aside and the case was remanded to the lower court for determination on its merits [6].
