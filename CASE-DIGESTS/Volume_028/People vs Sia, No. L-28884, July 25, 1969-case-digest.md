I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. NOLY SIA, G.R. No. L-28884, July 25, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Rubina Aguirre and accused Noly Sia were public school teachers and sweethearts [1]. On March 27, 1967, Sia gave Aguirre tablets for her headache which made her dizzy and weak. Aguirre alleged that she woke up to Sia having carnal knowledge of her; she was too weak to scream but recognized him. Afterward, Sia promised to marry her, so she did not report the incident immediately despite becoming pregnant [1]. However, in August 1967, Sia married another woman, prompting Aguirre to file a complaint for rape [1]. Sia admitted to the sexual intercourse but claimed it was consensual [2]. The Court of First Instance of Masbate convicted Sia of rape, sentencing him to life imprisonment and ordering him to acknowledge and support the child and pay indemnity [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused is guilty of rape beyond reasonable doubt.
2. W/N the accused is civilly liable for acknowledgment, support, and indemnity despite acquittal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the guilt of the accused was not established beyond reasonable doubt [4]. The case hinged on the complainant's uncorroborated testimony regarding the alleged deceit and drugging, weighed against the accused's claim of consent and the fact that the complaint was not filed until five months after the incident, immediately after the accused married another woman [4]. While this does not imply the complainant's version was false, the strict quantum of evidence required for a criminal conviction was not met [4], [5].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the obligation to acknowledge and support the child, as well as the indemnity of P6,000.00 to the complainant, remains in order [5]. Since the accused admitted the commission of the carnal act and did not deny the paternity of the child resulting therefrom, the civil liability subsists despite the acquittal on the criminal charge [6], [5].

The decision is **REVERSED** as to the conviction for rape, but **AFFIRMED** regarding the order to acknowledge the child, provide support, and pay indemnity. The case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for the determination of the amount of support [5].
