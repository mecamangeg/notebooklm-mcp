I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, LINA VELMONTE, RODOLFO CORNEJO and FELICISIMO Y. GUEVARRA, G.R. No. L-27117, July 30, 1969, Concepcion, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On June 2, 1953, the Municipal Court of Manila rendered judgment ordering respondents Velmonte, Cornejo, and Guevarra to pay PNB the sum of P1,001.02 with interest. On July 20, 1956, respondent Cornejo made a partial payment of P150.00. On January 28, 1964, PNB filed a complaint for the revival of the 1953 judgment. PNB argued that Cornejo's partial payment in 1956 interrupted the ten-year prescriptive period for enforcing the judgment. The Municipal Court dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription. On appeal, the Court of First Instance reversed the dismissal. The Court of Appeals subsequently reversed the CFI, ruling that the action had indeed prescribed. [2]

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the partial payment made by the debtor interrupts the prescriptive period for an action to revive a judgment. [3]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that under Article 1155 of the Civil Code, the prescription of actions is interrupted only by: (1) filing an action in court; (2) a written extrajudicial demand by the creditor; or (3) a **written** acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor [3].

While a partial payment constitutes an *implied* acknowledgment of a debt, it is not a *written* acknowledgment as required by the present Civil Code. Unlike the old Spanish Civil Code (Art. 1973), which allowed any act of acknowledgment to interrupt prescription, the current law strictly requires writing [4, 5]. Therefore, a payment not coupled with a written communication signed by the payor does not toll the statute of limitations [3, 6]. Furthermore, Article 1151, which refers to obligations to pay principal with interest or annuity at stipulated intervals, does not apply to a final judgment [7].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [8].
