I. CAPTION
CESAR R. BORROMEO v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, QUEZON CITY BOARD OF CANVASSERS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-29369, July 24, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cesar R. Borromeo filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to annul the November 14, 1967 elections in Quezon City. He alleged that the elections were characterized by serious frauds, irregularities, and flagrant violations of election laws, specifically noting that 148 precincts lacked voting booths and others had insufficient booths [1]. Borromeo prayed for a preliminary injunction to stop the Board of Canvassers from proclaiming winning candidates and sought a declaration of failure of elections [2].

The CFI granted the respondents' motion to dismiss, relying on the Supreme Court's decision in *Abes v. Commission on Elections* [3]. Borromeo appealed, arguing that *Abes* was inapplicable because he sought relief from the CFI rather than the Commission on Elections directly [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a direct action to annul an election is the proper remedy for alleged irregularities such as fraud and lack of voting booths.
2. W/N a private citizen has the standing to file a petition for annulment of elections based on a general interest in honest elections.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that questions regarding terrorism, vote-buying, and other irregularities must be ventilated in a regular election protest pursuant to Section 174 of the Election Code [4, 5]. Existing laws do not permit a direct action to annul an election; such a remedy may be granted only as an incident to an election contest [6, 7]. The duty of the Board of Canvassers is ministerial and does not extend to passing upon the validity of ballots [4]. The proper procedure is to file an election protest within two weeks after the proclamation of results [5].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that an interest shared in common with the community in general is manifestly inadequate to entitle a petitioner to seek the annulment of an election [8, 9]. One of the tests to determine if a cause of action exists is whether the petitioner has suffered a distinct injury. Borromeo merely alleged interest as a citizen, which is insufficient [9]. To hold otherwise would allow any member of the population or a losing political party to institute proceedings to annul an election, which is not sanctioned by law [8, 9].

**Order affirmed.** [10]
