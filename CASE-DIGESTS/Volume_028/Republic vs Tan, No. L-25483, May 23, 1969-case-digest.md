I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LUCIA TAN, G.R. No. L-25483, May 23, 1969, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
In August 1954, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) discovered that respondent Lucia Tan failed to file income tax returns for the years 1949 to 1952 [1]. The BIR filed returns on her behalf and issued assessment notices totaling P2,310.50, which Tan refused to pay [1, 2]. On May 8, 1958, the Republic filed a complaint for collection [2]. Tan admitted to not filing returns but raised the defense of prescription, arguing that under Section 51(d) of the National Internal Revenue Code, the three-year period for assessment had lapsed [2]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint on the ground that the action had already prescribed [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the government's judicial action to collect the taxes has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the three-year period provided in Section 51(d) refers only to the summary remedy of distraint and levy, not to judicial actions for collection [4]. Since this case involves a failure to file a return, Section 332(a) of the Tax Code applies, which allows a proceeding in court for collection to be instituted "at any time within ten years after the discovery of the falsity, fraud, or omission" [4]. The omission was discovered in August 1954 and the action was commenced in May 1958, well within the ten-year period [5].

The orders appealed from are set aside and the case is remanded to the court below for further proceedings [6].
