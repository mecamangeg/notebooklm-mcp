I. CAPTION
GERARDO SAMSON, JR. v. FELIPE TARROZA and DIRECTOR OF PATENTS, G.R. No. L-20354, July 28, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Gerardo Samson, Jr. was awarded Utility Model Patent No. 27 on May 22, 1958, for a "Dumping and Detachable Wheelbarrow." Respondent Felipe Tarroza was subsequently granted a utility model patent for a "Side Tilting-Dumping Wheelbarrow." Samson filed a petition with the Director of Patents to cancel Tarroza's patent, arguing that Tarroza’s device was not patentable and that Tarroza was not the true inventor, alleging he copied Samson's design as they were brothers-in-law living on adjoining lots.

The Director of Patents denied the petition for cancellation, ruling that Tarroza's model possessed "practical utility" entitling it to a patent, and that the evidence regarding the alleged copying was insufficient. Samson appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N respondent Tarroza's utility model patent is valid based on the concept of "practical utility."

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Director of Patents. Under Section 55 of Republic Act No. 165 (Patent Law), there is an express recognition that any new model of implements or tools, even if not possessing the "quality of invention" or the "flash of genius," is entitled to a utility model patent if it possesses "practical utility." The Court found that Tarroza's side tilting-dumping wheelbarrow, a product of ingenuity and industry, had a place in the market and met the statutory requirement of practical utility [1].

Furthermore, the Court held that in appeals from the Director of Patents, only questions of law may be reviewed; findings of fact (such as the determination of true authorship) are conclusive unless unsupported by substantial evidence [2]. The petition was denied, and the decision of the Director of Patents was affirmed.
