I. CAPTION
VICENTE CARBAJAL and ARCADIO QUEMADA v. PONCIANA DIOLOLA, et al., G.R. No. L-23275, May 29, 1969, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Carbajal and Quemada filed a complaint for recovery of land against defendants Diolola, et al. in the Court of First Instance of Samar. After the plaintiffs rested their case, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss (demurrer to evidence) on the ground of insufficiency of evidence. The motion did not contain a reservation of the right to present evidence in case of denial. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss.

Consequently, the plaintiffs moved to deny the defendants the right to present evidence due to the lack of express reservation. The trial court granted the plaintiffs' motion, barring the defendants from presenting their side, and rendered judgment declaring the plaintiffs as owners of the land. The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved pure questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendants waived their right to present evidence by filing a demurrer to evidence without an express reservation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that a reservation by the defendant of the right to present evidence is not necessary because the rule itself reserves such right. What extinguishes the right is a waiver or renunciation, which was not present in this case.

Citing *Director of Lands v. Ceniza* and Section 1, Rule 35 of the Revised Rules of Court, the Court explained that if a trial court denies a demurrer to evidence, it must proceed to hear the defendant’s evidence. This ensures all relevant proofs are on record for a correct judgment and avoids the delay of remanding cases. A defendant only loses the right to present evidence if the trial court *grants* the demurrer and that dismissal is subsequently *reversed* on appeal. Since the trial court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, they retained the right to present their evidence.

The judgment appealed from is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED to the court of origin for further proceedings.
