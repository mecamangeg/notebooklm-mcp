**I. CAPTION**
ROSE BUSH MALIG, et al. v. MARIA SANTOS BUSH, G.R. No. L-22761, May 31, 1969, Makalintal, J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiffs Rose Bush Malig et al. filed a complaint alleging they were the acknowledged natural children of the deceased John T. Bush and were fraudulently excluded from his estate by the defendant, Maria Santos Bush, who had secured her appointment as administratrix and approved a partition excluding them [2, 3]. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss based solely on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, arguing the probate court had exclusive cognizance [4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila granted the dismissal, not on the jurisdictional ground alleged, but on the ground of prescription [4]. Notably, a previous motion to dismiss alleging prescription had already been denied by the court because the ground did not appear indubitable [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the trial court may dismiss the action on a ground not alleged in the motion to dismiss. [5]

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the lower court cannot dismiss the complaint *motu proprio* on a ground not relied upon by the defendant in the motion to dismiss, as this denies the plaintiffs a chance to argue the point [6]. Citing *Manila Herald Publishing Co., Inc. v. Ramos*, the Court ruled that a court may only dismiss an action on its own motion if the plaintiff fails to appear at trial, fails to prosecute for an unreasonable length of time, or fails to comply with the Rules or court orders [7]. Additionally, the ground of prescription was not indubitable on the face of the complaint because the plaintiffs alleged they were *already* acknowledged natural children, rendering the time limits in Article 137 of the Civil Code inapplicable at that stage [8].

The orders appealed from were **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** for further proceedings [9].
