I. CAPTION
LIANGA BAY LOGGING CO., INC. v. NARCISO LANSANG, AGO TIMBER CORPORATION and PASTOR D. AGO, G.R. No. L-21025, June 14, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Lianga Bay Logging Co. filed an action for damages and injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against Narciso Lansang, alleging encroachment on its timber concession. The complaint was later amended to include Pastor Ago and Ago Timber Corp. as defendants [1, 2]. The defendants filed answers with counterclaims for damages, asserting they were operating within their own concession under a valid license [3].

The plaintiff’s complaint was dismissed due to failure to appear at trial, and the case proceeded on the defendants’ counterclaims [4]. The plaintiff then moved to dismiss the counterclaims, arguing that the subject matter was already being litigated in an administrative case before the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DANR) and in two other pending civil actions involving the same parties [4]. The CFI of Manila dismissed the counterclaims. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court correctly dismissed the counterclaims on the ground that the subject matter was involved in pending administrative and civil actions.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. The Court found that the subject matters of the counterclaims were indeed involved in and covered by issues litigated in prior actions:

1.  **Administrative Case:** A boundary dispute regarding who was entitled to the lumber concession area was pending before the DANR. The Court held that this dispute must first be resolved by the competent authority before damages or ejectment could be determined [6, 7].
2.  **Civil Case No. 1416 (CFI Surigao del Sur):** A pending case where Lianga Bay sought damages from Ago Timber for interference in the same disputed area [8, 9].
3.  **Civil Case No. 815 (CFI Agusan):** A pending appeal regarding a forcible entry complaint filed by Ago Timber against Lianga Bay. The damages claimed in this case were the same as those involved in the dismissed counterclaims [9, 10].

Since the issues were already being litigated elsewhere, the dismissal was proper [10]. The order appealed from is affirmed [11].
