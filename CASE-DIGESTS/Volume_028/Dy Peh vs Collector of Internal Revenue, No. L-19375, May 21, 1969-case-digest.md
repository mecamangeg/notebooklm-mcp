**I. CAPTION**
**DY PEH, AND/OR VICTORY RUBBER MANUFACTURING v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE**, G.R. No. L-19375, May 21, 1969, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Dy Peh, doing business as Victory Rubber Manufacturing in Cebu, was assessed by the respondent for deficiency percentage taxes totaling P51,939.27 after the BIR discovered anomalies in the Cebu City Treasurer's office [1, 2]. While the original official receipts in Dy Peh's possession showed full payment, the duplicate copies kept by the government reflected smaller amounts actually paid [3]. Dy Peh claimed he paid the full amount personally by check and should not be penalized for anomalies committed by government employees [4]. However, the respondent contended that Dy Peh employed a business agent, Tan Chuan Liong, who prepared the receipts and misappropriated a portion of the funds to pay the taxes of other clients [5]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled against Dy Peh, finding that he did employ Tan Chuan Liong and was estopped from claiming otherwise because he accepted cancelled checks returned to him which indicated on their back that the funds were applied to other taxpayers' receipts [6, 7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner is liable for the deficiency taxes resulting from the acts of his agent.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court affirmed the CTA's findings, ruling that the petitioner is bound by the acts of his agent.

The Court applied the Civil Law principle that where a contract of agency exists, the agent's acts bind the principal [8, 9]. The Court upheld the CTA's factual finding that Tan Chuan Liong was the petitioner's agent, noting that the Supreme Court generally does not review findings of fact of the Court of Tax Appeals but only errors of law [10]. Since the agent misappropriated the funds and paid the government less than what was due, the principal (Dy Peh) remains liable for the deficiency [11]. The Court emphasized that the petitioner's proper recourse is to file an appropriate civil or criminal action against his agent, rather than avoiding liability to the government [9].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals was **AFFIRMED** [12].
