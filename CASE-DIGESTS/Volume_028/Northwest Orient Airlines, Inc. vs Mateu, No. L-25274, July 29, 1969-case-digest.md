I. CAPTION
NORTHWEST ORIENT AIRLINES, INC. v. LOUISE MATEU and the WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-25274, July 29, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Louise Mateu, a Passenger Sales Agent for Northwest Orient Airlines, Inc., suffered injuries during her employment: a 1948 car accident in Tokyo and a 1957 incident where her aircraft lost altitude. On September 8, 1964, she was disabled from work due to recurring right shoulder pain diagnosed as biceps tendonitis and fibrositis. She filed a Notice of Injury and Claim for Compensation on January 27, 1965 [1].

The petitioner, through its insurer, attempted to reserve its right to controvert the claim pending investigation, but the reservation was made out of time [2]. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) ruled in favor of Mateu, holding that the injury was work-connected and that the petitioner had failed to controvert the claim effectively [1, 2]. Petitioner appealed, arguing it was denied due process and that the claim was filed late [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is barred from contesting the claim due to its failure to controvert within the prescribed period.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the WCC decision. The findings of fact by the WCC regarding the petitioner's failure to controvert are binding and conclusive as they are based on substantial evidence [5].

Under the Workmen's Compensation Act, failure to controvert a claim within the statutory period amounts to a waiver, renunciation, or forfeiture of the right to defend against the claim, including the defense that the claim was filed out of time [4]. Citing *Victorias Milling Co., Inc. v. WCC* and *Filipino Pipe & Foundry Corp. v. WCC*, the Court held that in the absence of controversion, the claim is deemed admitted, and the employer effectively loses its right to demand a day in court, rendering the due process argument invalid [3].

The decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission is affirmed [1, 6].
