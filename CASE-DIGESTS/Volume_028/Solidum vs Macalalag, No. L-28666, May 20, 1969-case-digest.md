I. CAPTION
ESPERANZA SOLIDUM v. THE HONORABLE FELIX V. MACALALAG AND CATALINO SULAM, G.R. No. L-28666, May 20, 1969, 28 SCRA 200, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
In the 1967 elections for municipal councilors in Ibajay, Aklan, Petitioner Solidum and Respondent Sulam were candidates. During the canvassing on November 20, 1967, the Board of Canvassers discovered that the election return from Precinct 25 omitted Sulam’s name and votes [1]. Despite this, four members of the Board continued the canvass and proclaimed Solidum as the eighth councilor-elect based on incomplete returns [2]. If Sulam's 34 votes from Precinct 25 were counted, he would have won by seven votes [2]. On November 22, the Board of Election Inspectors (BEI) executed an affidavit admitting the omission was an honest mistake [3].

Sulam filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) presided by Judge Macalalag for the correction of the returns or a judicial recount [4]. The CFI issued a preliminary injunction restraining Solidum from assuming office [5]. Solidum filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition, challenging the CFI's jurisdiction [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the proclamation of the petitioner based on incomplete returns is valid.
2. W/N the CFI has jurisdiction to order the correction of the election returns.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that a proclamation based on incomplete returns is null and void [7]. The Board of Canvassers knew the return from Precinct 25 was vitiated by a clerical mistake yet proceeded with the proclamation [8]. Proclamation is in "umbilical dependence upon the returns," and holding office cannot be based on a technicality that defeats the will of the electorate [9].

2. **YES.** Under Section 154 of the Revised Election Code, the court has the power to authorize the alteration or amendment of election returns when the members of the Board of Election Inspectors unanimously admit the error and are willing to rectify it [10, 11]. In this case, the inspectors unanimously represented to the court that the omission was a mistake and sought correction [10]. Furthermore, the remedy was sought within the two-week period for filing an election contest, thus the court retained jurisdiction [12, 13].

The petition is DENIED [13].
