I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. APOLINARIO LUMANTAS @ PEOPLE, G.R. No. L-28355, July 17, 1969, 28 SCRA 764, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On November 14, 1963, at a marketplace in Mobod, Oroquieta, Misamis Occidental, Laureto Limpahan was stabbed and killed. Prosecution witness Francisco Bation saw the accused Apolinario Lumantas and his co-accused Olimpio Badiang situated on both sides of the victim immediately before the attack. The victim sustained multiple wounds, including a fatal stab wound below the left nipple. After the attack, Lumantas fled the scene. Badiang was apprehended with a bloody bolo, while Lumantas relied on the defense of alibi, claiming he was gathering tuba in Upper Lamak, about two kilometers away.

The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Misamis Occidental convicted both accused of Murder. However, the trial court imposed an erroneous penalty on Lumantas, lowering it to *prisión mayor* on the ground that he "fled" the scene, which the judge treated as a mitigating factor or reason to lower the penalty. The CFI also ordered them to pay an indemnity of only P1,500 each. Both appealed, but Badiang withdrew his appeal, making his conviction and the lower indemnity final. The Court of Appeals, finding that the proper penalty for Lumantas should be *reclusión perpetua*, certified the case to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi merits credence.
2. W/N the penalty imposed by the trial court was correct.
3. W/N the accused-appellant is liable for the increased indemnity of P12,000 despite the co-conspirator's final judgment for a lesser amount.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Alibi is one of the weakest defenses. To establish it, the accused must show it was physically impossible for him to be at the crime scene [1]. Lumantas admitted being only two kilometers away, failing to prove impossibility. Furthermore, the lack of motive does not preclude conviction when the crime and participation are definitely proved by positive identification [2, 3].

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court modified the penalty to **reclusión perpetua**. The crime committed was Murder, qualified by treachery (sudden attack from both sides), which absorbed the circumstance of abuse of superior strength [4]. Flight indicates guilt and is not a mitigating circumstance [5]. Absent aggravating or mitigating circumstances (evident premeditation was not proven), the penalty for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code must be imposed in its medium period, which is *reclusión perpetua* [6].

3. **YES.** Following *People v. Pantoja*, the indemnity for death was raised to P12,000 [7]. Although co-conspirators are normally jointly and severally liable, Badiang's liability was fixed at P1,500 due to his withdrawn appeal. Consequently, the Court ruled that Lumantas must pay the full P12,000 to the heirs of the victim, but granted him the right to demand contribution from Badiang in the sum of P1,500 [8].

**Disposition:** Decision modified. Apolinario Lumantas is sentenced to *reclusión perpetua* and ordered to pay the heirs of Laureto Limpahan P12,000.00, with the right to demand P1,500.00 contribution from co-accused Olimpio Badiang.
