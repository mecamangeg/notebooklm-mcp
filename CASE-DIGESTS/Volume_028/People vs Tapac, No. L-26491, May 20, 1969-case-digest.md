I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PASTOR TAPAC, ET AL., G.R. No. L-26491, May 20, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On June 1, 1963, in Samar, Felipe Mabutas (victim) attempted to buy a carabao from Trinidad Ocenar and displayed cash during the negotiation. When the sale did not push through, appellant Antonio Tapac asked Mabutas for a loan, which the latter refused. Resenting the refusal, Antonio's son, Pastor Tapac, suddenly struck Mabutas with a bolo. A general attack ensued involving Antonio, Pastor, and their co-appellants Glicerio Cabigayan, Ramon Cabigayan, Rodrigo Tapac, and Juanito Abegonia [1, 2]. They inflicted multiple fatal wounds and unnecessarily mutilated the victim by cutting off his ear, tongue, and jaw, and gouging out his eyes [2, 3]. Pastor then took the victim's wallet containing the money [2].

The Court of First Instance of Samar convicted Pastor Tapac of Homicide complexed with Robbery, reasoning he alone took the money, but convicted the other five appellants only of Homicide, finding no conspiracy for the robbery [4-6]. The accused appealed, with Ramon Cabigayan and Rodrigo Tapac specifically arguing they committed an "impossible crime" because they allegedly stabbed the victim when he was already dead [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellants conspired to commit the crime of Robbery with Homicide.
2. W/N appellants Ramon Cabigayan and Rodrigo Tapac are liable only for an impossible crime on the ground that the victim was already dead when they attacked.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that conspiracy was established by the evidence. The appellants' cupidity was aroused by seeing the victim's cash, and they acted in concert following the refusal of the loan [8]. In conspiracy, a previous agreement is not necessary; it is sufficient that the accused had the same purpose and joined together in its execution [9]. Consequently, the act of one is the act of all, and every conspirator is responsible for the unlawful acts of the others, including the robbery committed by Pastor Tapac [9]. All appellants were found guilty of Robbery with Homicide under Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code [10].

2. **NO.** The Court rejected the defense of impossible crime. The claim that the victim was dead when Ramon and Rodrigo struck him was contradicted by evidence that a co-accused urged the group to keep stabbing so the victim "cannot go home," implying he was still alive [11]. Furthermore, since conspiracy was established, the acts of the co-conspirators who inflicted the initial fatal wounds are attributable to all appellants [9, 10].

The decision was **AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION**. All six appellants were found guilty of Robbery with Homicide. Considering the aggravating circumstances of treachery and cruelty, offset by the mitigating circumstance of non-habitual intoxication, the penalty imposed was *Reclusion Perpetua*, and the indemnity was raised to P12,000.00 [10, 12, 13].
