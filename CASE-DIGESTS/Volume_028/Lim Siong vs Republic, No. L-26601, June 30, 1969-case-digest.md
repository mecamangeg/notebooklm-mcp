I. CAPTION
In the Matter of the Petition of Lim Siong to be Admitted a Citizen of the Philippines, LIM SIONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-26601, June 30, 1969, 28 SCRA 689, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lim Siong filed a petition for naturalization on June 8, 1960. The Court of First Instance of Manila granted the petition on October 14, 1961. On February 21, 1964, the lower court allowed petitioner to take his oath of allegiance, which was administered three days later on February 24, 1964, resulting in the issuance of a Naturalization Certificate.

On August 3, 1965, the Republic filed a motion to denaturalize Lim Siong, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction and the certificate was fraudulently obtained. The Republic established that: (1) Lim Siong failed to state all former places of residence (Quezon Blvd., Escolta, 1457 Soler) in his petition; (2) He did not file a Declaration of Intention, claiming exemption based on 30 years of residence, despite having significant absences in China between 1931 and 1949; (3) He concealed the existence of two children living in China; and (4) His children in the Philippines were enrolled in a Chinese school (Philippine Chinese Educational School) at the time of filing. The lower court's decision was appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to state all former places of residence is fatal to the petition.
2. W/N the petitioner was exempt from filing a Declaration of Intention.
3. W/N the concealment of children and enrollment in a Chinese school are grounds for denaturalization.
4. W/N the administration of the oath of allegiance was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The failure to state former places of residence is fatal and affects the jurisdiction of the court to "hear and decide the case" (*Go v. Republic*). The term "residence" encompasses all places where the petitioner actually and physically resided. Non-disclosure deprives the public and government of a fair opportunity to check the petitioner's activities.

2. **NO.** The petitioner was not exempt. Section 6 of the Revised Naturalization Law requires 30 years of continuous residence for exemption. Lim Siong's residence was "punctured with interruptions" due to long visits to China, which bars him from claiming continuous residence (*Sy See v. Republic*). Consequently, the failure to file the mandatory Declaration of Intention rendered the entire proceeding null and void.

3. **YES.** The concealment of two children in the application is sufficient ground to dismiss the case. Furthermore, enrolling children in a Chinese school evinces a purpose to instill a Chinese upbringing and demonstrates a lack of earnest intention to identify with the Filipino community (*Dy v. Republic*). Transferring the children to Filipino schools *after* the petition was filed does not cure the defect, as compliance with the educational requirement is mandatory throughout the entire period of residence prior to the hearing.

4. **NO.** The administration of the oath was null and void. Taking the oath only three days after the order allowing it, before the decision became final and before the government's appeal period expired, was "highly irregular" and an attempt to render the government's appeal nugatory (*Ong So v. Republic*).

**ACCORDINGLY**, the decision is REVERSED. The naturalization proceedings are declared null and void, and the Naturalization Certificate is cancelled.
