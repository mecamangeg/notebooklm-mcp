I. CAPTION
RODOLFO BAUTISTA Y VILLANUEVA v. COURT OF APPEALS and PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18690, May 21, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On December 16, 1957, petitioner Rodolfo Bautista, along with Apolinario Maloles and Edgar Abella, boarded a jeepney driven by Alfredo Salazar. After driving to several places, Abella struck Salazar with a bottle, killing him [1, 2]. Abella then took the wheel, and the three dumped the victim’s body along the road before proceeding to Tanauan, Batangas, where Bautista separated from the group [2]. Maloles later informed Bautista that the jeep had been sold and offered him PHP 15.00; Bautista refused the money but asked for and accepted a bottle of beer and cigarettes instead [2]. He kept the crime secret until his arrest [2].

The Court of First Instance of Manila convicted Bautista as an accomplice to the crime of robbery with homicide [3]. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the decision *in toto*, rejecting Bautista's defense that his presence was merely passive [3-5]. Bautista appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the evidence showed mere presence without cooperation and that the CA erred in considering the testimony of his co-accused, Maloles [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioner is liable as an accomplice to robbery with homicide.
2. W/N the testimony of the co-accused (Maloles) was improperly considered against the petitioner.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed that the petitioner’s actions went beyond mere passive presence. The record established that the group had a previous agreement to come to Manila to "have a good time," remained together from the time they boarded the vehicle until they dumped the body, and that the petitioner accepted a share of the loot in the form of beer and cigarettes [7]. Furthermore, he failed to notify authorities about the crime [5, 7]. These acts constitute cooperation sufficient to sustain a conviction as an accomplice.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that even if there was an error in considering the testimony of Maloles (given after the conspiracy had arguably ceased), it did not affect the conviction because said testimony was treated merely as corroborative evidence [8]. The evidence presented directly against the petitioner was sufficient on its own to sustain the findings of guilt [8].

**Decision affirmed.**
