I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF JOSE MARIA CARLOS TARRAGA BULL ZABALETA TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. JOSE MARIA CARLOS TARRAGA BULL ZABALETA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-25401, June 30, 1969, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
Jose Maria Carlos Tarraga Bull Zabaleta, a Spanish citizen, filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental. In his petition, he alleged that his present place of residence was "San Carlos City, Philippines," where he had stayed for two years, and that his former place of residence was "Manila." He did not provide specific street names or building numbers for either location. The CFI granted the petition. The Republic of the Philippines appealed, arguing that the petition was fatally defective for failing to comply with Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law, which requires the petitioner to state their "present and former places of residence." [1, 2]

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for naturalization is fatally defective for failing to state the specific street addresses and building numbers of the petitioner's present and former residences.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the petition was fatally defective. Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law mandates that a petitioner state their "present and former places of residence." The Court expressly ruled that in a city or town where streets have names and buildings are numbered, the petition must specify the street name and building number. For towns where buildings are not numbered, the street name and the building's location must be stated. Zabaleta's general mention of "San Carlos City" and "Manila" was insufficient. The Court reiterated that this requirement is intended to facilitate the checking of the petitioner's activities, qualifications, and moral character by the public and government agencies [3]. Citing *Chi v. Republic* and *Wayne Chang v. Republic*, the Court held that the failure to provide specific addresses is a serious flaw that prevents the trial court from acquiring jurisdiction over the case [4].

The judgment appealed from is reversed and the petition for naturalization is denied [5].
