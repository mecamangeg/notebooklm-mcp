I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RICARDO BERNAL, G.R. No. L-25623, May 8, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On February 18, 1965, in Tayum, Abra, accused Ricardo Bernal, using a carbine handed to him by co-accused Eduardo Bernal, willfully shot Guillermo Barro, Anastacio Barro, and Dominga Carnate Barro. Guillermo died instantaneously, while Anastacio and Dominga sustained gunshot wounds but survived due to timely medical assistance. The amended information charged Ricardo with the complex crime of "Murder with Double Frustrated Murder." Ricardo pleaded guilty to the information. The Court of First Instance of Abra ruled that the acts constituted a complex crime under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code and, consequently, sentenced him to death. The case was elevated to the Supreme Court on automatic review.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused may be convicted of the complex crime of murder with double frustrated murder.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the accused is guilty of three separate crimes, not a complex crime. The Court found that the shots fired by the accused, which killed one victim and wounded two others, were "distinct and separate acts." Under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code, a complex crime exists only when a "single act constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies" (*delito compuesto*) or when "an offense is a necessary means for committing the other" (*delito complejo*) [1]. Since the distinct shots did not constitute a single act, nor was the murder a necessary means to commit the frustrated murders (or vice versa), Article 48 does not apply.

Consequently, the judgment was modified. Ricardo Bernal was declared guilty of three separate crimes: (1) Murder, for which he was sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* (due to lack of votes for the death penalty); and (2) two counts of Frustrated Murder, for which he was sentenced to indeterminate penalties for *each* count.
