I. CAPTION
CENON MATEO v. HON. FLORENCIO MORENO, in his capacity as SECRETARY OF PUBLIC WORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS, G.R. No. L-21024, July 28, 1969, 28 SCRA 796, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In 1959, residents of Guiguinto, Bulacan, complained to the Highway District Engineer that Sapang Cabay, a public navigable stream, had been blocked by dikes and converted into fishponds. The complaint was referred to respondent Secretary of Public Works and Communications, who conducted an investigation pursuant to Republic Act No. 2056 [1]. On August 10, 1959, the Secretary found the creek to be a public navigable stream and ordered petitioner Cenon Mateo, who had acquired the property enclosing the creek, to remove the dikes within 30 days [1, 2].

Mateo's motion for reconsideration was denied. He then filed a petition for injunction with the Court of First Instance of Manila to restrain the enforcement of the decision. The CFI dismissed the petition [1, 2]. The case was certified to the Supreme Court. While Mateo initially questioned the constitutionality of RA 2056, he later conceded the Secretary's authority but argued that the factual findings constituted grave abuse of discretion [3]. He also relied on the fact that the property was covered by a Torrens title issued to his predecessor in 1953 [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the findings of fact by the Secretary of Public Works and Communications regarding the nature of the stream are binding on the courts.
2. W/N the inclusion of the stream within the petitioner’s certificate of title converts it into private property.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court applied the "substantial evidence" rule, which limits judicial review in administrative cases. Substantial evidence is "more than a scintilla" and refers to such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion [5, 6]. Courts cannot reassess the evidence or substitute their own findings for those of the administrative agency if the latter's findings are supported by substantial evidence [7]. Here, the Secretary's decision was supported by ocular inspections and testimonies from residents proving the creek was previously used for fishing and transport (bancas) and that its closure caused flooding [8, 9].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the absence of any mention of a navigable stream within a property covered by a certificate of title does not change the public character of the stream, nor does it make it the private property of the title holder [10, 11]. Such streams are covered by one of the exceptions in Section 39 of Act No. 496 [11]. Furthermore, the ownership of a navigable stream or its bed is not subject to acquisitive prescription [10, 12].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [13].
