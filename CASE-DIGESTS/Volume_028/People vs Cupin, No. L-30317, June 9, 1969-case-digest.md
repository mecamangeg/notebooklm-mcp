I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. THE HONORABLE FRANCISCO RO. CUPIN, JUDGE, CIRCUIT CRIMINAL COURT, XIV JUDICIAL DISTRICT, HON. CITY FISCAL, CEBU CITY, JOSE P. AMADORA, and ERNESTO DAKAY, G.R. No. L-30317, June 9, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
State Prosecutor Salcedo, designated by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to handle the prosecution of Ernesto Dakay for violation of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) independently of the City Fiscal, filed an information against Dakay. Respondent Judge Cupin of the Circuit Criminal Court, however, ordered a reinvestigation by the City Fiscal’s office (respondent Amadora), merely assisted by Salcedo. The City Fiscal subsequently moved to dismiss the criminal case for lack of evidence, which Judge Cupin granted in an order dated February 1, 1969.

Salcedo filed this petition for certiorari and prohibition on behalf of the Republic to annul Judge Cupin's proceedings. During the pendency of this petition, the DOJ revoked Salcedo's authority to prosecute the case. Dakay moved to dismiss the present petition on the ground that Salcedo no longer had standing. Meanwhile, on March 4, 1969, Judge Cupin issued a new order declaring that under Republic Act No. 5179, the Circuit Criminal Court lacked jurisdiction over the specific NIRC violation. He set aside his previous dismissal order and returned the case to the Court of First Instance.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the revocation of the special prosecutor's authority is a valid ground to dismiss the petition.
2. W/N the petition has become moot and academic.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the motion to dismiss based on the revocation of Fiscal Salcedo's authority, if resolved on the merits, should be denied. The petitioner in this special civil action is the Republic of the Philippines, not Fiscal Salcedo personally. The fact that the officer who commenced the petition is no longer authorized to prosecute it is not a legal ground for dismissal; the Solicitor General could continue the case if desired [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The Court held the case is moot and academic. Respondent Judge Cupin had already issued a subsequent order admitting that the Circuit Criminal Court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter under R.A. No. 5179. By declaring his previous order of dismissal (February 1, 1969) without force and effect and returning the case to the Executive Judge for raffle, the proceedings complained of were effectively set aside, rendering the petition unnecessary [2].

**CASE DISMISSED.**
