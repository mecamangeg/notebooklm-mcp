I. CAPTION
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-27188, May 29, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
The Insurance Company of North America (Appellee), as subrogee of Motor Service Company, Inc., filed a complaint against the Republic of the Philippines (Appellant) to recover P3,901.30 representing the value of lost truck replacement parts and damages caused by the Customs Arrastre Service [1]. The Republic raised the defense of immunity from suit, arguing that the operation of the arrastre service was a governmental function under the Tariff and Customs Code [2, 3]. The lower court rejected this defense and ordered the Republic to pay the claim [3].

The Republic filed a timely appeal. However, before filing its brief, the Republic moved to dismiss the case based on the Supreme Court’s subsequent ruling in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service* [4]. The Appellee countered by moving to dismiss the Republic's appeal, arguing that the Record on Appeal was defective for failing to state the date the Republic received the notice of the lower court's decision, a requirement to prove timeliness [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Republic of the Philippines is immune from suit regarding its operation of the Customs Arrastre Service.
2. W/N the appeal should be dismissed due to the failure of the Record on Appeal to state the date of receipt of the lower court's decision.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Republic is immune from suit. The Supreme Court applied the doctrine laid down in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service*, which held that the Republic operates the arrastre service at the Port of Manila as a governmental function and is therefore immune from suit [4, 6]. Consequently, the lower court had no jurisdiction to render judgment against the Republic in this nature of action [6].

2. **NO.** While the Record on Appeal was technically defective for failing to state the date of receipt of the decision, the Court ruled that this omission does not warrant the dismissal of the appeal when the appeal is meritorious and the lower court essentially lacked jurisdiction [7]. Since the State is immune from suit, the proceedings in the lower court were null, and dismissing the appeal on technical grounds would serve no purpose when the case itself is moot due to the jurisdictional defect [6, 8].

Accordingly, the case is **DISMISSED**.
