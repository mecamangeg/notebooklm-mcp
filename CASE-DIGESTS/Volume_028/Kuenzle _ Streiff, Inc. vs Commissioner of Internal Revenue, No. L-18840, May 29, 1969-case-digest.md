I. CAPTION
KUENZLE & STREIFF, INC. v. THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-18840, May 29, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Kuenzle & Streiff, Inc., a domestic corporation, filed its income tax returns for the years 1953, 1954, and 1955, declaring net losses [1]. The respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) disallowed the bonuses paid by the petitioner to its top officers and staff members as deductible expenses, finding them unreasonable [2]. Consequently, the CIR assessed deficiency income taxes against the petitioner amounting to P40,455.00 for 1953, P11,248.00 for 1954, and P16,228.00 for 1955 [2].

The petitioner appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), arguing that the bonuses were paid in good faith pursuant to a policy of granting low basic salaries augmented by substantial year-end bonuses [3]. The CTA affirmed the assessments (with a modification for the 1954 amount), ruling that the bonuses were not reasonable because they resulted in net losses for the company and were paid to officers who had not demonstrated special talents contributing to the business's success, while rank-and-file employees received no increases [4-6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the bonuses paid to the petitioner's officers are deductible as reasonable necessary and ordinary business expenses.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the decision of the CTA. Under Section 30(a)(1) of the National Internal Revenue Code, bonuses are deductible as ordinary and necessary expenses only if they represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered [7]. While there is no fixed test for reasonableness, the Court considers factors such as the amount and quality of services, the character of the taxpayer's business, the volume of net earnings, and general economic conditions [8].

In this case, the bonuses were deemed unreasonable because: (1) they were paid during years when the petitioner suffered substantial net losses [9]; (2) the payments were taken from operating funds (diverting what should have been dividends) or general reserves [10]; (3) the top officers did not possess extraordinary talent or training to justify such high compensation while the company was losing money [5]; and (4) ordinary employees received no salary increases during the same period [6]. Although an employer has the right to fix compensation, this right is not absolute and cannot be exercised to evade taxes [11].

The petition is denied, and the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [12].
