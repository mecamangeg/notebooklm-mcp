I. CAPTION
BELEN CRUZ v. EXEQUIEL CASTILLO, G.R. No. L-27232, June 30, 1969, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Belen Cruz filed a complaint against defendant Exequiel Castillo for compulsory recognition and support of her child, Anselma Armi Castillo [1]. The evidence established that Cruz and Castillo had sexual relations in 1959, resulting in the birth of Anselma on July 11, 1960 [2]. Castillo initially denied paternity and liability for support [3]. The trial court ruled in favor of Cruz, declaring Anselma as Castillo’s natural child and ordering him to pay monthly support calculated from the date of the filing of the complaint [4]. Castillo appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved purely questions of law [5]. On appeal, Castillo admitted paternity but argued that the lower court erred in ordering support to commence from the filing of the complaint rather than the date of the judgment [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N support for a natural child who has not been voluntarily recognized should commence from the date of the filing of the complaint.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the obligation to support commences only from the date of the judgment compelling recognition. Under the Civil Code, a natural child not recognized by the father has no rights, not even to support [5]. It is the fact of recognition, whether voluntary (under Article 278) or compulsory (under Article 283), that confers the rights of support and succession upon the child [6]. Since the defendant did not voluntarily recognize the child, his obligation to support did not exist until the trial court rendered judgment declaring him the father and compelling recognition [6]. Consequently, the support should commence from July 27, 1964, the date of the lower court's judgment [7]. The Supreme Court modified the decision, ordering the defendant to recognize the child and increasing the support to P100.00 per month starting from the date of the trial court's judgment [7].
