I. CAPTION
JIBIN ARULA v. BRIGADIER GENERAL ROMEO C. ESPINO, et al., G.R. No. L-28949, June 23, 1969, 28 SCRA 540, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jibin Arula was recruited for training on Corregidor Island. On March 18, 1968, a shooting incident occurred there, resulting in injuries to Arula. On March 23, Arula filed a criminal complaint for frustrated murder with the City Fiscal of Cavite against Capt. Soteco and other military personnel. The Fiscal issued subpoenas, and on April 3, military lawyers appeared requesting a postponement of the preliminary investigation.

Meanwhile, respondent General Espino, Commanding General of the Philippine Army, ordered a pre-trial investigation. He placed the accused under technical arrest (made retroactive to March 22). On April 6, Espino issued Special Order 208 convening a General Court-Martial (GCM), and charges for violation of Article of War 94 were filed. The GCM proceedings commenced on April 16. Arula filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition, arguing that the GCM lacked jurisdiction because the offense was committed outside a military reservation (claiming Corregidor was a national shrine) and that the civil courts had acquired jurisdiction first through the City Fiscal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Corregidor Island is a military reservation such that the General Court-Martial has jurisdiction over crimes committed therein.
2. W/N the General Court-Martial is barred from exercising jurisdiction because the complaint was first filed with the City Fiscal of Cavite.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that Corregidor Island remains a military reservation. Proclamation No. 69 (1948) declared Corregidor a military reservation. The subsequent Executive Order No. 58 (1954), which declared battlefield areas as national shrines, did not expressly or impliedly repeal Proclamation No. 69. Implied repeals are not favored. Furthermore, Article of War 94 confers upon courts-martial jurisdiction over persons subject to military law who commit felonies *inside* a reservation, concurrent with civil courts [1-3].

2. **NO.** While the civil courts and military courts have concurrent jurisdiction over the offense, the rule laid down in *Crisologo v. People* is that the court which first acquires jurisdiction over the *person* of the accused retains it to the exclusion of others. Jurisdiction is not acquired by the mere filing of a complaint with the Fiscal; it requires the filing of an information with the court and the arrest or voluntary submission of the accused [4, 5]. In this case, no information had been filed with the CFI of Cavite. Conversely, the GCM acquired jurisdiction because charges were preferred, and the accused were under strict military arrest and custody before the civil court could act [6].

Petition denied [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Fernando, J. (Concurring):** Petitioner lacks legal standing to challenge the President's power as Commander-in-Chief to maintain discipline. The military should be allowed to discipline its own personnel [8, 9].

**Dizon, J. (Dissenting):** The preliminary investigation by the Fiscal is a judicial proceeding. The military waived jurisdiction when its lawyers appeared before the Fiscal to ask for postponement. The military's subsequent convening of the court-martial was an undue interference with civil authority [10].

**Sanchez, J. (Dissenting):** Jurisdiction priority should be determined by who first takes official cognizance. The military waived priority by submitting to the Fiscal's authority. Civilian supremacy implies the Fiscal's investigation should take precedence [11, 12].
