I. CAPTION
ASUNCION ATILANO, et al. v. LADISLAO ATILANO and GREGORIO M. ATILANO, G.R. No. L-22487, May 21, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In 1920, Eulogio Atilano I subdivided his land (Lot No. 535) into five parts. He sold one portion to his brother, Eulogio Atilano II. The deed of sale stated that the lot sold was "Lot No. 535-E," while Eulogio I retained "Lot No. 535-A" [1]. Eulogio II and his successors (petitioners) occupied and built a house on Lot No. 535-A, while Eulogio I and his successors (respondents) occupied Lot No. 535-E [1, 2].

In 1959, the heirs of Eulogio II discovered the discrepancy after a resurvey. Finding that Lot No. 535-E (2,612 sq.m.) was significantly larger than Lot No. 535-A (1,808 sq.m.), they demanded possession of Lot No. 535-E based on the deed [2, 3]. The respondents refused, arguing the designation was an involuntary error and the intention was to convey the lot actually occupied (Lot A) [4]. The trial court ruled in favor of the petitioners, holding that registered land cannot be acquired by prescription [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the mistake in designating the lot numbers in the deed of sale vitiates the consent of the parties or invalidates the contract.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the mistake in designating the lot number does not vitiate the consent of the parties or affect the validity of the contract [6, 7]. The Court found that the object of the sale, as intended by the parties, was the specific portion where the vendee (Eulogio II) was already residing (Lot 535-A) [7].

The Court reasoned that when one sells or buys real property, one sells or buys the property "as he sees it, in its actual setting and by its physical metes and bounds, and not by the mere lot number assigned to it in the certificate of title" [8, 9]. Since there was a meeting of the minds but the instrument failed to express the true intention due to a mistake, the remedy is reformation of the instrument under Article 1359 of the Civil Code [10]. However, because the parties already retained possession of the properties corresponding to their real intention, there is no need for reformation; instead, they must execute mutual deeds of conveyance [10, 11].

The judgment of the lower court is **REVERSED**. The plaintiffs are ordered to execute a deed of conveyance of Lot No. 535-E in favor of the defendants, and the defendants are ordered to execute a similar document covering Lot No. 535-A in favor of the plaintiffs [12].
