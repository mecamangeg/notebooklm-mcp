**I. CAPTION**
ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ, et al. v. PERFECTO BURGOS, et al., G.R. No. L-28095, July 30, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondents spouses Burgos filed a forcible entry case against petitioners De la Cruz, et al. regarding a strip of land belonging to the Philippine National Railways (PNR) in Parañaque. The Municipal Court rendered a decision ordering petitioners to vacate the premises and pay monthly rentals [1]. Petitioners appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal (presided by Judge Bautista) as pauper litigants [2]. However, petitioners failed to file a supersedeas bond and failed to deposit the monthly rentals accruing during the appeal [2]. Consequently, respondents moved for the immediate execution of the judgment, which Judge Bautista granted [2]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, alleging grave abuse of discretion. They argued their failure to file the bond was due to "honest mistake" or "excusable negligence," believing they were relieved of the duty until the CFI fixed the amount, or because they were allowed to appeal as paupers [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the CFI Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in ordering the immediate execution of the judgment pending appeal due to the failure to file a supersedeas bond.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition [4]. The Court held that under Section 8, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court, if judgment is rendered against the defendant in a forcible entry case, execution shall issue immediately, unless an appeal is perfected AND the defendant files a sufficient supersedeas bond and pays the accruing rentals to stay execution [5]. The requirement of a supersedeas bond is mandatory and cannot be dispensed with by the courts [5]. When the bond is not filed, the duty of the court to order the execution of the appealed decision is ministerial and imperative [5].

The Court rejected the petitioners' defense of excusable negligence, noting that they never asked the Judge for time to file the bond before the writ was issued [6]. furthermore, it was undisputed that petitioners also failed to pay or deposit the monthly rentals that accrued during the pendency of the appeal [7]. Thus, the respondent Judge merely complied with his ministerial duty under the Rules of Court [7].

Accordingly, the petition is **DISMISSED** and the writ prayed for is **DENIED** [4].
