I. CAPTION
EDUARDO VIDAL and PABLO DE JESUS v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ROLANDO BELEN, EMILIO BONIFACIO, JUVENAL LEGASPI, TEODORO T. CALALANG, ANTONIO DOLOSON, ARCADIO ALON, LAUREANO CARACTA and BUENAVENTURA MAPANAO, G.R. No. L-29002, July 30, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Vidal and De Jesus were the incumbent President and Treasurer, respectively, of the Kapisanan ng Mga Manggagawa sa Perokaril. They sought re-election in March 1968 against respondents Belen and Bonifacio. A dispute arose regarding the conduct of the election, leading Belen to file Charge No. 2419 with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [1, 2]. The parties executed a compromise agreement stipulating that questioned ballots would be set aside and decided by the Election Committee if they could alter the results [3].

Despite Vidal and De Jesus questioning enough ballots to potentially affect the outcome, the Election Committee proclaimed Belen and Bonifacio the winners without ruling on the validity of the contested votes [4]. Petitioners filed a motion in Charge No. 2419 to nullify the proclamation and order a recanvass. However, before the CIR could resolve the motion, the winners took their oaths. Petitioners then filed this petition for Mandamus directly with the Supreme Court on May 9, 1968. Subsequently, on May 24, 1968, the CIR Presiding Judge Martinez dismissed Charge No. 2419. Petitioners did not seek reconsideration of this dismissal with the CIR *en banc* [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners can seek relief directly from the Supreme Court via Mandamus without first seeking reconsideration from the CIR *en banc*.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the action. It is well-settled that only an award, order, or decision of the Court of Industrial Relations *en banc* is appealable to the Supreme Court, not that of any of its individual judges. A decision or order of a single CIR judge cannot be reviewed directly [5].

The aggrieved party must first seek reconsideration by the CIR *en banc*. Even if the petitioners argued that the single judge had failed to act on their motion initially, the proper remedy was to seek relief from the CIR *en banc*, which has the implied power to stay or suspend the enforcement of a trial judge's order to prevent a reconsideration from becoming nugatory [6]. The failure to file a motion for reconsideration before the CIR *en banc* is fatal to the petition, citing *NAMARCO Employees v. Tabigne* and *Broce v. CIR* [5, 6].

Accordingly, the action for mandamus was **DISMISSED**, with costs against petitioners [7].
