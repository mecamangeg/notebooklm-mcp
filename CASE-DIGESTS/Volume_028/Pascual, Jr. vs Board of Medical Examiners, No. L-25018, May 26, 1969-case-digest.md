I. CAPTION
ARSENIO PASCUAL, JR. v. BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS, G.R. No. L-25018, May 26, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Arsenio Pascual, Jr. was the respondent in an administrative case for alleged immorality (malpractice) filed by the Gatbontons (Intervenors) before the respondent Board of Medical Examiners. At the initial hearing, the counsel for the complainants announced that they would present Pascual as their first witness [1]. Pascual objected, invoking his constitutional right against self-incrimination [1]. The Board noted the objection but ruled that he would be called to testify at the next hearing unless restrained by a competent court [1].

Pascual filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, arguing that the administrative proceeding was quasi-criminal in nature and compelling him to testify would violate his constitutional rights [2]. The Board argued that the right against self-incrimination is available only against specific incriminating questions once the witness is on the stand, not a right to refuse the stand entirely [3]. The CFI ruled in favor of Pascual, prohibiting the Board from compelling him to testify [4]. The Board and Intervenors appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a respondent in an administrative malpractice case can be compelled to take the witness stand as a witness for the prosecution.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. The Court reasoned that the constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination (Section 1, Clause 18, Art. III, 1935 Constitution) extends to administrative proceedings which possess a criminal or penal aspect [5]. A proceeding for malpractice is considered quasi-criminal because the respondent faces the possible revocation of his license as a medical practitioner, which is a deprivation of a livelihood and a penalty even greater than the forfeiture of property [6, 7].

Relying on the doctrine in *Cabal v. Kapunan*, the Court held that the accused in a criminal or quasi-criminal case has the right to refuse not only to answer incriminatory questions but also to take the witness stand altogether [4]. Compelling the respondent to testify against himself violates the right to silence and the respect accorded to human personality [8, 9]. The Board of Medical Examiners cannot, consistently with the self-incrimination clause, compel the person proceeded against to take the witness stand without his consent [10].

Accordingly, the decision of the lower court is affirmed [10].
