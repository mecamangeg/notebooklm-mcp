I. CAPTION
PRAXEDES LIMALIMA v. ALBERTO SANJURJO, UDK Administrative Case, June 14, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On December 12, 1956, Praxedes Limalima filed a verified complaint with the Supreme Court to prevent Alberto Sanjurjo from taking his oath as a member of the Philippine Bar, citing immorality and breach of promise to marry. Sanjurjo passed the 1956 bar examinations. However, due to an oversight, he was allowed to participate in the mass oath-taking on March 7, 1957, sign the roll of attorneys, and receive his certificate. Upon discovering the error, the Court required Sanjurjo to answer the complaint. Sanjurjo argued that the complaint should be dismissed as moot and academic because he had already taken his oath. He contended that the proper procedure should have been a disbarment proceeding. The case was referred to the Provincial Fiscal of Cebu, who found Sanjurjo guilty of acts of immorality unbecoming of a prospective bar member [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the proceedings initially filed to prevent the respondent from taking his oath may be treated as disbarment proceedings.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that there is nothing sacred in procedural forms. It is settled jurisprudence that technicalities, such as the one invoked by the respondent (dismissing the current case only to institute a separate disbarment proceeding), may be disregarded as long as the party concerned does not suffer substantial prejudice and is given his day in court [5, 6].

In this case, the respondent was afforded due process as he was able to answer the complaint and present evidence during the investigation by the Provincial Fiscal. Consequently, pursuant to Section 5, Rule 139 of the Rules of Court, the Solicitor General was directed to file the corresponding complaint against the respondent [6, 7].
