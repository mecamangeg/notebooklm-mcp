I. CAPTION
REV. FATHER LUCIO V. GARCIA v. HON. CONRADO M. VASQUEZ, G.R. No. L-26808, May 23, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rev. Father Lucio V. Garcia sought to probate the 1956 will of a decedent. Respondent Judge Conrado Vasquez ordered Garcia to pay a second docket fee of P940.00 on November 6, 1965, treating the petition as a separate action [1]. Garcia challenged this order, but the Supreme Court initially affirmed it in a decision dated March 28, 1969, reasoning that Garcia had filed a separate action rather than joining the probate in the pending proceeding [2]. Garcia filed a Motion for Reconsideration, clarifying that he did not file a separate action but expressly elected to file the probate of the 1956 will in the same Special Proceeding (Sp. Proc. 62618) already pending before the respondent court for the same decedent [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a separate docket fee is required for the probate of a second will of the same decedent when filed in the same pending special proceeding.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court granted the Motion for Reconsideration and set aside its previous decision [1]. It ruled that while the general rule requires payment of a docket fee before a court can act on a petition, this does not apply when a petitioner seeks to probate several wills of the same decedent and elects not to file a separate action, but instead seeks to probate the other will in the same special proceeding already pending [4], [3]. Since the petitioner successfully established that he filed within the existing Sp. Proc. 62618, the requirement for a second docket fee was improper [3]. The Order of November 6, 1965 was annulled, and the respondent was ordered to refund the P940.00 docket fee to the petitioner [1].
