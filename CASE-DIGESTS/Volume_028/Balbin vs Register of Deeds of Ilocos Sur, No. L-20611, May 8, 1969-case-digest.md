I. CAPTION
AURELIO BALBIN and FRANCISCO BALBIN v. REGISTER OF DEEDS OF ILOCOS SUR, G.R. No. L-20611, May 8, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On November 15, 1961, petitioners Aurelio and Francisco Balbin presented a Deed of Donation *inter-vivos* to the Register of Deeds of Ilocos Sur for annotation. The deed was executed by Cornelio Balbin, the registered owner of OCT No. 548, donating an undivided two-thirds portion of the land to the petitioners. They surrendered the owner's duplicate of the title. However, the Register of Deeds denied the registration because three separate "co-owner's duplicate certificates of title" had previously been issued to three different buyers (Florentino Gabayan, Roberto Bravo, and Juana Gabayan) who had purchased undivided portions of the same land [1-3]. The petitioners failed to present these three co-owner’s duplicates [3].

Petitioners appealed to the Commissioner of Land Registration, arguing that under Section 55 of Act 496 (Land Registration Act), the production of the owner's duplicate is conclusive authority for registration, and that the issuance of the co-owner’s copies was unauthorized [4]. The Commissioner upheld the Register of Deeds, ruling that all outstanding duplicates must be surrendered to ensure identical entries [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the registration of a voluntary instrument (Deed of Donation) may be refused if the petitioners fail to surrender the outstanding co-owner's duplicate certificates of title.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that where three co-owner's duplicate certificates of title are issued under Section 43 of Act 496, a voluntary instrument cannot be registered without surrendering all the copies of the same title to the Register of Deeds [6].

While Section 55 of Act 496 states that the production of the owner's duplicate is conclusive authority for registration, this provision assumes that only one duplicate copy of the title exists [7]. When multiple co-owner's duplicates are in existence, the law requires that every copy contain identical entries of transactions affecting the land [7]. If different copies were permitted to carry differing annotations, the integrity of the Torrens system would be compromised and cease to be reliable [8].

Furthermore, the petitioners' claim that the co-owner's copies were unauthorized is irrelevant to the administrative proceeding; their validity is presumed until declared otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction [7]. Finally, the donation was facially infirm because the donor (Cornelio Balbin) attempted to donate two-thirds of the property, which exceeded his presumptive one-half share in the conjugal partnership, especially considering he had already sold portions of the land to others [8].

The decisions of the Register of Deeds and the Commissioner of Land Registration are **AFFIRMED** [9, 10].
