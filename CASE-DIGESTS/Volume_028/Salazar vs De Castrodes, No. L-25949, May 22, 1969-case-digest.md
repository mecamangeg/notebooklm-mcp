I. CAPTION
BERNARDO O. SALAZAR v. MRS. EMILIANA LIBRES DE CASTRODES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25949, May 22, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Bernardo O. Salazar acquired a parcel of land in Guindulman, Bohol, on July 28, 1941, from Bienvenido C. Libres, the brother of the defendants [1]. Salazar possessed the land until 1960, when Bienvenido claimed ownership, leading Salazar to file Civil Case No. 1380 for recovery of ownership [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance (CFI) ruled in Salazar's favor, a decision later affirmed by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 32569-R, which declared the sale valid [2, 3]. However, when Salazar sought execution, the defendants (Bienvenido’s siblings) asserted that the land was part of their deceased father's intestate estate [2]. Salazar then filed the instant action to quiet title [4]. During the trial, the parties stipulated that they would be bound by the Court of Appeals' decision in the pending case between Salazar and Bienvenido [3, 5]. The CFI rendered judgment for Salazar, confirming his ownership [3]. Defendants appealed directly to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendants are bound by the Court of Appeals decision declaring Salazar the owner based on their stipulation.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the defendants are bound by the decision. The Court emphasized that during the trial, the defendants explicitly stipulated with the plaintiff that they "would be bound by the decision of the Court of Appeals in the other civil case filed by plaintiff against their brother" [5]. Since the Court of Appeals confirmed Salazar's ownership and the validity of the sale, the defendants' claim was rendered "totally bereft of any support in law" [3, 6]. Furthermore, the Court noted that appeals directly to the Supreme Court are limited to questions of law, and the defendants' attempt to raise factual matters or ignore their stipulation was improper [6, 7]. The Court condemned the appeal as a frivolous attempt to delay justice [8].

Decision affirmed with modification. Defendants are ordered to pay attorney's fees of P1,500.00. Treble costs are charged to the defendants, payable by their counsel, Attorney Lilio L. Amora [9].
