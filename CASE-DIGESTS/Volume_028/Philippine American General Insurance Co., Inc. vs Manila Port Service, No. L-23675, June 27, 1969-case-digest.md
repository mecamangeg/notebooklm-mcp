**I. CAPTION**
**PHILIPPINE AMERICAN GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANY, INC. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY**, G.R. No. L-23675, June 27, 1969, 128 Phil. 896, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
On August 5, 1962, the vessel "SS Streefkerk" arrived in Manila carrying 500 bags of white zirconium glaze and 2 bags of china clay consigned to Fil-Hispano Ceramics, Inc. On August 7, 1962, the cargo was discharged into the custody of Manila Port Service (MPS), the arrastre operator. Only 490 bags were delivered to the consignee, 31 of which were damaged. The Philippine American General Insurance Company, Inc. (Philamgen), as insurer, paid the consignee P1,428.00 for the loss. On August 13, 1962, within the 15-day period from discharge, Philamgen filed a "provisional" claim with MPS, advising of the short-landing and damage but without stating the exact value. A formal claim for P1,303.21 was later filed on January 15, 1963. MPS rejected the claim, arguing the provisional claim was speculative and the formal claim was filed out of time under Section 15 of the Management Contract. Philamgen sued in the Municipal Court and won; the Court of First Instance of Manila affirmed the decision. MPS appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the filing of a provisional claim without stating the exact value of the goods within the 15-day period constitutes substantial compliance with Section 15 of the Management Contract.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the presentation of a provisional claim within the prescribed 15-day period constitutes substantial compliance with Section 15 of the Management Contract, even if such claim does not state the exact value of the missing or damaged merchandise or is not supported by proper documents [1-3]. The rationale is that such a claim affords the arrastre operator a reasonable opportunity to check the validity of the demand while the facts are still fresh in the minds of the persons who took part in the transaction and pertinent papers are available [1-3]. Furthermore, any deficiency in the provisional claim was supplied by the subsequent formal claim filed on January 15, 1963 [4]. The Court affirmed the decision of the lower court [5].
