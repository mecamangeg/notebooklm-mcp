I. CAPTION
BASILIO ASIROT, ET AL. v. DOLORES LIM VDA. DE RODRIGUEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-26454, May 21, 1969, 28 SCRA 258 [implied], [Ponente not specified in source].

II. FACTS
Petitioners-tenants and respondents-landowners entered into a compromise agreement regarding their sharing basis (60-40), labor contributions, and loan extensions pending the determination of the leasehold system's constitutionality [1, 2]. The Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) approved this compromise on March 10, 1964, enjoining strict compliance [3].

On January 31, 1965, respondents moved for a writ of execution, alleging petitioners refused to comply with the decision. Petitioners opposed, claiming respondents had breached the contract first regarding transplanting expenses [3]. The CAR denied the motion for execution, ruling that the failure to comply constituted an independent cause of action requiring a separate suit. The CAR reasoned that enforcing the agreement via execution would require endless hearings to determine breaches [4]. Respondents appealed directly to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a judgment based on a compromise agreement can be enforced by a writ of execution without filing a separate action.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CAR's order. A judgment upon agreement of the parties has the force and effect of any other judgment and is more than a mere contract; therefore, it can be enforced by execution [6]. Article 2037 of the Civil Code prescribes that a compromise has the effect of *res judicata* upon the parties [5].

The Court held that if there is a dispute regarding a violation of the judgment's terms, the proper procedure is for the court to hear the parties and resolve whether execution should issue, not to require a separate action [6]. The CAR erroneously relied on *Co v. Lucero*, which actually established that a breach must be pleaded and proved within the same case, affording the adverse party a hearing, rather than filing a new suit [6, 7]. Requiring separate actions would lead to an "obnoxious multiplicity of suits" [8]. The court possesses inherent powers, including holding parties in contempt or placing property under receivership (Rule 39, Sec. 43), to prevent its decision from becoming a "dead letter" [8].

**Disposition:** Order reversed and set aside; case remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Fernando, and Capistrano concurred [9].
