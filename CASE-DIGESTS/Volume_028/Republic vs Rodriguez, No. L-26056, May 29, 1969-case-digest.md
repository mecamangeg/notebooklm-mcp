I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. JUDGE JESUS S. RODRIGUEZ and ROSARIO T. JALANDONI, G.R. No. L-26056, May 29, 1969, 28 SCRA 378, Reyes, J.B.L., Acting C.J.

II. FACTS
On March 12, 1965, the Republic filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo against Rosario T. Jalandoni to restrain her from taking possession of lots occupied by the Iloilo Normal School, to fix their fair value, and to cancel her titles. On August 31, 1965, the trial court dismissed the petition for failure to state a cause of action. The Republic filed a notice of appeal and a record on appeal. However, the trial court denied approval of the appeal, ruling that the case had become "moot and academic" because the property had allegedly already been purchased by the Republic in a negotiated sale approved in Jalandoni's intestate proceedings. The Republic filed a petition for mandamus, arguing that the trial court unlawfully excluded it from prosecuting the appeal, especially since the legality of the alleged sale was still being contested in a separate court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may dismiss a perfected appeal on the ground that the case has become moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court has no power to dismiss an appeal on the ground that it is moot or frivolous. Under Sections 13 and 14 of Rule 41 of the Revised Rules of Court, the *only* ground for a trial court to dismiss an appeal is the appellant's failure to file the notice of appeal, appeal bond, or record on appeal on time [1]. The only instance where a trial court may refuse an appeal despite procedural compliance is in pauper's appeals under Section 16 of Rule 41 [2].

By dismissing the appeal on the basis that the case was moot, the trial court effectively determined the merits of the appeal, which trenches upon the jurisdiction of the appellate courts [3]. Whether an appeal is frivolous or the case has become moot are questions that must be resolved by the appellate court, not the court *a quo*. Citing *Dosalla v. Caluag*, the Court reiterated that once the steps in Rule 41 are taken, it is the duty of the trial court to give due course to the appeal [4].

The petition was **GRANTED**, and the respondent court was ordered to approve and transmit the petitioner's record on appeal [5].
