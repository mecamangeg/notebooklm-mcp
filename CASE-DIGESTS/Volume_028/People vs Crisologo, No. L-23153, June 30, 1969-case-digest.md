I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JULIO CRISOLOGO, et al., defendants, ANTONIO TRINIDAD, defendant-appellant, G.R. No. L-23153, June 30, 1969, Barredo, J.

II. FACTS
On July 29, 1963, in Bucay, Abra, appellant Antonio Trinidad and co-accused Julio Crisologo were drinking with others at a store [1]. Crisologo became drunk and unruly. Later that evening, Claro Tejero and Jose Paligutan were killed. During the trial, Crisologo was allowed to change his plea to "guilty" for double homicide and confessed to being the sole killer of both victims [2, 3]. However, the prosecution presented a lone eyewitness, Flaviano Daquigan, who claimed he saw Trinidad stab Paligutan once after Crisologo had first stabbed him [4].

The Court of First Instance of Abra found Trinidad guilty of Murder for the death of Paligutan, sentencing him to *reclusión perpetua*, while finding Crisologo guilty of Homicide for Tejero and only slight physical injuries for Paligutan [5, 6]. Trinidad appealed the decision, challenging the credibility of the eyewitness and asserting that Crisologo’s confession should have been considered [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the guilt of appellant Antonio Trinidad for the crime of Murder was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court acquitted Trinidad because his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt. The Court found the testimony of the lone prosecution eyewitness, Daquigan, unreliable for several reasons:
1.  **Inconsistency:** Daquigan's testimony at trial contradicted his statement given to the Constabulary on the night of the incident [4].
2.  **Improbability:** It was dark, and the witness was five meters away. He claimed Crisologo stabbed the victim in the "throat," but the medical report showed the non-fatal wound was on the chest [8].
3.  **Medical Evidence:** The autopsy revealed the fatal wound was in the abdomen, while the chest wound (attributed by the witness to Crisologo) was non-fatal. The medical expert testified it was possible both wounds were caused by one weapon [8].

Furthermore, the Court held that the trial court erred in ignoring Crisologo's confession owning both killings. Since Crisologo pleaded guilty to double homicide without attempting to merely help Trinidad, his confession should have been weighed against the credibility of the lone eyewitness [3].

**Appellant Antonio Trinidad is ACQUITTED.**
