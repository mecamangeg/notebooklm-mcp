I. CAPTION
**GERMAN E. VILLANUEVA v. NATIONAL MARKETING CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-27441, June 30, 1969, Makalintal, J.**

II. FACTS
On November 25, 1965, the National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO) contracted to sell 10,000 metric tons of wire rod to German E. Villanueva (Viltra Company) for $1,320,000 [1]. Under the agreement, Villanueva would open a domestic letter of credit (L/C), and NAMARCO would open an irrevocable foreign L/C in favor of the supplier [1]. However, new NAMARCO management failed to open the foreign L/C despite initial assurances [2].

Villanueva filed a petition for Mandamus, which was later amended to a complaint for Specific Performance [3, 4]. NAMARCO filed its Answer to the amended complaint, raising defenses that Villanueva lacked legal capacity as he was not qualified under NAMARCO’s Administrative Order No. 16, and that the contract was void for being contrary to law [3, 5]. Villanueva moved to strike NAMARCO's Answer and moved for summary judgment, arguing no genuine issue existed [4, 6]. The Court of First Instance granted the motion to strike and rendered a partial summary judgment ordering NAMARCO to comply with the contract [6, 7]. NAMARCO appealed, contending it was deprived of the right to prove its defenses [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in striking out NAMARCO's answer to the amended complaint.
2. W/N summary judgment was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court should not have ordered the answer stricken out. Under Section 3 of Rule 11, if a complaint is amended, a new answer may be filed as a matter of right within 10 days [8]. NAMARCO filed its answer within the reglementary period [8]. Furthermore, there was a substantial change in the cause of action from Mandamus to Specific Performance, necessitating a new answer [8].

2. **NO.** Summary judgment was not justified because NAMARCO’s defenses tendered genuine factual issues that called for the presentation of evidence [9, 10]. Specifically, NAMARCO challenged Villanueva's legal capacity to enter the contract, alleging he did not meet the qualifications for trade assistance (e.g., being a duly accredited distributor or local manufacturer) required by Administrative Order No. 16 [10, 11]. These factual matters could not be resolved solely on the pleadings [9].

**Partial decision set aside and case remanded to lower court for further proceedings.**
