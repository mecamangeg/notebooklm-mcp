I. CAPTION
FERMIN SARE v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-22988, June 30, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Between October 1954 and March 1955, petitioner Fermin Sare imported various merchandise from Hong Kong into the Philippines. Seizure proceedings were instituted against the shipments for lack of Central Bank Release Certificates required by Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45, in relation to Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code. Sare secured the release of the goods by posting bonds in the aggregate amount of P78,311.57. The Respondent Commissioner of Customs subsequently ordered the confiscation of the bonds. On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals affirmed the forfeiture. Sare petitioned for review, arguing that the Circulars did not expressly prescribe forfeiture, the goods were not of "prohibited importation," and that Central Bank Circular No. 133 had repealed Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the imported goods are subject to forfeiture under Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code for violation of Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45.
2. W/N Central Bank Circular No. 133 repealed Circulars Nos. 44 and 45, rendering the forfeiture ineffectual.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that goods imported without the release certificates required by Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 are "merchandise of prohibited importation" as defined in Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code. Although the Circulars do not expressly provide for forfeiture, the Code explicitly prescribes forfeiture for merchandise imported contrary to law. Citing *Pascual v. Commissioner of Customs* and *Commissioner v. Serree Investment Co.*, the Court ruled that the Commissioner has the authority to seize and order the forfeiture of such goods [4-8].

2. **NO.** The Court rejected the theory that Central Bank Circular No. 133 repealed Circulars Nos. 44 and 45. Reaffirming its previous ruling in *Sare v. Aseron*, the Court held that paragraph 6 of Circular No. 133 in effect reiterated the requirement of a release certificate contained in the earlier circulars. Consequently, the violation of the requirement remained punishable by forfeiture [9].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED [10].
