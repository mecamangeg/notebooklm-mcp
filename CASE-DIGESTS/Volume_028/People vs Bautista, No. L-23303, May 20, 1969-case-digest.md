I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LEOCADIO BAUTISTA Y BASA, ET AL.**, G.R. Nos. L-23303 & L-23304, May 20, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On August 28, 1963, Filemon King (driver) and Jose Tan (helper) were in a delivery truck in Manila when appellant Fortunato Angeles and an unidentified man stepped on the running boards. Angeles demanded "liquor money" from King. When King refused, the unidentified man threw a stone at Tan, hitting the switch and stopping the truck. King and Tan alighted but were met with a volley of stones thrown by Angeles, appellant Armando Gonzales, co-accused Leocadio Bautista, and others [1]. King sustained severe skull fractures and died the following day [1, 2].

The Court of First Instance of Manila charged the accused with robbery with homicide. After a joint trial, the lower court found them guilty of **attempted robbery with homicide**, citing the aggravating circumstance of superior strength, and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua* [3, 4]. Gonzales and Angeles appealed, challenging the credibility of the prosecution witness and the finding of conspiracy [5-7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellants are liable for attempted robbery with homicide based on conspiracy.
2. W/N the mitigating circumstance of lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong applies.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the conviction, ruling that conspiracy was established by the concerted acts of the accused: stopping the truck, demanding money, and assaulting the victims upon refusal to pay [8]. Although only one person actually demanded money, the existence of conspiracy makes the act of one the act of all, rendering all companions equally guilty of the offense of attempted robbery with homicide [8, 9]. The Court also upheld the trial court's reliance on the testimony of the lone prosecution witness, Jose Tan, citing the trial judge's unique opportunity to observe witness demeanor [10, 11].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the mitigating circumstance of lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong could not be considered. The evidence showed that the attackers intended to cause death by throwing stones of such size and weight that they caused a skull fracture [12, 13]. Conversely, the Court appreciated the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength, as there were more than three attackers against the lone victim. Since this was not alleged in the information, it was treated only as a general aggravating circumstance [12, 14, 15].

The appealed decision was **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the indemnity to the heirs of the deceased was raised from P5,000 to P12,000 [15, 16].
