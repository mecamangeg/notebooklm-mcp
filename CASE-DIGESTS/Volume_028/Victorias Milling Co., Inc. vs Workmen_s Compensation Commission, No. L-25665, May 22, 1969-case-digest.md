I. CAPTION
VICTORIAS MILLING CO., INC. v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and JULIO SEGOVIA, G.R. No. L-25665, May 22, 1969, 28 SCRA 285, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Julio Segovia was employed by petitioner Victorias Milling Co. from 1952 until December 1957, when he was dismissed due to pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). His work involved carpentry, hauling logs, and constructing drydock walls, which exposed him to the elements and muddy water. On May 20, 1963, nearly six years after his dismissal, Segovia filed a claim for compensation. The WCC Regional Office sent a notice of the claim to the petitioner, which was received on June 17, 1963. The petitioner failed to answer or controvert the claim. Consequently, Segovia moved for a default judgment, which was granted. An *ex parte* hearing established the compensability of the illness. The WCC affirmed the Hearing Officer's award. Petitioner appealed, arguing it was denied due process because no summons was served, and that the claim was barred by prescription having been filed years after the statutory period.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner was denied due process due to the lack of service of summons.
2. W/N the claim is barred by prescription for being filed beyond the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Due process is identified with fairness or reasonableness. The petitioner admitted receiving the notice of claim by registered mail but failed to act. Under the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 3428), an employer is required to controvert a claim within 14 days of disability or 10 days after knowledge of the illness. The petitioner failed to file a notice of controversion. Citing *Filipino Pipe & Foundry Corp. v. Workmen's Compensation Commission*, the Court held that an employer who fails to controvert renounces its right to challenge the claim and cannot demand a day in court. The WCC rules requiring summons apply only to contested cases; uncontested claims do not require formal hearings [1, 2].

2. **NO.** While the claim was filed nearly six years after the employment ended, the petitioner's failure to controvert is fatal to this defense. The Court ruled that failure to controvert amounts to a waiver, renunciation, or forfeiture of the defense that the claim was not filed within the statutory period [3]. Citing *Pampanga Sugar Mills v. Vda. de Espeleta*, the Court affirmed that the non-controversion bars the employer from raising the defense of prescription.

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed.
