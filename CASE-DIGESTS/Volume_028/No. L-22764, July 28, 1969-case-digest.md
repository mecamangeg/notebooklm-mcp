**I. CAPTION**
CALTEX (PHILIPPINES), INC. v. THE CITY OF MANILA and MANUEL CUDIAMAT, in his capacity as City Treasurer, G.R. No. L-22764, July 28, 1969, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Caltex (Philippines), Inc. holds a refining concession to process crude oil into petroleum products at its refinery in Batangas [1]. It maintains a main office in Ermita, Manila, and warehouses in Pandacan, Manila [2]. The City of Manila assessed and collected taxes from Caltex under Ordinance No. 3420, which imposes a tax on wholesale dealers [1]. Caltex paid under protest, arguing it is a manufacturer, not a dealer.

Prior to 1958, Caltex sold products directly from its Pandacan warehouse. However, starting January 15, 1958, Caltex revised its procedure: customers could only place orders at the main office in Ermita, where sales were invoiced. The Pandacan warehouse was subsequently used solely for storage and delivery [2]. Caltex filed a suit for a refund. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Caltex, ordering the City Treasurer to refund the collected taxes [1]. The City appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Caltex is considered a "dealer" liable for the wholesale dealer's tax under Ordinance No. 3420.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that Caltex is a manufacturer and not a dealer [3, 4].

The Court defined a "dealer" as a middleman who buys to sell again, depending for profit on market skill rather than the labor bestowed on commodities [5]. A manufacturer is not a dealer unless it carries on the business of selling goods at a store or warehouse separate from its manufactory [3]. Citing *Central Azucarera Don Pedro v. City of Manila* and *Cebu Portland Cement Company v. City of Manila*, the Court ruled that where sales are perfected at the main office and the warehouse is used only as a delivery point, the manufacturer is not liable for the dealer's tax [5, 6]. The change in Caltex's procedure to centralize sales at the main office effectively removed it from the scope of the ordinance [7].

Decision affirmed [4].
