I. CAPTION
LEONORA T. ROXAS v. PEDRO DINGLASAN, FRANCISCA MOJICA and VICTORIA DINGLASAN, G.R. No. L-27234, May 30, 1969, 28 SCRA 430, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
Felisa Kalaw was the registered owner of a lot in Lipa City covered by TCT No. 9125. In June 1959, she sold portions of the lot to Intervenors Francisca Mojica and Victoria Dinglasan, who took possession but did not receive the owner's duplicate certificate of title. Consequently, they failed to register the sale [1].

Sometime prior to December 1961, Defendant Pedro Dinglasan falsified a public document to cancel Kalaw's title and secured TCT No. T-10392 in his own name [2]. On December 29, 1961, Pedro Dinglasan mortgaged the lot to Plaintiff Leonora T. Roxas for P7,000. Roxas, relying on Pedro’s clean title, registered the mortgage [2]. When Pedro defaulted, Roxas filed a foreclosure suit. Mojica and Victoria Dinglasan intervened, claiming ownership based on the earlier sale [2]. The Court of First Instance of Batangas ruled in favor of Roxas, ordering the foreclosure, holding that the Intervenors' claim of ownership could not prevail over the valid mortgage [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the mortgage is valid despite the mortgagor obtaining the title through fraud.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the mortgage was valid because Leonora T. Roxas was an innocent mortgagee for value [4]. Although Pedro Dinglasan was not the true owner, having acquired the title through fraud, the certificate of title was already in his name at the time of the mortgage. Roxas had the right to rely on what appeared on the face of the certificate, which showed the property was free from any objection [4].

The Court applied the principle of "innocent purchaser for value" to the mortgagee, citing *De Lara v. Ayrosa*, which holds that where a certificate of title is in the name of the forger when the land is sold to an innocent purchaser, the vendee is under no obligation to look beyond the certificate [4, 5]. Furthermore, under the Torrens System, it is the act of registration, not tradition, that transfers ownership [6]. Since the Intervenors failed to register their deeds of sale or file an adverse claim under Section 110 of Act No. 496, they were negligent, and this negligence was the proximate cause of their loss [7].

The judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED [8].
