**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JOSE LAVA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-4974 (Consolidated with L-4975, L-4976, L-4977, L-4978), May 16, 1969, 28 SCRA 72, Zaldivar, J.

**II. FACTS**
Jose Lava and his co-appellants were ranking leaders of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the *Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan* (HMB), formerly Hukbalahap. They were arrested in October 1950 during raids in Manila (the Politburo raids) and charged in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila with the complex crime of "rebellion with murders and arsons." The prosecution alleged that the accused conspired to overthrow the government through armed struggle, directing raids, ambushes, and killings committed by the HMB in various provinces from 1946 to 1950.

The CFI of Manila convicted the appellants of the *complex* crime of rebellion with multiple murder, arsons, and robberies. Several were sentenced to death, while others received *reclusion perpetua*. The appellants challenged the decision, arguing, among other things, that the crime of rebellion cannot be complexed with common crimes, that the information charged more than one offense, and that the Manila court lacked jurisdiction as the overt acts of violence occurred outside the city.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the crime of rebellion can be complexed with murder, arson, and robbery.
2. W/N the Anti-Subversion Law (R.A. 1700) is applicable to the case.
3. W/N the CFI of Manila had jurisdiction over the case.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court adhered to the ruling in *People v. Hernandez* (99 Phil. 515), holding that the crime of rebellion cannot be complexed with common crimes committed as a means to or in furtherance of the rebellion. Political crimes are directly aimed against the political order, and common crimes like murder and arson are absorbed by the crime of rebellion if committed to achieve a political purpose. The intent or motive is the decisive factor. Therefore, the accused can only be held liable for simple rebellion under Articles 134 and 135 of the Revised Penal Code.

2. **NO.** Republic Act No. 1700 (Anti-Subversion Act), which penalizes membership in subversive organizations, was approved on June 20, 1957. It cannot be applied retroactively to acts committed by the appellants between 1945 and 1950. Furthermore, the Act punishes participation in a subversive organization, which is distinct from the crime of actual rebellion charged in this case.

3. **YES.** Although the specific acts of violence (murders, arsons) were committed outside Manila, the information alleged that Manila was the "nerve center" where the accused decided and agreed to commit the rebellion and where they directed the HMB operations. Under the Rules of Court, criminal action may be instituted where any essential ingredient of the crime took place. Since the planning and direction—essential ingredients of rebellion—occurred in Manila, the CFI of Manila had valid jurisdiction.

The decision of the lower court is **MODIFIED**. The appellants are found guilty only of **Simple Rebellion**. The death penalties are reduced to imprisonment terms (mostly *prision mayor*), and the fines are adjusted accordingly.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
**Fernando, J., concurring:**
Justice Fernando emphasized the primacy of constitutional rights even when the offense charged is against the security of the State. He noted that the judiciary must remain the guardian of civil liberties, especially in times of emergency, to preserve faith in democracy.
