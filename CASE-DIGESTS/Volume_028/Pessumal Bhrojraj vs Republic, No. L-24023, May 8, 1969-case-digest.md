I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF PESSUMAL BHROJRAJ TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, PESSUMAL BHROJRAJ v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-24023, May 8, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pessumal Bhrojraj, born in India in 1897, immigrated to the Philippines in 1917 [1]. On September 18, 1961, he filed a petition for naturalization [1]. He did not file a declaration of intention, claiming exemption under Section 6 of the Revised Naturalization Law for having resided continuously in the Philippines for over 30 years [2, 3]. However, he admitted to visiting India four times (1919, 1923, 1938, and 1948), with each visit lasting five to seven months [3].

Regarding his income, Bhrojraj claimed to be a merchant with an average annual income of P6,000 [4]. His 1960 income tax return, however, showed a net income of only P2,097.43 [5]. He has a wife and four children, three of whom are studying [5]. He argued that his two elder sons provided him a monthly pension of P400, which should be added to his income [6]. The Court of First Instance of Surigao del Norte granted his petition [1]. The Republic appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a declaration of intention based on continuous residence.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petitioner is not exempt because his residence was not continuous. Under *Sy See v. Republic*, the petitioner’s four visits to India, lasting several months each, mean he "cannot be considered as having resided in the Philippines continuously as required by Section 5 of the Naturalization Act" [3]. Since he failed to file the mandatory declaration of intention without a valid exemption, the lower court acquired no jurisdiction over the petition, rendering the proceedings null and void [7, 8].

2. **NO.** The petitioner failed to prove he has a lucrative income. His documented net income of P2,097.43 is insufficient to support a wife and four children [5]. Even if his claimed average of P6,000 were accepted, it would still disqualify him [4]. Furthermore, the monthly pension from his children cannot be added to his income to make it lucrative because such assistance is "contingent, speculative, and precarious" [6, 9, 10]. Income for naturalization is gauged at the time of filing [11]. Even if the pension were included, raising the total to roughly P6,897.43, it remains insufficient given the high cost of living and the number of his dependents [6].

Accordingly, the judgment is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DISMISSED** [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Makalintal, J. concurred in the result [12].
