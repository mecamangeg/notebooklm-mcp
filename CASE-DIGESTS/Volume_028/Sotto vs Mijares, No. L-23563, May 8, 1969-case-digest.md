I. CAPTION
CRISTINA SOTTO v. HERNANI MIJARES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23563, May 8, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Cristina Sotto filed a case to foreclose a real estate mortgage against defendants Hernani Mijares, et al. for a P5,000.00 loan [1]. Sotto filed a "Motion for Deposit," asserting that the defendants admitted an indebtedness of P5,106.00 [1, 2]. The defendants expressed willingness to deposit the admitted amount, provided that Sotto cancel the mortgage and return the Transfer Certificates of Title [3]. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental ordered the defendants to deposit the P5,106.00 with the Clerk of Court within ten days, ignoring the condition regarding the cancellation of the mortgage [4, 5]. The defendants appealed the order, questioning the court's authority to compel the deposit [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may compel a debtor to deposit the amount of admitted indebtedness when the debtor imposes a condition for such deposit.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Supreme Court set aside the lower court's order, holding that the judge committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction [6, 7]. The Court reasoned that from the debtor's viewpoint, such a deposit is in the nature of consignation, which is a facultative remedy [6]. Citing **Article 1260 of the Civil Code**, the Court noted that since a debtor has the right to withdraw a deposit before the creditor accepts it or a judicial declaration is made, the debtor logically has the right to refuse to make the deposit in the first place [6, 8]. The Court emphasized that if a debtor refuses to deposit, they cannot be compelled to do so; instead, the creditor must rely on proper coercive processes provided by law, such as attachment or execution, to satisfy the credit [6]. The order appealed from was set aside [7].
