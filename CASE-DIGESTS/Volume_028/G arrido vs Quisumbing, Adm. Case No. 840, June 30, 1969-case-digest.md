**I. CAPTION**
JOAQUIN G. GARRIDO, CARLOS UY, JR., and FRANCISCO R. ACHACOSO v. NORBERTO QUISUMBING, Adm. Case No. 840, June 30, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners Garrido, Uy, and Achacoso sought the disbarment or suspension of respondent Atty. Norberto Quisumbing. The complaint arose after Quisumbing filed Civil Case No. 73668 in the Court of First Instance of Manila on behalf of several plaintiffs, including one L. Garcia Pastor [1, 2]. Petitioners alleged that Quisumbing committed malpractice because Garcia Pastor had not authorized him to institute said action [2].

In his defense, Quisumbing explained that he filed the complaint at the request of Julio Muñoz, a Spanish citizen and the controlling stockholder of the entities owning Capital Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. (Capital) [3, 4]. Muñoz informed Quisumbing that Garcia Pastor was merely his "alter ego" or nominee in the Board of Directors of Capital to qualify for a seat [4, 5]. Muñoz claimed he authorized the filing of the suit to stop the petitioners (officers of Capital) from mismanaging the company and fraudulently transferring assets [4]. Quisumbing argued he relied on Muñoz's representation of authority and acted swiftly due to the urgency of the relief sought [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Atty. Quisumbing committed legal malpractice or misconduct for filing a case on behalf of a plaintiff without that plaintiff's direct personal authorization.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court ruled that the respondent did not commit any act of malpractice [5].

The Court found that although Garcia Pastor did not personally authorize the respondent to file the case, Quisumbing had no reason to doubt the veracity of Muñoz's claim that he had the power to grant such authority [6]. The Court accepted the explanation that Muñoz was the controlling stockholder and that Garcia Pastor held shares merely as a nominee or alter ego [4, 6]. Furthermore, Garcia Pastor himself never complained against the respondent for the action taken [5]. Given the urgency to protect the assets of the corporation from alleged mismanagement, the respondent was justified in relying on the instructions of the beneficial owner, Muñoz [6].

The complaint for disbarment is **DISMISSED** [7].
