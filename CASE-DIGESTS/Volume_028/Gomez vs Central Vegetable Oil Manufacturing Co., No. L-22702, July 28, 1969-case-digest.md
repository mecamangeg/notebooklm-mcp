**I. CAPTION**
VICENTE A. GOMEZ v. CENTRAL VEGETABLE OIL MANUFACTURING COMPANY, G.R. No. L-22702, July 28, 1969, 28 SCRA 845, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Vicente A. Gomez was employed as a Plant Engineer by Central Vegetable Oil Manufacturing Company from 1938 until 1960 [1]. On February 13, 1960, he fell ill while working and stopped reporting for work upon a doctor's advice [2]. On October 25, 1960, Gomez filed a complaint claiming separation pay, unpaid salary, and attorney’s fees, alleging he was dismissed without cause [1].

While the case was pending, Gomez died on August 6, 1961 [3]. His widow, Alejandra S.J. Vda. de Gomez, attempted to substitute him as plaintiff [3, 4]. The defendant moved to dismiss, arguing the widow was not the legal representative as she had no court appointment and was not the sole heir (Gomez left six legitimate adult children and several illegitimate children) [4, 5].

The trial court dismissed the complaint, finding that Gomez was not dismissed but stopped working due to illness, and that the widow was not a proper legal representative [2, 6]. Gomez appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court on questions of law [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the employee is entitled to separation pay and unpaid salaries.
2. W/N the widow can be considered the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff under the Rules of Court.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that the employee is not entitled to separation pay because his employment was terminated due to his death and illness, not by an act of the employer dismissing him [7]. The Court distinguished this from cases where dismissal was undisputed, noting here that Gomez simply stopped working for medical treatment [7]. Regarding unpaid salaries, the claim was denied because Gomez did not render service during the period claimed. While he might have been entitled to sick leave with pay, no proof of his right to such leave or the amount of leave credits was presented [8].

2. **NO.** The widow cannot be considered the legal representative under Section 17, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court [5]. She was not appointed by any court as executrix or administratrix of the estate [5]. Furthermore, she was not the sole heir, as the deceased was survived by six legitimate adult children and several illegitimate children [5].

**Disposition:** The decision appealed from is affirmed.
