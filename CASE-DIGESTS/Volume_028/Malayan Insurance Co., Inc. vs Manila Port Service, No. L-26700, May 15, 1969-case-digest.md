I. CAPTION
MALAYAN INSURANCE CO., INC. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD CO., G.R. No. L-26700, May 15, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Malayan Insurance Co., Inc. (plaintiff), as subrogee of several consignees, filed a suit for recovery of money against Manila Port Service (MPS) and Manila Railroad Co. (defendants) for short delivery and pilferage of goods across four importations from the United States and Japan between 1961 and 1962. The parties stipulated that the goods were discharged complete into the custody of MPS. MPS denied liability, arguing there was no proof of its negligence and that the claims were not filed within the 15-day period from the "date of discharge of the last package" as required by the Management Contract, since the date of last discharge was not proven.

The City Court of Manila ruled in favor of Malayan Insurance. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Manila affirmed the decision, ordering MPS to pay P1,447.51 with legal interest from the date the complaint was filed, plus attorney's fees. MPS appealed to the Supreme Court on points of law, questioning its liability, the sufficiency of the provisional claims, and the computation of interest.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N MPS is liable for the loss and pilferage of the goods.
2. W/N the provisional claims filed within 15 days of the vessel's arrival constitute substantial compliance with the Management Contract.
3. W/N legal interest should be computed from the date of the filing of the complaint.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Article 1265 of the Civil Code, whenever a thing is lost in the possession of the debtor, it shall be presumed that the loss was due to his fault, unless there is proof to the contrary [1]. As the custodian of goods discharged from the vessel, the arrastre operator (MPS) has the duty to take good care of them [2]. Since MPS admitted receiving the goods complete and failed to prove that the losses occurred without its fault or due to *caso fortuito*, it is liable for the shortage and pilferage [3].

2. **YES.** While there was no proof of the specific date of discharge of the last package, the provisional claims were filed within the 15-day period following the *arrival* of the carrying vessels [3]. The Court held that a provisional claim filed within 15 days from the vessel's arrival is substantial compliance with the requirement to file a claim within 15 days from the date of discharge of the last package, even if the claim does not specify the value or lack supporting papers [3, 4].

3. **NO.** The claim was unliquidated because the amount demanded in the complaint (P3,947.20) was not established in its totality and the plaintiff eventually stipulated to a much lower amount (P1,447.51) [5]. Under Article 2213 of the Civil Code, interest cannot be recovered upon unliquidated claims until they are reasonably established [6]. Following the ruling in *Rivera v. Perez*, interest on unliquidated damages determined by the court must be counted from the date of the decision, not the date of judicial demand [5, 6].

The judgment of the lower court is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that the interest shall commence from the date of the decision below.
