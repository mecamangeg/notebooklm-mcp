I. CAPTION
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-26979, May 29, 1969, Teehankee, J.

II. FACTS
The Insurance Company of North America, as subrogee of the importer Yucuanseh Drug Co., Inc., filed a complaint against the Republic of the Philippines to recover P2,167.02. This amount represented the insurance value of one carton of medicines lost while in the custody of the Customs Arrastre Service, which was operated by the Republic through the Bureau of Customs [1]. The City Court of Manila rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff on March 31, 1965 [1]. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Manila affirmed the decision on July 5, 1966, rejecting the Republic's defense of immunity from suit [1]. The Republic appealed to the Supreme Court on a question of law [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Republic of the Philippines is immune from suit regarding its operation of the arrastre service.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The State cannot be sued without its consent [2]. The Bureau of Customs is part of the Department of Finance and possesses no personality separate from the national government [3]. Its primary function of assessing and collecting revenues is governmental, and the operation of the arrastre service is a "necessary incident" to this function [3]. Even if the arrastre function were deemed proprietary, it does not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity because it is indispensable to the performance of the Bureau's governmental duties [3], [2]. The Court applied the doctrine established in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service* (18 SCRA 1120) [4], [5]. The proper remedy for the plaintiff is to file a money claim with the General Auditing Office in accordance with Commonwealth Act No. 327 [2].

Accordingly, the judgment appealed from is **REVERSED** and the complaint is **DISMISSED** [6].
