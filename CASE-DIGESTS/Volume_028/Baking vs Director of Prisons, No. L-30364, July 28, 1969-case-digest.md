I. CAPTION
ANGEL C. BAKING and SIMEON G. RODRIGUEZ v. THE DIRECTOR OF PRISONS (consolidated with *In the Matter of the Application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus, Jose Lava, et al.*), G.R. Nos. L-30364 and L-30603, July 28, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Angel Baking, Simeon Rodriguez, Jose Lava, and others had been detained for over 18 years pending the resolution of their criminal cases [1]. On May 16, 1969, the Supreme Court in *People v. Lava* convicted them of rebellion and sentenced them to 10 years imprisonment [1]. Petitioners filed petitions for habeas corpus, arguing they should be released because they had already served their sentences [2]. They contended that under Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), they were credited with one-half of their preventive imprisonment (over 9 years) [2]. To cover the remainder of the 10-year sentence, they invoked Article 97 of the RPC, claiming they were entitled to Good Conduct Time Allowance (GCTA) for the entire period of their detention [3]. The Respondent Director of Prisons opposed the application of Article 97 to detention prisoners [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Article 97 of the Revised Penal Code (allowance for good conduct) applies to detention prisoners.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that Article 97 applies only to prisoners serving a sentence by final judgment, not detention prisoners. While the English text of Article 97 uses the term "any prisoner," the Spanish text—which is controlling—uses the term *"el penado"* [4, 5]. *"El penado"* refers to a convict or a *"delincuente condenado a una pena"* (delinquent condemned to a penalty) [5]. Furthermore, Article 97 states deductions are made from "the period of his sentence" (*"del tiempo de su condena"*), implying a final judgment [6].

Harmonizing the Code, Article 94(3) of the RPC specifies that good conduct allowances are for culprits *"while he is serving his sentence"* [7, 8]. Detention prisoners are not yet serving a sentence [8]. The Court noted that the *sole* exception is found in Section 5 of Act 1533, which grants credit to detention prisoners who voluntarily offer in writing to perform assigned labor [9]. Petitioners failed to show they met this condition [10]. Consequently, the petitions were DENIED [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Fernando, J. (Dissenting):**
Justice Fernando argued that the continued detention of petitioners for over 18 years, when their final sentence was only 10 years, constituted a grave infraction of the due process clause [12, 13]. He contended that the distinction between preventive detention and imprisonment after judgment is insignificant to the person deprived of liberty [13]. He asserted that Article 29 of the RPC (crediting only half of preventive imprisonment) should be declared inapplicable or inoperative in this case as it is repugnant to the constitutional mandate of due process and equal protection [14].
