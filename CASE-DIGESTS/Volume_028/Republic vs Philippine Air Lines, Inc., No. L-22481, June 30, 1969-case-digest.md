I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PHILIPPINE AIR LINES, INC., G.R. No. L-22481, June 30, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On June 23, 1961, the Republic of the Philippines filed a complaint against Philippine Air Lines, Inc. (PAL) to recover P1,357,686.14 in unpaid air navigation fees incurred between 1947 and 1950 [1]. On December 23, 1963, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila decided in favor of the Republic, ordering PAL to pay the full amount with interest [2]. PAL appealed the decision to the Supreme Court [3].

While the appeal was pending, on June 14, 1969, the parties submitted a "Joint Petition for Judgment in Accordance with Agreement" [4]. They executed a Compromise Agreement wherein PAL agreed to pay the principal sum of P1,357,686.14 in installments [5]. The agreement expressly stated that it "novates and supersedes" the judgment rendered by the CFI [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the compromise agreement supersedes and novates the judgment of the trial court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court approved the compromise agreement submitted by the parties. The Court reasoned that since the parties arrived at an amicable settlement and expressly agreed that said agreement "shall supersede and novate the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila... from which the defendant-appellant appealed," the agreement is binding [7, 8].

Accordingly, the parties were enjoined to comply strictly with the terms of the compromise. The decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 47365 was deemed superseded and of no further force and effect [7, 9].
