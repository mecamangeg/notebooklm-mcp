**I. CAPTION**
**JESUS GANCHERO v. HON. ANACLETO BELLOSILLO**, G.R. No. L-26340, June 30, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Jesus Ganchero was charged with Bigamy in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo, presided by Respondent Judge Anacleto Bellosillo. The Information alleged that Ganchero contracted a first marriage in Iloilo City and, while that marriage was subsisting, contracted a second marriage in Davao [1]. Ganchero moved to quash the information, arguing that the CFI of Iloilo lacked jurisdiction because the venue was improperly laid; the crime of bigamy was committed in Davao where the second marriage took place [2]. The Respondent Judge denied the motion, reasoning that the first marriage in Iloilo was an essential ingredient of the crime, making it triable in Iloilo [3]. Ganchero filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court to set aside the order [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance of Iloilo has jurisdiction to try a bigamy case where the first marriage occurred in Iloilo but the second marriage was celebrated in Davao.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the CFI of Iloilo is devoid of jurisdiction. In criminal prosecutions, the action must be instituted and tried in the municipality or province where the offense or any of its essential ingredients was committed (Rule 110, Sec. 14(a), Revised Rules of Court) [5].

The crime of bigamy is committed upon the celebration of the subsequent marriage, not before. The place of the first marriage is immaterial to the criminal act and intent; what is essential is merely that the first marriage be not legally terminated when the subsequent wedlock takes place [6]. While crimes committed partly in one province and partly in another are triable in either, this applies only where acts "material and essential to the crime and requisite to its consummation" occur in different provinces (*U.S. v. Santiago*) [3]. To consider the first marriage an essential ingredient of the crime for venue purposes would imply a "continuous crime," requiring a unity of criminal intent (i.e., that the accused married the first wife with the specific intent to later marry the second), which cannot be assumed (*People v. Zapata*) [5, 7]. Since the second marriage occurred in Davao, the crime was committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Iloilo court [5, 6].

The writ of certiorari was **GRANTED**, the order denying the motion to quash was **SET ASIDE**, and the case was ordered **DISMISSED** [8].
