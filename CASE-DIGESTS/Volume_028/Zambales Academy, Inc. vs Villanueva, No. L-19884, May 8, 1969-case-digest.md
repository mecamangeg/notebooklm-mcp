I. CAPTION
ZAMBALES ACADEMY, INC. v. CIRIACO VILLANUEVA, G.R. No. L-19884, May 8, 1969, Teehankee, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellant Zambales Academy, Inc. previously sued defendant-appellee Ciriaco Villanueva in Civil Case No. 1760 for damages alleging abuse of trust. Villanueva filed a counterclaim, which Zambales Academy failed to answer, resulting in a default order and a judgment awarding damages to Villanueva [1, 2]. Zambales Academy challenged the execution of this judgment through a petition for certiorari, which reached the Supreme Court in *Zambales Colleges, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. L-16371) [3]. In that case, the Court upheld the trial court’s jurisdiction and the default judgment regarding the first and third causes of action [4, 5].

Subsequently, Zambales Academy filed a new complaint (Civil Case No. 2386) to annul the judgment in Civil Case No. 1760, arguing that the award was unsupported by evidence and that it was declared in default due to the "deception and betrayal" of its counsel [6]. The trial court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the validity of the judgment had already been passed upon by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-16371 and was barred by prior judgment [7]. Zambales Academy appealed, insisting the trial court lacked "power and authority" to award damages without evidence [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action for annulment of judgment is barred by *res judicata*.
2. W/N the alleged deception and betrayal by counsel is a valid ground for annulment of judgment.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the appellant is barred from relitigating the same issue. The appellant’s contention regarding the trial court's lack of power to award damages was already resolved in the final decision of G.R. No. L-16371 [9]. In that prior decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the trial court's exercise of discretion was not whimsical or amounting to a lack of jurisdiction [9]. Public policy and the principle of *res judicata* dictate that parties should not be permitted to litigate the same issue more than once [10]. The Court emphasized that a change in the form of action—from a petition for certiorari to an action for annulment—does not prevent the application of *res judicata* where the parties are in truth litigating for the same thing [11].

2. **NO.** The Court affirmed the lower court's ruling that the allegation of deception and betrayal by counsel constitutes intrinsic fraud, which is not a ground for annulment of judgment [12, 13]. The appellant acknowledged that this allegation was made only to explain its default and not as a substantive ground for nullity [13]. If true, the appellant's recourse is the proper administrative and legal action against its counsel, not the annulment of the judgment [13].

**Judgment affirmed.** [14]
