I. CAPTION
BENJAMIN A. GRAY v. JACOBO S. DE VERA, ENRIQUE J.L. RUIZ, MANUEL T. LEELIN, SERGIO ORTIZ LUIZ, SALUD V. PARREÑO, PEDRO FERNANDEZ and TEOFILO DEL CASTILLO, G.R. No. L-23966, May 22, 1969, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Benjamin A. Gray held a permanent appointment as Board Secretary of the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC). On January 12, 1959, he sent a telegram to President Carlos P. Garcia suggesting a revamp of the PHHC Board due to mismanagement and misconduct. The following day, the Board passed Resolution No. 331 terminating Gray's services effective immediately for "loss of confidence" due to alleged treachery and disloyalty, and Resolution No. 332 designating respondent Jacobo S. De Vera as Acting Secretary. Gray filed a complaint for *quo warranto* and damages in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, alleging illegal removal without cause and due process. The defendants argued that Gray's position was "primarily confidential" under Executive Order No. 399, thus excluding him from Civil Service protection against removal. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that the telegram constituted treachery justifying removal from a confidential position. Gray appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a permanent incumbent of a "primarily confidential" position may be removed summarily for loss of confidence.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to moral damages and attorney's fees.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A position declared "primarily confidential" still falls within the purview of Section 4, Article XII of the Constitution, which mandates that no officer or employee in the Civil Service shall be removed or suspended except for cause as provided by law. The constitutional exception for confidential positions relates only to the manner of appointment (exempt from competitive examination), not to security of tenure. Gray's act of sending the telegram was a privileged communication and an act of civic duty in the interest of good government, not treachery. Furthermore, Gray was removed summarily without a formal charge or hearing, violating his right to due process.

2. **NO** (as to moral damages) and **YES** (as to attorney's fees). Moral damages cannot be recovered where the action is brought against defendants in their official capacity. However, the claim for P2,000.00 in attorney's fees is reasonable given the legal questions involved and services rendered.

**ACCORDINGLY**, the judgment is REVERSED. The Board is ordered to reinstate Gray with full back wages from January 14, 1959, and to pay P2,000.00 as attorney's fees.
