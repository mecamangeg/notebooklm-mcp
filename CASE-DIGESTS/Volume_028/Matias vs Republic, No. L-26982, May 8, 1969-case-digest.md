**I. CAPTION**
ROSALINDA MATIAS v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-26982, May 8, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., Acting C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Rosalinda Matias filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Rizal to insert her name in her birth certificate, which had been left blank due to an oversight. This gap was discovered when she applied as an exchange student [1]. The petition was published by posting copies in the provincial capitol and municipal building for two weeks, and served upon the Solicitor General and the Civil Registrar [2]. The Republic opposed the petition, arguing that under Article 412 of the Civil Code, only clerical errors may be corrected, and the supplying of a missing name is a material amendment [2]. The lower court granted the petition, and the Solicitor General appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the insertion of the petitioner's name in the civil registry may be done by judicial order.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that the name of a child may be supplied later if left blank at the time of registration. The birth certificate form itself contains instructions for a "supplemental report" if the child is not yet named [4]. If a name can be recorded subsequently via a supplemental report, it can also be done via a judicial order after a proper hearing [4].

Furthermore, the Court distinguished this case from the doctrine in *Ty Kong Tin v. Republic*, which forbids material corrections in the civil registry via summary proceedings. The Court held that the proceedings here were not summary because there was publication and service of notice to interested parties, including the Solicitor General [5]. Since the truth of the petitioner's allegations was established and no prejudice would be caused to third parties, the correction is permissible [5].

The decision of the Court of First Instance is **AFFIRMED** [6].
