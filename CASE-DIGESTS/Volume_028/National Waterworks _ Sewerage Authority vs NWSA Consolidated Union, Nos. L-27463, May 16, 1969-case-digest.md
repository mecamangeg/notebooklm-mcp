I. CAPTION
NATIONAL WATERWORKS & SEWERAGE AUTHORITY v. NWSA CONSOLIDATED UNION, JESUS CENTENO, ET AL., and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-27463, May 16, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On January 16, 1961, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) awarded additional compensation to intervenors (Jesus Centeno et al.) for overtime, nighttime, Sunday, and holiday work. This ruling was affirmed by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-18938, establishing NAWASA's liability based on its collective bargaining agreement (CBA). To implement the award, the CIR issued an order on October 5, 1964, directing the Court Examiner to compute the claims and requiring parties to file objections to the report within 20 days of receipt, warning that failure to do so would render the report final.

The Examiner submitted the Sixth Partial Report on March 26, 1966. NAWASA received it on April 4, 1966. Instead of filing an objection, NAWASA filed a "Motion for Bill of Particulars" on April 19, 1966, claiming the report was indefinite. NAWASA finally filed its objection on June 3, 1966. The CIR disregarded the objection as filed out of time and issued an order on February 20, 1967, approving the report and directing NAWASA to deposit P99,332.21. NAWASA appealed, arguing its motion suspended the period to file objections and reiterating that it should not be liable for Sunday premiums as a public utility and for overtime without written authority.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the filing of a Motion for Bill of Particulars suspended the 20-day period to file objections to the Examiner's report.
2. W/N NAWASA is liable for Sunday/holiday differentials and overtime pay despite the lack of written authorization.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The motion did not suspend the period because it was resort to for the purpose of delaying the proceedings and was without merit. The information sought was already available in the report's appendices [1]. While the Rules of Court allow such motions to suspend time, they are merely suppletory to the CIR’s Rules of Procedure [2]. The CIR expressly ordered that objections be filed within 20 days to prevent further delay in a case pending for years. The CIR correctly disregarded the pleading which violated its order [3]. NAWASA's objection filed on June 3 was long past the deadline [3].

2. **YES.** The Court held that these issues were already settled by the "law of the case" in previous decisions (G.R. L-18938 and L-26894-96) involving the same parties and issues [4, 5]. While Commonwealth Act No. 444 does not strictly require public utilities to pay Sunday/holiday premiums, NAWASA is liable because it voluntarily assumed this obligation under its CBA [6, 7]. The lack of written authorization from the General Manager does not excuse the public utility from complying with its contractual obligations [8, 9].

The orders appealed from are AFFIRMED.
