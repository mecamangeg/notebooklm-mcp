I. CAPTION
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, petitioner, vs. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and ROSARIO MARTIN VDA. DE MALLARI, respondents., G.R. No. L-27692, May 30, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Milagros Mallari was employed by the National Development Company (NDC) as a weaver. She was afflicted with pulmonary tuberculosis and was separated from the service on December 21, 1951, receiving the corresponding gratuity [1]. She died on July 12, 1953, almost two years after her separation from NDC [2]. Her mother, respondent Rosario Martin Vda. de Mallari, filed a claim for compensation with the Department of Labor on January 25, 1963, more than nine years after the death [2], [3]. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded death benefits, ruling that although the claim was filed late, NDC failed to controvert it and thereby waived its defenses by operation of law [3]. NDC appealed, arguing the claim was time-barred under Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 3428) [1], [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the claim for compensation is barred by prescription despite the employer's failure to file a notice of controversion.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the claim was barred. While failure to controvert generally constitutes an implied waiver of defenses (including prescription), such waiver presupposes that the employer had knowledge of the sickness, injury, or death upon which the claim is predicated [4]. In this case, the employee died almost two years after leaving the service, so knowledge of her death could not be presumed from the employer-employee relationship [4].

Section 24 of Act No. 3428 requires a claim for compensation to be made within two months of sickness or three months of death [2]. These periods are fixed to prevent stale claims and ensure the employer has a reasonable opportunity to investigate while facts are accessible [5]. The Court found it unfair to accord credence to the claimant's unsupported testimony of verbal notice given the lapse of over nine years before the formal filing [5], [6].

The decision appealed from is reversed and set aside [7].
