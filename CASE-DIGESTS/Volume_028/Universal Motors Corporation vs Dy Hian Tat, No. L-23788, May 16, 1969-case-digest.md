**I. CAPTION**
**UNIVERSAL MOTORS CORPORATION v. DY HIAN TAT, et al.**, G.R. No. L-23788, May 16, 1969, 28 SCRA 161, Barredo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Defendant-appellant Dy Hian Tat purchased a Mercedes-Benz Diesel truck from plaintiff-appellee Universal Motors Corporation (UMC) on an installment basis [1]. Dy Hian Tat defaulted on his payments [1]. Consequently, UMC filed a complaint for replevin to recover possession of the truck or, alternatively, to collect the sum of P37,221.22 plus attorney's fees [1]. The trial court issued a writ of replevin, and UMC successfully recovered possession of the vehicle [2].

The Court of First Instance of Manila decided the case on a stipulation of facts, adjudging that UMC had the right of possession and title to the truck. It further ordered Dy Hian Tat to pay P9,305.30 as attorney's fees and costs of collection, calculated at 25% of the indebtedness as stipulated in the chattel mortgage [3, 4]. Dy Hian Tat appealed, arguing that under Article 1484 of the Civil Code (Recto Law), UMC’s recovery of the mortgaged truck constituted a foreclosure, thereby barring any further recovery of money, including attorney's fees [5-7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the award of attorney's fees is proper despite the vendor recovering possession of the mortgaged personal property via replevin.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court.

The Court ruled that Article 1484 of the Civil Code is not applicable because the action instituted was for replevin under Rule 60, not for the foreclosure of a chattel mortgage under Rule 68 [8]. The mere fact that the vendor (UMC) secured possession of the mortgaged truck does not equate to foreclosure [9]. For the prohibition against further collection under Article 1484 (Recto Law) to apply, there must be an actual foreclosure sale [10]. The Court held that "foreclosure" implies the full procedure including the sale of the mortgaged property at public auction [11]. Since UMC did not sell the truck at public auction, it did not foreclose the mortgage and was not barred from recovering the stipulated attorney's fees [11, 12].

Furthermore, the attorney's fees awarded were in the nature of liquidated damages (Art. 2226, Civil Code). Since the appellant did not claim they were iniquitous or unconscionable, no proof of actual expenses was required [13].

**Judgment affirmed.**
