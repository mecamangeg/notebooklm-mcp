I. CAPTION
J. P. JUAN & SONS, INC. v. LIANGA INDUSTRIES, INC., G.R. No. L-25137, July 28, 1969, 28 SCRA 807, Teehankee, J.

II. FACTS
On October 30, 1963, petitioner J. P. Juan & Sons, Inc. filed a complaint in the City Court of Manila to recover P900.00 from respondent Lianga Industries, Inc., representing the unpaid balance of office equipment sold and delivered on October 15, 1962. A copy of the purchase order was attached to the complaint. The City Court ruled in favor of the petitioner [1].

The respondent appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. In its Answer, the respondent "specifically denied" the material allegations regarding the purchase and refusal to pay, claiming it had "no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief," and raised a defense that it had no obligation to pay. However, the respondent failed to deny under oath the authenticity of the attached purchase order [1]. The petitioner moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing the answer failed to tender an issue. The CFI granted the motion, ruling that the matters alleged were within the respondent's knowledge and could not be effectively denied by a claim of ignorance [2]. The respondent appealed to the Supreme Court on a question of law [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N judgment on the pleadings was proper on the ground that the respondent's answer failed to tender an issue.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the respondent's "specific denials" were effectively general denials that admitted the material allegations of the complaint [4].

The Court applied **Rule 8, Section 10 of the Revised Rules of Court**, which requires a defendant to specify each material allegation not admitted and set forth the substance of the matters relied upon to support the denial [5]. An unexplained denial of information and belief regarding a matter of record or facts plainly within the pleader's knowledge is evasive and insufficient to constitute an effective denial (*Warner Barnes & Co. v. Reyes*) [6]. Since the respondent could not logically pretend ignorance about its own purchase of equipment, its answer failed to tender an issue [7].

Furthermore, under **Rule 8, Section 8**, the respondent's failure to deny under oath the authenticity of the purchase order attached to the complaint was deemed an admission of its genuineness and due execution [7, 8]. Consequently, judgment on the pleadings was proper under **Rule 19, Section 1** [5].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [9].
