I. CAPTION
MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. COURT OF APPEALS and ALFONSO DE LA PAZ, G.R. No. L-22986, July 29, 1969, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Alfonso de la Paz, a returning resident, shipped a tractor with attachments from the United States to Manila on board the *SS Fernpoint*. The vessel arrived on July 6, 1960, and the cargo was unloaded on July 7, 1960, with the Manila Port Service (MPS) receiving checker signing a bad cargo receipt. The cargo was subsequently lost while in the custody of MPS. De la Paz's broker paid P15.19 in arrastre charges and filed a provisional claim on July 21, 1960, within the 15-day period prescribed by the management contract. A formal claim was filed later on August 16, 1960.

MPS refused to pay, prompting De la Paz to file suit. The Court of First Instance ordered MPS to pay P4,556.90 (the manifested value) plus damages. The Court of Appeals modified the judgment by eliminating moral and exemplary damages but affirmed the award for the value of the lost cargo. MPS appealed, arguing that the provisional claim was invalid for failing to state the value of the goods and that its liability should be limited to P500.00 per package under the management contract [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the provisional claim was valid despite failing to state the value of the goods.
2. W/N the arrastre operator's liability is limited to P500.00 per package.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The provisional claim filed within the 15-day period is valid. Paragraph 15 of the management contract does not require the value of the goods to be stated in the claim. A provisional claim is sufficient if it describes the goods well enough to permit identification by the operator and determination of relevant facts, such as the vessel name and bill of lading. The Court relied on *Filipro, Inc. v. Manila Port Service* and *Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company v. Manila Port Service* to sustain the sufficiency of the claim [5, 6].

2. **NO.** The liability is not limited to P500.00 because the value was "otherwise specified." Paragraph 15 limits liability to P500.00 "unless the value is otherwise specified or manifested." The Court held that specifying the actual value in customs documents, such as the import entry and internal revenue declaration, satisfies this requirement. Since De la Paz declared the value in these documents and paid the arrastre charges required of him by MPS, the petitioner is liable for the full manifested value of P4,556.90. The Court cited *Northern Motors, Inc. v. Prince Line* and *Jose Bernabe & Co., Inc. v. Delgado Brothers, Inc.* [7-10].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [11].
