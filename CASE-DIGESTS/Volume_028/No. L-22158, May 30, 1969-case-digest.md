I. CAPTION
REV. CIPRIANO YTURRALDE (deceased), substituted by NENITA YTURRALDE v. DR. RAYMUNDO AZURIN, DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES and REGISTER OF DEEDS OF ANTIQUE, G.R. No. L-22158, May 30, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On December 10, 1955, Carmen Yturralde executed a notarial deed of donation *inter vivos* covering ten parcels of land in favor of Consuelo G. Azurin. The donor’s brother, plaintiff Cipriano Yturralde, and his nephew signed as instrumental witnesses. The donation was conditioned on the Azurins providing support to Carmen and Cipriano and maintaining the family mausoleum. Carmen, who had suffered a stroke (hemiplegia) earlier that year, died in 1960. Subsequently, Cipriano filed an action to annul the donation, alleging fraudulent misrepresentation. He claimed the Azurins told them the document was merely for the "administration" of properties, not a donation, and that Carmen lacked the capacity to consent as she could not speak or stand. The Court of First Instance of Antique dismissed the complaint and declared the donation valid.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the deed of donation is valid despite allegations of fraud and the donor's alleged lack of capacity.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the deed of donation was properly executed. The Court ruled that a notarial document is evidence of the facts expressed therein in a clear, unequivocal manner and enjoys the presumption of regularity. To contradict the facts contained in a notarial document, the evidence must be "clear, convincing and more than merely preponderant" [1], citing *Mendezona v. Philippine Sugar Estates Development Co.* and *El Hogar Filipino v. Olviga*.

The Court found that the plaintiff failed to overcome this presumption. Evidence from the notary public and the drafting lawyer established that Carmen, though hemiplegic, was of sound mind, could speak, and understood the transaction [2, 3]. The plaintiff's claim of fraud was negated by his own participation as an instrumental witness and his acceptance of benefits (support and housing) from the donees for years in accordance with the deed's conditions [4, 5]. Furthermore, the donation complied with Article 749 of the Civil Code, being in a public instrument with acceptance made in the same deed [6]. The decision appealed from was affirmed.
