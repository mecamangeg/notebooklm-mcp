I. CAPTION
TERESITA C. YAPTINCHAY v. HON. GUILLERMO E. TORRES, et al., G.R. No. L-26462, June 9, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Isidro Y. Yaptinchay died intestate on July 7, 1965, leaving behind a legitimate wife, Josefina, and children, as well as an estate valued at approximately P500,000 [1]. Petitioner Teresita C. Yaptinchay, alleging she lived with the deceased as husband and wife for 19 years, filed a petition for Special Letters of Administration in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, Pasay City Branch [1]. The legitimate family opposed this, and the probate court eventually appointed respondent Virginia Y. Yaptinchay (Isidro's daughter) as Special Administratrix [2, 3].

Virginia included a house in North Forbes Park, Makati, in the estate inventory [3]. Teresita subsequently filed a separate civil action (Civil Case No. 8873) in the CFI of Rizal, Pasig Branch (presided by Judge Torres), for replevin and liquidation of her alleged partnership with the deceased, seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the administratrix from interfering with her possession of the North Forbes Park house [4]. The private respondents opposed, arguing the probate court had exclusive jurisdiction and that Teresita had no clear right to the property [5]. Judge Torres issued an order denying Teresita’s injunction and directing her to deliver possession of the house to Virginia, the Special Administratrix [6, 7]. Teresita filed this petition for certiorari, alleging grave abuse of discretion [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is entitled to a writ of preliminary injunction to retain possession of the North Forbes Park property.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, affirming that the grant or denial of an injunction rests upon the sound discretion of the court and will not be interfered with absent a clear abuse [10].

For a writ of injunction to issue, the petitioner must show a "clear positive right" or a "present right" calling for judicial protection [11]. Injunction is not a remedy to protect contingent, future, or abstract rights, nor to take property from one party and give it to another whose title has not been clearly established [9, 11].

The Court held that the property was acquired during the marriage of the deceased to Josefina Yaptinchay and is *prima facie* presumed to be part of the estate under the control of the special administratrix [12]. While Article 144 of the Civil Code governs property rights of common-law spouses under a co-ownership regime, this applies only if there is a clear showing that the petitioner contributed to the acquisition of the property [11, 12]. Teresita failed to prove such contribution; her evidence of loans did not establish that the funds were used for the construction of the house in question [13]. Consequently, she lacked the "present right" necessary for an injunction [11]. The property is better safeguarded in the hands of the bonded special administratrix under the control of the probate court [14].

The petition for certiorari is dismissed, and the mandatory injunction previously issued by the Supreme Court is dissolved [14].
