I. CAPTION
CARMEN YTURRALDE and CONSUELO G. AZURIN, accompanied by her husband, DR. RAYMUNDO AZURIN v. MARIANO VAGILIDAD and LUZ MANAGUIT, G.R. No. L-20571, May 30, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On December 10, 1955, Carmen Yturralde donated several parcels of land in Antique to plaintiff Consuelo G. Azurin. When Consuelo attempted to register the donation, she discovered the titles were in the possession of defendants Mariano Vagilidad and Luz Managuit, who refused to return them claiming Carmen owed them money. On July 2, 1956, Consuelo filed a petition to compel the surrender of the titles, which the court granted. During these proceedings, plaintiffs discovered a mortgage on the properties allegedly executed by Carmen in favor of the defendants on February 14, 1956 (after the donation), which was annotated on the titles.

Carmen and the Azurins filed a suit to annul the mortgage, alleging it was fraudulent and that the loans were actually incurred by Carmen's brother, Cipriano Yturralde. During the trial, Carmen died. Defendants moved to have Cipriano substitute her. The trial court denied the substitution because Cipriano had filed a separate suit against the Azurins to annul the donation, creating a conflict of interest. The trial court ruled in favor of plaintiffs, declaring the mortgage void based on evidence that Luz Managuit fraudulently obtained Carmen’s thumbprint while Carmen was asleep. Defendants appealed, questioning the non-substitution of parties and the finding of fraud.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the donees (Azurins) are the real parties in interest to prosecute the action for annulment of the mortgage despite the death of the donor (Carmen) and the non-substitution of her legal heir.
2. W/N the defendants can assail the validity of the prior donation to the Azurins.
3. W/N the mortgage executed by Carmen Yturralde is void for fraud.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Azurins are the real parties in interest. The Supreme Court held that the deceased Carmen Yturralde had no material interest in the suit as she had already parted with the ownership of the properties via donation. The Azurins, as successors-in-interest, are the ones prejudiced by the recorded mortgage which follows the property. A person who is not a party obliged in a contract may exercise an action for nullity if they are prejudiced in their rights (Teves vs. PHHC, 23 SCRA 1141). Furthermore, the non-substitution of Cipriano was, at best, harmless error under Section 5, Rule 51 of the Rules of Court, as his interest was inimical to the plaintiffs.

2. **NO.** The defendants cannot assail the validity of the donation. Whether valid or void, the donation does not affect their rights as mortgagees, which attach to the property regardless of the owner. Additionally, they cannot claim the donation was in fraud of creditors (Article 1381, Civil Code) because they were secured by the registered mortgage. The donation, being a public document, enjoys the presumption of validity (Section 24, Rule 132, Revised Rules of Court).

3. **YES.** The mortgage is void. The Court affirmed the factual findings of the trial court that the mortgage was fraudulently obtained. Evidence showed that defendant Luz Managuit entered Carmen's room while she was asleep and pressed her thumb against the papers. The Court found this evidence clear and convincing, sufficient to overcome the presumption *fraus est odiosa et non praesumenda* (fraud is odious and not presumed). The records also established that the loans were incurred by Cipriano, not Carmen.

The judgment of the lower court is AFFIRMED.
