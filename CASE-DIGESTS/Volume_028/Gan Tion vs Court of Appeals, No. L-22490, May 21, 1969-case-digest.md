I. CAPTION
GAN TION v. COURT OF APPEALS, JUDGE AGUSTIN P. MONTESA, ONG WAN SIENG and THE SHERIFF OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-22490, May 21, 1969, 28 SCRA 235, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Ong Wan Sieng (respondent) was a tenant of Gan Tion (petitioner). Gan Tion filed an ejectment case against Ong Wan Sieng for non-payment of rentals. The Court of First Instance eventually dismissed the complaint and ordered Gan Tion to pay Ong Wan Sieng P500.00 as attorney's fees, a judgment which became final. Subsequently, Gan Tion served notice increasing the rent and demanded P4,320.00 in rental arrears from Ong Wan Sieng.

Ong Wan Sieng obtained a writ of execution for the P500.00 attorney's fees. Gan Tion opposed this by pleading legal compensation, arguing that Ong Wan Sieng owed him P4,320.00. The Court of Appeals ruled against Gan Tion, holding that the P500.00 could not be the subject of legal compensation because it was a "trust fund" for the lawyer, and thus the requirement that parties be creditors and debtors of each other in their own right (Arts. 1278 and 1279, Civil Code) was not met.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the award for attorney's fees may be the subject of legal compensation against a judgment debt for unpaid rentals.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals. The Court ruled that an award for attorney's fees is made in favor of the litigant, not his counsel, and is justified by way of indemnity for damages recoverable under Article 2208 of the Civil Code. It is the litigant, not the counsel, who is the judgment creditor and who may enforce the judgment by execution. Therefore, the credit may properly be the subject of legal compensation. The Court noted it would be unjust to compel the petitioner to pay P500.00 when his creditor is admittedly indebted to him for more than P4,000.00. The judgment of the Court of Appeals was reversed and the writ of execution set aside.
