I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION AS A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, JAMES UY, also known as UY KHE KHUN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20194, July 17, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner James Uy, a citizen of Nationalist China born in Manila, filed a petition for naturalization on May 29, 1961 [1]. He claimed to have a monthly salary of P180.00 as an employee of Uy Su Bin and Co., Inc., plus annual dividends of P1,660.00 from inherited stocks [1]. However, the record showed he was employed by the firm—which was owned and controlled by his family (his uncle being the president)—only one month prior to filing his petition [2, 3]. Additionally, the petitioner's name appeared as "Uy James alias Uy Khe Khun" in the firm's Stock and Transfer Book and on a stock certificate, without lawful authority for the alias [4]. The Court of First Instance denied the petition for lack of a lucrative trade and failure to prove irreproachable conduct [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation.
2. W/N the petitioner's use of an alias constitutes improper conduct.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court found the petitioner's employment to be fictitious, describing it as a "mere convenient arrangement" planned to show token compliance with the law, given that he was hired only one month before filing in a family-controlled firm [3]. Moreover, even accepting his claims regarding salary and dividends, the total is insufficient. Citing *Keng Giok* (G.R. No. L-13347), the Court held that even an annual income of P8,687.50 does not satisfy the requirement for a lucrative trade or occupation [4].

2. **YES.** The use of the alias "Uy Khe Khun" in official documents like the stock certificate and transfer book without lawful authority is sufficient basis to establish improper conduct [4]. The Court rejected the petitioner's excuse that his mother caused the entry, noting that the documents proved he was known by that alias within his own family [4].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED [6].
