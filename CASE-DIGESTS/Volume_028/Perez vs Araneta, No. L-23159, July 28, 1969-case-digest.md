I. CAPTION
TRUSTEESHIP OF BENIGNO, ANTONIO and ANGELA, all surnamed PEREZ Y TUASON; ANTONIO M. PEREZ v. J. ANTONIO ARANETA, G.R. Nos. L-23159, L-23160, L-23161, & L-24297, July 28, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
J. Antonio Araneta served as the trustee for a trust created by the late Angela S. Tuason for the benefit of Benigno, Angela, and Antonio Perez y Tuason [1]. Antonio M. Perez, the judicial guardian of the beneficiaries, appealed orders from the trial court (Special Proceeding No. Q-73) regarding the trust's administration solely in his capacity as guardian while the beneficiaries were minors [2].

Under the trust's terms, termination would occur when all beneficiaries reached legal age and a majority agreed to terminate it [3]. By April 17, 1969, all three beneficiaries had attained legal age [2]. Subsequently, the beneficiaries and the trustee agreed to terminate the trust effective April 30, 1969, and filed a "Joint Manifestation and Motion for Approval of Project of Partition," which the lower court granted [4]. The beneficiaries ratified the trustee's accounts and fees and filed a Joint Motion to Dismiss in the Supreme Court, stating they had no further desire to prosecute the appeals and that all pending incidents should be considered abandoned and withdrawn [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeals should be dismissed for being moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the cases had become moot and academic [7]. The beneficiaries, who are the real parties in interest and have all reached the age of majority, along with the trustee, mutually agreed to terminate the trust and distribute the estate [3, 6]. Furthermore, they expressly manifested that the appeals were abandoned and withdrawn, rendering the resolution of issues—such as whether expenses should be charged to principal or income—unnecessary as the beneficiaries are now entitled to both [5, 8]. Consequently, the Supreme Court resolved to dismiss all the cases [9].

**Cases dismissed.**
