I. CAPTION
BINGING HO v. THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF BONGAO, SULU, and BONSAN GO, G.R. No. L-29051, July 28, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In the November 1967 elections, Binging Ho and Bonsan Go were candidates for mayor of Bongao, Sulu [1]. During the canvass, the Municipal Board of Canvassers discovered a discrepancy between the words and figures in the election return for Precinct No. 13 involving 20 votes, which would materially affect the election result [1, 2]. The Board suspended the canvass for that precinct. Ho filed a petition for judicial recount in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Sulu [2]. Meanwhile, a portion of the Board proclaimed Go as mayor, but the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) later annulled this proclamation [2]. The CFI denied Go's motion to dismiss and ordered the recount [2, 3]. Go appealed, challenging the constitutionality of Sections 163 and 168 of the Revised Election Code. He argued that a recount is an administrative function under the exclusive jurisdiction of the COMELEC and that conferring this power on the CFI violates the principle of separation of powers [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Sections 163 and 168 of the Revised Election Code are unconstitutional for vesting the power of judicial recount in the Courts of First Instance.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the orders of the lower court [5]. The Court held that while the actual physical recount of ballots does not itself involve a decision in a judicial controversy, it is the "necessary consequence" of the court's resolution of a preliminary judicial controversy: ascertaining whether a discrepancy exists between authentic copies of returns to warrant opening the ballot boxes [6]. This determination of facts is essentially a judicial function [6].

Furthermore, the Court ruled that the COMELEC's authority under Section 2, Article X of the Constitution is limited to "questions purely administrative in nature" [7]. Since the jurisdiction to order a recount is not explicitly vested by the Constitution in any specific body, it is within the legislative prerogative to confer this authority upon the Courts of First Instance for the sake of expediency and to provide a prompt remedy [7, 8]. The orders appealed from were affirmed, and the Board was directed to convene, canvass the returns (including the judicial recount result), and proclaim the winner [5, 9].
