I. CAPTION
LOURDES DE LA RAMA v. AUGUSTO R. VILLAROSA and LUZON SURETY COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-17927, June 29, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff De la Rama sued defendant Villarosa and his surety, Luzon Surety Company, Inc., for breach of a lease contract. The trial court ruled in favor of De la Rama. Pursuant to a writ of execution, the Sheriff garnished P71,533.99 from Luzon Surety’s bank deposit with Philippine Trust Co. However, the bank did not deliver the funds to the Sheriff because Luzon Surety obtained a preliminary injunction from the Court of Appeals pending its appeal. The Court of Appeals ultimately modified the decision, reducing Luzon Surety's liability to approximately P33,000. Luzon Surety then filed a motion in the trial court seeking the restitution of the excess garnished amount and demanding that De la Rama pay 6% interest on the difference between the total amount garnished (P71,533.99) and the final judgment amount. The trial court denied the motion for interest.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendant surety is entitled to interest on the portion of the garnished funds that exceeded the final judgment amount.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's order denying the interest. The Court provided four reasons:
1.  **No Possession:** The Sheriff never actually took possession of the funds. The execution was suspended by the preliminary injunction issued by the appellate court [1].
2.  **Nature of Garnishment:** Mere garnishment does not effect the delivery of money to the sheriff or the plaintiff. The funds remained in the custody of the garnishee bank [2].
3.  **Procedural Bar:** The motion for damages or interest was filed after the judgment had already become final. Under Rule 59, Sec. 20 (Rules of Court), damages incident to the issuance of an attachment may only be claimed *before* final judgment [3].
4.  **No Actual Damages:** There was no allegation or proof that the garnishment caused actual damages, such as the inability to pay an interest-bearing obligation [4].

Petition denied; judgment affirmed.
