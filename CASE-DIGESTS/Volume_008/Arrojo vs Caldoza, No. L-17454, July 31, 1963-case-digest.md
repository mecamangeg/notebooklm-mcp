I. CAPTION
CORNELIO ARROJO v. WENCESLAO CALDOZA, et al., G.R. No. L-17454, July 31, 1963, Dizon, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Cornelio Arrojo filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Leyte to recover a parcel of land in Dagami, Leyte, from Wenceslao Caldoza and his co-defendants [2]. In their Answer, the defendants stated they lacked knowledge sufficient to form a belief regarding the truth of the plaintiff's allegations [3]. They explicitly averred that they had not occupied any property belonging to the plaintiff, asserting instead that they possessed and owned the land inherited from their own predecessors-in-interest [3]. Arrojo moved for a judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the Answer failed to tender an issue [4]. The trial court granted the motion, declaring Arrojo the true owner and ordering the defendants to pay attorney's fees [2]. The defendants appealed the decision to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court properly rendered judgment on the pleadings [5].

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that judgment on the pleadings was improper because the defendants' Answer was sufficient to raise the issue of ownership and possession over the land [5, 6]. The Court reasoned that the defendants' allegations clearly denied the plaintiff's claim of ownership and positively asserted their own claim [5]. Since the pleadings tendered a genuine issue, a decision based solely on the pleadings was not warranted [5].

The decision appealed from is SET ASIDE and the record of the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [5].
