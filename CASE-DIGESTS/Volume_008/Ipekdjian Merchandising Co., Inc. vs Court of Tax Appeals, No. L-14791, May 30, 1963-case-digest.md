I. CAPTION
IPEKDJIAN MERCHANDISING CO., INC. v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS and COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-14791, May 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On January 11, 1951, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed Ipekdjian Merchandising Co., Inc. (Petitioner) P97,502.25 in compensating tax and surcharges for gold chains converted into bullion, plus a P200.00 penalty [1]. Petitioner appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals (BTA), docketed as BTA Case No. 10, which affirmed the CIR’s decision [2]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, but the appeal was dismissed without prejudice on March 30, 1954, based on the ruling in *U.S.T. v. Board of Tax Appeals* declaring the BTA an administrative body; this dismissal became final on May 14, 1954 [2, 3].

Subsequently, Republic Act No. 1125 was enacted on June 16, 1954, creating the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) and abolishing the BTA [4, 5]. Petitioner attempted to reinstate its appeal or file a new case with the CTA (Case No. 107), but it was dismissed for being filed beyond the 30-day period [2]. On November 3, 1956, Petitioner made a partial payment of P5,000.00 [6]. On February 26, 1958, the CIR filed a motion for execution of the judgment in BTA Case No. 10 with the CTA for the balance. The CTA granted the motion [6]. Petitioner challenged the CTA’s jurisdiction, arguing the case was no longer "pending" as required by RA 1125 [5, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Tax Appeals has the jurisdiction to issue a writ of execution for a final and executory decision rendered by the defunct Board of Tax Appeals.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the CTA has jurisdiction to execute the BTA decision. Under Section 21 of R.A. No. 1125, all cases "pending" in the BTA were transferred to the CTA [5]. The Court interpreted "pending" to include not only cases filed but not yet heard or decided, but also those "filed, heard and decided, but the judgment of which has not yet been executed and fully satisfied" [8-10].

The Court emphasized that execution is "the fruit and end of the suit" and "the life of the law," and that proceedings on execution are part of the suit [11, 12]. Although the BTA was originally administrative in character per *U.S.T. v. BTA*, R.A. No. 1125 conferred judicial character on its proceedings and decisions [4, 13]. Since the CTA took over the functions of the BTA, denying it the power to execute would render judicial power incomplete [14, 15]. Furthermore, the Petitioner, having made a partial payment on the final judgment, was precluded from resorting to technicalities to evade the balance [11, 15, 16].

The Petition for Certiorari is dismissed [17, 18].
