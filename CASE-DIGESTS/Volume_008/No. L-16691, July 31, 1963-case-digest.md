I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. RAMCAR, INC., G.R. No. L-16691, July 31, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Ramcar, Inc., a domestic corporation assembling "Hillman Minx" automobiles, entered into a contract designating Henderson Trippe (Phil.) Inc. as its exclusive distributor [1]. Pursuant to this agreement, Ramcar sold 20 locally assembled cars to Henderson Trippe at a wholesale price of P4,950.00 per unit, paying the 30% sales tax on this amount under Section 184(a) of the National Internal Revenue Code [2, 3]. Henderson Trippe subsequently sold the cars to third parties at prices ranging from P5,000.00 to P6,300.00 [3]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed a deficiency sales tax, arguing that Henderson Trippe acted merely as Ramcar's agent, and therefore tax should be based on the higher gross sales price paid by the ultimate buyers [3]. The CIR cited instances of direct delivery and payment to Ramcar by ultimate buyers as evidence of agency [4, 5]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled in favor of Ramcar, cancelling the assessment after finding the contract was one of sale, not agency [4]. The CIR appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the contract between Ramcar and Henderson Trippe is one of agency, subjecting Ramcar to higher sales taxes based on sales to ultimate buyers.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's decision, holding that the agreement was a contract of sale, not agency [5, 6]. The Court found that the variations in the contract's implementation cited by the CIR were satisfactorily explained and did not alter the nature of the agreement [5, 7]. Specifically, the failure to deliver the stipulated number of cars was due to Central Bank controls; the direct deliveries and lack of a showroom were temporary arrangements while the distributor established facilities; and direct payments to Ramcar occurred in only 4 out of 20 transactions due to personal relationships with the management [5]. Furthermore, the appointment of other distributors was a valid exercise of Ramcar's right to withdraw territory under the contract [8]. A contract of sale does not become one of agency merely because of variations in implementation that are satisfactorily explained [9]. Consequently, the percentage sales tax was correctly based on the wholesale price paid by the distributor, not the ultimate purchasers [10].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [6].
