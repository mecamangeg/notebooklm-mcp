I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. KUSAIN SAIK, QUIAMA AKAN, and LUZON SURETY COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-17060, May 30, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Guiama Akan and Kusain Saik were convicted of murder with physical injuries. They appealed to the Supreme Court, and Luzon Surety Company, Inc. posted a P14,000.00 bail bond for Akan's provisional release [1, 2]. After the Court dismissed Akan's appeal, the trial court scheduled the reading of the sentence [2]. The surety failed to produce Akan despite extensions, eventually filing a motion claiming Akan had died in a skirmish with Philippine Constabulary soldiers in Lanao [2]. The trial court initially ordered the forfeiture of the full P14,000.00 bond but later issued an order reducing the surety's liability to P500.00 [2, 3]. The reduction was based on a letter from a mayor, a letter from a bandit leader, and a joint affidavit stating Akan died on November 15, 1956 [3, 4]. The Assistant Provincial Fiscal appealed this order reducing the liability [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court properly reduced the bail bond liability based on the affidavits and letters presented regarding the accused's death.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the reduction of the bail bond was improper because it relied on incompetent evidence. The Court ruled that the death of the bailed accused "cannot be deemed established by such hearsay evidence" consisting merely of letters and affidavits [4]. The trial court should have examined the affiants and authors of the letters under oath to determine the fact of death by "admissible and competent evidence" [4, 5]. Consequently, the order appealed from was **SET ASIDE**, and the case was remanded to the lower court to properly determine the fact of the accused's death [4].
