I. CAPTION
ALFONSO CABABA v. BALBINO REMIGIO and PONCIANO CARILLO, G.R. Nos. L-17832-33, May 29, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Remigio and Carillo applied for certificates of public convenience to operate ferry services across the Cagayan River. Petitioner Cababa, an existing ferry operator on the same route, opposed the applications, arguing that: (1) respondents were financially incapable; (2) there was no public necessity for additional services; and (3) he should be given preference as the prior operator. Cababa specifically argued that Remigio was financially unsound because he had previously sold a TPU certificate, and Carillo was unsound because he had allowed a truck to be foreclosed. The Public Service Commission (PSC) granted the respondents' applications. The PSC reasoned that Cababa, who also operated TPU trucks, enjoyed an advantage that allowed him to discriminate against passengers of rival TPU operators (like the respondents) regarding ferry accommodations. Cababa appealed the decision.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondents are financially capable of operating the ferry services.
2. W/N the grant of additional certificates to respondents was proper despite the opposition of the prior operator.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the mere fact that an applicant previously sold a TPU certificate or allowed the foreclosure of a defective and expensive-to-maintain truck does not imply unsound financial condition [1]. The record showed both respondents owned substantial assets, including agricultural land, houses, and other public utility vehicles, which sufficiently established their financial capacity [2, 3].

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the PSC's decision, holding that the test for granting additional services is whether it serves the "best interest of the public" [4]. The Court agreed that Cababa’s position as both a ferry and bus operator created a risk of discrimination against passengers of competing bus operators during river crossings. A common carrier should not give unnecessary preference to its own traffic to the prejudice of others. Thus, the additional services were necessary to break this monopoly and serve the public convenience [5].

Decision affirmed.
