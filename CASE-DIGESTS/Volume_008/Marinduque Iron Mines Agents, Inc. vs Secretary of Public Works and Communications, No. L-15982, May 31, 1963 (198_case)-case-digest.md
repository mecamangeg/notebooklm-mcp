I. CAPTION
MARINDUQUE IRON MINES AGENTS, INC. v. THE SECRETARY OF PUBLIC WORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS, G.R. No. L-15982, May 31, 1963, Makalintal, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Marinduque Iron Mines Agents, Inc. was denounced for constructing a causeway near the mouth of the Calat-an Creek in Sipalay, Negros Occidental [3]. Following an investigation, the respondent Secretary of Public Works and Communications issued a decision on January 16, 1959, ordering the petitioner to remove the structure and restore the riverbed within 30 days, pursuant to Republic Act No. 2056 [3, 4]. Instead of appealing this decision to the President, the petitioner filed a petition for certiorari in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to annul the respondent's order [3]. The CFI dismissed the petition for lack of cause of action, ruling that the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not appealing the Secretary's decision to the President [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner was required to exhaust administrative remedies by appealing to the President before seeking judicial relief.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner was not required to appeal to the President. While the President has the constitutional power of control over executive departments, Republic Act No. 2056 does not expressly provide for such an appeal [5]. The Act prescribes peremptory periods—specifically 30 days for removal of obstructions and 90 days for the termination of investigations—and imposes criminal liability for non-compliance [6]. The Court reasoned that an appeal to the President would not be "sufficiently effective, adequate and expeditious" given these inexorable statutory timelines [5, 7]. Furthermore, the Court applied the doctrine of qualified political agency (alter-ego doctrine) reiterated in *Dimaisip v. Court of Appeals*, which posits that the action of a Department Secretary bears the implied sanction of the President unless disapproved by the latter [7, 8]. Thus, prior exhaustion of administrative remedies was unnecessary.

The order appealed from is reversed, and the case is remanded to the court *a quo* for trial and judgment on the merits [8].
