I. CAPTION
MARIANO ZAMORA v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE and COURT OF TAX APPEALS (consolidated with related cases), G.R. Nos. L-15290, L-15280, L-15289 & L-15281, May 31, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Mariano Zamora, owner of the Bay View Hotel and Farmacia Zamora, filed income tax returns for 1951 and 1952. The Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) determined deficiency income taxes, disallowing certain deductions and finding undeclared capital gains. Specifically, Zamora claimed Php 20,957.00 as promotion expenses for his wife's trip abroad to purchase machinery and observe hotel management, but the CIR disallowed 50% of this as personal expenses since the trip was also for medical purposes and lacked receipts. Zamora also claimed a 3.5% depreciation rate for the Bay View Hotel, which the CIR reduced to 2.5%. Furthermore, Zamora and his sister sold real properties in Manila and Quezon City in 1951 which were acquired during the Japanese Occupation (1944). The CIR assessed capital gains based on the selling price. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) modified the assessment: it sustained the 50% disallowance of promotion expenses, upheld the 2.5% depreciation rate, and applied the Ballantyne Scale to value the cost basis of the properties acquired with Japanese war notes. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CTA erred in disallowing 50% of the alleged promotion expenses incurred by the petitioner's wife.
2. W/N the depreciation rate of 2.5% applied to the Bay View Hotel building is reasonable and correct.
3. W/N the Ballantyne Scale should be applied to determine the cost basis of property acquired using Japanese war notes for capital gains tax purposes.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court affirmed the 50% disallowance. Under Section 30 of the Tax Code, business expenses must be "ordinary and necessary" and substantiated by records. Since Mrs. Zamora’s application for dollar allocation stated the trip was for "medical and business" purposes and no receipts were presented to distinguish the expenses, the allocation of 50% for business and 50% for personal use was fair. When exact amounts cannot be determined due to lack of supporting papers, the court may determine the deductible amount from "all available data" (citing *Visayan Cebu Terminal Co., Inc. v. Collector of Int. Rev.*).

2. **YES.** The 2.5% depreciation rate is correct. The CTA relied on "Bulletin F" of the U.S. Federal Internal Revenue Service, which estimates the useful life of concrete hotels at 40 years (equivalent to 2.5%). While Bulletin F is not binding, it has strong persuasive effect as the Philippine Income Tax Law is patterned after the U.S. law. The Court rejected petitioner's reliance on a hotel management book, noting that courts may look into the legislative history and antecedents of statutes (citing *Director of Lands v. Abaya*).

3. **YES.** The cost basis of property acquired in Japanese war notes is the equivalent of the notes in genuine Philippine currency in accordance with the Ballantyne Scale of values. The gain or loss is not affected by the decline in purchasing power of the currency at the time of sale. For the Manila property bought in May 1944 partly in war notes, the Court converted the war note portion at a ratio of 12:1 (May 1944 scale) to determine the true acquisition cost in Philippine Pesos, thereby correctly computing the capital gains.

The petition is **DISMISSED**, and the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
