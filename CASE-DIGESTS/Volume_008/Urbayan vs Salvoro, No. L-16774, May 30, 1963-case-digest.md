I. CAPTION
EUGENIO URBAYAN and PATROCENIA MERCADO URBAYAN v. EVARISTO SALVORO, G.R. No. L-16774, May 30, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On January 12, 1954, plaintiffs-appellees (Urbayans) filed an action in the Municipal Court of Tacloban, Leyte against defendant-appellant (Salvoro) for the rescission of a lease contract regarding two apartments. They sought recovery of P2,225.00 in compensatory and moral damages, P31.00 daily earnings lost, and P500.00 in attorney's fees. Salvoro moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, but the motion was denied. The Municipal Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, rescinding the contract and awarding damages.

Salvoro appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte. In his answer, he reiterated the affirmative defense that the Municipal Court lacked original jurisdiction to hear the case. The CFI, however, rendered judgment affirming the rescission and ordering Salvoro to pay P3,000.00 in damages and P500.00 in attorney's fees. Salvoro appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved a question of jurisdiction.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipal Court had jurisdiction over an action for rescission of contract and recovery of damages exceeding P2,000.00.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that an action for the rescission of a lease contract and recovery of damages exceeding two thousand pesos is clearly beyond the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court under Section 88 of Republic Act No. 296. Consequently, the judgment rendered by the Municipal Court was a nullity.

Furthermore, the Court ruled that the defendant did not waive his objection to the jurisdiction. By raising the lack of jurisdiction in his answer filed with the Court of First Instance, he did not consent to the CFI's exercise of original jurisdiction. The only power the CFI had was to dismiss the action. Therefore, the judgment rendered by the CFI, in spite of the objection to the original jurisdiction assumed by the lower court, was also a patent nullity.

The judgment appealed from is set aside and the complaint dismissed.
