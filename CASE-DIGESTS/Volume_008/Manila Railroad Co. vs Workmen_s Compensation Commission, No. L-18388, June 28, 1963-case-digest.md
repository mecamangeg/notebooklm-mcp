**I. CAPTION**
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMlSSlON, et al., G.R. No. L-18388, June 28, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Domingo Punzal was employed by petitioner Manila Railroad Company (MRR) intermittently from 1929 until his death in 1957, serving primarily as a brakeman and assistant train conductor [1, 2]. His duties involved strenuous physical labor, night travel, and exposure to all weather conditions [1, 2]. On April 1, 1957, Punzal applied for optional retirement due to tuberculosis [1, 2]. He was granted leave but died on October 3, 1957 [1, 2].

Punzal’s heirs filed a claim for death benefits only on September 28, 1959, approximately 20 months after his death [3]. The Hearing Officer dismissed the complaint, finding the cause of death independent of employment [4]. However, the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed this decision, ruling that the illness was aggravated by the nature of Punzal's work and ordering MRR to pay benefits [4]. MRR petitioned for review, arguing, among other things, that the claim was barred for being filed late [2, 5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the heirs' claim for compensation is barred for failure to file within the statutory period.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the WCC decision. The Court held that under Section 24 of Act 3428 (Workmen's Compensation Act), a claim for compensation in case of death must be made "not later than 3 months after death" [3, 6].

The Court established that this provision is a **condition precedent** for the maintenance of any compensation proceeding under the Act [3]. Non-compliance with this requirement bars the recovery of compensation [3, 7]. Since the heirs filed the complaint 20 months after Punzal's death—well beyond the 3-month period—the claim cannot prosper [3, 7]. Citing *Luzon Stevedoring Company v. Hon. Cesareo de Leon*, the Court reiterated that previous notice of injury and filing within the fixed period are mandatory [3].

The decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission is **REVERSED** [7].
