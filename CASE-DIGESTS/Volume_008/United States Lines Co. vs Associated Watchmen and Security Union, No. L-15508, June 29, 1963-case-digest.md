I. CAPTION
UNITED STATES LINES COMPANY and JULIO ROXAS v. ASSOCIATED WATCHMEN AND SECURITY UNION (PTWO), et al., G.R. No. L-15508, June 29, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Associated Watchmen and Security Union (PTWO) and eleven of its members filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) against petitioners United States Lines Company (USL) and its Port Captain, Julio Roxas [1]. The complainants alleged they were USL employees dismissed due to union activities [1]. USL argued the watchmen were employees of "Maligaya Ship Watchmen Agency," operated by Tomas Caraveo, claiming the agency was an independent contractor [2]. Caraveo, who also served as USL's head watchman and supervisor, had recruited the respondents [3].

On February 18, 1956, the respondents went on strike [3]. Subsequently, on April 2, 1956, Caraveo’s agency signed a closed-shop agreement with the Maligaya Ship Watchmen Union [4]. When the striking watchmen sought reinstatement, Caraveo refused unless they joined the Maligaya Union, citing the closed-shop provision [5, 6]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled in favor of the union, ordering reinstatement with back wages [1]. USL petitioned for review.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the watchmen were employees of USL and not the agency.
2. W/N the closed-shop agreement justified the refusal to reinstate the watchmen.
3. W/N the petitioners committed Unfair Labor Practice.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that while the watchmen agency may be an independent contractor regarding the *recruitment* of watchmen, it is not an independent contractor regarding the *guarding* of ships and cargo [7]. When recruited watchmen actually render guard service to the shipping company, under the supervision of its officers, and receive pay from it, they become employees of the shipping company [7, 8].

2. **NO.** The closed-shop agreement was entered into on April 2, 1956, while the watchmen had already gone on strike on February 18, 1956 [9]. A closed-shop provision cannot operate retroactively to compel those already employed to join the favored union [9, 10]. The strike did not deprive them of their status as employees [9, 11].

3. **YES.** The CIR found substantial evidence that watchmen were dismissed for inducing others to join their union or for being seen in the picket line [12, 13]. The refusal to reinstate based on the retroactive application of a closed-shop agreement further supported the finding of ULP [6, 14].

**Petition denied. Decision affirmed.**
