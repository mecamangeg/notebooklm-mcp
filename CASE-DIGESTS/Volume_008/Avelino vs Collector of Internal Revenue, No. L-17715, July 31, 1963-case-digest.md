I. CAPTION
JOSE AVELINO v. THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-17715, July 31, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Collector of Internal Revenue assessed petitioner Jose Avelino for deficiency income taxes for the years 1946, 1947, and 1948 using the net worth method. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) substantially confirmed the assessments. Avelino challenged the opening net worth used for 1946, claiming he had significant cash on hand (P47,300) derived from his wife’s alleged earnings of P55,000, presenting her 1946 income tax return (filed in 1949) as proof. He also argued that certain investments in Talisay Lumber Co. and a partnership were paid for by the organizers, not him, and thus should not be imputed as income. Additionally, he claimed the existence of loans from Rosario Gray de Hays and Angela M. Vda. de Butte to justify his assets and lower his net worth. The CTA rejected these claims and found evidence of fraud due to the large disparity between Avelino’s declared income and his actual calculated income. Avelino appealed to the Supreme Court, raising issues on the method used, the appreciation of evidence regarding assets and liabilities, and prescription.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CTA erred in rejecting the petitioner's claimed opening net worth based on his wife's income tax return.
2. W/N the CTA correctly treated the petitioner's investments and alleged loans.
3. W/N the assessment of deficiency income taxes has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The CTA did not err. The Court affirmed the rejection of the petitioner's claim regarding the opening net worth. The wife's income tax return was deemed a self-serving statement because it failed to provide details on how the alleged P55,000 gain was earned, used, invested, or deposited [1, 2]. Without explanation as to why such a large sum was not deposited in a bank or how it was utilized, the lower court correctly gave no credence to the existence of said cash on hand [2].

2. **YES.** The CTA correctly treated the investments and loans. Regarding the investments in Talisay Lumber Co., even if the shares were paid for by the company organizers as Avelino claimed, the total amount constitutes a gift or income received by the petitioner, which is liable to tax [3, 4]. Regarding the alleged loans, the Court found the evidence insufficient. The deed of sale associated with the Hays loan did not mention any unpaid balance [5], and the alleged Butte loan lacked interest payments. Evidence of such character is generally insufficient for purposes of income tax laws [6, 7].

3. **NO.** The assessments have not prescribed because the petitioner committed fraud. Avelino declared amounts representing only small fractions of his actual income (e.g., declaring P5,258.99 in 1946 versus an actual income of P105,223.06) [8]. Under Section 332 of the Internal Revenue Law, when the taxpayer is guilty of fraud, the period for liability begins from the moment the fraud is discovered, not when the return was filed [9, 10].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
