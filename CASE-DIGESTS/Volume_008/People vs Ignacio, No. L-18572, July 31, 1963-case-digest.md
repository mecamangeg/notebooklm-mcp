I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PEDRO IGNACIO, ET AL., accused; PHILIPPINE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CO., INC., bondsman-appellant, G.R. No. L-18572, July 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Pedro Ignacio was charged with murder before the Court of First Instance of Manila and was granted provisional liberty upon posting a bond of P20,000.00 through appellant Philippine International Security Co., Inc. [1]. When called for hearing on April 8, 1959, Ignacio failed to appear, prompting the trial court to confiscate the bond and order the appellant to show cause why judgment should not be rendered against it [2].

The appellant requested extensions and exerted efforts to locate the accused. Approximately nine months later, on January 19, 1960, the appellant finally apprehended Ignacio and surrendered him to the court [2, 3]. The appellant then moved for the cancellation of the bond and the lifting of the confiscation order. On February 2, 1960, the trial court denied the motion to lift confiscation entirely but exercised its discretion to reduce the appellant's liability by 50%, from P20,000.00 to P10,000.00 [2]. The bondsman appealed, seeking complete relief.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the bondsman is entitled to complete exoneration from liability due to the subsequent capture and surrender of the accused.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. A surety is considered the jailer of the accused and assumes absolute responsibility for their custody; it is the surety's inevitable obligation to keep the accused under surveillance at all times [4]. The Court cited *People v. Tuising* and *People v. Rizal Surety*, reiterating that the surety's authority is derived from the Government's authority to hold the accused under preventive imprisonment [4].

Since the appellant failed to produce the accused when required and was only able to surrender him almost nine months after his failure to appear, the appellant is not entitled to complete exoneration [3]. Following the policy in *People v. Puyal*, the efforts made to capture the accused merely entitle the surety to a mitigation of liability, not full relief [5]. The trial court correctly exercised its discretion in reducing the liability to 50% [5, 6].

Order affirmed, with costs against appellant [7].
