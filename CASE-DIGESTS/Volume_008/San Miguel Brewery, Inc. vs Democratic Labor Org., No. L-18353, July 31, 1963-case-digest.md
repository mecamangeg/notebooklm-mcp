I. CAPTION
SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC. v. DEMOCRATIC LABOR ORGANIZATION, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18353, July 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Democratic Labor Organization filed a complaint against Petitioner San Miguel Brewery, Inc. regarding demands for better employment conditions. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled in favor of the union, ordering Petitioner to pay: (1) overtime compensation to outside or field sales personnel under the Eight-Hour Labor Law; (2) night salary differentials to watchmen retroactive to dates prior to the demand; and (3) additional compensation to watchmen for work on Sundays and holidays.

Petitioner appealed, arguing that field sales personnel are exempt from the Eight-Hour Labor Law because they are paid on a commission basis. These employees leave the plant after roll call, have no daily time record, and manage their own routes which are designed to be completed within 8 hours. They receive a monthly salary plus sales commissions based on industry and effort. Petitioner also questioned the retroactivity of the night differentials and the entitlement of monthly-paid watchmen to Sunday premiums.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N outside or field sales personnel paid on a monthly salary plus commission are entitled to overtime pay under the Eight-Hour Labor Law.
2. W/N the award for night salary differentials may be made retroactive prior to the date of judicial demand.
3. W/N watchmen paid on a monthly basis are entitled to extra pay for work performed on Sundays and holidays.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Eight-Hour Labor Law has no application to employees paid on a piece-work, *pakiao*, or commission basis, regardless of the time employed [1]. Field sales personnel fall under this exception because their commission serves as extra compensation in lieu of overtime, and their earnings depend on their own industry and the volume of sales rather than hours worked [2, 3]. Since they are not subject to strict time supervision and have no daily time record, they are not entitled to overtime compensation [4, 5].

2. **YES.** While awards generally apply from the date of demand, an exception applies here because a similar claim had been filed long before and was the subject of negotiations and a strike [6, 7]. The strike was resolved with the specific understanding that the claim for night salary differentials would be settled in court, justifying the retroactive award [7].

3. **YES.** Section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 444 is mandatory and provides that no employer may compel an employee to work on Sundays and legal holidays unless paid an additional 25% of their regular compensation [8]. This right applies regardless of whether the employee is paid on a monthly basis, with the only exception being for public utilities performing public service [8].

**Petition is GRANTED in part. The award for overtime pay to field sales personnel is SET ASIDE. The awards for night salary differentials and Sunday/holiday pay are AFFIRMED.**
