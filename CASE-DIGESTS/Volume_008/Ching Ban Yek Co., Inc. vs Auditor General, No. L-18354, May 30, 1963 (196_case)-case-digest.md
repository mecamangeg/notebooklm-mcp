I. CAPTION
CHING BAN YEK CO., INC. v. AUDITOR GENERAL, G.R. No. L-18354, May 30, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the Supreme Court's decision dated December 29, 1962. The original decision upheld the Auditor General's ruling that hydrogenated cottonseed oil, when added to coconut oil to make vegetable lard, acts as a "component" rather than a "stabilizer" under Republic Act No. 601. This conclusion was based on the technical opinion of National Institute of Science and Technology Acting Deputy Commissioner Flaviano M. Yenko. In support of the Motion for Reconsideration, Petitioner submitted *new evidence* to dispute this technical finding, including a certificate from the Senate President, opinions from the National Science Development Board and an American Consultant, and a *new* opinion from Deputy Commissioner Yenko citing the scientific text "Industrial Oil and Fat Products" by Alton E. Bailey [1-5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the case should be remanded to the Auditor General to receive the new evidence submitted by the petitioner.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court reasoned that the documents submitted by the petitioner are in the nature of *new evidence*. Since the Respondent Auditor General was not given an opportunity to examine these documents or cross-examine the authors (including the officials who issued the new opinions) to test their credibility, the Court deemed it necessary to remand the proceedings. Consequently, without acting on the Motion for Reconsideration for the present, the case was **remanded to the respondent Auditor General for further action** [5, 6].
