I. CAPTION
SAN PABLO OIL FACTORY, INC. and WERNER P. SCHETELIG v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and KAPATIRANG MANGGAGAWA ASSOCIATION (NLU), G.R. No. L-18270, May 31, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Counsel for petitioners San Pablo Oil Factory, Inc. and Werner P. Schetelig received notice of the Supreme Court's resolution dated April 30, 1963, on May 10, 1963 [1]. Following the death of petitioner Schetelig, Attys. Ozaeta, Gibbs & Ozaeta entered their appearance on May 22, 1963, representing both the company and James McKeen, the special administrator of Schetelig’s estate [1].

The counsel filed two motions: (1) a motion to dismiss the case insofar as the deceased Schetelig and/or his estate was concerned; and (2) a motion for an extension of twenty (20) days to file a motion for reconsideration or take other appropriate legal remedies [2], [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the case should be dismissed regarding the deceased petitioner Schetelig.
2. W/N the motion for extension of time to file a motion for reconsideration should be granted.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court denied the motion for the dismissal of the case concerning the deceased petitioner Werner P. Schetelig, stating only that the motion was "for lack of merit" [3].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that where counsel files a motion to be permitted to file a motion for reconsideration or take other legal remedies, and the ground in support thereof is meritorious, the Court may in its discretion grant it [4], [5]. Finding the request meritorious, the Court granted the petitioners a period of twenty (20) days from notice to file a motion for reconsideration of the April 30, 1963 resolution or seek other proper legal remedies [3].

Accordingly, the motion for extension was GRANTED, while the motion for dismissal of the case was DENIED [6].
