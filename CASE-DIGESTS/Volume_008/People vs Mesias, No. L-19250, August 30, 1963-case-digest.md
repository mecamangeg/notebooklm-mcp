I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HIPOLITO MESIAS, G.R. No. L-19250, August 30, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of February 29, 1952, in Cabucgayan, Leyte, Pablo Masong and his family were awakened by three armed men asking for a light. Upon opening the door, the intruders, including accused Hipolito Mesias, entered. They tied up Pablo and stole cash and valuables worth over P150.00. Subsequently, the men took turns raping Pablo's stepdaughter, Leonila Taquillo [1]. The victims positively identified Mesias during the investigation [2]. Mesias raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was in Jaro, Leyte, buying a pig at the time of the crime [2]. The Court of First Instance convicted him of robbery in band with rape. The Court of Appeals found him guilty and, noting the aggravating circumstance of nighttime, imposed life imprisonment and certified the case to the Supreme Court [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over the positive identification of the accused.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The defense of alibi is untenable when supported only by oral evidence, which is easy to fabricate, and where the accused was positively identified by the victims [5, 6]. The Court found that the distance between the accused's alleged location and the crime scene—a nine to ten-hour boat ride—did not make it impossible for him to be present at the commission of the crime [6]. Furthermore, the rape victim categorically singled out Mesias as one of her abusers, and there was no evidence of any improper motive for the victims or police to testify falsely against him [5, 6].

Finding that the trial court failed to appreciate the aggravating circumstance of nighttime, the Supreme Court modified the penalty. Mesias was sentenced to *reclusión perpetua* and ordered to indemnify the rape victim, Leonila Taquillo, in the sum of P5,000.00; the judgment was affirmed in all other respects [7].
