I. CAPTION
NATIONAL WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY v. HON. GREGORIO D. MONTEJO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga City and CITY OF ZAMBOANGA, G.R. No. L-18043, May 31, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent City of Zamboanga filed a complaint against Petitioner NAWASA (Civil Case No. 607) for the recovery of the Zamboanga Waterworks and Sewerage System. The trial court (presided by Respondent Judge Montejo) ordered NAWASA to return the properties to the City and render an accounting. NAWASA filed a notice of appeal, appeal bond, and a record on appeal. However, Judge Montejo issued an order withholding the allowance of the record on appeal until NAWASA incorporated therein its "urgent motion for extension of time to file memorandum" and the "memorandum" itself. NAWASA moved for reconsideration, arguing that under Rule 41, Section 6 of the Rules of Court, these documents were not pleadings relating to the appealed order. The trial court denied the reconsideration, prompting NAWASA to file this petition to compel the allowance of the record on appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a memorandum and the motion for extension to file it must be included in the record on appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that a record on appeal must contain and present only facts, not arguments advanced by counsel. Under Section 6 of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, the record must include the order appealed from and copies of pleadings and orders "relating to the appealed order."

Citing *Aliño v. Villamor* (2 Phil. 234), the Court explained that the purpose of a record on appeal is to present the *facts* necessary for the appellate court to review the rulings; what is said by counsel by way of argument is "foreign and irrelevant." A memorandum is merely a formal or written summary of arguments on the issues involved in the litigation and cannot be considered as facts essential to the record on appeal. Therefore, the failure to incorporate it is not a lawful ground for disallowing the record. The Order appealed from is set aside, and the respondent court is directed to allow the record on appeal.
