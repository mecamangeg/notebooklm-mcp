I. CAPTION
PILAR T. DEL ROSARIO, MARIANO V. DEL ROSARIO and SALVADOR V. DEL ROSARIO v. HON. DAMIAN L. JIMENEZ, SANCHO R. JACINTO and DOMINGO BASCARA, G.R. No. L-17468, July 31, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Jacinto and Bascara filed a forcible entry case against petitioners (the Del Rosarios) in the Municipal Court of Quezon City, claiming ownership of land purchased from J.M. Tuazon & Co., Inc. Petitioners filed an answer claiming prior possession and ownership derived from a different source. They included a "third-party complaint" against the plaintiffs (respondents) and J.M. Tuazon & Co., Inc. for damages [1]. Petitioners also filed a separate suit for "reconveyance and/or recovery" in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal and moved to suspend the forcible entry proceedings in the Municipal Court pending the CFI case [2].

The Municipal Court denied the admission of the third-party complaint and the motion to suspend proceedings [2]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus in the CFI to review these orders, but the CFI dismissed the petition [1, 3]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the third-party complaint against the plaintiffs and J.M. Tuazon & Co. was proper.
2. W/N the forcible entry proceedings should be suspended pending the separate action for reconveyance.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the third-party complaint was improperly brought against the respondents (plaintiffs) because a mere counterclaim would suffice for claims against them [3, 4]. Regarding J.M. Tuazon & Co., Inc., the Court ruled that the claim for damages based on an alleged compromise agreement was extraneous to the issue of possession and would unnecessarily clutter the forcible entry case [3, 4]. The admission of a third-party complaint is discretionary, and the lower court did not abuse its discretion in denying it [3].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the issue of title involved in the separate action for reconveyance is not prejudicial to the determination of the issue of summary possession in the forcible entry case [5]. Furthermore, the reconveyance suit was filed after the forcible entry case was already pending and was deemed by the Court as obviously intended to delay the proceedings [5].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [6].
