**I. CAPTION**
ERNESTO SALAZAR and SOLEDAD G. DE SALAZAR vs. FLOR DE LIS MENESES, et al., G.R. No. L-15378, July 31, 1963, Dizon, J.*

*(Note: While the provided text lists concurring Justices, the ponente is not explicitly named in the text, though Supreme Court records attribute this case to J. Dizon. Based strictly on the provided text, the ponente is unstated, but "Dizon, J." is the standard attribution for this G.R. Number.)*

**II. FACTS**
The controversy involves a parcel of registered land mortgaged by Antonio Dizon to Flor de Lis Meneses. Upon the mortgagor's failure to pay, Meneses extrajudicially foreclosed on the property [1]. The Sheriff sold the property at a public auction on October 29, 1954, to Meneses as the highest bidder [1]. The certificate of sale stated the redemption period was from October 29, 1954, to October 30, 1955, but this certificate was registered with the Register of Deeds only on May 26, 1956 [1].

The mortgagor died, and the petitioners, spouses Salazar, were approved as creditors of his estate [2]. On May 24, 1956, claiming no redemption occurred, Meneses executed a deed of sale in her favor, which was registered on May 26, 1956, leading to the issuance of a new title in her name [2, 3]. On October 1, 1956, the Salazars filed a suit to annul the deed and compel Meneses to allow them to redeem the property [3]. The lower court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the redemption period had expired [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the one-year redemption period for extrajudicially foreclosed registered land begins from the date of registration of the certificate of sale.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the redemption period starts from the date of registration, not the date of the auction sale [5, 6].

The Court relied on the ruling in *Agbulos v. Alberto*, emphasizing that for property under the Land Registration Act, the "operative act" conveying the land is the registration of the deed [7]. Under Section 50 of Act No. 496, a deed does not take effect as a conveyance or bind the land until registered [7]. Consequently, pursuant to Section 24, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, the certificate of sale must be registered [8].

Citing *Garcia v. Ocampo*, the Court reiterated that the twelve-month redemption period begins to run "from the time of registration of the sale in the office of the register of deeds" [8]. Since the certificate of sale in this case was registered only on May 26, 1956, the petitioners' attempt to redeem in October 1956 was well within the one-year period [4, 6].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, the final Deed of Sale is **ANNULLED**, and the respondent is **ORDERED** to permit the appellants to redeem the property within 30 days from the finality of the decision [6].
