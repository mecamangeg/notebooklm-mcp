I. CAPTION
EMILIANO M. PEREZ v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, LUIS P. REYES, AMANDA REYES and SHERIFF OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-20783, August 31, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Perez filed an ejectment complaint against Respondents Luis and Amanda Reyes (sublessees) in the Municipal Court of Manila [1]. The court ruled in favor of Perez, ordering Respondents to vacate and pay back rentals [1]. Respondents appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) [1]. The CFI ordered execution pending appeal because Respondents failed to file a supersedeas bond and allegedly failed to pay accruing rents correctly [1].

Respondents filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA) to challenge the execution order [2]. The CA issued a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction on January 22, 1963, restoring possession of the premises to Respondents [2, 3]. Perez filed the instant petition (L-20783) with the Supreme Court to annul this preliminary writ [3]. However, on January 28, 1963, the CA promulgated its decision in the main case, permanently annulling the CFI's execution order and making the mandatory injunction permanent [3]. Perez filed a second petition (L-20937) to review this final CA decision, but the Supreme Court dismissed it for lack of merit [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court should review the propriety of the preliminary mandatory injunction issued by the Court of Appeals.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the issue regarding the preliminary mandatory injunction was impliedly resolved by the dismissal of the second case (L-20937) [5]. The preliminary writ challenged in the instant petition was superseded by the permanent writ issued in the CA's final decision [4, 5]. Since the Supreme Court already declined to review the permanent injunction in the second case, there is no reason to review the propriety of the preliminary one, which has become *functus officio* [4-6]. The Court clarified that this dismissal only affirms the CA's discretion to preserve the *status quo* pending the main appeal in the CFI and does not constitute a finding on the merits of the ejectment case [7].

The petition is **DISMISSED** and the writ of preliminary injunction previously issued is dissolved [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
