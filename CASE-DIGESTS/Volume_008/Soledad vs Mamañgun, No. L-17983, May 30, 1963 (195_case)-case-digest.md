I. CAPTION
LEONCIO SOLEDAD v. PAULO MAMAÑGUN, G.R. No. L-17983, May 30, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Soledad filed a complaint in the Municipal Court of Manila. On November 25, 1958, defendant Mamañgun filed a Motion to Dismiss (MTD), arguing the court lacked jurisdiction because the complaint failed to allege illegal withholding of possession (unlawful detainer) and the amount claimed exceeded the court's jurisdiction [1]. Before the court resolved the MTD, Soledad filed an amended complaint incorporating the requisite allegations to cure the jurisdictional defect [1]. Mamañgun opposed, arguing the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the amendment since it lacked jurisdiction over the original complaint. The Municipal Court admitted the amendment and ruled in favor of Soledad. On appeal, the Court of First Instance affirmed the admission of the amended complaint, denying Mamañgun's motion to dismiss [2, 3]. Mamañgun appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiff can amend the complaint as a matter of course to cure jurisdictional defects after a Motion to Dismiss is filed but before an Answer.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that under Section 1, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court, a party may amend their pleading once as a *matter of course* at any time before a responsive pleading is served [4, 5]. A **motion to dismiss is not a responsive pleading** [5, 6]. Therefore, the filing of the defendant's motion to dismiss did not deprive the plaintiff of the right to amend the complaint to cure the defects [7]. Since the amendment was a matter of course, there was no need for the court to grant leave for its admission [5]. The Court cited *Paeste v. Juarigue* to support the principle that a pending motion to dismiss does not affect the right to amend [7].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [8].
