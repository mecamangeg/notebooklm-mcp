I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BORROMEO PAGULAYAN and SANTIAGO MATAMMU, G.R. Nos. L-18422-23, July 31, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Santiago Matammu surrendered to the Mayor of San Pablo, Isabela, reporting that he had shot Richard Mesa. He initially executed an affidavit (Exhibit D) before a PC Sergeant claiming self-defense, alleging that Mesa and two others demanded money and threatened him, forcing him to shoot. However, upon further investigation by the NBI, Matammu executed a second statement (Exhibit A) admitting that he and co-accused Borromeo Pagulayan conspired to kill Mesa on the orders of the Mayor, who wanted Mesa "liquidated" for being a notorious character. Pagulayan also executed a statement (Exhibit B) corroborating this conspiracy, detailing how he lured Mesa to Matammu's house where the shooting occurred on January 28, 1959.

The Court of First Instance of Isabela convicted both accused of murder, giving credence to the later confessions (Exhibits A and B) over Matammu's initial self-defense claim. They were sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*. Matammu appealed, insisting his first affidavit claiming self-defense was the true version.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the extrajudicial confessions (Exhibits A and B) are credible and sufficient to sustain a conviction despite the earlier conflicting affidavit.
2. W/N accused Matammu is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the findings of the lower court that Exhibits A and B contained the true version of the incident. The confessions were "interlocking," as they corroborated each other on essential details and were "natural and probable" [1, 2]. There was no evidence that these statements were obtained through violence, intimidation, or promise of reward, nor was there any motive for the NBI officer to concoct the facts [3, 4]. Conversely, Matammu's initial claim of self-defense (Exhibit D) was deemed "not worthy of the slightest credence" because it was riddled with "inherent improbabilities," such as the claim that three heavily armed men fled after a single shot from the accused without returning fire [5, 6].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that Matammu should be credited with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, as he indisputably delivered himself to the authorities immediately after the shooting [7].

**Disposition:** The judgment against Borromeo Pagulayan is **AFFIRMED** (*reclusion perpetua*). The judgment against Santiago Matammu is **MODIFIED** to *reclusion temporal* (14 years, 8 months and 1 day to 17 years, 4 months and 1 day) due to the mitigating circumstance [7].
