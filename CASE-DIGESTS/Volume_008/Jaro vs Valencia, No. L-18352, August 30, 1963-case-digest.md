I. CAPTION
AMADO BELLA JARO v. HON. ELPIDIO VALENCIA, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-18352, August 30, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Dr. Amado Bella Jaro was the municipal health officer of Cateel, Davao. Originally appointed as a temporary physician in 1946, he was later extended a permanent appointment on December 13, 1949, as "Physician in the Municipal Maternity and Charity Clinics, Bureau of Hospitals" after passing the School Physician Examination [1, 2]. This new appointment contained a notation stating it was "to legalize [his] transfer from Batulaki, Davao to Cateel" [2].

Due to strained relations and political conflicts with the Mayor of Cateel, which included mutual lawsuits, the Director of Health Services issued Special Order No. 2 on February 17, 1959, temporarily assigning Jaro to Padada, Davao in the interest of public service [3, 4]. Jaro refused to comply, claiming his appointment was for a specific station (Cateel) and could not be transferred without his consent [5]. He filed a petition for mandamus. The Court of First Instance of Davao ruled in Jaro's favor, declaring the transfer order null and void and ordering the payment of his back salaries [5, 6]. The respondents appealed [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Dr. Jaro's permanent appointment was to a specific station (Cateel, Davao) such that he could not be transferred without his consent.
2. W/N Dr. Jaro is liable to return the salaries he received while staying in Manila pending the resolution of his transfer.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that Dr. Jaro's appointment was not to a specific station but generally as a "Physician in the Municipal Maternity and Charity Clinics, Bureau of Hospitals" [7]. The notation regarding the legalization of his transfer to Cateel merely validated his physical move at the time and did not convert his appointment into one with a definite, fixed place [8]. Under *Miclat v. Ganaden*, an appointment to a central office or general position without a specific station allows the appointee to be assigned to any place where their services are needed in the interest of the service [9]. Furthermore, Commonwealth Act No. 704 and Republic Act No. 1082 do not contemplate fixed stations for such physicians [10]. Consequently, the Secretary of Health had the power to transfer him to Padada to utilize his services more effectively, especially given the friction in Cateel [11, 12].

2. **NO.** The Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the government's counterclaim for the return of salaries Jaro received while staying in the Manila office instead of reporting to Padada [13]. The Court reasoned that he was never formally suspended nor on leave, and the evidence was insufficient to prove he did not perform any official work during that period [13].

**Decision reversed** regarding the validity of the transfer order; **affirmed** regarding the dismissal of the counterclaim [14].
