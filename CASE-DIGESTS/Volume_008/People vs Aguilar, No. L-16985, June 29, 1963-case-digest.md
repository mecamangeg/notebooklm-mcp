I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AQUILINO AGUILAR, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16985, June 29, 1963, 8 Phil. 387, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On the early morning of March 21, 1958, spouses Sulpicio and Concesa Olario were awakened by three intruders in their home in Medina, Misamis Oriental [1]. Concesa recognized Aquilino Aguilar, a friend of her father, who was unmasked, while the other two, later identified as Esteban Pacudan and Pedrito Aguilar, were masked up to their noses [1]. The intruders demanded money, and after taking P30.00, they shot Sulpicio, causing his death [1, 2]. Concesa escaped through a window and shouted for help [1]. The Court of First Instance convicted the three accused of robbery with homicide, sentencing Aquilino and Pacudan to life imprisonment and Pedrito (a minor) to an indeterminate penalty [3]. The accused appealed, relying primarily on the defense of alibi [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over the positive identification of the accused by the prosecution witnesses.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the defense of alibi cannot merit weight and consideration against the positive identification by the widow, Concesa Olario, which was corroborated by the testimony of a disinterested neighbor [5]. Although two of the assailants were masked, the witness gave a good description of their physical condition, allowing her to unhesitatingly identify them during the investigation [6]. The Court held that alibi is weak especially when the accused's alleged locations were not so far-distant as to make their presence at the crime scene physically impossible [5].

Finding the aggravating circumstances of nighttime and dwelling without any offsetting mitigating circumstances, the Court modified the judgment and imposed the death penalty on Aquilino Aguilar and Esteban Pacudan [7]. The sentence for Pedrito Aguilar was affirmed [7].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed with modification; the supreme penalty of death is imposed upon Aquilino Aguilar and Esteban Pacudan.
