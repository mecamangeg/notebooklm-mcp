**I. CAPTION**
MELECIO R. DOMINGO v. HON. LORENZO C. GARLITOS and SIMEONA K. PRICE, G.R. No. L-18994, June 29, 1963, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
In *Domingo v. Moscoso* (1960), the Supreme Court declared final an order for the Intestate Estate of Walter Scott Price to pay P40,058.55 in estate and inheritance taxes, charges, and penalties [1]. To enforce this, the Fiscal filed a petition for execution of judgment on June 21, 1961 [1]. Respondent Judge Garlitos denied the execution, finding that the Government was indebted to the Estate in the amount of P262,200 for services rendered by the Leyte Cadastral Survey, Inc. (represented by the Administratrix) [1]. This Government debt had been recognized and an amount was appropriated for it under Republic Act No. 2700 [2, 3]. The Judge ordered the tax liability to be deducted from the amount due to the Estate [2]. Petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus to annul these orders and compel execution [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the proper procedure to enforce the tax judgment against the estate is through a writ of execution.
2. W/N the estate taxes due to the Government and the Government's indebtedness to the Estate are extinguished by legal compensation.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The ordinary procedure to settle claims against a deceased person's estate is to present a claim before the probate court for an order directing the administrator to pay, rather than through a writ of execution [5]. The Court, citing *Aldamiz v. Judge*, held that execution is not justifiable because during the pendency of proceedings, the estate is in *custodia legis* [5, 6].

2. **YES.** The Court held that compensation takes place by operation of law in accordance with **Articles 1279 and 1290 of the Civil Code** [3]. Since the probate court found that the Government's debt to the Estate was recognized and appropriated for by law (Rep. Act No. 2700), both the claim for taxes and the claim for services were overdue, demandable, and fully liquidated [3]. Consequently, both debts are extinguished to the concurrent amount [3].

The petition is dismissed [7].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
J.B.L. Reyes, J., concurs in the result [7].
