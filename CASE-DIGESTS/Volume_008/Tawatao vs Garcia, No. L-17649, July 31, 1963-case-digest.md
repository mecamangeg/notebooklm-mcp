I. CAPTION
ESTEBAN TAWATAO and LOURDES DEL ROSARIO v. EUGENIO GARCIA, VIRGINIA DE VERA and HON. LEON P. DACAYO, G.R. No. L-17649, July 31, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Garcia and De Vera were tenants of a nipa land in Binmaley, Pangasinan, owned by the spouses Claudio and Tawatao since 1935. In 1950, the parties agreed to convert the land into a fishpond, sharing the expenses and harvest equally. In 1955, the owners leased the fishpond to a third party, dispossessing the respondents. Subsequently, in 1956, the owners donated the fishpond *propter nuptias* to the petitioners, their son Esteban Tawatao and his wife, who took possession and refused to reinstate the respondents.

On February 14, 1958, respondents filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) for reinstatement and damages. Petitioners moved to dismiss, arguing that the CAR lacked jurisdiction because fishponds are not "agricultural lands" subject to cultivation under the Agricultural Tenancy Act (R.A. No. 1199) and that the action was barred by prescription or laches having been filed three years after dispossession. The CAR ruled in favor of respondents, ordering their reinstatement and the payment of damages. Petitioners filed this petition for certiorari to annul the judgment.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction over tenancy disputes involving fishponds.
2. W/N the action for reinstatement is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction. Republic Act No. 1199, as amended by Republic Act No. 2263, applies to fishponds. The Supreme Court held that the law does not require actual cultivation of the land in the strict sense for tenancy relations to fall under its coverage. While Section 46 of the Act provides that consideration for the use of fishponds is governed by stipulation, this does not divest the CAR of jurisdiction over tenancy disputes involving such landholdings. Citing *Molina v. Rafferty* and *Banaag v. Singson Encarnacion*, the Court reiterated that land in which fish is produced is classified as agricultural land and that the term "real estate" includes fisheries.

2. **NO.** The action is not barred. The jurisdiction of the CAR to order reinstatement does not depend on the existence of tenancy relations at the time the action is filed. Furthermore, R.A. No. 1199 does not provide a prescriptive period within which to file a complaint for unlawful dispossession. Consequently, the filing of the action three years after the respondents were dispossessed does not negate the existence of tenancy relations nor constitute a waiver of their right to reinstatement.

The petition for certiorari is DENIED.
