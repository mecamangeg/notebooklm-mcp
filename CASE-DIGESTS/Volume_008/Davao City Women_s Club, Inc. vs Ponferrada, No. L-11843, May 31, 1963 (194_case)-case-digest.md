**I. CAPTION**
**DAVAO CITY WOMEN'S CLUB, INC., also known as DAVAO WOMEN'S CLUB v. REMEDIOS PONFERRADA and THE PROVINCE OF DAVAO**, G.R. No. L-11843, May 31, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
On September 26, 1947, the Provincial Board of Davao donated Lot 72-A to the Women's Club of Davao (the Club). Shortly after, the Board approved Remedios Ponferrada's application to lease a portion of the same lot, subject to the execution of a formal contract. Upon realizing the conflict, the Board initially revoked both the donation and the lease but subsequently passed Resolution No. 146 on March 2, 1948, donating the entire lot to the Club again. The deed was executed, accepted, and approved by the Secretary of the Interior, leading to the issuance of a Torrens title in the Club's name on January 10, 1950.

Later, the Office of the President, acting on Ponferrada’s representation that she had built a house on the lot, suggested allowing her to lease the portion to recoup construction costs. The Board attempted to segregate the portion for Ponferrada, but the Provincial Fiscal refused to draft the lease contract because the property was already owned by the Club. The Club filed an ejectment suit. The Province of Davao challenged the donation's validity, arguing the "Women's Club of Davao" had no juridical personality at the time of donation as the "Davao City Women's Club, Inc." was only incorporated in 1952. The trial court ruled in favor of the Club.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the donation to the Women's Club is valid despite the Province's claim that the donee lacked juridical personality.
2. W/N Ponferrada has a valid lease right over the property.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the Province of Davao is estopped from questioning the Club's capacity. Having approved the donation and the documents giving it effect, the Province cannot allege the incapacity of the donee to enter into the contract. The Court applied **Article 1302 of the Civil Code** (Spanish Civil Code of 1889), which states that persons *sui juris* (capable of giving consent) cannot avail themselves of the incapacity of those with whom they contracted to annul the contract. Furthermore, the Court found that "Women's Club of Davao" and "Davao City Women's Club, Inc." referred to the same organization. Regarding the approval process, the Court held that while the donation was subject to the President's approval, the approval by the Secretary of the Interior was sufficient under **Section 2596 of the Revised Administrative Code**.

2. **NO.** Ponferrada acquired no rights as a lessee. The resolutions granting her lease application were expressly revoked by Resolution No. 70. Moreover, the grant was subject to a suspensive condition—the execution of a formal contract by the Provincial Fiscal—which was never fulfilled. The subsequent suggestion from the Office of the President to grant her a lease could not amend a donation that was already accepted, approved, and fully operative.

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed.
