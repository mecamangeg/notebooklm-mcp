I. CAPTION
LIGAYA MINA, et al. v. ANTONIA PACSON, CRISPINO MEDINA, and CRESENCIA MINA, G.R. No. L-17828, August 31, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants, claiming to be the illegitimate children of the deceased Joaquin Mina, filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 3296) against Joaquin's widow, Antonia Pacson, and the spouses Crispino Medina and Cresencia Mina [1, 2]. They sought recognition of their filiation, damages, and the annulment of deeds of sale executed by Joaquin in favor of the Medina spouses, alleging the sales were fictitious and fraudulent [2].

Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of *res judicata*, citing the dismissal of a previous case (Civil Case No. 3015) filed by the same plaintiffs against the Medina spouses involving the same properties [3]. In Case 3015, the trial court had ordered the plaintiffs to amend their complaint to implead the widow Pacson as an indispensable party [4]. The plaintiffs failed to comply with this order, resulting in the dismissal of Case 3015 [5]. The trial court in the present case (Case 3296) sustained the motion to dismiss [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the previous case bars the present action on the ground of *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
**PARTIALLY YES and PARTIALLY NO.**

**YES, as to the action for annulment of the deeds of sale against the Medina spouses.** The dismissal of the previous case was valid under Rule 30, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, which authorizes dismissal when a plaintiff fails to comply with a court order to implead indispensable parties [7, 8]. The Court rejected the appellants' claim that they should not suffer for their lawyer's negligence, reiterating the doctrine that the client is bound by the action of their counsel [9]. Since the dismissal in the first case was due to the plaintiffs' refusal to comply with an express mandate, it bars the subsequent action for annulment against the same defendants [7, 10].

**NO, as to the action for recognition of filiation against Antonia Pacson.** The doctrine of *res judicata* requires complete identity of parties and subject matter [10]. Antonia Pacson was not a party in the previous case, nor was the issue of the plaintiffs' filiation raised therein [10]. Consequently, the previous order of dismissal does not bar the present complaint regarding the action for recognition of filiation against the widow [10].

**Disposition:** The order of dismissal is **MODIFIED**. The action for the recognition of the filiation of the plaintiffs is allowed to continue against defendant Antonia Pacson; the dismissal of the action for the annulment of the deeds of sale is **AFFIRMED**.
