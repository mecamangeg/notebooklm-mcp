I. CAPTION
EMILIO M. LUMONTAD, JR. v. PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR, PROVINCIAL BOARD, et al., G.R. No. L-17568, May 30, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lumontad, the Municipal Mayor of Pinamungajan, Cebu, faced an administrative complaint filed by the Vice-Mayor and Municipal Councilors before the respondent Provincial Governor and Provincial Board. The complaint charged Lumontad with violating Section 12 of Republic Act No. 917 by disbursing the Highway Special Fund without a program of work formulated by the Municipal Council, utilizing said funds for unauthorized purposes including the reconstruction of a public building used as his residence, and employing "camineros" (road workers) in his office [1-3].

Lumontad filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu to restrain the respondents from investigating him. He argued that under RA 917, the Secretary of Public Works and Communications has exclusive authority over irregularities involving the Highway Special Fund, and that the law provides its own remedy (withholding of aid) [4, 5]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the charges fell within the Provincial Governor's supervisory authority [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Provincial Governor and Provincial Board have jurisdiction to investigate administrative charges against a Municipal Mayor regarding the misuse of the Highway Special Fund under RA 917.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that Section 12 of Republic Act No. 917 only prescribes the conditions for expending the fund and authorizes the Secretary of Public Works and Communications to withhold aid if funds are misused. It does not regulate the procedure for disciplining erring officials and is not inconsistent with the supervisory authority of the Provincial Governor over municipal officers under Section 2188 of the Revised Administrative Code [7].

Under Section 2188, the Governor is empowered to investigate complaints against municipal officers for "neglect of duty, oppression, corruption or other form of maladministration of office" [8]. As the chief executive of the municipality, the Mayor has the duty under Section 2194 of the Revised Administrative Code to ensure laws are faithfully executed [9]. By depriving the Municipal Council of the opportunity to formulate the program of work as required by RA 917, and by allegedly using public funds for his residence, the petitioner committed acts that may constitute neglect of duty, corruption, or maladministration, which are proper subjects of the Governor's disciplinary jurisdiction [3, 9].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [10].
