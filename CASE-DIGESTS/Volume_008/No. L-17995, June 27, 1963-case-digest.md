I. CAPTION
RODOLFO GIRON, MIGUEL BALANCE, and MAXIMA VDA. DE ANTISODA v. HON. HERMOGENES CALUAG, HON. NICASIO YATCO, and J. M. TUASON & CO., INC., G.R. No. L-17995, June 27, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent J. M. Tuason & Co., Inc. filed three separate civil cases for recovery of possession of land against petitioners Rodolfo Giron, Miguel Balance, and Maxima Vda. de Antisoda in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, presided by respondents Judge Caluag and Judge Yatco [1]. The judges delegated the reception of evidence to commissioners. Petitioners allege this was done without proper orders of reference or oaths, and decisions were rendered without commissioner reports or notice/hearing on such reports, violating the Rules of Court [2].

For petitioners Antisoda and Balance, judgments were rendered against them. They filed notices of appeal, but their amended records on appeal were disapproved for being filed late. They subsequently filed petitions for certiorari and mandamus with the Court of Appeals (CA) assailing the disapproval of their appeals and the alleged irregularities regarding the commissioners [3-5]. The CA dismissed these petitions, affirming the regularity of the proceedings, and those decisions became final and executory [6-8].

For petitioner Giron, he did not appeal the decision rendered against him in Civil Case No. Q-4560. He allowed the judgment to become final and executory before joining this present petition for certiorari, alleging the same procedural irregularities regarding the commissioner [9, 10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the causes of action of petitioners Antisoda and Balance are barred by *res judicata*.
2. W/N certiorari is the proper remedy for petitioner Giron to annul the trial court's decision based on alleged procedural irregularities.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the causes of action of Antisoda and Balance are barred by the prior decisions of the Court of Appeals. The parties, subject matter, and cause of action in the present case and the CA cases are identical regarding the alleged irregularities. Since the CA decisions dismissing their petitions are final and executory, *res judicata* applies [8].

2. **NO.** The trial court had undisputed jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter; thus, its decision is valid [10]. If irregularities were committed in the proceedings (such as the delegation to a commissioner) affecting substantial rights, the proper remedy was to file a motion for reconsideration and, if denied, to appeal [10]. Giron failed to avail of these remedies within the reglementary period. The Court reiterated the doctrine that when a decision becomes final due to a party's deliberate inaction, they cannot avail of the writ of certiorari as a substitute for a lost appeal [10].

Petition dismissed [11].
