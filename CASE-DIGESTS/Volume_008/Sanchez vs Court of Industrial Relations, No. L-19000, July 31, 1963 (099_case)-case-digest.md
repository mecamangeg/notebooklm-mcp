I. CAPTION
RUPERTO SANCHEZ, doing business under the name and style of PRESERVER SHOE COMPANY and MODESTO SANCHEZ v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, PRESERVER SHOE WORKERS' UNION-NAFLU, FRANCISCO TORRIGOZA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19000, July 31, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Ruperto and Modesto Sanchez, doing business as Preserver Shoe Company, manufactured shoes for agencies like the Armed Forces of the Philippines based on contracts secured through public bidding. They claimed they employed workers only temporarily for the duration of each contract, and that the employment of respondent workers ceased upon the completion of their last contract on May 17, 1958.

However, records showed that the respondent Union was organized on April 8, 1958. On May 19, 1958, union officers presented bargaining proposals to petitioners. Petitioners subsequently dismissed the union president, Francisco Torrigoza, on May 19, and another member, Julian Regente, on May 21. The Union declared a strike on May 21, 1958, and filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practices (ULP). The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled in favor of the Union, ordering reinstatement and back wages. It found that the employer-employee relationship did not terminate on May 17, 1958, as workers were historically kept in the factory between contracts to await the next bidding. Petitioners appealed, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction because the employment relationship had already ended.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations had jurisdiction over the case based on the existence of an employer-employee relationship.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's decision, holding that the lower court's finding regarding the existence of the employer-employee relationship was supported by **substantial evidence**. The Court noted that the CIR is governed by the rule of substantial evidence rather than the rule of preponderance of evidence used in ordinary civil cases (citing *Iloilo Chinese Commercial School v. Fabrigar*).

Here, the evidence showed that many respondent workers had been employed by petitioners for several years (some since 1947), contradicting the claim of purely temporary employment. The "Application and Contract Work" forms relied upon by petitioners were found to be dubious, as they were undated and unnotarized. The CIR correctly determined that the relationship was not severed upon the completion of the specific shoe contract on May 17, 1958, but continued as workers awaited new contracts. Since the employer-employee relationship subsisted at the time of the ULP acts and the strike, the CIR had proper jurisdiction.

The decision appealed from is hereby affirmed.
