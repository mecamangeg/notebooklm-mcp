I. CAPTION
J. M. TUASON & CO., INC., represented by its Managing Partner, the Gregorio Araneta, Inc. v. DANNY VIBAT, G.R. No. L-18884, May 29, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On January 7, 1959, J. M. Tuason & Co., Inc. filed a plenary action for ejectment and collection of rentals against Danny Vibat in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal [1]. The complaint alleged that Tuason was the registered owner of a parcel of land in Quezon City covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1267, and that in June 1950, Vibat unlawfully entered a 500-square-meter portion through force, strategy, and stealth [1, 2].

Summons was served on April 13, 1959, upon a visitor, Candido Calon, at Vibat's residence while Vibat was in Laguna. Vibat returned on May 10, 1959, and Calon gave him the summons "several days" later [3]. Vibat was declared in default on May 16, 1959, and the trial court rendered judgment against him on June 3, 1959 [4]. On June 23, 1959, Vibat filed a petition for relief from judgment, claiming excusable negligence regarding the summons and a meritorious defense that he purchased the land from one Eustaquio Alquiros [3, 5]. The CFI denied the petition for failure to comply with Rule 38 [6]. Vibat appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for relief from judgment should be granted based on excusable negligence and a meritorious defense.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the denial of the petition for relief.

First, Vibat failed to act with due diligence. He admitted receiving the summons "several days" after May 10, 1959. Had he made prompt inquiries, he would have discovered the default order of May 16 before the judgment was rendered on June 3, 1959 [4].

Second, Vibat had no meritorious defense. His claim of purchasing the land from Eustaquio Alquiros (who allegedly bought it from Juliana de la Cruz) cannot prevail over Tuason's Torrens title [7]. A Torrens title concludes all controversy over ownership of the land covered by the final decree of registration, and title by adverse possession cannot be acquired against the registered owner under Section 46 of Act 496 [7]. Vibat's remedy, if any, lies only against his immediate vendor [7].

The denial of the petition for relief is affirmed [8].
