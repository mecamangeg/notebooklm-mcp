I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. YAKAN MALAT, G.R. No. L-15255, August 30, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On August 8, 1958, at around 7:30 p.m. in Basilan City, Imam Djaliol was shot and killed while covering a hole in the wall of his house [1]. His widow, Mora Sabdia, immediately focused a flashlight outside the window and positively identified the accused, Yakan Malat, and his brother, Yakan Garcia, standing about five meters away armed with guns [1]. Sabdia immediately informed the victim's sister, Nuhaila, and later the police investigators, that Malat and Garcia were the perpetrators [2-4]. The motive was traced to a land dispute between the accused and a relative of the deceased whom the latter had assisted in filing a complaint [2, 5].

The Court of First Instance of Basilan City convicted Malat of murder and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*, ordering him to indemnify the heirs P6,000.00 [6]. Malat appealed, raising the defense of alibi, claiming he was fishing at sea during the incident [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over the positive identification of the accused.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification by the prosecution witnesses [2, 7]. The Court held that the widow's identification was credible as she named the accused spontaneously and without hesitation immediately after the shooting to the victim's sister, and subsequently to the police investigator [2, 7]. This positive identification was further corroborated by a witness who saw the accused carrying a gun on the way to the crime scene, and by the established motive regarding the land trouble [2, 5].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [8].
