I. CAPTION
DACIANO PALAMI, ET AL. v. POTENCIANO LARRAZABAL, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14882, June 28, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, employees of the Ormoc City government, filed a petition for mandamus for reinstatement after their positions were abolished by the Municipal Board and they were removed by Acting Mayor Larrazabal in 1956 [1]. In March 1958, the presiding judge, Judge Debuque, allowed petitioners to file an amended petition to substitute the incumbent Mayor and include the City of Ormoc as a respondent, initially giving them until March 29 [2]. When they failed to file, Judge Debuque issued a subsequent order on June 4, extending the deadline to June 21 [3]. However, Judge Debuque was transferred and succeeded by Judge Estenzo. Unaware of the June 4 extension order which had been misplaced, Judge Estenzo *motu proprio* dismissed the case on June 18 for lack of interest to prosecute [3]. Petitioners filed their amended petition on June 20 (within the June 21 deadline), but the new judge denied its admission and eventually made the dismissal "with prejudice" [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the successor judge erred in dismissing the petition and disregarding the deadline extension granted by the previous judge.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the dismissal was a reversible error [4]. The previous judge exercised his discretion in granting the petitioners another opportunity (via the June 4 order) to file an amended petition [5]. The Supreme Court established that except for "very weighty reasons," which did not exist in this case, the judge who succeeded the judge who issued the order should not have interfered with the exercise of such discretion [5, 6]. The delay was not entirely attributable to the petitioners, and the previous judge had found sufficient justification to grant the extension [4, 5].

The orders appealed from were set aside and the case was remanded to the court *a quo* for further proceedings [7].
