I. CAPTION
SILVESTRE CUÑADO v. DAVID GAMUS, Mayor of Mabini, DOROTEO MONISA, Municipal Treasurer, and PACIFICO RUIZ, Provincial Auditor; INOCENTES VALLECERA and CRESENCIANO ASA v. DAVID GAMUS, et al., G.R. Nos. L-16782 and L-16783, May 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
In G.R. No. L-16782, Silvestre Cuñado, the permanent Chief of Police of Mabini, Bohol, was suspended on January 19, 1956, and dismissed on February 22, 1956, by Mayor David Gamus based on administrative charges. Cuñado appealed to the Commissioner of Civil Service, who exonerated him and ordered his reinstatement, which occurred on April 17, 1957. Cuñado sought back salaries for the period of his suspension, but Mayor Gamus refused to approve the voucher, arguing the Commissioner's decision did not explicitly authorize it. Respondents also alleged Cuñado abandoned his office by stating he was a "civilian" during a subsequent investigation. The trial court ordered the payment of back salaries but denied damages.

In G.R. No. L-16783, Inocentes Vallecera and Cresenciano Asa, both veterans but non-civil service eligibles, held temporary appointments as policemen. They were similarly dismissed by Mayor Gamus on February 22, 1956, and later exonerated by the Commissioner of Civil Service. Unlike Cuñado, they were not reinstated and were replaced by other non-eligibles. The trial court ordered their reinstatement and payment of back salaries, citing their veteran preference.

Both parties appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the cases to the Supreme Court as they involved pure questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Cuñado abandoned his public office, thereby forfeiting his right to back salaries.
2. W/N the Mayor can be compelled by mandamus to approve the salary voucher despite lack of municipal appropriation.
3. W/N Vallecera and Asa are entitled to reinstatement and back salaries as veterans holding temporary appointments.
4. W/N the petitioners are entitled to damages for the Mayor's refusal to pay or reinstate.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Abandonment of public office must be total and made under circumstances indicating absolute relinquishment (*Summers v. Ozaeta*). Cuñado's refusal to face a second administrative investigation or his remark about being a "civilian" after his initial dismissal did not constitute a clear relinquishment of his position. Having been exonerated, he is entitled to back salaries pursuant to Republic Act No. 557.

2. **YES.** Mandamus is a remedy for official inaction. While the Municipal Council was not impleaded, the specific relief sought was the Mayor's approval of the voucher, which was within his power to perform.

3. **NO.** Vallecera and Asa held temporary appointments under Section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code, which are valid for only three months and are terminable at the pleasure of the appointing power. Although veterans have preferential rights under Republic Act No. 65 and Republic Act No. 1363, they must be certified by the Veterans Board, qualify in a Civil Service examination, and file an application for preference. Petitioners failed to prove compliance with these requisites. Consequently, their terms expired three months after their last appointments, and they had no standing to object to their replacement by other non-eligibles (*Inocentes v. Ribo*; *Quiatchon v. Villanueva*).

4. **NO.** The trial court correctly denied damages as there was no proof Mayor Gamus acted in bad faith. He may have honestly believed he was not authorized to make payments or reinstatements absent explicit instruction from the Civil Service Commissioner.

**Disposition:** The decision in G.R. No. L-16782 (Cuñado) is AFFIRMED. The decision in G.R. No. L-16783 (Vallecera and Asa) is REVERSED, declaring them not entitled to reinstatement or back salaries.
