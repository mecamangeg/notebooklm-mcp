I. CAPTION
IMAN SAHIM (MORO) v. GREGORIO D. MONTEJO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Basilan City, and DOMINGO ALVAREZ, G.R. No. L-15606, June 29, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Domingo Alvarez filed a complaint for recovery of possession of a 4.3475-hectare parcel of public land in Basilan City against petitioner Iman Sahim in November 1950 [1]. The land was the subject of conflicting homestead applications between the parties [2]. The Director of Lands resolved the conflict in favor of Alvarez on June 8, 1951, a decision subsequently affirmed by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources in 1952 and by the Office of the President on July 22, 1957 [2].

Despite these favorable administrative decisions, Alvarez was unable to take possession of the land [3]. In the pending civil case, after presenting his evidence, Alvarez filed a petition for a preliminary mandatory injunction [4]. Respondent Judge Montejo granted the writ on February 27, 1959, placing Alvarez in possession *pendente lite* upon posting a bond, citing the delay in the case [5]. Sahim filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that an injunction cannot be granted to take property out of the possession of one party and place it in another whose title has not been clearly established [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing a preliminary mandatory injunction to transfer possession of the land to the plaintiff *pendente lite*.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the issuance of the injunction was not a grave abuse of discretion [3]. While Articles 539 and 1674 of the Civil Code expressly provide for preliminary mandatory injunctions in forcible entry and ejectment cases, this does not absolutely exclude other cases where, for compelling reasons, the court may exercise its discretion to grant such relief [6].

In this case, compelling reasons existed. The land involved was public domain, and the appropriate executive officials (Director of Lands, Secretary of Agriculture, and the President) had already adjudicated the rights in favor of Alvarez [2]. The Court noted that acts of these officials regarding the disposition of public lands are generally not subject to judicial review [3]. Considering these final administrative decisions and the fact that Alvarez had been deprived of possession for a long time despite them, the trial court properly exercised its discretion [3].

The writ prayed for was denied, and the temporary restraining order issued by the Supreme Court was dissolved [7].
