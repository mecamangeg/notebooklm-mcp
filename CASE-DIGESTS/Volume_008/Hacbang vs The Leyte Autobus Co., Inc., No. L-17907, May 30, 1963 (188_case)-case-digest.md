I. CAPTION
JOAQUIN HACBANG and CASTOR BARDELOSA v. THE LEYTE AUTOBUS COMPANY, INC. and HON. CLEMENTINO V. DIEZ, G.R. No. L-17907, May 30, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Otilla Bustillo and her children obtained a judgment for a sum of money against defendant Leyte Autobus Co., Inc. in Civil Case No. 2045 before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte. Pursuant to a writ of execution, Petitioners Hacbang and Bardelosa (Provincial Sheriffs of Leyte) levied upon a passenger bus. Respondent Leyte Autobus Co., Inc. filed a third-party claim, alleging it was a different entity from the judgment debtor. The CFI of Leyte denied the claim and ordered the auction sale of the bus.

On the date of the scheduled sale, Respondent Company filed a separate action (Civil Case No. R-6542) in the CFI of Cebu against the sheriffs, seeking to enjoin the sale. Respondent Judge Diez of the CFI of Cebu issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the sheriffs from proceeding with the auction in Leyte. The sheriffs moved to dismiss, arguing the CFI of Cebu lacked jurisdiction to restrain the execution of a judgment by the CFI of Leyte, but the motion was denied.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance of Cebu has jurisdiction to issue a writ of injunction to restrain the execution of a judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance of Leyte.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the CFI of Cebu acted without jurisdiction. It is settled that no court has the power to interfere by injunction with the judgments or decrees of a court of concurrent or coordinate jurisdiction (*Cabigao v. Del Rosario*).

When property is levied upon to satisfy a writ of execution, it is brought into *custodia legis* under the sole control of the issuing court (CFI of Leyte). That court exercises exclusive jurisdiction over the property, and no other court, except one with supervisory control, may interfere (*National Power Corporation v. De Veyra*). Furthermore, the jurisdiction of a Court of First Instance to issue writs of injunction is limited to acts committed or about to be committed within its territorial boundaries (*Acosta v. Alvendia*). Consequently, the CFI of Cebu had no authority to restrain acts performed in Leyte. While the CFI of Cebu may hear the separate case regarding ownership and damages, it cannot stop the execution sale ordered by the CFI of Leyte.

The writ of preliminary injunction issued by the respondent Judge is set aside and annulled, and the writ issued by the Supreme Court is made permanent.
