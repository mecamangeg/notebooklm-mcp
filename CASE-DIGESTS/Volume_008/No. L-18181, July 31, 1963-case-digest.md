I. CAPTION
INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED GENEROSO DE GALA, ILUMINADA DE GALA-SISON v. SOCORRO MANALO, G.R. No. L-18181, July 31, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Generoso de Gala, a wealthy resident of Candelaria, Quezon, died in an airplane crash on Mt. Banahaw on December 14, 1946, along with his son [1]. Iluminada de Gala-Sison was appointed administratrix of the intestate estate and submitted an inventory of properties [1]. Socorro Manalo filed an opposition, claiming that certain valuable jewelry listed in her "Exhibit Y" were omitted from the inventory [1]. The administratrix contended that the jewelry was lost in the crash [2].

The Court of First Instance of Quezon (Judge Vicente Santiago) issued an order on August 29, 1952, declaring that the jewelry was not lost—noting it was shown to relatives four days after the burial—and directed its inclusion in the inventory [3, 4]. The court also ordered the administratrix to deposit the cash in her possession, amounting to P40,938.56, with a reputable banking institution [3]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's findings regarding the existence of the jewelry [5, 6]. The petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court via certiorari, arguing lack of evidence for the jewelry's existence and claiming estoppel because some small items found in the wreckage were previously claimed by the estate [2, 5, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals regarding the existence of the jewelry are binding on the Supreme Court.
2. W/N the order requiring the administratrix to deposit the cash in a bank is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The findings of fact of the lower court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are binding on the Supreme Court and cannot be disturbed on appeal [7, 8]. The record supported the finding that the jewelry existed after the death of the intestate; witnesses testified that Iluminada exhibited the jewelry to her stepmother and sister-in-law after the crash [4]. The Court found the petitioner's claim that the jewelry was lost in the crash implausible, as the items recovered from the wreckage were of insignificant value compared to the valuable pieces listed in "Exhibit Y" [9, 10]. Consequently, the order to file an amended inventory including the jewelry was proper [11].

2. **YES.** The order directing the administratrix to deposit the cash is within the discretionary power of the court and is the only proper step to safeguard the trust fund [12]. However, the specific amount to be deposited must be modified. Since the administratrix had already incurred approved expenses of P1,698.41 and was previously ordered to distribute shares to the heirs, the deposit order is modified to include only the balance of the original P40,938.56 remaining after deducting court-approved expenses, allowances, and inheritances delivered to the widow and heirs [13, 14].

**Disposition:** The first order appealed from is affirmed; the second order is modified. [15]
