I. CAPTION
EMMA S. ACENAS and ALBERTO E. ACENAS v. ANGELA SISON and TEOFILO SISON, G.R. No. L-17011, August 30, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
In September 1956, Angela Sison executed a promissory note promising to pay Emma Acenas P8,160.00 in installments [1]. Upon Angela's failure to pay the balance of P8,391.60, Spouses Acenas filed a suit against her [1]. Her husband, Teofilo Sison, was joined as a defendant pursuant to Article 113 of the Civil Code [1]. Teofilo denied liability, asserting he did not sign the note [2].

During the hearing on March 7, 1960, the defendants' counsel, Atty. Nicanor S. Sison, moved for postponement to confer with his clients for a possible settlement [2], [3]. When the trial court indicated the defendants seemingly had no defense, Atty. Sison agreed to a confession of judgment against his clients, provided the writ of execution would be suspended until June 30, 1960 [2]. The Court of First Instance rendered judgment ordering the defendants to pay the debt jointly and severally [4]. Teofilo appealed, contending his lawyer lacked authority to confess judgment and that he was not liable for his wife's debt [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the counsel had the authority to confess judgment on behalf of his client.
2. W/N the husband is solidarily liable for his wife's promissory note by virtue of his joinder in the suit.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the counsel lacked the authority to confess judgment. Section 21 of Rule 127 of the Rules of Court expressly requires attorneys to have special authority to compromise their client's litigation [5], [6]. The Court held that compromise of causes and confession of judgments stand on the same footing [5], [7]. The record showed that the counsel moved for postponement specifically to "confer" with his clients, which logically deduced a lack of existing authority to confess judgment at that time [8], [3]. The trial court erred in accepting the confession without ascertaining the lawyer's authority [5], [9].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the law requires the joinder of the husband not to bind him with his wife, but because he is the administrator of the conjugal partnership [10]. Making the husband solidarily liable solely due to this joinder would subvert the rule that a wife cannot bind the conjugal partnership without the husband's consent under Article 172 of the Civil Code [11], [10]. Exceptions apply only if the husband consents, if the expense is for the family's daily needs (Art. 115), or if the wife manages the partnership (Arts. 157, 168, 178, 196), none of which were alleged [12], [10].

The decision was **MODIFIED**; Teofilo Sison is declared not liable, and Angela Sison is held solely liable to the plaintiffs [13].
