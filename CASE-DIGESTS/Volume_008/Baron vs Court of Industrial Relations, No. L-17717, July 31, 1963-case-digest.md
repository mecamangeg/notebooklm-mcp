I. CAPTION
UBALDO BARON, TEOFILO CANO, LORENZO DE LA CRUZ, MANUEL GUTIERREZ, JULIO PEREZ, ET AL. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, CHENG BAN YEK & COMPANY, INC., OPERATOR AND OWNER OF INTERNATIONAL OIL FACTORY and INTERNATIONAL OIL FACTORY WORKERS UNION (FFW), G.R. No. L-17717, July 31, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were employees of respondent Cheng Ban Yek & Company, Inc. On May 11, 1951, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) rendered a partial decision ordering the company to grant: (1) a P0.50 general daily wage increase effective January 4, 1949, to avoid discrimination; and (2) a 10% increase for those earning between P5.00 and P7.00 daily [1, 2]. The company implemented the 10% increase based on the employees' *old* salaries, excluding the P0.50 general increase [3].

Subsequently, petitioners were expelled from respondent Union and dismissed by the company in November 1957 pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) after they questioned union officials' actions [4, 5]. The CIR found the expulsion illegal for lack of due process but found the company acted in good faith in dismissing them upon the Union's demand. Consequently, the CIR *en banc* modified the relief from reinstatement to merely a "priority right to re-employment," noting that permanent replacements had already been hired [6]. Petitioners appealed, questioning the salary computation and the denial of full reinstatement [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 10% wage increase should be computed based on the salary adjusted by the P0.50 general increase.
2. W/N the petitioners are entitled to full reinstatement with backwages.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The 10% increase must be computed based on the adjusted salary (old salary + P0.50). The Court reasoned that the P0.50 increase was originally granted to correct a previous discrimination. To follow the company's computation based on the old, discriminated salaries would effectively discontinue the P0.50 increase and revive the discrimination the court sought to avoid [7]. Petitioners are entitled to the differential.

2. **NO.** The Court affirmed the CIR's ruling granting only a priority right to reinstatement. Taking into account that the company acted in good faith in dismissing the petitioners upon the respondent Union's petition pursuant to the CBA, and that permanent replacements to their former positions had already been made, the Court found no reason to disturb the lower court's judgment limiting relief to a priority right to re-employment rather than reinstatement with backwages [8].

Petition is **GRANTED IN PART**. The decision is affirmed with modification regarding the salary computation.
