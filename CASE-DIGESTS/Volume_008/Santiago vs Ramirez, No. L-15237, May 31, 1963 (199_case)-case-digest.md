I. CAPTION
MARIA SANTIAGO, ET AL. v. JOSE RAMIREZ, ET AL., and DR. NICOLAS JOAQUIN, G.R. No. L-15237, May 31, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Andres Herrera died in 1937, leaving a homestead covered by OCT No. H-151 to his heirs, the plaintiffs-appellants Santiago et al. In 1949, the heirs entrusted the title to their relative, defendant Jose Ramirez, to find a buyer. Instead, Ramirez and Marcial del Rosario allegedly forged a deed of sale in favor of Marcos Agustin. Agustin subsequently sold the property to defendant-appellee Dr. Nicolas Joaquin, who obtained TCT No. T-5699.

Plaintiffs filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan to annul the sale and cancel Joaquin's title. On January 6, 1958, Joaquin filed a Motion to Dismiss claiming good faith, which the court reserved for trial. On January 23, 1958, Joaquin filed his Answer without mentioning *res judicata*. Months later, Joaquin filed a motion to amend his answer and a second Motion to Dismiss, claiming the case was barred by *res judicata* due to the dismissal of a prior case (Civil Case No. 471) involving similar parties. The CFI admitted the amended answer and dismissed the complaint on the ground of *res judicata*.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the complaint on the ground of *res judicata* was proper.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal.

First, the Court ruled that the defense of *res judicata* was deemed waived. Under Section 10, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court, all defenses not interposed in a motion to dismiss or in an answer are deemed waived. Since the prior case (Civil Case No. 471) existed before Joaquin filed his first motion to dismiss and his original answer, and he failed to raise it in those pleadings, he was barred from raising it in a second motion to dismiss.

Second, the doctrine of *res judicata* was not applicable because the requirement of identity of parties was lacking. Joaquin was not a party in the former case, and his predecessor-in-interest, Marcos Agustin, was never under the jurisdiction of the court in that prior case due to lack of summons.

Finally, the Court emphasized that dispensation of justice should not be barred by technicalities, especially where plaintiffs allege they were fraudulently and criminally deprived of their property. A formal trial is necessary to ventilate the issues.

The Order dismissing the complaint is **SET ASIDE**, and the case is **REMANDED** to the court of origin for further proceedings.
