I. CAPTION
SIMEON DEL ROSARIO v. THE EQUITABLE INSURANCE AND CASUALTY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-16215, June 29, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On February 7, 1957, respondent Equitable Insurance issued a Personal Accident Policy on the life of Francisco del Rosario, binding itself to pay P1,000.00 to P3,000.00 as indemnity for death. Part I of the policy specified amounts for death resulting from "bodily injury" (violent, external, and visible means). A separate rider waived the exception clause regarding drowning in Part VI, effectively covering death by drowning. On February 24, 1957, the insured died by drowning after being forced to jump off the burning launch "ISLAMA."

Petitioner Simeon del Rosario, the father and beneficiary, filed a claim. The respondent paid only P1,000.00, relying on the Insurance Commissioner's opinion that liability was limited under Part I. Contending he was entitled to P3,000.00, Simeon filed a complaint for the P2,000.00 balance. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Simeon, finding that the policy was ambiguous regarding the specific indemnity for drowning and resolving the ambiguity against the insurer. The case was elevated to the Supreme Court on a pure question of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the insured is entitled to the maximum indemnity of P3,000.00 due to ambiguity in the insurance policy.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the decision of the lower court. The policy bound the insurer to pay "P1,000.00 to P3,000.00" but failed to state a specific amount for death by drowning (covered under Part VI via rider), unlike death by bodily injury which had specific amounts under Part I. This created an ambiguity.

Citing **Article 1377 of the New Civil Code**, the Court ruled that the interpretation of obscure stipulations in a contract should not favor the party who caused the obscurity. In insurance contracts, which are typically contracts of adhesion, the insured has little participation in drafting the terms. Therefore, ambiguous terms must be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured. Where two interpretations are possible, the one allowing for greater indemnity will prevail.

**Judgment affirmed.**
