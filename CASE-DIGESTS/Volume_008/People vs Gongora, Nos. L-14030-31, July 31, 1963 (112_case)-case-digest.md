I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ESTANISLAO LLURCA, G.R. Nos. L-14030-31, July 31, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On June 24, 1957, in St. Bernard, Leyte, Epifanio Boncag and his sweetheart Isabel Cortez were intimate near a cemetery. Boncag was suddenly attacked and stabbed by a man he did not recognize in the dark; he fled and survived. Isabel’s lifeless body was found the next day in a brook near the abandoned house of accused-appellant Estanislao Llurca. Police found a bloody undershirt belonging to Llurca in said house and discovered a human bloodstain under Llurca's thumbnail.

Antonio Gongora, originally a co-accused, was discharged as a state witness. He testified that Llurca borrowed his bolo that night, chased Isabel, and took her to the abandoned house. Llurca denied the charges, claiming alibi and that the blood was from a pig/fish. The Court of First Instance of Leyte convicted Llurca of Murder (for Isabel) and Frustrated Murder (for Boncag). Llurca appealed, questioning the credibility of the state witness and the sufficiency of the circumstantial evidence.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the circumstantial evidence and state witness testimony were sufficient to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
2. W/N the aggravating circumstance of nighttime should be appreciated separately from treachery in the frustrated murder case.
3. W/N the mitigating circumstance of intoxication should be appreciated in favor of the accused.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, citing three "vital considerations" unexplained by the defense that identified Llurca as the perpetrator: (1) the bloody undershirt found in his family's abandoned house; (2) the human bloodstain found under his thumbnail, which he falsely claimed was animal blood; and (3) the presence of motive on his part (as a former suitor of the victim) and the lack thereof for the state witness Gongora. While testimony of a co-accused turned state witness must be received with "great caution," Gongora's account was substantially corroborated by these circumstances.

2. **YES.** In the frustrated murder case, the attack was sudden and unexpected, constituting treachery. The Court ruled that "the aggravating circumstance of nighttime cannot be considered for the purpose of increasing the penalty as the same is absorbed in the treachery."

3. **YES.** The Court found that the appellant was under the influence of liquor immediately preceding the incident and there was no evidence he was a habitual drunkard. Thus, the mitigating circumstance of intoxication was granted.

The judgment for Murder was affirmed (Life Imprisonment). The judgment for Frustrated Murder was affirmed with modification regarding the indeterminate sentence.
