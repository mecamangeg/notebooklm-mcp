I. CAPTION
EMIGDIO SORIANO and BEATRIZ DE VERA v. THE HEIRS OF DOMINGO MAGALI, G.R. No. L-15133, July 31, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Domingo Magali and Modesta Calimlim were the registered owners of a parcel of land covered by Original Certificate of Title (O.C.T.) No. 51878 [1]. In 1939, they sold a portion to Spouses Cerezo, who in turn sold it to Maximino Mamorno in 1941 [1]. These sales were not registered or annotated on the title [1].

In January 1944, Mamorno sold the land back to Modesta Calimlim verbally for P5,000.00, delivering the muniments of title and possession of the land to her [2]. However, on April 5, 1946, Mamorno's widow, Francisca Reyes, sold the same property to petitioners Spouses Soriano and De Vera [1]. Petitioners registered their deeds of sale under Act No. 3344 on April 9, 1946 [1].

Petitioners filed an action for *reivindicacion*. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan ruled in favor of the respondents (Heirs of Magali), finding that Modesta Calimlim had been in continuous possession since 1944 and that the petitioners' registration under Act 3344 was ineffective [1], [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the verbal sale of the land to Modesta Calimlim is valid and enforceable despite the Statute of Frauds.
2. W/N the petitioners' registration of the sale under Act No. 3344 confers a better right of ownership under Article 1544 (rules on double sale).

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the Statute of Frauds applies only to executory contracts of sale, not to those which have been consummated by the delivery of the property to the vendee [4]. In this case, the sale to Modesta Calimlim was consummated by the delivery of the land and the muniments of title in 1944 [2], [4]. Furthermore, evidence of the verbal sale (Exhibit 3) was admitted without objection, granting it probative value [5].

2. **NO.** Under Article 1544 of the Civil Code (formerly Article 1473), if immovable property is sold to different vendees, ownership belongs to the person who in good faith first recorded it in the Registry of Property [6]. However, the petitioners registered their sale under Act No. 3344, which applies only to properties *not* registered under the Land Registration Act [6], [4]. Since the land was registered under the Torrens system (O.C.T. No. 51878), the petitioners' registration under Act 3344 was ineffective and did not bind the land [4]. In the absence of a valid inscription, ownership pertains to the person who in good faith was first in possession [6]. Respondents have been in possession in good faith since 1944, while petitioners never took possession [6].

**Judgment, affirmed.** [7]
