**I. CAPTION**
SILVESTRA DEYMOS VDA. DE OYZON v. HON. DEMETRIO G. VINZON and CATALINO PANAO, G.R. No. L-19360, July 26, 1963, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Silvestra Deymos Vda. de Oyzon filed a civil case for Annulment of Contract against respondent Catalino Panao in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Carigara, Leyte [1]. After the CFI rendered judgment against her on September 26, 1961, petitioner received the decision on October 4, 1961 [1]. On October 18, 1961, within the reglementary period, she filed her Notice of Appeal, Appeal Bond, and Record on Appeal [1].

During the approval hearing, respondent objected, requesting the inclusion of additional documents (e.g., Motion for Ocular Inspection) in the Record on Appeal [2]. The CFI ordered the petitioner to incorporate these documents, stating that upon compliance, the record would be approved *ipso facto*, but did not set a specific deadline [2, 3]. Petitioner filed the Amended Record on Appeal on November 11, 1961, which was 14 days after the order but beyond the original 30-day appeal period [3]. Consequently, the CFI denied approval, ruling that the appeal was not perfected within the mandatory 30-day period [4]. Petitioner filed for Mandamus to compel the judge to approve the record [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the appeal was perfected on time even if the Amended Record on Appeal was filed after the 30-day reglementary period.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the appeal was perfected on time. The Court explained that the CFI's order to amend the record without a fixed deadline implied that compliance should be made within a reasonable time, and the petitioner's compliance within 14 days was reasonable [6]. Furthermore, the filing of the Amended Record on Appeal is deemed to have been filed on the presentation of the original Record on Appeal, which was indisputably filed within the reglementary period [6].

Citing *Phil. Ind. Church v. Mateo*, the Court applied the principle that amendments to pleadings relate back to the date of the original filing [7]. Since the original record was filed on time, the subsequent amendment ordered by the court did not render the perfection untimely [6].

The Petition for Mandamus was GRANTED, the orders denying approval were set aside, and the respondent Judge was ordered to approve the amended record on appeal [8].
