I. CAPTION
RAMON YAP v. FORTUNATA TINGIN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18943, May 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Ramon Yap and defendants Fortunata Tingin, et al. were co-owners of a lot and house in Guagua, Pampanga. In an action for partition (Civil Case No. 991), the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pampanga rendered a decision on March 18, 1957, finding physical division determined to be impracticable [1]. The CFI ordered the defendants to repurchase the plaintiff's 5/6 share within five days from notice by depositing the purchase price with the Clerk of Court [2].

On March 23, 1957, the plaintiff filed a motion seeking reimbursement for expenses paid to the partition commissioners, a relief not included in the original decision [3, 4]. On March 28, 1957, the defendants deposited P7,510.00 with the Clerk of Court, who issued a temporary receipt because the cash officer was absent [5]. The official receipt was issued on April 8, 1957 [5].

Plaintiff filed a "Manifestation Ex-Parte" claiming the defendants failed to deposit within the five-day period, arguing the valid deposit date was April 8, and sought forfeiture of their right to repurchase [6, 7]. On November 19, 1957, the CFI amended the decision to include the reimbursement prayed for by the plaintiff but upheld the defendants' repurchase rights [7]. Plaintiff appealed, contending the deposit was not legally effective until the official receipt was issued, which was past the five-day deadline [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendants' deposit of the purchase price was made within the prescribed period to validly exercise their right of repurchase.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the order of the lower court, holding that the deposit was valid and timely.

The Court reasoned that the defendants substantially complied with the order by depositing the required amount with the Clerk of Court on March 28, 1957, within the five-day period [8]. The issuance of a temporary receipt due to the cash officer's absence was merely to safeguard accountability and did not alter the fact that the defendants took all necessary steps to comply [8].

Furthermore, the plaintiff's motion filed on March 23, 1957, was effectively a motion for reconsideration because it expressly requested a relief (reimbursement of fees) not included in the original decision [9]. This motion suspended the finality of the March 18 decision [10]. Since the decision was not final until the court resolved the motion on November 19, 1957, the deposit made by the defendants—whether reckoned on March 28 or April 8—was clearly made on time [9, 11].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [12].
