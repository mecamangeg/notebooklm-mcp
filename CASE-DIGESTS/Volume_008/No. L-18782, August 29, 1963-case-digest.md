I. CAPTION
BINALBAGAN-ISABELA SUGAR CO., INC. (BISCOM) v. PHILIPPINE ASSOCIATION OF FREE LABOR UNIONS (PAFLU), ET AL., G.R. No. L-18782, August 29, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner BISCOM entered into a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the Fraternal Labor Organization (FLO) on May 3, 1957, which included a closed-shop clause [1]. Two employees, Entila and Tenazas, who were members of FLO, subsequently joined respondent union PAFLU and campaigned for it [2]. Consequently, FLO expelled them for misconduct and BISCOM dismissed them pursuant to the closed-shop provision [2, 3]. PAFLU and the employees filed a complaint for unfair labor practice against BISCOM and FLO [4].

The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled in favor of the employees, ordering their reinstatement [5]. The CIR found that the dismissal was illegal because: (1) the employees were supervisory personnel; (2) they were denied due process during their expulsion; and (3) the CBA was invalid as it was executed while a petition for certification election filed by another union (Visayan Free Workers Union) was pending [5, 6]. BISCOM petitioned for review [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the collective bargaining agreement containing the closed-shop provision was validly executed despite a pending question of majority representation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the CIR's finding that the CBA was illegal because it was entered into with a union that was not certified by the court at a time when the issue of majority representation was disputed [7].

While an employer and employees may conclude a CBA without court intervention, this exception applies "only if there is no dispute as to what union counts in its membership with a majority of its employees" [8]. In this case, a petition for certification election had been filed by another union and was pending before the execution of the CBA [6]. Under such circumstances, a labor union cannot unilaterally determine its majority membership, and the employer must defer the execution of a contract until the court resolves the representation issue [6]. Since the CBA was not concluded in accordance with the law, it could not justify the dismissal of the employees [7].

Petition denied. Decision affirmed.
