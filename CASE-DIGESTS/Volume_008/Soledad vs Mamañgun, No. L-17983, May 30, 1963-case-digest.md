I. CAPTION
LEONCIO SOLEDAD v. PAULO MAMAÑGUN, G.R. No. L-17983, May 30, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Leoncio Soledad filed an action in the Municipal Court of Manila against Paulo Mamañgun to recover unpaid rentals and order him to vacate the leased premises [1]. Mamañgun filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction because the complaint failed to allege that he was "illegally withholding" possession (a requisite for unlawful detainer) and the amount claimed exceeded the court's jurisdiction for simple recovery of money [2]. Before the court could act on the motion, Soledad filed an amended complaint including the requisite allegations to cure the defect [2]. Mamañgun opposed the admission of the amended complaint, contending that since the court had no jurisdiction over the original complaint, it lacked the power to admit the amendment [2]. The Municipal Court denied the motion to dismiss, admitted the amended complaint, and rendered judgment for Soledad [2]. The Court of First Instance affirmed the decision [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiff may amend his complaint as a matter of course to cure jurisdictional defects after a motion to dismiss has been filed but before an answer.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that under Section 1, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court, a party may amend his pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served upon him [5, 6]. The Court held that a motion to dismiss is not a responsive pleading [5, 7]. Therefore, the filing of the motion to dismiss did not deprive the plaintiff of his right to amend his complaint at his pleasure to cure the jurisdictional defect [7].

Decision affirmed [8].
