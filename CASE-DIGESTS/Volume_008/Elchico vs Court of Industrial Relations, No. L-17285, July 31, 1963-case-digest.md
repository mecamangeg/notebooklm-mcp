I. CAPTION
EDUARDO ELCHICO v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, et al., G.R. No. L-17285, July 31, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents, former employees of New Angat-Manila Transportation, were awarded P30,500.69 in overtime and separation pay by the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [1]. The employer appealed the judgment to the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-16283 [1]. While that appeal was pending, the CIR granted a motion requiring the employer to deposit the award amount or post a bond [2, 3]. Petitioner Elchico appealed this specific order via certiorari [2]. Subsequently, on December 27, 1960, the Supreme Court rendered its decision in the main appeal (G.R. No. L-16283), setting aside the CIR's judgment on the ground of lack of jurisdiction [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR order directing the deposit of the award pending appeal should be set aside.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The order must be set aside. In the main case (G.R. No. L-16283), the Supreme Court ruled that the CIR lacked jurisdiction because the respondents did not seek reinstatement, but merely the recovery of compensation [5]. Citing the *PRISCO* case, the Court held that such claims properly belong to the regular courts [5]. Since the principal award for overtime and separation pay was set aside (without prejudice to refiling in the proper court), the ancillary order requiring the deposit of said amount can no longer stand [4].

Order set aside [6].
