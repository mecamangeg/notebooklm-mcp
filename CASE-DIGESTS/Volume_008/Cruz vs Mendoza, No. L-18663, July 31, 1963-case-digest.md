I. CAPTION
CARMEN D. DE CRUZ, ET AL. v. EMILIANA MENDOZA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18663, July 31, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Ernesto Belleza was employed on the ferry boat M/S Cinderella, registered to Marcelo E. Cruz [1]. Marcelo died on August 30, 1954, and his estate was subject to settlement proceedings [1]. On March 22, 1955, while the estate was in the process of liquidation, Belleza was killed in an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment [2, 3]. Respondents (Belleza's heirs) filed a claim for compensation with the Department of Labor on January 25, 1960 [2]. Petitioners (heirs of Marcelo Cruz) moved to dismiss, arguing that under Rule 87 of the Rules of Court, money claims against a decedent must be filed in the probate court within the time limited in the notice, which had already expired [4, 5]. Petitioners further argued the claim had prescribed as it was filed beyond the three-month period required by the Workmen's Compensation Act [6]. Respondents countered that Petitioners had previously paid for burial expenses and advanced partial compensation [7]. The Regional Office denied the motion to dismiss, prompting Petitioners to file a petition for prohibition [8].

III. ISSUES
1. W/N the Workmen's Compensation Commission has jurisdiction over a money claim against the estate of a deceased employer.
2. W/N the claim for compensation has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 3428) is a special law that outlines the requisites and procedure for cases under its coverage [5]. Being a special law covering special cases, it governs to the exclusion of general rules, such as Rule 87 of the Rules of Court regarding claims against an estate [5]. Regular courts may only intervene in the prosecution of workmen's compensation cases for the execution of a final judgment by the Commission [9, 10]. Therefore, the claim was correctly filed with the Regional Office of the Department of Labor and need not be presented in the estate settlement proceedings [11].

2. **NO.** Although the claim was filed beyond the reglementary three-month period from the accident, the complaint alleged that the employer had defrayed burial expenses and paid the claimants P1,230.00 as partial compensation [6]. Under Section 24 of Act No. 3428, as amended, the time limits for making a claim are no longer necessary if the employer has voluntarily made compensation payments [6].

Petition dismissed; orders affirmed [12].
