I. CAPTION
JOSE DE BORJA v. VICENTE G. GELLA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18330, July 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Jose de Borja was delinquent in the payment of his real estate taxes since 1958 for properties located in the City of Manila and Pasay City [1]. He offered to pay these taxes using two negotiable certificates of indebtedness (backpay certificates) Nos. 3064 and 3065 [1]. However, Borja was merely an assignee of said certificates; the original applicants were Rafael Vizcaya and Pablo Batario Luna [1]. The respondents (Treasurers) refused to accept the certificates [2]. Borja filed a petition for mandamus, and the Court of First Instance ruled in his favor, ordering the respondents to accept the certificates and enjoining them from selling his properties [2]. The respondents appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N an assignee of backpay certificates can compel the government to accept them in payment of his real estate taxes.
2. W/N the tax obligation can be extinguished by legal compensation against the backpay certificates.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 2 of Republic Act No. 304, the law allows a backpay certificate holder to pay "his taxes." The Supreme Court held that this implies the tax must be owed by the *applicant himself* [4, 5]. The privilege to use the certificates for tax settlement is restricted to the original applicant and does not extend to an assignee or subsequent holder [5]. The right of an assignee is limited to having the certificate discounted at maturity or negotiating it [6, 7]. Since Borja is a mere assignee, he has no clear legal right to compel acceptance, and thus mandamus does not lie [7].

2. **NO.** Legal compensation under Articles 1278 and 1279 of the Civil Code cannot take place because the parties are not creditors and debtors of each other in their own right [8]. For the certificates, the debtor is the Republic of the Philippines; for the real estate taxes, the creditors are the City of Manila and Pasay City, which possess distinct and separate legal personalities from the Republic [9, 10]. Furthermore, the certificates were not considered "due" and demandable, as the law provides they are redeemable "within ten years," making their maturity date uncertain [10].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, the petition for mandamus is **DISMISSED**, and the injunction is **LIFTED** [11].
