I. CAPTION
CEFERINO DE LOS SANTOS, SR., ET AL. v. SEBASTIAN C. PALANCA, G.R. No. L-17815, August 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Ceferino de los Santos, Sr. and Jr., practicing attorneys, were engaged by defendant Sebastian C. Palanca to represent him in the probate proceedings of his late father’s estate (Sp. Proc. No. 12126). On July 12, 1952, they entered into a written contract stipulating: (1) a P3,000 retainer fee (paid); (2) a "contingent sum of 10% of whatever amount of money or value of property which may be adjudicated" to the defendant; and (3) free services in other cases/incidents yielding "no material benefit."

Plaintiffs rendered services for approximately four years, intervening in the probate case and two other civil cases (No. 22031 and No. 22354). Civil Case No. 22031 (regarding corporate books inspection) resulted in a lower court award of damages and fees but was dismissed on appeal following a settlement. Civil Case No. 22354 was dismissed due to plaintiffs' failure to appear at the hearing. Subsequently, Palanca and his co-heirs concluded an amicable settlement of the estate—using other counsel and without plaintiffs’ direct intervention—wherein Palanca was adjudicated properties worth P922,280.00. Plaintiffs filed suit to collect the 10% contingent fee and other fees. The trial court dismissed the claim for the contingent fee and the fee for Case No. 22354 but awarded P10,000.00 for Case No. 22031. Both parties appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N plaintiffs are entitled to the 10% contingent fee based on the value of the property adjudicated to the defendant.
2. W/N plaintiffs are entitled to attorney's fees for Civil Case No. 22031.
3. W/N plaintiffs are entitled to attorney's fees based on *quantum meruit* for Civil Case No. 22354.

IV. RULING
1. **NO** (Modified). The Court held that the contract provision claiming "10% of whatever amount... adjudicated" was ambiguous. Since the contract was prepared by the plaintiffs, the ambiguity must be resolved against them and in favor of the client, pursuant to Article 1377 of the New Civil Code. However, the Court recognized that plaintiffs' services contributed to the ultimate result, even if they did not directly participate in the final settlement. Considering they were not entirely successful in all incidents, a full 10% fee was deemed unfair. Instead, the Court ruled they were entitled to 5% of the amount the defendant received *in excess* of the share received by a co-heir of the same category. The Court calculated this excess to be P498,280.00, resulting in a fee of P24,914.00 [1-3].

2. **NO**. The contract expressly provided for free services in cases where "no material benefit redounds to your favor." While the lower court initially awarded fees in Civil Case No. 22031, the case was dismissed on appeal due to the amicable settlement. Consequently, this incident fell under the free services clause as it was not prosecuted to a final conclusion yielding a separate benefit [4].

3. **NO**. The claim for *quantum meruit* was denied because Civil Case No. 22354 was dismissed due to the plaintiffs' failure to appear at the hearing. Even assuming the negligence was excusable, the dismissal resulting from their non-appearance negates their right to compensation for that specific case [5].

**Disposition**: Decision modified. The award of P10,000.00 is reversed. Defendant is ordered to pay plaintiffs the sum of P24,914.00 as attorney's fees.
