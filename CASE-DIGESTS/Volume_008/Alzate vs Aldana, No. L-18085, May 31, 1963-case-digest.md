I. CAPTION
ANACLETO B. ALZATE v. BENIGNO ALDANA and ZACARIAS G. DE VERA, G.R. No. L-18085, May 31, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alzate, a high school principal, sought salary adjustments under Republic Act No. 842 (Public School Salary Act of 1953) as funded by R.A. No. 2042 [1, 2]. He claimed entitlement to five automatic salary rate increases: four for his 24 years of service and one for passing the Superintendent of Private Schools civil service examination [3]. Respondents (Director of Public Schools and Division Superintendent) granted a partial increase but denied the full request [3, 4]. Alzate filed a petition for mandamus. The lower court ruled he was entitled to the four rates for service but denied mandamus regarding the additional rate for the examination eligibility, finding no imperative duty on the respondents to recommend it [5]. Alzate appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N mandamus lies to compel respondents to recommend the additional salary increase for petitioner's civil service eligibility.

IV. RULING
**NO.** Mandamus allows for the enforcement of duties that are clearly and peremptorily enjoined by law; it does not issue in doubtful cases or where the respondent lacks the power to perform the act [7]. The Court found that the Cabinet authorized the release of funds under R.A. No. 2042 subject to the specific condition that salary adjustments be "limited to 4 rates," preventing respondents from recommending more without violating the directive [8]. Furthermore, Section 7(4) of Commonwealth Act No. 246 requires that expenditures from lump-sum appropriations be made in accordance with a budget approved by the President [9]. There is no specific provision enjoining respondents to adjust salaries independently, and the Director's general power to fix salaries under Section 190(c) of the Revised Administrative Code cannot prevail over the specific provisions of C.A. No. 246 [10, 11]. Thus, respondents had no clear legal duty to perform the act sought. The decision is affirmed [11].
