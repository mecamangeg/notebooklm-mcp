I. CAPTION
ELIZALDE ROPE FACTORY, INC. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, GERSON KARASIG and ROPE WORKERS UNION (PAFLU), G.R. No. L-16419, May 30, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On August 22, 1958, Gerson Karasig, a machine operator for Elizalde Rope Factory, Inc. (Petitioner), was ordered by his foreman to transfer to a spinning machine due to a lack of personnel [1]. Karasig refused multiple times, stating he would rather go home, and subsequently wrote "I stop at 9:10" on his time card before leaving the factory [1]. He later attempted to apply for retirement, citing unfair treatment by the foreman, but the management treated his actions as a resignation and denied the retirement application [1, 2].

The Rope Workers Union (Respondents) sent letters to management seeking to adjust the grievance [2]. Petitioner refused to confer, arguing that Karasig had resigned and that the Union failed to follow the specific grievance procedure outlined in their Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) [2]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled that while Karasig was not dismissed for union activities, Petitioner committed an unfair labor practice (ULP) by refusing to bargain regarding the grievance, and ordered Karasig's reinstatement [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Petitioner committed unfair labor practice by refusing to bargain over the grievance.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the duty to bargain collectively generally includes the obligation to meet and confer to adjust grievances, but it does not compel any party to agree to a proposal or make concessions [5, 6].

In this case, the CBA expressly provided a grievance procedure, which required the worker to discuss the dispute with the foreman and, if unsettled, file a written appeal within three days [7]. The Union failed to follow this prescribed procedure [8, 9]. Since the grievance handling procedure stipulated in the CBA is binding on both parties, the failure to observe it rendered the mechanism for adjusting grievances unavailable [8, 9]. Consequently, the Petitioner’s refusal to entertain the Union's letters—which were outside the agreed procedure—did not constitute a refusal to bargain or an unfair labor practice [10].

The judgment of the CIR is set aside and the charge of unfair labor practice is dismissed [11].
