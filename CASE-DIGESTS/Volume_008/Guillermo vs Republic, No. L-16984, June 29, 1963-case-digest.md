I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR REPATRIATION UNDER COMMONWEALTH ACT NO. 63. TRINIDAD GUILLERMO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16984, June 29, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Trinidad Guillermo filed a petition for repatriation with the Court of First Instance of Baguio City, alleging that she was a former Filipino citizen who lost her citizenship by marrying a Chinese national. Following her husband's death, she sought to reacquire her Philippine citizenship. She alleged in her petition that she had five minor children. However, during the hearing, the only evidence presented established her marriage, her husband's death, and her parents' citizenship. She testified merely that she was "living with her children," without providing proof of their names, dates of birth, or ages. The trial court granted the petition and further ruled that her repatriation would automatically confer Filipino citizenship upon her "minor children." The Solicitor General appealed, arguing the court erred in making factual findings about the children without evidence and in ruling on their citizenship status.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court had the authority to declare that the petitioner’s repatriation conferred Philippine citizenship upon her children.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction. The petitioner merely expressed a desire to reacquire her own Philippine citizenship and did not ask for a pronouncement regarding the citizenship of her children. The petition did not even contain the usual prayer "for such other relief as the court may deem meet and proper," preventing the court from granting relief not explicitly sought [1]. Furthermore, the Court found there was "absolutely no evidence" presented regarding the names, dates, or places of birth of the children [2]. Without proof of their minority, the lower court's pronouncement was devoid of factual basis and doubly erroneous. The finding of fact regarding the children and the conclusion of law regarding their citizenship were set aside [3].
