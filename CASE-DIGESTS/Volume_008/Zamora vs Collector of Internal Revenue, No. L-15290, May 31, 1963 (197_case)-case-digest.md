I. CAPTION
MARIANO ZAMORA v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE and COURT OF TAX APPEALS (and consolidated cases), G.R. Nos. L-15290, L-15280, L-15289 & L-15281, May 31, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Mariano Zamora, owner of the Bay View Hotel and Farmacia Zamora, filed income tax returns for 1951 and 1952. The Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed deficiency income taxes, disallowing certain deductions and finding undeclared capital gains from the sale of real properties acquired during the Japanese occupation.

Specifically, Zamora claimed P20,957.00 as promotion expenses for his wife’s trip abroad to purchase machinery and observe hotel management, but admitted she also sought medical treatment. He also claimed a 3.5% depreciation rate for the Bay View Hotel. Regarding capital gains, Zamora and his late sister sold a Manila property in 1951 (bought in May 1944) and a Quezon City property in 1951 (bought in Jan 1944). The CIR contested the cost basis, arguing the purchase prices were paid in Japanese war notes and should be adjusted.

On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) modified the CIR's decision. The CTA: (1) allowed only 50% of the promotion expenses (P10,478.50) due to lack of receipts and the dual purpose of the trip; (2) reduced the depreciation rate to 2.5% based on "Bulletin F" of the U.S. IRS; and (3) applied the Ballantyne Scale to the portion of the Manila property price paid in war notes but held the Quezon City property was paid in genuine Philippine currency. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N promotion expenses incurred during a combined business and medical trip, unsupported by receipts, are fully deductible.
2. W/N a 2.5% depreciation rate based on U.S. "Bulletin F" is correct for the hotel building.
3. W/N the Ballantyne Scale should be applied to determine the cost basis of properties acquired during the Japanese occupation for capital gains tax purposes.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court affirmed the CTA’s disallowance of 50% of the expenses. Under Section 30 of the Tax Code, business expenses must be ordinary, necessary, and substantiated by records showing details. Since Mrs. Zamora’s application for dollar allocation stated the trip was for "medical and business" purposes and no receipts were presented to segregate the costs, the Court held that allocating 50% to personal expenses was fair. Where the amount of representation expenses cannot be determined with exactitude due to lack of supporting papers, the court should determine the deductible amount from all available data [1], [2].

2. **YES.** The 2.5% rate was deemed reasonable. The CTA relied on "Bulletin F" (a U.S. Federal Internal Revenue Service publication), which estimates the useful life of concrete hotels at 40 years (2.5% rate). While not binding, Bulletin F has a "strong persuasive effect" as it results from scientific studies, and the Philippine Income Tax Law is patterned after U.S. law. The Court rejected Zamora’s reliance on a hotel management book, noting the author was an expert in management, not taxation [3], [4], [5].

3. **YES.** The cost basis of property acquired in Japanese war notes is the equivalent of the notes in genuine Philippine currency at the time of acquisition. For the Manila property, the Court upheld the CTA's factual finding that half the price was paid in Philippine currency and half in war notes; only the war note portion was subject to adjustment via the Ballantyne Scale. For the Quezon City property, the Court affirmed the finding that it was purchased entirely in genuine Philippine currency, as the price was close to the assessed value, making payment in depreciated war notes incredible. The petitions were dismissed and the decision affirmed [5], [6], [7], [8].
