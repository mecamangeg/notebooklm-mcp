I. CAPTION
TEOFILO TALAVERA v. VICTOR MAÑGOBA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18373, August 31, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On December 2, 1957, Teofilo Talavera filed a complaint for a sum of money against Victor Mañgoba and Nieves Safiru for unpaid poultry feeds [1]. During the hearing on March 10, 1958, neither the defendants nor their counsel appeared [2]. Consequently, the trial court received the plaintiff's evidence *ex parte* and rendered a decision on March 18, 1958, ordering Mañgoba to pay P2,425.73 while dismissing the case against Safiru [2, 3].

Mañgoba received the decision on March 25, 1958, and filed a Motion for New Trial the following day [3]. He argued that the failure to appear was due to excusable negligence as his counsel was ill with influenza, supported by a medical certificate and an affidavit of merit claiming valid defenses of payment [3]. He set the hearing for the motion on April 2, 1958, but the trial court denied it on April 1, 1958, one day before the scheduled hearing [3]. Mañgoba appealed, claiming he was deprived of his day in court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in denying the Motion for New Trial.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court should have granted the motion to give the appellant a chance to present his evidence [4, 5]. While courts generally have the discretion to grant or deny motions for new trial, the denial here was improper because the counsel's absence was explained by illness (supported by a medical certificate), and the motion was filed immediately with an affidavit of merit alleging that payments had already been made to the plaintiff [4].

The Court emphasized that the dispensation of justice and the vindication of legitimate grievances should not be barred by technicalities, citing *Ronquillo v. Marasigan* and *Santiago v. Joaquin* [6]. By resolving the motion one day before the set hearing date, the lower court deprived the appellant of the opportunity to present documents proving his claim [6].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is set aside, and the case is remanded to the court of origin for the reception of appellant's evidence and rendition of the corresponding decision [7].
