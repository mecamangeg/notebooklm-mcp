I. CAPTION
PATRICIO SALAMANCA v. ATTY. FELICIANO R. BAUTISTA, Adm. Case No. 204, July 31, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Patricio Salamanca hired respondent Atty. Feliciano Bautista to recover Php 3,000.00 from Juan Torres regarding the sale of a sugar mill. Bautista filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 1246) in the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija. Subsequently, Torres and his son-in-law approached Salamanca for an extrajudicial settlement and they proceeded to Bautista’s house. There, Bautista typed a document in Tagalog, which Salamanca signed after receiving Php 200.00 from Torres.

Salamanca later filed a disbarment case against Bautista, alleging malpractice. He claimed Bautista fraudulently induced him to sign the compromise agreement to his prejudice, arguing he did not understand the Tagalog contents as he is Ilocano, and that he received only Php 200.00 instead of the full claim. The Solicitor General initially recommended disciplinary action, but Bautista submitted additional evidence proving Salamanca’s knowledge of the transaction.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Atty. Bautista is guilty of malpractice for deceitfully inducing his client to sign the compromise agreement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court dismissed the complaint, finding no evidence of deception. The Court ruled that a lawyer cannot be held guilty of malpractice where circumstances show the client knew the contents of the document he signed.

First, regarding the language barrier, the Court noted that Tagalog is generally understood in San Jose, Nueva Ecija. Furthermore, the previous contract Salamanca signed engaging Bautista's services was also in Tagalog, yet he never claimed deceit regarding that document.

Second, Salamanca knew the money he received came from his adversary to "settle the case amicably." The agreement actually stipulated that the mill would be sold and the proceeds given to Salamanca, not just the Php 200.00 he received initially.

Third, Salamanca's conduct belied his claim of fraud: (a) he made no effort to have the document translated for several months despite having a relative studying law; (b) he delayed seventeen months before objecting to the agreement; and (c) he failed to prosecute his civil action against Torres for seven years after the lower court suspended proceedings pending the malpractice issue.

Finally, there was no proof of connivance. Had Bautista intended to deceive, he would have immediately withdrawn the civil complaint to prevent Salamanca from repudiating the agreement, which he did not do.

The complaint for malpractice is **DISMISSED**.
