I. CAPTION
SAURA IMPORT & EXPORT CO., INC. v. PHILIPPINE INTERNATIONAL SURETY CO., INC. and PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, G.R. No. L-15184, May 31, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Saura Import & Export Co., Inc. (Saura) mortgaged a parcel of land to respondent Philippine National Bank (PNB). As required by the mortgage, Saura insured the building and contents with respondent Philippine International Surety Co., Inc. (Insurer) for P29,000.00, endorsing the policy to PNB. The policy was effective for one year starting October 2, 1954. On October 15, 1954, the Insurer cancelled the policy and sent written notice to PNB (the mortgagee), which received it on November 8, 1954. However, no notice was sent to Saura (the insured). On April 6, 1955, the property was destroyed by fire. Saura filed a claim, which was denied because the policy had been cancelled. Saura sued the Insurer and PNB. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint. Saura appealed, primarily assigning errors against PNB, but seeking reversal of the dismissal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the cancellation of the insurance policy was valid and binding on the insured despite the lack of notice to them.
2. W/N the Supreme Court can review the Insurer's liability even if Saura did not specifically assign errors against the Insurer in the appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The cancellation was ineffective. The Court ruled that actual personal notice to the insured is essential to cancellation under a provision for cancellation by notice. Since the Insurance Law (Act No. 2427) and the policy were silent regarding the form and period of notice, the Court applied generally accepted insurance principles: notice must be clear, unequivocal, and personally given to the insured to afford them an opportunity to obtain other insurance. Notice given to the mortgagee alone is ineffective as a cancellation of the policy as to the owner of the property (citing *Connecticut Ins. Co. v. Caummisar*).

2. **YES.** The Supreme Court has the authority to review matters even if they are not assigned as errors in the appeal if their consideration is necessary in arriving at a just decision (citing *Hernandez v. Andal*). Although the assigned errors were directed against the bank, the appeal sought to reverse the lower court's dismissal, and the record showed liability attached principally to the Insurer for failing to notify Saura.

The Decision appealed from is REVERSED, and Philippine International Surety Co., Inc. is ordered to pay Saura Import & Export Co., Inc. the sum of P29,000.00.
