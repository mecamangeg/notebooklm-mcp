I. CAPTION
ANTONIO M. SAMIA v. ROMAN REYES, MARIANO DE GULA, TITO ALDANA, MARIANO MANUEL, and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-14760, May 31, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On May 15, 1956, petitioner Antonio M. Samia filed unlawful detainer cases against respondents (tenants) in the Municipal Court of Manila. Respondents moved to suspend proceedings invoking Republic Act No. 1599, claiming the property was a landed estate subject to expropriation. The Municipal Court initially suspended proceedings on the condition that respondents pay current rentals. However, respondents failed to pay current rentals and liquidate arrears despite court orders. Consequently, the Municipal Court rendered judgment ordering respondents to vacate and pay rentals.

Respondents appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila but failed to file supersedeas bonds or deposit current rentals during the appeal. Thus, the CFI issued writs of execution and demolition. Respondents then filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with the Court of Appeals (CA), alleging the property was a landed estate involved in pending expropriation proceedings. The CA granted the writ and suspended the ejectment and demolition. Samia appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the ejectment proceedings should be suspended under Republic Act Nos. 1162 and 1599 due to pending expropriation.
2. W/N the immediate execution of the ejectment judgment was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 5 of Republic Act No. 1162, as amended by Republic Act No. 1599, tenants of landed estates must perform at least two positive acts to avail of the suspension of ejectment proceedings: (1) pay current rentals, and (2) liquidate rentals in arrears within eighteen months. The Court held that payment of current rentals is a condition precedent (*sine qua non*) for suspension. The laws never contemplated a situation where tenants could suspend proceedings without paying rentals, as it would be injurious for the State to expropriate property while depriving the owner of income. Since respondents failed to pay current rentals and liquidate arrears, they were not entitled to suspension. (Citing *Prieto v. Macadaeg*, *Sison v. Bayona*).

2. **YES.** Under Section 8, Rule 72 of the Rules of Court, immediate execution of a judgment in favor of the plaintiff in ejectment cases is authorized. The only exceptions are if the defendant (1) perfects an appeal and files a supersedeas bond, and (2) pays the plaintiff or deposits in court the current rentals during the pendency of the appeal. Respondents failed to fulfill these requisites; thus, the CFI had no alternative but to issue the writs of execution. (Citing *Pascua v. Nable*, *Yu Tiong Tay v. Barrios*).

Petition is **GRANTED**. The decision of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED**, and the orders and writs of execution issued by the CFI of Manila are sustained.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
