I. CAPTION
C. N. HODGES and RICARDO GURREA, in their own behalf as majority stockholders and for and in behalf of the La Paz Ice Plant & Cold Storage Co., Inc. v. JOSE MANUEL LEZAMA and PAQUITA B. LEZAMA, G.R. No. L-17327, August 30, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs C.N. Hodges and Ricardo Gurrea, majority stockholders of La Paz Ice Plant & Cold Storage Co., Inc., filed a complaint against defendants Jose Manuel Lezama (President-Manager) and Paquita B. Lezama (Secretary) for mismanagement and failure to call stockholders' meetings [1, 2]. The trial court placed the corporation under receivership on September 26, 1958 [3]. Subsequently, plaintiff Gurrea sold seven shares of stock to Ricardo Jeruta, Jr., Felipe Espinosa, and Isidro Perlado [4]. Despite surrendering the certificates to Paquita Lezama for registration, she refused to record the transfer in the corporate books [4]. Upon motion by the buyers, the trial court ordered Paquita to register the transfer [5]. She appealed, arguing that since the corporation was under receivership, the receiver should determine the matter, and that the buyers were not parties to the pending case [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court has jurisdiction to order the corporate secretary to register the transfer of shares while the corporation is under receivership.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that a trial court has jurisdiction to order a receiver of a corporation under receivership to do any act to protect and preserve its properties [6]. To that end, the court may also order the secretary of the corporation to perform acts within the internal affairs of the corporation aimed at protecting the interests of the stockholders, citing *Angeles v. Santos* [6]. The Court further held that Sections 35 and 52 of the Corporation Law require all transfers to be entered in corporate books to be valid and contemplate no restriction as to whom shares may be transferred, pursuant to *Fleischer v. Botica Nolasco Co., Inc.* [6]. With the assets under receivership, the trial court was duty-bound and authorized to require the secretary to perform her duties under the law [6]. The order appealed from is affirmed [7].
