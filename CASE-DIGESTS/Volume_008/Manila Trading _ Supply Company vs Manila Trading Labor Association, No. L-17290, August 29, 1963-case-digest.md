**I. CAPTION**
**MANILA TRADING AND SUPPLY COMPANY v. MANILA TRADING LABOR ASSOCIATION AND COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS**, G.R. No. L-17290, August 29, 1963, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
On July 23, 1946, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) rendered a decision in Case No. 12-V granting the Manila Trading Labor Association's (Union) demand for 100% additional pay for services rendered on Sundays and holidays [1, 2]. This decision became final and executory [3]. The Union alleged that Manila Trading and Supply Company (Company) failed to pay this additional compensation from 1946 to 1952 and paid only 25% from 1952 to 1955 [2, 4].

On December 13, 1958, more than twelve years after the original award, the Union filed a petition with the CIR to recover the unpaid compensation based on the 1946 decision [1, 3]. The Company moved to dismiss, arguing the claim had prescribed and could not be filed as a mere incident to the closed case [5]. The CIR denied the motion, holding that the prescriptive period was ten years under Article 1144 of the Civil Code and subsequently ordered the Company to pay the differential [5, 6]. The Company appealed [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the 1946 CIR award may be enforced by a mere motion/petition filed in 1958.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petition for enforcement was effectively a motion for execution [3]. Under Section 23 of Commonwealth Act No. 103, as amended, the enforcement of CIR awards is governed by the Rules of Court applicable to Courts of First Instance [3]. Specifically, **Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court** provides that a final judgment may be executed by mere motion only within five years from the date of its entry [3, 7].

Applying *National Development Co. v. Aralor*, the Court ruled that since the award was made in 1946 and the petition for enforcement was filed only in 1958—long after the five-year period expired—it could no longer be enforced by a mere motion [3, 7].

The decision appealed from is **SET ASIDE**, without prejudice to the claimants' right to enforce the award of July 23, 1946, in the manner provided by law [8].
