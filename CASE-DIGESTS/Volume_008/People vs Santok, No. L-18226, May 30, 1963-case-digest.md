I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FLORENCIO SANTOK, G.R. No. L-18226, May 30, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant Florencio Santok was charged with the murder of Amando Fabul, a barrio lieutenant. Prosecution witnesses Jose Trillanes and Simplicia Fabul positively identified Santok as the person who fired at the deceased [1]. The victim’s widow, Quirina Canuel, testified that her husband, in an *ante-mortem* statement immediately after the shooting, identified Santok as his assailant [1, 2]. The defense interposed an alibi, claiming Santok was 22 kilometers away, and presented medical opinions suggesting the victim could not have spoken due to his injuries [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance of Batangas convicted Santok of murder, relying on an alleged admission by Santok that the crime was instigated by a third party to establish evident premeditation [5, 6]. Santok appealed the conviction.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused's alibi prevails over the positive identification and physical evidence.
2. W/N the killing is qualified by evident premeditation to constitute murder.
3. W/N the crime is aggravated by contempt of public authority.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the alibi is without factual foundation. It was refuted by the defendant's own prior affidavit stating he was in his house at the time of the incident (contradicting his trial testimony), and by the positive identification by eyewitnesses [3, 7]. Furthermore, expert testimony from the NBI established that given the location of the wound, the victim could have retained consciousness and the power of speech to identify his assailant [4].

2. **NO.** The Court held that evident premeditation cannot qualify the killing to murder because the presence of the deceased at the scene of the crime could not have been anticipated by the defendant [8, 9]. Without proof that the specific encounter was planned, the element of evident premeditation is lacking. Consequently, Santok is guilty merely of the crime of **Homicide**, not Murder [9].

3. **YES.** The Court affirmed that the commission of the crime was attended by the aggravating circumstance of contempt of public authority [10]. This is because the deceased, Amando Fabul, was a barrio lieutenant who was killed while in the performance of his official duties [9, 10].

**Disposition:** The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**, as the penalty imposed by the lower court falls within the maximum range of the penalty imposable for Homicide attended by an aggravating circumstance [9].
