**I. CAPTION**
LUZON STEVEDORING CO., INC., SANTA MESA SLIPWAY AND ENGINEERING CO., and PATRICK J. MACFADDEN v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, BROTHERHOOD OF SHIPBUILDERS, MARINE and MAINTENANCE WORKERS (FFW) and/or ISABELO DESPABILADERAS, G.R. No. L-16682, July 26, 1963, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
Isabelo Despabiladeras, an employee of petitioner Luzon Stevedoring Co., Inc., was dismissed after leaving work to secure a residence certificate [1, 2]. He filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP). On November 28, 1959, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), through Judge Bautista, rendered a decision finding petitioners guilty of ULP and ordering the employee's reinstatement [3].

On December 8, 1959, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration, reserving the right to submit supporting arguments within the 10-day period provided by CIR rules [4]. On December 10, petitioners moved for a 10-day extension to file said arguments due to counsel’s illness [4]. The CIR denied the extension on December 18, citing its "no extension" policy [5]. Petitioners filed their arguments on December 23, but the CIR *en banc* denied the Motion for Reconsideration on January 27, 1960, because the supporting arguments were filed out of time [5, 6]. Petitioners appealed, arguing the denial of the extension was an abuse of discretion and that their Motion for Reconsideration was sufficient even without the arguments [7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the CIR abused its discretion in denying the motion for extension of time to file supporting arguments.
2. W/N the petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration was *pro forma* and thus properly dismissed.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court of Industrial Relations is vested with the power to adopt its own rules of procedure under Section 20 of Commonwealth Act No. 103 [8, 9]. The CIR's standing "no extension" policy regarding the 10-day period for filing supporting arguments is a valid exercise of this power and is not arbitrary [9]. This policy is consistent with the principle that failure to observe periods for filing motions and supporting arguments is sufficient cause for dismissal (*Bien, et al. v. Castillo, et al.*) [10].

2. **YES.** A Motion for Reconsideration is *pro forma* if it merely states that a decision is contrary to law or facts without explaining *why* [11]. Although petitioners' motion specified errors in the decision, it failed to substantiate those claims with arguments, which is precisely why they reserved the right to file a separate memorandum [11]. Citing *Pandes v. Hon. Teodoro*, the Court held that a motion must point out why the findings are not justified by the evidence [12]. Since the supporting arguments were filed late and rejected, the motion stood alone as a *pro forma* motion, which did not suspend the running of the period for appeal [13]. Consequently, the decision of the trial judge became final and unappealable, as only decisions of the CIR *en banc* may be appealed to the Supreme Court [13].

The decision and resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations are affirmed [14].
