I. CAPTION
EMMA S. ACENAS and ALBERTO E. ACENAS v. ANGELA SISON and TEOFILO SISON, G.R. No. L-17011, August 30, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Angela Sison executed a promissory note in favor of Emma Acenas for P8,160.00 but failed to pay the balance [1]. Spouses Acenas sued Angela and joined her husband, Teofilo Sison, as a defendant pursuant to Article 113 of the Civil Code [1]. Teofilo denied liability, asserting he did not sign the note [2]. During the hearing, the defendants' counsel, Atty. Nicanor S. Sison, initially moved for postponement to confer with his clients for a settlement [2, 3]. However, upon the trial court's suggestion, the counsel agreed to a confession of judgment against his clients, provided the writ of execution would be suspended until June 30, 1960 [2, 3]. The trial court rendered judgment ordering the Sisons to pay the debt jointly and severally [4]. Teofilo appealed, arguing his lawyer lacked authority to confess judgment and that he should not be solidarily liable for his wife's debt [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the counsel had the authority to confess judgment on behalf of the client Teofilo Sison.
2. W/N the husband is solidarily liable for his wife's promissory note solely because he was joined as a defendant.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Attorneys require special authority to compromise their client's litigation or receive anything in discharge of a claim, as per Section 21 of Rule 127 of the Rules of Court [5, 6]. The Court held that compromise of causes and confession of judgments stand on the same footing [5, 6]. The record showed the counsel moved for postponement specifically to "confer" with his clients, which logically indicated he lacked the authority to confess judgment at that time [3, 7]. Therefore, the trial court erred in accepting the confession without ascertaining the counsel's authority [8].

2. **NO.** The law requires the joinder of the husband not to bind him personally with his wife, but because he is the administrator of the conjugal partnership [9, 10]. Making the husband solidarily liable simply due to this joinder would subvert the rule under Article 172 of the Civil Code that the wife cannot bind the conjugal partnership without the husband's consent [9, 10]. No exceptions to this rule (e.g., expenses for daily family needs) were alleged in this case [10].

The decision was modified; Teofilo Sison is absolved of liability, and Angela Sison is held solely liable [11].
