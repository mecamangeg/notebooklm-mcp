I. CAPTION
NEGROS NAVIGATION CO., INC. v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18629, May 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Negros Navigation Co., Inc. stored old marine engines at the Iloilo wharf. The Collector of Customs of Iloilo assessed storage charges of P19,601.82 against Petitioner [1]. Petitioner requested reconsideration. The Collector sought an opinion from the Respondent Commissioner of Customs, who stated in an indorsement that the engines were subject to charges [2]. Relying on this opinion, the Collector demanded payment. Petitioner requested reconsideration again, but the Collector, citing the Commissioner's unchanged view, issued a peremptory period for payment on November 28, 1960 [2].

Instead of protesting or appealing the Collector's decision to the Commissioner, Petitioner filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [1, 3]. The Commissioner moved to dismiss, arguing the CTA lacked jurisdiction because Petitioner failed to appeal the Collector's ruling to the Commissioner within the reglementary period, meaning there was no "decision" of the Commissioner to review [4]. The CTA dismissed the petition [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an opinion or concurrence of the Commissioner of Customs on a matter referred by a Collector constitutes a "decision" appealable to the Court of Tax Appeals.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's dismissal. The Court held that the Commissioner's action on matters referred by a Collector for advice is merely supervisory in nature. His conformity or disagreement with the Collector's views does not transform the Collector's ruling into a decision of the Commissioner [5, 6].

Citing *Sampaguita Shoe & Slipper Factory v. Commissioner*, the Court ruled that an aggrieved party must strictly follow the two-phase appeal process: (1) Appeal the adverse ruling of the Collector to the Commissioner within 15 days pursuant to Section 1380 of the Revised Administrative Code; and (2) If legally unsatisfied with the Commissioner's decision on that appeal, file a petition with the CTA within 30 days pursuant to Section 7 of R.A. No. 1125 [6, 7]. Since Petitioner failed to appeal the Collector's assessment to the Commissioner, there was no decision reviewable by the CTA [6].

The Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [8].
