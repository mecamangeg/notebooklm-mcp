I. CAPTION
ELIZALDE ROPE FACTORY, INC. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, GERSON KARASIG and ROPE WORKERS UNION (PAFLU), G.R. No. L-16419, May 30, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On August 22, 1958, respondent Gerson Karasig, a machine operator at petitioner's factory, refused his foreman's order to transfer to a spinning machine to cover for a sick co-worker. Karasig instead clocked out, writing "I stop at 9:10" on his time card, and later filled out a retirement form claiming unfair labor practice and inhuman treatment by the foreman. The respondent Union sent letters to the petitioner regarding Karasig's case, but the petitioner did not reply.

Respondents filed a complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP). The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled that while Karasig was not dismissed for union activities, the petitioner committed ULP by refusing to bargain collectively, specifically for failing to answer the Union's letters. The CIR ordered Karasig's reinstatement. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the parties failed to follow the grievance procedure stipulated in their Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner committed an unfair labor practice by refusing to bargain collectively when it failed to reply to the Union's letters regarding the employee's grievance.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the petitioner did not commit an unfair labor practice. Under Section 13 of Republic Act No. 875, the duty to bargain collectively includes the mutual obligation to meet and confer for the purpose of adjusting grievances. However, this duty is subject to the terms of the parties' agreement.

In this case, the CBA explicitly provided for a specific grievance procedure: (1) discussion with the foreman, (2) written appeal to the Assistant Superintendent, and (3) appeal to the Superintendent/Manager by the Union Grievance Board. These procedures are binding on both parties. Since the respondents failed to follow the prescribed grievance procedure, the mechanism for adjusting grievances under the collective bargaining agreement was unavailable, and they could not invoke the statutory duty to bargain on this specific matter.

The judgment of the Court of Industrial Relations is **SET ASIDE** and the charge of unfair labor practice is **DISMISSED**.
