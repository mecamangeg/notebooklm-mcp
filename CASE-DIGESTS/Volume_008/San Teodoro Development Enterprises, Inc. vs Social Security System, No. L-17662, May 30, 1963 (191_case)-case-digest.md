I. CAPTION
SAN TEODORO DEVELOPMENT ENTERPRISES, INC. v. SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-17662, May 30, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Chua Lam & Company, Ltd. was a limited partnership registered in 1951 doing business as "San Teodoro Sawmill." On January 2, 1957, San Teodoro Sawmill Co., Inc. (later renamed San Teodoro Development Enterprises, Inc.) was incorporated. Shortly thereafter, the partnership was dissolved, and its assets were sold to the new corporation. The Social Security System (SSS) notified the corporation that it fell under compulsory coverage effective September 1, 1957. The corporation objected, claiming exemption under Section 9 of the Social Security Act (Republic Act No. 1161), which exempted entities in operation for less than two years. It argued it was a distinct legal personality organized only in January 1957. The Social Security Commission denied the exemption, finding that the corporation was merely a continuation of the partnership, noting that four out of five partners were incorporators and directors, the trade name remained the same, and the employees were identical.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner corporation is exempt from compulsory SSS coverage on the ground that it has been in operation for less than two years.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the SSS Commission's resolution. While a corporation generally has a juridical personality separate from its members, this fiction will be disregarded when used to defeat public convenience or evade statutory obligations. The Court found that the dissolution of the partnership and the creation of the corporation were effected in a sequence ensuring the smooth transfer of business without interruption. The controlling interest, management, employees, and trade name remained substantially the same.

Citing *Laguna Transportation Co., Inc. v. Social Security System*, the Court held that the substance of the juridical person owning and operating the business remained the same despite the change in legal personality. To grant the exemption would allow employers to circumvent the statute by simply changing their form of organization every two years, which would defeat the purpose of the Social Security Act. Thus, the prior period of operation by the partnership was credited to the corporation.

The resolution of the Social Security Commission is **AFFIRMED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS (if any)
None.
