I. CAPTION
MELANIO OLANO v. DOMINADOR RONQUILLO, FERMIN PORTILES, and the HON. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, G.R. No. L-17912, May 31, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
San Isidro, Samar was reclassified as a 7th class municipality effective July 1, 1958, and was entitled to elect six councilors under Republic Act No. 2368. However, during the November 10, 1959 elections, the Municipal Board of Canvassers (MBC), believing the municipality was still entitled to only four councilors, proclaimed only the top four candidates. The Commission on Elections (COMELEC), finding that the official ballots contained six spaces and political parties had fielded six candidates each, ordered the MBC to reconvene and proclaim the 5th and 6th councilors. Petitioner Melanio Olano challenged this order, arguing that the electorate was misled and voted for only four councilors. The COMELEC denied his motion, prompting this petition for review.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the COMELEC has the power to order the Municipal Board of Canvassers to reconvene and proclaim the 5th and 6th councilors after the Board had already issued a proclamation for the first four.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that while the Commission on Elections is an administrative body, it has the power to ensure that officers performing administrative functions connected with elections comply with their duties.

The duty of the MBC to proclaim the six candidates who received the highest number of votes was ministerial. By proclaiming only four, the MBC failed to perform this duty. Although a board of canvassers is generally deemed *functus officio* after making a proclamation (*Bautista vs. Fugoso*), this rule does not apply when the board fails to include all returns or candidates required by law. Citing *Abendante vs. Relato*, the Court held that just as the COMELEC can order a board to reconvene to include a wrongfully excluded election return, it can also compel the board to reconvene to complete the proclamation of the remaining councilors entitled to office.

The petition was dismissed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred. Justices Labrador and Barrera took no part.
