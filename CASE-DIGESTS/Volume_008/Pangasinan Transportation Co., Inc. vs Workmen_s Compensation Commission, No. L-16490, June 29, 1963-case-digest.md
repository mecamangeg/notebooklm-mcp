I. CAPTION
PANGASINAN TRANSPORTATION CO., INC. v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and CECILIO GATDULA, G.R. No. L-16490, June 29, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Cecilio Gatdula worked as a bus driver for petitioner Pangasinan Transportation Co., Inc. since 1950. His work involved driving 8 to 12 hours daily on rough, dusty routes and physically lifting passenger baggage [1, 2]. In 1953, he suffered injuries from an accident but returned to work in 1954. By early 1955, he was diagnosed with acute bronchitis, which developed into pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), causing the company to stop his employment [3]. Gatdula filed his notice of sickness and claim for compensation only on September 2, 1957, more than two years after his disability began [4]. The Hearing Officer ordered petitioner to pay compensation, which the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed [1, 5]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the claim was barred by the failure to file within the 60-day period prescribed by Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, that the Hearing Officer lacked jurisdiction, and that the illness was not work-connected [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claim for compensation is barred by the delay in filing the notice of sickness.
2. W/N the Hearing Officer of the Regional Office had jurisdiction to hear the case.
3. W/N the respondent's illness (PTB) is compensable.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The delay is excused under Section 27 of the Workmen's Compensation Act because the petitioner had actual knowledge of the sickness. The Court found that the employer knew of Gatdula's bronchitis, which developed into PTB, and actually laid him off due to this affliction [6, 7]. Section 27 provides that failure to give notice is not a bar if the employer had knowledge of the accident or did not suffer by such delay [7].

2. **YES.** The Regional Offices and their Hearing Officers have jurisdiction to hear workmen's compensation claims. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *La Mallorca and Pampanga Bus Company v. Ramos* (G.R. No. L-15476), holding that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A validly conferred jurisdiction upon Regional Offices to hear claims falling under the Workmen's Compensation Law, as this power was not revoked by Republic Act No. 992 or other statutes [7, 8].

3. **YES.** The illness is compensable as the working conditions aggravated the disease. The Court upheld the WCC's finding that the rough, dusty routes and physical exertion were precipitating factors for the aggravation of his pre-existing PTB [2]. Furthermore, under the doctrine in *Naira v. Workmen's Compensation Commission* (G.R. No. L-18066), there is a statutory presumption that an injury or death supervening in the course of employment is compensable. The burden is on the employer to prove it was *not* work-connected, which the petitioner failed to do [9].

**WHEREFORE, the decision under review is AFFIRMED.**
