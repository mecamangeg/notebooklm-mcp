I. CAPTION
LUZON STEVEDORING CO., INC., SANTA MESA SLIPWAY AND ENGINEERING CO., and PATRICK J. MACFADDEN v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, BROTHERHOOD OF SHIPBUILDERS, MARINE and MAINTENANCE WORKERS (FFW) and/or ISABELO DESPABILADERAS, G.R. No. L-16682, July 26, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Isabelo Despabiladeras, a pump operator for petitioners, was dismissed after leaving work for two hours on January 17, 1958, to secure a residence certificate upon instruction by the company timekeeper. He filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), through Judge Bautista, ruled in his favor on November 28, 1959, ordering reinstatement with back wages.

Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) on December 8, 1959, reserving the right to file supporting arguments within the 10-day reglementary period ending December 18. On December 10, petitioners moved for a 10-day extension to file arguments due to counsel's illness. The CIR denied the extension on December 18 based on its "no extension" policy. Petitioners filed their arguments on December 23, but the CIR *en banc* denied the MR on January 27, 1960, because the arguments were filed out of time. Petitioners appealed, arguing the denial of extension was an abuse of discretion and that their initial MR was sufficient on its own.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR abused its discretion in denying the motion for extension of time to file supporting arguments.
2. W/N the Motion for Reconsideration filed on December 8, 1959, was *pro forma* and thus validly dismissed.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The CIR is vested with the power to adopt its own rules under Section 20 of Commonwealth Act No. 103 [1]. The Court held that the CIR's "no extension" policy regarding the 10-day period for filing supporting arguments is not arbitrary or an abuse of discretion [1]. It aligns with procedural rules ensuring the speedy disposition of cases.

2. **YES.** The initial motion merely alleged that the decision was "contrary to law" and "contrary to the facts" without explaining *why* the findings were erroneous [2]. It is not enough to state what part of the decision is wrong; the motion must explain why [2]. Citing *Pandes v. Teodoro*, the Court ruled that a motion failing to point out why the evidence does not justify the findings is *pro forma* [3]. Since the supporting arguments were filed late and the motion itself was *pro forma*, it did not toll the running of the period to appeal. Consequently, the decision of the single judge became final and unappealable [4].

The decision and resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations are affirmed [5].
