I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CONRADO LADISLA, EULOGIO ENCARNACION, PEDRO BATALLA and PABLO BATALLA, G.R. No. L-18011, August 31, 1963, Paredes, J. [1-3]

II. FACTS
On April 27, 1960, the Assistant Fiscal of Nueva Ecija filed an Information charging Conrado Ladisla and his co-accused, tenants of Gonzalo I. Guevarra, with violation of Sec. 39, Rep. Act No. 1199 for pre-threshing harvest without notice between February 17 to 19, 1960 [3, 4]. On November 4, 1960, the accused were arraigned and pleaded "not guilty" [5]. On November 16, 1960, the Fiscal filed a motion to amend the Information to change the date of the offense from February 1960 to the "middle part of December, 1959," citing newly discovered evidence [5-7].

At the hearing on November 18, 1960, the defense objected to the amendment [8]. The trial court sustained the objection and denied the motion to amend [8]. The Fiscal subsequently submitted the case, prompting the court to dismiss the case *motu proprio* and cancel the accused's bail bonds [8]. The Fiscal moved for reconsideration, arguing the amendment was not substantial, but the defense opposed this on the ground of double jeopardy [9]. The trial court denied the motion, and the State appealed the Order of Dismissal to the Supreme Court [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal from the trial court's order of dismissal is barred by double jeopardy. [10, 11]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that double jeopardy had already set in [10, 11]. Under Rule 113, Sec. 9, legal jeopardy exists when a case is dismissed or otherwise terminated without the express consent of the accused, by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a valid complaint or information, and after the defendant has pleaded to the charge [10, 11]. Citing *People v. Ylagan* and *Mendoza v. Almeda Lopez*, the Court found all requisites present: the accused had pleaded to a valid information, and the dismissal was ordered *motu proprio* (without their express consent) after the Fiscal submitted the case [10, 11].

The Court emphasized that the State's appeal was directed against the order of dismissal, not merely the denial of the amendment [11, 12]. Whatever error the lower court might have committed in dismissing the case could not be corrected in disregard of the constitutional defense of double jeopardy [12, 13].

The Order appealed from is **AFFIRMED**. [14]
