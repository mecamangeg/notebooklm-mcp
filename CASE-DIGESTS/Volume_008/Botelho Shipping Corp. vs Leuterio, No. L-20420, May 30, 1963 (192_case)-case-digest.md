**I. CAPTION**
**BOTELHO SHIPPING CORPORATION v. THE HON. JOSE N. LEUTERIO, SENATOR FERDINAND MARCOS, REPRESENTATIVE RAMON BAGATSING and ABELARDO SUBIDO**, G.R. No. L-20420, May 30, 1963, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Botelho Shipping Corp. applied for ocean-going vessels under the Reparations Program. The Reparations Commission submitted a tentative schedule for the fifth reparations year to the President via the National Economic Council (NEC). The NEC recommended a reduced schedule, eliminating the vessels, based on verbal information that the Japanese Government would only approve a lower amount. However, the NEC noted that deferred projects could be included if a larger amount was arranged. The President subsequently approved a schedule restoring the vessels and increasing the total amount "after considering" the NEC's recommendations. The Reparations Commission finalized this schedule with Japan, and Petitioner was awarded a vessel and signed a purchase contract. Respondents Marcos, Bagatsing, and Subido filed a case in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to annul the "expanded" schedule, arguing it was void for lacking NEC recommendation. Respondent Judge Leuterio ruled in favor of respondents, declaring the schedule void insofar as it exceeded NEC recommendations and issuing a permanent injunction against Petitioner. Petitioner filed for certiorari.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the recommendation of the National Economic Council regarding the reparations schedule is binding upon the President.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The recommendation of the National Economic Council (NEC) in the preparation of the reparations schedule under Republic Act No. 1789 is merely advisory. To "recommend" means to present advice or choice, implying that another has the final decision. The legislative history of R.A. 1789 confirms that the NEC acts as an advisory body to the President, who retains the power of final approval. The President's action merely forms the basis for consultation between the Philippine and Japanese Governments. Furthermore, the NEC's reduction of the schedule was conditional upon the limited amount Japan was expected to approve; since the Reparations Commission succeeded in securing a larger amount, the restoration of the petitioner’s vessel was consistent with the NEC's conditional recommendation. The lower court abused its discretion in annulling the President's act.

Petition granted. The judgment of the respondent court and the permanent injunction are set aside and annulled.
