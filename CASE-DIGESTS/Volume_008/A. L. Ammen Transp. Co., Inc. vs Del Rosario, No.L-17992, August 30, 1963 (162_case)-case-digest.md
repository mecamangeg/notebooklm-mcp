I. CAPTION
A. L. AMMEN TRANSPORTATION CO., INC., BICOL TRANSPORTATION CO., INC., and CONSOLIDATED AUTO LINES, INC. v. EMILIANO DEL ROSARIO, G.R. No. L-17992, August 30, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Emiliano Del Rosario applied with the Public Service Commission (PSC) for authority to operate four passenger trucks on the Tiwi-Naga City line and one truck on the Tiwi-Legaspi City line. Petitioners, existing transportation operators in the Bicol region, opposed the application on the ground that Del Rosario lacked the financial capacity to establish and maintain the service. To prove his capacity, Del Rosario claimed ownership of commercial land in Pasig valued at P14,000 and a house and lot in Makati valued at P20,000, in addition to his daily wage as a driver. However, petitioners presented tax rolls showing Del Rosario had no declared property in Pasig and that his Makati property was assessed at a much lower value. Despite this, the PSC approved the application on December 22, 1960, finding the respondent financially capable. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent is financially capable of establishing and maintaining the authorized public service.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the PSC decision and denied the application. While the law does not fix a specific amount necessary for establishing a bus line, leaving this to the discretion of the PSC, the Court found that the evidence of the respondent's financial condition rendered it impossible for him to run the service efficiently [1, 2].

The Court took **judicial notice** of the fact that trucks are expensive and require considerable capital not only for acquisition (bodies, tires) but also for ongoing operations (salaries for drivers and mechanics) to ensure passenger safety [2, 3]. Given the discrepancies in the respondent's alleged assets versus the tax records, he lacked the necessary funds. The Court further ruled that an alleged subsequent registration of trucks, without concrete evidence of ownership or condition, could not cure this lack of financial ability [4].

**Disposition:** Decision set aside; application denied.
