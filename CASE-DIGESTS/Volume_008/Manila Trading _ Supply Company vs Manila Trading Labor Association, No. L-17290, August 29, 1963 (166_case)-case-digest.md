I. CAPTION
MANILA TRADING AND SUPPLY COMPANY v. MANILA TRADING LABOR ASSOCIATION and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-17290, August 29, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On July 23, 1946, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) rendered a decision in Case No. 12-V awarding, among others, 100% additional pay for work performed on Sundays and holidays to the employees of Manila Trading and Supply Company [1, 2].

Years later, on December 13, 1958, the Manila Trading Labor Association (Union) filed a petition with the CIR on behalf of its members to recover unpaid additional compensation for services rendered from 1946 to 1955 [2]. The Union alleged that the Company failed to pay the differentials required by the 1946 adjudication [3]. The Company moved to dismiss, arguing that the claim had prescribed and could not be filed as a mere incident of the 1946 case [4]. The CIR denied the motion and ordered the Company to pay the additional compensation, ruling that the prescriptive period was ten years under the Civil Code [1, 4]. The Company appealed by certiorari [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the 1946 CIR award may be enforced by a mere motion for execution filed in 1958.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the petition for enforcement was correctly treated as a motion for execution, but it was filed too late [5].

Under Section 23 of Commonwealth Act No. 103, as amended, the enforcement of CIR awards constitutes a remedy governed by Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court [5]. This rule provides that a final judgment may be executed by mere motion only within five years from the date of its entry [5, 6]. After the lapse of five years, the judgment can only be enforced by an independent action [5].

Applying *National Development Co. v. Aralor*, the Court ruled that since the award was made in 1946 and the motion for execution was filed only in 1958—long past the five-year period—it could no longer be enforced by mere motion [5].

The decision appealed from is **SET ASIDE**, without prejudice to the claimants' right to enforce the award of July 23, 1946, in the manner provided by law [7].
