I. CAPTION
LEONCIO NGO alias GO LIONG SIU v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18319, May 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Leoncio Ngo filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Manila [1, 2]. He claimed an average annual income of P3,300.00 (approximately P300.00 per month) from 1956 to 1958, while supporting a wife and four children and paying a monthly house rental of P200.00 [3]. In his petition, he listed his residences as 927-B Oregon and 505 Magdalena, Manila; however, trial testimony revealed he had also resided at 528 T. Pinpin, Alvarado Extension, 927 Magdalena St., and in Mindoro [4]. To support his petition, he presented two character witnesses, Clarita Guarin and Makiling Buenaventura, who were employees in the company where Ngo held a high position and where his father was a stockholder [2, 5]. The trial court granted the petition, and the Republic appealed [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the failure to allege all former places of residence in the petition is fatal.
3. W/N the character witnesses are qualified and credible.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that a monthly income of P300.00 is not considered lucrative for a petitioner with a wife and four children, especially considering he pays P200.00 a month for rent [3]. Given the high cost of living, this financial capacity is insufficient [3].

2. **YES.** The failure to allege all former places of residence—specifically T. Pinpin, Alvarado Extension, 927 Magdalena, and Mindoro—is a violation of Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law [4]. This requirement is fatal because it provides the government with the necessary clue or basis to determine the petitioner's fitness and qualifications to become a Filipino citizen [4, 5].

3. **NO.** The witnesses did not possess the necessary independence of mind because they were subordinates in a company where the petitioner held a high position and his father owned stock [5, 7]. Furthermore, their acquaintance with the petitioner (e.g., meeting during manicure sessions or buying records) was merely superficial and casual, making them unfit to insure his conduct and behavior as required by law [7, 8].

Accordingly, the decision is reversed and the petition is dismissed [9].
