I. CAPTION
MARIA SANTIAGO, ET AL. v. JOSE RAMIREZ, ET AL. and DR. NICOLAS JOAQUIN, G.R. No. L-15237, May 31, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Andres Herrera, owner of a homestead with Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. H-151, died in 1937. In 1949, his heirs (plaintiffs-appellants) delivered the OCT to their relative, defendant Jose Ramirez, to find a buyer. Instead, Ramirez and Marcial del Rosario forged a deed of sale dated April 22, 1949, making it appear that the deceased Herrera sold the land to Marcos Agustin. A Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) was issued to Agustin, who subsequently sold the property to defendant-appellee Dr. Nicolas Joaquin. A new TCT was issued in Joaquin’s name in 1950.

Plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan to annul the sale and cancel Joaquin's title. Joaquin filed a Motion to Dismiss (MTD) and an Answer alleging good faith and prescription, but did not mention any prior case. Months later, Joaquin’s counsel discovered a previous dismissal of a similar case (Civil Case No. 471) involving the same property. Joaquin then filed an Amended Answer and a second MTD on the ground of *res judicata*. The CFI admitted the Amended Answer and dismissed the complaint, ruling that the prior dismissal was an adjudication on the merits.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the complaint on the ground of *res judicata* was proper.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the order of dismissal and remanded the case for further proceedings.

The Court held that the defense of *res judicata* was deemed waived. Under Section 10, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court, all defenses not interposed in a motion to dismiss or in an answer are deemed waived. Since the prior case (Civil Case No. 471) existed before Joaquin filed his first MTD and Answer, and he failed to raise it then, he was barred from raising it in a second MTD [1].

Furthermore, the element of identity of parties required for *res judicata* was lacking. Joaquin was not a party in the former case, and his alleged vendor, Marcos Agustin, was never within the jurisdiction of the court in that prior case due to failure to serve summons [2]. Finally, the Court emphasized that where plaintiffs claim to have been fraudulently and criminally deprived of property, technicalities should not bar the vindication of legitimate grievances, and a formal trial should be held to ventilate the issues (*Ronquillo v. Marasigan*, L-11621) [3].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS (if any)
None.
