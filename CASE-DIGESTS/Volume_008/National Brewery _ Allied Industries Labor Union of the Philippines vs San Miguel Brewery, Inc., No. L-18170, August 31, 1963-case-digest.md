I. CAPTION
**NATIONAL BREWERY & ALLIED INDUSTRIES LABOR UNION OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC., THE INDEPENDENT SAN MIGUEL BREWERY WORKERS' ASSOCIATION and ALL OTHER UNKNOWN NON-UNION WORKERS OF THE SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC.**, G.R. No. L-18170, August 31, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Union, the bargaining representative for San Miguel Brewery's regular daily workers, executed a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with the respondent Company on October 2, 1959. The CBA contained a clause (Art. II, Sec. 4) requiring the Company to deduct a "Union agency fee" from the wages of non-union workers, provided they authorized the deduction in writing or a competent court directed it [1].

The respondent Independent San Miguel Brewery Workers' Association and other non-union employees refused to pay the fee or authorize the deduction. Consequently, the Company refused to deduct the fees [2]. Petitioner filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to collect the fees. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. No. 875) did not authorize agency fees and that such fees could not be justified under quasi-contract or agency principles [3]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the collection of a union agency fee from non-union employees is valid under the Industrial Peace Act.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. The Court held that the right of employees to self-organization, which includes the right to refrain from assisting labor organizations (Sec. 3, R.A. No. 875), is fundamental. It yields only to a valid closed-shop agreement as provided in Sec. 4(a)(4) of the Act [4].

Adopting the principle in *General Motors Corp.* (130 NLRB 481), the Court ruled that where parties are not free to require union membership as a condition of employment, they cannot require a lesser form of union security, such as an agency shop/fee. Since a closed-shop agreement cannot validly apply to employees already in the service and members of another union (*Freeman Shirt Mfg. Co. v. CIR*), an agency fee cannot be imposed on them either [5, 6].

Furthermore, the fee cannot be justified on the principle of quasi-contract or "unjust enrichment." Benefits of a CBA must extend to all employees to avoid discrimination (*International Oil Factory Workers Union v. Martinez*), and the Union voluntarily assumes the duty to represent the whole unit. Non-members are not "free riders" liable for fees, nor is there an implied agency relationship, proven by the fact that these employees voted against the Petitioner union [7-9].

The orders of the lower court are **AFFIRMED** [10].
