I. CAPTION
**GENARO VISARRA v. CESAR MIRAFLOR, G.R. No. L-20508, May 16, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.**

II. FACTS
This is a quo warranto proceeding regarding a position in the Commission on Elections (COMELEC). In *Republic v. Imperial* (1955), the Supreme Court established three fixed lines of succession for the COMELEC: (1) Chairman, (2) Second Member, and (3) Third Member, with staggered terms.

On May 12, 1960, Gaudencio Garcia, then occupying the Third Member line (with a term expiring June 20, 1962), was appointed Chairman. On the same day, Petitioner Genaro Visarra was appointed Member "for a term expiring June 20, 1968." In August 1962, Juan V. Borra was appointed Chairman to succeed Garcia. In November 1962, President Macapagal appointed Respondent Cesar Miraflor as Member, assuming Visarra's term had expired in June 1962 (the expiration of Garcia's original Third Member line). Visarra challenged Miraflor’s appointment, arguing that when Garcia became Chairman, Garcia did not leave the Third Member line, and thus Visarra had been appointed to the vacancy left by former Chairman Carag (whose line expired in 1968).

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Petitioner Visarra’s term of office expired in June 1962, validating the appointment of Respondent Miraflor.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court dismissed the petition, ruling that Visarra's term expired on June 20, 1962.

Citing *Republic v. Imperial* and *Nacionalista Party v. Vera*, the Court held that when a Member of the Commission is promoted to Chairman, he leaves his original line of succession and enters the Chairman's line. Consequently, when Garcia was promoted to Chairman in 1960, he vacated the Third Member line. Visarra, appointed to succeed Garcia, merely occupied the position vacated by him.

Although Visarra’s appointment paper specified a term expiring in 1968, his tenure could not extend beyond the fixed term of the position he occupied in the fixed line of succession. Since the Third Member line vacated by Garcia was set to expire on June 20, 1962, Visarra's term legally ended on that date. Therefore, the position became vacant in June 1962, and Respondent Miraflor was validly appointed to fill it.

The petition for quo warranto was **DISMISSED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
*   **Bautista Angelo, J. (Concurring):** Reaffirmed *Nacionalista Party v. Vera*, stating that the constitutional prohibition on reappointment applies only after a commissioner has served the full nine years. Promotion to Chairman is not prohibited.
*   **Makalintal, J. (Concurring):** The Chairman's position is distinct from that of members. Garcia's appointment as Chairman was not challenged in a proper quo warranto case and retains the presumption of validity; thus, he vacated his member seat.
*   **Concepcion, J. (Dissenting):** The prohibition on reappointment is absolute to ensure independence. Garcia’s promotion was void; he remained in his line. Visarra filled the only actual vacancy (Carag's line), which expires in 1968.
*   **Reyes, J.B.L., J. (Dissenting):** Promotion from Member to Chairman violates the constitutional prohibitions against reappointment and salary increase. Garcia’s promotion was void *ab initio*. Visarra validly filled the vacancy of ex-Chairman Carag for a full nine-year term ending in 1968.
*   **Barrera, J. (Dissenting):** The majority view disrupts the staggered rotation and allows a President to potentially appoint all three members. Tenure cannot be separated from the term.
*   **Dizon, J. (Dissenting):** Chairmanship is incidental to membership. A promoted member does not leave his original line. Visarra was appointed to the vacancy left by Carag (expiring 1968).
