I. CAPTION
**THE BACHRACH MOTOR CO., INC. v. UNIVERSAL TRADING CO., INC., ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-13064, June 29, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On October 12, 1928, Bachrach Motor Co., Inc. (Bachrach) entered into a 25-year lease contract with the Government of the Philippine Islands for a parcel of land in the Port Area, Manila. The 7th clause of the contract prohibited Bachrach from subleasing the premises or encumbering improvements without the written permission of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources [1, 2]. Bachrach constructed a building on the land.

On April 10, 1946, without government permission, Bachrach subleased the building to Universal Trading Co., Inc. (Universal Trading) for five years at P4,500.00 per month [3]. Universal Trading repaired the building and paid rentals until May 1, 1947, when the Director of Lands objected to the sublease. On September 15, 1947, the Director cancelled Bachrach’s lease for violation of the 7th clause and forfeited the improvements in favor of the Government [4]. Subsequently, the Government leased the land directly to Universal Trading and sold the improvements to them [5].

Bachrach filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to annul the cancellation and collect unpaid rentals. Universal Trading argued it stopped paying Bachrach because the Director of Lands ordered direct payment to the Bureau. The CFI dismissed the complaint against the Government, upholding the cancellation and forfeiture, but ordered Universal Trading to pay Bachrach rentals from June 1, 1947, to March 16, 1948 [6, 7]. Both parties appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the sublease of the building constituted a violation of the prohibition against subleasing the land without government consent.
2. W/N the forfeiture of the improvements in favor of the Government was valid.
3. W/N Universal Trading is liable to pay rentals to Bachrach for the period between the objection of the Director of Lands and the receipt of the cancellation order.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The sublease violated the contract. Bachrach's contention that the sublease covered only the building and not the land is untenable. The sublease granted exclusive use of the entire edifice, which covered an area substantially amounting to the entire land leased [8]. A sublease of the building necessarily includes the land on which it stands, especially when the contract authorizes the sublessee to make additions and improvements on the premises [8, 9].

2. **YES.** The 11th clause of the lease contract expressly provided that upon breach, the Government may elect to declare the lease forfeited and "enter and take possession of the said premises and all improvements actually existing thereon" [10]. This provision implies that improvements are subject to forfeiture upon breach. The only instance where the Government is obliged to pay for improvements is under the 14th clause, which applies to cancellation for public interest, not breach of contract [11, 12].

3. **YES.** Universal Trading is liable for rentals from June 1, 1947, to March 16, 1948. There was no evidence that Universal Trading actually paid rentals to the Bureau of Lands for this period [12]. Furthermore, the Director's order requiring direct payment to the Bureau was only received by Universal Trading on February 27, 1948, and by Bachrach on March 16, 1948 [13]. Therefore, the obligation to pay Bachrach subsisted until the cancellation order was formally received [14].

Decision affirmed [15].
