I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PEDRO SARMIENTO, G.R. No. L-19146, May 31, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Pedro Sarmiento was charged with murder for shooting Baldestamon. Sarmiento claimed self-defense, alleging the deceased was wielding a bolo. However, physical evidence showed that while the hilt of the bolo was hit by a bullet, the deceased’s hands were unwounded, indicating he was not holding the weapon. Furthermore, the shot was fired from a distance of 24 meters. The Court of First Instance of Antique convicted Sarmiento but ruled out the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation. On appeal, the Court of Appeals agreed that self-defense was not established but opined that the crime was Murder qualified by evident premeditation based on prior threats, and thus certified the case to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Sarmiento acted in self-defense.
2. W/N the killing was qualified by treachery.
3. W/N the killing was qualified by evident premeditation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The claim of self-defense is untenable. The physical evidence—specifically that the bolo's hilt was damaged but the victim's hands were uninjured—proved the victim was not wielding the weapon when shot. Additionally, the distance of 24 meters between the parties negates the existence of immediate aggression that would justify self-defense [1, 2].

2. **NO.** Treachery exists when the offender employs means, methods, or forms which tend directly and specially to insure execution without risk to himself (Art. 14, par. 16, Revised Penal Code) [3]. The Supreme Court held that the sole fact that the deceased was shot from the left side does not, in itself, prove the treacherous nature of the killing [3]. The trial court's assessment discrediting the witness testimony on this point was upheld [4].

3. **NO.** Evident premeditation requires proof that the defendant deliberately planned the crime and persistently followed such plan after sufficient time for "meditation and deep reflection" [5]. Mere threats to kill made days prior, without evidence of a deliberate plan or acts of preparation, do not justify a finding of evident premeditation (People v. Upao Moro) [5]. The shooting occurred unexpectedly while Sarmiento was plowing a field, contradicting the theory of a cold and reflective plan [6].

The decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED [7].
