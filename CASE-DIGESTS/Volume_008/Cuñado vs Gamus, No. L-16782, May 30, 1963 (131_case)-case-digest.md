I. CAPTION
SILVESTRE CUÑADO v. DAVID GAMUS, Mayor of Mabini, DOROTEO MONISA, Municipal Treasurer of Mabini, and PACIFICO RUIZ, Provincial Auditor; INOCENTES VALLECERA and CRESENCIANO ASA v. DAVID GAMUS, et al., G.R. Nos. L-16782 and L-16783, May 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cuñado was the permanent Chief of Police of Mabini, Bohol. Petitioners Vallecera and Asa were temporary policemen who were war veterans but not civil service eligibles. All three were suspended and subsequently dismissed by Respondent Mayor Gamus in 1956 based on administrative charges [1-3]. On appeal, the Commissioner of Civil Service exonerated all petitioners. Cuñado was ordered reinstated, which the Mayor effected, but the Mayor refused to pay his back salaries during the suspension [1, 4]. The Commissioner did not order the reinstatement of Vallecera and Asa, noting their appointments were temporary under Sec. 682 of the Revised Administrative Code [5]. Vallecera and Asa were replaced by other non-eligibles [6].

The lower court ruled in favor of all petitioners, ordering the payment of Cuñado's back salaries and the reinstatement with back wages for Vallecera and Asa [4, 7]. Respondents appealed, arguing Cuñado had "abandoned" his office by claiming to be a "civilian" during his dismissal, and that Vallecera and Asa had no fixed tenure [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Cuñado is entitled to back salaries despite the allegation of abandonment and lack of appropriation.
2. W/N Vallecera and Asa are entitled to reinstatement and back salaries as veterans holding temporary appointments.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Cuñado is entitled to back salaries. Abandonment of public office must be total and made under circumstances indicating absolute relinquishment (*Summers v. Ozaeta*). Cuñado's remark that he was a "civilian" after his dismissal did not constitute a waiver of his right to back pay upon exoneration [9, 10]. Furthermore, Mandamus lies to compel the Mayor to approve the salary voucher as a remedy for official inaction, regardless of whether funds were immediately appropriated by the Municipal Council [11].

2. **NO.** Vallecera and Asa are not entitled to reinstatement or back salaries. One holding a temporary appointment has no fixed tenure and may be terminated at the pleasure of the appointing power without cause (*Quiatchon v. Villanueva*). Their appointments under Sec. 682 of the Revised Administrative Code lapsed three months after issuance [12, 13]. While veterans enjoy preference under RA 65 and RA 1363, this right is not absolute; they must be certified, qualified in an exam, and have applied for preference (*Galon v. Cordova*) [14]. Lacking these requisites, they had no standing to object to replacement by other non-eligibles [13].

In G.R. No. L-16782, the decision is **AFFIRMED**. In G.R. No. L-16783, the decision is **REVERSED**, declaring Vallecera and Asa not entitled to reinstatement or back salaries [15].
