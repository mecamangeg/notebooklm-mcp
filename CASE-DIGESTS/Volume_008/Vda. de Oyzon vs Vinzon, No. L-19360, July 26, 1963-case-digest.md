I. CAPTION
SILVESTRA DEYMOS VDA. DE OYZON v. HON. DEMETRIO G. VINZON and CATALINO PANAO, G.R. No. L-19360, July 26, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Vda. de Oyzon filed a civil case against respondent Panao in the Court of First Instance of Carigara, Leyte. After receiving an adverse decision on October 4, 1961, petitioner filed a Notice of Appeal, Appeal Bond, and Record on Appeal on October 18, 1961, well within the 30-day reglementary period [1]. Panao objected to the Record on Appeal, claiming it lacked certain documents. On October 28, 1961, the trial court ordered the inclusion of the missing proceedings, stating that upon compliance, the record would be approved *ipso facto*, but did not set a specific deadline for compliance [2, 3]. Petitioner filed the Amended Record on Appeal on November 11, 1961 (14 days later) [3]. However, the trial court denied approval, ruling that the amended record was filed beyond the 30-day reglementary period which had already expired [4]. Petitioner filed a petition for mandamus to compel the judge to approve the appeal [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal was perfected on time despite the Amended Record on Appeal being filed after the 30-day reglementary period.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the appeal was perfected on time. The Amended Record on Appeal is deemed to have been filed on the presentation of the original record on appeal, which was indisputably filed within the reglementary period [6]. The Court applied the principle that amendments in pleadings relate back to the date of the original filing, citing *Phil. Ind. Church v. Mateo* [7]. Furthermore, since the trial court's order to amend did not specify a period for compliance, the petitioner's submission within 14 days was considered done within a reasonable time [6].

The Writ is GRANTED; the orders denying the approval are set aside, and the respondent Judge is ordered to approve the amended record on appeal and give due course to the appeal [8].
