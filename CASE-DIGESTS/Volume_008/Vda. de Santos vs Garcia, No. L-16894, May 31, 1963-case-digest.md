I. CAPTION
MODESTA VDA. DE SANTOS v. DANIEL GARCIA, G.R. No. L-16894, May 31, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Daniel Garcia, a tenant, reaped a portion of the 1958-1959 palay crop without the knowledge and consent of the petitioner-landholder, Modesta Vda. de Santos [1, 2]. This act was contrary to Section 39 of R.A. No. 1199 and Garcia's assurance to petitioner's son that all harvest had already been taken to the threshing site [1]. The unauthorized reaping involved approximately two cavans, with the landowner's share valued at only P4.20 to P7.70 [3]. Petitioner filed a case with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) seeking Garcia's ejectment [1]. The CAR initially ordered ejectment but reversed its decision upon a motion for reconsideration, ruling that ejecting a tenant for such an "insignificant amount" would be "revolting against the conscience" [4]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the tenant should be ejected for reaping crops without the landholder's consent when the amount involved is insignificant.

IV. RULING
**NO.** While a literal interpretation of Section 39 of R.A. No. 1199 (as amended by R.A. No. 2263) makes it unlawful to reap crops without mutual consent and could warrant ejectment, the Court must be guided by the principles of social welfare legislation [5, 6]. Under Section 56 of the Tenancy Law and Article 1702 of the Civil Code, all doubts in the interpretation of labor and tenancy laws must be resolved in favor of the tenant or worker [5, 6]. The Court held that since the value of the palay involved was relatively insignificant (P7.70 at most), depriving the tenant of his livelihood would be an excessive penalty [4, 5]. The resolution of the Court of Agrarian Relations denying the ejectment is AFFIRMED [7].
