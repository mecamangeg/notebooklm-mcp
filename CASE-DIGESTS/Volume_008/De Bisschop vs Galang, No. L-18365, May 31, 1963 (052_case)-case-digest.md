I. CAPTION
GEORGE DE BISSCHOP v. EMILIO L. GALANG, in his capacity as Commissioner of Immigration, G.R. No. L-18365, May 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner George de Bisschop, an American citizen, was allowed to stay in the Philippines for three years as a prearranged employee of Bissmag Production, Inc., expiring on August 1, 1959. He applied for an extension of stay on July 10, 1959 [1]. However, due to confidential reports that his company was a "gambling front" and that he was suspected of evading income tax, the Board of Commissioners denied his application [1]. The Commissioner of Immigration advised him to depart within five days. De Bisschop's counsel requested a copy of the Board's decision, but was informed that pursuant to immigration practice, no formal decision is promulgated for denials; the denial was merely recorded as votes by the Board members [2, 3].

To forestall his arrest and deportation, De Bisschop filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI granted the petition and issued a preliminary injunction, ordering the Commissioner to desist from expelling the petitioner until proper proceedings were conducted [3, 4]. The Commissioner appealed, arguing that formal hearings and written decisions are not required for extension of stay applications [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Commissioners of Immigration are required to conduct formal hearings on applications for extension of stay of aliens.
2. W/N the Board of Commissioners is required to promulgate written decisions in such cases.
3. W/N the writ of prohibition is the proper remedy to test the legality of an alien's proposed expulsion.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Philippine Immigration Act of 1940 (Commonwealth Act No. 613) is silent on the procedure for extending an alien's stay. Courts cannot review the administrative practice of not granting formal hearings for reasons of practicability and expediency [5]. A day in court is not a matter of right in administrative proceedings, and due process is not violated because the requirement to leave is merely a preliminary step before actual deportation proceedings [5].

2. **NO.** There is nothing in the immigration law requiring written decisions for petitions for extension of stay [6]. Section 8 of the Immigration Act, which mentions "decision," refers to the number of *votes* necessary (two members) to constitute a decision, not a written document. The law specifically enumerates when written decisions are required (e.g., appeals on admission/exclusion, deportation cases), but extensions of stay are not included [6].

3. **NO.** Prohibition is not the proper remedy as it only issues in cases of extreme necessity where there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy (Section 2, Rule 67, Rules of Court) [7]. The proper remedy to test the legality of an alien's confinement and proposed expulsion is *habeas corpus*, which is a settled practice and bars the issuance of a writ of prohibition [7, 8].

The order appealed from is **REVERSED**, the petition for prohibition is **DISMISSED**, and the writ of preliminary injunction is **DISSOLVED** [9].
