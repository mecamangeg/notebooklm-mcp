I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES (Represented by the Land Tenure Administration) v. MANUEL SAMIA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17569, May 31, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
The Republic of the Philippines, through the Land Tenure Administration, filed a complaint to expropriate 21 parcels of land in Tondo, Manila, owned by Manuel Samia and others, pursuant to Republic Act (R.A.) No. 1162 [1]. The complaint was later amended to include 10 other parcels in a different location (Jose Abad Santos Ave. and Bambang St.) owned by the minor children of the original defendants [2]. In total, the Republic sought to expropriate 31 parcels with a combined area of 38,279.30 square meters, owned by 14 different individuals [2].

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the plaintiff had no right to expropriate the land [3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila suspended the trial and granted the motion to dismiss, citing *Guido v. Rural Progress Administration*, ruling that the properties did not constitute a landed estate [3]. The Republic appealed, contending that a motion to dismiss is improper in expropriation proceedings under Rule 69 and that R.A. No. 2342 (which amended R.A. 1162) authorized the expropriation of "any piece of land" [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a standard motion to dismiss under Rule 8 is proper in expropriation proceedings.
2. W/N the subject properties constitute a "landed estate" subject to expropriation under R.A. No. 1162.
3. W/N R.A. No. 2342, allowing expropriation of "any piece of land," applies retroactively to this case.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Rules of Court do not prohibit the filing of an ordinary motion to dismiss in expropriation proceedings [6]. While a motion to dismiss usually takes the place of an answer in such cases to allow for the presentation of evidence, the court may dismiss the case if the complaint demonstrates that the plaintiff has no valid cause of action [7]. The Court previously sustained a motion to dismiss in *Republic v. Samia* (89 Phil. 483) even after the introduction of evidence [6].

2. **NO.** The properties do not constitute a "landed estate" or "hacienda." To be considered a large estate, the parcels must be contiguous [8]. Here, the lots are located in two different parts of Manila [9]. Furthermore, the Court condemned the practice of grouping small lots owned by different individuals (14 persons in this case) to simulate a vast estate [8]. The largest aggregate area owned by a single individual (Manuel Samia) is only 6,614.50 square meters, which is not a landed estate for expropriation purposes [10].

3. **NO.** R.A. No. 2342, which took effect on June 20, 1959, affects substantive rights and cannot be given retroactive application to a complaint filed in May 1959 [10]. Even if the Act were applicable, the expropriation would still fail because the law requires the land to have been leased for at least ten years and to have at least 50 houses erected thereon [11]. The largest individual group of lots (6,614.50 sqm) cannot accommodate 50 houses if each house requires 150 square meters as prescribed by Section 3 of R.A. No. 1162 [12].

The order dismissing the appeal is **AFFIRMED** [13].
