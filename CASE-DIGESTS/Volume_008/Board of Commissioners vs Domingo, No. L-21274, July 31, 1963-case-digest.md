**I. CAPTION**
BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS, BUREAU OF IMMIGRATION, COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION and SECURITY OFFICER v. HON. FELIX R. DOMINGO and MONICO MUYA, G.R. No. L-21274, July 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Monico Muya (alias Tiu Kim Kee) arrived in the Philippines in 1959 as a Chinese stowaway and was returned to his port of departure. He re-entered in 1962 claiming Filipino citizenship. Upon establishing his identity as the 1959 stowaway through fingerprints, the Board of Immigration Commissioners ordered his exclusion and deportation [1, 2]. After a failed petition in the Manila Court of First Instance (CFI), Muya filed a petition for Declaratory Judgment with Mandamus and Injunction in the CFI of Pangasinan (presided by respondent Judge Domingo), seeking to be declared a Filipino citizen and released from detention [2, 3]. Judge Domingo issued a preliminary mandatory injunction ordering Muya's release [3]. The petitioners sought certiorari, arguing lack of jurisdiction and improper remedy [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N citizenship is a proper subject for a proceeding for declaratory judgment.
2. W/N the trial court acted with abuse of discretion in issuing the mandatory injunction for the respondent's release.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that there is no proceeding established by law or the rules for the judicial declaration of the citizenship of an individual, citing *Palaran v. Republic* and *Tan Yu Chin v. Republic*. Furthermore, citizenship is not a proper subject for declaratory judgment [4].

2. **YES.** The issuance of the injunction was an abuse of discretion and excess of jurisdiction. Since Muya was detained by immigration authorities in Manila, the proper remedy to test the legality of his detention was *habeas corpus* filed in the place of detention (Manila), not an action for declaratory judgment in Pangasinan [5, 6]. Additionally, Muya failed to exhaust administrative remedies by appealing to the Secretary of Justice before seeking judicial intervention [5].

The writ of certiorari is **GRANTED**; the orders and writ of injunction issued by the respondent court are **ANNULLED and SET ASIDE** [7].
