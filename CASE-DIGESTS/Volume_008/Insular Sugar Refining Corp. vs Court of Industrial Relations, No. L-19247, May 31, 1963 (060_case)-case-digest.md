I. CAPTION
INSULAR SUGAR REFINING CORPORATION v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and INSUREFCO & PAPER PULP PROJECT WORKERS UNION, G.R. No. L-19247, May 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In 1952, the respondent Union staged a strike against the old Insular Sugar Refining Corporation (old INSUREFCO), then owned by the Philippine Sugar Institute (PHILSUGIN). The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) declared the strike illegal and authorized the dismissal of those responsible. Consequently, several employees were dismissed in 1954. The Union later sought to reopen the case, alleging that 39 dismissed workers were not responsible for the strike and were thus illegally dismissed.

On February 7, 1961, PHILSUGIN sold the assets of the old INSUREFCO to the petitioner, the new Insular Sugar Refining Corporation (new INSUREFCO), a distinct private corporation registered shortly before the sale. The contract of sale stipulated that the new INSUREFCO had the discretion to retain only such personnel as it deemed necessary and would not be liable for prior claims arising from the employer-employee relationship with PHILSUGIN, although it agreed to pay separation pay to non-retained personnel. Despite the new INSUREFCO's objection, the CIR included it as a party to the pending case regarding the 39 workers. The new INSUREFCO filed a petition for certiorari challenging the CIR's jurisdiction.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction to compel the new INSUREFCO to reinstate employees dismissed by the old INSUREFCO.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the CIR cannot compel the vendee of a business establishment to reinstate employees with whom it had no previous employer-employee relationship [1, 2]. The new INSUREFCO and the old INSUREFCO are admittedly distinct entities, and there was no allegation that the sale was fictitious or intended to evade liability [3].

The Court held that mere knowledge by the vendee of a pending labor case does not make it an accomplice in an unfair labor practice. Since the contract of sale expressly reserved the new INSUREFCO's discretion to retain personnel, it cannot be required to keep the discharged laborers [2, 3]. Any claim the workers might have against the new INSUREFCO is limited to the stipulated separation pay under the contract. Such a claim is a pure money claim unconnected to any unfair labor practice, the Eight-Hour Labor Law, or the Minimum Wage Act, and therefore must be prosecuted in the regular courts of first instance, not the CIR [3-5].

The writ of certiorari was granted, and the CIR order was set aside [6].
