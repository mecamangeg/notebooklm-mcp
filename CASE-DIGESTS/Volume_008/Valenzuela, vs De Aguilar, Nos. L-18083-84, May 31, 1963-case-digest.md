I. CAPTION
JESUS Z. VALENZUELA v. IRENE Z. DE AGUILAR, G.R. Nos. L-18083-84, May 31, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Irene Z. de Aguilar was the judgment debtor in a civil case for a sum of money. A writ of execution was issued, and the Provincial Sheriff levied on her land in La Union. The Sheriff published the notice of public auction but failed to file a notice of levy with the Register of Deeds prior to the sale [1]. The auction took place on March 18, 1953, with petitioner Jesus Z. Valenzuela (the judgment creditor’s lawyer) as the highest bidder [1].

No redemption having been made, the Sheriff executed a Certificate of Absolute Definitive Deed of Sale on April 20, 1954, which was registered with the Register of Deeds on April 28, 1954 [1]. Valenzuela took possession and collected rents without objection from Aguilar [1]. In 1957, Valenzuela applied for land registration, which Aguilar opposed. In 1958, five years after the auction, Aguilar filed an action to annul the sale, arguing the levy was invalid due to non-registration [2, 3]. The CFI ruled in favor of Valenzuela, but the Court of Appeals reversed, declaring the sale void for lack of a valid levy citing *Llenares v. Valdeavella* [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the execution sale is valid despite the Sheriff's failure to file the notice of levy with the Register of Deeds prior to the auction.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and affirmed the CFI.

While the general rule in *Iturralde* and *Llenares* is that a valid levy is essential to the validity of an execution sale, and a levy on real property is invalid if the notice is not filed with the Register of Deeds (Section 14, Rule 39, in relation to Section 7[e], Rule 59 of the Rules of Court), this requirement is primarily to notify third parties [6-8].

In this case, no third parties were involved, and the substantial rights of the judgment debtor (Aguilar) were not impaired by the non-registration prior to the sale [8]. Furthermore, Aguilar was guilty of laches having failed to object to Valenzuela's possession and collection of rents for five years, and having stopped paying real estate taxes [8, 9]. The subsequent registration of the Certificate of Absolute Sale, coupled with Valenzuela's actual possession, served as a constructive levy, effectively notifying the world that the property was being held to satisfy the judgment [9, 10].

**ACCORDINGLY**, the decision of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED**, and that of the Court of First Instance is **AFFIRMED**.
