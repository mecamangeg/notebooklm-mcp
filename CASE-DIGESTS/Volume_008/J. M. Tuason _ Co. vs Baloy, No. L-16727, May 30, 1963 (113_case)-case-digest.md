**I. CAPTION**
*J. M. TUASON & CO. v. RICARDO BALOY*, G.R. No. L-16727, May 30, 1963, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
On June 7, 1959, J.M. Tuason & Co. filed a case against Ricardo Baloy to recover possession of a 550-square-meter parcel of land and to collect monthly rentals from April 1949. The Court of First Instance of Rizal (Quezon City) rendered a decision in favor of Tuason on October 21, 1959. This decision became final and executory, and a writ of execution was issued on December 5, 1959. On December 16, 1959, Baloy filed a petition for relief from judgment. The trial court denied the petition, ruling that it did not comply with the Rules of Court as it lacked an affidavit of merit and failed to allege fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence. Baloy appealed this denial to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petition for relief from judgment was properly denied due to the insufficiency of the affidavit of merit.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. Under **Rule 38 of the Rules of Court**, a petition for relief must be verified and accompanied by an affidavit of merit. This affidavit must set forth facts sufficient to constitute one of the grounds for relief—fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence—and show a valid defense.

In this case, the petition was initially filed without the required affidavit. While an affidavit subscribed by Baloy's counsel appeared in the Record on Appeal (presumably to cure the defect), the Court found it "clearly insufficient." The factual allegations therein failed to prove any fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence, nor did they demonstrate a valid defense in favor of the party seeking relief. Without meeting these mandatory requirements, the petition for relief could not prosper.

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
