I. CAPTION
RUPERTO SANCHEZ, doing business under the name and style of PRESERVER SHOE COMPANY and MODESTO SANCHEZ v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, PRESERVER SHOE WORKERS' UNION-NAFLU, FRANCISCO TORRIGOZA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19000, July 31, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
The respondent Preserver Shoe Workers' Union filed a complaint for unfair labor practices against petitioners, alleging refusal to bargain collectively and the illegal dismissal of union officers Francisco Torrigoza and Julian Regente [1]. Petitioners denied the existence of an employer-employee relationship, arguing that their business involved manufacturing shoes only for specific contracts (e.g., for the Armed Forces) secured via public bidding [2]. Petitioners claimed that the employment of the respondent workers was temporary and automatically terminated upon the completion of the last contract on May 17, 1958, prior to the strike on May 21, 1958 [2]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled in favor of the Union, ordering the reinstatement of the dismissed workers with back wages [3]. The CIR found that the petitioners had been in business for over 20 years and that many respondents had been working continuously for them since as early as 1947, disregarding the "contract worker" forms signed by employees as having been altered with recent stamps [4-6]. Petitioners appealed, challenging the CIR's jurisdiction on the ground that no employer-employee relationship existed [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over the case based on the existence of an employer-employee relationship between the parties.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Industrial Relations. The Court held that the CIR's jurisdiction was properly grounded because the finding that the employer-employee relationship had not been terminated on May 17, 1958, was supported by substantial evidence [6, 8]. The Court cited evidence showing that petitioners had been in business for decades and that the workers had been employed for years, not merely for the duration of specific supply contracts [9, 10]. Furthermore, the Court upheld the CIR's rejection of the "contract worker" forms, noting they were not binding as the stamps were placed recently [6]. The Court emphasized that the CIR is governed by the rule of substantial evidence rather than the rule of preponderance of evidence used in ordinary civil cases [8, 11]. The decision of the CIR was affirmed [11].
