I. CAPTION
BINALBAGAN-ISABELA SUGAR CO., INC. (BISCOM) v. PHILIPPINE ASSOCIATION OF FREE LABOR UNIONS (PAFLU), ET AL., G.R. No. L-18782, August 29, 1963, 8 SCRA 700, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner BISCOM entered into a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the Fraternal Labor Organization (FLO) on May 3, 1957, which contained a closed-shop clause [1]. However, prior to this execution, another union, the Free Visayan Workers Union, had already filed a petition for certification election on December 8, 1956, raising a doubt as to majority representation [2]. On March 4, 1959, BISCOM and FLO renewed the CBA [3].

Employees Enrique Entila and Victoriano Tenazas, though signatories to the CBA, joined respondent PAFLU and campaigned for it [3, 4]. Consequently, FLO expelled them for misconduct and demanded their dismissal pursuant to the closed-shop provision [4]. BISCOM dismissed them on May 31, 1959 [4]. Entila, Tenazas, and PAFLU filed a complaint for unfair labor practice [5]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled in favor of the employees, ordering reinstatement with back wages, finding that: (1) the employees were supervisors; (2) they were denied due process by FLO; and (3) the CBA was illegal as it was executed while a certification election case was pending [2, 6]. BISCOM appealed [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) executed between BISCOM and FLO is valid despite a pending certification election.
2. W/N the dismissal of Entila and Tenazas was legal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A collective bargaining agreement is illegal where it was entered into with a union which was not certified by the court as the one chosen by the employees as their collective bargaining representative, particularly when there is a dispute as to majority representation [7, 8]. A labor union cannot, on its own accord, determine the question of majority membership [9]. In this case, a petition for certification election was already pending when BISCOM and FLO executed the CBA; thus, the unilateral determination of majority representation was improper and the resulting contract was void [2, 10].

2. **NO.** The dismissal was illegal. Firstly, it was based on a closed-shop provision in a CBA that the Court declared concluded not in accordance with law [10]. Secondly, the Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's factual finding that the employees were denied due process during their expulsion from the union [11, 12]. Tenazas did not undergo impeachment proceedings as required by the by-laws, and Entila was not given a proper hearing [11]. An expulsion violative of due process renders the consequent dismissal illegal [7].

Petition denied. Decision affirmed.
