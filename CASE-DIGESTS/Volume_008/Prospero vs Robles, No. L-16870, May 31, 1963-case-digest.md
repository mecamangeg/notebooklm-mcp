I. CAPTION
ELOY PROSPERO v. ALFREDO ROBLES, IGNACIO LOYOLA, EMILIO MAGCALOS, LUCIO BERSAMIN and ANDOY "DOE", G.R. No. L-16870, May 31, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Eloy Prospero filed an action for damages and injunction against Alfredo Robles and other defendants to stop them from picketing premises where Prospero performed musical services [1, 2]. After their motion to dismiss was denied, defendants failed to file an answer. On July 8, 1959, the trial court declared them in default, received evidence *ex parte*, and rendered judgment ordering them to pay damages and permanently refrain from picketing [2, 3]. Defendants admitted they had knowledge of the default judgment on October 21, 1959 [4, 5]. On January 8, 1960—79 days after learning of the judgment—defendants filed a petition for relief from judgment, alleging the default was due to the mistake or excusable negligence of their former counsel [5, 6]. The lower court denied the petition for being filed out of time and for lacking a sufficient affidavit of merit [5]. Defendants appealed, challenging the denial and the court's jurisdiction over what they claimed was a labor dispute [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for relief from judgment was filed within the reglementary period.
2. W/N the petition for relief was supported by a sufficient affidavit of merit.
3. W/N the lower court had jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petition was filed out of time. Under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court, a petition for relief must be filed within sixty (60) days after the petitioner learns of the judgment, order, or other proceeding to be set aside [4]. Appellants admitted they knew of the default judgment on October 21, 1959, but only filed the petition on January 8, 1960. This interval of seventy-nine (79) days exceeded the mandatory sixty-day period [5, 8].

2. **NO.** The petition was insufficient in form and substance. A mere allegation that default was due to "gross negligence" or "abandonment" of counsel, without stating the specific facts constituting such negligence, is not legally sufficient to justify relief [9, 10]. Furthermore, to merit relief, the affidavit of merit must contain specific facts that would convince the court the party has a meritorious case; a general allegation that the party has "good and strong evidence" is a mere conclusion and does not satisfy the requirements of Rule 38 [7, 9].

3. **YES.** The lower court had jurisdiction. While appellants contended that the picketing was a legitimate exercise of freedom of speech in a labor dispute, the trial court made an express factual finding that there was "totally no employer-employee relations" between the parties [11, 12]. Because of this finding, which could not be reviewed by the Supreme Court, the action was correctly treated as an ordinary suit for damages and a restraining order, cognizable by the regular courts [7, 12].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [13].
