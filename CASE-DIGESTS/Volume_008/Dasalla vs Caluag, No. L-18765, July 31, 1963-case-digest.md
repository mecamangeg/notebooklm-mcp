I. CAPTION
ADRIANO D. DASALLA, ET AL. v. THE HON. JUDGE HERMOGENES CALUAG, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18765, July 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to annul a deed of mortgage and its foreclosure against private respondents Francisco T. Koh and Republic Surety & Insurance Co., Inc. [1]. The CFI dismissed the complaint and ordered petitioners to pay damages [2]. Petitioners filed a notice of appeal, appeal bond, and record on appeal within the reglementary period [3]. Respondents moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing it was manifestly dilatory and prejudicial to their substantial rights [4]. The CFI dismissed the appeal on these grounds [5]. Petitioners filed a petition for *Mandamus* to compel the judge to give due course to the appeal [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may dismiss an appeal on the ground that it is manifestly dilatory.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The grounds relied upon by the trial court (that the appeal is dilatory or prejudicial) are not among the grounds for dismissal enumerated in Rule 52 of the Rules of Court [6]. Even if the appeal were frivolous or intended for delay, the right to pass upon that question belongs to the appellate court, not the court *a quo* [7]. The trial court cannot prevent a party from appealing its decision, no matter how frivolous, because that prerogative and the power to impose costs for frivolous appeals (under Rule 131) lie with the appellate court [7]. Once the steps in Rule 41 are taken (filing notice, bond, and record on appeal), the appeal is perfected, and it becomes the duty of the trial court to give due course to it [6].

Petition granted; respondent court is ordered to give due course to the appeal.
