I. CAPTION
POLICARPIO GEGANTO v. QUINTIN KATALBAS, JESUS BAUTISTA and CARLOS CHAVEZ, G.R. No. L-17105, July 31, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellant Policarpio Geganto filed an action for damages for malicious prosecution against defendants-appellees Quintin Katalbas (Mayor), Jesus Bautista (Chief of Police), and Carlos Chavez (Police Sergeant) of Sagay [1]. Geganto alleged that the officers induced him to acknowledge guilt for a crime by threatening him with a graver charge of murder, and induced a witness, Wilfredo Mangubat, to sign a false incriminating affidavit used to support a homicide complaint against him [1]. Geganto sought P2,000.00 in attorney's fees spent defending himself [2].

The appellees moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it stated no cause of action [2]. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental granted the motion and dismissed the complaint on May 27, 1960 [2, 3]. Geganto appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a cause of action.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal. The Court reasoned that the ground relied upon in the motion to dismiss (failure to state a cause of action) did not appear to be "indubitable" [2]. Therefore, the trial court should have held the resolution of the motion in abeyance until after the trial on the merits [2].

The Court noted that if the facts alleged were established by competent evidence, the appellant would be entitled to relief, specifically judgment for attorney's fees and expenses of litigation under **Art. 2208, No. 11 of the New Civil Code**, which allows recovery where the court deems it just and equitable [2].

The order appealed from is set aside and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [4].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Bengzon, C.J.** concurred in the result, citing Articles 20 (liability for illegal acts), 27 (refusal/neglect of official duty), and 32 (violation of constitutional rights) of the New Civil Code as bases for the decision [4].
