I. CAPTION
BOARD OF ASSESSMENT APPEALS, PROVINCE OF LAGUNA v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS and THE NATIONAL WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY (NAWASA), G.R. No. L-18125, May 31, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
NAWASA, a public corporation owned by the Government, took over the Cabuyao-Sta. Rosa-Biñan Waterworks System formerly owned by the Province of Laguna pursuant to Republic Act No. 1383 [1]. In 1956, the Provincial Assessor of Laguna assessed real estate taxes on the water pipes, reservoir, intake, and buildings comprising the system [2, 3]. NAWASA protested the assessment, claiming exemption under its charter. The Board of Assessment Appeals overruled the protest [4]. On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) reversed the Board’s decision and ruled that the properties were exempt [5]. The Board filed a petition for review, arguing that while the properties belong to the Republic, they are held in a proprietary (patrimonial) capacity, not a governmental one, and are therefore subject to tax under Commonwealth Act No. 470 and Republic Act No. 104 [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the waterworks properties owned by NAWASA are subject to real estate tax.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The properties are exempt. Section 3(a) of Commonwealth Act No. 470 exempts "Property owned by... the Republic of the Philippines" from real estate tax [6]. Since the parties stipulated that the property is owned by the Government, it falls squarely within this exemption [7]. The Court ruled that the law makes no distinction between property held in a sovereign, governmental capacity and that possessed in a private, proprietary, or patrimonial character [8]. Where the law does not distinguish, neither may the courts [8]. The terms "property" and "owned" suggest the exemption is based on dominion (ownership) rather than domain (function) [8]. Additionally, taxing government property would merely take money from one pocket to put it in another [9]. Finally, Section 1 of Republic Act No. 104, which subjects government corporations to taxes, is inapplicable because it refers only to taxes on "transaction, business, industry, sale, or income" and does not include taxes on *property* like real estate tax [10, 11]. The decision of the CTA is affirmed [11].
