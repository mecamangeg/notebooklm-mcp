I. CAPTION
SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC. v. DEMOCRATIC LABOR ORGANIZATION, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18353, July 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Democratic Labor Association filed a complaint against petitioner San Miguel Brewery, Inc. (SMB) for various demands improving employment conditions. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled in favor of the union, ordering SMB to pay: (1) overtime compensation to outside or field sales personnel (salesmen, truck drivers, and helpers) under the Eight-Hour Labor Law; (2) night salary differentials retroactive to dates prior to the specific demand; and (3) additional compensation for watchmen working on Sundays and holidays.

SMB petitioned for review, arguing that its field sales personnel are exempt from the Eight-Hour Labor Law. These employees leave the plant after roll call, follow sales routes planned for 8 hours but variable in actual duration, have no daily time records, and receive a monthly salary plus sales commission. SMB contended that the commission, which depends on the employee's industry, replaces overtime pay, similar to piece-work or *pakiao*. SMB also opposed the retroactivity of night differentials and the additional Sunday pay for monthly-paid watchmen [1-6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N outside or field sales personnel paid on a monthly salary plus commission basis are entitled to overtime compensation under the Eight-Hour Labor Law.
2. W/N the award for night salary differentials should be retroactive prior to the date of the specific legal demand.
3. W/N watchmen paid on a monthly basis are entitled to extra pay for work performed on Sundays and holidays.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Eight-Hour Labor Law has no application to employees paid on a piece-work, *pakiao*, or commission basis. Field sales personnel are essentially commission-based workers because their participation depends on their industry; the more hours they employ, the higher their gross returns. They have no daily time record and are not under the employer's strict time supervision while on their routes. The commission they receive is in lieu of overtime compensation. The Court cited *Jewel Tea Co. v. Williams* and Department of Labor rulings to support that such employees are not covered by the overtime requirements of the Eight-Hour Labor Law [7-10].

2. **YES.** While awards usually apply from the date of demand, the retroactive application is valid here because a similar claim had been filed long before and was the subject of negotiations and a strike. The strike ended with an express understanding that the claim for night salary differentials would be settled in court [11, 12].

3. **YES.** Section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 444 mandatorily provides that no employer may compel an employee to work during Sundays and legal holidays unless paid an additional sum of 25% of their regular compensation. This applies regardless of the nature of the compensation (e.g., monthly basis), with the sole exception of public utilities performing public service [13].

**Disposition:** The decision of the Court of Industrial Relations is MODIFIED. The award regarding extra work for the outside or field sales force is SET ASIDE. The awards for night salary differentials and Sunday/holiday pay for watchmen are AFFIRMED [14].
