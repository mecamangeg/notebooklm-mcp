**I. CAPTION**
CARMEN P. NOVINO and RODOLFO NOVINO vs. THE COURT OF APPEALS, LINA Y. FUENTES, RAFAEL FUENTES and PEOPLE'S HOMESITE AND HOUSING CORPORATION (PHHC), G.R. No. L-21098, May 31, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Carmen Novino sold real property she had acquired from the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC) to respondents Lina and Rafael Fuentes [1]. She later sought to annul the sale, alleging that she did not obtain the consent of her "husband," petitioner Rodolfo Novino [1]. The Court of Appeals (CA) found that her marriage to Rodolfo was null and void *ab initio* because both parties had subsisting marriages to other persons [1]. Consequently, the CA ruled that the sale was valid and Rodolfo's consent was unnecessary [1]. The Supreme Court initially dismissed the petition for review for lack of merit via a minute resolution [2]. Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the summary dismissal violated the Constitutional requirement (Art. VIII, Sec. 12) to state the facts and law, and that the CA failed to apply Art. 144 of the Civil Code regarding property relations in void marriages [1, 2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Supreme Court's denial of a petition via minute resolution violates the Constitutional requirement to state the legal and factual basis of a decision.
2. W/N the sale is void for lack of the "husband's" consent under Art. 144 of the Civil Code.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that resolutions denying petitions for review are not "decisions" within the meaning of Sec. 12, Art. VIII of the Constitution [3, 4]. Petitions for review are not a matter of right but of sound judicial discretion, and the Court is not required to fully explain its denial [3, 4]. This practice helps alleviate the Court's heavy docket and is patterned after the practice of the U.S. Supreme Court [5]. The facts and law were already adequately discussed in the Court of Appeals' opinion [4].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that Art. 144 of the Civil Code, which governs co-ownership in void marriages, is immaterial [6, 7]. The CA impliedly held that at the time Carmen acquired the property, she and Rodolfo were not living together as husband and wife [7]. Furthermore, Carmen cannot invoke her own fault or shortcoming (failure to obtain consent) to invalidate a sale she herself consummated [8, 9]. If the sale were defective, the right to seek annulment would belong to Rodolfo's heirs, not Carmen [9].

**Motion denied.** [10]
