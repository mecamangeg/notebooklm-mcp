I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO JOVELO v. NASARIA VDA. DE BAUTISTA and THE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-16610, May 31, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Francisco Jovelo filed a complaint for illegal dispossession against respondent Nasaria Vda. de Bautista in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). After a previous dismissal and reinstatement, the hearing was set for June 23, 1959. On June 9, petitioner’s counsel received the notice of hearing and immediately filed a motion to admit an amended petition. On June 17, the CAR admitted the amended petition but ordered the hearing to proceed on June 23 as originally scheduled. Petitioner received this order on the day of the hearing and filed a motion for continuance. When the case was called, neither party appeared, and the CAR dismissed the case for failure to prosecute. It was later revealed that the respondent received the order admitting the amended petition only on July 13, 1959, weeks after the scheduled hearing.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal for failure to prosecute was proper when the hearing was held prior to the joinder of issues on the amended petition.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the hearing was premature and improper. Since the CAR Rules do not specify when issues are joined after an amendment, the Rules of Court apply suppletorily (Sec. 1, Rule 17, CAR Rules). Under Section 3, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court, issues are joined only upon the filing of a new answer to the amended complaint or after the expiration of the period to file such answer.

In this case, the respondent had not yet received the order admitting the amended petition by the hearing date of June 23, 1959; thus, the reglementary period to answer had not even commenced. Consequently, the case was not ready for trial. The dismissal orders were set aside, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.
