I. CAPTION
FILEMON DIONELA, ET AL. v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, E. R. SQUIBB AND SONS (PHIL.) AND CARLETON ASHLEY, G.R. No. L-18334, August 31, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
The Gas and Chemical Free Workers (Union) filed unfair labor practice (ULP) charges (Case No. 598-ULP) against respondent E.R. Squibb & Sons and its manager, Carleton Ashley. During the pendency of the case, the Union went on strike, prompting the company to secure an injunction due to alleged violence. Subsequently, the Union and the company reached a compromise agreement to settle all disputes, which included a provision for three months' separation pay for striking employees. Based on this agreement, the Union President and the specific complainants moved to withdraw the ULP charges, which the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) granted, dismissing Case No. 598-ULP.

Petitioners, a minority group of Union members led by Vice-President Dionela, opposed the compromise and filed a "Motion to Disauthorize" the Union's counsel. After the dismissal of the first case, they filed a new ULP complaint (Case No. 895-ULP) alleging refusal to reinstate and citing acts committed during the same period as the previous case. The CIR dismissed the new petition, ruling that the compromise was binding on the minority.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the compromise agreement entered into by the Union is binding upon the minority members who opposed it.
2. W/N the petitioners may split their cause of action by filing subsequent charges for acts committed during the same period covered by the dismissed case.

IV. RULING
**1. YES.** The compromise agreement is binding upon the minority members. Under the rule of the majority, the will of the majority prevails. The minority's action in disauthorizing counsel and filing a new case is contrary to the policy of the Magna Carta of Labor (Republic Act No. 875), which promotes the settlement of industrial disputes by mutual agreement. The Court reasoned that if such dissent were tolerated, no employer would ever enter into a compromise agreement, as minority members could simply dishonor the terms and demand better ones, thereby defeating the purpose of promoting industrial peace.

**2. NO.** The Court ruled that when a labor union charges an employer with unfair labor practices committed during a specific period, the charges must include all acts committed against any and all members during that time. The Union cannot be allowed to split its cause of action and harass the employer with subsequent charges based on acts committed during the same period. The new allegations in the suppletory complaint referred to events prior to the compromise and were deemed included in the settlement.

**Decision affirmed.**
