I. CAPTION
BERNARDO ESTOESTA v. THE MUNICIPAL MAYOR and THE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL OF AGOO, LA UNION, G.R. No. L-18849, June 29, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Bernardo Estoesta, the Chief of Police of Agoo, La Union, was suspended on November 28, 1958, facing administrative charges for misconduct filed by the Municipal Mayor [1]. The Municipal Council heard the case and, on February 28, 1959, passed Resolution No. 26 unanimously adopting a decision finding Estoesta guilty and imposing the penalty of "forced resignation" [2, 3]. This decision was drafted by a committee created by the Council for that specific purpose [1, 2]. The Commissioner of Civil Service upheld the verdict, and an appeal to the Civil Service Board of Appeals was dismissed for being filed late [4].

On September 16, 1960, approximately one and a half years after his forced resignation, Estoesta filed a "Motion for Reinstatement," which was ignored [4]. He then filed a petition for declaratory relief, certiorari, and mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of La Union, challenging the legality of his separation [4, 5]. The CFI dismissed the petition, prompting this appeal to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the decision of the Municipal Council is valid despite being drafted and prepared by a committee.
2. W/N the petitioner's action for reinstatement is barred by laches.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The decision is valid. The Supreme Court held that while the physical draft was penned by a committee, the decision itself was made by the entire Municipal Council as a body [6]. Resolution No. 26 expressly stated that the committee was created *after* the Council had already reached its unanimous verdict and that all Council members affixed their signatures to the decision drafted by the committee [7]. Therefore, the Council merely delegated the actual preparation of the decision after reaching a verdict, which does not invalidate the proceedings [7].

2. **YES.** The petitioner forfeited his right to reinstatement. The Court applied the established doctrine that, for reasons of public policy, an action for reinstatement to a civil service position must be filed within one year [8]. Estoesta delayed for one and a half years before seeking reinstatement [8]. The Court cited *Unabia v. Mayor of Cebu*, *Gonzales v. Rodriguez*, and *Mesias v. Jover* in ruling that his action was filed too late [8].

The order of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [8].
