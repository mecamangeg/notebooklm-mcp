I. CAPTION
SAURA IMPORT & EXPORT CO., INC. v. PHILIPPINE INTERNATIONAL SURETY CO., INC. and PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, G.R. No. L-15184, May 31, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Saura Import & Export Co., Inc. mortgaged a parcel of land to respondent Philippine National Bank (PNB). As required by the mortgage contract, Saura insured the building and its contents with respondent Philippine International Surety Co., Inc. for P29,000.00 against fire for one year starting October 2, 1954. The policy was endorsed to PNB as the mortgagee. On October 15, 1954, the insurer cancelled the policy and sent written notice to PNB, which received it on November 8, 1954. However, neither the insurer nor PNB informed Saura of the cancellation. On April 6, 1955, the building burned down. Saura filed a claim, but the insurer refused to pay, citing the cancellation. Saura filed a suit for damages, but the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N notice of cancellation given to the mortgagee alone is effective to cancel the policy as against the insured.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court ruled that in the absence of specific stipulations in the policy or provisions in the Insurance Law (Act No. 2427) regarding the form or period of notice, generally accepted principles of insurance apply. These principles require that actual notice of cancellation be given to the insured in a clear and unequivocal manner, preferably in writing, to afford them an opportunity to obtain other insurance. Notice must be personal to the insured; notice to the mortgagee alone is ineffective as a cancellation of the policy against the owner of the property (*Connecticut Ins. Co. v. Caummisar*). Since the insurer failed to notify Saura, the policy remained in force.

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and Philippine International Surety Co., Inc. is ordered to pay Saura Import & Export Co., Inc. the sum of P29,000.00.
