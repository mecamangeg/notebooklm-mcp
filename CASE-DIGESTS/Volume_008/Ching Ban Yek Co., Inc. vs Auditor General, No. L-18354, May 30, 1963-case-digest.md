**I. CAPTION**
CHING BAN YEK CO., INC. v. AUDITOR GENERAL, G.R. No. L-18354, May 30, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Ching Ban Yek Co., Inc. filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the Supreme Court's decision dated December 29, 1962 [1]. The central issue in the original decision was whether hydrogenated cottonseed oil acts as a "component" or a "stabilizer" in the manufacture of vegetable lard under Republic Act No. 601 [2]. The Court had previously upheld the respondent Auditor General's ruling—based on the opinion of Deputy Commissioner Flaviano M. Yenko of the National Institute of Science and Technology—that hydrogenated cottonseed oil is a component because it does not affect the chemical stability of the oil [2, 3].

In its Motion for Reconsideration, the petitioner submitted "new evidence" effectively disputing the technical opinion relied upon by the Court. This evidence included a certificate from Senate President Eulogio Rodriguez, opinions from the National Science Development Board and an American consultant, and a new citation from Deputy Commissioner Yenko referencing the book "Industrial Oil and Fat Products" by Alton E. Bailey, which suggests a different function for the oil [4-6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the case should be remanded to the Auditor General to consider the new evidence submitted.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court resolved to remand the case to the respondent Auditor General for further action without acting on the Motion for Reconsideration for the present [6, 7].

The Court reasoned that the documents submitted by the petitioner constitute "new evidence" [6]. Because the respondent Auditor General had not been given the opportunity to examine these documents or cross-examine the authors to test their credibility, the Court deemed it proper to remand the proceedings to the respondent for whatever action he may deem proper in light of the new submissions [6].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Bengzon, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal, JJ., concurred. Padilla, Labrador, and Concepcion, JJ., took no part) [7].
