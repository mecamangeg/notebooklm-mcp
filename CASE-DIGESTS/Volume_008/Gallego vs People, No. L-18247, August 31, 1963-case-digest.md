I. CAPTION
FLORENTINO GALLEGO v. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-18247, August 31, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On the morning of March 10, 1957, petitioner Florentino Gallego and his companions were preparing to hold a meeting of the Jehovah's Witnesses in front of the public market of Lambunao, Iloilo. The Chief of Police, Avelino Larrosa, approached Gallego and requested a permit. When Gallego could not produce one, the Chief enjoined him from proceeding. Instead of obeying, Gallego addressed his followers in a challenging manner, stating, "You must continue that, we will see what they can do for us." Despite a warning that he would be arrested, Gallego continued the meeting for at least 30 minutes.

Gallego was charged and convicted by the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo for slight disobedience of an agent of a person in authority and fined P10.00. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the conviction, taking judicial notice of Municipal Ordinance No. 2, Series of 1957, which required a permit for such meetings. Gallego appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the CA's judicial notice of the ordinance and invoking his constitutional right to free assembly.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Appeals erred in taking judicial notice of the municipal ordinance.
2. W/N the enforcement of the ordinance requiring a permit violated the petitioner's constitutional right to free assembly.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that there is nothing in the law prohibiting the Court of Appeals from taking cognizance of a municipal ordinance. Under Section 5 of Rule 123 of the Rules of Court, courts are enjoined to take judicial notice of matters capable of unquestionable demonstration [1]. Furthermore, the Court reiterated the doctrine in *People v. Gebune* that Courts of First Instance should take judicial notice of municipal ordinances within their respective jurisdictions [2]. Therefore, the existence of Ordinance No. 2, Series of 1957, was correctly recognized.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that while the rights to freedom of speech and peaceable assembly are fundamental, they are not absolute. These rights may be regulated under the sovereign **police power** to ensure they are not injurious to the equal enjoyment of others or the community [3]. The ordinance in question is a reasonable regulation of the use of public streets and does not confer arbitrary power to grant or deny a permit [4]. Citing *Primicias v. Fugoso*, the Court affirmed that the petitioner was not justified in disobeying the agent of a person in authority merely because he believed he had a legitimate reason to protest [5, 6].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
