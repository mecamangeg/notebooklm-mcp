I. CAPTION
NARCISA BUENCAMINO, AMADA DE LEON-ERAÑA, ENCARNACION DE LEON and BIENVENIDO B. ERAÑA v. C. HERNANDEZ, as City Treasurer of Quezon City, JAIME HERNANDEZ, as Secretary of Finance and LAND TENURE ADMINISTRATION, G.R. No. L-14883, July 31, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On May 11, 1957, petitioners sold their hacienda to the Land Tenure Administration (LTA) for P2,746,000.00 under Republic Act (RA) No. 1400 [1]. The agreement provided that 50% of the price would be paid in negotiable land certificates [2]. These certificates contained a condition that they could not be encashed until after five years from the execution of the deed of sale, although the deed stipulated they could be used to pay government tax obligations within that five-year period pursuant to Section 10 of RA 1400 [3-5].

Petitioners tendered these certificates to the respondent City Treasurer of Quezon City to pay their 1957 realty taxes. The Treasurer refused to accept them [6]. Consequently, petitioners paid in cash but later tendered the certificates again for their 1958 taxes. The Treasurer again rejected the tender. Petitioners filed a petition for mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon City to compel acceptance [7]. The Treasurer moved to dismiss, arguing the certificates were not issued in accordance with law because they were not "payable on demand" [8, 9]. The CFI dismissed the petition, sustaining the Treasurer's position [10].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent City Treasurer may be compelled to accept the negotiable land certificates as payment for realty taxes.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the petition.

The Court ruled that the respondent Treasurer was legally justified in refusing the certificates because they failed to comply with the requirements of RA 1400 [10]. Section 9 of RA 1400 explicitly mandates that land certificates "shall be payable to bearer on demand" [11]. Under Section 7 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, an instrument is payable on demand only when it is expressed to be so payable on presentation or when it expresses no time for payment. The certificates issued to petitioners were payable only after a lapse of five years, which constitutes a fixed time for payment contrary to the nature of a demand instrument [11].

Petitioners argued that Section 10 of RA 1400 allows the use of certificates for tax payments regardless of the encashment restriction. The Court rejected this, holding that the privileges under Section 10 apply only to certificates issued strictly in accordance with Section 9 (payable on demand). Since the certificates violated Section 9, the benefits of Section 10 could not be invoked [12].

**Order affirmed.**
