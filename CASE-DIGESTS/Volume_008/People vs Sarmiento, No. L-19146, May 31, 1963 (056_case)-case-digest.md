I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PEDRO SARMIENTO, G.R. No. L-19146, May 31, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Pedro Sarmiento was charged with Murder for shooting Baldestamon. Sarmiento admitted the killing but claimed self-defense, alleging the deceased rushed at him with a bolo. The Court of First Instance of Antique rejected the plea of self-defense due to physical evidence but convicted Sarmiento only of Homicide, finding that the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation were not proven. Sarmiento appealed to the Court of Appeals. The CA agreed that self-defense was not established but opined that the crime was Murder due to the presence of evident premeditation. Consequently, the CA certified the case to the Supreme Court for final determination as the penalty would be *reclusion perpetua*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Sarmiento acted in self-defense.
2. W/N the killing was qualified by treachery or evident premeditation to constitute Murder.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The physical evidence contradicts the claim of aggression. The victim was shot from a distance of 24 meters, and while the hilt of the victim's bolo was hit by a bullet, his hands were completely unwounded, indicating he was not wielding the weapon at the time of the shooting [1, 2].

2. **NO.** Neither circumstance was established beyond reasonable doubt.
   *   **As to Treachery:** The mere fact that the victim was shot from the left side or from a distance does not suffice. Treachery exists only when the offender employs means directly and specially to ensure execution without risk to himself (Art. 14, par. 16, Revised Penal Code) [3].
   *   **As to Evident Premeditation:** Mere threats to kill made days before ("I will shoot you tomorrow") are insufficient. Evident premeditation requires proof that the accused deliberately planned the crime and persisted in it after "cold and deep meditation" (People v. Gonzales). There was no evidence Sarmiento planned the encounter; the victim appeared unexpectedly while Sarmiento was plowing [4, 5].

The decision of the trial court convicting the accused of Homicide is AFFIRMED.
