I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GUILLERMO CAPADOCIA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-4907, June 29, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Appellants Flavio Nava, Nicolas B. Centeno, and William D. Regalado were charged with rebellion and the complex crime of rebellion with multiple murder and arson. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo convicted Nava and Centeno of the complex crime, sentencing them to life imprisonment, and convicted Regalado of simple rebellion. The prosecution alleged that Regalado sold ammunition to a Huk courier named "Cherry" for P210.00. Against Centeno, witnesses claimed he organized for the HMB (Hukbalahap), though evidence showed he was threatened by Huks to provide aid and had previously expelled a Huk leader from his labor union. Against Nava, witnesses identified him as a Huk commander, but he presented alibis corroborated by medical records of chronic asthma and documentary evidence of his presence in other cities during the alleged crimes. The prosecution witnesses were primarily political detainees.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the act of selling ammunition to Huks constitutes the crime of rebellion.
2. W/N the guilt of the appellants was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the act of selling ammunition to the Huks is not punishable under the laws on rebellion [1, 2]. Even if the prosecution's evidence were true, Regalado’s demand for monetary payment for the ammunition suggests he was not a member of the Huk movement. While such an act might constitute a crime if committed in relation to treason under Art. 116 of the Revised Penal Code, it does not legally constitute rebellion [3].

2. **NO.** The Court found the evidence insufficient to convict the appellants.
   For **Regalado**, his demand for payment and the message sent to the Huk commander to send more money if more ammunition was needed negated the theory that he was a Huk member [4].
   For **Centeno**, the fact that he had to be intimidated ("trigger men would be sent") to secure his assistance proves a lack of cooperation with the rebellion [5, 6]. Furthermore, his act of expelling a Huk leader from his labor federation for expressing views contrary to the Republic negates the theory of his membership [7, 8].
   For **Nava**, his alibi was substantiated by medical records proving he suffered from chronic asthma, making life in Huk camps impossible [9]. The Court ruled that the general rule favoring positive over negative testimony does not apply when prosecution witnesses are political detainees whose fate depends on government favor [10, 11].
   
   The decision of the lower court is **REVERSED** and the case **DISMISSED** [12, 13].
