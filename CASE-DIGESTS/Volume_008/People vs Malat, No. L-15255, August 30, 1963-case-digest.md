I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. YAKAN MALAT, G.R. No. L-15255, August 30, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On August 8, 1958, at around 7:30 p.m. in Basilan City, Imam Djaliol was shot and killed while inside his house with his wife, Mora Sabdia, and their child [1]. Immediately after the shots were fired, Sabdia shined a flashlight outside the window and positively identified the accused, Yakan Malat, and his brother, Yakan Garcia, standing about five meters away armed with guns [1]. Sabdia immediately informed the victim's sister, Nuhaila, and later the police, that Malat and Garcia were the perpetrators [2, 3]. Another witness, Asamudin Naruddin, testified that he met the accused armed with guns near the scene of the crime shortly after hearing the shots [4, 5]. The accused raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was fishing at sea during the incident [5]. The Court of First Instance of Basilan City convicted Malat of murder and sentenced him to *reclusión perpetua*, while his co-accused brother was killed in a separate encounter [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused's defense of alibi can prevail over the positive identification by the prosecution witnesses.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused by the witnesses [7]. The Court gave credence to the testimony of the widow, Sabdia, who identified the accused spontaneously and without hesitation immediately after the shooting to the victim's sister and subsequently to the police investigator [7]. This positive identification was further corroborated by the testimony of Naruddin, who saw the accused armed near the crime scene, and by the established motive regarding a land dispute between the accused and a relative of the deceased [7]. The trial court's assessment of credibility was upheld, and the decision convicting the appellant was affirmed [8].
