I. CAPTION
MARIA VDA. DE SOTTO v. HON. ANDRES REYES, Judge of Court of First Instance of Rizal, A. S. BUSTOS and PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF RIZAL, G.R. No. L-18439, August 21, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Maria Vda. de Sotto filed a complaint against Spouses Flores and Leonor Gutierrez to annul a deed of sale and a subsequent mortgage on her land, alleging the spouses fraudulently secured her title and mortgaged the property to Gutierrez [1, 2]. The parties eventually entered into a compromise agreement, stipulating that the land would be reconveyed to Petitioner subject to the mortgage in favor of Gutierrez should the secured debt remain unpaid [3, 4]. The trial court rendered judgment based on this compromise, which subsequently became final [4].

Later, Petitioner moved to suspend the order of execution and reopen the case, claiming she discovered that the mortgagee, Leonor Gutierrez, was a fictitious and inexistent person, thereby rendering the mortgage void [5, 6]. The Respondent Judge denied the motion to reopen [5]. Petitioner filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition, alleging grave abuse of discretion [1, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to reopen the case to determine the existence of the mortgagee after the judgment based on compromise had become final.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that having consented to the compromise agreement which expressly provided that the reconveyance of the land was subject to the mortgage in favor of Gutierrez, the Petitioner cannot subsequently complain if the court enforces said compromise [3, 4]. The issue of the existence or inexistence of the mortgagee cannot be threshed out anew in the same case where the judgment on the compromise has already become final [4]. Consequently, the Respondent Judge's refusal to reopen the case to determine if the mortgagee was real or fictitious did not constitute grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction [3, 4].

The Writ is denied and the preliminary injunction is discharged [7].
