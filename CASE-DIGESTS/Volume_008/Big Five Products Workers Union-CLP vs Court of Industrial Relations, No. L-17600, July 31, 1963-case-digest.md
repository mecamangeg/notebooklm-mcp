I. CAPTION
BIG FIVE PRODUCTS WORKERS UNION-CLP v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, BIG FIVE PRODUCTS and/or PAULA RICARO, G.R. No. L-17600, July 31, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Union’s officers were dismissed by respondent Paula Ricaro, manager of Big Five Products, shortly after organizing the union [1, 2]. Another employee, Perlito Palomata, was dismissed for testifying in the case despite Ricaro's threats [2]. The remaining union members were evicted from the premises and their work days were reduced compared to non-union workers [3].

The trial judge dismissed the initial complaint, but the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) *en banc* reversed this, finding the respondents guilty of unfair labor practices (ULP) with "malice aforethought" for dismissing employees due to union activities and testifying [4, 5]. However, the CIR ordered reinstatement *without* backpay [6]. The Union appealed, arguing that since the ULP was proven, backpay should be awarded [7]. Respondents contended that the CIR has discretion under Republic Act No. 875 to order reinstatement "with or without backpay" [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the employees dismissed due to unfair labor practices committed with malice are entitled to reinstatement with full backpay.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Although Section 5(c) of Republic Act No. 875 empowers the CIR to order reinstatement "with or without backpay," this discretion must be exercised according to justice, reason, and equity [5]. The Supreme Court distinguished this case from previous rulings where backpay was denied; in those cases, the employers acted in *good faith* (e.g., erroneously believing a closed-shop provision applied to all) [9].

Here, the CIR explicitly found the respondents guilty of ULP with "malice aforethought," having dismissed employees specifically for union activities and testifying [5]. Under such conditions, reinstatement with full backpay is necessary to assure the freedom of laborers to engage in union activities [10, 11]. Full backpay is defined as the compensation the employees would have received had no discrimination occurred, minus any earnings from other employment during the dismissal period [12].

The resolution appealed from is **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**, ordering the reinstatement to be with full backpay.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred [13].
