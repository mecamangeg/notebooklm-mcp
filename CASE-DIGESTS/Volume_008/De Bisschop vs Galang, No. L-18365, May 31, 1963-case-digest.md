I. CAPTION
GEORGE DE BISSCHOP v. EMILIO L. GALANG, in his capacity as Commissioner of Immigration, G.R. No. L-18365, May 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner George de Bisschop, an American citizen and president of Bissmag Production, Inc., was allowed to stay in the Philippines as a prearranged employee until August 1, 1959 [1]. On July 10, 1959, he applied for an extension of stay [1]. However, due to confidential reports that his company was a "gambling front" and that he was suspected of tax evasion, the Board of Commissioners denied his application [1, 2]. The Commissioner of Immigration advised him to depart within five days [2]. When petitioner’s counsel requested a copy of the decision, the Bureau’s legal officer replied that, for reasons of practicability and expediency, no formal decision or resolution is promulgated in such cases; the denial was merely based on the votes of the majority members [2, 3]. To forestall his arrest and deportation, petitioner filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [3]. The CFI granted the petition, enjoining the Commissioner from arresting petitioner until proper proceedings were conducted [4]. Respondent Commissioner appealed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Commissioners of Immigration are required to conduct formal hearings on applications for extension of stay.
2. W/N the Board of Commissioners must promulgate written decisions in cases of extension of stay.
3. W/N the writ of prohibition is the proper remedy to contest the denial of the extension.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The administration of immigration laws is the primary responsibility of the Executive branch, and the extension of an alien's stay is purely discretionary [5]. Commonwealth Act No. 613 (Philippine Immigration Act of 1940) is silent on the procedure for extensions [5, 6]. Consequently, courts have no jurisdiction to review the purely administrative practice of denying formal hearings for reasons of expediency [5, 6]. The lack of a hearing does not violate due process because a day in court is not a matter of right in administrative proceedings, unlike in judicial proceedings [5-7]. The notice to depart was merely a preliminary step, not a final deprivation of right [5].

2. **NO.** While Section 8 of the Immigration Act mentions "decision," this refers to the number of votes necessary to constitute the Board's action, not a written judgment [8]. The law specifically enumerates when written decisions are required (e.g., appeals from the Board of Special Inquiry or deportation cases under Section 37), but it does not require written decisions for petitions for extension of stay [8].

3. **NO.** Prohibition is not favored and should issue only in cases of extreme necessity where there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy [9, 10]. The settled practice is to use the writ of *habeas corpus* to test the legality of an alien’s confinement and proposed expulsion [9-11]. The existence of the adequate remedy of *habeas corpus* bars the issuance of a writ of prohibition [9, 12].

The order appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the petition for prohibition is **DISMISSED** [13].
