I. CAPTION
**J. M. TUASON & Co., INC., represented by its Managing Partner, the Gregorio Araneta, Inc. v. DANNY VIBAT**, G.R. No. L-18884, May 29, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On January 7, 1959, J. M. Tuason & Co., Inc. filed an *accion publiciana* for ejectment and collection of rentals against Danny Vibat in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal [1]. The plaintiff alleged ownership of a parcel of land in Quezon City covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1267 and claimed Vibat entered the property through force and stealth in June 1950 [1, 2]. Summons was served on April 13, 1959, to one Candido Calon [3].

Vibat failed to answer and was declared in default on May 16, 1959 [3]. The CFI rendered judgment in favor of Tuason on June 3, 1959 [3]. On June 23, 1959, Vibat filed a petition for relief from judgment, alleging excusable negligence. He claimed Calon was merely a visitor and that he (Vibat) only received the summons "several days" after returning from Laguna on May 10, 1959 [4]. He asserted a meritorious defense of having purchased the land from one Eustaquio Alquiros [4, 5]. The CFI denied the petition for lack of merit and diligence [6]. Vibat appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved questions of law [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for relief from judgment should be granted based on excusable negligence.
2. W/N the defendant has a meritorious defense of ownership via purchase and adverse possession against a Torrens title.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court found the appellant did not act with due diligence. Vibat admitted receiving the summons from Calon "several days" after May 10, 1959 [7]. Since the order of default was issued on May 16 and the judgment rendered on June 3, Vibat had sufficient time to inquire and ask for the lifting of the default order before the judgment was rendered had he acted promptly [7].

2. **NO.** The appellant has no meritorious defense. His claim of purchasing the land from Alquiros cannot prevail against the plaintiff's Torrens title [8]. A Torrens title concludes all controversy over ownership of the land covered by the final decree of registration [8]. Furthermore, under Section 46 of Act 496, title by adverse possession cannot be acquired against a registered owner [8, 9]. The appellant's remedy lies only against his immediate vendor for warranty against eviction [8].

The order denying the petition for relief is affirmed [10].
