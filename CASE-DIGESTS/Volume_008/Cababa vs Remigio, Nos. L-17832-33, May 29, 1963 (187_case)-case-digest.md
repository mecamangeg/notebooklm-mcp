I. CAPTION
ALFONSO CABABA v. BALBINO REMIGIO and PONCIANO CARILLO, G.R. Nos. L-17832-33, May 29, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Remigio and Carillo filed separate applications with the Public Service Commission (PSC) to operate ferry services across the Cagayan River to serve as a continuation of the Cagayan-Ilocos national highway [1], [2]. Petitioner Cababa, an existing CPC holder operating a ferry service in the same area, opposed the applications on the grounds that the respondents were not financially capable, there was no need for additional services, and that he should be given preference as the prior operator [3]. The PSC granted the respondents certificates to operate one motorboat each, citing the inadequacy of the present service, the practice of overcharging during storms, and the risk that Cababa—who also operated TPU trucks—might discriminate against passengers of rival TPU operators [4], [5]. Cababa appealed the joint decision [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondents are financially capable of operating the ferry services.
2. W/N the grant of additional certificates of public convenience is in the public interest.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the respondents were financially capable. The mere fact that Remigio had previously sold a certificate for a TPU service, or that Carillo had allowed the foreclosure of a TPU truck because it was defective and expensive to maintain, does not imply that they are not in sound financial condition [6], [7]. Both respondents proved ownership of significant assets, including ricelands, houses, and other public utility vehicles [8].

2. **YES.** The ultimate test for granting a certificate to operate additional services is whether the grant is for the best interest of the public [9], [10]. The Court affirmed the PSC's finding that competition was necessary to prevent discrimination and improve service, noting the Provincial Board's resolution regarding the inadequacy of the existing ferry and "onerous practice of overcharging" [4], [5]. While an established operator is generally protected in their investment, public interest and convenience must take precedence over the "prior operator" rule [5].

The decision of the Public Service Commission is **AFFIRMED** [11].
