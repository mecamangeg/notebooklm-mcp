**I. CAPTION**
ROMAN TOLEDO, ET AL. v. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16054, July 31, 1963, 8 SCRA 499, Padilla, J.

**II. FACTS**
Jose Rongo filed actions in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) against Roman Toledo and others regarding tenancy shares and ejectment on Lots No. 743 and 748 in Negros Occidental. Rongo alleged that Toledo and his cohorts forcibly entered the land, thereby dispossessing Rongo’s tenants. Conversely, Toledo and his group claimed to be tenants of Toledo, whom they asserted was the owner. Toledo argued that the CAR lacked jurisdiction because the issues of ownership and possession were already pending in ordinary courts via a civil case (No. 3801) and a forcible entry case (No. 3564).

The CAR assumed jurisdiction, reasoning that the cases involved tenancy disputes. It rendered judgment declaring Rongo and intervenor Felix Amante as the lawful landholders, ordering Toledo’s group to vacate, and dismissing Toledo's complaints for lack of tenancy relationship. Toledo appealed, contending the CAR erred in deciding the matter while the ownership and forcible entry cases were *sub judice* in regular courts.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction over tenancy disputes involving dispossession by third parties despite pending ownership and forcible entry cases in ordinary courts.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CAR's jurisdiction. Under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 1199 and Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1267 (as amended by R.A. No. 1409), the CAR is vested with original and exclusive jurisdiction to settle all controversies involving relationships established by law, which includes the dispossession of tenanted agricultural land committed by third parties.

The Court held that the CAR is the only court that can take cognizance of tenancy cases, "regardless of the fact that there is an action of forcible entry brought involving controversy on possession of the land subject of the action." The CAR did not pass upon the issue of ownership (title), which is beyond its competence, but correctly limited itself to determining the legal possession of the land to ascertain who the lawful landholder was for tenancy purposes.

The petition was denied and the judgment appealed from was **AFFIRMED**.
