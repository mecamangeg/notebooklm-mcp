I. CAPTION
**BASILIO S. FALCON, deceased, substituted by his wife LOURDES BURGOS and children ARNULFO, FE, SILVESTRE, EMILIO, and BLANQUITA FALCON v. HON. FRANCISCO ARCA, in his capacity as Presiding Judge of the Court of First Instance of Laguna, Second Branch, and ROBERTO FALCON**, G.R. No. L-18135, July 31, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Roberto Falcon filed an action for support against Basilio S. Falcon in the Court of First Instance of Laguna, claiming to be Basilio's illegitimate child [1]. The Court of Appeals (CA) declared Roberto an illegitimate son and ordered Basilio to pay him P50.00 monthly "until he reaches the age of majority or completes a profession or trade" [2]. Basilio paid support until Roberto reached the age of majority on December 27, 1960, then stopped [1, 3]. Roberto petitioned the trial court to order continued support for his education/training [3]. Judge Arca issued an order on February 17, 1961, directing Basilio to continue the payments [3]. Basilio filed this petition for certiorari, arguing the CA judgment extinguished his obligation upon Roberto reaching majority [4]. During the pendency of the petition, Basilio died on August 2, 1961 [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court correctly ordered the continuation of support beyond the recipient's age of majority.
2. W/N the obligation to support continues after the death of the obligor.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the CA intended to grant support in accordance with the law [6]. Under **Article 290 of the Civil Code**, support includes education or training for a profession, trade, or vocation, *even beyond the age of majority* [7]. Therefore, the trial court acted within its jurisdiction in ordering the continuation of support for Roberto's education despite him reaching the age of majority [6].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the obligation to furnish support ceases upon the death of the obligor, even if he may be bound to give it in compliance with a final judgment, pursuant to **Article 300 of the Civil Code** [5]. Consequently, Basilio's obligation to support Roberto ceased upon his death on August 2, 1961, and the trial court must consider this circumstance in enforcing the order [5].

Petition for certiorari is **DENIED** [8].
