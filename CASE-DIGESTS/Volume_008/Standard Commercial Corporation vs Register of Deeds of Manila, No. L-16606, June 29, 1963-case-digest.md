I. CAPTION
STANDARD COMMERCIAL CORPORATION v. REGISTER OF DEEDS OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-16606, June 29, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On October 24, 1957, petitioner Standard Commercial Corporation executed a real estate mortgage over two parcels of land in favor of the Philippine Bank of Commerce to guarantee the P1,500,000.00 obligation of its sister corporation, Consolidated Philippines, Inc. [1]. Subsequently, on June 23, 1959, petitioner executed an "Amendment to Real Estate Mortgage" in favor of the same bank to secure the P1,900,000.00 obligation of another sister corporation, Standard Investment Corporation [2]. The amendment provided that the obligation under the original mortgage was cancelled and the properties, with one additional parcel, were given as security for the obligation of the second sister corporation [2].

When the deed was presented for registration, the respondent Register of Deeds of Manila required petitioner to pay registration fees and documentary stamps based on the full amount of P1,900,000.00 [3]. Petitioner refused, arguing that fees should be computed only on the P400,000.00 difference between the old and new obligations [3]. The Land Registration Commission sustained the Register of Deeds [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the "Amendment to Real Estate Mortgage" constitutes a new contract requiring the payment of registration fees and documentary stamps based on the full amount of the new obligation.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the second mortgage must be deemed an entirely new contract [4]. The text of the second deed showed that the prior mortgage of October 24, 1957, was deemed cancelled because the specific obligation it secured had been cancelled by the parties [4]. Furthermore, the new obligation secured by the subsequent mortgage was not only for a different and larger amount, but was also the obligation of an entirely different party, Standard Investment Corporation [4]. Therefore, for its registration, the party concerned must pay the corresponding registration fees and attach the appropriate documentary stamps based on the full amount of the new contract [4].

The resolution appealed from is affirmed [5].
