I. CAPTION
ELAINE A. MOORE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18407, June 26, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Elaine A. Moore, an American citizen, was formerly married to Joseph P. Velarde, with whom she had a legitimate child named William Michael Velarde, born in 1947 [1]. Following a divorce from Velarde, Petitioner married a second husband. She filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Rizal to change the name of her 14-year-old son to "William Michael Velarde Moore" so that he could bear the surname of his stepfather [2, 3]. The trial court denied the petition, ruling that the child must retain the surname of his natural father [1]. Petitioner appealed the denial to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a legitimate minor child may be permitted to adopt the surname of the mother's second husband.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that Philippine laws do not authorize a legitimate child to use the surname of a person who is not his father [4, 5]. **Article 364 of the Civil Code** specifically provides that legitimate children shall principally use the surname of their father [6]. Additionally, the Court applied **Article 369 of the Civil Code** by analogy, reasoning that just as children conceived before the annulment of a voidable marriage must use the father's surname, children conceived before a divorce decree must also carry the surname of the real father [6].

The Court held that allowing the change would cause confusion regarding the child's paternity and could eventually prejudice the child within the community [3, 7]. Furthermore, the petition was deemed premature because the child was still a minor; the Court reasoned that he should be allowed to decide the matter for himself upon reaching the age of maturity [7, 8].

The order of the lower court is affirmed [8].
