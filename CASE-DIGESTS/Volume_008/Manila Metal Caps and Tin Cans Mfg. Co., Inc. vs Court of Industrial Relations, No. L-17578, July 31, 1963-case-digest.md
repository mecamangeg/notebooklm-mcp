I. CAPTION
MANILA METAL CAPS AND TIN CANS MANUFACTURING COMPANY, INCORPORATED v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and MANILA METAL CAPS AND TIN CANS LABOR UNION (PAFLU), G.R. No. L-17578, July 31, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On September 23, 1957, respondent Union filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice against petitioner Company, alleging the dismissal of 13 employees, including Union President Fred Cordero, due to their union affiliation [1]. The Company denied that the claimants were ever employees, asserting their names did not appear in the payrolls [2], [3].

The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) rendered a judgment ordering the reinstatement of two claimants, Emilio Necio and Fructuoso Pesic, with back wages, finding they were employees illegally dismissed for union activities [4]. The Company filed a Motion for Reconsideration and subsequently a "Motion for Extension of Time to File Memorandum," which was denied under the CIR's "no extension policy" [5]. The memorandum was filed late. The CIR *en banc* denied the Motion for Reconsideration, stating the arguments lacked merit and noting the late filing of the memorandum [5]. The Company petitioned for review, arguing the late memorandum should not justify dismissal and challenging the factual findings [6].

III. ISSUES
1. W/N the CIR validly dismissed the Motion for Reconsideration.
2. W/N the CIR's factual finding that Necio and Pesic were employees is supported by substantial evidence.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The dismissal was proper. First, the CIR *en banc* denied the motion primarily because the arguments contained in the motion itself were not deemed meritorious after perusal of the evidence, regardless of the late memorandum [6], [7]. Second, the "no-extension policy" regarding motions for reconsideration and supporting memoranda under Sections 15, 16, and 17 of the CIR Rules must be observed; failure to comply warrants dismissal (*Luzon Stevedoring v. CIR*; *Bien v. Castillo*) [8].

2. **YES.** The Court found substantial evidence supporting the CIR's decision. The record showed Necio and Pesic were employed and made to sign payrolls, which the Company failed to produce despite claiming they didn't exist [9]. The Court gave credence to the workers' specific descriptions of their duties (e.g., cutting wires, spray painting) over the Company's denials [10]. As long as there is evidence to support a decision of the Industrial Court, it may not be revoked merely because it is not based on overwhelming or preponderant evidence (*Phil. Newspaper Guild v. Evening News, Inc.*) [10].

The writ is denied; judgment affirmed [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
