I. CAPTION
VALENTINA ROSARIO, et al. v. JUANA ALONZO, et al., G.R. No. L-17330, June 29, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs filed an action for partition, accounting, and damages against defendants regarding two parcels of land in Ilocos Sur [1]. Defendants filed an answer claiming ownership through purchase and homestead occupation [2]. On the scheduled hearing date of March 18, 1955, defendants and their counsel failed to appear [3]. The trial court allowed plaintiffs to present evidence and subsequently rendered judgment in their favor [3]. Defendants filed a motion for reconsideration and later a motion to set aside the judgment, arguing their counsel's failure to appear was due to forgetfulness and oversight [3, 4]. The trial court denied the motions because no affidavit of merit was attached [3]. Defendants appealed, claiming the court erred in refusing to lift the "order of default" and set aside the judgment [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in denying the motion to set aside the judgment due to the absence of an affidavit of merit.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the order of the lower court [6]. First, the Court clarified that having answered the complaint, the defendants "were not and could not be in default" [4]. However, regarding the refusal to set aside the judgment, the Court ruled that the motions were defective. Under Section 3, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court, a motion for reconsideration or to set aside a judgment must be "accompanied with affidavits showing the fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence relied upon, and the facts constituting the petitioner's good and substantial cause of action or defense" [4]. Although the motions were sworn to by the attorney, they lacked the required affidavits of merit, making the denial proper [4]. The order appealed from is affirmed [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
