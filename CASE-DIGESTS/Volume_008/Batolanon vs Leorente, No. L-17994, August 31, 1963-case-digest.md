I. CAPTION
FEDERICO BATOLANON and TEODORO V. NANO v. HON. ROMAN A. LEORENTE, Justice of the Peace of Tagum, Davao, G.R. No. L-17994, August 31, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On September 13, 1956, petitioner Federico Batolanon sent a letter to his former counsel, Atty. Irineo D. Benavides, refusing to pay legal fees. Instead, Batolanon demanded P1,000.00 and an apology from Benavides for alleged fraud and fabrication of cases, threatening to file disbarment proceedings against the lawyer if the demand was not met within 10 days [1-5]. On December 10, 1956, a complaint for light threats under Article 283 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) was filed against Batolanon, and later amended to include his lawyer, petitioner Teodoro V. Nano [6]. Petitioners moved to quash, arguing that because the purpose of the threat (extortion) was not attained, the penalty should be lowered by two degrees to *arresto menor* (pursuant to Article 282), which prescribes in two months. They claimed the crime had prescribed since the complaint was filed nearly three months after the threat [7]. The Justice of the Peace and the Court of First Instance of Davao denied the motion, ruling the crime had not prescribed [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the threat to file disbarment proceedings to extort money constitutes light threats.
2. W/N the crime charged has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A threat to file disbarment proceedings by a client against his attorney unless given P1,000 constitutes light threats punishable under Article 283 of the Revised Penal Code [9, 10].

2. **NO.** The crime has not prescribed. The Court rejected the petitioners' contention that the penalty should be reduced to *arresto menor* because the purpose of the threat was not attained. The reference in Article 283 to Article 282 of the RPC is confined only to the *manner* of committing the threat (i.e., demanding money or imposing conditions), without changing or altering the penalty Article 283 imposes. The offense of light threat—threatening to commit a wrong not constituting a crime—is specifically punishable by *arresto mayor* under Article 283 [11, 12]. Crimes punishable by *arresto mayor* prescribe in five years [11]. Since the threat was made on September 13, 1956, and the complaint was filed on December 10, 1956, it was filed well within the prescriptive period [11].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [13].
