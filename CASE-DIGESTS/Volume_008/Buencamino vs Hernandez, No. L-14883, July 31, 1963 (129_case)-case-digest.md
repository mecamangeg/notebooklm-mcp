I. CAPTION
NARCISA BUENCAMINO, et al. v. C. HERNANDEZ, as City Treasurer of Quezon City, et al., G.R. No. L-14883, July 31, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On May 11, 1957, petitioners sold their hacienda to the Land Tenure Administration (LTA) under Republic Act No. 1400 (Land Reform Act of 1955) for P2,746,000.00. The agreement stipulated that 50% of the price would be paid in "negotiable land certificates" [1, 2]. While the certificates stated they were "payable to bearer on demand," they contained a condition that encashment could not be made until after five years from the deed of sale's execution [3, 4]. However, the deed allowed the vendors to use the certificates to pay land taxes or government obligations within that five-year period [5].

Petitioners tendered the certificates to respondent City Treasurer of Quezon City to pay their 1957 and 1958 realty taxes [6, 7]. The Treasurer refused to accept them, claiming discretion [6]. Petitioners filed a petition for mandamus to compel acceptance. The lower court dismissed the petition, ruling that the certificates did not comply with the legal requirement of being payable on demand [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent City Treasurer may be compelled to accept the negotiable land certificates as payment for realty taxes.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The refusal of the respondent Treasurer was legally justified because the certificates failed to comply with the requirements of Republic Act No. 1400 [9].

Section 9 of RA 1400 mandates that land certificates "shall be payable to bearer on demand" [10]. Under Section 7 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, an instrument is payable on demand only when it is expressed to be so, or when no time for payment is expressed [10]. Here, the five-year restriction on encashment constituted a specific time for payment, meaning they were not truly payable on demand [10].

Although Section 10 of RA 1400 allows holders to use negotiable land certificates to pay tax obligations, this privilege applies only to certificates issued strictly in accordance with Section 9 (i.e., those payable on demand) [11]. Since the certificates held by petitioners did not meet the statutory requirement of being payable on demand, they could not invoke the benefits of Section 10 [11].

The order of the lower court dismissing the petition is affirmed [12].
