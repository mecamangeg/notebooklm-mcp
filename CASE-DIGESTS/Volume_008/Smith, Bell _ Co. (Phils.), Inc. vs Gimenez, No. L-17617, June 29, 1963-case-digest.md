I. CAPTION
SMITH BELL AND CO. (PHILS.), INC. v. HON. PEDRO M. GIMENEZ, as Auditor General, G.R. No. L-17617, June 29, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
The Municipality of Paniqui, Tarlac, through the Bureau of Supply Coordination, purchased a typewriter from petitioner Smith, Bell & Co. for P820.00, with terms F.O.B. Manila. The carrier delivered the typewriter to the municipal building on a Saturday afternoon. Because the Municipal Treasurer (the designated consignee) was absent, a policeman received the unit, witnessed by the Mayor who ordered it taken to his office. Ten days later, a fire completely razed the municipal building, destroying the typewriter. The Municipality sought condonation of the debt, which petitioner refused. The Respondent Auditor General denied the claim for payment, ruling that ownership did not pass to the Municipality because delivery was not made to the consignee as required by the bill of lading, and the equipment was not presented for General Auditing Office (GAO) inspection.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipality of Paniqui is liable for the price of the typewriter despite the alleged defects in delivery and inspection.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court found unquestionable proof of actual delivery through the carrier's records, testimonies of the receiving policeman and the Mayor, and the physical debris found after the fire [1, 2]. While the bill of lading stipulated delivery to the consignee, any misdelivery was the fault of the carrier—which was selected by the government's Bureau of Supply Coordination—and cannot be attributed to the petitioner [1]. Regarding the lack of inspection, the Court ruled that the contract clause requiring it was obsolete; GAO Circular No. 45 (1957) dispensed with GAO inspection for orders of P2,000.00 or less [3]. Finally, the Municipality's retention and use of the typewriter for 10 days constituted implied acceptance under Article 1585 of the New Civil Code [4].

The decision of the Auditor General is reversed.
