I. CAPTION
LUZON BROKERAGE COMPANY v. LUZON LABOR UNION, G.R. No. L-17085, July 31, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
The Supreme Court previously rendered a decision in this case ruling that affidavits are admissible as evidence before the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) because the CIR is an administrative body. Petitioner Luzon Brokerage Company filed a Motion for Reconsideration, objecting to certain monetary claims awarded based on these affidavits [1]. The petitioner argued that specific claims were invalid or duplicated [1]. The Court proceeded to examine the affidavits supporting the objected claims to verify their validity [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court may review the substance of affidavits admitted by the CIR to determine if they justify the claims awarded.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that while an affidavit is admissible as evidence before the Court of Industrial Relations because it is an administrative body, this view does not prevent the Supreme Court from reviewing the affidavit itself to determine whether it justifies a claim for back wages [1, 2].

Upon review of the affidavits, the Court found that certain claimants were listed twice in the CIR order and that a specific claim for P5,250.00 (covering March 1942 to January 1945) was invalid because the services were not rendered in Bataan in connection with the manager's order [1, 3].

Accordingly, the previous decision was **AMENDED**. The petition for certiorari was denied, except that the duplicate and invalid claims were disallowed [3, 4].
