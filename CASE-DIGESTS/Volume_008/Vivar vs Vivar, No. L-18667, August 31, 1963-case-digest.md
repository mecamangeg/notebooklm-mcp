I. CAPTION
ANDRES VIVAR v. ANTONIO VIVAR, G.R. No. L-18667, August 31, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On January 12, 1959, Andres Vivar (plaintiff) filed an action for forcible entry against Antonio Vivar (defendant) in the Justice of the Peace Court of Julita, Leyte. Andres alleged he was the lawful possessor of a land parcel which Antonio entered by stealth and force in May 1958 to build a house.

In his answer, Antonio claimed he was a tenant succeeding his late father and raised the issue that the case fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations. He also filed a counterclaim for over P10,000.00. The Justice of the Peace Court ruled in favor of Andres, ordering Antonio to vacate. On appeal, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte dismissed the case, ruling that the issues raised were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Agrarian Court. The CFI also held that Andres, by moving to dismiss the counterclaim based on tenancy arguments, impliedly admitted the tenancy issue. Andres appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Justice of the Peace Court loses jurisdiction over a forcible entry case when the defendant raises a tenancy issue in the answer.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the nature of an action is determined by the allegations in the complaint, which in this case clearly made out a simple case of forcible entry [1]. The Court reiterated the well-settled rule that a defendant cannot divest the Justice of the Peace Court of jurisdiction simply by raising claims of ownership or tenancy in the answer [1]. The jurisdiction remains unless the questions of possession and ownership (or tenancy) are so inextricably linked that possession cannot be decided without resolving the latter.

Furthermore, the Court ruled that the plaintiff’s motion to dismiss the counterclaim was not an admission of tenancy but merely an argument that the lower court lacked jurisdiction over the counterclaim due to the subject matter and the amount involved (exceeding P5,000) [2, 3].

The Order of dismissal was **SET ASIDE** regarding the complaint, and the case was **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [4].
