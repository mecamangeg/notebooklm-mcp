**I. CAPTION**
RODRIGO COLOSO v. DOMINGO DE JESUS, as Administrator of the Intestate Estate of the deceased Florentina N. Vda. de Jesus, LILIA DE JESUS-SEVILLA and HERMAN SEVILLA, G.R. No. L-16411, August 31, 1963, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 12, 1955, Florentina N. Vda. de Jesus and petitioner Rodrigo Coloso entered into a management agreement regarding a 315-hectare parcel of land in Samal, Bataan [1]. Coloso was granted the power to introduce improvements and an option to purchase the property [1, 2]. In 1956, following a petition by workers on the land, the Land Tenure Administration (LTA) assessed the property for potential acquisition [3]. During negotiations, the LTA appraised the value at P700 per hectare. Coloso was willing to sell at a reduced price of P770 per hectare, but Lilia de Jesus-Sevilla (an heir of the deceased owner) insisted on a price of P2,000 per hectare and questioned Coloso's rights [4]. The sale to the LTA did not materialize.

Coloso filed an action for damages totaling P261,050 against the estate and heirs, alleging that Lilia’s obstruction prevented the perfection of the agreement [5]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the claim for damages but ordered the defendants to execute a deed of sale in favor of Coloso for P60,000, upholding his option to buy [2, 6]. Coloso appealed the dismissal of his claim for damages to the Supreme Court [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Coloso is entitled to damages for the failure of the negotiation with the Land Tenure Administration due to the owner's refusal to agree to the offered price.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. The Court held that a lessee with an option to purchase who has not yet exercised said right by depositing the fixed price possesses only an inchoate right to the land [7, 8]. Coloso had not yet become the owner; thus, his interest was not absolute [8].

Lilia de Jesus-Sevilla, as the owner, was within her rights to reject the LTA's evaluation and demand her own price of P2,000 [8, 9]. Consequently, her refusal to agree to the lower price of P700—even if Coloso had agreed to it—was a valid exercise of ownership rights and cannot be deemed to have caused legal injury to Coloso (*damnum absque injuria*) [7, 9]. Furthermore, the negotiations were merely preliminary, and there was no proof of a formal offer by the LTA to purchase the land at P700 per hectare, nor sufficient proof that Lilia's refusal was the proximate cause of the negotiation's failure [10, 11].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [12].
