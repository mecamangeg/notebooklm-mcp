I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DOLORES COQUIA, G.R. No. L-16456, June 29, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On July 1, 1957, an incident occurred which led David C. Naval to file a complaint for grave oral defamation against Dolores Coquia in the Municipal Court of Naga. On July 22, 1957, the Municipal Court forwarded the records to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Sur after the accused renounced her right to the second stage of preliminary investigation. On August 2, 1957, the CFI endorsed the case to the Office of the City Attorney for reinformation. The City Fiscal left the case unacted upon until January 26, 1959, when he finally filed the information for grave oral defamation with the CFI. Coquia filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground of prescription, which the lower court granted. The Solicitor General appealed, conceding the delay but seeking clarification on the interruption of prescriptive periods under Article 91 of the Revised Penal Code.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the crime of grave oral defamation has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the crime had prescribed. Under Article 90 of the Revised Penal Code, grave oral defamation prescribes in six months. Article 91 states that the prescriptive period is interrupted by the filing of the complaint or information. Relying on the doctrine in *People v. Del Rosario* (G.R. No. L-15140) and *People v. Tayco* (73 Phil. 509), the Court held that the complaint or information that interrupts prescription is that which is filed in the *proper court*.

In this case, the proper court was the CFI of Camarines Sur. The record showed that no formal complaint or information was filed in the CFI within the six-month reglementary period; the information was filed more than one year after the incident. Consequently, the prescriptive period was never interrupted.

Appeal dismissed; order affirmed.
