I. CAPTION
DAVAO CITY WOMEN'S CLUB, INC. v. REMEDIOS PONFERRADA, G.R. No. L-11843, May 31, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On September 26, 1947, the Provincial Board of Davao donated Lot 72-A to the "Women's Club of Davao" (plaintiff) for a puericulture center. Shortly after, the Board approved a resolution granting Remedios Ponferrada's application to lease a portion of the same lot, subject to a contract to be drawn by the Provincial Fiscal. Upon realizing the overlap, the Board initially excluded the leased portion from the donation but subsequently revoked both the donation and the lease in February 1948. On March 2, 1948, the Board passed Resolution No. 146, donating the *entire* Lot 72-A to the Club. The deed was executed, accepted by the Club, approved by the Secretary of the Interior, and the land was titled in the Club's name in 1950.

The Club filed an action to eject Ponferrada. Ponferrada claimed lease rights and the Province of Davao (third-party defendant) sought to rescind the donation, arguing the Club lacked juridical personality at the time of donation (having incorporated only in 1952) and that the donation required Presidential approval. The trial court upheld the donation but declared Ponferrada a builder in good faith. The Province and Ponferrada appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the donation is valid despite the alleged lack of juridical personality of the donee at the time of execution.
2. W/N the approval of the Secretary of the Interior was sufficient for the donation.
3. W/N the donation could be amended or revoked to accommodate Ponferrada's lease.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Province of Davao is estopped from questioning the donee's capacity. Having approved the resolution and the donation documents, the Province cannot later allege the incapacity of the Club to enter into the contract. The Court cited Article 1302 of the Civil Code, which provides that persons *sui juris* cannot avail themselves of the incapacity of those with whom they contracted. Furthermore, the difference in names ("Women's Club of Davao" vs. "Davao City Women's Club, Inc.") was a mere technicality as they referred to the same organization.

2. **YES.** Although the resolution made the donation subject to the President's approval, the approval by the Secretary of the Interior was sufficient under Section 2596 of the Revised Administrative Code.

3. **NO.** A donation that has been accepted, approved, and is fully operative cannot afterwards be amended by the Provincial Board or the Office of the President. Ponferrada acquired no lease rights because the resolutions granting her application were revoked and the condition precedent—the execution of a lease contract by the Fiscal—was never fulfilled.

**Disposition:** The appealed decision is AFFIRMED.
