I. CAPTION
GUALBERTO CRUZ v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, HON. EMILIANO C. TABIGNE, et al., G.R. No. L-18277, August 31, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Atty. Gualberto Cruz represented employees in CIR Case No. 802-V against Manila Railroad Company, securing a favorable decision for their reinstatement with back wages [1]. Subsequently, a dispute arose regarding attorney's fees. On May 11, 1960, Judge Tabigne issued an order awarding Cruz fees based on a 50% contract but limited to specific periods, while awarding fees to Atty. Rafael and Atty. Flores for other periods [2]. Cruz filed a motion for partial reconsideration, claiming 50% of the *total* recoverable amount based on his contract, and later questioned the trial judge's jurisdiction to modify said contract [3, 4].

The CIR *en banc* issued a resolution on September 20, 1960, reducing Cruz's fees to 10% [4]. Cruz filed a motion for reconsideration (MR) of this *en banc* resolution on November 29, 1960, but the CIR failed to act on it, arguing that only a trial judge's decision is subject to reconsideration *en banc* [5, 6]. Consequently, Cruz filed a petition for mandamus, prohibition, and certiorari with the Supreme Court to compel the CIR to resolve his MR and to restrain the award of fees to the other lawyers [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for mandamus, prohibition, and certiorari may be treated as a petition for review despite the CIR's failure to formally resolve the motion for reconsideration.
2. W/N the CIR *en banc* has the duty to act on a motion for reconsideration of its own resolution.
3. W/N the Court may modify the written contract for attorney's fees stipulating 50% of the recoverable amount.
4. W/N Atty. Cruz is the counsel entitled to the attorney's fees.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While the action was filed as mandamus, prohibition, and certiorari to compel the CIR to act, the Court held that the CIR's inaction on the MR could be interpreted as a denial [8, 9]. Considering all records of the case were already before the Supreme Court, the interest of justice required treating the petition as one for review [9, 10].

2. **YES.** A motion for reconsideration of a resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations *en banc* is a proper matter for consideration and must be acted upon one way or another [8]. The CIR cannot avoid its duty to settle the matter by claiming only trial judge decisions are subject to reconsideration, especially when the resolution was not supported by a majority and required further proceedings [6].

3. **YES.** A written contract of services between a lawyer and a client may be modified by the court if the stipulated fee is found unreasonable considering the nature of the services, pursuant to Sec. 22, Rule 127 of the Rules of Court [11-13]. The Court found the 50% fee unreasonable and affirmed the modification to 30%, which was deemed reasonable given the nature of the case and the length of time the petitioner handled it [13].

4. **YES.** The Court found that petitioner Cruz bore the brunt of the prosecution of the employees' claim to its successful end, attending hearings and conducting the appeal [11, 14]. The other counsel, Atty. Rafael, appeared only after the favorable decision was known, which the Court viewed as a device to deprive Cruz of his due fees [14].

The resolution of September 20, 1960, is AFFIRMED as modified, awarding Atty. Cruz 30% attorney's fees [15].
