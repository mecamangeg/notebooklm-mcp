I. CAPTION
BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS, BUREAU OF IMMIGRATION, COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION and SECURITY OFFICER, DETENTION STATION, ENGINEER ISLAND, Manila v. HON. FELIX R. DOMINGO, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, Branch III, and MONICO MUYA, alias TIU KIM KEE, G.R. No. L-21274, July 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Respondent Monico Muya arrived in the Philippines in 1962 claiming Filipino citizenship, but was detained by immigration authorities after his identity was established as "Tiu Kim Kee," a Chinese stowaway previously deported in 1959. [3, 4] The Board of Commissioners affirmed his exclusion and deportation. [4] After a petition for certiorari was dismissed by the Manila CFI for non-exhaustion of administrative remedies, Muya filed a petition for Declaratory Judgment with Mandamus and Injunction in the CFI of Pangasinan (Case No. D-1442). [4, 5] Respondent Judge Domingo issued a preliminary mandatory injunction ordering Muya's release. [5] Petitioners filed this certiorari action, arguing that citizenship is not a subject for declaratory judgment and that the lower court lacked jurisdiction. [6, 7]

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N citizenship is a proper subject for declaratory judgment.
2. W/N the proper remedy to test the legality of an alien's detention is an action for declaratory judgment with mandamus.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Citizenship is not a proper subject for declaratory judgment. [7] The Court ruled that there is no proceeding established by law or the rules for the judicial declaration of the citizenship of an individual. [7] The Court cited established jurisprudence, including *Palaran v. Republic*, *Tan Yu Chin v. Republic*, and *Delumen v. Republic*, to affirm that Muya was not entitled to the declaratory judgment he sought. [7] Consequently, the issuance of the preliminary mandatory injunction was an abuse of discretion and excess of jurisdiction. [7]

2. **NO.** The proper remedy to test the legality of an alien's detention is *habeas corpus*, not an action for declaratory judgment with incidental mandamus to release him. [8] The Court held that such action should be brought in the court of the place where the detainee is held; since Muya was detained in Manila, the CFI of Pangasinan was the improper venue. [8, 9] Furthermore, Muya failed to exhaust administrative remedies by appealing to the Secretary of Justice before seeking judicial intervention. [8]

The petition is **GRANTED**. The orders of the respondent court and the writ of injunction are **ANNULLED and SET ASIDE**. [10]
