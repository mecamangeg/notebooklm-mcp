I. CAPTION
MANILA YACHT CLUB, INC. v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and RAMON LAGAO, G.R. No. L-19258, May 31, 1968, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Ramon Lagao, employed as a marine engineer and mechanic by Manila Yacht Club, Inc. (Petitioner), contracted tuberculosis due to the nature of his work. Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor ordered Petitioner to pay Lagao compensation benefits and medical expenses. While the case was pending review by the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC), Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss, arguing for the first time that the WCC lacked jurisdiction. Petitioner claimed that as a non-profit, non-stock corporation not engaged in trade for gain, it was exempt from the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 3428). The motion was denied, and the WCC affirmed the monetary award. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, insisting on the jurisdictional defect.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Petitioner's defense of non-coverage under the Workmen's Compensation Act due to its non-profit status was waived.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while the existence of an employer-employee relationship is a jurisdictional foundation, the non-applicability of the Workmen's Compensation Act to a specific employer (e.g., because the establishment is not for gain or the capital is less than P10,000) is merely a matter of defense [1, 2]. This defense is favorable to the employer, and the burden of proof rests upon them to establish it [3]. Consequently, like other affirmative defenses, it must be invoked at the earliest opportunity, otherwise, it is deemed waived [2, 4].

In this case, Petitioner failed to raise the defense of non-coverage during the trials before the Chief Hearing Officer, thereby depriving the officer of the opportunity to make factual findings on the matter [4]. Relying on *Rolan v. Perez* and *Viana v. Al-Lagadan*, the Court ruled that Petitioner's failure to raise the issue on time was fatal to its cause [2, 3].

Petition dismissed [5].
