**I. CAPTION**
MELECIO R. DOMINGO v. HON. LORENZO C. GARLITOS and SIMEONA K. PRICE, G.R. No. L-18994, June 29, 1963, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
In a previous case (*Domingo v. Moscoso*, 1960), the Supreme Court declared final an order requiring the Intestate Estate of Walter Scott Price to pay P40,058.55 in estate and inheritance taxes, charges, and penalties [1]. To enforce this, the Fiscal filed a petition for execution of judgment [1]. Respondent Judge Garlitos denied the petition, finding that the Government was indebted to the Estate in the amount of P262,200 for services rendered by the Leyte Cadastral Survey, Inc., which had been appropriated under Republic Act No. 2700 [1, 2]. The Judge ordered the tax liability to be deducted from the Government's debt to the Estate [2]. Petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus to annul these orders and compel execution, arguing the tax must be paid [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N a writ of execution is the proper remedy to enforce the tax judgment against the Estate.
2. W/N legal compensation applies between the tax liability of the Estate and the debt of the Government to the Estate.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The ordinary procedure to settle claims against a deceased person's estate is to present a claim before the probate court for an order to the administrator to pay, not a writ of execution [3]. During the pendency of proceedings, the estate is in *custodia legis*, and the proper remedy is to ask the court to require the administrator to pay, rather than allowing the sheriff to seize properties [4]. The Court cited *Aldamiz v. Judge of the Court of First Instance of Mindoro* to support this procedural rule [3].

2. **YES.** The Court held that compensation took place by operation of law. The claim of the Estate against the Government was appropriated for by a corresponding law (Rep. Act No. 2700), meaning both the Government's claim for taxes and the Estate's claim for services were overdue, demandable, and fully liquidated [5, 6]. Under Articles 1279 and 1290 of the Civil Code, when these requisites are present, both debts are extinguished to the concurrent amount [6]. Consequently, the petitioner had no clear right to execute the judgment.

The petition is **DISMISSED** [7].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
J.B.L. Reyes, J., concurred in the result [7].
