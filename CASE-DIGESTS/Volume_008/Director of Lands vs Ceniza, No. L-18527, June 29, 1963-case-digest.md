I. CAPTION
DIRECTOR OF LANDS v. HON. PATRICIO C. CENIZA and TEODORO DUMALAGAN, G.R. No. L-18527, June 29, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Teodoro Dumalagan filed an application for registration of a 78-hectare parcel of land in Misamis Occidental. The petitioner, Director of Lands, opposed the application, claiming the land was part of the public domain. During the trial, after Dumalagan completed the presentation of his evidence, the Director of Lands orally moved for the dismissal of the application on the ground of insufficiency of evidence, without making an express reservation to present evidence in case the motion was denied. The respondent Judge Ceniza denied the motion to dismiss and ruled that the case was submitted for decision on the merits, effectively barring the petitioner from presenting evidence. The petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the lack of reservation did not constitute a waiver of the right to present evidence, but the motion was denied.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner waived his right to present evidence by filing a motion to dismiss (demurrer to evidence) without an express reservation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner did not waive his right to present evidence. Under the prevailing rule, clarified in *Arroyo v. Azur* and later embodied in Rule 35, Section 1 of the Revised Rules of Court, a defendant who moves for dismissal on the ground of insufficiency of evidence after the plaintiff rests does not waive the right to offer evidence if the motion is *not* granted. The loss of the right to present evidence applies only when the motion is granted by the trial court but subsequently reversed on appeal. Therefore, the respondent judge committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the petitioner the opportunity to present evidence solely because no reservation was made.

The writ is granted, the orders complained of are set aside, and the respondent Court is directed to proceed with the trial until its final termination.
