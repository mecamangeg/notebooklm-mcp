I. CAPTION
THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE LA LOMA CATHOLIC CEMETERY v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and the LA LOMA CATHOLIC CEMETERY FREE WORKERS (FFW), G.R. No. L-13365, July 31, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On November 21, 1956, the La Loma Catholic Cemetery Free Workers (FFW) filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to be certified as the exclusive bargaining representative for the employees of La Loma Catholic Cemetery [1, 2]. The Superintendent of the cemetery moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that the CIR lacked jurisdiction because the cemetery is a religious temporality and a non-profit enterprise, and therefore not subject to Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act) [2, 3]. The CIR denied the motion, ruling that the cemetery was an employer operated for profit due to its income from the sale of lots, lease of niches, and registration fees [3, 4]. The CIR en banc affirmed the order [3]. The Superintendent appealed to the Supreme Court via certiorari [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the La Loma Catholic Cemetery is operated for profit and thus subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations under Republic Act No. 875. [5]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CIR's resolution and dismissed the case [6]. The Court ruled that La Loma Catholic Cemetery is a purely religious temporality and a non-profit enterprise [7]. Relying on the doctrine in *Boy Scouts of the Philippines v. Araos*, the Court held that employees of non-profit organizations are not covered by the Industrial Peace Act, and the CIR lacks jurisdiction over them [7]. The Court found no substantial evidence that the cemetery was operated for profit; the fact that it derives income from the sale of lots and lease of niches does not make it a profit-making organization [8]. There was no evidence that monetary profits existed after deducting operation expenses, nor that income inured to the benefit of private individuals [9, 10]. Rather, the income is dedicated to the maintenance of the cemetery, which is administered by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila for the religious objective of burying the dead according to Catholic rites [9, 11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Concepcion, J.** (Ponente) noted that while he had dissented from the majority view in the *Boy Scouts of the Philippines* case (the controlling doctrine), he adhered to the doctrine in this case as it had not been reversed or modified [7].
