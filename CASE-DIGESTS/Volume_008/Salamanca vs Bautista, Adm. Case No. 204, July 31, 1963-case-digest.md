I. CAPTION
PATRICIO SALAMANCA v. ATTY. FELICIANO R. BAUTISTA, Adm. Case No. 204, July 31, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Patricio Salamanca filed an administrative charge for malpractice against his counsel, Atty. Feliciano R. Bautista. Salamanca alleged that Bautista fraudulently induced him to sign a compromise agreement in a civil case (Salamanca v. Torres) favoring his adversary. Salamanca claimed he did not understand the contents of the document because it was written in Tagalog (he being Ilocano) and that it was prejudicial, as he allegedly received only P200.00 out of his P3,000.00 claim [1, 2]. The Office of the Solicitor General initially recommended disciplinary action [1]. However, the record showed that Salamanca signed the document in August 1953 but only objected to it in January 1955 [3]. Evidence also revealed that the agreement actually stipulated that a sugar mill would be sold with the proceeds given to Salamanca [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Atty. Bautista is guilty of malpractice for deceitfully inducing his client to sign the compromise agreement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court found no evidence of deception. First, the claim regarding the language barrier was rejected because Tagalog is generally understood in San Jose, Nueva Ecija, where the incidents occurred, and Salamanca had previously signed the contract hiring Bautista in Tagalog without alleging deceit [2, 4]. Second, the "prejudicial" amount was inaccurate; the agreement provided for the sale of a sugar mill with proceeds to be delivered to Salamanca, not just the P200.00 cash [4].

Third, the Court applied the principle that a client's long silence and failure to object implies knowledge and consent. Salamanca waited 17 months after signing before objecting, and his own relative (a law student) admitted Salamanca understood the settlement back in 1953 [3, 5]. Finally, Salamanca failed to prosecute his civil action against the adversary for seven years, further negating the claim of connivance or fraud by his lawyer [6].

The administrative complaint is dismissed.
