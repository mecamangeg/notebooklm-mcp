I. CAPTION
COMMERCIAL BANK & TRUST COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES v. REPUBLIC ARMORED CAR SERVICE CORPORATION and DAMASO PEREZ, G.R. Nos. L-18223-24, June 29, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Commercial Bank & Trust Co. (plaintiff) granted credit accommodations in the form of overdraft lines to Republic Armored Car Service Corp. and Damaso Perez (defendants). In G.R. No. L-18223, the defendants drew approximately P80,000, and in G.R. No. L-18224, they drew approximately P133,000 [1, 2]. When the plaintiff demanded payment, the defendants admitted drawing the amounts but refused to pay. They alleged as a special defense that the corporation’s former officers and directors had defrauded and mismanaged the corporation to wrest control from Damaso Perez, and that the funds drawn were misappropriated by said officers [1, 2].

The Court of First Instance of Manila rendered judgment on the pleadings in favor of the plaintiff, ruling that the alleged mismanagement was an internal affair that did not diminish the defendants' liability to the bank [1, 3]. The defendants appealed, arguing they should be allowed to file a third-party complaint against the erring officers [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the mismanagement or fraud by the corporation's agents/former officers relieves the defendants of liability to the plaintiff bank.
2. W/N the defendants can file a third-party complaint against the erring officers to resist the plaintiff's claim.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that under general principles of law, the mismanagement of the business of a party by his agents does not relieve said party from the responsibility that he had contracted to third persons [4]. The written credit agreements contained no limitation on the defendants' liability, nor was there any condition that responsibility would cease upon misappropriation of funds by employees [6, 7]. The admission of indebtedness rendered the special defense of mismanagement a "sham defense" [6].

2. **NO.** A third-party complaint is not available to the defendants under these facts. Under Section 1, Rule 12 of the Rules of Court, a third-party complaint is available only if the defendant has a right to demand contribution, indemnity, subrogation, or any other relief from the supposed third-party defendants *in respect to the plaintiff's claim* [5]. The alleged erring officers had nothing to do with the overdraft account between the defendant corporation and the plaintiff bank; thus, they cannot be made parties in a third-party complaint regarding this specific obligation [5, 8].

The judgments appealed from are **AFFIRMED** [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred. Chief Justice Bengzon took no part [9].
