**I. CAPTION**
EMIGDIO SORIANO and BEATRIZ DE VERA v. THE HEIRS OF DOMINGO MAGALI, et al., G.R. No. L-15133, July 31, 1963, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Spouses Domingo Magali and Modesta Calimlim were the registered owners of a parcel of land covered by O.C.T. No. 51878. In 1939, they sold a portion to Spouses Cerezo, who in turn sold it to Maximino Mamorno in 1941. These sales were not registered. In January 1944, Mamorno verbally sold the land back to Modesta Calimlim (Respondent) for P5,000.00. No formal deed was executed, but Mamorno delivered the muniments of title and possession to Calimlim.

On April 5, 1946, Francisca Reyes (Mamorno's widow) sold the same property to Spouses Soriano (Petitioners). Petitioners registered their deeds of sale under Act No. 3344 on April 9, 1946. They subsequently filed an action for *reivindicacion* against the Heirs of Magali. The lower court ruled in favor of the Heirs, finding that Calimlim had been in continuous possession since 1944 based on a prior forcible entry judgment and documentary evidence admitted without objection.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the verbal sale between Mamorno and Calimlim was valid and enforceable despite the Statute of Frauds.
2. W/N Petitioners' registration under Act No. 3344 prevails over Respondents' prior possession in a case of double sale.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court held that the Statute of Frauds applies only to executory sales of real property, not to those consummated by the delivery of the property to the vendee. In this case, the sale was consummated when Mamorno delivered the muniments of title and possession of the land to Calimlim in 1944. Furthermore, documentary evidence establishing the sale (an affidavit by Mamorno's father) was admitted without objection during trial, giving it probative value.

2. **NO.** Under Article 1544 of the Civil Code (formerly Article 1473) regarding double sales, ownership belongs to the person who in good faith first recorded the sale in the Registry of Property. However, Petitioners registered their sale under Act No. 3344, which applies only to unregistered land. Since the land was registered under the Land Registration Act (Act No. 496), the Act No. 3344 registration was ineffective and did not bind the land. Consequently, the rule of "first in possession in good faith" applies. Since Calimlim took possession in good faith in 1944, prior to Petitioners' purchase in 1946, ownership pertains to Respondents.

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.
