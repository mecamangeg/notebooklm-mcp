**I. CAPTION**
J. M. TUASON & CO., ETC. v. RICARDO BALOY, G.R. No. L-16727, May 30, 1963, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
On June 7, 1959, J. M. Tuason & Co. filed a complaint against Ricardo Baloy in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to recover possession of a parcel of land and collect rentals. On October 21, 1959, the CFI rendered a decision in favor of Tuason & Co. The decision became final and executory, and a writ of execution was issued on December 5, 1959. On December 16, 1959, Baloy filed a petition for relief from judgment. Tuason & Co. opposed the petition, arguing it lacked the required affidavit of merit. The CFI denied the petition, ruling that it failed to comply with the Rules of Court as it was not supported by an affidavit of merit alleging fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence [1, 2]. Baloy appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petition for relief from judgment was properly denied due to the insufficiency of the affidavit of merit.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** A petition for relief must be certified and accompanied by an affidavit of merit setting forth facts sufficient to constitute one of the grounds for relief under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court. While an affidavit subscribed by Baloy's counsel appeared in the Record on Appeal—presumably filed to cure the initial defect—the allegations therein were substantively insufficient [3, 4]. The affidavit failed to prove fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence, nor did it show a valid defense in favor of the party seeking relief [3, 4]. Without these elements, the petition cannot be granted.

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [5].
