I. CAPTION
**RE: CANCELLATION OF A MEMORANDUM ANNOTATED ON TRANSFER CERTIFICATE OF TITLE No. 1754. ROSA M. VDA. DE ZABALJAURREGUI v. LUZON SURETY CO., INC.**, G.R. No. L-16251, August 31, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On October 2, 1952, John V. Svanholm was granted a conditional pardon for estafa, conditioned on his leaving the Philippines and paying an indemnity to the Government. He paid a portion and posted a surety bond with Luzon Surety Co., Inc. (Oppositor-Appellant) for the balance of P11,000. As a counter-guaranty, Rosa M. Vda. de Zabaljaurregui (Petitioner-Appellee) executed a mortgage on her property (TCT No. 1754) in favor of Luzon Surety.

The bond stipulated that the surety's liability would expire 46 months from the date of execution (August 2, 1956), and the Government waived its right to file any action for claims not presented within three months after expiration. Svanholm defaulted on P4,900. However, the Government failed to present any claim against the surety by the November 2, 1956 deadline. In 1959, Zabaljaurregui filed a petition with the CFI of Baguio (as a land registration court) to cancel the mortgage annotation, arguing the surety was released. Luzon Surety opposed, claiming the Government might still sue and that the land registration court lacked jurisdiction over the "controversial" matter. The trial court granted the cancellation.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the cancellation of the counter-guaranty mortgage on the petitioner’s title was proper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the lower court's order. The bond expressly provided that the obligee (Government) waived its right to file any court action for claims not presented within three months of the bond's expiration [1]. Since the deadline passed on November 2, 1956, without any claim filed by the Government, the surety could no longer be held liable [2]. The Court distinguished this from *Pao Chuan Wei v. Nomorosa*, noting that in the present case, the Government evinced no desire to hold the surety responsible and the claim was effectively waived [3].

Regarding the procedural objection, the Court ruled that under Section 112 of Act 496, a land registration court may act if there is no "serious objection." Luzon Surety's objection was deemed not serious enough to require a separate ordinary action, especially given the Government's indifference and the unassailable fact that the bond liability had expired [4]. As the principal obligation (surety liability) had ceased, the accessory mortgage must also be cancelled [4]. The order appealed from is affirmed [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
