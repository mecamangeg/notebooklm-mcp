I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LUCAS CANITAN, ET AL., BALTAZAR CAUSI (Defendant-Appellant), G.R. No. L-16498, June 29, 1963, 8 SCRA 358, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On September 24, 1951, in Janiuay, Iloilo, Lucas Canitan and appellant Baltazar Causi plotted to kill Roque Estrada while drinking tuba. Canitan held a grudge against Estrada for allegedly having illicit relations with his wife, while Causi was angry at Estrada, his brother-in-law, for abandoning his sister. At around 8:00 P.M., armed with a jungle knife and a bolo (*ginunting*), they located Estrada at a neighbor's house. Canitan struggled with Estrada, who managed to escape and run. Canitan and Causi chased him. Upon catching up, Canitan stabbed Estrada, and Causi struck him on the head with his bolo. They buried the body in a muddy area.

Procedurally, the Court of First Instance originally convicted both accused. Only Causi appealed. Due to the loss of stenographic notes, the case was remanded twice. Finally, the lower court convicted Causi of Murder, sentencing him to death, appreciating the aggravating circumstances of treachery and relationship by affinity. Causi appealed, denying participation and claiming he was merely present.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N appellant Causi participated in the killing of the deceased.
2. W/N evident premeditation attended the commission of the crime.
3. W/N treachery attended the commission of the crime.
4. W/N relationship by affinity is an aggravating circumstance.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Appellant’s denial cannot be given credence over his clear confession signed four days after the crime. Furthermore, autopsy findings corroborated his participation: the victim sustained wounds from two different weapons—sharp-pointed thrusts (jungle knife) and elongated slashing wounds (bolo)—proving that two assailants inflicted the injuries [1].

2. **YES.** The scheme to kill was plotted at 5:30 P.M., and the slaying occurred past 8:00 P.M. the same evening. Sufficient time had elapsed for the accused to meditate and reflect upon their decision to kill [2].

3. **NO.** Treachery requires means employed to ensure execution without risk to the offender. Here, a struggle for possession of the knife occurred between the deceased and Canitan before the chase ensued. This struggle negates the attendance of treachery [2].

4. **NO.** Relationship by affinity is not an aggravating circumstance unless the evidence shows the offended party is of a higher degree in the relationship than the offender. No such evidence was presented here [2].

**Disposition:** The judgment is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the penalty is reduced to *reclusion perpetua*, there being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances [3].
