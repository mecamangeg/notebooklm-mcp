I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. KUSAIN SAIK, QUIAMA AKAN, and LUZON SURETY COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-17060, May 30, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Defendants Kusain Saik and Quiama Akan were convicted of murder by the Court of First Instance of Cotabato. Akan appealed, and Luzon Surety Company, Inc. posted a P14,000 bond for his provisional release [1, 2]. After the Supreme Court dismissed Akan's appeal, the trial court set the promulgation of judgment [2]. Luzon Surety requested extensions to produce the accused, claiming loss of contact, and eventually moved to be relieved of liability, alleging that Akan had died in a skirmish with the Philippine Constabulary in Lanao [2].

The trial court initially ordered the forfeiture of the full P14,000 bond [2]. Luzon Surety moved to set aside the execution, submitting as evidence a letter from a municipal mayor, an Arabic letter from a bandit leader, and a joint affidavit of two individuals, all stating Akan had died on November 15, 1956 [3]. Relying on these documents, the trial court issued an order reducing the surety's liability to P500, ruling that the failure to produce the accused was due to circumstances beyond its control [4]. The Assistant Provincial Fiscal appealed this order [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in reducing the bond liability based on the affidavits and letters submitted to prove the accused's death.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the order, ruling that the death of the accused cannot be deemed established by the evidence presented, which it classified as hearsay [5]. The Court held that if a trial court desires to reduce a forfeited bail bond based on claims of the accused's death, it must examine the affiants and authors of the documents under oath [5, 6]. The fact of death must be determined by "admissible and competent evidence," not merely by affidavits or letters from third parties who were not subjected to court examination [5, 7].

The Order appealed from is **SET ASIDE**, and the case is remanded to the lower court to determine the fact of death by admissible and competent evidence [5].
