I. CAPTION
BOTELHO SHIPPING CORPORATION v. HON. JOSE N. LEUTERIO, SENATOR FERDINAND MARCOS, REPRESENTATIVE RAMON BAGATSING and ABELARDO SUBIDO, G.R. No. L-20420, May 30, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Botelho Shipping Corporation applied for ocean-going vessels under the Reparations Program. On May 9, 1960, the Reparations Commission submitted a tentative schedule for the fifth reparations year to the President via the National Economic Council (NEC), including vessels valued at $6.6 million [1]. On September 19, 1960, the NEC recommended approval but eliminated the vessels and reduced the total amount, based on verbal information that the Japanese Government would only approve around $30 million [1, 2]. However, the NEC noted that if a larger amount were arranged, deferred projects could be included [2].

On May 16, 1961, the President approved a schedule restoring the vessels and increasing the total value to $79,634,056.00 [3]. The Japanese Government subsequently agreed to a final schedule of $88,783,386.00, and petitioner was awarded a vessel [4]. Respondents (Marcos, et al.) filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to declare the "expanded" schedule null and void for deviating from the NEC’s recommendation [5]. The CFI ruled that the expanded schedule was void insofar as it included projects not recommended by the NEC and issued a permanent injunction against petitioner [6]. Petitioner filed for certiorari [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the recommendation of the National Economic Council regarding the reparations schedule is binding upon the President under Republic Act No. 1789.
2. W/N Republic Act No. 3079, which requires strict adherence to NEC priorities, applies retroactively to the subject schedule.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that under Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. 1789 (prior to its amendment), the NEC’s recommendation is merely advisory [8, 9]. The President’s approval of the schedule is designed to form the basis of consultation between the Philippine and Japanese Governments [9]. Legislative deliberations confirm that the NEC functions only as an advisory body to the President regarding the reparations program [10]. Additionally, the NEC's reduction of the schedule was conditional upon the limited amount Japan was expected to approve; since Japan approved a much larger amount, the restoration of the vessels was justified [11, 12].

2. **NO.** Republic Act No. 3079, which amended R.A. 1789 to require that projects be strictly priority-rated by the NEC, was enacted on July 17, 1961 [13]. The President approved the tentative schedule in question on May 16, 1961, prior to the amendment [3, 13]. The Court ruled that R.A. 3079 cannot be given retroactive effect to invalidate the President's prior approval [13].

The petition is GRANTED, and the judgment and injunction of the respondent court are set aside and annulled [14].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Justices Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, and Regala concurred; Chief Justice Bengzon took no part) [14].
