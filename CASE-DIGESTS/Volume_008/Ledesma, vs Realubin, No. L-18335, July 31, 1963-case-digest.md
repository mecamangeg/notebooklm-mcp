**I. CAPTION**
**SALUD LEDESMA v. ALBERTO REALUBIN and COURT OF APPEALS**, G.R. No. L-18335, July 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Salud Ledesma purchased gasoline and motor oil on credit from respondent Alberto Realubin’s service station between June and September 1956 [1]. The invoices were signed by Ledesma's drivers. Under Realubin's business practice, he retained the original "white" invoices for credit purchases and only released them upon payment; at the time of trial, he still possessed the original invoices for the disputed months [2, 3]. Ledesma subsequently sent a handwritten letter admitting her inability to pay and asking for patience [3, 4].

The trial court ruled in favor of Realubin [5]. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the decision but modified it by increasing the attorney's fees and raising the interest rate from 6% to 12% per annum, despite Realubin not appealing the trial court's decision [5, 6]. Ledesma appealed to the Supreme Court, invoking the presumption of payment under Article 1171 of the Civil Code, arguing that since she paid for purchases in October 1956, the prior purchases should be presumed paid [7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the presumption of payment of prior obligations applies given the payment of subsequent purchases.
2. W/N the appellate court can increase attorney's fees despite the winning party not appealing the amount.
3. W/N the appellate court can increase the interest rate on the main debt despite the winning party not appealing the rate.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The presumption cannot prevail over a proven fact. Realubin proved that the prior purchases were unpaid (evidenced by his possession of the original invoices) and that the subsequent October purchases were made in cash, not on credit [7]. The Court held that "between a proven fact and a presumption *pro tanto*, the former stands, and the latter falls" [7].

2. **YES.** The attorney's fees awarded by the trial court could not have included services rendered during the appeal, as the appeal had not yet occurred. The Court of Appeals has the authority to fix counsel fees in accordance with justice and equity to cover the additional legal services required [6].

3. **NO.** The Court of Appeals erred in increasing the interest rate from 6% to 12%. The respondent's failure to appeal the trial court's decision signified his assent to the 6% rate fixed by the trial judge, even though the documents stipulated a 12% interest rate [6].

**Disposition:** The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed with modification that the main award shall earn interest at the legal rate from July 18, 1959, until fully paid [8].
