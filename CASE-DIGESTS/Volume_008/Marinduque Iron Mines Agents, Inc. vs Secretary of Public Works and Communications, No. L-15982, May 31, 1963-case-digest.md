I. CAPTION
MARINDUQUE IRON MINES AGENTS, INC. v. THE SECRETARY OF PUBLIC WORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS, G.R. No. L-15982, May 31, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
The Respondent Secretary of Public Works and Communications, acting under Republic Act No. 2056, found that Petitioner Marinduque Iron Mines Agents, Inc. had illegally constructed a causeway at the mouth of the Calat-an River in Negros Occidental [1, 2]. On January 16, 1959, the Respondent issued a decision ordering Petitioner to remove the structure and restore the riverbed within 30 days [1]. Instead of appealing this decision to the President, Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to annul the order [1]. The CFI dismissed the petition for lack of cause of action, ruling that Petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not first appealing to the President [2, 3]. Petitioner appealed this dismissal to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Petitioner was required to appeal the Secretary's decision to the President before seeking judicial relief.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that prior appeal to the President was unnecessary for two reasons.

First, Republic Act No. 2056 prescribes peremptory periods (30 days) for the removal of illegal obstructions and imposes criminal penalties for non-compliance [2, 4]. The statute does not explicitly provide for an appeal to the President, and such an appeal would not be expeditious enough or adequate because it might not stay the execution of the demolition order [5-7].

Second, applying the doctrine of qualified political agency (or the alter ego doctrine) as enunciated in *Dimaisip v. Court of Appeals*, the Secretary of a Department is an alter ego of the President [7]. The Secretary's action bears the implied sanction of the President unless disapproved; thus, failure to appeal to the President does not preclude the plaintiff from taking immediate court action [8].

The Order appealed from was **REVERSED**, and the case was **REMANDED** to the court *a quo* for trial and judgment on the merits [8].
