I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FELICIANO RAMOS alias CIANO, G.R. Nos. L-17402 and L-17403, August 31, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Feliciano Ramos was charged with murder and illegal possession of a firearm. On February 20, 1959, in Luna, La Union, eyewitness Saturnino Velasco saw Ramos shoot the victim, Ricardo Nodora, from behind three times, killing him [1-3]. Following his arrest, Ramos executed two extrajudicial confessions (Exhibits "B" and "D") admitting to the killing and the possession of the gun, which he subscribed and sworn to before two different Justices of the Peace [4, 5]. During the joint trial, Ramos claimed he was maltreated and forced by Constabulary soldiers to sign the confessions [6]. He also interposed the defense of alibi, claiming he was fishing at sea during the incident [7]. The Court of First Instance of La Union convicted Ramos on both charges [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the extrajudicial confessions were voluntary and admissible.
2. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over the positive identification by the eyewitness.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the finding of voluntariness should be upheld. If the confessions were secured by force, Ramos should have revealed this fact to the two judges before whom he swore to their truth [10]. He had multiple opportunities to disclose any injustice when he appeared before Judge Arciaga and Judge Bautista, yet he admitted the truth of the contents and signed them freely [10].

2. **NO.** Alibi is a weak defense that cannot prevail when there is positive identification by an eyewitness [11]. The eyewitness, Velasco, positively identified Ramos and had no motive to falsify his testimony [11]. The Court cited *People vs. Layos*, noting that an eyewitness's inability to recall specific details like clothing is insignificant when attention is focused on the attack [11].

The judgment for murder is affirmed. The penalty for illegal possession of firearm is **MODIFIED** to an indeterminate sentence of not less than two (2) years nor more than five (5) years in prison pursuant to Sec. 2692 of the Revised Administrative Code as amended [12, 13].
