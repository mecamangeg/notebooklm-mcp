I. CAPTION
BERNARDO ESTOESTA v. THE MUNICIPAL MAYOR AND THE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL OF AGOO, LA UNION, G.R. No. L-18849, June 29, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Bernardo Estoesta, the Chief of Police of Agoo, La Union, was suspended and charged administratively with serious misconduct. The Municipal Council conducted a formal hearing and subsequently reached a unanimous verdict of guilt. Through a secret ballot, the Council voted to impose the penalty of "forced resignation." The Council then created a committee to draft the written decision in appropriate language. On February 28, 1959, the Council passed Resolution No. 26, unanimously adopting the draft submitted by the committee; all Council members affixed their signatures to the decision. The Commissioner of Civil Service upheld the verdict, and the Civil Service Board of Appeals dismissed Estoesta's appeal for being filed late. On September 16, 1960, approximately one and a half years after his forced resignation, Estoesta filed a motion for reinstatement. When this was ignored, he filed a petition for declaratory relief, certiorari, and mandamus with the Court of First Instance of La Union. The CFI dismissed the petition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the administrative decision dismissing the petitioner is valid even though it was drafted by a committee.
2. W/N the petitioner’s action for reinstatement is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The decision is valid. The Supreme Court held that while the draft was penned by a committee, the decision itself was made by the entire Municipal Council. Resolution No. 26 expressly stated that the committee was created *after* the Council had already reached its verdict and that all members affixed their signatures to the decision. Thus, the decision was that of the Council acting as a body, and no right of the petitioner was violated [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The action is barred. The Court ruled that the petitioner forfeited his right to reinstatement due to his delay of one and a half years. For reasons of public policy, an action for reinstatement to a civil service position must be filed within one year (*Unabia v. Mayor of Cebu*; *Gonzales v. Rodriguez*; *Mesias v. Jover*) [3].

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
