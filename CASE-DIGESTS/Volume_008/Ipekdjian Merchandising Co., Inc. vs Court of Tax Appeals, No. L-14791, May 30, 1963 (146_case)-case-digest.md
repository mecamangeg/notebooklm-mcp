I. CAPTION
IPEKDJIAN MERCHANDISING CO., INC. v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS and COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-14791, May 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On January 11, 1951, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed Petitioner Ipekdjian Merchandising Co., Inc. the sum of P97,502.25 for compensating tax and surcharges, plus a penalty of P200.00 [1]. Petitioner appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals (BTA Case No. 10), which affirmed the CIR's decision [2]. Petitioner then appealed to the Supreme Court, but on March 30, 1954, the Court dismissed the appeal without prejudice citing *U.S.T. v. Board of Tax Appeals*, effectively ruling the BTA was an administrative body [2]. This dismissal became final and executory on May 14, 1954 [3].

On June 16, 1954, Republic Act No. 1125 took effect, creating the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) and abolishing the BTA [4]. Petitioner attempted to reinstate its appeal or file a new case with the CTA, but these were dismissed for being filed beyond the prescriptive period [2]. Petitioner subsequently made a partial payment of P5,000.00 [5]. On February 26, 1958, the CIR filed a motion for execution of judgment with the CTA to collect the balance. The CTA granted the motion [5]. Petitioner challenged this, arguing the CTA lacked jurisdiction because the BTA case was already terminated and not "pending" as required by Section 21 of R.A. 1125 for transfer to the CTA [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Tax Appeals has jurisdiction to order the execution of a final decision rendered by the defunct Board of Tax Appeals.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the CTA has the authority to execute the decision. Under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 1125, all cases "pending" in the BTA were transferred to the CTA [4]. The Court interpreted "pending" to include not only cases filed but not heard, or heard but not decided, but also those "filed, heard and decided, but the judgment of which has not yet been executed and fully satisfied" [7], [8].

The Court explained that execution is the "fruit and end of the suit" and "the life of the law" [9]. A suit does not terminate with the judgment; proceedings on execution are considered proceedings in the suit [10], [9]. Furthermore, R.A. No. 1125 conferred judicial character on the proceedings and decisions of the BTA [11]. Since the BTA decision had become final and executory, it is enforceable by execution like any other court decision, and the CTA, having taken over the functions of the BTA, is the proper forum to enforce it [12], [13].

Petition dismissed [14].
