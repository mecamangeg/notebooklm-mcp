I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. POLICARPIO TIONGSON Y GARCIA AND MAURICIO NAVARRO Y ORDILLO**, Nos. L-15201-02, May 31, 1963, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
The Supreme Court promulgated its decision in the main case on October 31, 1962. After the decision allegedly became final and executory, the records were remanded for execution [1]. However, defendant Tiongson filed an urgent petition on January 11, 1963, claiming he received notice of the decision only on that date [2]. He prayed to set aside the entry of judgment and requested a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain the Director of Prisons from executing the judgment scheduled for January 19, 1963 [2].

The Court granted the petition, issued the preliminary writ of injunction, and gave Tiongson time to file a Motion for Reconsideration [3]. Tiongson filed his Motion for Reconsideration on January 31, 1963, which was denied on February 7, 1963 [3]. A second Motion for Reconsideration was filed on February 28, 1963, but was also denied on March 4, 1963 [4]. Subsequently, Judge Morfe of the Court of First Instance of Manila requested clarification from the Supreme Court regarding the status of the preliminary writ of injunction [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the writ of preliminary injunction is deemed set aside upon the denial of the motions for reconsideration.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that with the denial of the motions for reconsideration, the preliminary writ of injunction is deemed set aside [4]. The writ was issued specifically to restrain the execution of the judgment while the decision was being sought to be reconsidered [5]. Once the motions were denied and the judgment became final, the injunction no longer had any basis or effect.

The writ of preliminary injunction is set aside [6].
