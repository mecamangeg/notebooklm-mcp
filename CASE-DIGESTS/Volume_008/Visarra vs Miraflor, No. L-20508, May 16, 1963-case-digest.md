I. CAPTION
GENARO VISARRA v. CESAR MIRAFLOR, G.R. No. L-20508, May 16, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In *Republic v. Imperial*, the Supreme Court established three lines of succession for the Commission on Elections (COMELEC): (1) the Chairman; (2) the second member; and (3) the third member, with staggered terms [1]. Gaudencio Garcia was appointed Member in 1955, occupying the third line with a term expiring on June 20, 1962 [2]. In 1959, Chairman Carag (occupying the first line with a term expiring in 1968) retired [2].

On May 12, 1960, the President appointed Garcia as Chairman to succeed Carag [2]. On the same day, petitioner Genaro Visarra was appointed Member, with his nomination stating a term expiring on June 20, 1968 [3], [4]. Garcia served as Chairman until June 1962 [4]. Subsequently, Juan V. Borra was appointed Chairman, and in November 1962, respondent Cesar Miraflor was appointed Member on the assumption that Visarra's term had expired in June 1962 (the end of Garcia’s original Member term) [4]. Visarra filed a *quo warranto* petition, claiming his appointment was for the vacancy left by Carag (expiring 1968) and that Garcia had not vacated the third line but continued in it while Chairman [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a COMELEC Member promoted to Chairman leaves his original line of succession, thereby limiting his successor's term to the unexpired portion of the Member's original term.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court dismissed the petition for *quo warranto* [6]. Relying on the doctrine in *Republic v. Imperial*, the Court held that when a Commissioner is appointed Chairman, he leaves his original line of succession and enters the line of the Chairman [1], [5]. Consequently, when Garcia was appointed Chairman in 1960, he vacated his position as Member in the third line (term expiring June 1962) [7]. Visarra, as Garcia's successor, merely occupied the position vacated by Garcia [1].

Although Visarra's appointment specified a term expiring in 1968, his tenure could not extend beyond the fixed term of the position he occupied in the fixed line of succession [8], [9]. Since the position Visarra filled was the one vacated by Garcia, Visarra's term expired on June 20, 1962 [1]. Thus, a valid vacancy existed which was filled by the appointment of respondent Miraflor [10]. The Court reaffirmed that subsequent appointments after the first commissioners can only be for the unexpired portion of the predecessor's term to preserve the staggered rotation intended by the Constitution [11], [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
*   **Bautista Angelo, J. (Concurring):** Concurred based on *stare decisis* (*Imperial* and *Nacionalista Party v. Vera*). Promotion from Member to Chairman is not the "reappointment" prohibited by the Constitution [13], [14].
*   **Makalintal, J. (Concurring):** The position of Chairman is distinct from that of members; a promoted member vacates his old position [15].
*   **Concepcion, J. (Dissenting):** The constitutional ban on reappointment applies to promotions. Garcia did not leave his line; thus, Visarra filled the only actual vacancy (Carag's line, expiring 1968) [16], [17].
*   **Reyes, J.B.L., J. (Dissenting):** Garcia’s promotion was void *ab initio* as it violated bans on reappointment and salary increase [18], [19]. Visarra was validly appointed to the full term of Carag’s vacancy (1968) [3].
*   **Barrera, J. (Dissenting):** The majority view allows a President to appoint all three members within one term [20]. Tenure cannot be separated from the term of office [21].
*   **Paredes, J. (Dissenting):** The majority opinion subverts the independence of the Commission [22].
*   **Dizon, J. (Dissenting):** Chairmanship is merely an incident of membership [23]. Garcia did not leave his line; Visarra filled Carag's vacancy [24].
