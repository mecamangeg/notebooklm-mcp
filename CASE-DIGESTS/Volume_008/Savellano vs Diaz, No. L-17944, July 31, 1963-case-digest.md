I. CAPTION
MARTIN SAVELLANO v. PELAGIA M. DIAZ and PABLO DIAZ, G.R. No. L-17944, July 31, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On December 28, 1954, Pelagia Diaz executed a public instrument conveying the possession and usufruct of two hectares of land in Davao to Martin Savellano for P600.00, to last until the amount was returned. Savellano took actual possession and maintained the hemp stalks thereon. In November 1956, claiming that Savellano's harvests had already extinguished the debt, Pelagia and her husband Pablo Diaz forcibly entered the property and harvested hemp. Savellano filed a complaint for forcible entry with the Justice of the Peace Court, which ruled in his favor. On appeal, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao likewise ruled for Savellano, ordering his restoration to the property. The spouses Diaz appealed directly to the Supreme Court, disputing the finding of possession and arguing that the CFI should have converted the case into an action for accounting.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellants can dispute the trial court's findings of fact regarding possession in this appeal.
2. W/N the appellants could validly reacquire possession through force on the belief that the debt had been extinguished.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Where an appeal is taken directly to the Supreme Court, the appellants are deemed to have waived the right to dispute any finding of fact made by the trial court, which becomes binding on the appellate Court [1-3]. The only questions that may be raised are those of law. Thus, the CFI's finding that Savellano was in actual possession since 1954 stands [4].

2. **NO.** **Article 536 of the Civil Code** provides that in no case may possession be acquired through force or intimidation as long as there is a possessor who objects thereto [5, 6]. Even if the appellants believed they had a right to deprive Savellano of the holding of the thing, they must invoke the aid of a competent court if the holder refuses to deliver it [6]. Taking the law into their own hands was unwarranted, and the action of forcible entry was the proper remedy for the appellee [5, 6].

The judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED [7].
