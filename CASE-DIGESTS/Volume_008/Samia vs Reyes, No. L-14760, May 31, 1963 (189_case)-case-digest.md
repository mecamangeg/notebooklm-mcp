I. CAPTION
ANTONIO M. SAMIA v. ROMAN REYES, MARIANO DE GULA, TlTO ALDANA, MARIANO MANUEL, and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-14760, May 31, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On May 15, 1956, petitioner Antonio M. Samia filed unlawful detainer cases against respondents Roman Reyes et al. in the Municipal Court of Manila [1]. Respondents moved to suspend the proceedings invoking Republic Act No. 1599, which authorizes the suspension of ejectment suits against tenants of landed estates subject to expropriation [1, 2]. The Municipal Court suspended proceedings on the condition that respondents pay current rentals, and later ordered them to liquidate arrears in installments [3, 4]. Respondents failed to comply with these payments [5]. Consequently, the Municipal Court rendered judgment ordering them to vacate the premises and pay rentals [6]. Respondents appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) but failed to file supersedeas bonds or pay current rentals pending appeal [6]. The CFI issued writs of execution [6]. The respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals, which upheld their cause [7, 8]. Samia filed the instant petition for certiorari [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the suspension of ejectment proceedings under R.A. No. 1162 and R.A. No. 1599 applies to tenants who fail to pay current rentals and liquidate arrears.
2. W/N the immediate execution of the ejectment judgment pending appeal is authorized.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Sections 1 and 5 of R.A. No. 1599 (amending R.A. No. 1162), tenants must perform two positive acts to avail of the suspension of ejectment proceedings: (1) pay current rentals, and (2) if in arrears, liquidate the amount within eighteen months [10]. The laws never contemplated a situation where proceedings are suspended without the payment of requisite rentals [11]. It is not within the intent of the law for the State to deprive the owner of rentals pending expropriation proceedings [7, 11]. Since respondents failed to pay, they are not entitled to the suspension [7, 12].

2. **YES.** Under Section 8, Rule 72 of the Rules of Court, immediate execution of a judgment in favor of the plaintiff in ejectment cases is authorized [8, 13]. The only exceptions are when the defendant: (1) perfects an appeal, (2) files a supersedeas bond to stay execution, *and* (3) pays the plaintiff or deposits in court the current rentals during the pendency of the appeal [8, 13]. Respondents failed to fulfill these requisites; thus, the CFI had no alternative but to issue the writs of execution [8].

The Writ is granted; the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the validity of the orders and writs of execution issued by the Court of First Instance is sustained [14].
