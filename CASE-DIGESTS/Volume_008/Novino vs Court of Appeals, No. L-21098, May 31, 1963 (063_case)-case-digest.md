I. CAPTION
CARMEN P. NOVINO and RODOLFO NOVINO v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, LINA Y. FUENTES, RAFAEL FUENTES and PEOPLE'S HOMESITE AND HOUSING CORPORATION (PHHC), G.R. No. L-21098, May 31, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Carmen Novino sold real property she acquired from the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC) to respondents Lina and Rafael Fuentes. She later sought to annul the sale, arguing she did not obtain the consent of her "husband," Rodolfo Novino. The Court of Appeals (CA) found that Carmen and Rodolfo’s marriage was void *ab initio* because both had surviving spouses from prior subsisting marriages. Consequently, the CA ruled the sale valid, holding that Rodolfo's consent was unnecessary. Carmen petitioned the Supreme Court for review, but the Court dismissed the petition via a minute resolution "for lack of merit." Carmen filed a motion for reconsideration, contending that the Supreme Court failed to state the facts and law for the dismissal as required by the Constitution, and that the CA erred in failing to apply Art. 144 of the Civil Code regarding property relations in void marriages.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court is required to explain its denial of a petition for review of a Court of Appeals decision.
2. W/N the sale is void due to the lack of the "husband's" consent under Art. 144 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Petitions for review of Court of Appeals decisions are not a matter of right but of "sound judicial discretion." Resolutions denying such petitions are not "decisions" within the purview of Sec. 12, Art. VIII of the Constitution; thus, the Court need not fully explain the denial. Furthermore, courts are not required to decide every question of law raised by a party, specifically when such questions are immaterial to the litigation or raised merely to delay proceedings [1-3].

2. **NO.** The Court held that Art. 144 of the Civil Code (governing property of unmarried couples living together or those with void marriages as co-ownership) was immaterial. The CA impliedly found that at the time Carmen acquired the property, she and Rodolfo were not living together as husband and wife. Moreover, the Court established the principle that a wife cannot invoke her own fault or shortcoming—specifically her failure to get her husband's consent—to invalidate a sale she herself consummated. If the sale were defective, only Rodolfo's heirs would have the right to seek annulment, not Carmen [4-6].

The motion for reconsideration is DENIED [7].
