I. CAPTION
ISIDRO SORIENTE v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS and JUANITA DOMINGO, G.R. No. L-17343, August 31, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In 1912, Gregorio Domingo and Antonia Reyes, while lessees of a larger tract of land owned by the Compañia Agricola de Ultramar, constructed a house, a well, and water tanks. In 1918, the adjacent lot was purchased by Arturo Reyes. It was later discovered that the well, tanks, and part of the eaves of the Domingo house encroached upon Arturo Reyes' lot by approximately 24.90 square meters. The encroachment was tolerated, and the neighbors shared the water.

Respondent Juanita Domingo succeeded her parents (Gregorio and Antonia) in ownership of the improvements. Petitioner Isidro Soriente purchased the adjacent lot from the heirs of Arturo Reyes. Soriente demanded the removal of the encroachments. Domingo refused and filed an action to compel Soriente to reconvey the disputed portion or to pay for the improvements. The Trial Court, applying Article 361 of the old Civil Code, ruled that Soriente must either pay for the improvements or sell the land to Domingo. The Court of Appeals reversed this, applying equity and Article 1622 of the Civil Code, ordering Soriente to sell 143.40 square meters of his land to Domingo. Soriente appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Article 1622 of the Civil Code regarding the right of pre-emption applies to this case.
2. W/N the respondent is entitled to indemnity for the improvements or the right to compel the sale of the land as a builder in good faith.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Article 1622 grants a right of pre-emption only when the urban land is so small and so situated that a major portion cannot be used for any practical purpose, and was bought merely for speculation [1]. In this case, it was neither proved nor alleged that the land purchased by Soriente was useless for practical purposes or bought for speculation. Soriente established that the land was sufficient for his mechanical workshop and that he had no intention to resell it [1].

2. **NO.** The rights of the parties are governed by Articles 1573 and 487 of the Spanish Civil Code, which was in force in 1912 when the improvements were constructed [2]. Under these provisions, a lessee has no right to be indemnified for useful improvements; the lessee may only remove them if possible without injury to the property [3, 4]. Since Domingo's predecessors were mere lessees at the time of construction, she has no better right than they did and cannot compel Soriente to pay indemnity or sell the land [4]. The Court distinguished this from cases involving good faith errors in surveys or concrete structures, noting that Domingo's building was wooden and the encroachment was known [5, 6].

The decision of the Court of Appeals was affirmed with modification. The Supreme Court declared that Domingo is not entitled to compel a sale or claim indemnity. She was ordered to remove the water tanks and encroaching eaves and to pay rental for the use of the land until removal [7, 8].
