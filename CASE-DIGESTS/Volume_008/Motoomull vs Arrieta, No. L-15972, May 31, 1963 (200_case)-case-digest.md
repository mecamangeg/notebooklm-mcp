I. CAPTION
**CONCEPCION ASETRE MOTOOMULL v. HON. ABUNDIO Z. ARRIETA AND PILAR ASETRE GARCIA**, G.R. No. L-15972, May 31, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Pilar Asetre Garcia and her sister filed an action to quiet title against their sister, petitioner Concepcion Asetre Motoomull, over a 114-hectare coconut land in Misamis Oriental. Pilar claimed ownership via donation from their father, while Concepcion claimed she purchased the property. During the proceedings, Pilar filed a petition for receivership, alleging that under Concepcion’s possession, the land area had inexplicably reduced from 108 to 54 hectares, portions were being claimed by third parties, and the property was mortgaged to the Philippine National Bank with loans remaining unpaid despite Concepcion deriving considerable income from the produce, thus risking foreclosure. Respondent Judge Arrieta granted the receivership. Concepcion moved to lift the order by offering to file a bond to answer for damages, but the Judge denied the motion. Concepcion filed a petition for certiorari alleging grave abuse of discretion.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in placing the property under receivership and denying the offer to lift it via bond.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the respondent Judge acted with reasonableness and within his discretion. Under Section 1(b), Rule 61 of the Rules of Court, litigated property may be placed under receivership when the applicant has an interest in the property and it is in danger of being lost, removed, or materially injured. Pilar established a *prima facie* interest through a deed of donation. The danger of loss was established by the reduction of the land area, claims by third parties, and the risk of foreclosure due to unpaid mortgages.

Furthermore, the denial of Concepcion's offer to file a bond was proper. The Court held that damages would be difficult to prove, particularly regarding crops produced during continued possession, and a bond cannot satisfactorily compensate for the loss of the land itself should the mortgages be foreclosed. Distinguishing *Lacson v. Hodges*, where a bond was sufficient for a fixed monetary obligation, the risk here involved the total loss of the specific real property.

The writ prayed for is denied.
