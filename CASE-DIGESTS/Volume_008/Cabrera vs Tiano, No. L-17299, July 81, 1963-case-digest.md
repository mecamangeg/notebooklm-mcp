I. CAPTION
JOSEFINA POTESTAS CABRERA and CRESENCIA POTESTAS OMULON v. MARIANO T. TIANO, G.R. No. L-17299, July 31, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On July 2, 1947, Ciriaco Potestas and three of his children sold a parcel of land in Misamis Occidental to defendant Mariano T. Tiano. However, plaintiff Josefina Potestas Cabrera did not sign the deed of sale, and plaintiff Cresencia Potestas Omulon was a minor at the time [1]. On June 20, 1957, the plaintiffs filed an action for "Partition and Recovery of Real Estate, with Damages" against Tiano [2]. The summons was issued on June 21, 1957, but Tiano received it only on July 2, 1957 [3]. Tiano argued that the action had prescribed, claiming the ten-year period should be counted until the service of summons, not the filing of the complaint [4]. The Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring them entitled to their shares and damages. Tiano appealed directly to the Supreme Court [3, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the plaintiffs' action is barred by extinctive prescription.
2. W/N the defendant acquired ownership of the land through acquisitive prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The action is not barred. The Civil Code (Art. 1155) provides that the prescription of actions is interrupted when they are filed before the court [4]. The established rule under both Act No. 190 and the New Civil Code is that the commencement of the suit prior to the expiration of the limitation period interrupts the running of the statute as to all parties [6]. Civil actions are deemed commenced from the date of filing and docketing the complaint, regardless of the date of issuance and service of summons [6]. Since the sale occurred on July 2, 1947, and the complaint was filed on June 20, 1957, the ten-year prescriptive period had not yet elapsed [6].

2. **NO.** The defendant did not acquire ownership via acquisitive prescription. For acquisitive prescription to set in, possession must be with just title, in good faith, in the concept of an owner, public, peaceful, adverse, and uninterrupted (Arts. 1117 & 1118, Civil Code) [7]. Good faith is a question of fact that must be proved (Art. 1127, Civil Code) [7]. Since Tiano appealed directly to the Supreme Court, he is deemed to have waived questions of fact, and the trial court made no specific findings regarding the requisites of his possession [8]. Furthermore, when the summons was received on July 2, 1957, the ten-year period necessary for acquisitive prescription had not yet fully elapsed, as the period terminated on that very day [8].

Decision affirmed [9].
