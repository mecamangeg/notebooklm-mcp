I. CAPTION
COMPAÑIA GENERAL DE TABACOS DE FILIPINAS v. CITY OF MANILA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16619, June 29, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas (Tabacalera), a licensed liquor dealer, paid the City of Manila fixed license fees prescribed by Ordinance No. 3358 for the years 1954 to 1957. Simultaneously, it paid sales taxes on its wholesale and retail sales of "general merchandise" under Ordinances Nos. 3634, 3301, and 3816. The City Treasurer treated "liquor" as part of "general merchandise," prompting Tabacalera to include its liquor sales in its tax declarations. Tabacalera subsequently filed an action for a refund of P15,280.00, arguing that since it already paid the specific license fees for the privilege of selling liquor, it should not be subject to the sales tax on the same products, claiming this constituted double taxation and payment by mistake. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Tabacalera and ordered the refund. The City appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the imposition of both a license fee under Ordinance No. 3358 and a sales tax under Ordinances Nos. 3634, 3301, and 3816 on the same business constitutes invalid double taxation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the taxes were valid and distinct. A **license fee** is a legal concept distinct from a **tax**: the former is imposed in the exercise of police power for regulation, while the latter is imposed under the taxing power for raising revenue (*McQuillin, Municipal Corporations*). Ordinance No. 3358 imposes a license fee to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors, which can be harmful to public health and morals. In contrast, Ordinances Nos. 3634, 3301, and 3816 are revenue measures imposing taxes on sales of general merchandise. The term "merchandise" includes liquor and all subjects of commerce (*City of Manila vs. Inter-Island Gas Service, Inc.*).

The Court ruled that both a license fee and a tax may be imposed on the same business or for selling the same article without violating the rule against double taxation (*Bentley Gray Dry Goods Co. vs. City of Tampa*). Consequently, the decision of the lower court is **REVERSED** and the case is **DISMISSED**.
