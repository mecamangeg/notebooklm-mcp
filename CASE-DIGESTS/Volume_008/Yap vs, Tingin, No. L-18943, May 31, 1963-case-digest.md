I. CAPTION
RAMON YAP v. FORTUNATA TINGIN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18943, May 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Ramon Yap (plaintiff) and Fortunata Tingin et al. (defendants) were co-owners of a lot and house in Guagua, Pampanga. In an action for partition, the Court of First Instance rendered a decision on March 18, 1957, giving the defendants five days from notice to repurchase Yap’s 5/6 share by depositing the purchase price with the Clerk of Court [1, 2]. On March 23, 1957, Yap filed a motion seeking reimbursement for expenses paid to the partition commissioners [3].

On March 28, 1957, the defendants deposited P7,510.00 with the Clerk of Court, Amadeo Yuson. Yuson issued a temporary receipt because the regular cash officer was absent [4]. The official receipt was eventually issued on April 8, 1957 [5]. Yap argued that the deposit was late and ineffective, claiming the official date should be April 8, and sought to forfeit the defendants' right to repurchase [6, 7]. The trial court amended its decision on November 19, 1957 to include the reimbursement prayed for by Yap, effectively denying his plea to forfeit defendants' rights [7]. Yap appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court on a question of law [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defendants' deposit with the Clerk of Court using a temporary receipt constituted valid compliance with the court's order.
2. W/N Yap’s motion for reimbursement suspended the finality of the March 18, 1957 decision.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the defendants substantially complied with the court's order by depositing the required amount with the Clerk of Court within the stated period [8]. The fact that the Clerk issued only a temporary receipt to safeguard his own accountability due to the cash officer's absence did not alter the fact that the defendants took all necessary steps to comply [8]. The Court rejected Yap's contention as "too technical and narrow" [8].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that Yap’s motion of March 23, 1957, was in effect a motion for reconsideration and amendment because it prayed for relief (reimbursement) not included in the original decision [9]. Consequently, this motion suspended the finality of the decision [9]. Since the court did not act on the motion until November 19, 1957, the decision had not yet become final when the defendants made their deposit—whether reckoned on March 28 or April 8 [10]. Thus, the deposit was made on time [10].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [11].
