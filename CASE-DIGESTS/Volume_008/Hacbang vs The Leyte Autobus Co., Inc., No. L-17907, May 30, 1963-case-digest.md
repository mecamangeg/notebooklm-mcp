I. CAPTION
JOAQUIN HACBANG, et al. v. THE LEYTE AUTOBUS COMPANY, INC. and HON. CLEMENTINO V. DIEZ, G.R. No. L-17907, May 30, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In Civil Case No. 2045, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte rendered a judgment ordering Leyte Autobus Co., Inc. (defendant) to pay Otilla Bustillo and her children a sum of money, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals [1]. Pursuant to a writ of execution, petitioners Joaquin Hacbang and Castor Bardelosa, as Provincial Sheriffs of Leyte, levied upon a passenger bus belonging to the defendant [1]. Leyte Autobus Co., Inc. filed a third-party claim alleging it was a different entity from the judgment debtor, but the CFI of Leyte dismissed the claim and ordered the auction sale [1, 2].

On the date of the auction, the company filed a separate action (Civil Case No. R-6542) in the CFI of Cebu against the sheriffs, seeking to enjoin the sale [3]. Respondent Judge Diez of the CFI of Cebu issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the sheriffs from proceeding with the execution sale ordered by the CFI of Leyte [4]. The sheriffs' motion to dismiss based on lack of jurisdiction was denied, prompting this petition for certiorari and prohibition [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CFI of Cebu has jurisdiction to issue a writ of injunction restraining the execution of a judgment rendered by the CFI of Leyte, a court of concurrent jurisdiction.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the CFI of Cebu acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction.

First, the levy on the bus brought the property into *custodia legis* under the sole control of the CFI of Leyte, the court issuing the writ [6]. A court that has control of such property exercises exclusive jurisdiction over it, and no other court, except one with supervisory power, has the right to interfere [6].

Second, it is settled that no court has the power to interfere by injunction with the judgments or decrees of a court of concurrent or coordinate jurisdiction [7]. Allowing coordinate courts to interfere with each other would lead to confusion and hinder the administration of justice [8].

Third, the jurisdiction of a CFI to restrain acts is limited to those committed within its territorial boundaries [9]. The CFI of Cebu has no authority to restrain the performance of acts (the execution sale) outside the Province of Cebu [9]. While the respondent company may vindicate its claim of ownership in a separate action, it cannot stop the execution ordered by a coordinate court [10].

The petition is granted; the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the respondent Judge is set aside and annulled, and the writ issued by the Supreme Court is made permanent [11].
