**I. CAPTION**
PHILIPPINE MANUFACTURING COMPANY v. ANG BISIG NG PMC, ALBERTO TEODORO, and ALEJANDRO JOAQUIN, G.R. No. L-18091, June 29, 1963, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
From 1947 to 1953, the Philippine Manufacturing Company (PMC) and the respondent union, Ang Bisig ng PMC, agreed on a shift schedule where the third shift ran from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. the following day. In 1955, the union filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) demanding 50% additional compensation for work performed between 12:01 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. whenever that period fell on a Sunday or legal holiday. PMC argued that per their agreement, the workday starting at 7:00 a.m. included the early morning hours of the following day, meaning Sunday mornings were part of the Saturday workday and not subject to extra pay.

The CIR ruled in favor of the union, ordering PMC to pay the 50% additional compensation. PMC filed a motion for reconsideration requesting oral argument, which the CIR *en banc* denied without a hearing. PMC appealed, alleging denial of due process and arguing that the ruling invalidated their shift agreement.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the CIR denied PMC due process by refusing to hear the motion for reconsideration in oral argument and allegedly failing to "sit together" as a court *en banc*.
2. W/N the employees are entitled to additional compensation for work done from 12:01 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. on Sundays and legal holidays despite the agreed shift schedule.
3. W/N the CIR correctly awarded 50% additional compensation instead of the statutory 25%.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The hearing of a motion for reconsideration in oral argument is a matter of sound discretion for the CIR. Its refusal does not constitute a denial of due process absent a showing of abuse of discretion [1]. Furthermore, the requirement that judges "sit together" does not require physical presence in one room for deliberation; it is sufficient that all available judges take part in the resolution. The fact that they signed the resolution implies they engaged in consultation [2], [3].

2. **YES.** While the parties validly agreed on the shift hours, the compensation for work done during Sundays and legal holidays is governed by law, not by the agreement. Section 6 of the Eight-Hour Labor Law (Commonwealth Act No. 444) renders null and void any agreement contrary to its provisions [4]. The CIR did not invalidate the shift agreement but merely enforced the law requiring extra pay for Sunday and holiday work, regardless of whether the shift started the previous day [5].

3. **YES.** Although Section 4 of the Eight-Hour Labor Law mandates a minimum of 25% additional compensation, the CIR is authorized to order payment of 50% if such rate is in line with the company's practice and the parties' collective bargaining agreement, as was found in this case [6], [7], [8].

The decision and resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations are **AFFIRMED**.
