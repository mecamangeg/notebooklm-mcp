**I. CAPTION**
SILVER SWAN MANUFACTURING COMPANY, INC. v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS and COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-17435, June 29, 1963, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 7, 1957, Silver Swan applied for tax exemption under Republic Act No. 901 as a manufacturer of soy sauce. The application was initially disapproved. On August 27, 1957, Silver Swan sought reconsideration. Based on new representations in this request, the Secretary of Finance granted the exemption on October 15, 1957, specifically stating it would commence on August 27, 1957 (the date of the reconsideration request).

Between March and September 1957, Silver Swan imported raw materials and paid the corresponding duties. On October 28, 1958, it filed a claim for refund of duties paid prior to August 27, 1957, arguing that under Section 4 of R.A. No. 901, the exemption should retroact to the date of the *original* application (February 7). The refund was denied administratively. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) dismissed Silver Swan's subsequent petition on the ground of failure to exhaust administrative remedies, ruling that Silver Swan failed to file a written protest at the time of payment as required by Section 1370 of the Revised Administrative Code.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N a written protest under Section 1370 of the Revised Administrative Code is required to claim the refund.
2. W/N the Secretary of Finance validly limited the tax exemption's retroactivity to the date of the request for reconsideration rather than the original application.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that the protest required by Section 1370 of the Revised Administrative Code (now Sec. 2308 of the Tariff and Customs Code) applies to challenges against rulings on liability for duties determined at the time of collection. It cannot apply where the ground for the refund—tax exemption—did not exist at the time the duties were paid. A protest could not be required for a right that had not yet come into existence.

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the Secretary of Finance did not violate Section 4 of R.A. No. 901. The grant of exemption was based on "new facts" and "representations" contained in the August 27, 1957 request for reconsideration, which induced the Secretary to treat it as a *new* application. Therefore, setting the commencement date to August 27, 1957, rather than the original filing on February 7, was within the Secretary's authority and consistent with the law providing that benefits retroact to the date of filing.

**Resolution affirmed with modification.**
