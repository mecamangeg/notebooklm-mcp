I. CAPTION
AMANDO LITAO v. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF RETIRED CIVIL EMPLOYEES, No. L-18998, July 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On June 19, 1953, Amando Litao (lessee) and the National Association of Retired Civil Employees (lessor) entered into a lease contract for the ground floor of the lessor's building in Olongapo [1]. The contract stipulated that Litao would convert the premises into a 5-door accessoria at his own expense [2]. In return, the lessor would reimburse Litao by offsetting the expenses against the monthly rental of P100.00 until fully satisfied [2].

Litao spent P14,783.95 on improvements but was only reimbursed P6,000.00 [3]. Claiming an unpaid balance of P8,783.95, Litao sought an extension of the lease term until full reimbursement, as per his interpretation of the contract [4]. The Association, however, notified Litao of the lease expiration on June 30, 1958, and demanded he surrender the premises, notifying sub-lessees to pay rentals directly to the Association [4]. Litao filed a complaint for specific performance and damages in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zambales [4]. The CFI dismissed the complaint for specific performance and ordered the Association to pay the balance due [5]. Litao appealed, arguing the lease should be extended [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lessor may terminate the lease by paying the outstanding balance of the lessee's expenses in cash rather than extending the lease term.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while the contract implied an automatic extension of the lease to allow for reimbursement through rental offsets, this stipulation was **exclusively for the benefit of the lessor** [7, 8]. Its purpose was to save the lessor the trouble of making a cash reimbursement [8]. Consequently, the lessor has the discretion to waive this benefit and terminate the lease upon the expiration of the original period, or anytime thereafter, by tendering or consigning in court the outstanding balance of the lessee's expenditures [8].

The lessor, however, cannot terminate the lease and retake possession while delaying repayment, as this would deprive the lessee of his stipulated security [9]. Thus, the lessor has the option to either: (1) reimburse the balance immediately and demand an accounting of fruits/income received by the lessee since the lease expiration; or (2) require the lessee to apply such income to the payment of the balance, turning over any excess to the lessor [10].

The judgment was modified, and the records were remanded for accounting [10].
