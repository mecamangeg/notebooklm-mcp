**I. CAPTION**
INSULAR SUGAR REFINING CORPORATION v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and INSUREFCO & PAPER PULP PROJECT WORKERS UNION, G.R. No. L-19247, May 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
On November 18, 1955, the respondent Union moved to reopen a case in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), seeking the reinstatement of 39 workers allegedly illegally dismissed by the "old" Insular Sugar Refining Corporation. Years later, on April 28, 1961, the Union moved to implead the Philippine Sugar Institute (PHILSUGIN) and the petitioner, the "new" Insular Sugar Refining Corporation ("new INSUREFCO"), as additional parties [1].

The new INSUREFCO had purchased the refinery business. Clause XI of the contract of sale stipulated that the new INSUREFCO would retain only such personnel as it determined necessary and would not be liable for claims arising from the previous employer-employee relationship with PHILSUGIN [2]. The new INSUREFCO contested the CIR's jurisdiction, arguing it had no employer-employee relationship with the dismissed workers. The CIR overruled this objection in an order dated October 10, 1961, prompting the new INSUREFCO to file this petition for certiorari [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction to compel the new INSUREFCO (vendee) to reinstate employees dismissed by the former owner.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the CIR lacks jurisdiction over the new INSUREFCO because it cannot compel the vendee of a business to reinstate employees with whom it had no previous employer-employee relationship [4, 5]. The two corporations are admittedly distinct, and there was no allegation that the sale was fictitious to evade liability [5].

The Court ruled that mere knowledge by the vendee of a pending labor case between the vendor and the Union does not make the vendee an accomplice in an unfair labor practice [4]. Under the contract of sale, the new INSUREFCO had the discretion to retain only the personnel it deemed necessary. Even if the workers were found to be illegally dismissed by the old corporation, their claim against the new INSUREFCO would be limited to separation pay under the contract. Such a demand constitutes a "pure money claim" not connected to any unfair labor practice or violation of the Eight-Hour Labor Law or Minimum Wage Act, and therefore must be prosecuted in the regular courts (Courts of First Instance), not the CIR [5, 6].

The petition was granted, and the CIR order was set aside [7].
