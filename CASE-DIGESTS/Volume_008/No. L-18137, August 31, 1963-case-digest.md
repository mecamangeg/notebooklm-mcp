**I. CAPTION**
ROSELLER T. LIM, ET AL. v. PACITA DE LOS SANTOS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18137, August 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners (Lim, et al.) purchased subdivision lots in Quezon City from respondents (De los Santos, et al.) on installment. Petitioners alleged that respondents represented they would construct adequate roads and outlets, but failed to do so, rendering the lots inaccessible and uninhabitable. They filed a complaint for specific performance and damages. Respondents filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing the complaint failed to state a cause of action because the written contracts did not stipulate the construction of roads, and that petitioners lacked the capacity to sue under Quezon City Ordinance No. 2969.

The trial court sustained the Motion to Dismiss. Upon petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration, the trial court held a hearing to receive evidence regarding the alleged verbal promises. Finding the promises were not in the written agreements and were denied by defendants, the court denied the reconsideration.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the complaint states a cause of action despite the written contract not explicitly mentioning the obligation to construct roads.
2. W/N the taking of evidence during the Motion for Reconsideration of the dismissal order was proper.
3. W/N the petitioners have the personality to sue to enforce the Urban Planning Regulations and Quezon City Ordinance No. 2969.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** A Motion to Dismiss based on failure to state a cause of action admits the truth of the facts averred in the complaint [1]. The complaint specifically alleged that the defendant represented she would construct adequate outlets [2]. The trial court erred in applying the Parol Evidence Rule at this stage; this rule is one of evidence for the merits of the case and cannot be invoked to test the legal sufficiency of the complaint [3]. Furthermore, a seller has a legal duty to deliver the thing sold in a condition suitable for enjoyment, and Urban Planning Regulations required subdivision owners to construct paved roadways [3, 4].

2. **NO.** The taking of evidence upon the Motion for Reconsideration was an irregular procedure not authorized by the rules [5]. In a Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, no evidence may be alleged or considered except the facts pleaded in the complaint. The judge may not inquire into the truth of allegations before a hearing on the merits [5].

3. **YES.** Unlike in the case of *Subido v. City of Manila*, where a private citizen lacked standing to contest an ordinance without special injury, the petitioners here suffer a special injury as lot purchasers due to the absence of roads, distinct from the damage to the community at large [6]. Thus, they have the personality to compel compliance with the regulations.

**Disposition:** The order of dismissal is set aside, and the records are ordered remanded for further proceedings conformable to law [7].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred. Justice Bautista Angelo took no part.
