**I. CAPTION**
**EUGENIO URBAYAN and PATROCENIA MERCADO URBAYAN v. EVARISTO SALVORO**, G.R. No. L-16774, May 30, 1963, Padilla, J.

**II. FACTS**
On January 12, 1954, spouses Eugenio and Patrocenia Urbayan filed a complaint in the Municipal Court of Tacloban against Evaristo Salvoro for the rescission of a lease contract and the recovery of compensatory and moral damages totaling P2,225, plus daily losses of P31 and P500 in attorney's fees [1]. Salvoro filed an amended answer seeking the dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the Municipal Court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter, but the court denied the dismissal and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs [2, 3].

Salvoro appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte. In his answer filed with the CFI, he reiterated the affirmative defense that the Municipal Court lacked original jurisdiction [4]. The CFI proceeded with the trial and rendered judgment declaring the lease rescinded and ordering Salvoro to pay P3,000 in damages and P500 in attorney's fees [4]. Salvoro appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved a question of jurisdiction [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Municipal Court had jurisdiction over the action for rescission and damages.
2. W/N the defendant waived his objection to the jurisdiction of the lower court by appealing to the Court of First Instance.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Municipal Court lacked jurisdiction. Under Section 88 of Republic Act No. 296 (The Judiciary Act of 1948), an action for the rescission of a lease contract and recovery of damages exceeding P2,000 is clearly beyond the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court [5]. Therefore, the judgment rendered by the Municipal Court of Tacloban was a nullity [5].

2. **NO.** The defendant did not waive the objection. Since Salvoro explicitly raised the point of lack of jurisdiction in his answer filed with the CFI, he cannot be deemed to have consented to the exercise of the CFI's original jurisdiction [5]. The only jurisdiction the CFI possessed was to dismiss the action. Consequently, the judgment rendered by the CFI, in spite of the objection to the original jurisdiction of the Municipal Court and the appellate jurisdiction of the CFI, is a patent nullity [5].

The judgment appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the complaint **DISMISSED**.
