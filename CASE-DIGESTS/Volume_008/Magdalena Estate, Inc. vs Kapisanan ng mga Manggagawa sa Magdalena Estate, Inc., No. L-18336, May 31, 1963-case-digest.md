I. CAPTION
MAGDALENA ESTATE, INC., WILLIAM A. YOTOKO and FELIPE BENABAYE v. KAPISANAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA SA MAGDALENA ESTATE, INC., G.R. No. L-18336, May 31, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Union filed a complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP) against petitioner Magdalena Estate, Inc. The Union alleged that the company required its members to sign application forms that would convert their employment status to a temporary basis, removable at the company's pleasure. When the members refused to sign, the company dismissed 19 employees.

The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) trial judge declared the company guilty of ULP but ordered the reinstatement of only the four (4) employees who testified during the hearing. For the remaining 15 who did not testify, the judge merely suggested they be given a chance to work if vacancies arose. On motion for reconsideration, the CIR *en banc* issued a resolution extending the relief of reinstatement with full back wages to all 19 dismissed employees, finding that the testimony of the four covered the others. Petitioners appealed, arguing that the relief could not extend to those who did not appear and testify, contending the case was not a class suit.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR erred in extending the relief of reinstatement and back wages to the 15 employees who did not testify at the trial.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the CIR resolution. Under Commonwealth Act No. 103, the CIR is not bound by technical rules of evidence and may inform its mind as it deems just and equitable. The Court held that the complaint substantially complied with the requirements of a class suit under Section 12, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court. The complaint was filed by the Union on behalf of its members, and the subject matter—reinstatement due to a common cause of action (refusal to sign the new forms)—was of general interest to all.

The Court distinguished this from *Dimayuga v. CIR*, noting that the present case was a ULP case filed by the Union where no warning was given that individual testimony was required. Consequently, the testimony of the four employees regarding the company's discriminatory acts (dismissal for union activities and refusal to sign the forms) benefited the other 15 similarly situated employees. The company's defense of a "retrenchment policy" was rejected as the policy was implemented exclusively in the department where the union existed.

Petition granted; CIR resolution affirmed.
