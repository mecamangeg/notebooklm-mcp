I. CAPTION
BATANGAS TRANSPORTATION COMPANY v. NARCISO VALENZUELA and THE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-18532, August 31, 1963, Paredes, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Respondent Valenzuela, employed as a driver by petitioner, was injured on November 17, 1958, when he was pinned against a wall by a truck while fixing a spare tire [2]. He filed a claim for compensation, asserting total disability from the date of the accident until June 11, 1959, supported by a medical certificate (Exhibit "A") from Manila Sanitarium [3], [4]. Petitioner opposed, arguing the disability lasted only 3-4 weeks based on an initial Physician's Report [5], [3]. The Hearing Officer ruled in favor of Valenzuela, admitting Exhibit "A" over petitioner's hearsay objection [4], [6]. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed the findings on disability but modified the decision by awarding attorney's fees *motu proprio*, even though Valenzuela had not appealed the Hearing Officer's failure to award them [7]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the admissibility of the hearsay evidence and the propriety of the unappealed award of attorney's fees [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the WCC erred in admitting a hearsay medical certificate to establish the duration of disability.
2. W/N the WCC can award attorney's fees *motu proprio* when the claimant did not appeal their non-award.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The admission was proper under the Workmen's Compensation Act. Section 49 of the Act allows the Commission to receive "hospital records in relation to the case" as proof, relaxing the strict rules of evidence regarding hearsay [9]. The Court held that the duration of disability is a finding of fact conclusive upon the Supreme Court when supported by substantial evidence [9]. The Commission correctly disregarded the initial 3-4 week estimate in the Physician's Report, as the gravity of the injury clearly necessitated a longer period of medication and treatment [9], [10].

2. **NO.** The lack of an appeal on this point is no obstacle. Both the Workmen's Compensation Act (Sec. 6, Rule 26) and the New Civil Code (Art. 2208[4]) authorize attorney's fees [10]. The Court ruled that attorney's fees are included in the concept of actual damages and may be awarded by an appellate court *motu proprio* whenever deemed just and equitable, even if the party did not specifically appeal their non-award [10], [11].

Decision affirmed [11].
