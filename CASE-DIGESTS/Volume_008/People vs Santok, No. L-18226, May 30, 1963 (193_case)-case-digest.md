I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FLORENCIO SANTOK, G.R. No. L-18226, May 30, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On January 19, 1952, Amando Fabul, a barrio lieutenant, attempted to pacify a quarrel near a cockpit in Laiya, San Juan, Batangas [1]. While performing this duty, he was shot in the umbilical region and died shortly thereafter [1]. Prosecution witnesses, including the school principal Jose Trillanes and the victim's sister, positively identified the accused, Florencio Santok, as the shooter [2]. The victim's widow also testified that her husband identified Santok as the assailant in an *ante-mortem* statement [2]. Santok raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was 22 kilometers away, and argued that the victim was unconscious and could not have identified him [3]. The Court of First Instance of Batangas convicted Santok of murder and sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty of 12 to 20 years [4]. The Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court, believing the proper penalty should be life imprisonment [1].

III. ISSUES
1. W/N Santok is the author of the crime.
2. W/N the killing is qualified to murder by evident premeditation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that Santok's alibi was without factual foundation [5]. It was refuted by a prior affidavit where he admitted being in Laiya at the time [6]. Furthermore, expert medical testimony established that the victim could have retained consciousness and speech to identify his assailant, contrary to the defense's claim [7]. Ballistic evidence also proved the fatal slug came from a .45 caliber pistol similar to Santok's, and not from the different weapons carried by nearby civilian guards [8].

2. **NO.** The Court held that Santok is guilty merely of **Homicide**, not Murder [9]. Evident premeditation cannot qualify the killing to murder because the presence of the deceased at the scene could not have been anticipated by the defendant [9]. However, the crime was attended by the aggravating circumstance of **contempt of public authority**, as the victim was a barrio lieutenant killed while performing his official duties [9, 10]. Since the penalty originally imposed by the trial court (12 to 20 years) falls within the maximum range imposable for homicide with this aggravating circumstance, the decision was affirmed [9].
