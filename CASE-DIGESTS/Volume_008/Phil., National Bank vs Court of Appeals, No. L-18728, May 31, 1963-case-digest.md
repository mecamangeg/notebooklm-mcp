**I. CAPTION**
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18728, May 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Philippine National Bank (PNB) filed a collection suit against Raymundo Vargas in the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription [1]. PNB filed a notice of appeal and record on appeal, explicitly stating its intention to appeal directly to the Supreme Court on purely questions of law [2, 3]. However, PNB failed to file the appeal bond on time, leading the trial court to deny the appeal [4].

PNB filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Court of Appeals (CA) to compel the trial court to give due course to the appeal. The CA dismissed the petition, ruling it had no jurisdiction because PNB's appeal was directed to the Supreme Court, not the CA [2, 3]. PNB argued that even if filed erroneously, the CA should have certified the case to the Supreme Court under Section 31 of the Judiciary Act of 1948 [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus in a case where the appeal is expressly directed to the Supreme Court.
2. W/N the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the petition instead of transferring it to the Supreme Court.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that under Section 30 of Republic Act 296 (Judiciary Act of 1948), the Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus only when "in aid of its appellate jurisdiction" [6, 7]. Since PNB unequivocally manifested its intention to appeal directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law, the main case would not fall under the CA's exclusive appellate jurisdiction [8]. Consequently, the CA correctly ruled it lacked jurisdiction to act on the petition as it was not in aid of its own appellate functions [8].

2. **NO.** The Court rejected PNB's argument regarding certification. Section 31 of the Judiciary Act of 1948 applies only to cases that are "erroneously appealed," and does not extend to special civil actions (like certiorari or mandamus) that are originally filed with the improper appellate court [5].

Petition denied [9].
