I. CAPTION
HARRISON FOUNDRY & MACHINERY and ALFONSO CHUA v. HARRISON FOUNDRY WORKERS' ASSOCIATION, FELIPE NUFABLE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18432, June 29, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Harrison Foundry & Machinery dismissed eight union officials on May 24, 1958, prompting 49 other employees (respondents) to stage a strike. In previous cases (Case Nos. 1696-ULP and 1708-ULP), the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) *en banc* declared the strike justified and ordered the reinstatement of the eight officials with backwages but was silent regarding the 49 strikers. This resolution became final.

When the 49 strikers presented themselves for work, petitioners refused to readmit them. Consequently, the strikers filed new cases (Case No. 1290-V and Case No. 2255-ULP) for reinstatement with backwages and unfair labor practice. Petitioners filed motions to dismiss these new cases on the ground of *res judicata*, arguing the matter was settled in the previous cases. The CIR denied the motions to dismiss. Petitioners appealed this denial via certiorari.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the order denying the motion to dismiss is appealable.
2. W/N the new cases filed by the strikers are barred by *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** An order denying a motion to dismiss is interlocutory and non-appealable because it does not terminate the proceedings nor finally dispose of the contentions of the parties. The proper remedy is not to appeal the order of denial but to interpose the defenses in the answer, proceed to trial, and appeal from the adverse decision in due time. A writ of certiorari cannot substitute for an appeal. The Court noted that piecemeal resort to higher courts is discouraged as it delays the speedy disposition of cases.

2. **NO.** The defense of *res judicata* will not lie. The issues in the previous cases were limited to the dismissal of the eight union officials and the legality of the strike. The readmission of the 49 strikers could not have been ordered therein because the strike, being legal, did not terminate the employer-employee relationship. No question of readmission arose until the strike was declared lawful and the employer subsequently refused to readmit the strikers. This refusal constituted a separate and new cause of action for unfair labor practice, which is the subject of the present litigation.

Orders affirmed.
