I. CAPTION
THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE LA LOMA CATHOLIC CEMETERY v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and the LA LOMA CATHOLIC CEMETERY FREE WORKERS (FFW), G.R. No. L-13365, July 31, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On November 21, 1956, the La Loma Catholic Cemetery Free Workers (FFW) filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to be certified as the exclusive bargaining representative for the employees of the La Loma Catholic Cemetery [1]. The Superintendent of the Cemetery moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that the Cemetery is a religious temporality and a non-profit enterprise, and thus its employees are not covered by the Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act No. 875) [2]. The CIR denied the motion and certified the union, ruling that the Cemetery was operated for profit because it derived income from the sale of lots, lease of niches, and registration of dead bodies [3, 4]. The Superintendent appealed to the Supreme Court, presenting evidence that the Cemetery is maintained by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila for the religious objective of burying the dead according to Catholic rites, and that its income is dedicated to maintenance and does not inure to private individuals [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the La Loma Catholic Cemetery is a profit-making enterprise subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations under Republic Act No. 875. [7]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CIR's resolution. The Court held that the Cemetery is a purely religious temporality and a non-profit enterprise [8]. The fact that income is derived from the sale of lots and lease of niches does not necessarily make it a profit-making organization, as there was no evidence that any profit inured to the benefit of private individuals or that there were monetary profits after deducting maintenance expenses [6, 9]. The Court applied the doctrine laid down in *Boy Scouts of the Philippines v. Araos* (L-10091), which established that employees and laborers in non-profit organizations are not covered by the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. 875), and consequently, the CIR has no jurisdiction to entertain petitions for certification election from such unions [8].

The resolution and order appealed from are reversed and the case is dismissed [10].
