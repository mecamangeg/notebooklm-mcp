**I. CAPTION**
**ISHAR SINGH v. LIBERTY INSURANCE CORPORATION**, G.R. No. L-16860, July 31, 1963, Dizon, J. [1]

**II. FACTS**
Ishar Singh filed a suit in the Municipal Court of Manila to recover P1,000.00 from Liberty Insurance Corporation (Liberty) under a fidelity bond executed by Leonardo Anne as principal and Liberty as surety [2]. The Municipal Court rendered judgment ordering Liberty to pay Singh and sentencing the third-party defendants (Anne, et al.) to indemnify Liberty for whatever amount it paid Singh [3]. Only the third-party defendants appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) [3]. Liberty did not appeal but subsequently filed an answer in the CFI [4]. Singh filed a motion to strike out Liberty's answer, arguing that the decision of the Municipal Court had become final and executory with respect to Liberty for its failure to appeal [4]. The CFI granted the motion and ordered the execution of the judgment against Liberty [4]. Liberty appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the appeal taken by the third-party defendants inured to its benefit and vacated the decision of the Municipal Court, requiring a trial *de novo* for all parties [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the appeal taken by the third-party defendants vacated the judgment of the Municipal Court against the defendant who did not appeal. [5], [6]

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the orders of the lower court [7]. While an appeal from a decision of an inferior court operates to vacate said decision and stands the case for trial *de novo* in the CFI, this rule applies only to the party who took the appeal [6]. As against other parties adversely affected by the decision who did not appeal, the decision must be deemed to have become final and executory [6]. The Court distinguished this case from *Arambulo v. Court of Appeals*, where the plaintiffs were the ones who appealed, which necessarily reopened the whole case to determine who among the defendants was liable [8], [9]. Here, Liberty simply failed to appeal the adverse judgment. Consequently, Liberty had no right to file an answer in the CFI regarding the complaint, although it remained an active party in the appeal solely as the third-party plaintiff (appellee) regarding the third-party defendants' appeal [9].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Paredes, Regala, and Makalintal concurred [7]. Justice Barrera reserved his vote, while Chief Justice Bengzon and Justice Padilla took no part [7].
