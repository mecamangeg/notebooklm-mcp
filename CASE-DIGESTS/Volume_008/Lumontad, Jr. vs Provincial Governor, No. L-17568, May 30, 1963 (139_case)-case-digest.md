I. CAPTION
EMILIO M. LUMONTAD, JR. v. PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR, PROVINCIAL BOARD, et al., G.R. No. L-17568, May 30, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lumontad, the Municipal Mayor of Pinamungajan, Cebu, faced an administrative complaint filed by the Vice-Mayor and municipal councilors before the respondent Provincial Governor and Provincial Board [1]. The complaint charged him with violating Republic Act No. 917 by disbursing the Highway Special Fund (P7,270.42) without the Municipal Council's consultation or approved program of work [1, 2]. He was further charged with using public funds to reconstruct a public building for use as his personal residence and paying "camineros" to work in his office [2].

Lumontad filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu to stop the investigation [3]. He argued that under Section 12 of R.A. 917, irregularities in the disposal of the Highway Special Fund fall under the exclusive authority of the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, depriving the Provincial Governor of jurisdiction [4, 5]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the charges fell within the Provincial Governor's supervisory authority under the Revised Administrative Code [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Provincial Governor and Provincial Board have jurisdiction to investigate administrative charges against a municipal mayor regarding the alleged misuse of the Highway Special Fund under R.A. 917.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the Provincial Governor has jurisdiction [7].

The Court reasoned that while Section 12 of R.A. 917 empowers the Secretary of Public Works to withhold aid if funds are misused, it does not regulate the administrative discipline of officials who violate the Act [5, 8]. Nothing in R.A. 917 is inconsistent with the supervisory authority of the Provincial Governor under Section 2188 of the Revised Administrative Code to investigate "neglect of duty, oppression, corruption or other form of maladministration of office" [8, 9].

Under Section 2194 of the Revised Administrative Code, the Mayor has the duty to see that laws are faithfully executed [10]. By allegedly depriving the Municipal Council of its authority to designate roads for the fund under R.A. 917, and by using public funds for personal benefits (residence and office staff), the petitioner committed acts that may constitute neglect of duty, corruption, or maladministration, which are properly cognizable by the Provincial Governor [10, 11].

The decision appealed from was affirmed [7].
