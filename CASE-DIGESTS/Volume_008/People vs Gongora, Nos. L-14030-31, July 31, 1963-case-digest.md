I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ANTONIO GONGORA, ET AL., defendants; ESTANISLAO LLURCA, defendant-appellant, G.R. Nos. L-14030-31, July 31, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of June 24, 1957, Epifanio Boncag and his sweetheart, Isabel Cortez, were intimate near a cemetery in St. Bernard, Leyte. While Boncag was dressing, he was suddenly attacked and stabbed by a man he did not recognize in the dark. Boncag fled and lost consciousness at his home. The following morning, Isabel’s lifeless body was found in a brook near the abandoned house of the family of the accused, Estanislao Llurca. A bloody "Johnny Best Quality" undershirt was found hanging in Llurca's abandoned house.

During the investigation, police found a bloodstain under Llurca’s thumbnail, which a doctor confirmed was human blood despite Llurca's claim it was from a pig or fish. Co-accused Antonio Gongora, who was discharged to become a state witness, testified that he met Llurca that night. Llurca borrowed Gongora’s bolo, claiming he was going to a haunted place. Gongora followed and witnessed Llurca chase a woman (Isabel) to the abandoned house, where Gongora heard her pleading before she died.

The Court of First Instance of Leyte consolidated the cases for Murder (Isabel) and Frustrated Murder (Boncag). It convicted Llurca of both crimes, sentencing him to life imprisonment for the murder and an indeterminate sentence for the frustrated murder. Llurca appealed, alleging alibi and challenging the credibility of Gongora.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the circumstantial evidence and the testimony of the discharged state witness are sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
2. W/N the aggravating circumstance of nighttime should be appreciated separately from treachery in the frustrated murder case.
3. W/N the accused is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of intoxication.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the guilt of the appellant was established beyond a scintilla of doubt by three vital considerations unexplained by the defense: (1) the bloody undershirt found in his family's abandoned house, which fit him and matched the brand he wore; (2) the human bloodstain found under his thumbnail, regarding which he gave contradictory explanations; and (3) the presence of motive on his part (jealousy as a former suitor) contrasted with the lack of motive for the state witness Gongora [1], [2]. While the testimony of a co-accused turned state witness must be received with great caution, Gongora’s account was substantially corroborated by these physical circumstances [3], [4]. The defense of alibi was rejected as weak and the attempt to shift blame to Gongora through a child witness was deemed incredible [5], [6].

2. **NO.** In the frustrated murder case, where the attack was sudden, unexpected, and therefore treacherous, the aggravating circumstance of nighttime is absorbed in treachery and cannot be considered separately to increase the penalty [7], [8].

3. **YES.** The Court granted the mitigating circumstance of intoxication because the lower court found the appellant was under the influence of liquor immediately preceding the incident, and there was no evidence he was a habitual drunkard [9], [7].

**Disposition:** The judgment is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. For the frustrated murder charge, considering the mitigating circumstances of intoxication and passion or obfuscation without aggravating circumstances, the penalty is reduced to an indeterminate term of 4 months and 1 day of *arresto mayor* to 4 years, 2 months and 1 day of *prision correccional*.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**J.B.L. Reyes, J.**, concurred with the decision but disagreed regarding the appreciation of the mitigating circumstance of passion and obfuscation.
