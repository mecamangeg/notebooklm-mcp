**I. CAPTION**
MANILA YACHT CLUB, INC. v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and RAMON LAGAO, G.R. No. L-19258, May 31, 1963, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
Ramon Lagao, a marine engineer and mechanic employed by petitioner Manila Yacht Club, Inc., contracted tuberculosis due to the nature of his employment. He filed a claim with Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor, which ordered the petitioner to pay compensation. While the case was pending review before the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC), the petitioner filed a "Motion to Dismiss Claim and/or for Rehearing." The petitioner argued that being a non-profit, non-stock corporation not engaged in trade for gain, it was not covered by the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 3428), and thus the WCC lacked jurisdiction. The WCC denied the motion and affirmed the decision ordering payment. The petitioner appealed, contending that the lack of jurisdiction could be raised at any stage.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the defense that an employer is a non-profit organization not covered by the Workmen's Compensation Act is a jurisdictional question that may be raised for the first time on appeal.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that while the existence of an employer-employee relationship is a jurisdictional foundation, the non-applicability of the Workmen's Compensation Act to a specific employer (because the establishment is not for gain or has capital less than P10,000) is a matter of **defense**. Relying on *Rolan v. Perez*, the Court held that such exemptions are defenses favorable to the employer, and the burden is upon the employer to establish them. Consequently, this defense must be raised at the earliest opportunity. Since the petitioner failed to raise the non-applicability of the law during the trials before the Chief Hearing Officer, the defense was deemed waived.

Petition dismissed.
