I. CAPTION
PASTOR B. CONSTANTINO and PASTOR CONSTANTINO, JR. v. HON. ANDRES REYES, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, and HERMINIA ESPIRITU, G.R. No. L-16853, June 29, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pastor B. Constantino filed a complaint against Respondent Herminia Espiritu, alleging he conveyed a property to her via a fictitious deed of sale to hold in trust for their unborn illegitimate son, Pastor Constantino, Jr. He sought to compel her to execute a deed of conveyance to the son. Espiritu moved to dismiss on the grounds that the beneficiary (the son) was not a party and the action was unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds.

The respondent Judge dismissed the complaint on January 8, 1960. Petitioner received the notice on January 11 and filed a motion to admit an amended complaint (including the son as plaintiff) on January 12. On February 1, the Judge denied the motion to amend. Petitioner received this denial on February 9 and filed his notice of appeal, bond, and record on appeal on February 27, 1960. The Judge disapproved the appeal, ruling that the January 8 dismissal had already become final on February 11, rendering the February 27 appeal filed out of time. Petitioners filed this mandamus petition to compel the approval of the appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the order denying the admission of the amended complaint is appealable and the appeal was perfected on time.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that even after an order dismissing a complaint is issued, an amendment may still be allowed provided the motion to amend is filed before the dismissal order becomes final and unappealable [1, 2]. If the motion to amend is denied, the order of denial is appealable, and the period to appeal is counted from the notice of the denial—not from the order dismissing the original complaint [2, 3].

The Court reasoned that counting the period from the original dismissal would place the right to appeal at the mercy of the court, which could frustrate the appeal by delaying the resolution of the motion to amend until the original appeal period expires [2, 3]. Here, the motion to amend was filed on January 12, well within the period. The denial was received on February 9, and the appeal was perfected on February 27, only 18 days later, which is within the reglementary period [4]. Thus, the appeal was timely.

The petition for mandamus was **GRANTED**, and the respondent Judge was ordered to approve and certify the appeal [5].
