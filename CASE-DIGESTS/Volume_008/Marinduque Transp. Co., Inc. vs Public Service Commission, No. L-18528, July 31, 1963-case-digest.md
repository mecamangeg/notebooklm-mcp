I. CAPTION
MARINDUQUE TRANSPORTATION CO., INC. and THE ESTATE OF ESCOLASTICA LECAROZ v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, AUGUSTO S. AREVALO and ANGEL AREVALO, G.R. No. L-18528, July 31, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Augusto and Angel Arevalo applied for a certificate of public convenience (CPC) with the Public Service Commission (PSC). The PSC commissioned the Justice of the Peace of Buenavista, Marinduque to take the depositions of the parties' witnesses. After respondents presented their evidence, petitioners (oppositors) filed a motion on November 17, 1960, requesting to present their witnesses in Manila and Sta. Cruz, Marinduque, citing inconvenience and expense. The PSC failed to act on this motion for five months, during which the deposition proceedings were suspended [1-3].

On April 13, 1961, the PSC rendered a decision granting the CPC to respondents and, in the same decision, denied petitioners' pending motion to change the venue for presenting evidence [4]. Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration and requested a hearing date pursuant to the Public Service Act. The PSC denied the motion for reconsideration without conducting a hearing [5, 6]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, arguing they were deprived of their day in court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission deprived petitioners of due process and violated the Public Service Act by deciding the case without resolving their motion to present evidence and denying their motion for reconsideration without a hearing.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioners were deprived of their day in court. The Court found that it was not the petitioners' fault that they failed to present their witnesses, but rather the result of the Commission's inaction on their timely and reasonable request to present evidence in Manila and Sta. Cruz [3]. By denying the motion only in the final decision granting the CPC, the PSC effectively prevented petitioners from presenting their case.

Furthermore, the PSC violated Section 34 of the Public Service Act. The Court emphasized that under this provision, "it shall be the duty of the Commission to call a hearing on said petition [for reconsideration] immediately, with notice to the parties, and after hearing, to decide the same promptly" [3]. The Commission's denial of the motion for reconsideration without setting it for hearing was contrary to law.

The writ of certiorari was granted, the decision of the Public Service Commission was set aside, and the case was remanded for further proceedings [7].
