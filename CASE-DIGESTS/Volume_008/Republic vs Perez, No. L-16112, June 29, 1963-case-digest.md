**I. CAPTION**
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. JUDGE JESUS Y. PEREZ and STA. CRUZ TIMBER COMPANY, G.R. No. L-16112, June 29, 1963, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
On March 20, 1958, the Republic of the Philippines filed a complaint against Sta. Cruz Timber Company (SCTC) and its surety for the forfeiture of a forestry bond due to unpaid forest charges [1]. The complaint alleged that SCTC could be served with summons through its President, Alfonso L. Felix [2]. On March 29, 1958, the Sheriff served the summons on SCTC through "President Attorney Alfonso Felix, Jr." by leaving copies with one Montano Renato [3]. SCTC failed to answer and was declared in default on September 20, 1958 [4].

On September 10, 1959, Atty. Felix appeared and informed the court that he had ceased to be the President or Director of SCTC since April 1949, and that Montano Renato was not an employee of the company [4-6]. Consequently, respondent Judge Perez set aside the order of default on September 12, 1959, finding that no valid service of summons had been effected [7]. The Republic’s motion for reconsideration was denied, prompting this petition for certiorari and mandamus, alleging grave abuse of discretion [8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion in lifting the order of default due to invalid service of summons.
2. W/N certiorari or mandamus is the proper remedy.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The trial court correctly lifted the order of default because it had not acquired jurisdiction over the respondent corporation. Under **Section 13, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court**, service upon a domestic corporation must be made on the "president, manager, secretary, cashier, agent, or any of its directors" [9, 10]. Since Alfonso Felix was no longer connected with SCTC in any of those capacities (being merely a stockholder) and Montano Renato was not an employee, the service was invalid [10, 11]. The Court held that permitting SCTC to answer after discovering the lack of valid service was proper to give the company its day in court [11].

2. **NO.** The petition for certiorari and mandamus lacks merit. The Supreme Court reiterated the doctrine that judicial errors or mistakes of law are proper subjects of appeal, not of certiorari or mandamus, citing *Villa Rey Transit, Inc. v. Bello* (G.R. No. L-18957) [9, 12]. Even assuming the trial court erred, not all errors of law or fact constitute grave abuse of discretion [12].

The Writ is denied, and the orders lifting the default are affirmed [13].
