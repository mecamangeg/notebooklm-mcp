**I. CAPTION**
CONCEPCION ASETRE MOTOOMULL v. HON. ABUNDIO Z. ARRIETA, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Oriental Misamis, and PILAR ASETRE GARCIA, G.R. No. L-15972, May 31, 1963, 8 SCRA 172, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Pilar Asetre Garcia filed an action to quiet title against her sister, petitioner Concepcion Asetre Motoomull, over a parcel of coconut land in Misamis Oriental [1]. Garcia claimed ownership via a donation from their father, while Motoomull claimed she purchased the land through their father as her agent [1, 2].

During the pendency of the case, Garcia filed a petition for receivership, alleging that the litigated property, originally 108 hectares, had been reduced to 54 hectares under Motoomull’s possession [1, 3]. Garcia further alleged that Motoomull had fraudulently sold a portion to her son and that both had mortgaged the properties to the Philippine National Bank (PNB) for loans totaling P70,000 [4]. These loans remained unpaid despite the income derived from the land, creating a risk of foreclosure [3, 5].

Respondent Judge Arrieta granted the receivership to protect the property [4]. Motoomull moved to lift the order by offering to file a bond pursuant to Rule 61, Section 4, but the trial court denied the motion [4]. Motoomull filed a petition for certiorari, alleging grave abuse of discretion.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the trial court gravely abused its discretion in placing the property under receivership and refusing to lift it upon an offer of a bond.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Respondent Judge acted with reasonableness and within the sound discretion of the court [6].

The appointment of a receiver is proper to protect the interest of a party *pendente lite* from the danger of irreparable loss [2]. The Court found that Garcia established a *prima facie* case for receivership based on evidence that: (1) the land area was significantly reduced during Motoomull's possession; (2) third parties were claiming portions of the land; and (3) the property was mortgaged to PNB with unpaid loans, creating a clear risk of foreclosure and total loss of the property [2].

Furthermore, the Court ruled that Motoomull’s offer to file a bond was properly rejected. Unlike in cases where a bond can answer for a fixed obligation (citing *Lacson v. Hodges*), a bond in this case could not adequately compensate for the potential loss of the land itself through foreclosure [7, 8].

The petition was **DENIED**.
