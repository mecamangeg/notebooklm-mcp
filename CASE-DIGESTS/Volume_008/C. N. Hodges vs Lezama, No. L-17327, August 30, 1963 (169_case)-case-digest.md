I. CAPTION
C. N. HODGES and RICARDO GURREA v. JOSE MANUEL LEZAMA and PAQUITA B. LEZAMA, G.R. No. L-17327, August 30, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs C.N. Hodges and Ricardo Gurrea, majority stockholders of La Paz Ice Plant & Cold Storage Co., Inc., filed a complaint for mismanagement against the corporation's President and Secretary, Jose and Paquita Lezama. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo placed the corporation under receivership. Pending the case, third parties (Jeruta, Jr., Espinosa, and Perlado) purchased seven shares of stock from plaintiff Gurrea. Despite the surrender of the stock certificates, Paquita Lezama, as Corporate Secretary, refused to register the transfer in the corporate books. The buyers filed a motion within the receivership case to compel the registration. The trial court ordered Paquita Lezama to record the transfer. She appealed, questioning the court's jurisdiction to issue such an order against her in a receivership proceeding involving parties other than the buyers.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court has jurisdiction to order the corporate secretary to register a transfer of shares while the corporation is under receivership.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. The Court held that a trial court has jurisdiction to order a receiver to do any act to protect and preserve the corporation's properties. To that end, the court also has the authority to order the corporate secretary to perform acts regarding internal affairs, such as registering stock transfers, to protect the interests of the stockholders [1]. Citing *Angeles v. Santos*, the Court ruled that since the assets were under receivership, the trial court was duty-bound to require the secretary to perform her duties under the law. Furthermore, Sections 35 and 52 of the Corporation Law require valid transfers to be noted in the corporate books and contemplate no restriction as to whom shares may be sold [1].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED.
