I. CAPTION
ADELA SANTOS GUTIERREZ v. JOSE D. VILLEGAS and RIZALINA SANTOS RIVERA, G.R. No. L-17117, July 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Irene Santos died intestate in 1954, leaving as heirs her husband, Jose D. Villegas (administrator), and two nieces, plaintiff Adela Santos Gutierrez and defendant Rizalina Santos Rivera [1]. On January 12, 1955, Adela signed a notarized deed, "Kasulatan Ng Bilihan At Salinan," selling her share in the estate to Rizalina for P50,000.00 [1]. Adela later filed a suit to annul the deed, alleging fraud and mistake. She claimed she was illiterate, had poor eyesight, and was led to believe the document was a loan agreement [2, 3]. She further argued the consideration was grossly inadequate as the estate was undervalued, amounting to lesion [4]. The defendants countered that Adela understood the transaction, evidenced by her securing a residence certificate and accepting the first installment [5, 6]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissed the complaint and the defendants' counterclaim for damages [7]. Both parties appealed directly to the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the deed of sale is voidable due to fraud or mistake.
2. W/N the contract is rescindable on account of lesion (inadequacy of price).
3. W/N the defendants are entitled to moral/exemplary damages and attorney's fees.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Plaintiff failed to prove fraud. Her claims of illiteracy and poor eyesight were contradicted by evidence showing she could read Tagalog (the language of the deed) and identify documents without eyeglasses during trial [8]. She voluntarily secured a residence certificate and returned to the law office to sign a manifestation the following day, negating the claim that she was tricked into signing a loan document [9]. Fraud must be established by convincing evidence, not merely uncorroborated testimony, especially when the document is notarized [10].

2. **NO.** The Court upheld the valuation of the estate based on the appraisal by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) rather than the plaintiff's witness, finding no evidence that public officials betrayed their duty [11]. Based on the net estate value, the plaintiff's 1/4 share was approximately P54,161.00 [12]. Since she sold it for P50,000.00, the difference does not constitute lesion of more than one-fourth (1/4) of the value, which is required for rescission under Article 1098 of the Civil Code, even if the transaction were deemed a partition under Article 1082 [13].

3. **NO.** The defendants are not entitled to damages. There was no proof of mental suffering to justify moral damages [14]. Without actual, nominal, temperate, or compensatory damages, exemplary damages cannot be awarded (Civil Code, Art. 2234) [14]. Furthermore, allegations in a complaint are privileged, and the failure to seek amicable settlement (Art. 222) was not raised by the defense in their answer or motion to dismiss [14].

**Decision affirmed.**
