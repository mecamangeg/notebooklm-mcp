I. CAPTION
SAN TEODORO DEVELOPMENT ENTERPRISES, INC. v. SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-17662, May 30, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Chua Lam & Company, Ltd., a limited partnership registered in 1951, operated a lumber sawmill under the name "San Teodoro Sawmill." On December 15, 1956, the partners agreed to dissolve the partnership. Shortly thereafter, on January 2, 1957, San Teodoro Sawmill, Inc. (later renamed San Teodoro Development Enterprises, Inc.) was organized [1, 2]. The partnership formally dissolved in July 1957, having sold its assets to the new corporation in June 1957 [2, 3].

The corporation claimed exemption from compulsory coverage under Section 9 of the Social Security Act (Republic Act No. 1161), arguing it was a distinct entity organized only in 1957 and had not yet been in operation for two years [4]. The Social Security Commission denied the exemption, finding that the corporation was merely a continuation of the partnership, noting that four out of five partners owned the controlling stock and held management positions in the new corporation [5, 6]. The corporation appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner corporation is exempt from compulsory Social Security System (SSS) coverage on the ground that it has been in operation for less than two years.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the resolution of the Social Security Commission [7]. The Court held that there was merely a change in the juridical personality of the entity operating the business, but the substance remained the same [8].

The evidence showed the dissolution of the partnership and the organization of the corporation were effected in a sequence ensuring a smooth transfer of business without interruption. The controlling stockholders and management remained with the former partners, and the trade name "San Teodoro Sawmill" was retained [6, 9].

Citing *Laguna Transportation Co., Inc. v. Social Security System* (G.R. No. L-14606), the Court applied the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate fiction [8]. While a corporation generally has a separate personality, this fiction will be disregarded when invoked to defeat public convenience or evade statutory obligations. To grant the exemption would defeat the purpose of the Social Security Act, as employers could simply change their organizational form every two years to avoid coverage [7, 10].

The resolution of the Social Security Commission is affirmed [7].
