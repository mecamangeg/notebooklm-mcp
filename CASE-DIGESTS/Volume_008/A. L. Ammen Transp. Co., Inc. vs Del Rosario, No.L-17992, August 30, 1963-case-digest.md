I. CAPTION
A. L. AMMEN TRANSPORTATION CO., INC., BICOL TRANSPORTATION CO., INC., and CONSOLIDATED AUTO LINES, INC. v. EMILIANO DEL ROSARIO, G.R. No. L-17992, August 30, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Emiliano del Rosario applied with the Public Service Commission (PSC) to operate four passenger trucks on the Tiwi-Naga City line and one truck on the Tiwi-Legaspi City line [1]. On December 22, 1960, the PSC granted the application, finding del Rosario financially capable of maintaining the service [1]. Petitioners, existing transportation operators in the Bicol region, appealed the decision, arguing that the respondent lacked the financial capacity to establish the service [2].

During the trial, del Rosario claimed to own commercial property in Pasig valued at P14,000 and a house and lot in Makati valued at P20,000, while working as a bus driver earning approximately P5-6 daily [2]. However, petitioners presented tax rolls showing no real estate declared in del Rosario's name in Pasig, and that his Makati property was significantly smaller and assessed at a much lower value (P2,500 total) than claimed [3]. Records also showed he had only one registered truck and had not registered new units since 1961 [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent has the required financial capacity to establish and maintain the proposed public service.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the respondent's financial condition rendered it impossible for him to run the authorized public service efficiently and successfully [4, 5].

While the law does not fix a specific amount for establishing a bus line and leaves this determination to the discretion of the Public Service Commission, the evidence in this case did not support the PSC's finding [4, 5]. The Court took judicial notice of the fact that trucks, their bodies, and tires are expensive, demanding considerable capital not just for acquisition but for the wages of drivers, mechanics, and employees necessary for safe and satisfactory service [5]. The documentary evidence from tax rolls contradicted respondent's testimony regarding his assets, proving he lacked the means to undertake the operation [3, 5]. Furthermore, the respondent's subsequent claim of having registered the units was unsupported by evidence of ownership or condition, failing to cure the lack of financial ability [6].

WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is SET ASIDE and the application of the applicant-respondent is DENIED [7].
