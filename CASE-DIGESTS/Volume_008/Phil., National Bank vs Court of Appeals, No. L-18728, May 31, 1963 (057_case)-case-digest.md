I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18728, May 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On March 22, 1960, Philippine National Bank (PNB) filed a complaint against Raymundo Vargas in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental to recover P18,500.00 [1]. Vargas moved to dismiss on the ground of prescription, which the CFI granted [1]. PNB filed a notice of appeal expressly stating its intention to appeal directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law [2, 3]. However, PNB subsequently filed a petition for *mandamus* with the Court of Appeals (CA) to compel the CFI to approve its record on appeal [3]. The CA dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, reasoning that since PNB intended to appeal to the Supreme Court, the *mandamus* was not "in aid of" the CA's appellate jurisdiction [3]. PNB argued that the CA should have transferred the case to the Supreme Court instead of dismissing it [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to issue a writ of *mandamus* when the appeal is expressly directed to the Supreme Court.
2. W/N the Court of Appeals should have transferred the erroneously filed petition to the Supreme Court instead of dismissing it.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 30 of Republic Act 296, the Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction to issue writs of *mandamus* only when such remedy is invoked "merely in aid of its appellate jurisdiction" [5]. This means the CA can only act on the special civil action if the main case falls under its exclusive appellate jurisdiction [6]. Since PNB unequivocally manifested in its notice of appeal that it was appealing directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law, the main case would not be brought to the CA [6]. Therefore, the petition was not in aid of the CA's appellate jurisdiction.

2. **NO.** The Court rejected PNB's argument that the CA should have transferred the petition under Section 31 of the Judiciary Act of 1948 [4]. The Court held that Section 31 applies only to cases that are "erroneously appealed," and not to special civil actions (like *mandamus*) originally filed with the proper appellate court [4]. Since this was an original action erroneously filed, dismissal was proper.

Petition denied [7].
