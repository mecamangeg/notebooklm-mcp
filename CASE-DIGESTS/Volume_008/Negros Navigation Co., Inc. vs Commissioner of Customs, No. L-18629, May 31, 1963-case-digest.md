I. CAPTION
NEGROS NAVIGATION CO., INC. v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18629, May 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Negros Navigation Co., Inc. purchased new marine engines to replace old ones on its vessel, "Don Julio." The old engines were deposited at the Iloilo wharf. The Collector of Customs of Iloilo assessed storage charges of P19,601.92 against the petitioner for the old engines. Petitioner requested reconsideration. The Collector sought the opinion of the Commissioner of Customs, who replied via indorsement that the engines were considered "cargo" subject to storage charges. Implementing this opinion, the Collector demanded payment.

Petitioner filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). The CTA dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that there was no "decision" by the Commissioner of Customs that was reviewable on appeal, as the Commissioner merely rendered an opinion upon the Collector's request. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Commissioner's endorsements should be considered reviewable decisions.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the opinion or concurrence of the Commissioner of Customs on a matter referred to him by the Collector constitutes a "decision" appealable to the Court of Tax Appeals.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Commissioner’s concurrence with the Collector's decision via an opinion or endorsement cannot be considered a decision subject to appeal to the CTA. The Court explained that the Commissioner's action on matters referred by a Collector for advice is merely supervisory in nature; his conformity or disagreement does not transform the Collector's ruling into a decision of the Commissioner [1, 2].

Citing *Sampaguita Shoe & Slipper Factory v. Commissioner*, the Court emphasized that under the law, an aggrieved party must first exhaust administrative remedies by appealing the Collector's adverse ruling to the Commissioner within 15 days (Section 1380, Revised Administrative Code). Only after the Commissioner renders a decision on that specific appeal can the party petition the Court of Tax Appeals within 30 days (Section 7, R.A. No. 1125) [3, 4]. Since the petitioner failed to follow this procedure, the CTA correctly dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction.

The Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed.
