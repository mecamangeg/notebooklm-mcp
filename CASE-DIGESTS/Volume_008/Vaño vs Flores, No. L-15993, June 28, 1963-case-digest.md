I. CAPTION
TEODORO VAÑO v. MARCELO S. FLORES, G.R. No. L-15993, June 28, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On January 16, 1952, Marcelo S. Flores filed a claim for service compensation in the probate proceedings of the will of Jose Vaño (Special Proceedings No. 5619-R) before the Court of First Instance of Cebu [1]. Flores claimed P58,055.00 representing 50% of subdivision lot sales and P80,890.00 under a contract [1]. Petitioner-Administrator Teodoro Vaño opposed the claim [2]. The trial court declared the contract valid and ordered the administrator to pay Flores one-half of the sales proceeds (amounting to P207,536.00) after deducting P100,890.00 payable to Cebu Mutual Building and Loan Association and the estate, P4,500.00 for intermediaries, and other expenses [2]. Petitioner appealed directly to the Supreme Court on February 4, 1959 [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the case falls within the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals. Although the appeal was perfected before the Supreme Court in early 1959, the law regarding appellate jurisdiction was amended on August 1, 1959 [3]. Under the amendment, where the amount of the claim involved is less than P200,000.00 and the assignments of error involve both questions of fact and law, jurisdiction lies with the Court of Appeals [3, 4]. Since the amount involved in this appeal is less than P200,000.00 and raises mixed questions of fact and law, the Court resolved to certify the case to the Court of Appeals [3].
