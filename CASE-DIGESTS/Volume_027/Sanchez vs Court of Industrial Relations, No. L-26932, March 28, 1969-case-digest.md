I. CAPTION
RUPERTO SANCHEZ, doing business under the name and style of PRESERVER SHOE COMPANY and MODESTO SANCHEZ v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, PRESERVER SHOE WORKERS' UNION-NAFLU, et al., G.R. No. L-26932, March 28, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
This case is an offshoot of a final Supreme Court decision (*Sanchez v. CIR*, L-19000, 1963) which ordered petitioners to reinstate workers and pay back wages from May 18, 1958. Reinstatement became impossible when the company ceased operations on November 2, 1963. Petitioners paid P49,774.11 in back wages to 27 workers. However, ten employees were initially excluded from this payment because their names did not appear in the payrolls and time cards examined.

On December 7, 1965, these ten excluded employees filed a motion with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to compute their back wages. Relying on the testimony of only two witnesses, the CIR issued an order on September 27, 1966, directing the payment of P52,705.83 to seven of the claimants. The CIR computed their wages based on a continuous six-day work week from 1958 to 1963. Petitioners appealed, arguing that: (1) the order reversed previous final orders excluding these workers; (2) the evidence was insufficient as not all claimants testified; and (3) the computation was arbitrary and violated the law of the case, noting the huge disparity between the amounts awarded to the original 27 workers (approx. P1,844 each) and the new 7 claimants (approx. P7,817 each).

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR order granting back wages to the previously excluded employees constitutes a reversal of its own final orders.
2. W/N the testimony of only two witnesses is sufficient to support the claims of seven employees.
3. W/N the CIR's computation of back wages based on a continuous six-day work week was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The previous exclusion of the ten workers was solely because their names were not in the specific documents examined, not a final adjudication denying their rights [1, 2]. Furthermore, under Section 17 of Commonwealth Act No. 103, the CIR is empowered to alter, modify, or set aside its orders to effectuate the purpose of the law, a power that is liberally construed [3].

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court rejected the argument that all claimants must testify personally. Citing *Ormoc Sugar Co., Inc. v. OSCO Workers Fraternity Labor Union*, the Court held that "quality and not quantity of witnesses should be the primordial consideration in the appraisal of evidence" [4]. Factual findings of the CIR regarding credibility are binding on the Supreme Court absent grave abuse of discretion [5].

3. **NO.** The computation was arbitrary and violative of the **law of the case**. The doctrine of the law of the case applies not only to the decision itself but also to its implementation [6]. The original 27 workers were paid based on a computation recognizing the company was not in continuous operation (approx. 803 working days). By computing the wages of the 7 new claimants on a continuous six-day basis (1,653 working days), the CIR created a "shocking and unconscionable" disparity [6, 7]. This lacked **substantial evidence**, violating the petitioners' due process rights as established in *Ang Tibay v. Court of Industrial Relations* [8].

The petition is **GRANTED**. The Order of September 27, 1966 is **SET ASIDE**, and the case is **REMANDED** to the CIR to compute the back wages using the same basis applied to the co-employees whose claims were previously satisfied [9].
