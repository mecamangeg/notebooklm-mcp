I. CAPTION
HEIRS OF GABRIEL ZARI and HEIRS OF HERMENEGILDO CONCEPCION v. JOSE R. SANTOS, G.R. Nos. L-21213 & L-21214, March 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 651, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
In 1934, Juan Fuentes entered into contracts of conditional sale with Hermenegildo Concepcion and Gabriel Zari for 5,000 square meters of land each. In 1941, Fuentes assigned his rights to defendant Jose R. Santos, who subsequently acquired the title to the entire property. Santos refused to recognize the contracts, prompting Concepcion and Zari to file separate suits in 1941. In 1943, the parties executed a compromise agreement whereby plaintiffs would receive smaller lots (approx. 2,000 sqm) and dismiss their suits, which they did. However, Santos refused to execute the deeds of sale required by the compromise.

Before the New Civil Code took effect, plaintiffs filed a second set of suits to enforce their *original* claims (5,000 sqm). The Concepcion case reached the Supreme Court (*Concepcion v. Santos*, 89 Phil. 429), which ruled that the original claims were released by the compromise and the remedy was to enforce the compromise, not litigate the original claims.

After the New Civil Code (NCC) took effect, Santos continued to refuse to honor the compromise. Plaintiffs then filed the present suits (Civil Case 1769 and amended Civil Case 802) seeking to *rescind* the compromise under Article 2041 of the NCC and revive their original demands for 5,000 sqm each. The trial court ruled in favor of plaintiffs, rescinding the compromise and awarding the original areas. Santos appealed, arguing he had a vested right under the old Code and the previous SC decision was the law of the case.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs can rescind the compromise agreement executed prior to the New Civil Code and revive their original claims under Article 2041 of the New Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision.

Article 2041 of the New Civil Code creates for the first time the right of rescission for compromises, allowing an aggrieved party to "either enforce the compromise or regard it as rescinded and insist upon his original demand." While Article 2252 provides that new rights in the Code should not impair vested rights acquired under old legislation, the Court held that the defendant had no "vested right" to be protected.

A vested right must be fixed and absolute. The defendant's right to be released from the original claims was conditional upon his compliance with the compromise (executing deeds of sale). Since he never complied, his right never vested unconditionally [1, 2]. Furthermore, Article 2257 of the NCC provides that if a "continuous or repeated act or omission" subsists after the Code becomes operative, the Code's sanctions apply. Defendant's refusal to comply with the compromise continued after the NCC took effect, subjecting him to the new remedy of rescission [3].

The previous ruling in *Concepcion v. Santos* does not bar the present action because: (1) it was decided under the old Code; (2) it recognized the right to enforce the compromise, but the NCC added the *alternative* right to rescind; and (3) it is not the "law of the case" regarding the *continued* violation after the NCC took effect, which could not have been envisioned in the earlier decision [4].

Disposition: Decision affirmed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Reyes, J.B.L., J. (Dissenting):** Argued that the compromise novated and extinguished the original obligations under the old Code. Santos acquired a vested right to immunity from the original claims. The remedy should be specific performance of the compromise with damages, not rescission, as applying the new Code divests him of acquired immunity [5, 6].

**Barredo, J. (Concurring and Dissenting):** Concurred regarding the Heirs of Zari but dissented regarding the Heirs of Concepcion. He argued that for the Concepcions, the previous SC decision (*Concepcion v. Santos*) is the "law of the case" which definitively foreclosed their right to the original 5,000 sqm, regardless of the new Code [7, 8].
