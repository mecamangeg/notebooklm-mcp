I. CAPTION
TOMAS L. LANTING (doing business under the style and firm name, Lanting Security and Watchman Agency) v. RESTITUTO GUEVARA, HON. ANTONIO PAREDES and THE SHERIFF OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-22799, April 25, 1969, 27 SCRA 974, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Restituto Guevara filed a suit for unpaid wages against petitioner Tomas Lanting in the City Court of Manila. The court rendered judgment ordering Lanting to pay Guevara unpaid wages, overtime pay, and attorney's fees. Lanting filed a Notice of Appeal and Appeal Bond within the reglementary period but failed to pay the appellate docket fee. Consequently, the City Court denied the appeal. Lanting moved for reconsideration, claiming excusable negligence; he alleged he instructed his messenger to pay the fee, but the messenger failed to do so because the court personnel did not demand it and he used the money for his ill mother. Lanting attached an affidavit of merits stating generally that he had a valid defense based on "undisputed facts" and "applicable law" without specifying them. The City Court denied the motion and issued a writ of execution. Lanting filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Court of First Instance of Manila, which was dismissed. Lanting appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to pay the appellate docket fee constitutes excusable negligence.
2. W/N the affidavit of merits submitted by the petitioner is sufficient to warrant relief.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The excuse is unacceptable. Under Section 2, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court, payment of the appellate docket fee is a prerequisite to perfect an appeal. It is the duty of the appellant and his attorney to ensure the appeal is perfected within the time limit. The Court, citing *Philippine Air Lines, Inc. v. Arca*, held that blaming a messenger is a "hackneyed and habitual subterfuge" employed by litigants who fail to observe procedural requirements.

2. **NO.** The affidavit of merits was insufficient because it contained only conclusionary averments. The petitioner merely stated a belief that he was not liable based on "facts and circumstances" without spelling out the specific facts constituting a valid defense. Citing *Jocson v. Nable*, the Court ruled that an affidavit that does not contain an averment of facts is not the one contemplated by the Rules. Additionally, the Court noted that based on Lanting's own admissions, his liability to Guevara was direct, making the appeal a waste of effort.

Judgment and order affirmed.
