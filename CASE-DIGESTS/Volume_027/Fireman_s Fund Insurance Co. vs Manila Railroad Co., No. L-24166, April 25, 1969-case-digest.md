I. CAPTION
FIREMAN’S FUND INSURANCE COMPANY v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and its Subsidiary MANILA PORT SERVICE, G.R. No. L-24166, April 25, 1969, Barredo, J.

II. FACTS
On March 25, 1962, the SS "Zeeland" arrived in Manila and discharged a shipment of crude natural rubber consigned to B.F. Goodrich (Phil.), Inc. into the custody of the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service (a subsidiary of Manila Railroad Company) [1]. Of the shipment, 15 bales were lost and not delivered [1, 2]. Within 15 days from the discharge of the last package, the consignee filed a "provisional claim" for the missing bales; however, this claim did not specify the value of the goods, nor did it detail the marks or contents, though it identified the shipment by vessel name and bill of lading [1, 3, 4]. A "formal claim" indicating the value was filed three months later [1]. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company, the insurer, paid the consignee for the loss and filed suit against the arrastre operators [5]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Fireman’s Fund [5]. The defendants appealed, arguing that the provisional claim was invalid under Section 15 of the Management Contract because it lacked the value and specific description of the goods [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a provisional claim filed within the 15-day period constitutes sufficient compliance with the Management Contract even if it fails to state the value or specific description of the goods. [3]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that a provisional claim substantially fulfills the requirements of Section 15 of the Management Contract even if it does not specify the value of the loss [6]. Citing *Filipro, Inc. v. Manila Port Service* and *Domestic Insurance Co. v. Manila Railroad Co.*, the Court ruled that a provisional claim is sufficient if it describes the goods well enough to permit identification by the operator (e.g., via the carrying vessel, date of arrival, or bill of lading) while the facts are still fresh [7, 8]. The Court noted that requiring a consignee to state the detailed nature and value of missing goods within 15 days would be requiring the impossible, as it is a matter of public knowledge that such details are often not ascertained before goods are released by Customs [9].

The appeal was dismissed. [10]
