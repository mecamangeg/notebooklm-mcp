I. CAPTION
BERNARDINA FLORENDO v. BONIFACIA FLORENDO, DOROTEA FLORENDO and RUFINA FLORENDO, G.R. No. L-24982, March 28, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Bernardina Florendo filed an ejectment suit against defendants Bonifacia, Dorotea, and Rufina Florendo on September 15, 1962 [1]. The lower court set the case for hearing on August 27, 1964, and October 21, 1964. Notices were sent to the house of the defendants' counsel of record, but the envelopes were returned unclaimed [1]. The trial proceeded in the defendants' absence, and the lower court rendered a decision in favor of the plaintiff on October 31, 1964 [1].

Defendants filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied. Subsequently, through new counsel, they filed a Petition for Relief from Judgment, alleging they were denied their day in court [2]. They claimed "excusable negligence" because their previous counsel was in Manila attending a seminar to become an election registrar and did not personally receive the notices, though it was admitted the notices were delivered to his house [2, 3]. Regarding their defense on the merits, they merely alleged they possessed the land in the "honest belief" that they were entitled to it [4]. The lower court denied the petition [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the denial of the petition for relief from judgment violated the defendants' right to procedural due process. [5, 6]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. Procedural due process is satisfied if the court is competent, impartial, possessed of jurisdiction, and accords parties the right to be heard [5, 7]. Here, the lower court performed its duty by sending notices to the counsel's address, which were admittedly received by persons present at the house [6].

The failure of the defendants to participate was due to their own lack of prudence. It is the duty of a party litigant to make proper inquiries to their counsel concerning their case [8]. Furthermore, a petition for relief requires a meritorious defense to be granted. The defendants' claim of "honest belief" regarding their possession is not a valid legal defense and does not constitute a positive averment of right to the land [4]. Granting a rehearing would be futile and time-consuming as there was no indication the result would change [9].

The decision and order of the lower court are affirmed [10].
