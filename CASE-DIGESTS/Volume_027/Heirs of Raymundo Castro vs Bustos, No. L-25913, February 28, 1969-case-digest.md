I. CAPTION
HEIRS OF RAYMUNDO CASTRO v. APOLONIO BUSTOS, G.R. No. L-25913, February 28, 1969, Barredo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Apolonio Bustos was charged with murder for the killing of Raymundo Castro. The Court of First Instance of Pampanga convicted him only of homicide, crediting him with two mitigating circumstances (passion or obfuscation and voluntary surrender), and sentenced him to imprisonment and to indemnify the petitioners (heirs) in the sum of P6,000 [1].

On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) initially modified the judgment by awarding, in addition to the P6,000 death indemnity, P6,000 in moral damages and P13,380 for loss of earning capacity [2]. However, upon respondent's motion for reconsideration, the CA promulgated an Amended Decision eliminating the award of moral and compensatory damages, reasoning that the presence of mitigating circumstances justified their deletion under Article 2204 of the Civil Code [3, 4]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the elimination of these damages [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals erred in eliminating the award of moral damages and indemnity for loss of earning capacity due to the presence of mitigating circumstances.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the CA erred in completely deleting the damages. While Article 2204 of the Civil Code provides that "damages to be adjudicated may be respectively increased or lessened according to the aggravating or mitigating circumstances," this does not warrant a complete deletion of said items [6].

When a crime results in death, the civil obligations are governed by penal laws subject to the Civil Code [7]. Under Article 2206, the defendant is liable for the loss of the earning capacity of the deceased, and the spouse, descendants, and ascendants may demand moral damages for mental anguish [8, 9]. These damages may be adjudicated even without proof of pecuniary loss [9].

The Court restated the items of damages recoverable in cases of death caused by a crime:
1.  **Civil Indemnity:** P12,000 (increased from P3,000/P6,000 in jurisprudence), without need of proof [9, 10].
2.  **Loss of Earning Capacity:** Amount fixed by the court based on actual income and probable life expectancy [10].
3.  **Moral Damages:** For mental anguish, recoverable by the spouse, legitimate and illegitimate descendants, and ascendants [11].
4.  **Exemplary Damages:** If the crime is attended by aggravating circumstances [11].
5.  **Attorney's Fees:** Recoverable when a separate civil action is filed or exemplary damages are awarded [11].

In this case, the facts regarding the deceased's earnings and heirs were undisputed [5]. The Court restored the awards of P6,000 for moral damages and P13,380 for loss of earning capacity, in addition to the P6,000 death indemnity awarded by the trial court [12]. The Court noted it could not increase the death indemnity to the prevailing P12,000 jurisprudence because the petitioners did not appeal that specific portion [12].

**Disposition:** The amended decision of the Court of Appeals is MODIFIED. Respondent is ordered to pay the items of damages as originally awarded.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Capistrano, J., Concurring:**
Justice Capistrano emphasized that in criminal actions for death, it is the Fiscal's duty to demand payment of damages under Articles 2206 and 2230 unless the heirs reserve the right to a separate civil action [13]. He also noted that where a private prosecutor intervenes, heirs may recover attorney's fees [14].
