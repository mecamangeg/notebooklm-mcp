I. CAPTION
ARSENIO GONZALES and FELICISIMO R. CABIGAO v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, G.R. No. L-27833, April 18, 1969, 27 SCRA 835, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, a private individual and a candidate for Vice-Mayor of Manila, filed a petition for declaratory relief (treated by the Supreme Court as a petition for prohibition) challenging the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 4880 [1], [2]. This Act amended the Revised Election Code by inserting Sections 50-A and 50-B [2]. Section 50-A prohibits the nomination of candidates by political parties earlier than 150 days (for national offices) or 90 days (for local offices) before the election [3]. Section 50-B limits the period for "election campaign" or "partisan political activity" to 120 days and 90 days respectively, defining such activities to include forming organizations to solicit votes, holding rallies, making speeches or commentaries, and publishing campaign materials [4], [5]. Petitioners argued that these provisions violated their constitutional rights to freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association [6]. The Commission on Elections argued the law was a valid exercise of police power to curb the serious evils of prolonged political campaigns, such as violence, corruption, and huge expenditures [7], [8], [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Republic Act No. 4880 (specifically Sections 50-A and 50-B) is unconstitutional for violating the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court upheld the validity of the statute, as the necessary two-thirds vote required to declare a law unconstitutional was not obtained [10].

Regarding **Section 50-A** (Prohibition of too early nomination), the Court unanimously held it **VALID** [4]. The Court reasoned that while the right of association is affected, the curtailment is not such as to render the right meaningless. Limiting the time for nomination is a reasonable regulation of the electoral process [11], [3].

Regarding **Section 50-B** (Limitation on campaign period), the Court was divided.
1.  **Valid Restrictions:** The Court found no unconstitutional infringement in **Section 50-B(a)** (forming organizations for soliciting votes) and **Section 50-B(f)** (giving/soliciting contributions), and sustained the validity of **Section 50-B(b)** (holding rallies/conventions), though with "gravest doubts" regarding the latter [12], [13].
2.  **Contested Restrictions (Speech/Press):** A majority of the Justices believed that **Section 50-B(c), (d), and (e)**—which prohibit making speeches, commentaries, holding interviews, and publishing campaign literature outside the prohibited period—were **UNCONSTITUTIONAL** for being too broad and vague [14], [15]. The majority held that these provisions suffered from "overbreadth" and operated to inhibit acts affirmatively protected by the Constitution [16], [15]. They reasoned that the "clear and present danger" test requires that restrictions not only be based on a substantive evil but also be limited in scope [17].

However, since the necessary vote of eight (two-thirds) Justices to annul these specific provisions was not secured, the law could not be declared unconstitutional [18]. The minority view, which prevailed by default, argued that the restrictions were valid exercises of police power justified by the "clear and present danger" of the debasement of the electoral process [19], [20].

Petition dismissed; writ of prohibition denied [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
*   **Sanchez, J. (Concurring and Dissenting):** Concurred that Sec. 50-A and Sec. 50-B(a), (b), (f) are valid exercises of police power [21]. Dissented regarding Sec. 50-B(c), (d), and (e), arguing they are unconstitutional because they create a "dragnet" that traps simple expressions of opinion, violating free speech and press [22], [23].
*   **Castro, J. (Separate Opinion):** Concurred on Sec. 50-A but held Sec. 50-B entirely unconstitutional [24]. He applied the "balancing-of-interests" test, arguing that the social value of political discussion outweighs the State's interest in regulating the time of campaigns, and that the law is fatally vague [25], [26].
*   **Barredo, J. (Concurring and Dissenting):** Voted to dismiss because the case was moot (petitioner was already elected) [24]. On the merits, he argued the law is unconstitutional because it effectively prevents the formation of new political parties and infringes on the absolute rights of speech and assembly related to suffrage [27], [28].
*   **Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, and Teehankee, JJ.:** Concurred in the result of dismissal [10].
