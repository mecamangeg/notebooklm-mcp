I. CAPTION
IN RE: PETITION FOR NATURALIZATION, GO AY KOC v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-23652, April 25, 1969, Barredo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Go Ay Koc filed a petition for naturalization on November 24, 1959, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Pasay City Branch) on July 18, 1961. After the statutory two-year period, he filed a motion to take his oath of allegiance on July 19, 1963. The Solicitor General opposed the motion and moved to set aside the 1961 decision.

During the hearing on the motion, it was revealed that the petitioner had lived in various places other than his stated residence (including Pangasinan, Pampanga, Cebu, and multiple locations in Manila) which were not set forth in his petition. Additionally, three of his children were enrolled in Chinese schools (Chang Kai Shek High School and Anglo-Chinese School). Regarding income, he claimed a monthly salary of P300.00 plus commissions and winnings from Sweepstakes and Jai-Alai. The lower court set aside the 1961 decision and denied the motion to take the oath. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to state all former places of residence in the petition is a fatal defect.
2. W/N the enrollment of the petitioner’s children in Chinese schools negates his sincerity to embrace Filipino customs.
3. W/N the petitioner met the lucrative trade or occupation requirement.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 requires a petitioner to set forth his present and former places of residence. The failure to include all former places of residence is a fatal defect that deprives the trial court of jurisdiction to hear and grant the petition. Neither good faith nor subsequent disclosure during the hearing cures this defect, as the omission prevents full inquiry into the irreproachability of the petitioner's behavior and frustrates the intent of the law.

2. **YES.** The enrollment of the petitioner's children in schools run by and for Chinese nationals (with Chinese principals) suggests a failure to evince a sincere desire to embrace Philippine customs, traditions, and ideals. Although the schools were recognized by the government, there was no evidence they were regularly attended by a sizable number of Filipino students, which prevents the children from imbibing Filipino culture.

3. **NO.** The petitioner’s monthly salary of P300.00 is clearly insufficient to support a wife and six children. The Court ruled that "commissions," being generally contingent and speculative, are not considered income for naturalization purposes, especially when the alleged employers are the petitioner's own father and brother. Furthermore, winnings from Sweepstakes and Jai-Alai are speculative and cannot be included. Without these, the petitioner fails to meet the lucrative income requirement.

Appeal dismissed.
