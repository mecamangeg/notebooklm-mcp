I. CAPTION
LEONARDO CATAIN v. HERMINIO RIOS and MARIANO TAMAYO, G.R. No. L-27345, February 28, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On March 8, 1954, Herminio Rios sold a parcel of land in Palawan to Leonardo Catain (Petitioner) through a public instrument. The land was registered under Original Certificate of Title No. 344 in the name of Vicente Catain, Petitioner’s father. Rios delivered the owner’s duplicate title and tax declaration to Petitioner.

On August 20, 1955, Rios sold the same land to Mariano Tamayo (Respondent), who was in actual possession of the property. Tamayo’s possession began earlier but was initially precarious, as he held the land on Rios' behalf pending the settlement of a different land transaction. When Petitioner sought to take physical possession, Tamayo refused.

Petitioner filed a suit to establish title and recover possession. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Tamayo. Applying Article 1544 of the Civil Code, the lower court held that since neither sale was registered, Tamayo had the better right because he was first in physical possession.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Petitioner Catain has the better right of ownership over the subject land compared to Respondent Tamayo.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. Under Article 1544 of the Civil Code regarding double sales, possession includes both actual and constructive possession. The execution of the public instrument of sale in favor of Petitioner in 1954 constituted symbolic delivery and transferred the right *in rem* to him, occurring prior to the sale to Tamayo in 1955 (Art. 1498, Civil Code) [1].

Furthermore, the land was registered under the Torrens system in the name of Petitioner's father. Tamayo is deemed to have constructive notice of this fact and cannot claim to be a buyer in good faith [2]. A deed conveying registered land does not transmit a right *in rem* until registered (Sec. 50, Act No. 496), and Tamayo could not have registered his deed as he did not possess the owner’s duplicate title, which had already been delivered to Petitioner [3].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and Defendants are ordered to vacate the property, deliver possession to Petitioner, and pay damages in the form of palay or its monetary equivalent [4].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
