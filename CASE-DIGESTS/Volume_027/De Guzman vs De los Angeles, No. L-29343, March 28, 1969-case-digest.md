I. CAPTION
FELIPE DE GUZMAN v. HON. WALFRIDO DE LOS ANGELES, LEONARDO GERONIMO, MARIA LAZARO MARIANO, GLICERIA LAZARO MARIANO, THE HEIRS OF PERPETUO LAZARO MARIANO, THE PHILIPPINE TRUST COMPANY and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-29343, March 28, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In Special Proceedings No. Q-573 (Intestate Estate of Antonio Geronimo) before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, respondents Leonardo Geronimo and the Mariano family contested heirship. Petitioner Felipe de Guzman intervened as a creditor, claiming he advanced funds to prosecute a forger of the decedent’s will, thereby preserving the estate [1, 2]. The CFI issued orders in 1965 distributing the estate's properties without notice to creditors or a declaration of heirs, and subsequently denied De Guzman's intervention [3].

De Guzman filed a special civil action with the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA initially annulled the CFI orders and directed the return of properties to the estate [4]. However, the CA later reversed its decision in 1968 [5]. De Guzman petitioned the Supreme Court for review. While the case was pending, the parties filed a "Motion to Approve Amicable Settlement" on March 7, 1969. In the agreement, the respondents confirmed the transfer of a Manila lot to De Guzman and agreed to pay him P30,000.00 in satisfaction of his claims, while De Guzman agreed to withdraw the petition and waive his claims against the estate [6-9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the amicable settlement entered into by the parties should be approved to resolve the case.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court approved the amicable settlement executed by the parties.

The Court found that the parties voluntarily and freely expressed their desire to settle the pending cases (G.R. No. L-29343 and Sp. Proc. No. Q-573) peacefully and to their mutual advantage [10]. The agreement included covenants where the respondents ratified a "Contract to Sell" in favor of the petitioner and agreed to a monetary settlement, while the petitioner waived his rights under the preliminary injunction and agreed to the termination of the intestate proceedings [7, 9].

Consequently, the Court enjoined the parties to comply with the terms of the settlement, dissolved the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Court of Appeals, and dismissed the present action [11].
