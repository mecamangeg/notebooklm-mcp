I. CAPTION
PEDRO DIMASACAT and ERNESTO ROBLES v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK and RAFAEL O. LAGDAMEO, G.R. No. L-26575, February 27, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Rafael Lagdameo mortgaged four parcels of land to the Philippine National Bank (PNB). Subsequently, he sold separate portions of the land to petitioners Ernesto Robles and Pedro Dimasacat via deeds of sale which were not registered. Following Lagdameo's default, PNB extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage and acquired the property at public auction. Before the one-year redemption period expired, petitioners attempted to redeem the property, but PNB rejected their offer. Petitioners filed a suit to enforce their right to repurchase. The CFI dismissed the complaint. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed, holding that petitioners had the right to redeem their *respective portions*, but reserved the question regarding the redemption of the *totality* of the land. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that under the doctrine in *Magno v. Viola*, as successors-in-interest to part of the property, they should be entitled to redeem the entire estate. During the pendency of the appeal, Lagdameo repurchased the property from PNB.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners, as purchasers of specific unregistered portions of a foreclosed property, have the right to redeem the entire property based on the ruling in *Magno v. Viola*.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the doctrine in *Magno v. Viola* (61 Phil. 80) does not support the petitioners' claim to redeem the entire property. The Court clarified that *Magno* established that a co-tenant who redeems the entire joint estate acts for the benefit of all co-tenants. In this case, petitioners had bought only small portions and, because their deeds were unregistered and the boundaries undefined, they possessed at best a personal right to demand a status of co-ownership from the mortgagor. Furthermore, even if petitioners had succeeded in redeeming the whole land, Lagdameo would have been entitled to repurchase the excess area not covered by the petitioners' deeds. Since Lagdameo had already repurchased the land from PNB during the appeal, the issue was effectively resolved. The Court modified the decision, limiting the petitioners' rights to their respective portions rather than the whole estate.
