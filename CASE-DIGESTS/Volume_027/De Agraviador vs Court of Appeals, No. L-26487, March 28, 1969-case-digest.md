I. CAPTION
CONSTANTINA DE AGRAVIADOR and ALFREDO AGRAVIADOR v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS, EUSTAQUIA PEÑALOSA and BERNABE GALO, G.R. No. L-26487, March 28, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Eustaquia Peñalosa worked as a housemaid for petitioners in their hotel from November 1949 to September 1954. After her service ended, she demanded payment for her services. She filed a claim with the Department of Labor on August 6, 1956. The hearing officer and the Labor Standards Commission ruled in her favor, but the CFI of Negros Occidental later dismissed the case (Civil Case No. 5722) on July 14, 1961, for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter.

On September 6, 1961, Peñalosa filed a new complaint (Civil Case No. 6286) in the CFI for unpaid salaries, overtime pay, and Sunday work pay. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling she failed to substantiate her claim and that it was barred by the statute of limitations. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the CFI decision regarding overtime and Sunday pay, awarding P2,676.87. Petitioners appealed, arguing that Peñalosa’s testimony demanding "wages" did not include overtime or Sunday pay, and that the claim had prescribed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent's demand for "wages" includes claims for overtime and Sunday pay.
2. W/N the claim for compensation is barred by the statute of limitations.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the petitioners' assumption that "wages" meant only fixed regular monthly compensation is untenable. As a housemaid with limited schooling, the respondent evidently understood the word "wages" as embracing every amount due to her for services rendered to the petitioners, without distinction between regular work and work performed in excess of eight hours or during Sundays [1].

2. **NO.** The claim has not prescribed.
First, under Article 1145 of the Civil Code, the prescriptive period is six years. The respondent filed her claim with the Department of Labor on August 6, 1956, less than two years after her services ended. Although that case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, the filing tolled the running of the prescriptive period. When the present action was commenced on September 6, 1961, less than two months after the dismissal of the first case, the six-year period had not yet expired [2].

Second, regarding the three-year prescriptive period for overtime claims under Commonwealth Act No. 444 (as amended by R.A. No. 1993), the Court ruled that the period did not begin to run until September 10, 1954, when petitioners explicitly rejected her demand; prior to that, they promised to keep her money in "trust." Furthermore, the three-year limitation introduced by R.A. No. 1993 (effective June 22, 1957) contained a proviso that actions already commenced before its effective date would not be affected [3, 4].

**Decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.**
