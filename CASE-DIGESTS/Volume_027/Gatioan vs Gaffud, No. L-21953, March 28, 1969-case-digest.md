**I. CAPTION**
ENCARNACION GATIOAN v. SIXTO GAFFUD, ET AL., and PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, G.R. No. L-21953, March 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 706, Barredo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Encarnacion Gatioan acquired a parcel of land originally registered in 1935. She obtained Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-1212 in her name in 1949. Between 1950 and 1957, she mortgaged this land three times to the Philippine National Bank (PNB) to secure various loans [1, 2].

Meanwhile, in 1956, Spouses Sixto Gaffud and Villamora Logan obtained a free patent over the *same* land, resulting in the issuance of Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. P-6038. They also mortgaged this land to PNB in 1956 and 1957 to secure their own loans [3, 4]. Consequently, PNB held mortgages on the same distinct parcel of land from two different parties under two different titles.

When the overlap was discovered, the Secretary of Agriculture recommended the cancellation of Gaffud's title. Gatioan filed a complaint for quieting of title. The lower court declared Gaffud’s title (OCT P-6038) null and void ab initio and cancelled PNB's mortgage annotations on said title [5-7]. PNB appealed, arguing that while Gaffud's title was void, the Bank was an innocent mortgagee in good faith and for value, and thus its mortgage lien should be protected [8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N PNB is an innocent mortgagee in good faith whose lien on the void certificate of title should be respected.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision.

The Court applied the doctrine in *Legarda v. Saleeby*, which establishes that in case of double registration where two certificates of title are issued to different persons covering the same land, the earlier in date must prevail [8, 9]. The prior registry of the land effectively serves as notice to the world, precluding any subsequent buyer or mortgagee from claiming the status of an "innocent purchaser" regarding the later, void title [10, 11].

Furthermore, PNB was found guilty of gross negligence. Before the Bank accepted the mortgage from the Gaffud spouses in 1956, it had already dealt with Gatioan regarding the same land in 1950 and 1954. PNB had possession of or examined Gatioan's TCT No. T-1212, which contained the identical technical description, area, and lot numbers as the title later presented by Gaffud [12]. A bank is required to undertake a careful examination of the title and a physical investigation of the land before granting a loan; PNB's failure to discover the obvious overlap despite having both titles in its records negates any claim of good faith [13].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Castro, J., concurs in the result [14].
