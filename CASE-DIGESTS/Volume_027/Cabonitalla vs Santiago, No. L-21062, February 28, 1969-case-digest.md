I. CAPTION
FLORENCIO CABONITALLA, ET AL. v. HON. AMADO SANTIAGO, in his capacity as Presiding Judge of Branch V of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, LUDOVICO ESTRADA, MARCELINO CABOTAJE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21062, February 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 211, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
The case involves a 451-hectare public land in Alcala, Pangasinan. Pindangan Agricultural Co., Inc. (Pindangan) filed Civil Case No. 10394 against several defendants (Estrada, et al.) regarding possession of the land. The trial court initially ruled in favor of Pindangan, but the decision was reversed on appeal. Following the reversal, the lower court (presided by Judge Bacani) issued an order of restitution to restore the defendants to their former landholdings.

In enforcing the writ of execution for restitution, the Sheriff attempted to deliver the entire property to the private defendants for redistribution to 178 persons named in a 1948 list. Consequently, the petitioners herein—302 individuals who claimed to be actual occupants—were ousted or threatened with ouster. Petitioners filed motions with the lower court (then presided by respondent Judge Santiago) alleging they were not parties to Civil Case No. 10394 and had been in possession of the land long before that case was filed. They sought to be heard and to present evidence of their independent possession. Judge Santiago denied their motions, ruling that the order of execution was clear enough. Petitioners filed this action for certiorari and prohibition to annul the orders and compel the judge to receive their evidence. Meanwhile, respondents moved to cite petitioners in contempt for alleged disturbance of possession during the pendency of this action.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioners, who were not parties to the original civil case, are entitled to be heard and present evidence regarding their possession before being ousted by a writ of execution.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the respondent Judge committed a grave abuse of discretion in refusing to entertain the petitioners' motions. The Court held that in an action *in personam*, such as Civil Case No. 10394, the judgment is binding only upon the parties thereto and their successors in interest, but not upon strangers.

Citing *Omaña v. Gatulayao* and *Plata v. Yatco*, the Court reiterated the uniform holding that a person, other than the judgment debtor, who occupies land levied on execution is entitled to be heard to justify his possession. Since the petitioners claimed to be strangers to the case with independent possession, they cannot be ousted without a hearing. The administrative agencies (Director of Lands) were also acknowledged as the proper authorities to determine the allocation of the public land involved.

Accordingly, the respondents' motion to declare petitioners in contempt was **DENIED**, and the respondent Judge was **DIRECTED** to receive evidence on the nature and extent of the petitioners' alleged possession and to pass upon the issues raised in their motions.
