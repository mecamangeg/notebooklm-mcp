I. CAPTION
UNION OF PHILIPPINE EDUCATION EMPLOYEES (NLU) v. PHILIPPINE EDUCATION CO., INC. and THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. Nos. L-24634 & L-24635, March 28, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
The Union of Philippine Education Employees (NLU) filed two complaints for unfair labor practice against Philippine Education Co., Inc. (PECO) regarding the dismissal of 27 employees due to union activities [1]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ordered the reinstatement of 19 employees with back wages but issued different rulings for four specific employees: Ernesto Palaganas, Eduardo Elbanbuena, Jesus Galang, and Maximo Villanueva [1]. Palaganas was not reinstated because the CIR found he was an "off-and-on" worker who went on leave and was never heard from again, causing the company to erase his name from the roster [1, 2]. Meanwhile, Elbanbuena, Galang, and Villanueva were reinstated but denied back wages [1]. The Union appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing Palaganas should be reinstated with back wages like the others, and that the remaining three should also receive back wages [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Palaganas is entitled to reinstatement and back wages.
2. W/N Elbanbuena is entitled to back wages.
3. W/N Galang and Villanueva are entitled to back wages.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Palaganas is not entitled to reinstatement or back wages. The Court held that eliminating an employee's name from the roster because he remained unheard from after his leave of absence expired is not an unfair labor practice [3, 4]. Unlike the other reinstated employees who worked on a regular basis, Palaganas was an "off-and-on" worker who effectively abandoned his post by failing to return or communicate [2, 4].

2. **YES.** Elbanbuena is entitled to back wages. The CIR categorically found that he had been "laid off," which disproved the company's claim that he was merely on extended leave without pay [5]. Since other regular employees who were laid off were granted back wages, justice dictates that Elbanbuena receives the same benefits [6].

3. **NO.** Galang and Villanueva are not entitled to back wages. The CIR found that they were "not laid off" and had actually returned to work upon the expiration of their leaves, continuing in their former positions [6, 7]. This factual finding was undisputed, and there was no evidence presented to the Court that they had been laid off [7].

The decision is **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**, ordering the payment of back wages to Eduardo Elbanbuena for the period from January 9 to November 3, 1960 [7, 8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Fernando, Capistrano, Teehankee, and Barredo concurred with the decision [8].
