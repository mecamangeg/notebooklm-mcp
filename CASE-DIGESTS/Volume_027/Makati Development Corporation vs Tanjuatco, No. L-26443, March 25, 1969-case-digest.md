I. CAPTION
MAKATI DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION v. PEDRO C. TANJUATCO and CONCRETE AGGREGATES, INC., G.R. No. L-26443, March 25, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On February 21, 1963, petitioner Makati Development Corporation (MDC) and respondent Tanjuatco entered into a contract for the construction of a water reservoir and other facilities [1, 2]. Before final payment, Concrete Aggregates, Inc. (Supplier) claimed P5,198.75 for materials delivered to Tanjuatco which remained unpaid [2]. MDC withheld said amount from Tanjuatco with the latter's consent [2]. Because Tanjuatco and the Supplier failed to settle the issue, MDC filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to compel them to interplead [2]. Tanjuatco moved to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, citing that the amount involved was less than P10,000 [3]. The CFI dismissed the case [3]. MDC appealed, arguing that the subject matter of the litigation was not the amount but the right to compel the defendants to litigate among themselves to protect the plaintiff against double vexation [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over an interpleader case where the amount involved is P5,198.75.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the jurisdiction of courts over the subject matter is governed by Republic Act No. 296, as amended [4]. Pursuant to this law, municipal courts have exclusive original jurisdiction in all civil cases where the demand, exclusive of interest, amounts to not more than P10,000 [4]. The Court rejected the petitioner's reliance on the Rules of Court, specifically the omission of Rule 63 (Interpleader) in Rule 5, Sec. 19 regarding inferior courts [4]. The power to define and apportion jurisdiction belongs to Congress under the Constitution and is beyond the rule-making power of the Supreme Court [4]. The omission merely implies that inferior courts are not bound by the specific procedure in Rule 63 but may apply general rules of procedure to interpleader cases [4]. Consequently, the CFI correctly dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. The order appealed from is affirmed [5].
