I. CAPTION
FILOMENO ANCIANO v. MOISES G. OTADOY, et al., G.R. No. L-21267, February 28, 1969, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Filomeno Anciano served in the government from 1917 until his retirement in 1958, simultaneously holding positions as municipal treasurer, deputy provincial treasurer, and postmaster of Poro, Cebu. Upon retirement, he received retirement insurance benefits from the GSIS for his services as deputy provincial treasurer and postmaster. However, he did not receive GSIS benefits for his role as municipal treasurer because the Municipality of Poro was not a member of the GSIS. Consequently, Anciano claimed retirement gratuity under the Osmeña Retirement Law (Act 2589) and sought payment from the Municipality. When the municipal officials refused to appropriate funds for his claim, Anciano filed a petition for mandamus with damages. The Court of First Instance of Cebu dismissed the petition, ruling that the gratuity under Act 2589 is not a liability of the municipality.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Municipality of Poro is liable to pay retirement gratuity under Act 2589.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to additional gratuity under Act 2589 after receiving GSIS retirement benefits.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Municipality is not liable. Section 4 of Act 2589 expressly provides that the sums necessary to implement the Act are appropriated out of funds in the Insular (now National) Treasury. Therefore, even assuming the petitioner is entitled to the gratuity, the financial liability lies with the National Government, not the municipality [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The petitioner is not entitled to further gratuity. Under Section 28(b) of the GSIS Act (Commonwealth Act 186, as amended), "no gratuity or benefit shall be paid by an employer to an employee entitled to the retirement benefit of this Act." The Court held in *Gabriel v. GSIS* and *Lacson v. Auditor General* that the enjoyment of GSIS retirement benefits excludes other gratuities [3]. Although Anciano held multiple posts, he rendered service to only "one Government." Receiving benefits under Act 2589 in addition to GSIS benefits would constitute a double pension for the same services, which is precluded in the absence of an express legal exception [4]. By voluntarily accepting GSIS benefits, Anciano waived his rights under Act 2589 [5].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.
