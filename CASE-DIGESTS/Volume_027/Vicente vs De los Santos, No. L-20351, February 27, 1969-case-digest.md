I. CAPTION
**MAXIMINO VICENTE v. BENITO DE LOS SANTOS**, G.R. No. L-20351, February 27, 1969, Teehankee, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Maximino Vicente was a co-owner of a registered lot in Zamboanga City. After the co-owners failed to pay a mortgage debt to the Zamboanga City Rural Bank, the property was foreclosed and sold at public auction on September 15, 1960, to Oppositor Benito de los Santos [1]. Within the redemption period, Vicente tendered the redemption price, which De los Santos refused. Vicente then deposited the amount with the City Sheriff and obtained a Certificate of Redemption [1].

Vicente filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zamboanga City, acting as a Land Registration Court, under **Section 112 of the Land Registration Act**. He sought the cancellation of the existing title and the issuance of a new one in his name [2]. De los Santos opposed, alleging that Vicente's co-owners had transferred their redemption rights to him, limiting Vicente to redeeming only his original share. De los Santos argued the court lacked jurisdiction because Section 112 proceedings are summary and unsuited for controversial issues [3]. The CFI granted the petition without receiving evidence, ruling it was "proper and in order" [4]. De los Santos appealed [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance, acting as a Land Registration Court under Section 112 of the Land Registration Act, has jurisdiction to grant relief when there is a genuine controversy between the parties.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the lower court's order. The Court held that proceedings under **Section 112 of the Land Registration Act** are summary in nature and contemplate a lack of serious objection or adverse claim [6, 7]. Relief under this section can only be granted if there is **unanimity among the parties**; otherwise, the case becomes controversial and must be litigated in an **ordinary civil action** or the appropriate proceeding where evidence can be presented and issues fully ventilated [6, 8, 9].

In this case, a genuine controversy existed regarding the extent of Vicente's right to redeem (total vs. partial) given De los Santos' claim that he acquired the rights of the other co-owners [10]. Because the CFI acting as a land registration court has limited and special jurisdiction, it erred in adjudicating this conflicting claim summarily without evidence [9].

The Order appealed from is **SET ASIDE**.
