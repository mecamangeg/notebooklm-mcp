I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. VICENTE MARQUEZ, G.R. No. L-23654, March 28, 1969, Barredo, J.

II. FACTS
On November 12, 1962, a complaint for frustrated homicide was filed against Vicente Marquez in the Justice of the Peace Court of Camalig, Albay. The complaint was signed by Consolacion Musa Solano, the mother of the offended party [1]. Marquez posted bail and waived the second stage of the preliminary investigation [1]. The case was remanded to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Albay, where the Provincial Fiscal filed an Information on July 9, 1963 [1]. Marquez was arraigned and pleaded not guilty on August 22, 1964 [2]. On the day of the trial, Marquez filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the CFI lacked jurisdiction because the initial complaint in the lower court was void for being signed by the mother instead of the offended party, in violation of Rule 110 [2], [3]. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the case [4]. The prosecution appealed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction due to the defect in the initial complaint after the accused had already pleaded to the Information.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the order of dismissal. While the initial complaint was indeed defective for being signed by the mother rather than the offended party or peace officer, the accused waived his right to question it [5], [6]. Marquez waived the preliminary investigation in the Justice of the Peace Court, allowed the remand to the CFI, and entered a plea of not guilty to the Fiscal's Information without objection [6].

The Court applied the settled doctrine that the right to a preliminary investigation is waived if not invoked before the entry of the plea (*People v. Solon*; *People v. Lambino*) [7]. Consequently, the lack of certification by the Fiscal regarding the preliminary investigation was also deemed waived [7]. Furthermore, the filing of the Information by the Fiscal, which was sufficient in form and substance under Section 3, Rule 110, superseded the initial complaint, rendering the issue of the complaint's validity academic [8].

The Order appealed from is reversed, and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [9].
