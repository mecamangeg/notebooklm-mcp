I. CAPTION
DR. HERMENEGILDO SERAFICA v. THE TREASURER OF ORMOC CITY, THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF ORMOC CITY, HON. ESTEBAN C. CONEJOS, as Mayor of Ormoc City, and ORMOC CITY, G.R. No. L-24813, April 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 110, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Ormoc City enacted Ordinance No. 13, Series of 1964, imposing a "city tax" of P5.00 for every 1,000 board feet of lumber sold at Ormoc City. Pursuant to this, the City Treasurer collected P1,837.84 from Dr. Hermenegildo Serafica, owner of Serafica Sawmill, for lumber sold during the third quarter of 1964. Serafica filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte to declare the ordinance null and void. He argued that: (1) the City Charter authorizes the regulation but not the taxation of lumber yards; (2) the ordinance constitutes double taxation; (3) the tax is unfair and arbitrary; and (4) no public hearings were held as suggested by a Department of Finance circular. The CFI dismissed the complaint and upheld the ordinance's validity. Serafica appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Ormoc City has the power to tax the sale of lumber despite the limitation on taxing forest products.
2. W/N the ordinance is void due to double taxation or lack of public hearing.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Republic Act No. 2264 (Local Autonomy Act), chartered cities have broad and plenary taxing powers, subject only to specific exceptions. While Section 2(e) of the Act prohibits local governments from imposing taxes on "forest products," this limitation does not apply to the case at bar. The tax here is imposed not upon the lumber itself (a forest product), but upon its *sale*. It does not become due until the lumber is sold. The Court distinguished this from *Golden Ribbon Lumber Co. v. City of Butuan*, where the tax was on lumber "sawn, manufactured and/or produced" regardless of sale. Furthermore, the prohibition in the Local Autonomy Act against percentage taxes on sales applies only to municipalities and municipal districts, not to cities.

2. **NO.** First, regulation and taxation are distinct powers; the former is an exercise of police power, while the latter is not. Moreover, double taxation is not prohibited in the Philippines. Second, regarding the lack of public hearing, Provincial Circular No. 24 of the Department of Finance is merely suggestive and not obligatory. Since local governments are subject only to the supervision, not control, of the President, failure to comply with the circular does not invalidate the ordinance. Finally, on the claim that the tax is unfair for not distinguishing between lumber classes, the presumption of the ordinance's validity prevails as the plaintiff failed to prove the relevant price categories.

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
