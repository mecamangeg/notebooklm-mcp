**I. CAPTION**
**ALIM BALINDONG v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS and USO DAN AGUAM** (G.R. No. L-29610) and **USO DAN AGUAM v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS and ALIM BALINDONG** (G.R. No. L-29617), March 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 567, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
In the 1967 elections for Mayor of Ganassi, Lanao del Sur, candidates included Alim Balindong (Independent Liberal) and Uso Dan Aguam (Liberal Party). On November 20, 1967, the Municipal Board of Canvassers (MBC) proclaimed Aguam as Mayor-elect with 575 votes against Balindong’s 572.

Balindong petitioned the COMELEC (Case RR-612) to annul the proclamation, alleging: (1) the MBC was illegally constituted; (2) the canvass venue was transferred to Marawi City (39km away) without proper notice; and (3) the election return for Precinct 8 was tampered with, changing Balindong’s votes from "Thirteen" (13) to "Eight" (8). If 13 votes were credited, Balindong would win by 2 votes.

The MBC substitute members were recommended by the Liberal Party, replacing disqualified members who were originally elected as Liberals but ran for reelection as Nacionalistas.

COMELEC declared the canvass and proclamation void due to the illegal board constitution and lack of notice. However, regarding Precinct 8, COMELEC directed the Board of Inspectors to file a petition for judicial correction in the CFI. Balindong challenged this directive (L-29610), arguing the original votes should be counted immediately. Aguam appealed the annulment of his proclamation (L-29617).

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the canvass and proclamation were void due to the illegal constitution of the Board of Canvassers and lack of notice.
2. W/N the COMELEC correctly directed the filing of a petition for judicial correction for the tampered returns in Precinct 8.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The canvass and proclamation are null and void. The appointment of substitute members recommended by the Liberal Party violated Section 167 of the Revised Election Code. Under the ruling in *Ibuna v. COMELEC*, substitute members must be recommendees of the political party to which the substituted members belonged *at the time of their disqualification* (in this case, the Nacionalista Party), not their party at the time of their original election. Furthermore, the transfer of the canvassing venue to Marawi City without written notice to the candidates and absent members rendered the proceedings void (*Pacis v. COMELEC*).

2. **NO.** A petition for judicial correction is a remedy left to the privilege and unanimous consent of the election inspectors (*Peña v. Tengco*); courts cannot coerce inspectors to file it. Since the return was tampered with, the proper remedy is to ascertain the original entry. The evidence, including the unaltered ballot box copy and certificates of votes issued to watchers, conclusively showed the original entry was "Thirteen" (13). The Court held that when a return is tampered but the original entries can be salvaged and ascertained, the original votes should be used for the canvass (*Pacis v. COMELEC*).

**Disposition:** The petition of Balindong in L-29610 is **GRANTED**. The COMELEC decision is **MODIFIED**: the directive to file a petition for correction is set aside, and the reconstituted Board is ordered to count 13 votes for Balindong in Precinct 8 and proclaim the winner. The petition of Aguam in L-29617 is **DENIED**.
