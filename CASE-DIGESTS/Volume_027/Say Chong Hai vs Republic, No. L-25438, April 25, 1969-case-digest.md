I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF WILLIAM SAY CHONG HAI TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. WILLIAM SAY CHONG HAI v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-25438, April 25, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner William Say Chong Hai filed a petition for naturalization. The Republic opposed the petition, noting that the petitioner used multiple aliases (e.g., "William Francisco Say," "Francisco T. Say," "Francisco Say y Ty") in official documents such as his Birth Certificate, Alien Certificate of Registration, and Income Tax Returns without judicial authority [1]. Petitioner admitted using these names interchangeably for business and community interactions [2]. To prove his moral character, petitioner presented two witnesses, Recaredo Enriquez and Zosimo C. Ella, who were his former professors at San Beda College [3]. Their knowledge of the petitioner was limited primarily to school activities and classroom interactions [3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila granted the petition, ruling that the witnesses were competent and the aliases were not a bar to citizenship [4], [5]. The Republic appealed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the unauthorized use of aliases by the petitioner is a ground to deny naturalization.
2. W/N the petitioner's former professors were competent and credible character witnesses under the Naturalization Law.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The unexplained and unauthorized use of an alias is sufficient to deny a petition for naturalization [2]. The Court held that such acts indicate the petitioner has not conducted himself in a "proper and irreproachable manner" [2]. Citing *Ang Tee Ye v. Republic* and *Wang I Fu v. Republic*, the Court emphasized that the use of an alias without judicial authority is fatal to the application and renders the applicant unworthy of Philippine citizenship [2], [6].

2. **NO.** Character witnesses must be insurers of the applicant's character, necessitating that they be competent and reliable [7]. They must have had the opportunity to observe the applicant personally, if not intimately, during the requisite period [8]. The Court ruled that professors whose acquaintance with a student is limited to school activities do not possess the necessary degree of certainty regarding the applicant's moral fitness and qualifications [9]. Citing *Lim Ching Tian v. Republic* and *Ong Ling Chuan v. Republic*, the Court reiterated that testimony from tutors or professors is generally insufficient to satisfy the law's requirements [8], [10].

Accordingly, the appealed decision is **REVERSED** [10].
