I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. WILLIAM J. SUTER and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-25532, February 28, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J. [1]

II. FACTS
On September 30, 1947, William J. Suter (general partner), Julia Spirig, and Gustav Carlson (limited partners) formed a limited partnership named "William J. Suter 'Morcoin' Co., Ltd." with contributions of P20,000.00, P18,000.00, and P2,000.00, respectively [2]. In 1948, Suter and Spirig got married, and Carlson sold his share to the couple [3]. The partnership filed income tax returns as a corporation [3]. In 1959, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) issued a deficiency income tax assessment for the years 1954 and 1955, consolidating the income of the partnership with the individual incomes of the spouses Suter and Spirig [3]. The CIR argued that the marriage dissolved the partnership or that the partnership's personality should be disregarded as it became a single proprietorship controlled by the spouses [4]. Suter protested, but the CIR denied it. Suter appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), which reversed the CIR's decision [5]. The CIR filed this petition for review [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the limited partnership was dissolved by the marriage of the partners Suter and Spirig.
2. W/N the separate juridical personality of the partnership should be disregarded for income tax purposes, consolidating its income with that of the spouses.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the partnership was not a universal partnership, but a *particular* one, as the contributions were fixed sums of money and not "all present property" or "all that the partners may acquire," which are prohibited between spouses under the Spanish Civil Code (Article 1677) [6]. Furthermore, the subsequent marriage of the partners is not one of the causes provided for dissolution of a partnership under the Spanish Civil Code or the Code of Commerce [7].

2. **NO.** The limited partnership has a juridical personality distinct and separate from its partners [8]. While Section 24 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) merges registered general co-partnerships (*compañias colectivas*) with the personality of individual partners, this rule does not apply to limited partnerships [9]. The NIRC expressly taxes limited partnerships on their income, unlike general co-partnerships where members are taxed individually [9]. The capital contributions remained separate property of the spouses [7]. To consolidate the income would violate the tax code which requires the limited partnership to pay tax on its own income [10], [11].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [11].
