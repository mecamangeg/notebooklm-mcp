I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FILOMENO VACAL and FIDENCIO VACAL, G.R. No. L-20913, February 27, 1969, 27 SCRA 24, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
On the starry night of March 20, 1960, at about 10:00 PM, the victim Ignacio Ruiz was walking single file with three companions (Baclayon, Musico, and Humangit) on a trail in Hinunangan, Southern Leyte [1]. Appellant Filomeno Vacal suddenly appeared near Ruiz's right side and shot him dead with a pistol [1]. The witnesses, who knew the appellant well, positively identified him by the light of the stars [1, 2]. The motive was traced to a land dispute between Vacal and Ruiz [3].

The Court of First Instance of Southern Leyte convicted Filomeno Vacal of murder (his co-accused Fidencio Vacal was acquitted) [4, 5]. The trial court appreciated the qualifying circumstance of treachery, and offset the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity with the mitigating circumstance of passion and obfuscation [5]. Vacal appealed, arguing insufficient identification due to darkness and delay in witness reporting, and interposed an alibi that he was at a baptismal party [2, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused was positively identified despite the alleged poor visibility and delay in reporting.
2. W/N the defense of alibi merits consideration.
3. W/N the qualifying circumstance of treachery and the modifying circumstances of nocturnity and passion/obfuscation were correctly appreciated.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held the identification was sufficient. The witnesses knew the appellant well and testified that the stars were shining, providing fair visibility [2]. The fact that the murderer was able to recognize and single out his victim from among four pedestrians proves visibility was sufficient [2]. Furthermore, the delay of witnesses in reporting the crime to authorities until questioned does not overcome their positive identification of the appellant [2].

2. **NO.** The claim that the accused was at a baptismal party was rejected because none of the prominent visitors (e.g., the Mayor) allegedly present testified to support his alibi [6].

3. **YES** (as to Treachery) and **NO** (as to Nocturnity and Passion/Obfuscation). Treachery was present because there was absolutely no defense against the sudden pistol shot that caused instantaneous death [7]. However, the lower court erred regarding the other circumstances. Nocturnity was not aggravating because there was no evidence the accused purposely sought the nighttime to commit the crime [7]. Similarly, there was no evidence to establish passion and obfuscation as a mitigating circumstance [7].

**Judgment sentencing appellant to *reclusion perpetua* is AFFIRMED, with the modification that the indemnity to the heirs is increased from P3,000 to P12,000.** [8]
