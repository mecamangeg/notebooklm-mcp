I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. PACIFIC COMMISSION HOUSE, G.R. No. L-22675, March 28, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On February 3, 1953, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a judgment in favor of Philippine National Bank (PNB) against Pacific Commission House [1]. On May 31, 1963, PNB filed a complaint to revive said judgment [1]. Pacific Commission House failed to answer and was declared in default [1]. However, the trial court dismissed the complaint *motu proprio*, ruling that the action had prescribed because more than ten years had elapsed from the judgment entry to the filing of the revival action [2, 3]. PNB appealed, arguing that the defense of prescription was waived since the defendant did not plead it, and that a partial payment made by the defendant on September 29, 1954, interrupted the prescriptive period [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court may *motu proprio* dismiss the complaint on the ground of prescription despite the defendant's failure to plead it.
2. W/N a partial payment interrupts the prescriptive period for an action to revive a judgment.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While the general rule is that defenses not pleaded are deemed waived, this does not apply when the plaintiff's own allegations or evidence clearly show that the action has prescribed [5]. Here, the complaint itself disclosed the dates—judgment on February 3, 1953, and filing on May 31, 1963—proving the ten-year period had expired [6]. Citing *Philippine National Bank v. Perez* and *Chua Lamko v. Dioso*, the Court held that where the dates are not denied and no issue of fact exists regarding the timeline, the failure to plead prescription does not constitute a waiver [5-7].

2. **NO.** Article 1155 of the Civil Code, which provides that prescription is interrupted by acknowledgment of the debt (such as payment), applies to actions based on contracts, not actions to enforce or revive final judgments [4, 8]. A judgment is a final judicial decree, and an acknowledgment by the debtor does not render the adjudication any stronger [4]. Relying on *Philippine National Bank v. Osete*, the Court affirmed that the "renovating effect" of payment or acknowledgment is limited to debts founded upon contract and does not extend to debts already confirmed by judgment [8, 9].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [10].
