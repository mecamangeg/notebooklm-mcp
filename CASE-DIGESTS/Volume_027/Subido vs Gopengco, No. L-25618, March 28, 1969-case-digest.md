I. CAPTION
ABELARDO SUBIDO, as Commissioner of Civil Service, and ALIPIO BUENAVENTURA, as Executive Director, Civil Service Commission v. HON. SIMEON GOPENGCO, Judge, Court of First Instance of Manila and FAUSTO VARELA, G.R. No. L-25618, March 28, 1969, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Fausto Varela, the Deputy Commissioner of Civil Service, was suspended from office by the President on February 21, 1962, facing charges of grave misconduct and insubordination [1]. Although reinstated in the service on September 28, 1962, he was detailed to various offices of lower rank rather than his original position [2]. On November 11, 1965, Varela filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against petitioners, claiming his reassignment was a removal without cause [1]. Judge Gopengco issued a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction on November 18, 1965, ordering Varela's reinstatement to his former position [3].

Subsequently, on December 21, 1965, the President issued Administrative Order No. 171 finding Varela guilty and considering him resigned from the service [4]. Petitioners moved to dissolve the injunction as the case had become moot, but the CFI denied the motion and on January 4, 1966, issued an order enjoining the enforcement of the President’s administrative order [5], [6]. Petitioners filed the instant action to set aside the CFI's orders [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the issuance of the preliminary mandatory injunction directing Varela's reinstatement was proper.
2. W/N the administrative decision dismissing Varela could be executed pending a motion for reconsideration.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The issuance of a mandatory injunction is the exception rather than the rule and requires the applicant to show a clear legal right and extreme urgency [7], [8]. Varela failed to show a clear right because his detail was temporary and he retained his rank and salary [9]. Under Section 35 of the Civil Service Act of 1959, an employee not reinstated within 60 days of suspension is entitled to reinstatement in the "service," but not necessarily to his specific former "position" unless exonerated [9]. Furthermore, there was no urgency as Varela waited three years from his 1962 reassignment before filing suit in 1965 [2].

2. **YES.** Decisions in administrative disciplinary cases may be executed even before they become final. Public interest would be jeopardized if the government were forced to retain an employee adjudged unfit for service during the pendency of a motion for reconsideration [10]. Consequently, the lower court should have dissolved the mandatory injunction upon the promulgation of Administrative Order No. 171, as the supervening administrative decision rendered the injunction untenable [11], [12].

Petition GRANTED. The orders and writ of preliminary mandatory injunction are SET ASIDE [13].
