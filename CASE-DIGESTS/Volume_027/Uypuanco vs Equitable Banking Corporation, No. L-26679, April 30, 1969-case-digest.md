I. CAPTION
JOAQUIN UYPUANCO v. EQUITABLE BANKING CORPORATION, ET AL., G.R. No. L-26679, April 30, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Equitable Banking Corporation sued Joaquin Uypuanco and others in the Municipal Court of Manila to collect an outstanding loan balance of P4,500.00. The complaint alleged in Paragraph 2 that the defendants stipulated to pay 10% attorney's fees in the promissory note. Paragraph 4 subsequently stated that due to the defendants' refusal to pay, they incurred "a further liability" of 10% of the amount due as attorney's fees. The Municipal Court ruled in favor of the bank. Uypuanco opposed the execution, arguing that the Municipal Court lacked jurisdiction. He contended that the complaint demanded the 10% mentioned in Paragraph 2 *plus* the 10% in Paragraph 4, which, added to the principal, exceeded the P5,000.00 jurisdictional limit of municipal courts under Republic Act No. 2613. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila rejected Uypuanco's petition for certiorari and prohibition, ruling that the total claim was only P4,950.00. Uypuanco appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipal Court had jurisdiction over the amount claimed in the complaint.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, declaring the appeal absolutely devoid of merit. The Court explained that a reading of the complaint reveals that Paragraph 2 merely avers the terms of the promissory note, while Paragraphs 3 and 4 allege the actual amounts due by reason of the default. The "further liability" of 10% alleged in Paragraph 4 is the same fee referred to in Paragraph 2, not an additional amount. Thus, the claim was for P4,500.00 plus 10% attorney's fees (P450.00), totaling P4,950.00, which was within the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court under Republic Act No. 2613. The Court condemned the appeal as frivolous and a "plain trick to delay payment," ordering the appellant's counsel to pay treble costs.

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
