I. CAPTION
JULIO CHUA LIAN YAN alias JULIO FRANCES v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-26416, April 25, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Julio Chua Lian Yan filed a petition for naturalization, which was initially granted by the Court of First Instance of Rizal in 1961. However, before he could take his oath, the Solicitor General objected in 1965. The lower court subsequently dismissed the petition.

The records showed that the petitioner's only minor child, Chua Bun Huy, was born in China and resided in Hong Kong, arriving in the Philippines only in October 1960. Upon arrival, the petitioner enrolled the child in a Chinese school (Philippine Sun Yat Sen High School) for two school years before transferring him to Paco Catholic School. The petitioner claimed he had difficulties bringing the child to the Philippines earlier. Additionally, the petitioner did not file a declaration of intention. His reported annual income was only P6,000.00 while supporting a wife and child. Furthermore, he failed to disclose in his petition his former places of residence in Tondo, Manila, and Goa, Camarines Sur, which were revealed during the testimony of witnesses.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner complied with the mandatory education requirement for his minor child.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative income.
3. W/N the failure to disclose former places of residence is fatal to the petition.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petitioner failed to enroll his child in a Philippine school "during the entire period of the residence in the Philippines required of him prior to the hearing" as required by Paragraph 6, Section 2 of the Revised Naturalization Law [1]. His excuse regarding the difficulty of bringing the child to the country is unavailing because the policy of the law is for children to imbibe Filipino customs and traditions as early as possible [2]. Furthermore, enrolling the child in a Chinese school evinced a lack of sincere desire to embrace Filipino customs and identify with the Filipino community (*Dy v. Republic*) [3]. Since he failed the education requirement, he was also not exempt from filing a declaration of intention [4].

2. **NO.** An annual income of P6,000.00 for an applicant who is married with one child to support does not rise to the level of "lucrative" within the meaning of the law. The Court previously held that even P6,300.00 was insufficient for a similarly situated applicant (*Tan v. Republic*) [5].

3. **YES.** Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law mandates the inclusion of "present and former places of residence." This requirement is fatal if not followed because non-disclosure deprives the public and the government of a fair opportunity to check the petitioner's activities and register objections (*Yap Puey Eng v. Republic*). Residence encompasses all places where the petitioner actually and physically resided [6, 7].

The orders dismissing the petition are **AFFIRMED** [8].
