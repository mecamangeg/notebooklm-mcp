I. CAPTION
SECRETARY OF FINANCE EDUARDO Z. ROMUALDEZ, COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS JACINTO GAVINO and MANILA COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS PEDRO PACIS v. HON. FRANCISCO ARCA, NORBERTO DE LA MERCED and NESTOR DE LA MERCED, G.R. No. L-25924, April 18, 1969, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
In early 1966, petitioner Secretary of Finance Romualdez affirmed a memorandum regarding the dutiable valuations of imported textile remnants [1, 2]. Consequently, the Commissioner of Customs issued a memorandum directing all collectors to observe these new values [2]. Respondents Norberto and Nestor de la Merced, importers of remnants, filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, presided by respondent Judge Arca, claiming they were aggrieved by the new valuations [2, 3]. The petitioners moved to dismiss, arguing the CFI lacked jurisdiction, but Judge Arca denied the motion and issued a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the enforcement of the dutiable values [3, 4]. Petitioners filed the present recourse, arguing that jurisdiction lies with the Court of Tax Appeals under Republic Act No. 1125 [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the petition to nullify the Secretary of Finance's memorandum.
2. W/N the Secretary of Finance has the authority to issue the memorandum fixing dutiable values.
3. W/N the memorandum is void for lack of publication.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of First Instance has jurisdiction. The respondents' suit did not seek a review of a specific decision of the Commissioner of Customs involving disputed assessments or customs duties, which would fall under the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals under Section 7 of R.A. 1125 [5, 6]. Instead, the action sought the nullification of the Secretary of Finance's memorandum on the ground that it violated the Tariff and Customs Code [6]. Therefore, it is an action for certiorari and prohibition, jurisdiction over which belongs to the Court of First Instance under Section 44(h) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 [6, 7].

2. **YES.** The Secretary of Finance has the power to issue the memorandum under Section 79(B) of the Revised Administrative Code [7]. The memorandum serves as a "value information" guideline for customs appraisers to determine the correct market value of remnants and ensures the strict enforcement of laws under the Department's jurisdiction [8]. The Court likened this to the regulation upheld in *Interprovincial Autobus Co. v. Collector of Internal Revenue*, noting that such administrative regulations have the force and effect of law [9, 10].

3. **NO.** Publication is not necessary for the validity of the memorandum. The memorandum is neither a statute nor an implementation of a law authorizing its issuance, and it does not prescribe any penalty for its violation [11]. Citing *People v. Que Po Lay* and *Victorias Milling Co. v. Social Security Commission*, the Court held that since it is merely an internal guideline for subordinates, publication is not required [11, 12].

The petition is granted, the preliminary injunction is dissolved, and the respondent court is ordered to dismiss the civil case [13].
