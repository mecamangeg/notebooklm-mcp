I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS and VICENTE KHO, G.R. No. L-21483, April 28, 1969, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
On October 20, 1952, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) sent a letter to respondent Vicente Kho demanding payment of deficiency income tax for 1951 amounting to P1,128,444.00 [1, 2]. Although initially not served effectively due to Kho’s change of address, Kho eventually received the letter-decision personally on January 25, 1954 [3, 4]. Prior to this, Kho’s counsel had requested a reconsideration/compromise, but on April 29, 1953, the Deputy CIR wrote advising that the office could not reconsider its decision [5, 6].

Republic Act No. 1125, creating the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), took effect on June 16, 1954, and the court was formally organized on July 21, 1954 [7, 8]. Kho did not file an appeal immediately. It was only on August 25, 1962—eight years later—that Kho filed a petition for review with the CTA [9]. The CIR filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the appeal was filed out of time and the CTA lacked jurisdiction [10, 11]. The CTA denied the motion, ruling that the records were unclear regarding the filing period [11]. The CIR filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court [10].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Tax Appeals has jurisdiction over the petition for review filed by the respondent taxpayer.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court of Tax Appeals lacks jurisdiction because the petition for review was filed out of time [9].

The Supreme Court held that the letter dated October 20, 1952, constituted the appealable decision of the CIR [2]. The subsequent letter from the Deputy CIR on April 29, 1953, constituted the denial of the respondent's motion for reconsideration [6]. Although the respondent personally received the assessment only on January 25, 1954, he was given an opportunity to appeal upon the enactment of Republic Act No. 1125 [8]. Citing *Sta. Clara Lumber Co., Inc. v. Court of Tax Appeals* and *Lim Tio Dy Hong v. Court of Tax Appeals*, the Court ruled that an appeal from the Commissioner's decision could be perfected within 30 days from the formal organization of the CTA [8].

Since the CTA was organized on July 21, 1954, Kho had until August 21, 1954, to perfect his appeal [8]. However, he filed his petition only on August 25, 1962, which is clearly beyond the statutory period [9]. Consequently, the tax court had no jurisdiction to try the case [9].

Petition granted and orders set aside [12].
