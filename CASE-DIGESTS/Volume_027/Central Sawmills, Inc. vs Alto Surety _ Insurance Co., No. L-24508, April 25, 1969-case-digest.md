I. CAPTION
CENTRAL SAWMILLS, INC. v. ALTO SURETY & INSURANCE CO., G.R. No. L-24508, April 25, 1969, 27 SCRA 998, Barredo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Central Sawmills, Inc. obtained a final and executory judgment for a sum of money against respondent Alto Surety & Insurance Co. [1]. A writ of execution was issued to enforce the judgment but was returned unsatisfied by the Sheriff [1]. Letters from the Insurance Commissioner revealed that Alto Surety was in a precarious financial condition and in imminent danger of insolvency [2-4]. Consequently, Central Sawmills filed a petition for receivership in the Court of First Instance of Manila to aid in the execution of the judgment [5, 6]. The trial court granted the petition [5]. Alto Surety appealed, arguing that the trial court lacked authority to appoint a receiver because the properties involved were not the "subject of the action" as required by Section 1(d), Rule 61 of the Rules of Court (1940) [7]. The Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved a pure question of law [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may appoint a receiver for a corporation's properties in aid of execution of a final judgment, even if said properties are not the subject of the action.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's orders. The Court held that the applicable provision is **Section 39 of Rule 39** of the Rules of 1940 (now Section 43 of Rule 39 of the Revised Rules), which expressly authorizes the appointment of a receiver for the property of a judgment debtor in aid of execution [9, 10].

The Court distinguished this from **Section 1(d) of Rule 61** (now Rule 59), which was deemed inapplicable because it governs receivership only when the specific property is the "subject of the action" [11]. Likewise, **Section 2 of Rule 61** was inapplicable as it applies to receivership consequent to corporate dissolution or insolvency proceedings, not as an auxiliary remedy in an ordinary collection suit [12, 13]. Citing *Philippine Trust Co. v. Santamaria*, the Court ruled that when a judgment debtor has defeated collection efforts and is in danger of insolvency, it is the court's duty to appoint a receiver to preserve the assets for the creditors [14, 15].

Orders affirmed [10].
