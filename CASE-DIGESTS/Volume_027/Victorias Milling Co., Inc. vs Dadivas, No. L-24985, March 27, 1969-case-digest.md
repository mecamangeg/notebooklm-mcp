I. CAPTION
VICTORIAS MILLING CO., INC. v. BERTITO D. DADIVAS, as Acting Referee, Department of Labor, et al., G.R. No. L-24985, March 27, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Rufino Pineda filed a claim for compensation with the Department of Labor's Sub-Regional Office on October 18, 1961, alleging he was discharged from Victorias Milling Co., Inc. (Petitioner) in November 1952 due to pulmonary tuberculosis contracted during his employment [1]. Petitioner moved to dismiss the claim, arguing it was filed nine years after the illness, far beyond the two-month period prescribed by Section 24 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act (Act 3428) [1]. Respondent Acting Referee Bertito D. Dadivas denied the motion [1]. Petitioner then filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental to restrain Dadivas from hearing the case, alleging lack of jurisdiction due to the late filing [1]. The trial court dismissed the petition, ruling that the late filing did not affect jurisdiction [1]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Workmen’s Compensation Commission loses jurisdiction to hear a claim filed beyond the two-month period prescribed in Section 24 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order, ruling that the filing of a claim within the two-month period is essential for the claim to "prosper" (i.e., for the claimant's success) but is not a requirement for jurisdiction [3]. The Court held that the late filing of a claim is merely a matter of defense, which can be waived [4].

Under Section 45 of Act 3428, an employer must file a notice of controversion on or before the fourteenth day of disability or within ten days after having knowledge of the accident [5]. Failure to strictly comply with this requirement constitutes a renunciation of the right to controvert the claim, barring all defenses, including the defense that the claim was filed out of time [5, 6]. In this case, the Petitioner failed to file either a report of injury or a notice of controversion within the prescribed periods, effectively waiving its right to question the late filing of Pineda's claim [7, 8].

The Order of the Court of First Instance dismissing the petition for prohibition is **AFFIRMED** [9].
