I. CAPTION
FELIX LIMON v. MRS. ALEJO CANDIDO, PETRONILA CANDIDO, and THE HEIRS OF ALEJO CANDIDO, G.R. No. L-22418, April 28, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellant Felix Limon originally filed an ejectment case against defendants-appellees (Candidos) in the City Court of Caloocan, where he secured a favorable decision [1]. The defendants appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal. During the initial hearing scheduled on July 5, 1963, only Limon's counsel appeared [1]. Because Limon was absent, his counsel manifested he was not ready for trial. The defense moved to dismiss the case [1]. The CFI granted the dismissal, viewing Limon’s absence as a sign of "lack of interest" [1].

Limon filed a motion for reconsideration, explaining that his failure to appear was due to sickness, supported by a medical certificate [2]. He argued he had no intention to delay as he had already won in the lower court and the defendants remained in possession of the property [3]. The CFI denied the motion and a subsequent one, prompting this appeal to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court gravely abused its discretion in dismissing the case due to the plaintiff's absence at the initial hearing.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the order of dismissal. The Court held that the plaintiff's absence at the initial hearing, while his counsel was present, was not a "positive manifestation of lack of interest" [3]. It was illogical to assume the plaintiff wanted to delay the case, as he had already won in the inferior court and the defendants were the ones in possession of the premises [3]. Furthermore, the plaintiff's explanation of sickness, attested to by a medical certificate, was reasonable and sufficient to excuse his non-appearance [4, 5].

While the allowance of postponements rests on judicial discretion, such discretion must serve the ends of justice and fairness, not merely the convenience of the court [5]. Citing *Panganiban v. Vda. de Sta. Maria*, the Court ruled that when no substantial rights are affected and there is no manifest intent to delay, a motion to transfer hearing should be allowed [5]. Additionally, relying on *Macasa v. Herrera*, the Court emphasized that "inconsiderate dismissals" do not solve docket congestion and that justice is better served by a brief continuance and trial on the merits [5, 6].

The order of dismissal was set aside, and the case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [6].
