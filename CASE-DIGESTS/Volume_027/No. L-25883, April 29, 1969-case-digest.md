I. CAPTION
CALTEX (PHILIPPINES), INC. v. CALTEX DEALERS ASSOCIATION OF THE PHILIPPINES, INC. and THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-25883, April 29, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Caltex Dealers Association (the Association) filed a case for unfair labor practice against petitioner Caltex (Philippines), Inc. (Caltex) for the latter's refusal to bargain. Caltex defended that it had no obligation to bargain because no employer-employee relationship existed, claiming the association members were independent contractors [1].

During the hearing, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) issued a subpoena *duces tecum* requiring Caltex to produce "DAPLs" (District Authorized Price Letters). Subsequently, the CIR issued a second subpoena for similar documents covering different dealers and specific years (1964-1965) [1], [2]. Caltex moved to quash this second subpoena, arguing the documents were immaterial, merely cumulative, unreasonable/oppressive, and constituted "fishing for evidence." The CIR denied the motion to quash and the subsequent motion for reconsideration [2]. Caltex appealed via certiorari.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the second subpoena *duces tecum* issued by the CIR was valid.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's order [3].

First, the documents are **material**. Caltex previously produced similar documents under a first subpoena without claiming they were immaterial; thus, it is estopped from claiming documents of the same nature in the second subpoena are immaterial [4].

Second, the documents are **not cumulative**. The first batch covered dealers under one supervisor, while the second batch covered a different area. The documents are necessary to prove the extent of control Caltex exercised in that specific area, which may differ from others [5], [6].

Third, the subpoena is **not unreasonable or oppressive**. The Association proved the documents were definite, particularized, referred to specific periods, and were actually fewer in number than those previously produced [7], [8].

Finally, **"fishing for evidence" is allowed**. Under the Rules of Court on Discovery and Deposition, fishing for evidence is permitted to enable litigants to prepare for trial and simplify issues [7]. If this is allowed in regular courts, *a fortiori* (with greater reason) it is allowed in the CIR, which is not strictly bound by ordinary rules of procedure [9], [8].

The order and resolution affirmed [3].
