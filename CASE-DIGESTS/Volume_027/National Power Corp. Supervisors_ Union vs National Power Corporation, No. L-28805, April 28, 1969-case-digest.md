I. CAPTION
NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION SUPERVISORS' UNION v. NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION, NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION EMPLOYEES & WORKERS ASSOCIATION, ATTY. SIMPLICIO S. BALCOS and HONORABLE JUDGE ARSENIO MARTINEZ, G.R. No. L-28805, April 28, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On April 16, 1968, the Supreme Court issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the National Power Corporation (NPC) from deducting 20% attorney's fees payable to Atty. Simplicio S. Balcos from the salary differentials or increases of NPC supervisors. The writ also restrained the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) from conducting further proceedings in Case No. 81-IPA insofar as it involved the petitioner, NPC Supervisors' Union [1].

On February 28, 1969, Carmen Quilop and others filed a motion seeking clarification on whether the injunction applied to them. They requested authorization for the CIR to proceed with hearings to determine their pay under Republic Act No. 4657 (Teves Law) and the existing Collective Bargaining Agreement [2]. These hearings had previously been stalled because the NPC Employees & Workers Association objected, claiming such proceedings would violate the Supreme Court's injunction [3]. The petitioner Union commented that it was not concerned with proceedings involving non-members as long as its rights were not affected [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR hearings to determine the pay or supervisory status of movants (Quilop et al.) violate the Supreme Court's preliminary injunction.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the hearings intended by the CIR to determine the pay to be received by the movants, or even to determine their status as supervisors, will not violate the writ of preliminary injunction [5].

The Court reasoned that the injunction specifically restrains deductions for attorney's fees from the supervisors' salaries and proceedings that involve or affect the petitioner Union [5]. Therefore, the CIR may proceed with the hearings for the movants provided no order is issued requiring deductions from the petitioner's members' salaries or granting relief adversely affecting the petitioner [5]. The Court resolved the motion by clarifying the limited scope of the injunction [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
