I. CAPTION
SY SUAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-23470, February 28, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Sy Suan filed a petition for naturalization on September 4, 1958, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Rizal [1, 2]. The Republic appealed, challenging the petitioner's qualifications on several grounds [3].

First, regarding residence, the petition only listed his present residence in Malabon and one former residence on Magdalena St., Manila. However, Sy Suan testified that since his arrival in 1923, he had also resided at T. Pinpin, Tetuan, and Platerias Streets in Manila, which were not stated in his petition [2].

Second, regarding conduct, Sy Suan was administratively fined in 1952 for the late registration of his daughter. Despite this warning, he failed to register his son Henry (born in 1945) until 1959—over 14 years late and after the petition was filed—resulting in another fine [4].

Third, regarding income, Sy Suan reported an annual income of P9,600.00 from 1957 to 1959. He had a wife and eleven children, with several attending college and school [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to state all former places of residence in the petition is fatal.
2. W/N the petitioner conducted himself in an irreproachable manner despite violating the Alien Registration Act.
3. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade, profession, or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The failure to state all former places of residence constitutes a violation of Section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 473. This omission is fatal to the jurisdiction of the Court to hear and grant the petition [2, 6, 7].

2. **NO.** The petitioner failed to conduct himself in an irreproachable manner. The prior fine for the late registration of his daughter should have been sufficient warning. His failure to register his son until over seven years after that warning reveals "little respect for our laws." Failure to comply with the Alien Registration Act proves lack of irreproachable conduct, citing *Cu v. Republic* [4, 8, 9].

3. **NO.** The petitioner's income is not considered lucrative. Earning P9,600.00 a year is insufficient for an applicant with a wife and eleven children (four in college, one in high school, and three in grade school). The Court relied on *Keng Giok v. Republic*, where a similar income for a smaller family was deemed non-lucrative [5, 10].

**Decision reversed and petition for naturalization denied.** [11]
