I. CAPTION
PAN AMERICAN WORLD AIRWAYS, INC. v. PAN AMERICAN EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION, G.R. No. L-25094, April 29, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On August 25, 1965, respondent Pan American Employees Association (Union) filed a notice of strike and subsequently declared a strike on August 28 against petitioner Pan American World Airways, Inc. On September 17, 1965, the President certified the dispute to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). During conciliation, the Union refused to resume work unless its officers were included in the return-to-work order. Petitioner agreed to readmit the strikers but excluded five Union officials, alleging they were responsible for an illegal strike and their loss of motivation might cause them to sabotage operations or cause injury to the company. Petitioner offered to pay their salaries while prohibiting them from working. On September 28, 1965, the CIR issued an order requiring petitioner to accept the five officials pending the resolution of the dispute. Petitioner moved for reconsideration, which was denied, prompting this petition for certiorari alleging grave abuse of discretion.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR committed grave abuse of discretion in ordering the return to work of the five union officials pending the resolution of the dispute.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) possesses broad authority in exercising compulsory arbitration in cases certified by the President under Section 10 of Republic Act No. 875. Citing *Phil. Marine Radio Officers’ Assn. v. Court of Industrial Relations*, the Court held that the CIR has the power to fix terms and conditions of employment, which includes ordering the return of workers as a solution to an industrial dispute.

The Court found petitioner’s refusal to readmit the officials based on fears of sabotage to be purely speculative and devoid of record evidence. Such distrust calls into question the integrity of the collective bargaining process. Furthermore, excluding the officials violates the laborers' constitutional and statutory right to self-organization. This freedom would be rendered nugatory if employees could not choose their own leaders. The offer to pay salaries without work was deemed insulting and did not cure the impairment of the Union's rights.

Petition denied.
