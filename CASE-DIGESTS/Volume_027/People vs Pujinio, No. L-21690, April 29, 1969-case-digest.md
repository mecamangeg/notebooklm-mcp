I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. EPIFANIO PUJINIO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21690, April 29, 1969, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On February 18, 1963, in San Fernando, Cebu, Epifanio Pujinio, Eladio Pacquiao, and Sofonias Balbuena entered the dwelling of Aquilino Sebial. They shot Sebial, who died from the wounds, and stole a transistor radio and cash. Pujinio was charged with Robbery with Homicide. Initially pleading not guilty, he later changed his plea to guilty, provided he could prove the mitigating circumstances of extreme poverty and lack of instruction. He also contended that he should only be guilty of robbery because his companion, Balbuena, was the one who killed the victim. The Court of First Instance of Cebu found him guilty of Robbery with Homicide with six aggravating circumstances (including recidivism) and only one mitigating circumstance (plea of guilty), sentencing him to death. The case was elevated for automatic review.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused is liable for robbery with homicide even if he claims he did not kill the victim.
2. W/N the mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction should be appreciated.
3. W/N the mitigating circumstance of extreme poverty should be appreciated.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that one who participated in the commission of the crime of robbery in connection with which homicide was also committed will be equally guilty as a principal of the crime of robbery with homicide, unless there is clear evidence that he tried to prevent the commission of the latter offense. Even assuming Pujinio testified that another person killed the victim, it does not justify a finding that he is guilty only of robbery absent proof he tried to stop the killing, citing *People v. Morados* (70 Phil. 558) and *People v. Carunungan* (G.R. No. L-13283).

2. **NO.** The Court affirmed the lower court's opinion that having studied up to the sixth grade is more than sufficient schooling to give the accused a degree of instruction to properly apprise him of what is right and wrong.

3. **NO.** The accused admitted his mother owns real properties on which he could have worked. Furthermore, he previously held employment with Caltex in 1960, which he lost when he embarked on a "career of criminality." Thus, he was not driven to crime by want and poverty.

The decision of the lower court imposing the death penalty is AFFIRMED.
