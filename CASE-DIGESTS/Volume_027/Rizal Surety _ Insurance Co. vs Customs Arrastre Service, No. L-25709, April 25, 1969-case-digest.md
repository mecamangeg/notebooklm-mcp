**I. CAPTION**
RIZAL SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY v. CUSTOMS ARRASTRE SERVICE and/or BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-25709, April 25, 1969, Teehankee, J.

**II. FACTS**
On December 8, 1962, cargo consigned to Edward Manufacturing Corporation arrived in Manila on board the "SS Pioneer Ming" and was discharged into the custody of the Customs Arrastre Service, operated by the Bureau of Customs. On December 22, 1962, the cargo was destroyed by a fire that gutted Shed B, Pier 9, resulting in its non-delivery. Rizal Surety & Insurance Company, as the insurer, paid the consignee P2,535.39 and, as subrogee, filed an action for recovery against the Customs Arrastre Service and the Bureau of Customs in the City Court of Manila. The City Court ruled in favor of Rizal Surety. However, on appeal, the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that the obligation was extinguished by the fire and that the defendants were immune from suit. Rizal Surety appealed to the Supreme Court on a question of law [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Bureau of Customs, in operating the arrastre service, is immune from suit.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Bureau of Customs is immune from suit. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service*, holding that the Bureau of Customs is part of the Department of Finance with no legal personality of its own apart from the national government [2], [3]. Its primary function is governmental—assessing and collecting revenues—and the arrastre service is a necessary incident to this function [3]. The fact that a non-corporate government entity performs a proprietary function (like arrastre service) does not result in a waiver of immunity if such function is incidental to its governmental duties [4]. Sovereign immunity granted as to the end should not be denied as to the necessary means to that end [5]. The proper remedy for the plaintiff is to file a money claim with the General Auditing Office under Commonwealth Act No. 327 [6].

The judgment of the lower court dismissing the complaint is affirmed [7].
