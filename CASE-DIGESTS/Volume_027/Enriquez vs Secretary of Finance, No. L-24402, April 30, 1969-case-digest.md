I. CAPTION
PEDRO V.C. ENRIQUEZ v. THE HON. SECRETARY OF FINANCE, PASAY CITY ASSESSOR and PASAY CITY TREASURER, G.R. No. L-24402, April 30, 1969, Teehankee, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Enriquez, a real estate owner in Pasay City, appealed the 1960 tax assessment of his property (P13,340.00) to the City Board of Tax Appeals (CBTA), which reduced it to P9,695.00 [1]. Subsequently, the respondent Secretary of Finance reopened the CBTA resolution for review pursuant to Section 42 of the Pasay City Charter (R.A. 183, as amended by R.A. 3275) [1, 2]. Enriquez filed an action for declaratory relief with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pasay, arguing that the Secretary was divested of the authority to review CBTA decisions by R.A. 1125, which created the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) and vested it with exclusive appellate jurisdiction over assessment cases [2]. The CFI dismissed the petition for lack of merit [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Secretary of Finance retained the authority to administratively review decisions of the Pasay City Board of Tax Appeals despite the enactment of R.A. 1125.
2. W/N Section 42 of the Pasay City Charter constitutes unconstitutional class legislation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Secretary of Finance retained the authority to review. R.A. 3275, which amended the Pasay City Charter and expressly retained the Secretary's power of review, was enacted on June 17, 1961, much later than the approval of R.A. 1125 in 1954 [3]. This later enactment manifests a clear legislative intent to preserve the Secretary's power of administrative review [4]. Furthermore, there is no irreconcilable conflict between the statutes: the Secretary exercises *administrative review* (motu proprio or upon petition), whereas the CTA exercises *judicial review* by appeal [5]. A taxpayer dissatisfied with the Secretary's administrative review still retains the right to seek judicial review with the CTA [6].

2. **NO.** The provision is not unconstitutional. Municipal corporations are "mere creatures of Congress" and possess only such powers as Congress deems fit to grant [6]. The fact that the Pasay City Charter subjects its Board's decisions to the Secretary's review, while other city charters may not, is a matter of legislative discretion [6]. Citing *Unson v. Lacson*, the Court held that the equal protection clause cannot be invoked by a municipal corporation to complain against a difference in the grant of jurisdiction or functions compared to other corporations [6].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [7].
