I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE ASSOCIATION OF FREE LABOR UNIONS (PAFLU) v. JUDGE GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL, WELLINGTON INVESTMENT & MANUFACTURING CORPORATION, and METROPOLITAN BANK & TRUST COMPANY, G.R. No. L-25878, March 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 465, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner PAFLU declared a strike against respondent Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company (METBANK), located on the ground floor of the Wellington Building in Binondo, Manila. The union picketed the building's common passageway, which was the only ingress and egress for the occupants of the second to sixth floors. Wellington Investment & Manufacturing Corporation (Wellington), the building owner, filed a complaint for injunction (Civil Case No. 64831) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, alleging that the picketers blocked the passageway, harassing tenants and causing damages [1], [2], [3].

Respondent Judge Cloribel issued an *ex parte* restraining order directing PAFLU to cease picketing the passageway [4], [5]. Subsequently, Emmanuel Galang, a lawyer and tenant in the building, filed a separate suit (Civil Case No. 64909), and Judge Cloribel issued a second identical injunction [6]. PAFLU filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the judge lacked jurisdiction because the case involved a labor dispute under the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. 875), which requires specific procedures and findings not met here. PAFLU also argued the injunctions were invalid because no bond was filed by the plaintiffs [7], [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the case involves a "labor dispute" between the union and the building owner/tenants under the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. 875).
2. W/N the right to picket may be regulated to protect "innocent bystanders" not involved in the labor dispute.
3. W/N the preliminary injunctions were validly issued.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** There is no labor dispute between PAFLU and Wellington or Galang. The strike was directed solely against METBANK. Wellington and Galang are mere "innocent bystanders" with no industrial connection to the dispute other than being the landlord and co-lessee. Thus, the strict requirements of Section 9 of R.A. 875 do not apply, and the applicable law is Rule 58 of the Rules of Court regarding civil injunctions [9], [10].

2. **YES.** While the right to picket is a phase of freedom of speech, it is not absolute. Courts have the power to confine the sphere of communication to the parties to the labor dispute and insulate establishments or persons with no interest in the controversy. The right may be regulated at the instance of "innocent bystanders" if the picket creates the impression of a dispute with them or invades their rights. If the law fails to protect neutrals, it may lead to breaches of peace and subversion of the law [11], [12].

3. **NO.** Although the lower court had jurisdiction to regulate the picket to protect innocent bystanders, the specific injunctions issued are null and void because Respondent Judge failed to require Wellington and Galang to file the necessary bonds. Under Section 4 of Rule 58, the filing of a bond is a mandatory requirement for the issuance of a preliminary injunction. The failure to require such bond constitutes grave abuse of discretion [8].

Petition granted. The preliminary injunctions are annulled, without prejudice to the respondents securing new ones after filing the necessary bonds [13].
