I. CAPTION
CIPRIANO VERASTIGUE, ET AL. v. COURT OF APPEALS, CARMEN VERDAGUER, EMILIO VILLASIN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23973, April 29, 1969, 27 SCRA 1196, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Verastigue, et al. disputed the ownership of Lot No. 5387 against private respondents Verdaguer and Villasin. After failing to appeal the decision adjudicating the lot to respondents within the reglementary period, petitioners filed a special civil action for certiorari and mandamus with the Court of Appeals (CA), claiming the Court of First Instance (CFI) acting as a Cadastral Court lacked jurisdiction. The CA dismissed the petition.

Subsequently, respondents moved for a Writ of Possession on March 27, 1961, which the trial court granted on the same day. Petitioners received a copy of the motion only the following day, March 28, 1961. Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the court heard and eventually denied on September 27, 1961. Only after this denial was the writ of possession actually issued. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the cadastral court lacked jurisdiction to issue the writ and that they were denied due process because the order was granted before they received notice.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance, acting as a Cadastral Court, has jurisdiction to issue a writ of possession.
2. W/N the petitioners were denied procedural due process regarding the issuance of the writ of possession.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of First Instance, sitting as a Cadastral Court, has the power to issue a writ of possession. The Court applied the doctrine in *Abellera v. De Guzman* (85 Phil. 738), which explicitly states that after a hearing, a cadastral court may declare a plaintiff the owner and issue a writ directing the sheriff to put them in possession. The Court noted this doctrine is rooted in the 1928 case *Director of Lands v. Court of First Instance of Tarlac* (51 Phil. 805).

2. **NO.** There is no denial of procedural due process where a defect consisting of an absence of notice of hearing is cured by the aggrieved party having the opportunity to be heard on a motion for reconsideration. Citing *Batangas Laguna Tayabas Bus Co. v. Cadiao*, the Court held that what the law prohibits is not the absence of previous notice, but the absolute absence thereof and lack of opportunity to be heard. Since petitioners were able to file a Motion for Reconsideration which was heard and denied before the writ was actually issued, the requirements of due process were met.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
