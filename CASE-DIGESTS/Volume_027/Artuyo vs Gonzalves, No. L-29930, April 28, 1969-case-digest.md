I. CAPTION
BENITO ARTUYO v. FRANCISCO GONZALVES, ET AL. and AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL UNDERWRITERS OF THE PHILIPPINES, INC., G.R. No. L-29930, April 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 1148, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Benito Artuyo filed a claim for overtime compensation and other benefits against defendants Francisco Gonzalves and American International Underwriters of the Philippines, Inc. (AIUPI) for services rendered from January 1950 to August 9, 1956. He originally filed the claim with the Regional Office of the Department of Labor on September 5, 1956 [1]. After years of administrative proceedings and appeals—including a dismissal by the Court of First Instance (CFI) on November 29, 1963, for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to the *Corominas* doctrine—Artuyo filed the present action (Civil Case No. 56254) in the CFI on February 15, 1964 [2].

Defendants moved to dismiss on the grounds of lack of cause of action against Gonzalves and prescription against the Company. The trial court initially denied the motion on April 15, 1964. However, upon a motion for reconsideration filed by defendants on August 12, 1965, the trial court granted the motion and dismissed the case on September 25, 1965 [2]. Artuyo appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court's order dated April 15, 1964, denying the motion to dismiss, had become final and executory.
2. W/N the complaint states a cause of action against defendant Gonzalves.
3. W/N the action against the Company is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The order denying the defendants' motion to dismiss (and motion for reconsideration) is interlocutory in nature [3]. Being interlocutory, it is not appealable independently of the decision on the merits. Since a decision on the merits had not yet been rendered, the order could not have become final and executory [3].

2. **YES.** While the complaint alleges Gonzalves acted as an agent, his own answer admits that Artuyo was engaged in a "personal capacity" at times, yet drove for other company officials and received company benefits like bonuses and group insurance [4]. These circumstances indicate a peculiar employment status, making it "not indubitable" that Artuyo lacks a cause of action against Gonzalves [5]. The lower court should have denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice to passing upon the issue in the decision on the merits, pursuant to Rule 16, Section 3 of the Rules of Court [6].

3. **NO.** The action is not barred. First, the filing of the claim with the Regional Office interrupted the running of the prescriptive period under Republic Act No. 1993, even though said office was subsequently declared without jurisdiction [6]. Deducting the time proceedings were pending in the Regional Office and the courts, the three-year period had not expired when the present case was commenced [7]. Furthermore, Section 7-A of Commonwealth Act No. 444, as amended by RA 1993, explicitly provides that actions commenced before its effectivity (June 22, 1957) shall not be affected by the three-year limitation period. Since Artuyo's claim was pending since September 5, 1956, it falls within this proviso [8].

The appealed order of dismissal is **REVERSED** and the record remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Fernando, Teehankee, and Barredo concurred. Justices Castro and Capistrano did not take part [9].
