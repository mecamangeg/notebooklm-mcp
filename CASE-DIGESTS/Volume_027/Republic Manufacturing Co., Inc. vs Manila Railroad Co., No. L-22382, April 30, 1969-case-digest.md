**I. CAPTION**
REPUBLIC MANUFACTURING CO., INC. v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-22382, April 30, 1969, 27 SCRA 123, Fernando, J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiff Republic Manufacturing Co., Inc. sought to recover the value of lost goods from defendant Manila Railroad Company, the operator of the Manila Port Service. The defendant could only deliver three out of four bales of rayon and cotton remnants to the plaintiff [1]. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila ordered the defendant to pay P3,770.84, refusing to apply the P500.00 limited liability clause contained in Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract between the Manila Port Service and the Bureau of Customs [1, 2]. The CFI reasoned that the defendant failed to plead this limited liability defense in the lower Municipal Court, though the contract was part of the documentary evidence there [2]. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that it was not bound by the Management Contract as it was not a signatory to the agreement [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the consignee is bound by the limited liability clause in the arrastre management contract despite not being a signatory thereto.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the stipulation in the Management Contract is controlling [3]. A consignee who takes delivery of a shipment by virtue of a delivery permit, which incorporates the provisions of the Management Contract by reference—specifically Paragraph 15 limiting liability to P500.00 per package—becomes bound by said provisions [4, 5].

Citing *Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company v. Manila Port Service*, the Court explained that the consignee steps into the shoes of the importer and becomes bound by the stipulations upon using the delivery permit [5]. The consignee could have avoided the P500.00 limit by specifying the true value of the goods, which it failed to do [5].

The decision of the lower court is **MODIFIED**, limiting the liability of defendant Manila Railroad Company to P500.00 [6].
