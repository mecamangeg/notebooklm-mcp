I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ENRIQUITO TAPITAN and ELENO TAPITAN, G.R. No. L-21492, April 25, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On the morning of April 9, 1958, in Goliptoc, Dumingag, Zamboanga del Sur, Maximo Candia and Cleto Baranda went to a disputed piece of land to erect a house. They were met by appellant Eleno Tapitan, who claimed the land was his. Eleno, armed with a revolver and a bolo, threatened them. Despite Candia’s plea to discuss the matter, Eleno ordered, "Come on, you shoot." Immediately, his son, appellant Enriquito Tapitan, fired a home-made shotgun (*paliuntod*) from behind a banana grove. Eleno also fired his revolver. Candia, who was unarmed and had raised his hands to surrender before turning to run, was hit in the back and abdomen, causing his death.

The appellants raised the defense of alibi, claiming they were at a vulcanizing shop in Ozamis City at the time of the incident. The Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Sur convicted them of Murder qualified by evident premeditation and treachery, sentencing them to death.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellants’ defense of alibi can prevail over positive identification.
2. W/N there was conspiracy between the appellants.
3. W/N the crime committed was Murder.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the appellants' weak defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification made by the eyewitnesses (Baranda, Subano, and Asequia), who had no sufficient reason to falsely impute the crime to them. Alibi is one of the weakest defenses and is easily fabricated; it is futile when established against positive testimony placing the accused at the scene of the crime (citing *People v. Caisip* and *United States v. Roque*).

2. **YES.** Conspiracy was inferred from the joint acts of the appellants. Eleno gave the order to shoot, and Enriquito immediately fired, followed by Eleno. The Court applied the principle that when two or more persons unite to accomplish a criminal object, "the act of one is the act of all." Proof of previous concert of criminal design is sufficient to establish conspiracy (*People v. Peralta*; *People v. Magcamit*).

3. **YES.** The conviction for Murder was proper due to the presence of the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation and the aggravating circumstance of treachery. The Court noted that the victim was shot while raising his hands in surrender and attempting to flee, posing no risk to the appellants.

**WHEREFORE**, the judgment is **MODIFIED**. For lack of the necessary number of votes to impose the death penalty, appellants Eleno Tapitan and Enriquito Tapitan are sentenced to suffer *reclusion perpetua* and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P12,000.
