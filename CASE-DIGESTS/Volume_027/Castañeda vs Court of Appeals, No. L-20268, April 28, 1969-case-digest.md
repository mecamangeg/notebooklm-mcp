I. CAPTION
VENANCIO CASTAÑEDA and THE FIRST NATIONAL SURETY AND ASSURANCE COMPANY, INC. v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and CANDIDO R. DIZON, G.R. No. L-20268, April 28, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Candido Dizon filed an action against Petitioner Venancio Castañeda and his surety for the recovery of rentals on a tractor lease [1]. The Court of Appeals (CA) rendered a decision affirming the trial court's judgment but committed a clerical error: the dispositive portion awarded P13,720.37, which was P2,000.00 more than the amount calculated in the body of the decision [2], [3]. Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration and clarification in the CA. Respondent Dizon initially concurred that the excess was a clerical error that could be corrected [4], [5]. However, the CA denied the motion.

Before the Supreme Court, Respondent Dizon opposed the correction, arguing that the CA decision had become final because Petitioners' motion for reconsideration was filed late [3]. Petitioners received the CA decision on April 16, 1962, making the deadline May 1. Since May 1 and 2 were holidays, Petitioners requested and were granted two extensions, eventually filing on May 21 [6]. Respondent contended that the 15-day period to file a motion for reconsideration under Rule 54 (now Rule 52) is non-extendible [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 15-day period for filing a motion for reconsideration in the Court of Appeals is extendible.
2. W/N the clerical error regarding the amount awarded in the CA decision should be corrected.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that there is nothing in the Rules that renders the 15-day period absolutely non-extendible [8], [9]. The Court has control over its processes and, in its discretion, may grant such extensions if seasonably sought [9]. Procedural rules fixing periods are not so rigid as to preclude extensions unless expressly provided otherwise [9].

2. **YES.** The Court found an inconsistency between the body and the dispositive portion of the CA decision [3]. Since Respondent Dizon previously admitted the error was clerical and correctable, he could not later oppose it to his advantage [6]. The Supreme Court modified the judgment to reflect the correct amount based on the CA's own factual findings [10].

**The judgment of the Court of Appeals is modified, reducing the specific award from P13,720.37 to P11,720.37. Double costs against Respondent.**
