I. CAPTION
ANTONIO FAVIS and CORAZON FAVIS v. MUNICIPALITY OF SABAÑGAN, BONTOC, MOUNTAIN PROVINCE, G.R. No. L-26522, February 27, 1969, Teehankee, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Antonio and Corazon Favis (doing business as "Union Grocery & Hardware") filed a collection suit in the City Court of Baguio against the Municipality of Sabañgan for P1,115.00 representing G.I. pipes delivered for a municipal waterworks project [1]-[2]. The City Court ruled in favor of Favis. The Municipality appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Baguio but failed to pay the docket fee or file an appeal bond [3]. Favis moved to dismiss the appeal for non-perfection. The CFI denied the motion, ruling that the Municipality is exempt from legal fees under Rule 141, Section 16 of the Rules of Court [4]. On the merits, the CFI dismissed Favis' complaint, finding the contract invalid due to lack of public bidding and authority [5], [6]. Favis appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a municipality is exempt from paying legal fees under Rule 141, Section 16.
2. W/N the failure to pay docket fees automatically deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction.
3. W/N the Municipality is liable for the contract despite non-compliance with legal requisites.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The exemption clause in Rule 141, Section 16 (formerly Rule 130) applies only to the "Republic of the Philippines," which refers to the National Government, and not to local governments or subdivisions [7]. The Revised Administrative Code distinguishes the "National Government" from "municipalities" [7]. Consequently, the Municipality of Sabañgan is not exempt from paying legal fees.

2. **NO.** In appealed cases, the failure to pay docketing fees does not automatically result in the dismissal of the appeal, much less affect the court's jurisdiction [8]. Dismissal is discretionary for the appellate court [8]. Therefore, the CFI did not commit a fatal error of jurisdiction by taking cognizance of the appeal despite the non-payment [9].

3. **NO.** The contract for the pipes did not comply with Section 3 of R.A. No. 2264, which requires public bidding for municipal purchases [6]. The doctrine of estoppel cannot be applied against a municipal corporation to validate a contract it has no power to make or which violates public policy [10]. To allow estoppel would enable the municipality to do indirectly what it cannot do directly [10].

Decision **AFFIRMED** with modification that the defendant-appellee must pay the legal fees due [11].
