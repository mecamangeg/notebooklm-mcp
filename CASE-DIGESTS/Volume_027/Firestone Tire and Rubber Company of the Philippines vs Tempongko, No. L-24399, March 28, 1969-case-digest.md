I. CAPTION
FIRESTONE TIRE AND RUBBER COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FERNANDO TEMPONGKO, G.R. No. L-24399, March 28, 1969, Teehankee, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Firestone Tire and Rubber Company filed a collection action against defendant Fernando Tempongko in the City Court of Manila [1]. Tempongko, in turn, filed a third-party complaint against Antonio Luna [1]. The City Court rendered judgment in favor of Firestone on the main complaint, ordering Tempongko to pay P1,992.40 plus interest and fees [1]. Simultaneously, it ruled in favor of Tempongko on the third-party complaint, ordering Luna to reimburse Tempongko whatever amount the latter paid to Firestone [2].

Only the third-party defendant, Luna, appealed the decision to the Court of First Instance (CFI) [2]. Tempongko did not appeal the judgment rendered against him in the principal complaint [3]. Consequently, the CFI granted Firestone's motion to execute the judgment against Tempongko, ruling that the trial *de novo* would proceed only regarding the third-party complaint between Tempongko and Luna [4]. Tempongko appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that Luna’s appeal should inure to his benefit and vacate the entire judgment of the City Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal of the third-party defendant inures to the benefit of the defendant/third-party plaintiff who failed to appeal the judgment on the principal complaint.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CFI's order of execution [5]. While an appeal from an inferior court (Municipal or City Court) generally operates to vacate the decision and stands the case for trial *de novo*, this rule applies only to the party who took the appeal [6]. As against other parties adversely affected by the decision who did not appeal, the decision is deemed final and executory [6].

The Court explained that a third-party complaint is an independent, separate, and distinct action from the plaintiff's complaint, merely brought into the same case to avoid circuity of action [7]. When a court grants a third-party complaint, it effectively renders two judgments: one on the principal complaint and another on the third-party complaint [7]. Failure of a party to appeal the judgment against him makes it final; an appeal by one party does not inure to the benefit of a non-appealing party [8]. Citing *Singh v. Liberty Insurance Corp.*, the Court held that since Tempongko did not appeal, the judgment on the principal complaint became final and executory, regardless of the appeal taken by the third-party defendant [3], [9].

Petition is DENIED. Order affirmed [5].
