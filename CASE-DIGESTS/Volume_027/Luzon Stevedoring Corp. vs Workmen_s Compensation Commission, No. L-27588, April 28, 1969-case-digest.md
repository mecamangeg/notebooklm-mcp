I. CAPTION
LUZON STEVEDORING CORPORATION v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and ROSARIO VDA. DE ROSANO, G.R. No. L-27588, April 28, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., Actg. C.J.

II. FACTS
Pastor Rosano, a stevedore who had worked for petitioner Luzon Stevedoring Corporation for 15 years, went to Pier 9 on November 30, 1964, to await a barge. While there, he had a heated argument with Benjamin Valdez, another stevedore, over the possession of a platform used for loading cargo. The barge did not arrive, and the men left. Later that afternoon, when Rosano alighted from a jeep near his home in Tondo (away from the pier), Valdez stabbed and killed him.

Rosano's widow filed a claim for death compensation. Petitioner denied liability, arguing that: (1) there was no employer-employee relationship because Rosano was a casual worker furnished by a Union; (2) the death occurred outside company premises and was not work-related; and (3) the claim was barred by prescription having been filed beyond the three-month period. The Acting Referee ruled in favor of the claimants, which the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed, ruling that the death was compensable and the petitioner failed to controvert the claim on time.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N an employer-employee relationship existed between the petitioner and the deceased.
2. W/N the death is compensable despite occurring outside company premises.
3. W/N the claim is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** An employer-employee relationship existed. The Court found that Rosano had been performing stevedoring work for the petitioner for 15 years. Even assuming the Union furnished the laborers, the Union was merely an agent of the company and not an independent contractor. In such "indirect employment," the employer is not relieved of liability under the Workmen’s Compensation Law [1].

2. **YES.** The death is compensable. The Court held that the fatal stabbing was directly traceable to the disagreement over the work platform, a cause set in motion by the nature of the employment. Citing *Field v. Charmette Knitted Fabric Co.*, the Court ruled that the "quarrel from origin to ending must be taken to be one," regardless of the time and place of the assault, provided it remained an inherent part of the employment incident [2], [3]. Protection "in the course of" employment continues regardless of the place of injury if the workman is acting within the scope of employment [4].

3. **NO.** The defense of prescription does not lie. Although the claim was filed after the three-month period provided in Section 24 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, the petitioner failed to controvert the claimant's right to compensation within the period prescribed by Section 45 of Act 3428 [5]. Failure to controvert constitutes a waiver of non-jurisdictional defenses, including prescription. Furthermore, the Court found the petitioner had actual "knowledge of the accident," which substitutes for formal notice, as the killing was common knowledge among the employees [6].

Petition dismissed.
