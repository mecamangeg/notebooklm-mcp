**I. CAPTION**
REGINO B. ARO v. THE HON. ARSENIO NAÑAWA, LUIS MAGTIBAY, PABLO MAGTIBAY, AURELIA MARTINEZ, GREGORIO LONTOK, MARIA MENDOZA, MAXIMO PORTO and ROSARIO ANDAYA, G.R. No. L-24163, April 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 1090, Barredo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Atty. Aro was engaged by respondents Luis and Pablo Magtibay to prosecute their claim for a share in the estate of their deceased uncle against respondent Aurelia Martinez (the widow). They agreed on a contingent fee of one-third of the recovery. Aro filed the complaint as Civil Case No. SC-525, attaching the legal services contract, and successfully opposed the defendants' motion to dismiss.

Subsequently, the Magtibays and Martinez entered into an extrajudicial partition and compromise agreement without Aro's knowledge. In the agreement, Martinez acknowledged the Magtibays' 1/4 share in the estate, but the Magtibays waived this share in favor of Martinez. The clients then sought the dismissal of the case. Aro opposed the dismissal and filed a counter-motion to record his attorney's lien and fix his compensation. Respondent Judge Nañawa dismissed the case "without prejudice" to Aro filing a separate action for his fees, ruling that the claim should be litigated separately. Aro filed a petition for certiorari, alleging grave abuse of discretion.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the trial court gravely abused its discretion in dismissing the case and refusing to enforce the lawyer's contingent fees in the same proceeding despite the fraudulent compromise.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal orders insofar as they prejudiced the petitioner.

While a client has an undoubted right to compromise a suit without the lawyer's intervention, this right is not absolute. The Court held that when a compromise is entered into in fraud of the lawyer, with the intent to deprive him of fees justly due, the compromise must be subject to said fees. This is especially true when the fraud is committed in confabulation with the adverse party who had knowledge of the lawyer's contingent interest. In this case, the adverse party (Martinez) knew of Aro's contract as it was attached to the complaint [1].

The Court distinguished this from *Rustia v. Judge* (44 Phil. 62), where the adverse party was unaware of the fee agreement. Instead, the Court applied *Recto v. Harden* (100 Phil. 440) and Section 26, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, which provides that if a lawyer is dismissed without justifiable cause, he is entitled to full compensation [2], [3]. The compromise here constituted an implied dismissal without cause. To avoid multiplicity of suits and comply with Article 19 of the Civil Code (observance of honesty and good faith), the trial court should have enforced the attorney's fees in the *same proceeding* rather than directing a separate action [4], [5].

**Disposition:** The orders of the respondent court are set aside insofar as they prejudice the payment of petitioner's fees. Petitioner is awarded attorney's fees fixed at P1,000.00 or one-third of the acknowledged share, constituting a lien on the property.
