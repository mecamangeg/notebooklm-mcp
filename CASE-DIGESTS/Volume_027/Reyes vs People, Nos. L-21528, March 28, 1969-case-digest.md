I. CAPTION
ROSAURO REYES v. THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. Nos. L-21528 & L-21529, March 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 686, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rosauro Reyes, a former civilian employee of the Navy Exchange, led a demonstration against Agustin Hallare and Frank Nolan, whom he blamed for his dismissal. The group carried placards with statements like "Agustin, mamatay ka" and trailed Hallare to his residence. At the gate, Reyes repeatedly shouted threats and the phrase "Agustin, putang ina mo."

Reyes was charged with Grave Threats and Grave Oral Defamation in the Municipal Court of Cavite City. After Reyes pleaded not guilty, the prosecution moved to amend the information for Grave Threats by deleting the word "orally." The defense objected, arguing the amendment was substantial and prejudicial after arraignment. The trial court allowed the amendment without requiring a new plea and subsequently convicted Reyes of both crimes. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the amendment of the information deleting the word "orally" after the plea was substantial and prohibited.
2. W/N a second plea was necessary regarding the amended information.
3. W/N the petitioner is liable for Grave Oral Defamation for uttering "putang ina mo" distinct from Grave Threats.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The amendment was merely formal, not substantial. Under Section 13, Rule 110 of the New Rules of Court, amendments as to matters of form may be made after the plea if they do not prejudice the rights of the defendant. The deletion of the word "orally" did not affect the nature or essence of the crime of Grave Threats charged under Article 282 of the Revised Penal Code, as the particular manner in which a threat is made is not a qualifying ingredient of the offense [1].

2. **NO.** Since the amendment was not substantial and did not change the nature of the charge, no second plea was necessary [2].

3. **NO.** The phrase "putang ina mo" is a common expression in the dialect often employed to express anger or displeasure rather than to slander. It is seldom taken in its literal sense as a reflection on the virtue of a mother. In this case, the expletive was viewed as part of the threats to make them more emphatic, not as a separate crime of defamation [3], [4].

The petition is **GRANTED** in part. The decision is **REVERSED** and the petitioner is **ACQUITTED** regarding the charge of Grave Oral Defamation, but the conviction for Grave Threats is **AFFIRMED** [5].
