I. CAPTION
CITY OF BAGUIO, REFORESTATION ADMINISTRATION, FRANCISCO G. JOAQUIN, SR., FRANCISCO G. JOAQUIN, JR., and TERESITA J. BUCHHOLZ v. HON. PIO R. MARCOS, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF BAGUIO, BELONG LUTES, and the HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-26100, February 28, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On April 12, 1912, the Director of Lands instituted cadastral proceedings (Civil Reservation Case No. 1) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Baguio. A decision was rendered on November 13, 1922, declaring the subject land public. On July 25, 1961, respondent Belong Lutes filed a petition to reopen the case under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 931 to register the land in his name, claiming continuous possession.

Private petitioners (the Joaquins) opposed, alleging they were legitimate tree farm lessees of the land. The City of Baguio and the Reforestation Administration also opposed. The CFI dismissed the private petitioners' opposition, ruling they had no personality to intervene. The Court of Appeals affirmed this ruling but held that the reopening petition was valid.

The petitioners elevated the case to the Supreme Court, raising three main points: (1) the reopening was filed outside the 40-year period prescribed by R.A. 931 because the judicial proceedings were *instituted* in 1912 (more than 40 years before the Act's approval in 1953), although the *decision* was rendered in 1922; (2) lack of publication of the reopening petition; and (3) the standing of the lessees to oppose.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N private petitioners (lessees) have the personality to intervene in the reopening proceedings.
2. W/N the petition to reopen must be published to confer jurisdiction.
3. W/N the petition to reopen was filed within the prescriptive period under R.A. 931, considering the conflict between the Act's title ("decisions rendered") and its body ("proceedings instituted").

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** R.A. 931 expressly allows reopening only for lands that have not been "alienated, reserved, leased, granted, or otherwise... disposed of by the Government." [1] The law impliedly recognizes the rights of lessees; if the land is proven to be leased, the petition to reopen cannot prosper [2]. Therefore, lessees have a sufficient legal interest under the Rules of Court to intervene because the success of their opposition would ensure the continuance of their lease [3], [4].

2. **NO.** The subject matter of the petition for reopening was already embraced in the original cadastral proceedings instituted by the Director of Lands. Consequently, the cadastral court had already acquired jurisdiction over the property. The power of the court to reopen the case is not jurisdictionally tainted by a want of new publication [5], [6].

3. **YES.** While Section 1 of R.A. 931 refers to "judicial proceedings *instituted* within the forty years," the Title of the Act refers to "judicial *decisions rendered* within the forty years." [7] The Court held that the title may be resorted to as an index of legislative intent when the body contains an obscurity or literal rendering defeats the intent [8]. The title, written in capital letters by Congress, is clear and positive [9]. The phrase "by virtue of judicial decisions rendered" was inadvertently omitted from the body. Construing the remedial statute liberally to effect its beneficent purpose, the Court ruled that the 40-year period counts from the date of the decision (1922), not the institution of proceedings (1912). Thus, the 1961 petition was timely filed [10].

**Petition granted. The cadastral court's orders are declared null and void, and it is directed to admit petitioners' oppositions and proceed accordingly.**
