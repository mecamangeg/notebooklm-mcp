**I. CAPTION**
**JESUS W. LAZATIN v. HON. RUPERTO KAPUNAN and LUIS PEÑA**, G.R. No. L-29894, March 28, 1969, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Jesus Lazatin was charged with estafa for allegedly misappropriating a P10,000 check entrusted to him by Vicenta Joven Iturralde. The information alleged he was to deposit the check to demonstrate financial capacity for his wife's travel or return it upon demand [1]. During the trial, after the prosecution rested and the defense had begun presenting evidence, the defense counsel verbally moved for a continuance on September 5, 1968, which respondent Judge Ruperto Kapunan denied, considering the case submitted for decision [2, 3]. Lazatin’s subsequent motion to adduce additional evidence (testimony of his wife and documents proving the transaction was a loan) was also denied [2].

Lazatin filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Supreme Court, which was initially dismissed [4]. However, in his Motion for Reconsideration, Lazatin attached letters from the complainant to his wife demanding "interest" and the return of "capital," suggesting the transaction was a loan and not a trust [5-7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the trial court should be directed to reopen the case to allow the accused to present additional evidence despite the case having been submitted for decision.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** Although the trial court technically acted within its discretion in denying the postponements due to the *pro forma* nature of the motions filed below [8, 9], the Supreme Court held that procedural requirements must yield to the ends of justice when the evidence sought to be presented could determine the difference between acquittal and conviction [10].

The letters attached to the Motion for Reconsideration before the Supreme Court strongly indicated the transaction was a loan, which does not constitute estafa [11]. The Court emphasized the constitutional precept that the accused is presumed innocent and has the right to be heard [10]. Exercising its superintending control over inferior courts, the Supreme Court ruled that where rigid application of procedure results in a substantial wrong, the writ of certiorari may be granted to do substantial justice [12].

**Disposition:** The Court of First Instance of Manila is directed to reopen Criminal Case No. 86565 to enable the defendant to present the letters and any further evidence, and to decide the case upon submission thereof [13].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Castro, Fernando, Capistrano, Teehankee, and Barredo, JJ., concurred) [14].
