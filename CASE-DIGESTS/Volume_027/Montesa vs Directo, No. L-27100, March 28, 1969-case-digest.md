**I. CAPTION**
GERMAN S. MONTESA v. FELIPE ONOFRE DIRECTO, ARTURO ANTONIO DIRECTO, MARIA CARIDAD DIRECTO and VALERIANO MANIPOL, G.R. No. L-27100, March 28, 1969.

**II. FACTS**
On January 24, 1966, the respondents (Directos) filed Civil Case No. 64032 against petitioner German S. Montesa for the partition of a lot in Manila [1]. Their claim was anchored on a deed of extrajudicial partition of the estate of the deceased Angustia Sipin de Montesa [2]. In his answer to that first case, Montesa claimed sole ownership of the property and alleged that the deed of extrajudicial partition was null and void *ab initio* due to mistake and lack of consideration [3].

Seven months later, on September 10, 1966, Montesa instituted the present action (Civil Case No. 66772) against the Directos and Valeriano Manipol to annul the same deed of extrajudicial partition, alleging fraud, deceit, and undue influence [3]. The Directos moved to dismiss this second complaint on the ground of pendency of another action (*litis pendentia*) between the same parties over the same cause [3]. The lower court granted the motion and dismissed the case. Montesa appealed, arguing that the two cases did not share the same subject matter or cause of action because the first was for partition of a specific lot, while the second was for the annulment of the deed covering the entire estate [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the second action for annulment of the deed should be dismissed due to the pendency of the first action for partition.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal [5].

The Court held that the petitioner's claim that the cases involve different subject matters and causes of action is devoid of merit [4]. The respondents' claim in the first case (partition) is necessarily anchored on the adjudication made in their favor in the deed of extrajudicial partition [4]. Since Montesa assailed the validity of this deed in his answer to the first case, the court in that first case must necessarily pass upon the validity or nullity of the deed to resolve the claim for partition [4]. This is the very same issue raised by Montesa in the present complaint for annulment [6].

Thus, the decision in the first case (Civil Case No. 64032) would settle the issue in the case at bar, justifying the dismissal of the second action [2, 6].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Fernando, Capistrano, Teehankee, and Barredo concurred with the ruling [5].
