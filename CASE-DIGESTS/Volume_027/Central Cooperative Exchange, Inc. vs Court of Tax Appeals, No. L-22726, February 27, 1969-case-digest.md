I. CAPTION
CENTRAL COOPERATIVE EXCHANGE, INC. v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF TAX APPEALS and THE HONORABLE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-22726, February 27, 1969, Makalintal, J. [1], [2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Central Cooperative Exchange, Inc. (CCE), a federated cooperative organized under Act No. 3425, filed claims for the refund of compensating and advance sales taxes paid on importations of seedlings and ramie textiles between 1955 and 1958 [3], [4]. CCE invoked Section 48 of Act No. 3425, which exempts cooperatives from percentage taxes [3]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) denied the refund of P762,872.62 on the ground that the taxes were actually paid by the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration (ACCFA) on its own importations, and ACCFA did not enjoy such tax exemption [3], [5]. CCE argued it was the true importer because it paid the costs and incidental expenses, even though the receipts were in ACCFA's name [6]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) denied the petition, ruling that ACCFA was the importer based on the documents and applicable laws restricting such importations to ACCFA [7], [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N CCE was the importer of the goods and entitled to the tax refund under Act No. 3425. [7]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the CTA [9]. The Court ruled that ACCFA was the importer because the import licenses, letters of credit, shipping documents (bills of lading and invoices), and tax receipts were all issued in ACCFA's name [10], [11]. Additionally, under Department of Agriculture regulations and Republic Act No. 1392 (as implemented by Executive Order No. 129), only ACCFA was legally authorized to import the seedlings and ramie textiles in question [10].

The Court held that the payment of costs and expenses by CCE did not make it the importer; rather, it indicated that CCE merely paid in advance for articles purchased *from* ACCFA [12], [13]. Unlike in the case of *Tan Tiong Bio v. CIR*, there was no evidence here that ACCFA acted as a mere agent; ACCFA was the consignee and owner of the goods while they were in customs custody [13], [14]. Consequently, the tax exemption granted to CCE could not apply to these importations [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Fernando, Capistrano, Teehankee, and Barredo concurred with the decision [9].
