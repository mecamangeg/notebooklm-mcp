I. CAPTION
VICENTE ALDABA, ET AL. v. COURT OF APPEALS, CESAR ALDABA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21676, February 28, 1969, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Dr. Vicente Aldaba and his daughter, Dr. Jane Aldaba, rendered services to Belen Aldaba, a wealthy childless widow, for over ten years. Dr. Vicente acted as an adviser, while Jane served as her personal physician until Belen's death in 1955 [1, 2]. Following the liberation of Manila in 1945, Belen invited them to live in her houses situated on two lots in Santa Mesa, Manila [2]. After Belen died, her presumptive heirs, Estanislao Bautista and Cesar Aldaba, executed an extrajudicial partition where the subject lots were allotted to Cesar. Cesar subsequently exchanged these lots with respondent Emmanuel Bautista, who secured new titles and filed an ejectment case against the petitioners [3, 4].

Petitioners filed a complaint in the CFI of Manila to declare themselves owners, claiming Belen had donated the lots to them in consideration of their services (onerous donation). They relied on a handwritten note (Exhibit 6) by Belen stating: "Huag kayong umalis diyan. Talagang iyan ay para sa inyo" (Do not leave there. That is really for you) [5]. They argued that as an onerous donation, it was governed by Article 733 of the Civil Code and did not require a public instrument [6]. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that it was a simple donation *inter vivos* requiring a public instrument under Article 749 [7]. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding the note was merely an indication of intention and not a conveyance [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the note executed by the deceased constituted a valid onerous donation in favor of the petitioners.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals.

First, the Court held that the note (Exhibit 6) was merely an indication of an *intention* to donate, not a conveyance. The phrase "Talagang iyan ay para sa inyo" indicated that at the time of writing, the property had not yet been disposed of. A mere expression of intention is not a promise, as a promise is an undertaking to carry the intention into effect [10].

Second, the Court ruled that the alleged donation was not *cum causa onerosa* (onerous donation). For a donation to be onerous based on services, the services must constitute a demandable debt. Here, there was no express agreement to pay for the services. There was also no implied contract because petitioner Jane Aldaba admitted she did not expect to be paid [11, 12]. When a person renders services without expecting compensation, or renounces their fees, the services do not create a demandable obligation [13].

Since the conditions for an onerous donation were not met, the transaction was at most a simple donation *inter vivos*. However, it was void for failing to comply with Article 749 of the Civil Code, which requires a public instrument for the validity of donations of immovable property [7, 14].

**Decision affirmed.**
