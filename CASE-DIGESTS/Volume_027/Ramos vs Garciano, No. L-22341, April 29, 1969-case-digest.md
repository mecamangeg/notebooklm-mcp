I. CAPTION
**JOSE RAMOS v. HON. HONORATO GARCIANO, et al.**, G.R. No. L-22341, April 29, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jose Ramos was the defendant in Civil Case No. 367, where he was adjudged liable for a sum of money. The judgment was entered on June 21, 1956 [1]. Several writs of execution were issued within the five-year period but were not implemented due to the plaintiff's failure to pay expenses [2]. Notably, the initial writ issued on August 20, 1958, was suspended upon the trial court's suggestion because of the pendency of Civil Case No. 102, a separate action where Ramos questioned a mortgage on his lands [2, 3]. This suspension was without Ramos' knowledge or consent [3].

On June 29, 1961—five years and eight days after the entry of judgment—a fourth alias writ of execution was issued [4]. The sheriff levied upon and sold seventeen parcels of land belonging to Ramos [4]. Ramos moved to set aside the sale, arguing the writ was void for being issued after the five-year prescriptive period [4]. Respondents countered that the period was interrupted because the properties were in *custodia legis* during Civil Case No. 102 [5]. The lower court denied Ramos' motion [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the five-year period for execution by motion was interrupted by the suspension of the initial writ due to the pendency of another case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The limitation that a judgment be enforced by execution within five years goes to the very jurisdiction of the Court; a writ issued after such period is void [6]. The Court held that the properties were not in *custodia legis* during Civil Case No. 102 because they were never legally seized or attached pursuant to a valid court order in that case [7].

Furthermore, the general rule is that the five-year period is interrupted only when the delay is occasioned by the debtor, is for his benefit, or is the result of an agreement [8]. In this case, the suspension of the initial writ was without the knowledge and consent of the debtor (Ramos) [3]. Moreover, the pendency of Civil Case No. 102 involving certain lands did not preclude the levy of execution upon other properties [3]. Since the delay was not attributable to the debtor, the period was not suspended. The petition was granted, and the execution sale was annulled and set aside [9].
