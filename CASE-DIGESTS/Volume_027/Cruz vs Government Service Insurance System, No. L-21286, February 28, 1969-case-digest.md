I. CAPTION
FILEMON CRUZ v. GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-21286, February 28, 1969, Teehankee, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Filemon Cruz, a clerk expediter at the GSIS, was administratively charged with misconduct and dishonesty and placed under preventive suspension on July 26, 1960 [1]. After a formal hearing by the GSIS Special Board of Inquiry where Cruz appeared and was represented by counsel, he was found guilty of dishonesty and acts prejudicial to the service [2, 3]. On March 15, 1961, the GSIS Board of Trustees resolved to consider him "resigned" with prejudice to reinstatement, effective as of the date of his suspension [4].

Meanwhile, separate criminal cases for estafa filed against Cruz in Manila and Bulacan were dismissed in 1962 and 1963, respectively [5, 6]. Relying on these dismissals, Cruz requested reinstatement. When GSIS refused, citing his prior administrative separation, Cruz filed a petition for mandamus before the Supreme Court [7]. In his petition, Cruz and his counsel suppressed the fact of the completed administrative investigation, falsely claiming he had been under "continuous suspension" without an opportunity to defend himself [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is entitled to reinstatement via a writ of mandamus.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner was not unlawfully excluded from his office but was, in fact, legally separated for cause effective July 26, 1960, after due hearing [9]. The Court rejected the argument that the penalty of being "considered resigned" was ineffectual, holding that it is a form of imposing dismissal or separation from the service [10]. Consequently, the respondent GSIS owed the petitioner no duty of reinstatement enforceable by mandamus [9].

Furthermore, the Court severely admonished the petitioner and his counsel for their lack of candor. They suppressed the fact that an administrative hearing had occurred to give the petition a "delusive semblance of plausibility" [9]. Citing *Batangas-Laguna-Tayabas Bus Co. v. Cadiao*, the Court emphasized that members of the Bar are remiss in their duties if they fail to ensure their pleadings reflect facts with truth and accuracy [11].

The petition was **DISMISSED**, with treble costs assessed against the petitioner and his counsel [12].
