I. CAPTION
VARGAS PLOW FACTORY, INC. v. THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-25732, February 27, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Vargas Plow Factory, Inc. (Vargas) applied for free market letters of credit with the Philippine National Bank (PNB) to import materials from Germany. To cover these, PNB executed Forward Exchange Contracts with the Central Bank (CB) on December 15, 1961, December 26, 1961, and January 19, 1962. At that time, CB Circular No. 122 imposed a 15% margin fee on sales of foreign exchange. However, on January 21, 1962, CB Circular No. 133 suspended this margin fee. The drafts drawn by the foreign beneficiary against the letters of credit were accepted by Vargas between January 30, 1962, and December 6, 1962, after the fee suspension. The CB collected P11,642.65 as margin fee, which Vargas paid under protest. Vargas filed a suit for refund in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI ruled in favor of Vargas, relying on the *Belman* doctrine that a sale of foreign exchange is not consummated until payment/delivery, meaning the relevant dates were the draft acceptances during the suspension period. The Central Bank appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the margin fee was validly collected on foreign exchange sold through forward exchange contracts executed before the fee's suspension, even if the drafts were accepted after the suspension.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. Relying on the doctrine established in *Pacific Oxygen & Acetylene Co. v. Central Bank*, the Court held that Republic Act No. 2609 and relevant circulars make no distinction between perfected and consummated sales [1]. Under the Civil Code (Arts. 1315, 1475), a sale is perfected by mutual consent, even if the subject matter has not been delivered [1]. The true sale of foreign exchange occurred when the forward exchange contracts were executed in December 1961 and January 1962, while the margin levy was still in force [2]. The subsequent opening of letters of credit and acceptance of drafts merely constituted a *stipulation pour autrui* (stipulation in favor of a third party) to deliver the dollars previously sold to the importer [2]. Consequently, the margin fee was properly collected.

The decision of the Court of First Instance is REVERSED, and the complaint is DISMISSED.
