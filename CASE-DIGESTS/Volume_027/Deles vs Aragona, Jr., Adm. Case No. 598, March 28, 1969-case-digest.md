I. CAPTION
AURORA SORIANO DELES v. VICENTE E. ARAGONA, JR., Adm. Case No. 598, March 28, 1969, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Aurora Soriano Deles filed a disbarment complaint against respondent Atty. Vicente E. Aragona, Jr. for allegedly making false and malicious allegations in an "Urgent Motion to Declare Respondent in Contempt of Court" filed in Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) Cases 1254 and 1255. Aragona, acting as counsel for the tenants (Aglinao brothers), filed the motion after receiving reports that Deles' men, described as "armed goons," had harvested palay on the disputed land in violation of a subsisting interlocutory order [1-3]. Deles denied ordering the harvest and claimed the allegations caused her mental torture [4, 5]. Previously, Deles filed a criminal complaint for libel regarding the same motion, which the City Fiscal dismissed on the ground that the allegations were privileged communications [6]. The Solicitor General investigated the present administrative case and recommended its dismissal [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Atty. Aragona should be disciplined or disbarred for the allegations made in the motion for contempt.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the complaint. The Court held that statements made in the course of judicial proceedings are absolutely privileged—regardless of defamatory tenor or the presence of malice—if they are relevant, pertinent, or material to the cause in hand or subject of inquiry (*People v. Aquino*) [8]. The allegations in Aragona's motion were made in the course of the CAR cases and were relevant to the issue of the alleged violation of the court's order [9].

The privilege is not defeated by factual or legal inaccuracies, nor by intemperate language, provided there is probable cause for belief in their truthfulness and the charge is made in good faith (*Sison v. David*; *U.S. v. Bustos*) [10]. The Court found that Aragona acted in good faith and with probable cause, having relied on first-hand reports from his clients and witnesses regarding the unauthorized harvest [11, 12]. Lawyers must be allowed great latitude of pertinent comment in the furtherance of the causes they uphold (*Dorado v. Pilar*) [13].

ACCORDINGLY, the administrative complaint against the respondent is hereby dismissed [14].
