I. CAPTION
RUFINO BUENO, et al. v. MATEO H. REYES and JUAN H. REYES, G.R. No. L-22587, April 28, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On January 7, 1936, Francisco H. Reyes filed an answer in a cadastral case regarding Lot No. 2357 of the Laoag Cadastre, claiming it for himself and his brothers, respondents Juan and Mateo Reyes. The lot was adjudicated to them, and Original Certificate of Title No. 19074 was issued in their names on July 7, 1939.

Twenty-three years later, on December 12, 1962, petitioners (heirs of Jorge Bueno) filed an action for reconveyance. They alleged that the lot originally belonged to Jorge Bueno and that Francisco H. Reyes (husband of one of the heirs) was entrusted by agreement to file the cadastral answer for all the heirs. Instead, Francisco allegedly acted in bad faith or mistake by registering it in his and his brothers' names. Petitioners claimed they had been in continuous possession of the land and only discovered the fraud in 1962 when the respondents appeared and attempted to take possession. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription, ruling that the action was based on an implied trust which prescribes in 10 years from registration.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for reconveyance based on an implied trust has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that while an action for reconveyance based on an implied or constructive trust prescribes in ten years, the prescriptive period in this case should not be counted from the date of registration.

Under Article 1456 of the Civil Code, if property is acquired through mistake or fraud, the person obtaining it is considered a trustee of an implied trust for the benefit of the real owner. While registration generally serves as constructive notice to the world, it could not be invoked by the respondents in this case because Francisco Reyes was explicitly entrusted by the petitioners to file the application for them. His breach of that authority cannot serve as constructive notice. Furthermore, the petitioners were in continuous possession of the property and the fraud was only discovered in 1962 when respondents attempted to take possession. Consequently, the cause of action accrued only upon the actual discovery of the bad faith or mistake in 1962. Since the complaint was filed that same year, the action has not prescribed.

The Order appealed from is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
