I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JUDGE JUAN L. BOCAR and JOSE SIMBORIO Y SALONGA, G.R. No. L-27120, March 28, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Jose Simborio y Salonga was charged with murder for the shooting of Avelino Concepcion, Jr. [1]. Simborio filed a motion for bail, arguing that the evidence of his guilt was not strong [2]. At the bail hearing, the prosecution presented exhibits including the victim's *ante mortem* statement placing Simborio at the scene, and an eyewitness account stating Simborio held the victim's arm while another shot him [2]. The defense countered with an alibi that Simborio was taking an exam at the Mapua Institute of Technology at the time of the crime, supported by his examination paper and instructor testimonies [2]. Although the prosecution initially manifested an intent to call witnesses to amplify the exhibits, the fiscal effectively withdrew this by offering to submit the matter for resolution on the evidence already presented, provided the defense admitted the exhibits, which the defense did [3]. Respondent Judge Bocar granted bail, ruling that the conflict between the eyewitness accounts and the alibi evidence rendered the evidence of guilt not strong [4, 5]. The prosecution filed a petition for certiorari, alleging grave abuse of discretion and claiming it was deprived of the right to present complete evidence [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial judge committed grave abuse of discretion in granting bail on the ground that the prosecution was deprived of the opportunity to present its evidence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court found no grave abuse of discretion. While due process demands that the prosecution be afforded full opportunity to present proof of guilt in bail hearings (*Angeles v. Abaya*), the record showed that the fiscal voluntarily dispensed with the introduction of additional evidence [3, 6]. The fiscal's agreement to rest the case on the exhibits, which were admitted by the defense, constituted a judicial admission under Section 2, Revised Rule 129 [3]. Having taken the risk of resting its case on the exhibits presented, the prosecution cannot claim it was deprived of its rights when that evidence was found inadequate [3]. Furthermore, the Court noted that the trial judge did not err in finding that the evidence of guilt was not strong, given the contentious issue of the accused's whereabouts created by the contradictory evidence of the eyewitnesses and the school records [7, 8].

Petition dismissed [8].
