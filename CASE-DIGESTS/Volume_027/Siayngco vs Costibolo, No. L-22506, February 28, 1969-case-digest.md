**I. CAPTION**
**ENCARNACION M. SIAYNGCO, assisted by her husband, JULIO SIAYNGCO v. MARTIN COSTIBOLO and THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS**, G.R. No. L-22506, February 28, 1969, Teehankee, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Martin Costibolo filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte to annul a judgment of the Justice of the Peace Court of Dagami on the ground of extrinsic fraud. Costibolo alleged he confessed judgment in the lower court only because petitioners (Siayngco spouses) promised not to execute it for five years—a promise they violated by immediately executing the judgment.

During the trial in the CFI, after Costibolo rested his case, the Siayngco spouses filed a motion to dismiss (demurrer to evidence), expressly reserving their right to present evidence should the motion be denied. The CFI denied the reservation, ruling that a demurrer constitutes a waiver of the right to present evidence. Consequently, the CFI denied the motion to dismiss and simultaneously rendered a decision annulling the Justice of the Peace judgment and awarding damages to Costibolo without hearing the petitioners' evidence. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, holding that a defendant who relies on the insufficiency of the plaintiff's case waives the right to present evidence.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioners waived their right to present evidence by filing a demurrer to evidence which was denied by the trial court.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the trial court erred in denying the petitioners their day in court. Under **Rule 35, Section 1 of the Revised Rules of Court**, a defendant who moves for dismissal on the ground of insufficiency of evidence (demurrer) does *not* waive the right to offer evidence if the motion is **denied** by the trial court. The waiver of the right to present evidence applies only when the demurrer is *granted* by the trial court but the order of dismissal is subsequently *reversed on appeal*.

The Court explained that if the trial court denies the demurrer, the case remains before it, and the defendant must be allowed to present evidence to ensure all facts are placed before the court for proper adjudication. Furthermore, the Court noted that in actions for annulment of judgment based on fraud (analogous to Rule 38), the procedure involves two hearings: (1) to determine if the judgment should be set aside due to fraud, and (2) to hear the case on the merits. Even under the old rule regarding waiver, such waiver would have only applied to the first hearing on fraud, not the second hearing on the merits of the original debt.

**Disposition:** The decision is REVERSED and the case REMANDED to the lower court for further proceedings.
