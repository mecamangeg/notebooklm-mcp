I. CAPTION
**IN RE: PETITION FOR CORRECTION OF ENTRY OF CERTIFICATE OF BIRTH OF THE MINOR, CHUA TAN CHUAN. CHUA TAN CHUAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-25439, March 28, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On April 28, 1965, petitioner Chua Tan Chuan, a Chinese citizen residing in Davao City, filed a petition to correct the birth certificate of his minor son, Jacob Chua [1]. The birth certificate indicated Jacob’s nationality as "Chinese" [1]. Petitioner sought to change this entry to "Filipino," claiming it was a mistake [2]. He alleged that he and the child's mother, Leoncia Manglangit, lived as common-law husband and wife without being legally married, making Jacob an illegitimate child who should follow the mother's citizenship [1, 2].

The Court of First Instance of Davao (Judge Bullecer) granted the petition on September 24, 1965, ordering the correction of the entry [1, 3]. The Republic of the Philippines appealed the decision to the Supreme Court [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for correction of entry in the civil registry is the proper remedy to change a person's citizenship from alien to Filipino.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision [6]. The Court held that the remedy sought cannot be granted in the manner desired [7]. While the action ostensibly seeks a mere correction of an entry in the Civil Registry, it effectively requests a judicial declaration of Philippine citizenship [3, 8].

Citing *Reyes v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-17642), the Court reiterated the settled doctrine that declaratory relief is not available for the purpose of obtaining a judicial declaration of citizenship [3]. This principle was affirmed in subsequent cases such as *Chug Siu v. Local Civil Registrar* and *Dy En Siu Co v. Local Civil Registrar* [3]. Consequently, the lower court's decision allowing an alien national to become a Filipino citizen through a petition for correction of entry was erroneous [5].

The decision of the lower court is reversed, with costs against the petitioner [6].
