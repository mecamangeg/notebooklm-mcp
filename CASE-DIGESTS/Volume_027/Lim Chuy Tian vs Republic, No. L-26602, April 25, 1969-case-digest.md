**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF LIM CHUY TIAN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. LIM CHUY TIAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-26602, April 25, 1969, Castro, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Lim Chuy Tian was granted Philippine citizenship by the Court of First Instance of Manila on October 30, 1961, and took his oath on March 31, 1964 [1]. On March 28, 1968, the Republic filed a motion to cancel his naturalization certificate, alleging it was obtained fraudulently and illegally because, among other grounds, he failed to enroll his school-age children in recognized Philippine schools [2]. Lim argued that the Government was aware of these facts during the initial hearing and should have raised them earlier [3]. The trial court denied the motion to cancel [3]. The records revealed that petitioner's daughter, Lim Lily, resided in China and Hong Kong until 1960 and was not enrolled in Philippine schools during that time [4, 5]. Upon her arrival in the Philippines, she was enrolled in St. Stephen High School, a school where the majority of students were Chinese [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the naturalization certificate should be cancelled due to failure to comply with the education requirement.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that a naturalization certificate is a political privilege subject to cancellation if obtained illegally or fraudulently, and neither estoppel nor *res judicata* bars the Government from seeking its cancellation [7]. Section 2 of the Revised Naturalization Law mandates the enrollment of school-age children in local Filipino schools to ensure their training in the Filipino way of life [5]. The Court held that the inability to bring a child to the Philippines is not a valid excuse for non-compliance with this mandatory requirement [8]. Furthermore, enrolling the child in a Chinese school (St. Stephen High School) negated the petitioner's sincerity in embracing Filipino ideals and traditions [6].

Accordingly, the decision and order of the lower court were **SET ASIDE**, and the naturalization certificate was **CANCELLED and REVOKED** [9].
