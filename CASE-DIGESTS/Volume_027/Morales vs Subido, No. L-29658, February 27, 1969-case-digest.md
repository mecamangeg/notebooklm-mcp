I. CAPTION
ENRIQUE V. MORALES v. ABELARDO SUBIDO, G.R. No. L-29658, February 27, 1969, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Morales filed a Motion for Reconsideration of a Supreme Court decision, contending that Section 10 of the Police Act of 1966, as officially published, did not reflect the version actually approved by Congress [1, 2]. Morales argued that the phrase "who has served the police department of a city or" was inadvertently omitted from the qualifications for Chief of a City Police Agency during the engrossment or proofreading of the bill [3, 4]. To support this, he submitted drafts of House Bill 6951, page proofs, and a memorandum from a Senate employee stating the section was "recast for clarity" [4, 5]. Petitioner urged the Court to look behind the enrolled Act to correct this alleged clerical error and establish the true legislative intent [4, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court may go behind the enrolled Act to inquire into the history of its enactment and correct an alleged error in the text based on legislative drafts or journals.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the **Enrolled Bill Doctrine** is conclusive upon the courts [6, 7]. The respect due to the co-equal branches of government requires the Judiciary to act upon the faith and credit of the enrolled Act as attested to by the presiding officers of Congress and approved by the President [6, 8]. To investigate the legislative process would disregard the **separation of powers** and impair the integrity of law-making [6].

The Court affirmed the rule established in *Mabanag v. Lopez-Vito* and *Casco Philippine Chemical Co. v. Gimenez*: if a mistake occurred in the printing of the bill before certification, the remedy is by **amendment or curative legislation**, not by judicial decree [9, 10]. While the Constitution requires certain matters to be entered into the Journal (which would prevail if omitted), for matters not expressly required to be entered, the **enrolled bill prevails** over the journal or other records in the event of a discrepancy [11, 12].

The Motions for Reconsideration were denied [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Fernando, and Capistrano, JJ., concurred [12].
