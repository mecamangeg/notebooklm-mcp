**I. CAPTION**
LEONCIO YU LIM v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-23591, March 28, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J. [1], [2]

**II. FACTS**
On January 29, 1963, petitioner Leoncio Yu Lim filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Surigao del Norte [2], [3]. He claimed to be single, a general merchant deriving an average annual income of P3,398.03 from "Southern Bazar," and an assistant manager of "Pan Pacific Remnant Industry" with an annual salary of P1,440.00 [3]. He also claimed "Dodong" was merely a nickname [4] and asserted his belief in the principles of the Constitution [5]. The CFI granted the petition, calculating his total income at P6,633.00 by adding a P1,800.00 tax exemption and his alleged salary to his business income [6]. The Republic appealed, arguing insufficient income, unauthorized use of an alias, and lack of evidence regarding belief in the Constitution [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the petitioner’s use of the alias "Dodong" is a ground for denial.
3. W/N the petitioner sufficiently proved his belief in the principles of the Constitution.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The petitioner failed to prove a lucrative income. The Supreme Court ruled that his alleged salary of P1,440.00 from Pan Pacific Remnant Industry could not be considered because it rested solely on his uncorroborated testimony, the partnership was registered only in 1962 without declaring dividends, and the business was in Quezon City while he lived in Surigao [7]. Excluding this unproven salary, his average annual income was only P2,043.59 (approx. P172.00/month), which falls below the lucrative trade requirement [8]. Citing *Dy v. Republic*, *Uy v. Republic*, and *Kock Tee Yap v. Republic*, the Court reiterated that even P300.00 a month is inadequate [8]. Furthermore, the lower court erred in adding the P1,800.00 personal tax exemption to his income, as this amount is a deduction, not additional earning [9].

2. **YES.** The use of the alias was unauthorized and fatal to the application. Official certificates presented as evidence indicated "Dodong" was used as an alias, not a nickname [4]. The petitioner failed to mention this alias in his petition or prove that its use was legally authorized [4].

3. **NO.** "Mere naked statements of belief" in the principles of the Constitution, without specific facts or particulars to support the conclusion, are neither competent nor adequate proof [5]. The burden of proving the truth of the allegations lies with the petitioner [5].

The appealed decision is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DISMISSED** [10].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Concepcion, C.J., Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Fernando, Capistrano, and Teehankee, JJ., concurred [10]. Barredo, J., did not take part [10].
