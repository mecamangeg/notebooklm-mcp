**I. CAPTION**
**NICANOR M. BALTAZAR v. SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC.**, G.R. No. L-23076, February 27, 1969, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiff Nicanor Baltazar was the salesman-in-charge of defendant San Miguel Brewery’s Dagupan warehouse. On October 9, 1956, workers at the warehouse went on strike, alleging unfair treatment by Baltazar. To relieve tension, the company recalled Baltazar to its Manila office [1]. He reported for work in Manila until November 2, 1956, but was not given specific assignments. Starting November 3, 1956, Baltazar absented himself without authority or notice for 48 consecutive days [2]. Consequently, San Miguel dismissed him for cause effective November 30, 1956 [3].

Baltazar filed a complaint, and the Court of First Instance of Manila ruled that his dismissal was justified due to his unauthorized absences. However, the trial court still ordered San Miguel to pay Baltazar one month of separation pay and the cash value of six months of accumulated sick leave [3]. Baltazar did not appeal the finding that his dismissal was justified; San Miguel appealed the award of separation pay and sick leave benefits [4, 5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N an employee dismissed for cause is entitled to separation pay.
2. W/N accumulated sick leave benefits are commutable to cash.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** Under Republic Act No. 1052, an employee not employed for a definite period is not entitled to one-month notice or one-month salary in lieu thereof if the dismissal is for cause [6, 7]. The Court cited *Marcaida vs. Philippine Education Co.*, stating that the law excludes employees separated for causes attributable to their own fault [8]. Since the trial court’s finding that Baltazar was dismissed for cause (unauthorized absence) had become final, the award of separation pay was improper [5, 9].

2. **NO.** The Court held that Baltazar was not entitled to the cash value of his accumulated sick leave. While the company’s Health, Welfare and Retirement Plan allowed unused sick leave to be accumulated up to six months, the rules explicitly stated that such leave is "not commutable or payable in cash" [9]. The import of the rule is that an employee may carry over unused leave to enjoy as time off in subsequent years, but cannot convert it into money [7, 10].

**ACCORDINGLY**, the appealed decision is reversed [10].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Sanchez and Fernando reserved their votes. Justice Capistrano did not take part. [11]
