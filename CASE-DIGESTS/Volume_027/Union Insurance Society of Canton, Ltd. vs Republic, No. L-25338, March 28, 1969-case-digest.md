I. CAPTION
UNION INSURANCE SOCIETY OF CANTON, LTD. v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25338, March 28, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Union Insurance Society of Canton, Ltd., as subrogee of the consignee Sillicons Manufacturing Company, filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Manila to recover P42,370.30 from the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs Arrastre Service [1]. The claim represented the value of 135 coils of copper wire unloaded from the vessel "Eastern Star" on September 27, 1964, which were allegedly lost while in the custody of the Customs Arrastre Service due to negligence [1]. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the Republic is immune from suit without its consent, and that the Bureau of Customs and the Arrastre Service are mere dependencies of the Republic with no separate juridical personality [1]. The lower court granted the motion and dismissed the case [1]. The plaintiff appealed directly to the Supreme Court [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Republic of the Philippines and the Customs Arrastre Service may be sued for the acts of the Customs Arrastre personnel.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal, reiterating the doctrine of the State's immunity from suit [3, 4]. The Court ruled that the Republic cannot be sued without its consent and that the Customs Arrastre Service is merely a branch of the Bureau of Customs performing a governmental function [1, 3]. The Court applied the doctrine settled in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service* (1966) and *Caltex (Phil.) Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service* (1967), which firmly established the Republic's non-suability in arrastre operations [3, 5]. The order of dismissal appealed from is affirmed [4].
