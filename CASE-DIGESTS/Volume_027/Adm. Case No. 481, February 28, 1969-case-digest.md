I. CAPTION
VIRGINIA C. ALMIREZ v. ARTURO P. LOPEZ, Adm. Case No. 481, February 28, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Virginia Almirez and Respondent Arturo P. Lopez, a lawyer admitted to the Bar in 1957, became sweethearts in December 1958. Under a promise of marriage, they engaged in carnal relations from November 1960 to April 1961 in various Manila hotels [1, 2]. When Almirez became pregnant, Lopez gave her pills to "hasten menstruation" and urged her to undergo an abortion, which she refused [2]. They secured a marriage license in March 1961, but the wedding did not take place [3]. Almirez filed a disbarment complaint on April 18, 1961 [3].

During the investigation by the Solicitor General, Lopez induced Almirez to sign a motion withdrawing her complaint and an affidavit exculpating him, again promising marriage [4]. However, instead of marrying Almirez, Lopez married another woman, Evelyn Orense, in January 1963 [4]. The Solicitor General and the Supreme Court's Legal Officer-Investigator found Lopez guilty of the charges, with the latter recommending suspension [5, 6]. Lopez denied the sexual relations and claimed Almirez was pregnant by another man [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent should be disbarred for gross immoral conduct.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court found Respondent guilty of gross immoral conduct rendering him unfit to be a member of the Bar [8].

Respondent's denial of carnal knowledge was unworthy of credence given the evidence of their hotel visits and the admitted applications for a marriage license [9]. The Court held that the breach of promise to marry was patent [10]. Furthermore, Respondent displayed moral turpitude by urging the Complainant to commit abortion [10]. His character was further revealed when, during the pending case, he deceived Complainant into withdrawing her charges and signing a blank affidavit under a false promise of marriage, only to marry another woman shortly after [10].

Citing jurisprudence such as *In re Pelaez* and *Mortel v. Aspiras*, the Court ruled that such conduct warrants removal from the legal profession [8].

**Disposition:** Respondent Arturo P. Lopez is barred from the practice of law and his name stricken from the roll of attorneys [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
