I. CAPTION
CLENIO L. ONDONA v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, MUNICIPAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF CAGWAIT, SURIGAO DEL SUR and ADELFO LUENGAS, G.R. No. L-29199, March 28, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Clenio L. Ondona (Nacionalista Party) and Respondent Adelfo Luengas (Liberal Party) were mayoralty candidates in Cagwait, Surigao del Sur during the November 1967 elections [1]. The Municipal Board of Canvassers proclaimed Luengas as the winner [1]. Ondona filed a petition for the annulment of the canvass and proclamation with the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) and subsequently filed an election protest with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Surigao del Sur [1, 2].

COMELEC dismissed the petition for annulment, prompting Ondona to file a motion for reconsideration [3, 4]. While this motion was pending, the election protest in the CFI came up for hearing. Luengas moved to suspend the CFI proceedings pending the outcome of the COMELEC motion [5]. Ondona opposed the postponement, manifesting to the court that he was "withdrawing" his motion for reconsideration in COMELEC to expedite the protest [5, 6]. The CFI proceeded with the trial and eventually declared Luengas the duly elected mayor [7]. Consequently, COMELEC denied Ondona's motion for reconsideration citing the CFI decision, leading Ondona to appeal to the Supreme Court [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Ondona may still pursue his petition for annulment of proclamation with COMELEC after insisting on the conclusion of his election protest in the Court of First Instance.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the COMELEC resolutions, holding that the petitioner cannot be permitted to proceed with an election protest and, upon losing, fall back on the COMELEC to seek the nullification of the canvass and proclamation [9, 10].

By opposing the suspension of the CFI proceedings and manifesting that he was withdrawing his motion in the COMELEC, Ondona recognized the validity of the proclamation and effectively abandoned his petition for annulment [6, 9]. The Court ruled that it is unfair and inequitable for a party to pursue both remedies simultaneously in this manner; having insisted that the protest proceed to its conclusion, he has no cause for complaint regarding the dismissal of his COMELEC petition [9].

Resolutions affirmed [10].
