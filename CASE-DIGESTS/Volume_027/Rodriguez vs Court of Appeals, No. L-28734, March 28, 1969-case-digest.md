I. CAPTION
EMETERIO A. RODRIGUEZ and JOSE AYALA v. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, PETRA RODRIGUEZ, ANTONIA RODRIGUEZ, and ROSA RODRIGUEZ, G.R. No. L-28734, March 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 546, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Doña Margarita Rodriguez died leaving a will dated September 30, 1951, which was probated without opposition [1]. She had no compulsory or forced heirs [2]. A clause in her will (Clausula Decima) created a trust over certain properties and prohibited their alienation "kailan man" (forever) [3]. The petitioners, executors of the will, secured approval for the trust from the Court of First Instance (CFI) [2]. The respondents, cousins of the deceased, opposed the trust [2]. The Court of Appeals (CA) initially affirmed the CFI's decision but, upon a motion for reconsideration, issued a Resolution declaring the trust a nullity [4]. The CA held that the perpetual prohibition on alienation violated Articles 867 and 870 of the Civil Code, and consequently ordered intestate succession for the properties involved [4, 5]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the testamentary provision prohibiting alienation "forever" renders the entire trust void, resulting in intestacy.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CA's Resolution.

The Court ruled that while Article 870 of the Civil Code declares dispositions prohibiting alienation for more than 20 years as void, this does not invalidate the provision entirely [6]. The prohibition on alienation is valid for the statutory period of 20 years; it is only the prohibition *beyond* that period that is void [6, 7].

The Court emphasized that the wishes of the testator constitute the law (*dicat testor et erit lex*) and must be given effect unless they fail to follow a legal norm [1, 8]. Since the testatrix had no forced heirs, she was free to dispose of her estate to strangers [2, 9]. To declare the trust void and distribute the property via intestacy would violate her clear intent and Article 791, which prefers interpretations that prevent intestacy [8]. The disposition is valid for the first 20 years, after which the prohibition ceases [10].

The Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated January 8, 1968, is SET ASIDE, and its original decision affirming the lower court is reinstated [11].
