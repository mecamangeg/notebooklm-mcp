I. CAPTION
OTILLA SEVILLA, FLORENCIO QUIJANO and LEONOR SEVILLA v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, NICOLAS QUISANOLA and EUSTAQUIA TABIO, G.R. No. L-22012, April 28, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Nicolas Quiñanola and Eustaquia Tabio filed a civil case against petitioners (the Sevillas and Quijanos) to consolidate ownership over two parcels of land under a *pacto de retro* sale. The parties executed a Compromise Agreement on **February 7, 1956**, wherein the respondents granted the petitioners a period of eight (8) months "from date hereof" to repurchase the property. The Court approved this agreement in a judgment rendered on **February 9, 1956**.

On **October 9, 1956**, exactly eight months from the date of the judgment but two days after eight months from the date of the agreement's execution, the petitioners deposited the full repurchase price with the Clerk of Court. Respondents refused to accept the payment, claiming the period had expired. The Court of First Instance (CFI) ruled the redemption valid and ordered reconveyance. However, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the CFI, ruling that the repurchase was late based on the strict text of the agreement (counting from Feb. 7) and ordered the consolidation of ownership in favor of the respondents.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners' repurchase of the property was valid despite being effected two days after the stipulated period in the compromise agreement.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Although the CA was technically correct that the period expired on October 7 (8 months from the agreement date of Feb. 7), the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the petitioners based on **Article 1234 of the New Civil Code**. The Court found that the petitioners acted in **good faith**, operating under the impression that the repurchase period began from the date of the judgment (Feb. 9), not the date of execution. Furthermore, the respondents suffered no prejudice from the two-day delay. Consequently, the Court held that the petitioners substantially performed their obligation in good faith, which must be deemed a "strict and complete fulfillment" of the compromise agreement.

The decision of the Court of Appeals was **REVERSED**, and the order of the CFI confirming the redemption was **RESTORED/AFFIRMED**.
