I. CAPTION
JOSE D. VILLEGAS and RIZALINA SANTOS RIVERA v. ALFREDO FERNANDO, ET AL. and JOSE MIRANDA SAMPEDRO and PEDRO MANAHAN v. DIRECTOR OF LANDS, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-27347 & L-24901, April 28, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., Actg. C.J.

II. FACTS
On October 27, 1959, the heirs of Sampedro and Manahan (Appellants) petitioned the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to approve an amended plan and issue a decree of registration for a parcel of land based on a November 26, 1938 Court of Appeals decision. They submitted a copy of said decision to support their petition. On December 2, 1959, the CFI approved the plan and ordered the issuance of the decree.

Within one year, private respondents (Fernando, et al.) filed petitions for review alleging fraud. During pre-trial, it was discovered that the original records had been destroyed during the war. The copy of the 1938 decision submitted by Appellants was merely a certified copy of a copy from the Land Registration Commission, not from the General Land Registration Office (GLRO). Respondents moved to set aside the December 2, 1959 order, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction because the lost records were not reconstituted under Act No. 3110. The CFI issued an order on August 23, 1963 setting aside its previous order directing the issuance of the decree. Appellants appealed, contending that Act No. 3110 applies only to pending cases, not those already decided pre-war.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the registration proceedings were considered pending and thus required reconstitution under Act No. 3110.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that so long as a decree of registration has not been issued, registration proceedings are "still pending" for the purposes of Act No. 3110. Consequently, when records are lost or destroyed, they must be reconstituted in conformity with said Act.

The Court found that the Appellants failed to comply with the strict notice requirements of Act No. 3110, specifically the publication of notice in the Official Gazette and a newspaper of general circulation. Furthermore, under Section 9 of Act No. 3110, pending proceedings must be reconstituted by means of "fully certified true copies" issued by the Chief of the GLRO. The copy submitted by Appellants did not meet this requirement. The Court cited *Mayol v. Piccio*, ruling that failure to reconstitute destroyed judicial records within the statutory period (which expired June 17, 1963) constitutes a waiver of the effects of the decision, leaving parties to file an action anew.

The Orders of August 23, 1963 and April 11, 1964 were **AFFIRMED**. The appeal regarding the denial of the motion to dismiss was **DISMISSED** for being interlocutory and premature.
