I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. TOMAS LACANDAZO, ET AL., accused; FELIZARDA SANDOVAL, Mother of the offended party and appellant, G.R. No. L-29058, February 28, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Tomas Lacandazo was convicted by the Court of First Instance of Palawan for homicide through simple negligence. He was sentenced to imprisonment and ordered to indemnify the heirs of the deceased, Matilde Sandoval, in the amount of P6,000. Felizarda Sandoval, the mother of the deceased, appealed the decision. Lacandazo filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the appellant lacked the personality to prosecute the case, that the appeal was contrary to the Rules of Court, and that he had already served his sentence and was released from custody.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal filed by the mother of the offended party regarding the civil indemnity should be dismissed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the appeal cannot be dismissed. While the finding of guilt for homicide through simple negligence cannot be the subject of an appeal because it would place the accused in double jeopardy, the victim's mother may appeal only that portion of the decision sentencing the accused to pay civil indemnity. The Court noted that the appellant received the notice of the decision and filed the notice of appeal within the reglementary period, and the trial judge had given due course to the appeal. Therefore, it is presumed that the appellant complied with all legal requirements.

Appellant Felizarda Sandoval was required to file her brief concerning the civil aspect of the case within thirty (30) days from notice.
