I. CAPTION
CHAMBER OF FILIPINO RETAILERS, INC., NATIONAL MARKET VENDORS ASSOCIATION, INC., AMBROSIO ILAO, CRISPIN DE GUZMAN, JOSE J. LAPID, and FELICISIMO LAS v. HON. ANTONIO J. VILLEGAS, as City Mayor of Manila, The CITY TREASURER and The CITY OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-29864, February 28, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners filed Civil Case No. 73902 in the Court of First Instance of Manila challenging the validity of Ordinance No. 6696 (later superseded by Ordinance No. 6767), which increased market stall rental fees [1]. The lower court initially issued a restraining order but lifted it on November 3, 1968, when it dismissed the case and declared the ordinance valid [1]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-29819) [2].

Following the dismissal, respondents demanded payment of the new rates and back differentials, threatening summary ejectment for non-payment [2]. Petitioners then filed the present action for prohibition (G.R. No. L-29864) to restrain the collection and ejectment [2]. The Supreme Court dismissed this action on December 3, 1968, ruling that an appeal was the proper remedy [1]. Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the threat of ejectment warranted the prohibition [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Motion for Reconsideration regarding the dismissal of the prohibition case should be granted.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court denied the Motion for Reconsideration. The relief sought by petitioners (reinstatement of the restraining order or issuance of a preliminary injunction) could be properly secured from the lower court under Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, or from the Supreme Court in the pending appealed case (G.R. No. L-29819) [3, 4].

The Court noted that petitioners had effectively engaged in forum shopping; they expressly stated that they had already filed a motion for preliminary injunction in the appealed case (G.R. No. L-29819) on November 21, 1968, which the Court had already denied on November 26, 1968 [3, 4]. The present action was merely an attempt to secure the same relief already denied in the appealed case [4, 5].

Motion for reconsideration denied [6].
