I. CAPTION
ANTONIO C. FAVIS v. THE CITY OF BAGUIO and THE SHELL COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES, LIMITED, G.R. No. L-29910, April 25, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Appellant Antonio Favis bought a parcel of land in Baguio City in 1957. His access to the main road, Lapu-Lapu Street, was via a 2.5-meter wide donated road [1, 2]. In 1961, the City Council of Baguio passed Resolution No. 132, authorizing the lease of Lot 25 and an additional 100-square-meter portion of Lapu-Lapu Street to Shell Company [3, 4]. Favis protested, arguing the lease diminished the street width and that the City lacked authority to lease public streets [5]. To address objections, the Council passed Resolution No. 215, amending the previous resolution by formally vacating the leased portion of the street and converting the remainder into a 5-meter alley (4 meters in actual use) [5]. Favis filed a suit to annul the lease and resolutions. The Court of First Instance of Baguio upheld the validity of the resolutions and dismissed the complaint [6]. Favis appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City Council of Baguio has the authority to close a public street and lease it to a private entity.
2. W/N the municipal actions were invalid because they were passed as "resolutions" rather than "ordinances" and lacked proper notice.
3. W/N the appellant is entitled to damages for the closing of the street section.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The City Council is explicitly empowered to close city streets. Subsection (L) of Section 2553 of the Revised Administrative Code (Baguio Charter) grants the City the power to "provide for laying out... closing up... any public... street" [7, 8]. The power to vacate a street is discretionary and will not be interfered with by courts absent fraud or abuse [9]. Once the strip of land was withdrawn from public use, it became patrimonial property of the State pursuant to Article 422 of the Civil Code [10]. Consequently, the City had the authority to lease this patrimonial property for its benefit under its charter powers [10].

2. **NO.** The form of the act does not affect its validity if the substance requirements are met. Even where a charter requires an ordinance, a resolution passed with the same statutory formalities (unanimous approval, signed by presiding officer and Mayor, attested by Secretary) is binding and effective as an ordinance [11, 12]. Regarding the lack of notice, the charter provision requiring notice to "interested persons" applies only when an ordinance calls for a special assessment [13]. Since the resolutions in question did not involve any assessment against the appellant or his land, such notice was not required [14].

3. **NO.** The general rule is that a property owner whose land does not abut the closed section of a street is not entitled to compensation if they still have reasonable access to the general street system [15]. Favis’s property did not abut the closed portion, and his original 2.5-meter outlet to Lapu-Lapu Street remained unchanged [16, 17]. To warrant recovery, special damages differing in kind from the general public must be shown; here, any loss suffered is *damnum absque injuria* [18].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [18].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Fernando, Teehankee, and Barredo concurred with the opinion [19].
