I. CAPTION
LEONARDO AVILA v. PEDRO M. GIMENEZ, as Auditor General, ABELARDO SUBIDO, as Commissioner of Civil Service, THE PROVINCE OF BUKIDNON, LUIS R. LLAUDER, as Provincial Treasurer of Bukidnon and MELQUIADEZ P. VARIAS, G.R. No. L-24615, February 28, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Avila, the Provincial Auditor of Bukidnon, was preventively suspended on January 13, 1951, due to the filing of a criminal case for Malversation of Public Funds and a simultaneous administrative case against him [1, 2]. In the administrative case, the Commissioner of Civil Service rendered a decision on February 12, 1953, finding Avila guilty and imposing a penalty of a one-month pay fine and a reprimand; Avila did not appeal this decision [2]. While he was initially convicted in the criminal case, the Court of Appeals later set aside the conviction and ordered a new trial [2, 3].

Avila was eventually reinstated as Acting Provincial Auditor on August 15, 1963 [4]. He subsequently filed an action to recover his back salaries covering the period of his suspension from 1951 to 1963 [1]. The lower court dismissed his petition upon the respondents' motion [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner is entitled to back salaries for the period of his preventive suspension upon reinstatement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that while Section 260 of the Revised Administrative Code provides for payment of withheld salary upon reinstatement or exoneration, established jurisprudence limits this right [5, 6]. Relying on *Gonzales v. Hernandez*, the Court ruled that back salaries may be ordered paid only if the officer is exonerated of the charge and his suspension or dismissal is found to be illegal [6, 7].

In this case, the petitioner was not completely exonerated [6]. Although he was reinstated, the administrative decision finding him guilty and imposing a fine and reprimand remained standing [6]. Therefore, his claim for back salaries cannot prosper.

The order of dismissal of the lower court is AFFIRMED [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Castro, J., reserved his vote [8].
