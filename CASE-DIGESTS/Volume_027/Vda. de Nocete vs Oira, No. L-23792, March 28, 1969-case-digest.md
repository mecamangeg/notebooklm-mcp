I. CAPTION
MODESTA JIMENEZ VDA. DE NOCETE v. PILAR OIRA, G.R. No. L-23792, March 28, 1969, Barredo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Marcelo Nocete (later substituted by his wife, Modesta) filed a complaint for forcible entry in the Municipal Court of Dumaguete against Defendant Pilar Oira regarding a portion of Lot No. 3463. The complaint alleged that in May and September 1961, the defendant entered the land, harvested coconuts, and immediately left. Plaintiff remained in actual physical possession of the land when the complaint was filed.

The Municipal Court case was appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Oriental. The CFI dismissed the case on two grounds: (1) the pleadings raised the issue of ownership, depriving the inferior court of jurisdiction; and (2) the original plaintiff died, and his widow lacked the "actual possession" requisite for forcible entry. Plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the inferior court had jurisdiction over the complaint as a case of forcible entry.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the case was not one of forcible entry because the defendant allegedly entered the land only for one day each in May and September to harvest coconuts and left immediately. At the time the complaint was filed, the plaintiff was in actual physical possession of the land [1].

For a forcible entry case to prosper, the plaintiff must seek to be restored in possession. Since the plaintiff was already in possession, the action was actually a simple one for the recovery of the cost of the coconuts (valued at P98.00) or a suit for injunction to prevent future trespassing, neither of which falls under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court as a forcible entry case [1], [2]. Consequently, the Supreme Court had no appellate jurisdiction because the inferior court lacked original jurisdiction [3].

While the Court affirmed the dismissal, it clarified that the CFI's reasoning was erroneous. First, inferior courts do not lose jurisdiction merely because ownership is raised in the pleadings; they only lose it if evidence shows possession is inextricably fused with ownership [4]. Second, forcible entry is a real action that survives the death of the plaintiff, and the estate retains the personality to continue the suit [4], [5].

The appeal is **DISMISSED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices J.B.L. Reyes and Teehankee concurred in the result.
