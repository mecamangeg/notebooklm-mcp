**I. CAPTION**
PAZ M. GARCIA v. HON. CLAUDIO TEEHANKEE, Secretary of Justice and MANUEL LINTAG, G.R. No. L-28747, April 28, 1969, Dizon, J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Paz M. Garcia was an employee assigned to the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Pasay Branch, presided over by Judge Francisco de la Rosa [3, 4]. Following an incident between Garcia and the Clerk of Court on November 21, 1967, Judge De la Rosa recommended her preventive suspension and subsequently filed an unsworn administrative charge for gross misconduct against her with the Secretary of Justice, Claudio Teehankee [5, 6]. Respondent Manuel Lintag was designated to investigate the charge [6].

Garcia filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing that under Civil Service Rules, the complaint should have been verified by the "head of office." She contended that the Executive Judge (Hon. Pedro Bautista) or the Clerk of Court was the head of office, not Judge De la Rosa, and thus the investigator lacked jurisdiction [6]. The investigator denied the motion [7]. Garcia filed a petition for prohibition with the Supreme Court to stop the investigation [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the presiding judge of a court branch is considered the "head of office" authorized to file an administrative charge against an employee officially assigned to his branch. [3, 4]

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that since the petitioner was officially assigned to work in the branch presided over by Judge De la Rosa, he is, in legal contemplation, the head of that office for purposes related to filing administrative charges [3, 4]. To hold otherwise would create an "intolerable situation" where a presiding judge is a mere figurehead without effective control or disciplinary authority over the employees working under him [8, 9].

Therefore, in accordance with Section 24, Rule 18 of the Civil Service Rules, the complaint filed by Judge De la Rosa was proper and did not require verification [4]. The Court cited *Diaz v. Arca* and *Maloga v. Gella* to support this interpretation [4, 10].

Petition denied [1].
