I. CAPTION
IN RE: PETITION FOR NATURALIZATION. LEON TE POOT also known as TE BON BENG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20017, March 28, 1969, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
On February 2, 1961, Leon Te Poot (also known as Te Bon Beng) filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Davao [1], [2]. He did not file a declaration of intention, claiming exemption on the grounds that he was born in the Philippines (Sigaboy, Davao) and completed his primary and secondary education in government-recognized schools [3]. To prove his birth, he presented his Alien Certificate of Registration and Certificate of Residence, as civil registry records were lost [4]. To prove his education, he presented a certificate from the principal of Davao Chinese High School [5]. He claimed to be employed by his father, receiving P250.00 monthly at the time of filing, plus free board and lodging, but submitted no payroll or books of account to support this [6]. He admitted using the name "Te Bon Beng" in school and "Leon Te Poot" in official documents without judicial authority [7]. His character witnesses, Ramon de los Cientos and Miguel de Castro, testified they had known him since he was 21 and 19 years old, respectively [8]. The trial court granted the petition, and the Republic appealed [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court acquired jurisdiction despite the petitioner's failure to file a declaration of intention.
2. W/N the petitioner conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner regarding his use of aliases.
3. W/N the petitioner had a lucrative trade or occupation.
4. W/N the character witnesses were competent to vouch for the petitioner.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petitioner was not exempt from filing a declaration of intention, and thus the court failed to acquire jurisdiction [3], [7]. The petitioner failed to prove his birth in the Philippines by clear and convincing evidence, as the Alien Certificate of Registration and Certificate of Residence constitute hearsay [4]. Furthermore, the certificate from the school principal was hearsay because the principal was not presented as a witness [5]. It was also not proven that the school was regularly attended by a sizeable number of Filipino students [5].

2. **NO.** The petitioner failed to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner by using different names ("Leon Te Poot" and "Te Bon Beng") on different occasions without judicial authority, in violation of the Anti-Alias Law [6]. The Court distinguished this from cases where an alias is used as a childhood name alongside the real name constantly; here, the names were used separately in different records [7].

3. **NO.** The petitioner's income was not lucrative. Qualifications are determined at the date of filing; his monthly salary of P250.00, even with free board and lodging, is not considered lucrative [2]. Moreover, the claim of employment is suspicious because the employer was his father and there were no supporting documents like payrolls or time records (*Chua Siong Hua v. Republic*) [6].

4. **NO.** Where an applicant is born in the Philippines, witnesses must be competent to vouch for his character and behavior during the *entire* period of his residence [9]. Since the witnesses only knew the petitioner starting at ages 21 and 19, respectively, they were incompetent to testify regarding his conduct during his entire residence in the Philippines (*Yap v. Republic*) [8].

The judgment is REVERSED and the petition is DENIED [10].
