I. CAPTION
ILLUH ASAALI, ET AL. v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-24170, February 28, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On September 10, 1950, a customs patrol team intercepted five Philippine-registered sailing vessels owned by petitioners on the high seas between British North Borneo and Sulu. The vessels, which were heading towards Tawi-tawi, were found carrying cases of cigarettes and rattan chairs without the required import license under Republic Act No. 426 or a permit from the Commissioner of Customs. Consequently, the Commissioner declared the vessels and cargo forfeited for smuggling. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) upheld the forfeiture, finding that the vessels' course indicated an intention to enter Philippine limits. Petitioners moved for reconsideration, arguing that the seizure was invalid because it was effected on the high seas, outside Philippine territorial jurisdiction, and that importation had not yet begun.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the seizure of the vessels and cargo on the high seas, outside Philippine territorial waters, was valid.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the seizure was valid. Section 1141 of the Revised Administrative Code, which grants the Bureau of Customs police authority over seas within Philippine jurisdiction, should not be given a restrictive significance that would negate the government's power to combat smuggling.

The Court relied on the doctrine of International Law laid down in *Church v. Hubbart* (1804), which establishes that a state's right to protect itself and its revenues is not limited to its own territory but may extend to the high seas to secure itself from injury. Given the circumstances—Philippine vessels coming from a foreign port with taxable goods and heading toward a domestic port—it was irrational to deny they were bound for the Philippines. Thus, there was ample justification to indulge in the legal fiction that the seizure took place within Philippine waters to prevent rendering the government's power nugatory.

The Motion for Reconsideration was **DENIED**.
