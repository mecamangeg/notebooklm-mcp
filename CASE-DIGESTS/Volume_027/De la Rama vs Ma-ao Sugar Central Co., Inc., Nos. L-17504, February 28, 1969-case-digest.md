I. CAPTION
RAMON DE LA RAMA, FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ, HORTENCIA SALAS, PAZ SALAS and PATRIA SALAS v. MA-AO SUGAR CENTRAL CO., INC., J. AMADO ARANETA, MRS. RAMON S. ARANETA, ROMUALDO M. ARANETA, and RAMON A. YULO, G.R. Nos. L-17504 & L-17506, February 28, 1969, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, minority stockholders of Ma-ao Sugar Central Co., Inc., filed a derivative suit against the corporation and its directors, including J. Amado Araneta [1]. They alleged illegal and ultra-vires acts, specifically questioning the investment of corporate funds in the Philippine Fiber Processing Co., Inc. (a manufacturer of sugar bags), as well as in Acoje Mining and Mabuhay Printing, without the affirmative vote of stockholders holding 2/3 of the voting power as required by Section 17-1/2 of the Corporation Law [2], [3], [4].

The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the petition for dissolution but ruled that the investment in Philippine Fiber was valid even without stockholder approval because it was necessary for the corporate purpose (manufacturing sugar bags) [5], [6]. However, the lower court permanently restrained the corporation from making future investments in Acoje Mining, Mabuhay Printing, or any other company whose purpose was not connected with the sugar central business [7]. It also ordered Araneta to pay P46,270.00 for an unpaid personal loan [7]. Both parties appealed [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the investment in Philippine Fiber Processing Co., Inc. required 2/3 stockholder approval under Sec. 17-1/2 of the Corporation Law.
2. W/N the lower court erred in prohibiting the corporation from making future investments in companies not connected with the sugar central business.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the investment in Philippine Fiber Processing Co., Inc. did not violate Sec. 17-1/2 of the Corporation Law. Citing Professor Sulpicio Guevara, the Court reconciled the apparent conflict between Sec. 13(10) (power to acquire shares to accomplish corporate purpose) and Sec. 17-1/2 (power to invest in other corporations). If the purchase of shares is done in pursuance of the corporate purpose—in this case, ensuring a supply of sugar bags for the sugar central—it does not need stockholder approval; the Board's approval suffices. Stockholder approval (2/3 vote) is only necessary when the purchase is done solely for investment and not to accomplish the main purpose of incorporation [9], [10], [11].

2. **YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's order prohibiting the corporation from investing in companies whose purpose is not connected with the sugar business. Sec. 17-1/2 of the Corporation Law expressly allows a corporation to invest its funds in any other corporation or business, or for any purpose other than its main purpose, provided the board is authorized by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 2/3 of the voting power [12]. A blanket prohibition would deny the corporation a power granted by law.

The judgment was **partly reversed** regarding the prohibition on future investments, and **partly affirmed** regarding the validity of the Philippine Fiber investment and the order for Araneta to pay P46,270.00 [13].
