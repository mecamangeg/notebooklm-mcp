I. CAPTION
GUALBERTO TENCHAVEZ v. ATLAS CONSOLIDATED MINING & DEVELOPMENT CO., ET AL., G.R. No. L-26153, March 28, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On April 14, 1967, Plaintiff Tenchavez and Defendant Atlas Consolidated Mining filed a joint petition for judgment based on a compromise agreement, which the Supreme Court approved in a decision dated May 24, 1967 [1]. However, on July 1, 1967, oppositors I.V. Binamira and F.B. Barria filed a motion for reconsideration to record their attorney's lien and claim unpaid fees [2]. They subsequently alleged that they filed Civil Case No. R-10051 in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu to declare the compromise agreement fraudulent [2]. Tenchavez initially supported this, filing a reply praying that the agreement be declared fraudulent or action deferred until the civil case was resolved [3].

Eventually, on January 3, 1969, Tenchavez and Attys. Binamira and Barria filed a "Withdrawal of Opposition to the Approval of the Compromise Agreement," praying that the May 24, 1967 judgment be declared final and that Atlas be ordered to deposit P180,000.00 with the CFI of Cebu to settle the cases [4]. Atlas and other defendants manifested they had no objection to the withdrawal provided the sum was deposited for attorney's fees and claims in the pending civil case [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the opposition to the compromise agreement should be withdrawn and the judgment declared final.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court resolved to consider the opposition withdrawn as the parties concerned interposed no objection to the withdrawal filed by Tenchavez, Binamira, and Barria [6]. The Court noted that the conditions regarding the deposit of P180,000.00 in the lower court constituted no reason to disapprove the withdrawal [6]. Consequently, the judgment by compromise rendered on May 24, 1967, was declared final and executory [6].
