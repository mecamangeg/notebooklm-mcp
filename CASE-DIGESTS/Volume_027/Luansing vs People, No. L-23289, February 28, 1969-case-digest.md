I. CAPTION
JOVENCIO LUANSING v. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-23289, February 28, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jovencio Luansing was originally charged with rape, but the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Batangas dismissed the charge and directed the filing of an information for seduction. The Fiscal filed an information alleging Luansing seduced Felisa Hernandez, a virgin over 12 but under 18 years of age, through deceit and false promise of marriage. During the trial, the private prosecutor expressly reserved the right to file a separate civil action. The CFI convicted Luansing of seduction, sentencing him to *arresto mayor*, and ordering him to indemnify the offended party, acknowledge their offspring, and provide monthly support. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision *in toto*. Luansing appealed, challenging the CFI's jurisdiction over the offense and the award of civil liability.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the crime of simple seduction, which is punishable by *arresto mayor*.
2. W/N the information was defective for failing to explicitly allege "lewd design."
3. W/N the trial court could award indemnity and support despite the reservation of a separate civil action.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While the penalty for simple seduction under Article 338 of the Revised Penal Code is *arresto mayor*—which normally falls under the jurisdiction of Municipal Courts—the crime also carries the liability to acknowledge and support the offspring under Article 345. These accessory civil liabilities are matters beyond the jurisdiction of Municipal Courts and pertain to the Court of First Instance. It would be absurd and wasteful to split the jurisdiction between the Municipal Court (for the crime) and the CFI (for acknowledgment and support) (*U.S. v. Bernardo*).

2. **NO.** Explicit allegation of "lewd design" is not necessary because it is inherent in the very act of having sexual intercourse with a chaste woman under a false promise of marriage (*People v. Obsania*).

3. **NO.** The reservation to file a separate civil action was valid and was not abandoned. Abandonment requires more convincing evidence than mere forbearance. Furthermore, the claim for damages and support requires proof and the right of the defendant to present rebuttal evidence, which was not accorded in this case.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **MODIFIED** by eliminating the award of damages and support for the offspring, and **AFFIRMED** in all other respects.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Barredo, J. (Concurring):** Concurred with the decision but offered observations regarding the joinder of causes of action under Rule 2, Section 5, asserting that a superior court having jurisdiction over a main action (like admiralty) retains jurisdiction over joined causes of action even if they fall below the jurisdictional limit.
