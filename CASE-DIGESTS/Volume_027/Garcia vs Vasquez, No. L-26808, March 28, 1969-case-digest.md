I. CAPTION
REV. FATHER LUCIO V. GARCIA v. HON. CONRADO M. VASQUEZ, G.R. No. L-26808, March 28, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rev. Father Lucio V. Garcia filed a separate petition for the allowance of a will of the decedent Gliceria A. del Rosario [1, 2]. He refused to pay the docket fees amounting to P940.00, arguing that another party, Consuelo Gonzales, had previously filed a petition for the probate of a different alleged will of the same decedent and had already paid the corresponding fees [3]. Petitioner contended that no additional fees were needed as both petitions referred to the settlement of the same estate [1]. Respondent Judge Conrado M. Vasquez ordered petitioner to pay the fees within 15 days or face dismissal [1]. Petitioner paid under protest and filed a petition for certiorari, alleging the Judge committed grave abuse of discretion [1, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petitioner is exempt from paying docket fees for the probate of a will if docket fees were already paid in a prior pending probate petition regarding the same estate.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that there is no escape from the payment of docket fees; otherwise, the court is not called upon to act on the petition [5]. The mere fact that there is only one decedent does not vary the rule, as a decedent may leave various wills, and the petitioner chose to file a separate action rather than seeking probate in the existing proceeding [2].

Citing Rule 141, Section 5, par. (e) of the Rules of Court, the Court explained that fees are collected for "all clerical services in the allowance of will" based on the value of the property [6]. The docket fee pays for the specific clerical service of allowing the particular will presented, and must be collected at the outset without exception [6]. Thus, the respondent Judge acted in accordance with the clear tenor of the law and did not abuse his discretion [6].

Petition denied [7].
