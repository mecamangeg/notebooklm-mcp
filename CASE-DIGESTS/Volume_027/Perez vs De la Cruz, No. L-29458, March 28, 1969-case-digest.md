I. CAPTION
VIRGINIA F. PEREZ v. HON. RAFAEL DE LA CRUZ, REYNALDO BORJA, ROBERTO RUELO, FELICISIMO DE ASIS and CARLOS DEL CASTILLO, G.R. No. L-29458, March 28, 1969, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Virginia Perez, the Vice-Mayor of Naga City, sought to vote in the selection of the Secretary of the Municipal Board and chairmanships of standing committees. She claimed that as the presiding officer, she was also a member of the Board, entitled to vote to create a tie and then vote again to break it. The Board consisted of seven councilors: four Nacionalistas (respondents) and three Liberals. The respondents filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Sur to prevent Perez from voting except in the case of a deadlock. The CFI issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining Perez from voting on legislative matters unless there was a tie. Perez challenged the CFI's jurisdiction and argued that under Republic Act No. 2259, which made the Vice-Mayor the presiding officer, she acquired the membership status previously held by the Mayor under the Naga City Charter (R.A. 305).

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Vice-Mayor of Naga City is a member of the Municipal Board.
2. W/N the Vice-Mayor can vote twice in Board proceedings (once to create a tie and again to break it).
3. W/N the court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of prohibition against the Vice-Mayor regarding legislative functions.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Charter of the City of Naga (R.A. 305) does not provide that the Vice-Mayor is a member of the Municipal Board; in fact, the charter did not originally provide for the position of Vice-Mayor [1], [2]. While R.A. 2259 created the position and made the Vice-Mayor the "presiding officer" of the Board, it did not explicitly install the Vice-Mayor as a member [3]. Mere designation as a presiding officer does not *ipso jure* confer membership status [4]. Unlike the charters of Quezon City or Cagayan de Oro, which expressly state the Vice-Mayor is a member, the Naga Charter is silent, and the Court cannot read into the law something that is not there [5], [6].

2. **NO.** Since the petitioner is not a constituent member of the Board, she cannot vote as such. She possesses only the powers of a "presiding officer," which allows voting only in the case of a tie [4]. She cannot vote twice—once to create a deadlock and the second time to break it [7]. Furthermore, the Mayor, whom she replaced as presiding officer, was restricted by law to voting only in case of a tie; the Vice-Mayor cannot possess greater power than the official she replaced [8].

3. **YES.** Courts have explicit statutory authority to determine the validity of municipal proceedings [9]. The doctrine in *Vera v. Avelino*, which limits judicial interference in legislative functions based on separation of powers, is not strictly applicable to local governments [10]. The petitioner acted without jurisdiction by insisting on voting twice, and thus may be validly restrained by a writ of prohibition [9].

Petition denied and preliminary injunction dissolved.
