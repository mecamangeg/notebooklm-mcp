I. CAPTION
MARIANO C. ATEGA v. HON. MONTANO A. ORTIZ, District Judge of the Court of First Instance of Agusan, G.R. No. L-24775, March 28, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Mariano C. Atega was the awardee of a parcel of land by the Bureau of Lands, following a sale in 1941 [1]. Several adverse claimants (Sarnillo, et al.) occupied the land but were ordered to vacate by the Bureau of Lands in 1949, a decision affirmed by the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the Office of the President [2, 3]. Following a failed criminal prosecution of the occupants, Atega filed Civil Case No. 186 in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan on February 9, 1965, entitled “Contempt, Damages and Writ of Possession” [4]. The complaint sought a writ of possession, a declaration of contempt against the defendants for disobeying the administrative decision, and payment of P5,000.00 yearly damages and P10,000.00 moral damages [5].

Before summons could be served, respondent Judge Montano A. Ortiz *motu proprio* dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction [6]. Judge Ortiz reasoned that the petition arose from a purely administrative case within the Bureau of Lands and not a case instituted in court [6]. Atega filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied, leading to this petition for certiorari [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction over the action filed by the petitioner.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the respondent Judge committed a serious error in dismissing the case *motu proprio* on the ground of lack of jurisdiction [7].

The Court reasoned that the Judge erroneously considered the case merely as a proceeding for contempt regarding the Bureau of Lands' decision [7]. A review of the allegations and the relief prayed for in the complaint revealed that it was principally an action to recover possession of land and to recover damages (yearly damages of P5,000.00 and moral damages of P10,000.00) [7]. Actions for the recovery of possession of land and damages fall clearly within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance [7].

The order appealed from was set aside, and the lower court was ordered to conduct proper proceedings in Civil Case No. 186 [8].
