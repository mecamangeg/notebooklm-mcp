I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DOMINGO MAGCAMIT, G.R. No. L-25555, March 28, 1969, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of June 6, 1962, in Boac, Marinduque, appellant Domingo Magcamit and his co-accused Juan Labay stoned the house of Lamberto Lazo. When the victim, Arceo Montemar, came out of the house and walked towards a neighbor's, Magcamit suddenly held him fast by the waist from behind and commanded Labay, "Upakan mo na bayaw, ito ang kasira ko" (Attack him now, brother-in-law, this is my enemy) [1]. Labay immediately struck Montemar on the neck with a bolo, killing him [1, 2].

Labay pleaded guilty during the trial but was sentenced only to an indeterminate penalty [3]. The Court of First Instance of Marinduque convicted Magcamit of murder, sentencing him to 17 years and 4 months to life imprisonment [3]. Magcamit appealed, arguing that the evidence failed to establish conspiracy and treachery, and noting a contradiction between witnesses regarding the exact words uttered ("Tirahin" vs. "Upakan") [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the crime was committed with treachery and conspiracy.
2. W/N there was a material contradiction in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses sufficient to discredit them.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that treachery was clearly present because the attack was sudden and unexpected, rendering the victim helpless as he was held by Magcamit [2, 4]. Conspiracy was established by the previous concert of criminal design, evidenced by the concerted action of the accused and Magcamit's specific command to Labay to attack the victim [4].

2. **NO.** The alleged contradiction—where one witness heard "Tirahin mo na" and another heard "Upakan mo na"—is untenable [4]. The Court held that both expressions have the same meaning. Furthermore, the variation was natural given the distance of the witnesses from the scene; the eyewitness was seven meters away, while the co-accused (Labay) was closer [4, 5].

**Disposition:** The judgment is **MODIFIED**. Appellant Magcamit is sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* (medium degree) as no aggravating or mitigating circumstances attended the crime. The civil indemnity is raised to P12,000 [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Barredo, J. (Concurring):**
Justice Barredo clarified the procedure regarding the co-accused Labay (who did not appeal). He noted that the trial court erred in deferring Labay's sentence and in considering his plea of guilty as a mitigating circumstance, as the plea was entered after the prosecution had already presented witnesses [7, 8]. However, since Labay did not appeal, his sentence could no longer be changed [8].
