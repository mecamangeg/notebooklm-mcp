I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ARASA HAN, ANJAL JAWALIL and YAKAN PAHOTO, G.R. No. L-22945, April 25, 1969, Teehankee, J.

II. FACTS
On February 5, 1964, in Basilan City, three armed men entered the house of Eugenio Villarin, stole personal effects worth P100.00, and hacked Eugenio to death. Emiliana Villarin, the victim's daughter, recognized two of the intruders as Arasa Han and Anjal Jawalil but could not name the third man. Upon arrest, Han and Jawalil executed affidavits admitting the crime and implicating Yakan Pahoto as their companion. The Court of First Instance of Basilan City convicted all three of Robbery with Homicide, sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua*. Han and Jawalil withdrew their appeals, leaving Pahoto as the sole appellant. At trial, Emiliana failed to positively identify Pahoto, and Pahoto denied participation, presenting an alibi. The conviction rested primarily on the affidavits of the co-accused.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the extrajudicial affidavits of the co-accused are sufficient to convict the appellant in the absence of positive identification.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the judgment and acquitted Yakan Pahoto. The prosecution failed to identify the appellant as the third perpetrator beyond reasonable doubt. The records showed that the eyewitness, Emiliana, failed to positively identify Pahoto during the trial.

Furthermore, the affidavits of co-accused Han and Jawalil, while admissible as admissions against themselves, cannot be considered valid evidence against Pahoto. Under Rule 130, Sec. 27 (now Sec. 30), the act or declaration of a conspirator may only be given in evidence against a co-conspirator after the conspiracy is shown by evidence other than such declaration. Absent independent proof of conspiracy, the extrajudicial confessions of the co-accused implicate the *res inter alios acta* rule and are inadmissible against the appellant. The Solicitor General conceded that the evidence was insufficient to prove guilt.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
