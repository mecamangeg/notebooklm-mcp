I. CAPTION
ALFONSO VISITACION v. VICTOR MANIT, substituted by his widow LEONARDA MANIT and daughters VIRGINIA DUNGOG, VICTORIA BATUCAN and MERLINDA MANIT, G.R. No. L-27231, March 28, 1969, Teehankee, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Visitacion sued Victor Manit for subsidiary liability regarding the death of Visitacion's son caused by Manit's driver. During the trial, Victor Manit died. In accordance with Rule 3, Section 17, the plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint substituting the deceased's widow and daughters as defendants. Atty. Garcia, the counsel of record, acknowledged receipt of the Amended Complaint as "Attorney for the defendants" and successfully moved for an extension of time to file an answer. However, on January 27, 1960, one day before the scheduled hearing, Atty. Garcia filed a "Motion to Withdraw as Counsel," claiming the heirs had not hired him. Neither Atty. Garcia nor the defendants appeared at the hearing the next day. The trial court proceeded and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff. Atty. Garcia appealed, arguing the heirs were not under the court's jurisdiction due to lack of summons and that his withdrawal should have been recognized.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the substituted defendants required service of summons to be placed under the court's jurisdiction.
2. W/N the trial court erred in ignoring the counsel's motion to withdraw filed one day before trial.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the issuance of summons was unnecessary. The record showed that Atty. Garcia acknowledged receipt of the Amended Complaint as "Attorney for the defendants," presented no opposition, and prayed for an extension of time to answer. By these acts, the substituted defendants were duly impleaded and submitted to the court's jurisdiction through their counsel.
2. **NO.** The motion to withdraw was properly ignored as it was filed too late, was not verified, and failed to provide notice to the clients as required by Rule 138, Section 26 and Rule 15, Section 4 of the Rules of Court. An attorney cannot presume that the court will grant a withdrawal; the attorney-client relation continues until formally terminated. The counsel's failure to appear was inexcusable, and the claim that the defendants were denied their day in court was rejected as the widow had previously testified and participated in the case.

The judgment is AFFIRMED, with double costs to be paid by the attorney for the defendants.
