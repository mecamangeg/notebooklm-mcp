**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE CHANGE OF NAME OF YAP EK SIU, petitioner-appellee, vs. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, oppositor-appellant, G.R. No. L-25437, April 28, 1969, Fernando, J.

**II. FACTS**
Yap Ek Siu, a Chinese citizen, filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Negros Oriental to change his name to "William Tanchon." He testified that his Filipino childhood playmates called him "William" and that he desired to adopt the surname "Tanchon" out of respect for his father, Pio Tanchon, a naturalized Filipino who was judicially authorized to use said surname [1]. The Republic opposed the petition, arguing that as a Chinese citizen, using a Filipino name would cause confusion rather than avoid it [2, 3]. The lower court granted the petition, finding the petitioner's reasons proper and reasonable [4]. The Republic appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner has established proper and reasonable cause to justify a change of name.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that under Article 376 of the Civil Code, a change of name is a privilege and not a matter of right [5]. To be authorized, a petitioner must show proper or reasonable cause, such as when the name is ridiculous, tainted with dishonor, difficult to write or pronounce, or when the change is necessary to avoid confusion (*Ong Peng Oan v. Republic*; *Yu Chi Han v. Republic*) [6].

In this case, the petitioner failed to meet these standards. The Court found that allowing the petitioner, who admitted to being a Chinese citizen, to use the Filipino name "William Tanchon" would create confusion in his social and business dealings by making him appear to be Filipino [2, 7]. Furthermore, the fact that he was called "William" by playmates and his desire for filial respect toward his naturalized father were not considered compelling reasons to grant the privilege [7].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** [8].
