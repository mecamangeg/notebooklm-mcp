I. CAPTION
In the Matter of Attorney Lope E. Adriano; PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. REMIGIO ESTEBIA, G.R. No. L-26868, February 27, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Remigio Estebia was convicted of rape and sentenced to death by the CFI of Samar. On December 14, 1966, the Supreme Court appointed Atty. Lope E. Adriano as counsel *de oficio* for the automatic review of the case. Adriano requested and was granted five extensions to file the appellant's brief, representing in his motions that the brief was "almost through" and needed only minor corrections. The final deadline set was April 26, 1967, but Adriano failed to file the brief. The Court issued a show-cause order on September 25, 1967, which Adriano ignored. On October 3, 1968, the Court imposed a P500 fine and warned of drastic disciplinary action; Adriano paid no heed. On December 5, 1968, the Court ordered him to show cause why he should not be suspended. Despite personal receipt of the order, he failed to comply or offer any explanation.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Atty. Adriano should be suspended for gross misconduct and violation of his oath.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court found Atty. Adriano guilty of gross misconduct and violation of his oath of office.

A counsel *de oficio* bears a duty to exert his best efforts for an indigent client, a responsibility equal to that of a hired counsel [1, 2]. Under Canon 4 of the Canons of Professional Ethics and Section 31, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, Adriano was obligated to render effective assistance [1]. His failure to file the brief despite a lapse of over two years and his misleading representations regarding the brief's status violated this duty [3, 4].

Furthermore, a lawyer is sworn to observe and maintain respect for the courts and obey lawful orders (Sec. 20(b), Rule 138; Canon 1) [5]. Adriano's repeated failure to comply with three Court resolutions—including the payment of a fine and the submission of explanations—demonstrated "contumacy and unwillingness to comply with the lawful orders" of the Court [6, 7].

Atty. Lope E. Adriano is **SUSPENDED** from the practice of law throughout the Philippines for one year [8].
