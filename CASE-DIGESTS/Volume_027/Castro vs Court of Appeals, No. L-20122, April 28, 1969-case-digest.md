I. CAPTION
FELICIANO A. CASTRO v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, EUGENIA SORIANO DE GOMEZ, et al., G.R. No. L-20122, April 28, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Alejandra Austria filed an application for the registration of ten parcels of land. Socorro A. Castro opposed, alleging that Alejandra donated the lands to her in 1939 through a deed titled "Donacion Onerosa e Intervivos." The Heirs of Antonio Ventenilla (Alejandra’s deceased husband) also opposed, claiming the lands belonged to Antonio and that Alejandra was merely a usufructuary.

In a previous case (*Austria v. Heirs of Antonio Ventenilla*, 1956), the Supreme Court affirmed that Alejandra was the residuary legatee of Antonio’s estate, not a mere usufructuary. Despite this, the Court of Appeals (CA) dismissed Socorro’s appeal. The CA affirmed the trial court's ruling that while Alejandra had possession, the donation to Socorro was *mortis causa* because the deed stipulated that the usufruct and naked ownership would consolidate upon the donor's death. The CA held the donation void for failing to observe the formalities of a will required under Article 620 of the old Civil Code.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Alejandra Austria was the owner of the properties with the right to donate them.
2. W/N the donation executed by Alejandra in favor of Socorro was *inter vivos* or *mortis causa*.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the issue of ownership was *res judicata*. In the 1956 case of *Austria v. Heirs of Antonio Ventenilla*, the Court settled that Alejandra was the residuary legatee of her husband's estate, not just a usufructuary [1]. As the owner, she had the right to dispose of the properties [1], [2].

2. **INTER VIVOS.** The Court ruled the donation was *inter vivos* and valid. Whether a donation is *inter vivos* or *mortis causa* depends on the nature of the disposition and the donor's intent [3]. The deed explicitly stated "cedo y traspaso" (I cede and transfer) and was titled "Donacion Onerosa e Intervivos," indicating an intent to transfer ownership immediately [4], [5]. The condition that the usufruct and naked ownership would "consolidate" upon the donor's death implies that naked ownership was already transferred during the donor's lifetime, with the donor merely reserving the usufruct [5]. Citing *Concepcion v. Concepcion*, the Court held that postponement of possession/enjoyment until death does not convert a donation into a testamentary disposition if title is transferred immediately [5].

The petition is **GRANTED**. The decision of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED**, and the lands are ordered registered in the name of the Intestate Estate of Socorro A. Castro [6].
