I. CAPTION
MARIANO LL. BADELLES v. CAMILO P. CABILI; BONIFACIO P. LEGASPI and CECILIO T. BARAZON v. FELIX Z. ACTUB, et al., G.R. Nos. L-29333 & L-29334, February 27, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Following the November 14, 1967 elections in Iligan City, Mariano Badelles protested the proclamation of Camilo Cabili as Mayor, while Bonifacio Legaspi and Cecilio Barazon protested the election of Felix Actub and others as councilors [1, 2]. The protestants alleged flagrant violations of election laws, including the registration of over 200 voters per precinct, lack of publication of voter lists, and that approximately 8,300 illegal votes were cast while 8,000 qualified voters were disenfranchised due to missing records [3-5].

The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Lanao del Norte dismissed both protests for lack of cause of action [1, 6]. The CFI reasoned that the petitions failed to allege that the irregularities would change the election results in favor of the protestants, or that the protestees participated in the frauds [7, 8]. The lower court held that without such allegations, inquiring into the irregularities would be unjustified as it would not result in the protestants being declared the winners [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an election protest must specifically allege that the irregularities would change the result in favor of the protestant to state a valid cause of action.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the order of dismissal. The Court held that a motion to dismiss amounts to a hypothetical admission of the facts pleaded [9]. While the petitions were not skillfully drafted, the seriousness of the allegations—imputing a failure to conduct free and honest elections—gave rise to rational doubts as to who the duly elected officials were [9]. To dismiss the case summarily would amount to a "judicial abnegation of a sworn duty to inquire into and pass upon" such misconduct [10].

Citing *Abes v. Commission on Elections* and *City Board of Canvassers v. Moscoso*, the Court reiterated that the proper remedy for allegations of widespread fraud and terrorism is an election protest, not a pre-proclamation controversy [10-12]. The Court emphasized that the right of suffrage must be preserved and that corruption should not taint the electoral process [13, 14]. Consequently, the protestees were required to answer, and the lower court was ordered to ascertain the facts [15].

The order of dismissal was reversed and the cases were remanded to the lower court for trial [16].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Barredo, J. (Concurring):**
Justice Barredo emphasized that an election protest may be filed not only to claim victory but also solely to annul the election [17]. He argued the trial court erred in ruling that the protestants must allege they would be the winners, as the law (Section 177, Revised Election Code) authorizes courts to declare that *no one* has been legally elected [17, 18]. He concluded that the petitions sufficiently alleged irregularities that, if proven, could warrant the annulment of the elections [19].
