I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ODONCIO TARRAYO, et al. (SALVADOR EGANG and FELIPE ROBLES, defendants-appellants)**, G.R. No. L-26489, April 21, 1969, 27 SCRA 953, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On May 28, 1966, in San Jose, Samar, appellants Salvador Egang and Felipe Robles, together with Odoncio and Felipe Tarrayo (who remained at large), conspired to rob the house of Olimpio Gremio. At around 10:00 P.M., armed with bolos and a coconut husker (*palaw*), they entered the victim's dwelling. Egang struck Olimpio with the *palaw*, killing him instantly. Robles took P5.75 from the victim and his mother. Subsequently, Egang and Robles dragged Olimpio's daughter, Rosilla, to a nearby plantation and took turns raping her.

Charged with "robbery with homicide with rape," Egang and Robles pleaded guilty despite the trial judge's warning of the serious consequences. The trial court convicted them of robbery with homicide and rape, appreciating the aggravating circumstances of nighttime, superior strength, dwelling, and uninhabited place, with the plea of guilty as the sole mitigating circumstance. They were sentenced to death. The case was elevated for automatic review.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the plea of guilty constitutes an admission of all material allegations in the information.
2. W/N the aggravating circumstance of "uninhabited place" was correctly appreciated.
3. W/N the imposition of the death penalty was correct.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A plea of guilty, when the accused is duly advised by counsel and the court, is deemed an admission of all the material allegations in the information, including the aggravating circumstances alleged therein [1].

2. **NO.** The circumstance of "uninhabited place" should not have been appreciated. Although the nearest house was 150 meters away, there was no showing that the appellants purposely sought the isolation of the place to attain their objective without interference or to secure themselves against recognition and punishment [1].

3. **YES.** The crime committed is robbery with homicide (Art. 294, RPC). The rape committed on the occasion thereof is considered an aggravating circumstance, not a separate offense [1]. The Court found that the crime was attended by the aggravating circumstances of nighttime, abuse of superior strength, dwelling, rape, and—although not appreciated by the trial court but properly averred in the information—evident premeditation and band [2]. With five or more aggravating circumstances and only one mitigating circumstance (plea of guilty), the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* to death must be imposed in its maximum period [3].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision is **AFFIRMED**; the accused Salvador Egang and Felipe Robles are imposed the death penalty and ordered to indemnify the heirs.
