**I. CAPTION**
FIREMAN’S FUND INSURANCE COMPANY v. MAERSK LINE FAR EAST SERVICE, et al., G.R. No. L-27189, March 28, 1969, Castro, J.

**II. FACTS**
Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company (Fireman’s Fund), as subrogee of the consignee American Asiatic Distributors, Inc., filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to recover P5,755.22, representing the value of seven packages of pipe fittings lost while in the custody of the defendants [1]. The complaint was filed against Maersk Line Far East Service (Maersk Line) and/or the Customs Arrastre Service (CAS) [1]. The CFI dismissed the case against Maersk Line but rendered judgment in favor of Fireman’s Fund and against CAS [1]. CAS appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that as a government entity, it is immune from suit [2]. Although both parties failed to file their briefs, the Court proceeded to decide the appeal to save time and expense [3, 4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Customs Arrastre Service is immune from suit.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Customs Arrastre Service is immune from suit [5].

The Supreme Court ruled that the CAS is merely a unit of the Bureau of Customs, which is part of the Department of Finance and has no legal personality apart from the National Government [2, 6]. The primary function of the Bureau of Customs is governmental—assessing and collecting revenues—and the arrastre service is a "necessary incident" to this function [6]. Citing *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service*, the Court held that even if the arrastre service is proprietary in nature, its performance as an incident to a prime governmental function does not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity [7, 8]. Consequently, the State cannot be sued without its consent [5]. The remedy for the plaintiff is to file a money claim with the Auditor General pursuant to Act 3083 and Commonwealth Act 327 [9].

**Judgment reversed and complaint dismissed.** [10, 11]
