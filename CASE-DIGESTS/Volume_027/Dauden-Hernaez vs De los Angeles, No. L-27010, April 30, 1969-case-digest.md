I. CAPTION
MARLENE DAUDEN-HERNAEZ v. HON. WALFRIDO DE LOS ANGELES, HOLLYWOOD FAR EAST PRODUCTIONS, INC., and RAMON VALENZUELA, G.R. No. L-27010, April 30, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., Acting C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Marlene Dauden-Hernaez, a motion picture actress, filed a complaint against respondents Hollywood Far East Productions, Inc. and its President, Ramon Valenzuela, to recover P14,700.00 representing the unpaid balance for her services in two motion pictures. The respondent Judge De los Angeles dismissed the complaint, ruling that the claim was not evidenced by a written document, either public or private, which violated Articles 1356 and 1358 of the Civil Code. Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration and sought to admit an amended complaint, but the court denied both. A second motion for reconsideration was also denied for being *pro forma*, and the court declared the dismissal final. [1]

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court erred in dismissing the complaint without giving the plaintiff an opportunity to amend.
2. W/N a contract for personal services involving more than P500.00 is invalid or unenforceable if not in writing.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that when a motion to dismiss is sustained, it is error to dismiss the complaint without granting the plaintiff an opportunity to amend, unless the defect is incurable [2]. A motion to dismiss is not a responsive pleading; thus, under Section 1, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court, a party may amend their pleading once as a matter of course before a responsive pleading is served [3]. The Court also ruled that the second motion for reconsideration was not *pro forma* as it raised the new ground of the court's refusal to admit the amended complaint [4].

2. **NO.** The lower court abused its discretion in ruling that the contract was invalid or unenforceable. Under Article 1356 of the Civil Code, contracts are obligatory in whatever form they may have been entered into, provided the essential requisites of consent, subject matter, and cause are present [5]. The exceptions are only when the law requires a form for validity (solemn contracts) or for enforceability (Statute of Frauds) [6-8]. While Article 1358 states that contracts involving more than P500.00 must appear in writing, this requirement is for convenience only, not for validity or enforceability [8]. Article 1357 clarifies that parties may compel each other to observe the form once the contract is perfected [9].

The order dismissing the complaint is set aside, and the case is remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings. [10]
