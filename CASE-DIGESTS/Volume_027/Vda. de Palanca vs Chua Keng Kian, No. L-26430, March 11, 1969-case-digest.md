I. CAPTION
ROSA GONZALES VDA. DE PALANCA, et al. v. CHUA KENG KIAN and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-26430, March 11, 1969, 27 SCRA 356, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Roman Ozaeta, executor of the estate of Carlos Palanca (later substituted by petitioners Heirs of Palanca), filed an unlawful detainer case against respondent Chua Keng Kian in the Municipal Court of Manila for refusal to vacate a leased lot. The Municipal Court ruled in favor of petitioners. Respondent appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The appeal was docketed, and respondent filed his answer on June 28, 1963. After the CFI denied plaintiff's motions regarding the counterclaim and deposits in August 1963, no further action was taken by either party. On October 20, 1964, after over one year and three months of inaction, the CFI *motu proprio* dismissed respondent's appeal for failure to prosecute. The Court of Appeals (CA) set aside the dismissal, ruling that the period of inaction was insufficient and proceeding on the premise that the Municipal Court judgment was vacated by the appeal. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CFI properly dismissed the defendant's appeal for failure to prosecute after a period of inaction of over one year.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CA and affirmed the CFI's dismissal order. The question of dismissing a case for failure to prosecute is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion [1-3]. The Court clarified that unlike in ordinary actions, a judgment rendered by an inferior court in forcible entry or illegal detainer is *not* vacated by appeal; it continues in force and may be executed unless stayed by bond and deposits [4-6]. Since unlawful detainer is a special civil action meant to be summary in character, public policy demands greater diligence from defendants-appellants to expedite the disposal of such cases [7-9]. The Court held that inaction for over one year and three months is sufficient to warrant dismissal, citing *Chuan v. De la Fuente* and *Villanueva v. Secretary of Public Works* [10-12].

Petition granted; order of dismissal affirmed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Barredo, J., Concurring and Dissenting:**
Justice Barredo concurred on the need for speedy case disposition but dissented on the dismissal of the appeal. He argued that once an appeal is docketed in the CFI, the case stands for trial *de novo* as if originally commenced there, meaning the duty to prosecute devolves upon the *plaintiff* to prove their case, not the defendant-appellant. He posited that if there is a failure to prosecute, the *complaint* (not the appeal) should be dismissed. He further contended that the respondent's one-year inaction was not unreasonable [13-16].
