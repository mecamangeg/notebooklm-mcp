I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and THE COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION v. HON. MANOLO L. MADDELA, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Quezon, Branch II, MIGUELA TAN SUAT, and CHAN PO LAN, G.R. Nos. L-21664 & L-21665, March 28, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Miguela Tan Suat and Chan Po Lan, both Chinese nationals, filed separate petitions in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon to be declared Filipino citizens, alleging they were married to Filipino husbands [1, 2]. The Solicitor General was not furnished copies of the petitions [3]. On April 29, 1963, respondent Judge Maddela rendered decisions declaring the private respondents Filipino citizens by marriage and ordering the Commissioner of Immigration to cancel their alien certificates [3, 4]. The Solicitor General, unable to perfect an appeal due to the Clerk of Court's failure to forward the records, filed petitions for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court to annul the lower court's judgments [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for the judicial declaration of citizenship is a valid proceeding under Philippine law [5].

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court granted the writs and set aside the lower court's decisions [6]. The Court held that under Philippine laws, there can be no action or proceeding for the judicial declaration of the citizenship of an individual [5]. Courts of justice exist for the settlement of justiciable controversies, and while a court may pass upon status (such as citizenship) as an incident to the adjudication of rights, a standalone pronouncement on such status is beyond judicial power [5]. Citing *Tan v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-14159), the Court emphasized that there is no legislation authorizing the institution of a judicial proceeding to declare that a given person is part of the citizenry [5]. The writs of preliminary injunction previously issued were made permanent [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Fernando, Capistrano, Teehankee, and Barredo, JJ., concurred [6].
