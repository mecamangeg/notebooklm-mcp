I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PEDRO FIGUEROA, BOY AHIJAL, CELEDONIO CARINGAL, KARIM JAUKAL, RAJAH MAHAMMAD, MUSTALI GAJA, ALI MAHAMMAD, STAJI BADTANG, and ENTAS BAANG**, G.R. No. L-24273, April 30, 1969, 27 SCRA 1239, Teehankee, J.

II. FACTS
On December 13, 1964, Pedro Figueroa and eight others were apprehended by the Philippine Navy off Tara Island, Palawan, possessing 388 cases of untaxed "blue seal" cigarettes. They were brought to Manila, where they executed sworn statements admitting their guilt before Provincial Fiscal Alviar and waived the provisions of Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code. Fiscal Alviar subsequently instructed Assistant Fiscal Abaca in Puerto Princesa to file the corresponding information. To obviate technical defects, Alviar suggested Abaca conduct a new investigation in Palawan by having the accused affirm their Manila statements. On December 19, 1964, in Puerto Princesa, Abaca conducted this investigation; the accused affirmed their previous statements and the information was filed the same day. The accused later filed a Motion to Quash, alleging violation of Rule 112, Section 14 due to the lack of a proper preliminary investigation. The Court of First Instance of Palawan granted the motion and dismissed the information, ruling that the investigation was too "hurried" and insufficient after placing Fiscal Abaca on the witness stand and subjecting him to cross-examination. The State appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court correctly quashed the information due to the alleged lack of ample opportunity to be heard in the preliminary investigation.
2. W/N the procedure of asking the accused to affirm their previous sworn statements constitutes a valid preliminary investigation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal as patently erroneous. Even if the trial court felt the preliminary investigation was insufficient, the proper procedure is not to dismiss the information but to hold the case in abeyance and conduct its own investigation or require the fiscal to hold a reinvestigation (*People v. Casiano*). The absence of a preliminary investigation does not impair the validity of the information or the court's jurisdiction. Furthermore, under Rule 112, Section 15, for detained persons arrested without a warrant, the fiscal is authorized to file the case immediately. The accused failed to exercise their right to request a reinvestigation within the prescribed five-day period after learning of the information.

2. **YES.** The Court held that where a witness or accused has previously given a statement, asking them to affirm the truth and correctness of said statement is a perfectly valid procedure to avoid needless waste of time. Requiring the fiscal to repeat the questions would serve no useful purpose, particularly since the accused admitted their apprehension *in flagrante delicto* and did not repudiate their statements. The fiscal substantially complied with Rule 112, Section 14. The Court also noted that the trial court's procedure of subjecting the investigating fiscal to cross-examination was highly improper and disregarded the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty.

The Order appealed from is set aside, and the lower court is directed to proceed with the arraignment and trial.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Reyes, J.B.L., Actg. C.J., concurred and certified that Chief Justice Concepcion and Justice Castro voted for setting aside the order and remanding the case.
