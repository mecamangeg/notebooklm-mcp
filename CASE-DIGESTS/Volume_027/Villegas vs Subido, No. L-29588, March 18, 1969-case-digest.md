I. CAPTION
ANTONIO J. VILLEGAS, ETC., ET AL. v. ABELARDO SUBIDO, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-29588, March 18, 1969, 27 SCRA 298, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Gregorio A. Ejercito filed a motion charging respondent Civil Service Commissioner Abelardo Subido with contempt of court. This arose from Subido's alleged failure to obey a final Supreme Court judgment which commanded him to: (1) forthwith approve and release Ejercito's appointment as City Legal Officer of Manila; and (2) act on the appointments of 28 staff members within 30 days.

In purported compliance, Subido approved Ejercito's appointment only as "provisional" under Section 24(c) of the Civil Service Law, effective January 11, 1969. He returned the 28 other appointments "without action," claiming no merit and promotion plan for Manila had been received. Petitioners argued this constituted disobedience to the Court's mandate [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Civil Service Commissioner is guilty of contempt of court for his manner of compliance with the Supreme Court judgment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that while the Commissioner failed to comply with the letter and spirit of the decision, it was not shown that he **willfully** disobeyed the final judgment.

Regarding Ejercito, the Court found that the Commissioner ignored the finding that Ejercito was qualified; thus, the appointment should have been permanent ("Promotion") effective January 1, 1968, not provisional effective January 11, 1969 [5]. regarding the 28 staff members, the order "to act" meant to process and verify eligibility, not to return them "without action" [6, 7]. However, since the Commissioner acted in consultation with the Solicitor General, the Court refrained from finding him in contempt.

The motion for contempt is **DENIED**. However, the Respondent is **ORDERED** to approve Ejercito's promotional appointment effective January 1, 1968, under Section 24(b) of the Civil Service Law, and to process the 28 staff appointments upon verification of their eligibility [8].
