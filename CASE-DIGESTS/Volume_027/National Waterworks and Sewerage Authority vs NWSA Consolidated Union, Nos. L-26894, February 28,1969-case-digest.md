I. CAPTION
NATIONAL WATERWORKS & SEWERAGE AUTHORITY v. NWSA CONSOLIDATED UNION, JESUS CENTENO, ET AL., and THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. Nos. L-26894-96, February 28, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
In a previous decision (*NAWASA v. NWSA Consolidated Unions*, L-18938, August 31, 1964), the Supreme Court ruled that NAWASA employees were entitled to benefits under the Eight-Hour Labor Law and existing contractual obligations [1]. Following this, on May 12, 1965, the respondent Union filed a motion on behalf of three employees—Aurelio Zurbano (Corporate Legal Counsel), Francisco Domingo (Supervisor/Coordinating Engineer), and Rufo Fabregas (Chief, Administrative Division)—claiming they were similarly situated to the beneficiaries in the 1964 case and entitled to overtime and other benefits [2]. NAWASA opposed the claim, arguing that: (1) Domingo had retired in 1961, so the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) lacked jurisdiction due to the absence of an employer-employee relationship at the time of filing [3, 4]; (2) the employees were "managerial" and exempt from overtime pay [5]; (3) there was no written authorization for the overtime work [6]; and (4) the claims were barred by prescription [7]. The CIR granted the claims, awarding specific amounts to the employees. The CIR en banc affirmed the order [2]. NAWASA petitioned for review.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR has jurisdiction over the claim of an employee who had already retired at the time the motion was filed.
2. W/N the subject employees are "managerial employees" exempt from overtime benefits.
3. W/N the claims are barred by lack of written authorization or prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The CIR has jurisdiction. Although Domingo retired on October 11, 1961, and the motion was filed in 1965, the main labor dispute had been pending since 1957 [8]. Whatever rights Domingo could assert were in existence while the main case was being heard. The 1964 decision serves as the "law of the case," binding the parties [9, 10]. The lack of an employer-employee relationship at the exact moment of the specific motion's filing does not defeat jurisdiction when the right accrued during the pendency of the main case [10].

2. **NO.** The employees are not managerial. The CIR found that their primary duties did not bear a direct relation to management policies, nor did they have the power to hire or fire [5]. Crucially, they were required to observe official time, record their arrival and departure, and were subject to deductions for undertime, lacking the freedom of movement characteristic of managerial employees [5, 11]. The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's factual finding that they do not fall within the category of "managerial employees" [11].

3. **NO.** Regarding authorization, the Court found that Domingo had a directive, and while Zurbano and Fabregas lacked written authority, the record showed unrefuted evidence of verbal orders from the General Manager to perform overtime [12, 13]. Regarding prescription, the Court held that the claims were based not only on statute but on contractual obligations (CBA) affirmed by the "law of the case" in the 1964 decision [14]. The Court emphasized that doubts regarding their status were only clarified by the 1964 ruling, and equity demands they receive the benefits accorded to similarly situated employees [14, 15].

**Petition denied. Order affirmed.**
