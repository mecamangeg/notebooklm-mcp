I. CAPTION
THE MUNICIPALITY OF MALABANG AND AMER MACAORAO BALINDONG v. PANGANDAPUN BENITO, et al., G.R. No. L-28113, March 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 533, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Amer Macaorao Balindong is the mayor of the Municipality of Malabang, Lanao del Sur. Respondent Pangandapun Benito is the mayor of the Municipality of Balabagan, which was created on March 15, 1960, by Executive Order No. 386 issued by then President Carlos P. Garcia pursuant to Section 68 of the Revised Administrative Code [1].

Petitioners filed an original action for prohibition to nullify E.O. 386 and restrain respondents from performing their officials functions [2]. They relied on the ruling in *Pelaez v. Auditor General*, which declared Section 68 of the Administrative Code unconstitutional for constituting an undue delegation of legislative power to the President [2]. Respondents admitted the facts but argued that *Pelaez* should not apply because Balabagan is at least a *de facto* corporation, having been organized and functioning under a statute before it was declared unconstitutional, and thus its existence cannot be collaterally attacked [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipality of Balabagan is a *de facto* corporation despite the unconstitutionality of the Executive Order creating it.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that Balabagan is not a *de facto* corporation. For a municipality to be considered *de facto*, there must be some valid law giving corporate vitality to the organization [4]. An unconstitutional statute acts as no law at all; "it confers no rights; it imposes no duties; it affords no protection; it creates no office; it is, in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed" (*Norton v. Shelby County*) [5].

Since Section 68 of the Administrative Code was declared unconstitutional in *Pelaez*, and there is no other valid statute to give color of authority to Balabagan's creation, it cannot be a *de facto* corporation [4]. Consequently, its existence can be questioned even in a collateral proceeding [6].

However, the Court applied the **Operative Fact Doctrine**, citing *Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank*. While the executive order is void, its actual existence prior to the declaration of invalidity is an "operative fact" that cannot be ignored [5]. Therefore, acts done by the Municipality of Balabagan in the exercise of its corporate powers prior to this decision are not nullities [5].

The petition is **GRANTED**, Executive Order 386 is declared **VOID**, and respondents are permanently restrained from performing their duties [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Fernando, J. (Concurring):**
Agreed fully but wrote separately to emphasize the application of the "operative fact" doctrine to executive acts. He noted that judicial review exists to test executive and legislative acts, but realism dictates recognizing that between the enactment and the final declaration of nullity, the act exists as a fact and has consequences that "cannot justly be ignored" [8].
