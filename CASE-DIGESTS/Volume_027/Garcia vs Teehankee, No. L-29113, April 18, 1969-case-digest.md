**I. CAPTION**
PAZ M. GARCIA v. THE HON. SECRETARY OF JUSTICE CLAUDIO TEEHANKEE, FRANCISCO DE LA ROSA, and LORENZO C. STA ANA, G.R. No. L-29113, April 18, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Garcia, the Assistant Clerk of Court of the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Pasay City), was issued a directive on March 25, 1968, by respondent Secretary of Justice Teehankee [1-3]. The directive assigned her to work in the Stenographers' Section of the Department of Justice (DOJ) until further notice to finish transcribing all stenographic notes due from her in appealed cases [2, 4]. Garcia sought reconsideration, arguing the transfer was a disguised removal without cause and a demotion [4]. While she claimed to have submitted the transcripts, official records showed she had untranscribed notes in eight Court of Appeals cases and forty-two CFI cases [5, 6]. Instead of complying, she filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus with the Supreme Court to enjoin the directive [2, 7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the directive assigning Petitioner to the DOJ constitutes an illegal removal or demotion.
2. W/N the petition is barred by the failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the directive was a valid exercise of administrative powers justified by the needs of public service, particularly the speedy administration of justice [2, 8]. The assignment was on its face temporary and intended only to compel the transcription of notes [2, 8]. Furthermore, the directive did not reduce Petitioner's rank or salary. Under Section 32 of the Civil Service Act (R.A. 2260), a transfer from one position to another without reduction in rank or salary is not considered disciplinary when made in the interest of public service [9, 10].

2. **YES.** If Petitioner believed Section 32 of the Civil Service Act was inapplicable to her, her primary remedy was recourse to the Commissioner of Civil Service [11, 12]. Her failure to do so violated the time-honored principle that a party must first exhaust available administrative remedies before seeking judicial redress [11, 12].

Petition denied for lack of merit [1, 13].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Justices Teehankee and Barredo did not take part) [13].
