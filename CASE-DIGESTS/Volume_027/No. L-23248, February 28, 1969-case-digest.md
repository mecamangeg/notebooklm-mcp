I. CAPTION
MANUEL UY v. ENRICO PALOMAR, in his capacity as Postmaster General, G.R. No. L-23248, February 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 287, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Manuel Uy (petitioner-appellee), a duly authorized agent of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO), devised the "Grand Christmas Bonus Award" plan to boost ticket sales for the December 15, 1963 draw. Under the plan, purchasers of whole sweepstakes tickets sold by Uy's agency could win additional prizes (e.g., Volkswagen sedans, televisions) if their tickets won any of the major PCSO prizes. Participants paid nothing extra for the chance to win these bonuses; the prizes were funded solely from Uy's 10% agent commission [1], [2], [3], [4].

The Postmaster General, Enrico Palomar (respondent-appellant), issued Fraud Order No. 3, declaring the plan a lottery or gift enterprise prohibited by the Postal Law (Sections 1954, 1982, and 1983 of the Revised Administrative Code). He directed the closure of mail and money order services to Uy's agency [5], [6]. Uy filed a complaint for injunction with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI ruled in Uy's favor, declaring the fraud order contrary to law and making the injunction permanent [1]. Palomar appealed, arguing his findings of fact were conclusive and that the plan contained all elements of a lottery [7], [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the decision of the Postmaster General is subject to judicial review despite the absence of a specific statutory provision.
2. W/N the "Grand Christmas Bonus Award" plan constitutes a lottery or gift enterprise prohibited by the Postal Law.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The courts will interfere with the decision of the Postmaster General if it clearly appears that the decision is wrong or that he has exceeded his authority. The Supreme Court ruled that the silence of Congress regarding judicial review in the Postal Law does not preclude access to the courts (citing *American School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty*). The action of the Director of Posts is subject to revision by the courts when his act is palpably wrong [9], [10].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the plan was neither a lottery nor a prohibited gift enterprise because the essential element of **consideration** was missing. For a lottery to exist, three elements must concur: consideration, prize, and chance (*El Debate Inc. v. Topacio*) [11]. Here, participants did not pay any valuable consideration for the chance to win the bonus prizes; they only paid the authorized price of the sweepstakes ticket, which was the consideration for the PCSO draw, not Uy's bonus plan [12]. The Court applied the test that "consideration" requires a contribution to the fund from which prizes are paid; here, prizes came from Uy's own funds (agent's prize) [13], [4]. Consequently, the scheme was a gratuitous distribution of property by chance, which is not prohibited. The Fraud Order was declared contrary to law.

The decision of the Court of First Instance is **AFFIRMED** [14].
