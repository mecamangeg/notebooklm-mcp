I. CAPTION
PRECIOLITA V. CORLISS v. THE MANILA RAILROAD CO., G.R. No. L-21291, March 28, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On February 21, 1957, close to midnight, Ralph W. Corliss, Jr., a 21-year-old air police officer, was driving a jeep back to Clark Air Force Base with a P.C. soldier. Upon approaching the railroad crossing in Balibago, Angeles, Pampanga, the jeep collided with a locomotive operated by the Manila Railroad Company. The locomotive engineer, Teodorico Capili, testified that he had blown the siren and whistle from 300 meters away and applied the brakes, but the jeep suddenly spurted across the tracks. Ralph died of serious burns the next day. His widow, Preciolita V. Corliss, filed a suit for damages. The Court of First Instance of Pampanga dismissed the complaint, ruling that the deceased was the victim of his own miscalculation and that the defendant was not negligent. Preciolita appealed, arguing, among others, that the lack of crossing bars and guards at the gatehouse constituted negligence on the part of the railroad company.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Manila Railroad Company is liable for damages due to negligence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint. Under Article 2176 of the Civil Code, liability for damages is predicated on negligence, which is defined as the "want of the care required by the circumstances" [1, 2]. The Court upheld the factual findings that the locomotive engineer exercised due diligence by sounding warnings well in advance [3, 4].

The accident was caused by the victim's failure to exercise the necessary prudence. A railroad track is in itself a warning of danger, and it is incumbent upon a driver to approach it cautiously [5]. Citing *U.S. v. Manabat*, the Court held that a person in control of an automobile who crosses a railroad without exercising sufficient precaution to stop immediately is guilty of negligence [6]. Although the Court acknowledged that the standard of care depends on the peculiar circumstances of each case (citing *Pokora v. Wabash Railway*), the facts here showed the victim was sufficiently warned but took the risk to "beat" the train [4, 7, 8]. The failure to put down crossing bars did not absolve the victim of his duty to stop before the crossing [9].

The decision of the lower court dismissing the complaint is affirmed.
