I. CAPTION
ALFREDO B. BARAÑGAN v. VICENTE HERNANDO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-28652, February 28, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Barañgan was appointed acting chief of police of San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte by then-Mayor Madamba on July 17, 1961, and extended another appointment on July 1, 1963 [1]. On March 24, 1965, the Civil Service Commissioner approved the appointment subject to the condition that it would not extend beyond 30 days [1]. On April 30, 1965, the new Mayor, respondent Hernando, terminated Barañgan's services [2]. Barañgan refused to vacate, invoking his civil service eligibility obtained in 1963 [2]. The Commissioner subsequently issued indorsements "reapproving" Barañgan's appointment as provisional and then permanent, declaring his removal unlawful [2, 3]. Meanwhile, Mayor Hernando appointed respondent Damo as chief of police [2]. Barañgan filed for *quo warranto* and mandamus [4]. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Barañgan, ordering his reinstatement with back salaries, holding that the Commissioner's reclassification gave him permanent tenure [4]. Hernando appealed directly to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Civil Service Commissioner has the authority to change the nature of an appointment extended by the appointing power from temporary to provisional or permanent.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the determination of the class of appointment (permanent, provisional, or temporary) rests with the official vested by law with the appointing power (the Municipal Mayor), not the Civil Service Commissioner [5]. Under the Civil Service Law (R.A. 2260), the Commissioner is only empowered to approve or reject appointments based on compliance with statutory requirements [5]. The Commissioner's act of approving a temporary appointment as "provisional" constitutes an unwarranted invasion of the appointing officer's discretion and attempts to exercise the power of appointment lodged elsewhere [6].

The Court found Barañgan's appointment to be temporary in character, as evidenced by the Commissioner's initial approval limiting it to 30 days [7]. As a temporary appointee, Barañgan does not enjoy security of tenure and may be summarily removed at the pleasure of the appointing power, regardless of his civil service eligibility [8, 9]. The Court relied on the ruling in *Santos vs. Chico* [5].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is **reversed**, and the Commissioner of Civil Service is ordered to act on the appointment of appellant Damo [10].
