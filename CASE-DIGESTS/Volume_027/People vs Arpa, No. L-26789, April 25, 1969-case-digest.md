I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DICTO ARPA and MAALUM ARPA, G.R. No. L-26789, April 25, 1969, 27 SCRA 1037, Teehankee, J.

II. FACTS
On February 20, 1966, accused-appellants Dicto and Maalum Arpa boarded the motor banca "MAMI I" in Davao City bound for Talicud Island. When the vessel developed engine trouble in the middle of the sea, the accused executed their plan to steal the banca. Dicto fired his .22 caliber revolver to scare the passengers, wounding one of them. In fear, the three passengers—Alfonso, Bernardo, and Lourdes Villegas—jumped into the sea and drowned. The accused succeeded in taking the banca.

Charged with Robbery with Triple Homicide, the accused pleaded guilty but invoked the mitigating circumstance of "lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong," arguing their original design was only to rob. The trial court rejected this defense but appreciated their plea of guilty. However, it found two aggravating circumstances: (1) uninhabited place and (2) occasion of a misfortune (the engine trouble). Consequently, the trial court sentenced them to death. The case was automatically reviewed by the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the crime committed is Robbery with Triple Homicide even if the original intent was only to rob.
2. W/N the aggravating circumstance of uninhabited place is applicable.
3. W/N the aggravating circumstance of committing the crime on the "occasion of a misfortune" is applicable due to the engine trouble.
4. W/N the mitigating circumstance of lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong should be appreciated.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The crime is Robbery with Triple Homicide. Under Article 294, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code, the crime exists when homicide results by reason or on the occasion of the robbery. Even if the accused's original design did not comprehend homicide, the deaths clearly resulted by reason or on occasion of the robbery when the victims were forced to jump into the sea to escape the gunfire [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The crime was committed at sea, where it was difficult for the victims to receive help and the assailants could easily escape. The accused clearly sought the isolation of the sea to attain their criminal objective without interference, making the aggravating circumstance of uninhabited place applicable [3].

3. **NO.** The development of engine trouble at sea does not fall under "other calamity or misfortune" in Article 14, paragraph 7 of the Revised Penal Code. This provision refers to conditions of great distress similar to conflagration, shipwreck, earthquake, or epidemic. No such condition of great calamity existed that the accused took advantage of [4].

4. **NO.** This mitigating circumstance addresses the intention of the offender at the particular moment of execution, not the planning stage. By firing shots at the passengers and forcing them to jump overboard to their deaths, the accused committed acts where they cannot disclaim responsibility for the direct and logical consequences [5].

The decision of the lower court is **MODIFIED**. The aggravating circumstance of uninhabited place is offset by the mitigating circumstance of the plea of guilty. There being no other modifying circumstances, the penalty is reduced to *reclusion perpetua*. The accused are ordered to indemnify the heirs of the victims in the amount of P12,000.00 each [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
