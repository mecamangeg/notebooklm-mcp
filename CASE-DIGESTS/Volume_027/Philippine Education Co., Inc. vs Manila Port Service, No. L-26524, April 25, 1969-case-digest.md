I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE EDUCATION CO., INC. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE AND MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-26524, April 25, 1969, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Philippine Education Co., Inc. shipped 726 packages of books, magazines, and other merchandise from New York to Manila. Upon arrival on December 9, 1960, the shipment was discharged to the custody of the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service. Delivery to the consignee resulted in a shortage of 114 packages and missing contents from another package. The consignee filed provisional claims (stated in the stipulation of facts as filed December 15, 1960, though a typed date suggested September 1961) and a formal claim. When the demand was refused, the consignee filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against Manila Port Service and Manila Railroad Co. for P4,451.90 (principal value of lost goods) and P1,000.00 (attorney's fees), totaling P5,451.90. The CFI ruled in favor of the plaintiff, awarding the CIF value (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) of P3,989.19 plus attorney's fees. The defendants appealed, arguing lack of jurisdiction, untimely claim filing, and that liability should be limited to the invoice value rather than the CIF value.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction over the case.
2. W/N the provisional claim was timely filed.
3. W/N the arrastre operator is liable for the CIF value (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) of the lost goods.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of First Instance had jurisdiction. Under the law applicable at the time (RA 296, as amended by RA 2613), CFIs had original jurisdiction over cases where the demand, exclusive of interest, exceeded P5,000. In determining the jurisdictional amount, attorney's fees are included; only interest and costs are excluded. Since the plaintiff's total claim including attorney's fees was P5,451.90, the court properly assumed jurisdiction [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The claim was timely. Although the stipulation of facts contained a typed date of "September 4, 1961" alongside a handwritten date of "December 15, 1960" for the provisional claim, the appellants' counsel admitted the handwritten date by signing the stipulation without objection. Furthermore, it is logical that the provisional claim (December 1960) would precede the formal claim (May 1961), and the claim was filed within the same month the vessel discharged the cargo [3, 4].

3. **YES.** The arrastre operator is liable for the CIF value. Paragraph 15 of the management contract provides that the contractor is responsible for the invoice value "including all damages that may be suffered on account of loss, destruction or damage." The Court interpreted this provision to embrace not only the invoice cost but also actual damages suffered, such as freight and insurance charges paid in connection with the shipment [5, 6].

The judgment *a quo* is affirmed *in toto* [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
