I. CAPTION
WENCESLAO DESCUATAN v. SANCHO M. BALAYON, G.R. No. L-29865, February 28, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Descuatan filed a petition for *quo warranto* and prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cotabato, claiming he was legally entitled to the office of Municipal Mayor of Norala, South Cotabato [1]. This claim arose after both the incumbent Mayor and Vice-Mayor filed their certificates of candidacy on September 15, 1967, which resulted in their considered resignation under the election laws [2]. Descuatan, a councilor, argued he was the rightful successor under Section 7 of the Local Autonomy Act [2]. He sought to recover the salary for the period of September 21, 1967, to December 31, 1967, as well as P50,000.00 in damages [1].

The CFI dismissed the petition on April 1, 1968 [1]. Descuatan appealed to the Supreme Court. During the pendency of the appeal, the term of office in dispute expired on December 31, 1967 [2]. The Supreme Court initially issued a resolution asking why the appeal should not be dismissed as moot and academic [3]. Descuatan argued that the case was not moot because his claim for salaries and damages remained pending [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for *quo warranto* should be dismissed as moot and academic due to the expiration of the term of office, despite a pending claim for salaries and damages.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the dismissal was improper. Relying on *Monroy v. Court of Appeals* (20 SCRA 620), the Court ruled that in a *quo warranto* proceeding involving the forfeiture of an office, the matter of who is entitled to the salary during the disputed period may still be inquired into, even if the right to the office itself has become moot due to the expiration of the term [4].

Since the Petitioner sought the recovery of salaries and damages he alleged he would have received had he not been precluded from assuming office, the lower court should have considered the merits of the case regarding these claims [5]. A rightful incumbent is entitled to recover the salary received by a *de facto* officer [6].

The Order of dismissal was **REVERSED** and the case was **REMANDED** to the lower court for disposition [7].
