I. CAPTION
CARMEN DEVEZA, DOROTEA CABRERA and FELINO CABRERA v. HON. JUAN B. MONTECILLO and PATERNO CHUMACERA, G.R. No. L-23942, March 28, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Deveza et al., owners of a titled riceland in Tiaong, Quezon, discovered during a relocation survey on June 16, 1959, that respondent Chumacera was occupying approximately 3,000 square meters of their property [1]. On February 5, 1960, petitioners filed a complaint labeled "Unlawful Detainer" in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Tiaong, alleging that Chumacera had been occupying the portion "knowingly or unknowingly" [1, 2]. Chumacera moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, claiming he and his predecessors had possessed the land in the concept of owner for 60 years [3]. The JP Court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction [4]. Petitioners filed a petition for Mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon to compel the JP to hear the case [4]. The CFI dismissed the Mandamus petition, ruling the JP acted properly [5]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the municipal court (Justice of the Peace) has jurisdiction over the complaint filed by petitioners.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of the lower court [6].

For a municipal court to have jurisdiction under Rule 70, the complaint must satisfy specific requirements which are interpreted *strictissimi juris* [7]. First, the complaint failed to aver facts constituting **forcible entry** (deprivation by force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth) or **unlawful detainer** (withholding possession after the expiration of a contract) [7]. The allegation that respondent occupied the land "knowingly or unknowingly" does not fit these definitions [7].

Second, the one-year period to file the action is jurisdictional and counts from the unlawful deprivation [8]. The complaint was silent on when possession started, and petitioners admitted during oral arguments that respondent had been in possession for more than one year prior to filing the complaint [9, 10]. Consequently, the summary remedy under Rule 70 is inapplicable as the situation requires a full-blown inquiry into ownership or the better right to possession, which is beyond the municipal court's jurisdiction [11, 12].
