**I. CAPTION**
LUCIANO AZUR and NICOLAS BULALACAO v. THE PROVINCIAL BOARD, THE PROVINCIAL TREASURER, THE PROVINCIAL AUDITOR, and THE PROVINCIAL WARDEN, CAMARINES SUR, G.R. No. L-22333, February 27, 1969, Barredo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners Azur and Bulalacao were provincial guards in Camarines Sur who had been holding their positions continuously for more than five years [1]. On January 15, 1960, they were notified that their positions had been abolished by Provincial Board Resolution No. 16 (later amended by Resolution No. 45) ostensibly for "economy" [1, 2]. Petitioners alleged that the abolition was a sham committed in bad faith to replace them with political appointees, as new guards were hired shortly after [2]. They took the qualifying examination on February 27, 1960 [1].

They filed a complaint for reinstatement and damages in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Sur [1]. The respondents filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground that the complaint stated no cause of action, arguing that petitioners were temporary employees terminable at pleasure and that the abolition was legal [3]. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that as temporary employees, their tenure expired every three months or was terminable at pleasure, and thus they had no right to reinstatement [4, 5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the complaint states a valid cause of action despite the petitioners' status as temporary employees.
2. W/N the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies applies.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the complaint stated a sufficient cause of action. Under **Section 23 of the Civil Service Law (R.A. 2260)**, non-eligible employees who have rendered five years or more of continuous service have a preferential right to hold their positions [6]. They cannot be removed unless: (1) they fail the qualifying examination given within one year; or (2) they are replaced by civil service eligibles [6, 7]. Since the complaint alleged that petitioners served for over five years and were not replaced by eligibles, they acquired a right to continue in office [7, 8]. Furthermore, while the power to abolish an office is inherent, it is subject to the limitation that it must be exercised in **good faith** [9, 10]. The allegation that the abolition was for political reasons and not genuine economy, if true, renders the abolition illegal [11]. The trial court erred in dismissing the case based on the assumption that temporary appointments are always terminable at pleasure, disregarding the statutory protection for long-serving employees [7].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies is not absolute and admits of exceptions [12]. One such exception is when the controverted act is **patently illegal** [12]. Admitting the truth of the petitioners' allegations that they were separated in violation of the Civil Service Law and that the abolition of their positions was in bad faith, immediate recourse to the courts was justified [12].

**Disposition:** The orders of the trial court are set aside, and the case is remanded for further proceedings [13].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Concepcion, Reyes, Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Fernando, Capistrano, and Teehankee concurred [14].
