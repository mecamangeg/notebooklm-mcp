**I. CAPTION**
ARACELI V. MALAG v. RAMON DE LOS CIENTOS, G.R. No. L-29684, March 28, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Araceli Malag, the elected Mayor of Magsaysay, Davao, faced administrative charges for serious misconduct filed by a barrio captain in June 1968. Respondent Provincial Governor Ramon de los Cientos required her to answer the charges and subsequently issued an order on July 3, 1968, preventively suspending her from office and directing the Vice-Mayor to assume her post. Malag filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao to stop the enforcement of the suspension, arguing the order lacked legal basis. Although the CFI initially issued a preliminary injunction, it later granted the Governor's motion to dismiss on September 10, 1968, declaring the suspension valid and dissolving the injunction. Malag appealed to the Supreme Court. [2, 3]

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Provincial Governor has the power to preventively suspend a municipal mayor under the Decentralization Act of 1967. [3, 4]

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Provincial Governor lacks the authority to preventively suspend a municipal official. Citing the precedent established in *Sarcos v. Governor Castillo* (G.R. No. L-29755), the Court ruled that upon the effectivity of the Decentralization Act of 1967 (Republic Act No. 5185), the power of preventive suspension was removed from the Provincial Governor and exclusively lodged in the Provincial Board. Consequently, the respondent Governor's order suspending Mayor Malag and installing the Vice-Mayor was declared null and void for being contrary to law.

The order of the Court of First Instance of Davao was **REVERSED and SET ASIDE**, and the respondents were prohibited from enforcing the suspension order. [3-5]
