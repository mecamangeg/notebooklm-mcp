I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF RAMON HONG CHIONG YU alias RAMON L. YOUNG TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. RAMON HONG CHIONG YU alias RAMON L. YOUNG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20895, February 28, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Ramon Hong Chiong Yu, born of Chinese parents in Capiz in 1934, filed a petition for naturalization on October 13, 1959. At the time of the hearing, he was a resident of Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro, and a fourth-year chemical engineering student in Manila. In his petition, he alleged an annual income of P1,800.00 (or P150.00 monthly) as a salesman at the Globe Bicycle Store [1]. The Court of First Instance of Oriental Mindoro granted his petition, finding that he received an additional P100.00 monthly from a tutorial class, raising his total monthly income to P250.00 [2, 3]. The Solicitor General appealed the decision, arguing that the petitioner failed to meet the lucrative income requirement under the Naturalization Law, among other errors [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's monthly income of P250.00 satisfies the statutory requirement of a lucrative occupation or calling.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, ruling that the petitioner's income was insufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Naturalization Law. The Court held that an annual income of P1,800.00 (P150.00 monthly) is not lucrative [2]. Furthermore, even accepting the lower court's finding that the petitioner earned an additional P100.00 from tutorial classes for a total of P250.00 monthly, this amount still fails to meet the statutory standard [5]. The Court relied on established jurisprudence, noting that even a monthly income of P300.00 has been held insufficient (*Sia Faw vs. Republic*) [2, 5].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the petition is **DENIED** [6].
