I. CAPTION
SAN ILDEFONSO ELECTRIC PLANT, INC. v. BALIUAG ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER CO., INC. and THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, Nos. L-26770 & L-26771, March 25, 1969, 27 SCRA 404, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner San Ildefonso Electric Plant and private respondent Baliuag Electric Light both sought a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) to operate an electric plant in San Ildefonso, Bulacan. Petitioner was granted a municipal franchise in 1958 but failed to secure Provincial Board approval until 1961 and did not file its CPC application until September 1962. During the proceedings, Petitioner postponed hearings six times, showing a lack of interest. In contrast, Respondent obtained its franchise in April 1964 and filed its application within two months. Respondent was already successfully operating in neighboring towns. The Municipal Council of San Ildefonso eventually revoked Petitioner's franchise and granted one to Respondent. The Public Service Commission (PSC) denied Petitioner's application and granted the CPC to Respondent based on superior capability and public interest. Petitioner appealed, claiming priority in filing and challenging the validity of the revocation of its franchise.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N priority in the filing of the application is the controlling factor in granting a Certificate of Public Convenience.
2. W/N the Public Service Commission has the authority to annul a municipal resolution revoking a franchise.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Priority in filing is not controlling. While priority is an element to be considered, it is not of sufficient importance to control the grant of a CPC when there are various applications. The PSC is authorized to determine which applicant can best meet the requirements of public convenience (*De los Santos v. Pasay Transportation Co.*). Petitioner demonstrated negligence and a lackadaisical attitude through years of inaction and repeated postponements. Respondent, an experienced operator in neighboring municipalities, demonstrated efficiency and "know-how." Public interest is the paramount consideration, and Respondent was in a better position to promote it (*Mindanao Bus Co. v. Cagayan-Misamis Land Transportation Co.*).

2. **NO.** The Commission has no authority to annul a municipal resolution revoking a franchise; such power belongs to the ordinary courts of justice (*Batangas Laguna Tayabas Bus v. Public Service Commission*). Moreover, even if Petitioner’s franchise had not been revoked, the PSC was fully justified in denying its application and granting the certificate to Respondent based on the comparison of their past conduct and capability to serve the public.

**Decision affirmed.**
