I. CAPTION
NATIONAL MIRROR FACTORY v. ISIDRA SUNGA VDA. DE ANURE, ET AL., and WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-22007, March 28, 1969, Castro, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Juan Anure, a driver-laborer for the petitioner, died of acute cardiac failure on February 14, 1958, shortly after changing a flat tire on a delivery truck per his manager's order [2]. His widow, respondent Isidra, received P700.00 from the petitioner and executed an affidavit stating her husband died of natural causes and waiving any claims against the company [3]. On October 23, 1961, over three years later, she filed a claim for death benefits [3]. The hearing officer dismissed the case, but the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed this, awarding death benefits and burial expenses [3, 4]. During the appeal to the Supreme Court, a motion to dismiss was filed, alleging the petitioner had fully paid the award to the satisfaction of the claimant, though this settlement was not approved by the Commissioner [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the joint motion to dismiss the appeal based on an amicable settlement should be granted.
2. W/N the Workmen’s Compensation Commission lacked jurisdiction because the claim was filed beyond the three-month statutory period.
3. W/N the claimant is estopped from recovering benefits due to her affidavit of waiver.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** An agreement modifying the WCC’s award is invalid without the approval of the Workmen’s Compensation Commissioner. Under Section 29 of Act 3428, two requisites are necessary for a compensation agreement to be valid: the amount must be at least equal to that provided by the Act, and it must be approved by the Commissioner [6, 7]. The law protects workers from "dubious agreements" and condemns as nullities any scheme to exempt the employer from liability under Section 7 of the Act [8, 9]. Since prior approval was not secured, the agreement is invalid and cannot be invoked to dismiss the appeal [10].

2. **NO.** The filing of a claim beyond the three-month period in Section 24 is a non-jurisdictional defect [11]. The petitioner failed to controvert the claim within the ten-day period prescribed by law, which bars it from asserting that the claim was filed out of time [11, 12]. Additionally, the P700.00 payment was considered partial compensation, which excuses late filing under Section 25 of the Act [11].

3. **NO.** The affidavit executed by the widow is a nullity under Section 7 of Act 3428, which provides that "Any contract, regulation or device of any sort intended to exempt the employer from all or part of the liability created by this Act shall be null and void" [13]. Being void, the affidavit is inefficacious to prove estoppel [13].

ACCORDINGLY, the decision appealed from is affirmed *in toto*, with costs against the petitioner [14].
