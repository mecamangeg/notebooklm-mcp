I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ANASTACIO MAISUG, ET AL. (HERMINIGILDO TADO, Appellant), G.R. No. L-22187, March 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 742, Barredo, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of February 17, 1962, in Mandawe, Cebu, appellant Herminigildo Tado acted as the banker and dealer in a card game called "pares-pares." Regino Gala, a player who had lost money, tore a playing card in disgust. This angered Tado. Suddenly, co-accused Anastacio Maisug stabbed Gala from behind, resulting in Gala's death. Maisug surrendered and executed an extrajudicial confession implicating Tado, alleging that Tado had instructed him to stab anyone causing trouble and had given him a "signal" to attack Gala.

Based on this confession and the testimony of prosecution witness Alberto Balle, who claimed to have seen the signal, the trial court convicted Tado of murder as a principal by induction. Maisug pleaded guilty and was convicted separately. Tado appealed, arguing there was no proof of conspiracy or inducement.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N appellant Tado is guilty of murder as a principal by induction based on the alleged conspiracy and signal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court acquitted Tado on the ground of reasonable doubt. The Court ruled that the evidence was insufficient to establish conspiracy or inducement. The conviction by the trial court relied heavily on Maisug's extrajudicial confession and Balle's testimony regarding a "signal." However, Maisug repudiated the confession in open court. The Court held that since Maisug was an unschooled farmer who could not read, his English confession—translated multiple times—was "pregnant with possibilities of human... inadequacies," making it unsafe as a basis for conviction without sufficient corroboration.

Furthermore, the Court found the testimony of witness Balle regarding the "signal" to be vague and incredible, noting that Balle did not mention any signal in his initial police affidavit and only revealed it during the trial. The Court emphasized that a moral conviction of guilt must be the "logical and inevitable result of the evidence on record," and mere vague testimony about a signal constitutes a conviction based on inference, which is impermissible. Tado was ordered released.
