I. CAPTION
JULIANA B. BRILLANTES v. MARIANO R. GUEVARRA, G.R. No. L-22586, February 27, 1969, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Brillantes was a Principal assigned to Sinalang Elementary School in Bangued, Abra. Her appointment was as "Principal (Elementary School) in the Bureau of Public Schools" without mention of a specific station [1, 2]. Respondent Guevarra, the Division Superintendent, issued a directive transferring her to Peñarrubia Elementary School, citing a Department of Education policy requiring transfers of principals after five years in a station [3].

Brillantes objected, arguing the transfer was unconsented, disciplinary in nature, and a demotion because Sinalang was a pilot school with 23 teachers while Peñarrubia was a non-pilot school with only 13 teachers [4, 5]. She filed a complaint for "Declaration of Nullity, Injunction and Damages" in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Abra, claiming violation of her security of tenure [6]. The CFI dismissed her complaint [6].

Pending her appeal to the Supreme Court, Brillantes refused to transfer. Consequently, the Commissioner of Civil Service charged her with insubordination and administratively suspended her for ten months [7]. She petitioned the Supreme Court to nullify this administrative sanction [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the unconsented transfer of the petitioner violated her constitutional security of tenure.
2. W/N the administrative suspension for insubordination imposed pending appeal was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that security of tenure depends on the nature of the appointment. Since Brillantes' appointment was as Principal "in the Bureau of Public Schools" and did not specify a particular station, her security of tenure covered only the position, not the station [2, 9]. She may be assigned to any station as the exigency of public service requires [2]. The Court further ruled there was no demotion because both schools fell under the classification for "Principal I" (schools with less than 25 teachers), and she retained the same rank and salary [10, 11].

2. **NO.** The Court nullified the administrative suspension. While the transfer order was valid, the Court held that school authorities should be cautious in charging teachers with insubordination for non-compliance with directives that are subject to pending judicial appeal [12]. Brillantes acted in good faith, believing her refusal was legally defensible, and penalizing her pending final resolution would deter judicial recourse [13, 14].

Accordingly, the decision of the CFI affirming the transfer is **AFFIRMED**, but the decision of the Commissioner of Civil Service suspending the petitioner is declared **NULL AND VOID** [15].
