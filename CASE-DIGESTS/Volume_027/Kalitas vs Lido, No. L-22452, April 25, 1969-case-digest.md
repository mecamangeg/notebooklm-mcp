I. CAPTION
GEORGE KALITAS v. CATALINO LIDO and HON. JUDGE VICENTE CUSI, JR., G.R. No. L-22452, April 25, 1969, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner George Kalitas filed a suit in the Court of First Instance of Davao to recover possession of a portion of land in Mati, Davao from his brother, respondent Catalino Lido [1]. Lido claimed ownership based on a public instrument where Kalitas acknowledged Lido's rights [1]. The parties submitted a Stipulation of Facts, which included a clause reserving the right to present "additional evidence as may be necessary" [2]. The trial court rendered judgment dismissing the complaint and recognizing Lido's ownership [3].

Kalitas received the decision on November 7, 1963 [2]. On December 4, 1963, he filed a motion for new trial, invoking the reservation clause to present evidence that the instrument did not express his true intention [2]. The court denied the motion on December 14, 1963, and Kalitas received the denial the same day [4]. He filed a notice of appeal on December 16, 1963, but did not submit his record on appeal until January 7, 1964 [4]. The trial court dismissed the appeal for being filed out of time [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in denying the motion for new trial based on the reservation clause in the Stipulation of Facts.
2. W/N the petitioner’s appeal was perfected on time.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The right to present evidence in addition to an agreed statement of facts must be invoked before the case is submitted to the court for decision [5]. Petitioner did not offer to present evidence during the trial, nor did he claim that his failure to do so was due to fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable neglect, or that the evidence was newly discovered under Rule 37, Sec. 1 [5]. The reservation clause cannot be used to reopen a case after judgment has been rendered without meeting these requirements [5].

2. **NO.** The appeal was filed late. Under Rule 41, the time during which a motion for new trial is pending is deducted from the 30-day appeal period [6]. Petitioner received the decision on November 7, 1963, and filed his motion on December 4, 1963, using up 27 days [6]. When he received the denial on December 14, 1963, he had only three days left, or until December 17, 1963, to perfect his appeal [6]. Since the record on appeal was submitted only on January 7, 1964, the judgment had already become final and executory [6].

Petition denied [7].
