I. CAPTION
PAZ ONGSIACO and the HEIRS OF THE LATE AUGUSTO ONGSIACO v. ROMAN D. DALLO, et al., G.R. No. L-27451, February 28, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In 1966, respondents Roman D. Dallo, et al. filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija (Civil Case No. 113-G) against petitioners Paz Ongsiaco, et al. for the ownership and possession of a 255-hectare parcel of land in Cuyapo, Nueva Ecija [1, 2]. Respondents alleged that their predecessors-in-interest had possessed the land since time immemorial but were displaced in 1924 when petitioners moved boundary monuments during a cadastral survey [3, 4]. Respondents admitted in their pleadings that petitioners had been in actual possession of the disputed land since 1924, albeit allegedly in bad faith [4, 5]. Petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss on grounds including prescription and res judicata [6]. The trial court denied the motion, ruling on res judicata but failing to resolve the issue of prescription [7]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari to set aside the trial court's orders [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for recovery of ownership and possession is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the respondents' claim had prescribed. It was admitted that petitioners had been in adverse possession of the land for 42 years (since 1924) before the complaint was filed in 1966 [5]. Under the Code of Civil Procedure (Act No. 190), which applies to this case pursuant to Article 1116 of the Civil Code, good or bad faith is immaterial for acquisitive prescription; adverse possession in either character ripens into ownership after ten (10) years [5, 8]. Similarly, Section 40 of Act No. 190 provides that an action to recover title to or possession of immovable property prescribes in ten years [5]. Even if the thirty-year period for extraordinary prescription or the extinction of real actions under the New Civil Code were applied, the period had already expired when the action was filed [8]. The trial court's failure to resolve the decisive issue of prescription constituted grave abuse of discretion [3].

Petition granted; orders set aside and complaint dismissed [9].
