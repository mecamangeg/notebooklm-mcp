I. CAPTION
MANUEL C. CASTAÑEDA, as Chairman of the Land Tenure Administration, et al. v. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, et al., G.R. No. L-25874, February 28, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
The government acquired the Baclaran Estate for resale to tenants under Commonwealth Act No. 539. Mariano Vizcarra was the lessee of Lot 21-B. His daughter, respondent Juanita Vizcarra, applied for the purchase of Lot 13-A (148 sq. m.) and executed an agreement to sell with the Rural Progress Administration in 1948, paying the price in full. However, no final deed of sale was executed. In 1954, Simplicio Almando (substituted by his heirs) protested, claiming he was the actual occupant of Lot 13-A.

The Land Tenure Administration (LTA) investigated and found that Almando was the actual occupant who had declared the house thereon for taxation since 1945, while Juanita never occupied the lot. The LTA further found that Lot 13-A was never part of the lot leased to Mariano. Consequently, the LTA cancelled Juanita’s agreement and ruled that Almando had the preferential right to purchase. This was affirmed by the Office of the President and the Court of First Instance. However, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the decision, ruling that Almando was not a *bona fide* occupant because his stay was merely "tolerated" by Mariano Vizcarra.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Simplicio Almando, as the actual occupant, has the preferential right to purchase the lot over Juanita Vizcarra.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CA and reinstated the CFI decision. The Court held that the findings of fact of administrative bodies like the LTA—specifically that Almando was the actual occupant and Lot 13-A was not part of the lot leased to Mariano—are binding on the courts in the absence of fraud, imposition, or mistake [1].

The Court rejected the CA's conclusion that Almando acted in bad faith or by mere tolerance. Since Lot 13-A was not part of the lot leased to Mariano, Mariano had no right to "tolerate" Almando’s occupancy, and they were, at most, on equal footing, with Almando having the advantage of actual possession [2, 3]. Under Commonwealth Act No. 539, the actual occupant is entitled to priority. Furthermore, regulations granting privileges to children of tenants must be understood without prejudice to the better rights of actual occupants; Juanita, having never been a lessee nor an occupant, had no right to displace Almando [4].

Petition granted. Decision of the Court of Appeals reversed; decision of the Court of First Instance affirmed.
