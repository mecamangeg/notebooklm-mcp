I. CAPTION
CONSOLIDATED WORKERS UNION v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25333, March 28, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Coto Labor Union (CLU) filed a complaint for unfair labor practice against Benguet Consolidated, Inc. and petitioner Consolidated Workers Union (CWU). CLU alleged that the company interfered with its union elections and, in violation of their collective bargaining agreement (CBA), turned over union dues to CWU to discourage CLU membership [1, 2]. CLU prayed that CWU be disestablished as a company-dominated union [3]. Pending the case, CLU filed a motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin the company and CWU from negotiating a new CBA and to deposit all collected union dues in court [3].

CWU opposed, claiming it was the successor of CLU following the cancellation of CLU’s registration and had signed a new CBA with the company [4, 5]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ordered CWU to deposit the union dues it received from the company in court but did not require CLU to post a bond for the injunction [6, 7]. CWU appealed, arguing the order deprived it of property without due process and erred in failing to require a bond [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR order to deposit union dues deprived CWU of property without due process.
2. W/N the posting of a bond is a condition precedent for the issuance of the preliminary injunction.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The order did not deprive CWU of property without due process because the argument assumes the dues are undisputedly CWU's property, which is the precise issue in the main case [8, 9]. If the CIR ultimately finds CWU to be company-dominated, CWU would have no authority to represent the workers and would have to return the dues [8, 9]. Because the moneys might be improperly spent before a final disestablishment order is made, it was logical and reasonable for the court to order the deposit to preserve the funds [8, 9].

2. **YES.** The posting of a bond under Section 4 of Rule 58 of the Rules of Court is a condition *sine qua non* for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction (*Siva v. Reyes*, 83 Phil. 416; *Villarosa v. Teodoro*, 100 Phil. 24) [7, 10, 11]. It was error for the labor court not to require the bond. However, this error did not cause substantial prejudice warranting reversal of the entire order [12].

The Order is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that a bond, in an amount determined by the lower court, be posted for the maintenance of the injunctive writ [12].
