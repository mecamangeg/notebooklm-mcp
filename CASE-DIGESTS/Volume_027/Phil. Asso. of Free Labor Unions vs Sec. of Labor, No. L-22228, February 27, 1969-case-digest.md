I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE ASSOCIATION OF FREE LABOR UNIONS (PAFLU), SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION-PAFLU, et al. v. THE SECRETARY OF LABOR, THE DIRECTOR OF LABOR RELATIONS, and THE REGISTRAR OF LABOR ORGANIZATIONS, G.R. No. L-22228, February 27, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On September 25, 1963, the Registrar of Labor Organizations issued a notice of hearing regarding the cancellation of the Social Security System Employees Association's (SSSEA) registration certificate [1]. The cancellation was based on the union's alleged failure to submit financial reports and non-subversive affidavits of its officers, in violation of Section 23 of Republic Act No. 875 [1, 2]. On October 23, 1963, the Registrar rendered a decision cancelling the registration [3]. SSSEA President Alfredo Fajardo filed a motion for reconsideration, but while it was pending resolution, the petitioners (PAFLU and SSSEA) filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition [3, 4]. They alleged that Section 23 of R.A. 875 is unconstitutional for violating freedom of assembly and association, and that the Registrar acted without jurisdiction by rendering the decision beyond the 30-day period prescribed by law [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Section 23 of Republic Act No. 875 violates the constitutional freedom of assembly and association.
2. W/N the Registrar's decision to cancel the registration is void for being rendered beyond the statutory period.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the theory that Section 23 unduly curtails freedom of assembly is devoid of factual basis [5]. The registration prescribed is not a limitation on the right of assembly or association, which may be exercised with or without said registration [5]. Rather, registration is merely a condition *sine qua non* for the acquisition of legal personality and the possession of rights and privileges granted by law to legitimate labor organizations [5]. These rights are statutory creations, not constitutional guarantees, and the registration requirement is a valid exercise of police power to protect both labor and the public against abuses, fraud, or impostors [5]. The requirement to submit financial statements is a reasonable regulation for the benefit of union members [5].

2. **NO.** The 30-day period invoked by petitioners applies to proceedings for *registration* under Section 23(c), not to *cancellation* proceedings which are governed by Section 23(d) [6]. Furthermore, statutes specifying a time for public officers to act are generally directory, not mandatory, unless time is of the essence or the statute implies a limitation of power [7, 8]. Consequently, a judgment promulgated after the expiration of such a period is not null and void [7]. The Court also noted that the petition was premature and failed to exhaust administrative remedies, as the motion for reconsideration was still pending and no appeal had been made to the Secretary of Labor [8].

**Petition dismissed and writs prayed for denied.**
