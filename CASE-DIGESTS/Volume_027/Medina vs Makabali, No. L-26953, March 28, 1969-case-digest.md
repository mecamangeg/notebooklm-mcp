I. CAPTION
ZENAIDA MEDINA, assisted by her husband, FELICIANO CASERO v. DRA. VENANCIA L. MAKABALI, G.R. No. L-26953, March 28, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On February 4, 1961, petitioner Zenaida Medina gave birth to a son, Joseph Casero, at the clinic of respondent Dr. Venancia Makabali. Joseph was Zenaida's third child with Feliciano Casero, a married man. Zenaida left the child with Dr. Makabali immediately after birth. The respondent raised Joseph as her own son, funding his medical treatment for poliomyelitis and his education. From Joseph's birth until August 1966, Zenaida never visited the child nor contributed to his support. Zenaida lived in an irregular *menage a trois* arrangement with Feliciano Casero and his legal wife.

Zenaida filed a petition for *habeas corpus* in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga (Special Proceeding No. 1947) to recover custody of Joseph. During the trial, the child, then over five years old, did not recognize Zenaida and explicitly chose to stay with the respondent, whom he called "Mammy." The trial court denied the writ, ruling against Zenaida. She appealed directly to the Supreme Court on points of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner, as the biological mother, is entitled to the custody of the minor child despite having abandoned him.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the lower court's order denying custody to the petitioner.

While the law generally recognizes a parent's right to custody, the **welfare of the child is paramount** (Civil Code, Art. 363) [1, 2]. The Court held that for compelling reasons, even a child under seven may be separated from the mother [1, 2]. Parental authority is not a power over the child but a "sacred trust for the welfare of the minor" [1, 2].

The right to custody is merely ancillary to the discharge of parental duties, such as providing support, education, and care (Civil Code, Art. 356) [3-5]. The petitioner was remiss in these duties, having deserted the child and failed to visit him during his tender years [3-5]. The Court found no benefit in coercing the child to abandon the respondent's love and care to live in the petitioner's irregular *menage a trois* environment [5, 6].

The Order of the Court of First Instance of Pampanga is AFFIRMED [7].
