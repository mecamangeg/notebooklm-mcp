I. CAPTION
LUIS G. DE CASTRO v. JULIAN G. GINETE and UBALDO Y. ARCANGEL, G.R. No. L-30058, March 28, 1969, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner De Castro and respondent Ginete were candidates for Municipal Mayor of Bulan, Sorsogon in the November 14, 1967 elections. On January 1, 1968, the Board of Canvassers proclaimed De Castro the winner by a margin of 12 votes [1]. Subsequently, Ginete sent a congratulatory note to De Castro, attended the inauguration, and delivered a speech urging the public to cooperate with the new administration [2]. However, on January 8, 1968, Ginete filed an election protest alleging frauds and irregularities [3]. De Castro filed a motion to dismiss (captioned "Manifestation and Motion"), arguing that Ginete was estopped from protesting due to his concessions and public recognition of De Castro's victory, and that the protest failed to state a cause of action [3]. The Court of First Instance denied the motion and the subsequent reconsideration [3]. De Castro filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N respondent Ginete is estopped from filing an election protest due to his congratulatory acts and participation in the inauguration.
2. W/N the election protest should be dismissed for failure to specifically allege that correcting the irregularities would change the result.

IV. RULING
**1. NO.** The Supreme Court held that Ginete's acts were merely "laudable gesture[s] of sportsmanship" and a manifestation of respect for the proclamation, not an admission that the election was free from irregularities [5]. The elements of estoppel under Rule 131, Section 3(a) of the Rules of Court were not present because Ginete did not intentionally mislead De Castro, nor did De Castro assume office in reliance on Ginete's acts; De Castro assumed office by operation of law based on the proclamation [6, 7]. Furthermore, an election contest involves public interest, and a losing candidate's recognition of the proclaimed winner does not bar them from questioning the validity of the election in the manner provided by law [8]. Estoppel is generally only applicable in election cases where candidates voluntarily submit to a drawing of lots to break a tie [9].

**2. NO.** The Court ruled that it would be an "undue recourse to technicality" to dismiss the protest [10]. Although the protest did not explicitly state that the result would change, it alleged specific frauds (such as vote-buying and misrepresentation of voters) which, if proven, would mathematically overcome the 12-vote margin [10, 11]. Statutes providing for election contests must be liberally construed to ensure the will of the people is not defeated by formal or technical objections [10].

The petition was **dismissed** [12].
