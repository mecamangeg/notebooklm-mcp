I. CAPTION
STERLING PRODUCTS INTERNATIONAL, INCORPORATED v. FARBENFABRIKEN BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT and ALLIED MANUFACTURING & TRADING CO., INC., G.R. No. L-19906, April 30, 1969, 27 SCRA 1214, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
The dispute involves the use of the trademarks "BAYER" and "BAYER CROSS IN CIRCLE" in the Philippines.

Friedrich Bayer organized a drug company in Germany (Bayer Germany), which originally owned these trademarks. Its subsidiary, Bayer Co., Inc. of New York (Bayer New York), was seized by the US Alien Property Custodian during WWI and sold to Sterling Drug, Inc., the parent company of petitioner Sterling Products International (SPI) [1-3]. SPI, a US corporation, registered the trademarks in the Philippines in 1939 and 1948, but only for "medicines" (Class 6) [4, 5]. SPI marketed Aspirin and Cafiaspirina using these marks [6].

Respondent Farbenfabriken Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (FBA), the successor of the original German company, sought to register the same trademarks in the Philippines for "industrial and agricultural products" (insecticides and chemicals). In 1958, FBA’s distributor, Allied Manufacturing & Trading Co. (AMATCO), began selling "Folidol" (an insecticide) bearing the Bayer Cross mark [7]. FBA obtained a registration in the Supplemental Register for these goods in 1960 [8].

SPI sued FBA and AMATCO for infringement and unfair competition, seeking to exclude them from using the marks. FBA countersued to cancel SPI's registration for medicines, claiming FBA was the original owner [9].

The trial court dismissed both the complaint and counterclaim, ruling that SPI could keep the marks for medicines and FBA could use them for chemicals/insecticides, provided FBA added a distinctive word indicating the products came from Germany [10, 11]. Both parties appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N SPI is entitled to trademark protection against FBA’s use of the "BAYER" marks on non-medicinal products (insecticides/chemicals).
2. W/N SPI's registration should be cancelled due to FBA's prior use/ownership claim.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that SPI's right to the trademarks is limited to the goods actually used in commerce and specified in its registration—namely, medicines. Under the Trademark Law (R.A. 166), actual use in commerce is a prerequisite to ownership [12]. Registration is merely declaratory of a pre-existing right growing out of use [13]. Section 11 requires the certificate to state the "particular goods" for which it is registered; SPI's registration covered only medicines [14].

The Court distinguished this from *Ang v. Teodoro* (confusion of origin rule). While *Ang* protected a trademark owner against non-competing goods if confusion of origin was likely, the equities here differed [15, 16]. The Court found that SPI was not the originator of the mark but had "ridden on the German reputation" of the Bayer name [17]. Representations on SPI's product packaging (e.g., "Used since 1900") were misleading because they implied a connection to the original German source [18]. Since SPI marketed its goods by capitalizing on the goodwill established by FBA's predecessor, it could not invoke equity to exclude FBA from using the marks on different products [19, 20]. The principle of territoriality also meant SPI's US registration for insecticides did not extend protection to the Philippines [21].

2. **NO.** FBA's claim to cancel SPI's registration for medicines was barred by laches (stale claim). Although FBA's predecessor first introduced Bayer medicines in the Philippines, there was no evidence they traded in medicines there after WWI [22]. FBA failed to seasonably object to SPI's registration and use of the marks for medicines until this suit was filed. Thus, SPI retains the right to use the marks for medicines [22, 23].

The Court affirmed the lower court's "division of the market" solution: SPI holds the marks for medicines, while FBA may use them for insecticides/chemicals, provided FBA adds distinctive words indicating the products come from Germany to avoid confusion [23].

**Judgment affirmed.**
