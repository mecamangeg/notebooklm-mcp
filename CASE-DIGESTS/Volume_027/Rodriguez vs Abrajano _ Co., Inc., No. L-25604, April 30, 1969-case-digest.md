I. CAPTION
PAULO RODRIGUEZ and ANTOLIN A. JARIOL (Joint-Executors of the Estate of Humiliano Rodriguez) v. ABRAJANO & CO., INC., G.R. No. L-25604, April 30, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
The Estate of Humiliano Rodriguez, represented by executors Rodriguez and Jariol, filed a complaint for unlawful detainer against Abrajano & Co., Inc. regarding a property in Cebu City covered by TCT No. 21541 [1]. The parties had an original ten-year written lease which had expired. Following the expiration, the defendant lessee continued to occupy the premises on a month-to-month basis, paying a monthly rental of P170.00 [1]. The defendant had constructed a building on the lot assessed at P15,000.00 [1]. On April 24, 1963, the plaintiffs terminated the lease and demanded the restoration of the property [1]. The defendant refused to vacate, invoking Article 1687 of the Civil Code to ask for a fixed term [1].

The Municipal Court ordered the defendant to vacate within one year. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Cebu confirmed the decision, ordering the lessee to vacate within one year from February 26, 1965 [2]. The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that it should be granted a "much longer period" than one year given the improvements made [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lessee is entitled to a lease extension period longer than one year under Article 1687 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court found no merit in the appeal and affirmed the lower court's decision.

Under Article 1687 of the Civil Code, courts have the discretion to "fix a longer term for the lease after the lessee has occupied the premises over a year" when the lease is on a month-to-month basis [2]. The Court held that the specific duration of this extension is determined by prevailing circumstances, such as the time required to find new premises [2]. Since lower courts are more familiar with local conditions, their judgment on the additional term should not be interfered with on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion, which was not present here [2].

Furthermore, the Court ruled that the construction of a building assessed at P15,000.00 does not justify a longer extension [3]. A lessee who builds on a leased property with a definite expiry date (in this case, 10 years) is expected to adjust costs to recoup the investment within that period [3]. The burden is on the lessee to prove why a different standard of prudence should apply [3]. Finally, the fact that the lessor had died and the law favors the speedy settlement of decedent's estates militated against prolonging the lease term further [3].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [4].
