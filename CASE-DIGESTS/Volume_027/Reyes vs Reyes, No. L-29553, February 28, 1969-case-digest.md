I. CAPTION
ALEJANDRO REYES v. ANATALIO REYES, G.R. No. L-29553, February 28, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Alejandro Reyes and Anatalio Reyes were candidates for Municipal Mayor of Magallanes, Cavite in the 1967 elections. Anatalio was proclaimed the winner. Alejandro filed a petition with the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to nullify the proclamation and also filed an election protest in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cavite on December 4, 1967. Unaware of the CFI protest, COMELEC initially annulled Anatalio’s proclamation. Anatalio filed a Motion for Reconsideration with COMELEC, arguing that the Commission lacked jurisdiction because Alejandro had already filed an election protest in the CFI. Relying on this representation, COMELEC reversed itself, reinstated Anatalio’s proclamation, and left the matter to the CFI. Alejandro appealed to the Supreme Court via certiorari, but it was dismissed based on the pendency of the CFI protest.

Subsequently, in the CFI proceedings, Anatalio moved to dismiss the protest, claiming that the docket fees were paid only on February 9, 1968, which was past the deadline for filing a protest. The CFI dismissed the case on this ground. Alejandro appealed the dismissal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent is barred from moving to dismiss the election protest on the ground of invalidity or late filing.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the order of dismissal must be set aside because the respondent (Anatalio) is barred from claiming that the election protest was not valid and timely filed.

The Court reasoned that Anatalio had previously represented to the COMELEC that the protest in the CFI was a valid pending action to argue that the Commission had no jurisdiction. This representation caused the COMELEC to reverse its annulment of his proclamation and caused the Supreme Court to dismiss Alejandro’s previous petition for certiorari. To allow Anatalio to now claim the protest is invalid due to late docket fees would be "utterly unfair" to the petitioner, the COMELEC, and the Court, who were all led to act on the strength of his prior allegation. Having benefited from the assertion that the protest was valid, he is estopped from attacking it.

The order of dismissal was set aside, and the case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.
