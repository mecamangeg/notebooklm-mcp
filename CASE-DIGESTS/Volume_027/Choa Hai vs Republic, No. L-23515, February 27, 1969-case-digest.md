I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF CHOA HAI TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. CHOA HAI v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-23515, February 27, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Choa Hai was granted Philippine citizenship by the Court of First Instance of Batangas in 1961. In 1963, he filed a motion to take his oath. The Provincial Fiscal opposed the motion on several grounds, including failure to state former places of residence and unqualified character witnesses. The lower court set aside the 1961 decision and denied the motion to take oath.

Choa Hai appealed, admitting that from 1921 to 1927, he actually resided in Manila, not Batangas. He argued that his failure to state this in his petition was not a violation of Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law because he was a minor at the time and his legal domicile was that of his guardian in Batangas. Additionally, it was found that three of his children were enrolled in Chinese schools. During the appeal, Choa Hai’s counsel submitted documents to the Supreme Court to prove his good character, which were later found by a Court Investigator to be forgeries purchased from a fixer.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to state a former place of residence during the petitioner's minority is a fatal defect.
2. W/N the character witnesses were qualified.
3. W/N the enrollment of children in Chinese schools bars naturalization.
4. W/N the petitioner possesses the proper and irreproachable conduct required for citizenship.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The failure to state the Manila residence is fatal. The Supreme Court held that the requirement in Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law to state "present and past places of residence" refers to **actual and substantial residence**, not legal domicile. The principle that a minor follows the domicile of the father (or guardian) does not apply where the law requires specification of actual residence [1]. Furthermore, the fact that the omission was an honest mistake does not cure the defect, as it prevents full inquiry into the applicant's behavior [2], [3].

2. **NO.** The character witnesses were not qualified. Witnesses Juan C. Perez and Aniceto Sison knew the petitioner only since 1930 and 1927, respectively. The Court ruled that character witnesses must have personal knowledge of the petitioner for the **entire duration** of his residence in the Philippines [4].

3. **YES.** The enrollment of children in schools presumed to be run by Chinese nationals and populated mostly by foreigners runs counter to the requirement that the petitioner must evince a sincere desire to embrace Philippine customs, traditions, and ideals and to mingle socially with Filipinos [5].

4. **NO.** The petitioner's conduct was not irreproachable. The Court found that submitting forged documents and certifications to the Supreme Court reflected the mettle of his moral character, making him unworthy of the privilege of citizenship. Submitting false documents constitutes behavior far from moral and irreproachable [6].

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED**, and the petitioner is declared not qualified to be admitted as a citizen [7].
