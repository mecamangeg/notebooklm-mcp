**I. CAPTION**
ABIGUEL REYES-GREGORIO, ET AL. v. ARSENIO REYES, G.R. No. L-24699, March 28, 1969, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Spouses Dominador Gregorio and Abiguel Reyes-Gregorio mortgaged a parcel of land in Malabon to the Manila Building and Loan Association to secure a P5,000.00 loan. Due to non-payment, the mortgage was extrajudicially foreclosed, and the property was sold at public auction on January 5, 1962, to appellant Arsenio Reyes. The certificate of sale stipulated a one-year redemption period ending January 5, 1963 [1].

On January 3, 1963, Abiguel tendered P6,776.00 to the Provincial Sheriff of Rizal for the redemption of the property, which the Sheriff accepted, issuing an official receipt [2]. When Abiguel later demanded a deed of reconveyance, Arsenio refused, claiming the right of redemption had expired. Abiguel filed suit. The Court of First Instance ruled in her favor, declaring the redemption valid. Arsenio appealed, arguing the redemption was not exercised in the manner provided by law [2-4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the payment of redemption money to the Sheriff, rather than directly to the purchaser, constitutes a valid exercise of the right of redemption.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court held that the redemption was valid and in accordance with law. Section 27, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, applied in relation to Act 3135 (as amended by Act 4118), explicitly states that payment of redemption money should be made "to the purchaser or redemptioner, or for him to the officer who made the sale" [4].

The Court cited *Enaje v. Vda. de A. Escaño* (38 Phil. 657), which established that it is the duty of the officer who made the sale to accept the tender of payment and execute the corresponding certificate of redemption, provided the tender is made within the prescribed period. Since Abiguel tendered payment to the Sheriff on January 3, 1963, prior to the January 5 expiration, the redemption was timely and legal [4, 5].

Decision affirmed with double costs imposed on appellant.
