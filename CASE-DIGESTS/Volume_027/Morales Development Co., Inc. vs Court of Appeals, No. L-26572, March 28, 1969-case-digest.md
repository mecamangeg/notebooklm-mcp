I. CAPTION
MORALES DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, INC. v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, HERMENEGILDO DESEO, and SOCORRO DESEO, G.R. No. L-26572, March 28, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Enrique P. Montinola, the registered owner of a parcel of land in Quezon (TCT No. T-15687), secured a second owner’s duplicate of his title after claiming the first was lost. Using this second duplicate, he sold the land to Pio Reyes in 1954. Reyes then sold it to the spouses Abella, who obtained a new title (TCT No. 21037) in their name. In 1955, the Abellas sold the land to respondents Hermenegildo and Socorro Deseo, who immediately took possession but were unable to register the sale.

In 1956, Montinola, using the *first* owner's duplicate (which was apparently not lost), sold the same land to petitioner Morales Development Co., Inc. ("Morales"). When Morales attempted to register the sale, it discovered the title had been cancelled. Morales then filed a petition to annul the second owner's duplicate, which was granted without notice to the Deseos. The Deseos subsequently filed an action to annul the sale to Morales. Morales argued that the prior sales to Reyes and the Abellas were void because the deeds stated a consideration of only P1.00, implying bad faith. The trial court ruled for Morales, but the Court of Appeals reversed the decision, declaring the Deseos the owners.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the prior sales to Reyes and the Abellas were void *ab initio* due to the stated consideration of P1.00.
2. W/N the Deseos have a better right to the ownership of the property.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The fact that the deeds stated a consideration of P1.00 does not make the contracts void *ab initio*. The Court held that it is not unusual for deeds to state a nominal consideration of P1.00 pursuant to Anglo-Saxon practice, even if the actual consideration is higher. Even assuming the amount is suspicious, this alone does not prove bad faith or lack of value. Under Articles 1318, 1355, 1381, and 1390 of the Civil Code, bad faith or inadequacy of monetary consideration may render a contract rescissible or voidable, but not inexistent (void). Furthermore, the Deseos were purchasers in good faith who relied on the clean title of their predecessors, the Abellas.

2. **YES.** The Deseos are the rightful owners. This case involves a double sale of registered land. Since neither party was able to successfully register their respective deeds of conveyance, the rule under Article 1544 of the Civil Code applies: ownership pertains to the person who first took possession in good faith. The Deseos took possession of the land long before Morales purchased it. Moreover, Morales was negligent; had it checked with the Register of Deeds before buying, it would have discovered that Montinola's title had already been cancelled and the property sold to others. As the party whose negligence was the proximate cause of the loss, Morales must suffer the consequences.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
