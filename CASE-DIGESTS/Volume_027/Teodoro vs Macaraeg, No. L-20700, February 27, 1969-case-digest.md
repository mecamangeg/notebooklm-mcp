I. CAPTION
FIDEL TEODORO v. FELIX MACARAEG and COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-20700, February 27, 1969, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Felix Macaraeg cultivated a 4-hectare farmholding in Nueva Ecija owned by petitioner Fidel Teodoro. In April 1960, they executed a "Contract of Lease" for the agricultural year 1960-1961, stipulating a rental of 9 cavans of palay per hectare. In March 1961, Teodoro notified Macaraeg that the land would be given to another tenant, claiming the contract had expired and Macaraeg had abandoned the land. Teodoro subsequently placed Jose Niegos on the land. Macaraeg filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) for reinstatement. Teodoro argued that their agreement was a civil lease, not a tenancy relationship, evidenced by the title "Contract of Lease," the absence of the word "tenant," and the fixed one-year duration. He also alleged Macaraeg abandoned the farm by offering to surrender it if a certain Luciano Claus were accepted as successor. The CAR ruled in favor of Macaraeg, declaring him a leasehold tenant, ordering reinstatement, and awarding damages based on a supplemental petition filed by Macaraeg near the end of the trial. Teodoro appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the "Contract of Lease" established a leasehold tenancy relationship despite its title and fixed one-year duration.
2. W/N the tenant's conditional offer to surrender the landholding constitutes abandonment.
3. W/N the CAR erred in awarding damages based on a supplemental petition filed late in the proceedings.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The title, label, or rubric given to a contract cannot be used to camouflage the real import of an agreement as evinced by its main provisions. A contract is what the law defines it to be, not what the parties call it. The agreement contained all essential elements of leasehold tenancy under Section 4 of R.A. 1199: (1) agricultural land; (2) size susceptible to personal cultivation (4.5 hectares); (3) personal cultivation by the lessee (implied by the stipulation that rental must be of the variety "produced by the lessee"); and (4) rental in produce. Furthermore, the expiration of the contract period does not extinguish the relationship. Security of tenure subsists by operation of law (Sec. 9, R.A. 1199, as amended), and agreements requiring the return of land after one crop year are proscribed.

2. **NO.** Abandonment requires an actual, absolute, and irrevocable desertion of one's right or property. Macaraeg's offer to vacate was conditional—predicated on Teodoro accepting Luciano Claus as his successor. Since the condition was not met, there was no absolute renunciation. Intention to surrender is not enough; there must be actual surrender. The CAR's factual findings that Macaraeg did not abandon the land are supported by substantial evidence.

3. **NO.** The Court of Agrarian Relations is not strictly bound by technical rules of procedure or evidence but must act according to justice, equity, and the substantial merits of the case (Secs. 10 and 11, R.A. 1267). Social justice mandates flexibility to assist the underprivileged. Under Section 11 of R.A. 1267, the CAR may include in its order any matter deemed necessary to settle the dispute, provided it is established by competent evidence, even if not specifically pleaded. Thus, the award of damages was proper as it was supported by evidence.

**Disposition:** The decision and resolution are **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the earnings of the tenant during the period of unlawful ejectment (P30.00) shall NOT be deducted from the award of damages, pursuant to Section 27(1) in relation to Section 22(1) of R.A. 1199.
