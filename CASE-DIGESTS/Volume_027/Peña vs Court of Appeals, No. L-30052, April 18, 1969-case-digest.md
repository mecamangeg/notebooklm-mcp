I. CAPTION
CAMILO PEÑA Y VALENZUELA and DOMINGO CAJIPE Y DACUNO v. THE COURT OF APPEALS (SPECIAL SECOND DIVISION), G.R. No. L-30052, April 18, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Camilo Peña filed a second motion for reconsideration alleging that the Supreme Court had resolved on February 17, 1969, to refer his petition to the Solicitor General for comment—which he argued was tantamount to giving the petition due course—and that said resolution was not released due to oversight [1, 2]. The Court denied the motion on March 14, 1969, and finding these allegations to be untrue, required Peña to show cause why he should not be cited for contempt [3]. Peña filed a manifestation explaining that he prepared the motion in a state of "frenzied desperation" while hiding from an arrest warrant issued by Court of First Instance Judge Arsenio Solidum [3, 4]. He admitted that he relied on hearsay reports from a friend regarding the status of his case because he could not personally verify the records due to fear of arrest, and he apologized for the baseless allegations [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner Peña should be held in contempt for making false allegations in his motion for reconsideration.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court accepted petitioner's explanation and apology as sufficient to negate malice and bad faith [7]. However, the Court **admonished** Peña, holding that he, like any member of the bar or party in a case, must carefully verify the truth and correctness of statements of fact made in pleadings [7]. The Court warned that any subsequent similar misconduct would be dealt with more severely [7].

None. Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Fernando, Capistrano, Teehankee, and Barredo, JJ., concurred [8].
