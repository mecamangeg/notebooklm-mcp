I. CAPTION
MALAYAN INSURANCE CO., INC. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-22687, March 28, 1969, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Malayan Insurance Co., Inc., as subrogee of consignee Rosario del Valle, filed a complaint against Manila Port Service (MPS), the arrastre operator, for the value of 124 bags of wheat flour missing from a shipment. The carrying vessel S.S. "Varda" arrived in Manila on May 30, 1961. The consignee filed a provisional claim with MPS on May 31, 1961. However, the shipment was actually discharged into the custody of MPS on June 1, 1961, one day after the claim was filed.

The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Malayan Insurance, holding that the filing of the claim one day before discharge was "substantial compliance" with Section 15 of the Management Contract, which requires claims to be filed within 15 days from the date of discharge. MPS appealed to the Supreme Court on a question of law, arguing the claim was premature and speculative.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a provisional claim filed one day before the actual discharge of goods constitutes valid compliance with the Management Contract.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the lower court regarding this cause of action. The Court ruled that a provisional claim filed before the date of discharge is "premature and speculative" and does not constitute substantial compliance with Section 15 of the Management Contract [1].

The Court cited *Switzerland General Insurance Co., Ltd. v. Manila Railroad*, distinguishing between two situations: (1) where a claim is filed ahead of discharge without knowledge of the shipment's condition (premature), and (2) where the consignee discovers or is informed of damage before discharge and then files (valid) [1]. In this case, the claim was filed on May 31 while the goods were still aboard the vessel, and discharge did not occur until June 1. There was no evidence the consignee had knowledge of the loss at the time of filing; the claim was merely a generic notice for "bad order/non-delivery" [2]. Thus, the claim was time-barred. The decision is reversed.
