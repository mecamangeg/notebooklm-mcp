I. CAPTION
SANTOS ANDAL, ET AL. v. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-29814, March 28, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, members of the Jehovah's Witnesses, sought to bury Dorotea Bosque (wife of petitioner Teofilo Cal) in the Catholic cemetery of Barrio Manguiring, Calabanga, Camarines Sur, which was in the possession of the Catholic Church [1]. Although they obtained a death certificate indicating the Catholic cemetery as the burial site, they lacked permission from the parish priest [1, 2]. Instead of seeking authority, they deceived the caretaker, employed threats and force to enter the cemetery, and performed their own religious rites (hymns) to assert superiority over the Church [2].

The trial court convicted them of offending religious feelings (Art. 133, Revised Penal Code) [3]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals modified the judgment, convicting them instead of **unjust vexation** (Art. 287, par. 2, RPC) and imposing a penalty of 30 days *arresto menor* and a fine [4]. Petitioners appealed via certiorari, arguing that the burial was a performance of a legal duty [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners are criminally liable for unjust vexation despite their claim of performing a legal duty to bury the deceased.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the petitioners' claim of performing a legal duty cannot excuse their actions because they "took the law in their own hands by employing force" [6]. The Court noted that while there is a duty to bury the dead, the facts showed the petitioners did not act out of necessity (as other burial sites were available nearby), but rather out of a "preconceived plan" to defy and vex the Church authorities [2, 5]. The rule of law would be meaningless if the employment of force in defiance of legal norms—except in legitimate instances like self-defense—were not considered reprehensible [6]. Consequently, the Supreme Court denied the motion for reconsideration [7].
