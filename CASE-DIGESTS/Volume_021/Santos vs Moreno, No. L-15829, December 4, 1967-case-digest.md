I. CAPTION
ROMAN R. SANTOS v. HON. FLORENCIO MORENO, as Secretary of Public Works & Communications and JULIAN C. CARGULLO, G.R. No. L-15829, December 4, 1967, 21 SCRA 1141, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
The Zobel family (Ayala y Cia.) originally owned Hacienda San Esteban, a vast marshland in Macabebe, Pampanga. To access nipa palms in the interior, they dug interlinking canals. Later, the hacienda was converted into fishponds, and the canals were closed with dikes. Roman Santos acquired the property and continued maintaining the dikes. Following the enactment of Republic Act No. 2056 in 1958, residents petitioned for the opening of the streams. Respondent Secretary of Public Works conducted an investigation and ordered the demolition of the dikes, declaring the streams public navigable waters. Santos filed a petition for injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI granted the injunction, ruling that the streams were private. The Secretary appealed, arguing improper venue, failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and that the streams were public.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies.
2. W/N venue was properly laid in the CFI of Manila.
3. W/N the lower court erred in conducting a trial *de novo*.
4. W/N the streams in question are of public ownership.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The failure to file a motion for reconsideration or appeal to the President was not fatal. R.A. 2056 establishes a summary proceeding where the legislative intent to forego a motion for reconsideration is manifest. Furthermore, the issues raised—constitutionality of the law and jurisdiction—are purely legal questions properly aired before the courts. Under the *alter ego* doctrine, an appeal to the President was also dispensable as the Secretary's acts are presumed to have the President's implied sanction.

2. **YES.** Venue was proper. Although the case involves the ownership of streams, the suit's primary purpose is to review and enjoin the acts of the Secretary of Public Works. It is a personal action seeking to control the official's acts, not a real action. Therefore, it was correctly filed in Manila where the respondent Secretary holds office.

3. **YES.** In reviewing administrative decisions, the court must confine its inquiry to the evidence presented during the administrative proceedings. It was error for the lower court to admit new evidence and conduct a trial *de novo*. The Supreme Court reviewed the case based solely on the administrative evidence.

4. **NO (with one exception).** Under Article 339(1) of the Spanish Civil Code, canals constructed by the State for public use are public; conversely, canals constructed by private persons within private lands and devoted exclusively to private use are of private ownership. The evidence, including the "Panopio Report," proved that most of the streams were artificial canals originally dug by the hacienda owners for their exclusive use and were guarded against public access. They did not lose their private nature by prescription as the public was prohibited from using them. **However**, regarding **Sapang Cansusu**, the evidence showed it is a natural stream and a continuation of the Cansusu River; thus, it belongs to the public domain.

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED**, except as to Sapang Cansusu which is declared public and regarding which the judgment is **REVERSED**.
