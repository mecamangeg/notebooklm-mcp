I. CAPTION
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA vs. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and/or BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-25871, October 23, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Insurance Company of North America, acting as subrogee for the consignee Ed. A. Keller & Co., sought to recover P3,718.74 representing the value of six cases of chemical compounds lost while in the custody of the Bureau of Customs [1]. The shipment arrived via the SS "Pioneer Myth" and was discharged to the Bureau, which was then operating the arrastre service [1]. The City Court of Manila initially ruled in favor of the petitioner [2]. However, the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the case on appeal, holding that the Bureau of Customs had no legal personality to be sued and that the Republic could not be sued without its consent [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs can be sued for money claims arising from the arrastre service.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Bureau of Customs cannot be sued because the arrastre service is a necessary incidental function to its primary governmental function of taxation [3]. For reasons of public policy, it enjoys immunity from suit to prevent hampering its governmental functions, a principle that applies equally to the Republic of the Philippines [3]. The Court cited *Equitable Insurance & Casualty Co., Inc. v. Smith, Bell & Co.* in support of this doctrine [3]. The proper procedure for money claims against the Republic is to file them with the Auditor General pursuant to Act 3083, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 327 [4].

The judgment appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [4].
