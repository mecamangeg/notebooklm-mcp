I. CAPTION
REGINO G. AQUIZAP v. EUGENIO BASILIO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21293, December 29, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On December 10, 1946, petitioner Regino Aquizap filed Civil Case No. 1150 in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zambales against Eugenio Basilio and others to recover damages amounting to P528.00 (value of palay) and P200.00 (other damages). On July 29, 1953, this complaint was dismissed for Aquizap's failure to appear at the hearing, "without prejudice to the filing of a new complaint."

On November 3, 1953 (noted as 1958 in the Court's analysis), Aquizap filed a new action (Civil Case No. 1631) in the same CFI, reproducing the allegations and prayer of the previous complaint. Basilio died and was substituted by his heirs, who moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of prescription. The CFI dismissed the amended complaint, ruling that the action was barred by the statute of limitations. Aquizap appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved only questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction over the new complaint filed by the petitioner.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the CFI lacked jurisdiction.

The rule is firmly imbedded in jurisprudence that jurisdiction is determined by the statute in force at the time of the filing of the action [1, 2]. While the CFI had jurisdiction under Act 136 when the first case was filed in 1946, that jurisdiction was fully discharged and terminated when the case was dismissed on July 29, 1953 [3]. The order of dismissal, though "without prejudice," finally disposed of the first case [1, 3].

Consequently, the refiled case was a completely new action and not a continuation of the dismissed case [4]. Since the new action was filed after the Judiciary Act of 1948 took effect on June 17, 1948, the new law governed [2, 5]. Under Section 88 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, inferior courts (not the CFI) had exclusive original jurisdiction over demands not exceeding P2,000.00. Because Aquizap's total claim was only roughly P728.00, it fell below the minimum jurisdiction of the CFI [6].

Appeal dismissed and the proceedings in the lower court set aside.
