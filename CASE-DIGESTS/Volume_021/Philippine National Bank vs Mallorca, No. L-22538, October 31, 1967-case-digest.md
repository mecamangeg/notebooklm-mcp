I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. PRIMITIVA MALLORCA, G.R. No. L-22538, October 31, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Ruperta Lavilles mortgaged a 48,965-square meter lot in Passi, Iloilo to petitioner Philippine National Bank (PNB) to secure a loan. The mortgage was duly recorded [1]. Subsequently, Lavilles sold a 20,000-square meter portion of the lot to respondent Primitiva Mallorca without PNB's consent [1]. Mallorca secured a court order to annotate the sale on the title, resulting in the issuance of TCT No. T-24256 with separate co-owner’s copies for Lavilles and Mallorca; however, PNB’s mortgage lien was annotated on both copies [2].

When Lavilles defaulted, PNB extrajudicially foreclosed on the property and acquired it as the highest bidder [2]. Mallorca filed a civil suit to enforce her right of redemption but failed to exercise it within the period decreed by the court [3, 4]. When PNB sought to consolidate its title, the Register of Deeds refused to register the final deed of sale without Mallorca’s co-owner’s copy [4]. PNB petitioned the lower court (sitting as a cadastral court) to cancel Mallorca's copy. The court ordered Mallorca to surrender her title [5]. Mallorca appealed, arguing that her undivided interest was not affected by the foreclosure as she was not a party to the mortgage, and that the cadastral court lacked jurisdiction over the controversy [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Mallorca’s undivided interest in the property is bound by the foreclosure despite her not being a party to the mortgage loan.
2. W/N the cadastral court has jurisdiction to order the cancellation of Mallorca's certificate of title.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A recorded real estate mortgage is a right *in rem* and a lien inseparable from the property, subjecting the property to the fulfillment of the obligation whoever the possessor may be, under Article 2126 of the Civil Code [6]. Furthermore, a mortgage is indivisible, meaning each parcel answers for the totality of the debt pursuant to Article 2089 of the Civil Code [7]. As the mortgage was registered, it served as notice to the whole world (Section 51, Land Registration Act), and Mallorca is bound by the encumbrance noted on her certificate of title (Section 39, Land Registration Act) [8]. Her failure to exercise her right of redemption extinguished her interest in the land [8].

2. **YES.** While cadastral courts generally lack jurisdiction over contentious litigation, this applies only to unresolved issues [9]. In this case, the validity of the encumbrance was already settled in the prior civil case regarding Mallorca's redemption rights [9]. Under Sections 111 and 112 of the Land Registration Act, a cadastral court has jurisdiction to entertain a petition for the cancellation of a title where the registered owner has been lawfully divested and there is no substantial controversy remaining [9, 10].

The Order of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [11].
