I. CAPTION
FEDERICO G. REAL, JR. v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, THE COMMISSIONER OF CIVIL SERVICE, and ROGELIO BENJAMIN, G.R. No. L-27266, September 29, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Real was appointed by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) on October 1, 1964, as an "Election Registrar." While COMELEC denominated the appointment as permanent, the Commissioner of Civil Service approved it as "provisional" under R.A. 2260. Crucially, the appointment did not designate a specific official station. Real was initially assigned to Sibulan, Negros Oriental, but later exchanged assignments to Bais, Negros Oriental. On December 29, 1966, respondent Benjamin was extended a permanent appointment specifically as Election Registrar for Bais. Real petitioned COMELEC for retention in Bais, claiming preferential rights based on seniority guidelines and security of tenure. COMELEC denied his request. Real filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus with the Supreme Court, arguing he had acquired a vested right to the station.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is entitled to security of tenure over the specific station of Election Registrar of Bais, Negros Oriental.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that only officers who are **appointed**—not merely **assigned**—to particular stations are entitled to invoke the constitutional guaranty of security of tenure. Since Real's appointment did not indicate a specific official station, his subsequent detail to Bais via directive did not grant him a right to be retained there against an appointee specifically named for that place.

Furthermore, the Court held that having accepted the provisional appointment and discharged its functions, Real cannot now impugn its validity to claim it should be treated as permanent. Relying on *Braganza v. Commission on Elections* and *Ibañez v. Commission on Elections*, the Court emphasized that the power to appoint is discretionary. The COMELEC guidelines invoked by Real applied only to assignments, not to the discretion of the authority to make new permanent appointments.

Accordingly, the petition is dismissed and the writ of preliminary injunction is dissolved.
