I. CAPTION
AMANDO AÑONUEVO, ET AL. v. ALBERTO AÑONUEVO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22269, December 20, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants (children of Tomas Añonuevo by his first marriage) filed a complaint for the partition of six parcels of land against defendants-appellees (children of Tomas by his second marriage and other heirs). Defendants filed a counterclaim seeking the partition of nine other lots allegedly owned by the common father but held by plaintiffs. The trial court ordered the partition of the six lots in the complaint and three of the nine lots in the counterclaim (Lots 5705, 5765, and 5805).

Plaintiffs appealed only regarding the three lots in the counterclaim, arguing that plaintiff Teofila Añonuevo possessed "reconstituted" Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs) over them, and thus partition would violate the indefeasibility of Torrens titles. The records revealed that Teofila first sought to reconstitute *Original* Certificates of Title in one court branch, which was denied after it was shown the titles were in Tomas' name. She later filed a second petition in a different branch to reconstitute *Transfer* Certificates based on alleged sales from Tomas, concealing the first denial. This second petition was granted, issuing TCTs to her. However, the alleged sales occurred on impossible dates (e.g., three days after Tomas died), proving the TCTs were obtained through fraud.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the order of partition violates the principle of indefeasibility of Torrens titles given the existence of reconstituted transfer certificates in the name of the plaintiff.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. The Court held that the order of partition does not review or impair the validity of the original decrees of registration. The "reconstituted" titles invoked by the plaintiffs were secured through misrepresentation, deceit, and fraud, as evidenced by the fact that no such transfer certificates ever existed prior to the reconstitution and the alleged sales were fictitious (occurring after the seller's death).

The Court ruled that the lower court correctly regarded Teofila Añonuevo as a mere **trustee** for the heirs of the original owner, Tomas Añonuevo, with the legal obligation to convey to them their respective shares. The judgment of partition is therefore consistent with the principles of justice, equity, and fair play.

**Decision affirmed.**
