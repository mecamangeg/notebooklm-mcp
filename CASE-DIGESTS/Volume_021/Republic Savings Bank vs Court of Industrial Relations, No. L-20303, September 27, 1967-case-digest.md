I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC SAVINGS BANK (now REPUBLIC BANK) v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ROSENDO T. RESUELLO, et al., G.R. No. L-20303, September 27, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On July 9, 1958, eight respondent employees of Republic Savings Bank wrote and published a letter to the Bank President, Ramon Racelis, demanding his resignation. The letter cited grounds of immorality, nepotism, favoritism, discrimination in promotions, and tolerance of dishonesty and irregularities within the bank. Copies were furnished to the Chairman of the Board and the Central Bank Governor. Consequently, the Bank dismissed the employees.

The employees filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) alleging Unfair Labor Practice (ULP). The Bank moved to dismiss, arguing the employees were discharged for cause (libel) and not for union activities, noting the employees admitted the letter was an "individual" act, not a union one. The CIR ruled in favor of the employees, finding the Bank guilty of ULP and ordering reinstatement with back wages. The Bank appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the employees for writing and publishing a letter of complaint against the Bank President constitutes Unfair Labor Practice.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's decision.

The Court held that even assuming the employees acted in their individual capacities, they were nonetheless protected because they were engaged in a **concerted activity** for mutual aid and protection. Interference with this right constitutes Unfair Labor Practice under **Section 4(a)(1) of the Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act No. 875)**. The joining in protests or demands, even by a small group of employees, is protected if it is in furtherance of their interests, regardless of whether union activity is involved or collective bargaining is contemplated.

The complaints against nepotism, favoritism, and management practices fell within the proper sphere of collective bargaining. Instead of dismissing the employees, the Bank should have referred the charges to the grievance committee, as collective bargaining is a continuous process that includes the adjustment of grievances under **Section 13 of R.A. 875**. While the right to self-organization is not unlimited and employers have the right to discharge for cause, the Industrial Peace Act prohibits the abuse of that right to interfere with protected concerted activities. The Court found the dismissal was made on account of the letter touching on labor-management relations, which the Bank could not punish by summary discharge in disregard of its duty to bargain collectively.

The petition was DENIED, and the CIR decision was AFFIRMED.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Fernando, J. (Concurring):**
Justice Fernando concurred, stating that while the employees' "ultimatum" approach was not traditional bargaining, the mass dismissal left the unions leaderless, making collective bargaining impossible. He categorized the Bank's action specifically as "interference, restraint or coercion" under Section 4(a)(1) of the Act.
