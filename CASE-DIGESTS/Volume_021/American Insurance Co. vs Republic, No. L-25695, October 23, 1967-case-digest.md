I. CAPTION
AMERICAN INSURANCE COMPANY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-25695, October 23, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
American Insurance Company filed a suit against the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs regarding the arrastre operations conducted by the Customs Arrastre Service [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila issued an order regarding the case, which the plaintiff subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court [1]. The appeal centers on the legal question of whether the defendants can be sued without their consent [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs may be sued for claims arising from arrastre operations.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the arrastre operation performed by the Customs Arrastre Service is a necessary incident of the prime governmental function of taxation [2]. Therefore, no suit can be filed against the Republic or its agencies involved in said operation without its consent [2]. The Court applied the doctrine previously established in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service and Bureau of Customs* (L-23139, December 17, 1966) [2].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [3].
