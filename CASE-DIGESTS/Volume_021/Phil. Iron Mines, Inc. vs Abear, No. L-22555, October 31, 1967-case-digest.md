I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE IRON MINES, INC. v. TOMAS ABEAR and WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-22555, October 31, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Tomas Abear, an employee of petitioner Philippine Iron Mines since 1934, suffered an accident in 1936 resulting in the amputation of his left leg below the knee. He received P600.00 in compensation and later returned to work using a prosthetic support. On January 12, 1957, while moving a bolt threader, Abear slipped and fell, causing his stump to bleed profusely. This necessitated a second operation on February 19, 1957, amputating the left leg above the knee.

In 1962, following his layoff due to retrenchment, Abear filed a claim for compensation. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded him full compensation for the loss of the left leg above the knee. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations and that the P600.00 paid in 1936 should be deducted from the new award.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claim for compensation is barred by the statute of limitations.
2. W/N the compensation paid for the 1936 amputation (below the knee) should be deducted from the compensation for the 1957 amputation (above the knee).

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The defense of the statute of limitations cannot be invoked for the first time on appeal; it is deemed waived if not seasonably pleaded in the lower court. Furthermore, the petitioner failed to report the 1957 accident to the WCC within the period prescribed by Section 45 of Act No. 3428. Consequently, the petitioner is deemed to have renounced the right to controvert the claim.

2. **NO.** No such deduction can be made because the law does not provide for it. Under Sections 17 and 18 of Act No. 3428, the law fixes specific compensation for specific disabilities. For the loss of a leg (amputation at or above the knee), the compensation is 50% of average weekly wages for 190 weeks. The Court ruled it cannot, by judicial fiat, qualify this provision by adding "less the compensation formerly paid for the previous loss of a foot." Unlike other jurisdictions that have "apportionment statutes" to handle pre-existing disabilities, Philippine law contains no such provision, and the Court must apply the law as written.

The decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is affirmed.
