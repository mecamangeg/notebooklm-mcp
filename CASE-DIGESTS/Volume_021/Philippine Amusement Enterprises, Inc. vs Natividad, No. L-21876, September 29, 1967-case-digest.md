I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE AMUSEMENT ENTERPRISES, INC. v. SOLEDAD NATIVIDAD and MARIANO NATIVIDAD, G.R. No. L-21876, September 29, 1967, 21 SCRA 284, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On January 6, 1961, Philippine Amusement Enterprises, Inc. (plaintiff) leased an automatic phonograph ("jukebox") to Soledad Natividad (defendant) for her establishment in Davao City for a period of three years [1], [2]. The contract gave the plaintiff exclusive rights to maintain the phonograph on the premises and stipulated a 75-25% sharing of gross receipts [3]. On July 17, 1961, shortly after the lease began, the defendant's husband demanded the removal of the jukebox, alleging it was defective because coins would "stock up" and it failed to play selected records [4], [5]. The defendants unilaterally removed the rented jukebox and replaced it with one they had ordered from the United States [6], [7]. Plaintiff sued for specific performance and damages [8]. The Court of First Instance of Davao ruled in favor of the defendants, rescinding the lease because the plaintiff allegedly failed to render the machine suitable for its purpose [9]. Plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court [10].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendants were justified in unilaterally rescinding the contract of lease due to the alleged breach by the plaintiff.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. Under **Article 1191 of the Civil Code**, the right to resolve reciprocal obligations is implied in case of non-compliance, but in the absence of a stipulation to the contrary, this power must be **invoked judicially** [11]. A party cannot exercise this right solely on their own judgment. Furthermore, judicial rescission is only granted when the breach is **substantial** enough to defeat the object of the parties, not for slight or casual breaches [12], [13]. The Court found the alleged defects (occasional coin jams) to be minor and noted that the defendants likely manufactured the complaint to operate their own machine for greater profit [7].

**ACCORDINGLY**, the judgment is reversed, the contract is rescinded in favor of the plaintiff, and defendants are ordered to return the phonograph and pay P5,850 in liquidated damages, plus interest and attorney's fees [14].
