**I. CAPTION**
PERFECTO D. KORDOVEZ v. SOFRONIO C. CARMONA, G.R. No. L-21473, October 31, 1967, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Kordovez, a desk sergeant in the San Carlos City police force, was administratively charged and suspended from office by respondent Mayor Carmona on September 19, 1962 [1]. On October 24, 1962, the Municipal Board rendered a decision dismissing him from service [2]. Kordovez appealed this decision to the Commissioner of Civil Service [2]. After 60 days from his preventive suspension, Kordovez requested reinstatement pending his appeal, invoking Section 35 of the Civil Service Act of 1959 (R.A. 2260) [2]. The Mayor refused, prompting Kordovez to file a petition for Mandamus with the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental for reinstatement and back salaries [3]. The trial court dismissed the petition, ruling against Kordovez [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a police officer is entitled to automatic reinstatement after 60 days of preventive suspension when the delay in the final disposition of his case is due to his appeal to the Civil Service Commissioner.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that Kordovez is not entitled to reinstatement. The applicable law is Section 3 of R.A. No. 557, a special law governing provincial guards and police officers, and not R.A. No. 2260, which is a general law covering all public officials [4]. A general law does not repeal a special law unless expressly provided [4].

Under R.A. No. 557, while a suspended policeman is entitled to reinstatement if his case is not decided within 60 days, this right does not apply if the delay is due to his own fault or petition [5]. In this case, the Municipal Board decided to remove him within the 60-day period (on October 24, 1962); the case was not "finally disposed of" only because Kordovez voluntarily appealed to the Commissioner of Civil Service [6]. This appeal excused the delay in the definite disposition of charges [6]. Furthermore, it is contrary to the spirit of mandamus to compel the reinstatement of an officer who has already been found guilty and dropped from service by a competent body [7].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [7].
