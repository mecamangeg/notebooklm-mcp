**I. CAPTION**
F.E.F. REMOTIGUE, ET AL. v. HON. SERGIO OSMEÑA, JR., G.R. No. L-28202, November 10, 1967, Per Curiam.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners F.E.F. Remotigue, officials of the Nacionalista Party Cebu Chapter, and others filed an original action in the Supreme Court captioned "For Injunction and Declaratory Relief" against respondent Sergio Osmeña, Jr. [1, 2]. The petitioners challenged Osmeña's qualification to run for City Mayor of Cebu City in the November 14, 1967 general elections [3]. They argued that Osmeña filed his certificate of candidacy for Mayor without resigning from his office as Senator, allegedly violating Section 9 of the Charter of Cebu City, which prohibits elective city officials from holding any other public office [4]. The petitioners prayed for the Court to declare Osmeña disqualified, declare his certificate of candidacy void, and restrain him from running for Mayor or resigning as Senator [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over the petition for injunction and declaratory relief regarding the respondent's qualification.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the complaint [5]. The Court held that determining the issue raised by the petitioners—specifically the qualification of the respondent under the City Charter—would amount to rendering a declaratory judgment and a judgment in an original action for injunction [6]. These matters do not fall within the original exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court [6, 7]. Furthermore, the Court noted that the allegations in the complaint did not warrant treating the action as a petition for certiorari or prohibition, or any other action cognizable within the Court's original and exclusive jurisdiction [6].

Complaint dismissed [5].
