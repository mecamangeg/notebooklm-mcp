I. CAPTION
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. WARNER, BARNES & CO., LTD., REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and/or BUREAU OF CUSTOMS and/or CUSTOMS ARRASTRE SERVICE, G.R. No. L-24106, October 31, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On September 23, 1963, Ford Motor Co., Ltd. shipped auto parts from London to Manila aboard the SS "Saikyo Maru," operated by Warner, Barnes & Co., Ltd. [1]. The shipment was discharged into the custody of the Bureau of Customs as arrastre operator and delivered to the consignee in a damaged condition [1]. The Insurance Company of North America (Petitioner), as insurer, paid the consignee P2,243.92 and, as subrogee, filed a complaint for sum of money against Warner, Barnes & Co., Ltd. and the Republic of the Philippines/Bureau of Customs in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [2].

The CFI dismissed the complaint on the grounds that: (1) the Bureau of Customs, being a government agency, is immune from suit without its consent; and (2) the amount claimed (P2,243.92) was below the jurisdictional limit of the CFI [2]. Petitioner appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Bureau of Customs can be sued for its operation of the arrastre service.
2. W/N the CFI has jurisdiction over the subject matter despite the amount of the claim being below its jurisdictional limit.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Bureau of Customs cannot be sued. It is neither a natural nor a juridical person, but merely an arm of the Department of Finance with no personality apart from the National Government [4]. While arrastre service is a proprietary function, it is a necessary incident to the governmental function of assessing and collecting duties [4]. Thus, the suit is a money claim against the State, which has not waived its immunity [4]. Statutory provisions waiving State immunity must be construed *strictissimi juris* [5].

2. **YES.** The appeal is sustained regarding the jurisdiction over the subject matter. The cause of action against Warner, Barnes & Co., Ltd. is one of admiralty, which falls within the jurisdiction of the CFI [6]. Under Section 5, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court, causes of action may be joined [7]. Since the admiralty claim is cognizable by the CFI, the suit was properly filed there, even if the alternative money claim against the arrastre operator would normally fall under the jurisdiction of the municipal court due to the amount involved [8].

The order of dismissal is affirmed as to the Republic and Bureau of Customs, but the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings insofar as Warner, Barnes & Co., Ltd. is concerned [9].
