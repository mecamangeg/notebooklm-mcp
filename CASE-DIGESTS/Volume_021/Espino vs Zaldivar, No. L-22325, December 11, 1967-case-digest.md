I. CAPTION
CORAZON M. ESPINO v. HON. CALIXTO ZALDIVAR, COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, and PATRICIO DUMLAO, G.R. No. L-22325, December 11, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Corazon Espino and respondent Patricio Dumlao were candidates for Governor of Nueva Vizcaya in the November 1963 elections. The Provincial Treasurer's copies of election returns from six precincts in Aglipay were delayed and, upon arrival on December 2, 1963, were found to be tampered (envelopes slit, seals broken, and erasures favoring Espino). The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) ordered the Provincial Board of Canvassers (BOC) to use the Municipal Treasurer's copies, which were authentic and unaltered.

Disregarding the order, the original BOC allegedly convened on December 26, 1963, using the falsified Provincial Treasurer's copies, and proclaimed Espino as Governor-elect. The COMELEC declared this proclamation void for being contrary to its orders and for being factually spurious, as the BOC Chairman (Provincial Fiscal) admitted no canvass took place on that date. When the original BOC members failed to appear for the rescheduled canvass on January 1, 1964, the COMELEC appointed a substitute BOC. This substitute board, which included Rodolfo Agbayani (a Deputy Clerk of Court not expressly listed in the succession law), canvassed the genuine Municipal Treasurer's returns and proclaimed Dumlao as Governor-elect on January 2, 1964. Espino filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition to annul Dumlao's proclamation.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N COMELEC has the authority to order the BOC to disregard tampered returns and use the Municipal Treasurer's copies instead of resorting to a judicial recount under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code.
2. W/N the COMELEC could order a new canvass despite the alleged prior proclamation of the petitioner.
3. W/N the substitute Board of Canvassers was validly constituted despite the appointment of a Deputy Clerk of Court, who is not among the officials enumerated in Section 159 of the Revised Election Code.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the Board of Canvassers possesses quasi-judicial powers to determine if a return is genuine and may disregard one that is obviously a forgery. Section 163 of the Revised Election Code, which mandates a judicial recount, applies only when there are contradictions between *authentic* copies due to clerical errors, not when returns are tampered with to subvert the will of the people [1, 2]. Under Section 3 of the Revised Election Code, the COMELEC has supervisory power to enforce election laws and ensure honest elections; it acted correctly in ordering the use of the genuine Municipal Treasurer's copies to prevent a patent fraud [3].

2. **YES.** The alleged proclamation of Espino on December 26, 1963, was null and void *ab initio*. First, it was made in defiance of COMELEC's lawful orders to use genuine returns [4]. Second, the Court found the proclamation factually spurious, as the Chairman of the Board admitted no meeting occurred on that date [5, 6]. A void proclamation acts as no proclamation at all, and the COMELEC retains the power to order a valid canvass and proclamation [4].

3. **YES.** The appointment of the Deputy Clerk of Court was valid. While Section 159 of the Revised Election Code lists specific officials as substitutes (e.g., Superintendent of Schools, District Engineer), the law requires a seven-member board (Section 158). When the listed substitutes are unavailable or insufficient to complete the quorum, the COMELEC may appoint other qualified officials to prevent delay in the proclamation [7]. The statutory list is not exclusive when necessity demands otherwise to fulfill the board's composition.

The petition is **DISMISSED**.
