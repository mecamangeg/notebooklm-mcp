I. CAPTION
MANUEL R. GO v. ROMULO CANDOY, Adm. Case No. 736, October 23, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Manuel R. Go filed a disbarment case against respondent Atty. Romulo Candoy for alleged deceit and grossly immoral conduct arising from a land transaction [1]. Go and Candoy entered into an agreement regarding a lot in Makati; after Go made initial payments to the Makati Development Corporation (MDC), Candoy executed an "Agreement to Purchase and Sell" in favor of Go [1]. Go alleged he paid Candoy an additional P2,000 in cash, a claim Candoy denied under oath [1, 2]. Subsequently, Candoy rescinded the agreement and sold the lot to Spouses Barrientos, citing Go's default on payments [1, 3]. Go filed civil and criminal cases against Candoy, as well as this administrative complaint [1]. During the proceedings, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss based on an amicable settlement [4]. However, the Solicitor General recommended admonishing Candoy, arguing that the rescission was based on a trivial violation (non-payment of association dues) and doubting Candoy's denial of receiving the P2,000 [2, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Atty. Candoy is guilty of deceit and grossly immoral conduct warranting disciplinary action despite the amicable settlement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court dismissed the complaint [6].

The Court ruled that while a disbarment case may proceed regardless of the complainant's interest or settlement, the charge must be established by convincing proof [7]. The burden of proof rests upon the complainant, and the record must disclose a case free from doubt [8].

The Court found the Solicitor General erred in doubting Candoy's denial of the P2,000 payment, as Go failed to present a receipt or any evidence to substantiate his bare allegation [9]. Furthermore, the Solicitor General erred in characterizing the breach as trivial; the record showed Go failed to pay the sizeable unpaid balance of the purchase price (P3,122.99), not just the association dues [10]. In rescinding the agreement, Candoy merely exercised a power explicitly conferred by the contract, and thus did not act with unfairness or oppressiveness [10]. Absent proof of the charges, Candoy was entitled to exoneration [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Sanchez, Angeles, and Fernando concurred with the decision [6].
