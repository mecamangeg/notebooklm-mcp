I. CAPTION
OLEGARIA BLANZA and MARIA PASION v. ATTY. AGUSTIN ARCANGEL, Adm. Case No. 492, September 5, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
In April 1955, respondent Atty. Arcangel volunteered to help complainants Blanza and Pasion with their respective pension claims regarding the deaths of their husbands, who were P.C. soldiers. The complainants handed over pertinent documents and signed blank papers. After six years of inaction, the complainants demanded the return of their documents, which the respondent allegedly refused to surrender [1]. The respondent argued that he was not obliged to follow up on the claims as there was no agreement for compensation. He explained that the failure to immediately return the documents was due to the complainants' refusal to shoulder the photostating expenses, which prevented him from withdrawing the documents from the photostat service. He eventually paid the expenses himself and returned the documents during the investigation conducted by the Fiscal [2]. Fiscal Raña recommended exoneration or reprimand, while the Solicitor General recommended severe reprimand [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent lawyer is administratively liable for professional non-feasance despite having only volunteered his professional services.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Court ruled that the evidence adduced was insufficient to warrant disciplinary action. While the Court emphasized that a lawyer who establishes an attorney-client relationship—even voluntarily—is bound to attend to the client's claims with all due diligence, the accusations against the respondent were not substantiated by a clear preponderance of evidence [4, 5]. The respondent's explanation regarding the unpaid photostating costs was not controverted by the complainants, suggesting they were partly to blame for the delay [5, 6]. Regarding the specific allegation that respondent failed to return all of complainant Pasion's documents, the Court found an equiponderance of evidence, which must redound to the benefit of the respondent [6]. The Court admonished the respondent to better uphold the high standards of the bar but dismissed the case [7, 8].
