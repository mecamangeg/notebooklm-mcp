**I. CAPTION**
TAHIMIK RAMIREZ v. ATTY. JAIME S. NER, Adm. Case No. 500, September 27, 1967, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
On April 5, 1960, respondent Atty. Jaime S. Ner notarized a deed of sale for a motor vehicle at the request of his officemate, Atty. Gavino Abaya, Jr. (the vendor). While Abaya signed and acknowledged the instrument before respondent, the vendee, Edwardo Reyes, was not present [1, 2]. Respondent notarized the deed relying on Abaya's promise that he would bring the vendee the next day to sign [2]. However, Reyes stole the car and the notarized deed, registered the vehicle in his name, and subsequently sold it to petitioner Ramirez [3]. Ramirez, relying on the notarized deed, bought the car in good faith but was later charged with qualified theft alongside Reyes [3, 4]. While Ramirez was acquitted, respondent admitted during the criminal trial that he notarized the deed without the vendee's presence [4]. Ramirez subsequently filed this disbarment case [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N respondent violated his oath as a lawyer and notary public by notarizing the deed of sale without the presence of the vendee.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that a notarial document is by law entitled to full faith and credit upon its face; thus, notaries public must observe the utmost care in complying with elementary formalities [5]. By affixing his signature and notarial seal, respondent falsely certified that the vendee personally appeared before him [5]. This ill-advised act, though arguably involving an "incomplete" instrument, afforded an unscrupulous third party the opportunity to defraud the petitioner [5].

While a member of the bar may be held to account for disgraceful or immoral acts as a notary (*In re Rusiana*), respondent's act suggested a lack of caution rather than culpable malpractice or immorality [6].

Respondent is **REPRIMANDED** and admonished to be more careful hereafter [7].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando, JJ., concurred [7].
