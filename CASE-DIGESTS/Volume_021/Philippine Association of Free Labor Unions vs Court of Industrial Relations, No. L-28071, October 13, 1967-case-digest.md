I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE ASSOCIATION OF FREE LABOR UNIONS (PAFLU) v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, PHILIPPINE LABOR ALLIANCE COUNCIL (PLAC), and PHILIPPINE BLOOMING MILLS COMPANY, G.R. No. L-28071, October 13, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Philippine Labor Alliance Council (PLAC) filed a petition for certification election (CIR Case No. 1859-MC) with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to be declared the sole collective bargaining agent for the workers of Philippine Blooming Mills Company in Pasig, Rizal [1, 2]. On August 29, 1967, the CIR issued an order directing the holding of a certification election under its supervision in both the Pasig and Balintawak plants of the company [1]. Petitioner PAFLU filed an original action for certiorari before the Supreme Court, assailing the CIR's jurisdiction to order and supervise the certification election specifically in the Balintawak plant, and prayed for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a writ of preliminary injunction should be issued to restrain the CIR from conducting the certification election in the Balintawak plant.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court resolved to give due course to the petition for certiorari, noting that the petitioner questioned not only the CIR's jurisdiction to order the election in the Balintawak plant but also its legal authority to supervise it [3, 4]. However, while the Court allowed the petition to proceed for a review of the jurisdictional issue, it specifically **denied** the prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction [3, 4].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred [2].
