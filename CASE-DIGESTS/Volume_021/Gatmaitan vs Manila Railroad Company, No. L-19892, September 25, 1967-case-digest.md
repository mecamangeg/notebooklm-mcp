I. CAPTION
GERONIMO GATMAITAN v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19892, September 25, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Gatmaitan, the Cashier and Assistant Treasurer of respondent Manila Railroad Company, was suspended in 1952 following the discovery of forged treasury warrants. Although temporarily reinstated to a different position, he was suspended again in 1954 after criminal cases for estafa thru falsification were filed against him. The Company’s Board of Directors created a committee to investigate the administrative charges. Gatmaitan appeared before the committee with counsel and submitted a memorandum. Finding him guilty of misconduct, the Board dismissed him from service in 1955. In 1957, the trial court acquitted Gatmaitan in the criminal cases on the ground of reasonable doubt. He demanded reinstatement and back wages, which the Company refused. He filed a complaint, but the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed it.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the administrative investigation satisfied the requirements of due process.
2. W/N the petitioner's acquittal in the criminal cases warrants his reinstatement.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the petitioner was given full opportunity to be heard and defend himself. He appeared before the investigating committee assisted by counsel and, upon the conclusion of the hearings, submitted a lengthy memorandum to the committee [1]. This satisfied the requirements of due process in administrative proceedings.

2. **NO.** The Court held that conviction in a criminal case is not indispensable to warrant the dismissal of an employee; it is enough that the employer has proof of the employee's breach of trust or other sufficient reason (*National Labor Union vs. Standard, etc.*) [2]. Since the petitioner was duly investigated and found guilty of gross negligence and conduct prejudicial to the interest of his employer, his subsequent acquittal based on reasonable doubt did not affect the validity of his previous dismissal [2].

The judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED [3].
