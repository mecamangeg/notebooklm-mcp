I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE AIR LINES, INC. v. MELANIO SALCEDO, PHILIPPINE AIR LINES EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-22119, September 29, 1967, 21 SCRA 372, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Melanio Salcedo, an employee of petitioner Philippine Air Lines (PAL), was dismissed on June 28, 1957, after PAL accused him of qualified theft of ball bearings [1, 2]. Although the City Attorney exonerated Salcedo, PAL refused to reinstate him. Salcedo filed a complaint for reinstatement and damages with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [2, 3]. The CFI ruled in favor of Salcedo, ordering his reinstatement with back wages [4].

On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the CFI decision and dismissed the complaint, giving credence to PAL's witnesses (Abalajon, Calderon, and Cartagena) over Salcedo regarding the theft [5, 6]. Subsequently, Salcedo filed a "Petition for New Trial Based on the Ground of Newly Discovered Evidence," attaching an affidavit from Romulo Matro, a PAL employee. Matro confessed that he, not Salcedo, sold the stolen ball bearings, which were given to him by PAL's own witnesses, Calderon and Cartagena [5, 7]. The CA granted the new trial, vacated its judgment, and remanded the case [8]. PAL petitioned the Supreme Court for review, arguing the evidence was not newly discovered and would not change the result [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals properly granted the motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA resolution, holding that the appellate court did not abuse its discretion [10].

First, the Court found that the respondents were not negligent in securing the evidence. Matro's affidavit was executed only after the CA reversed the trial court's decision, purportedly because Matro was moved by conscience upon seeing Salcedo lose the case. Thus, the evidence could not have been discovered earlier [11].

Second, the Court held that the credibility of the new witness is a question of fact for the CA, which is not reviewable by the Supreme Court [12].

Third, the Court ruled that the new evidence was material and could change the outcome. The case rested on the credibility of PAL's witnesses versus Salcedo. Matro's testimony, which implicated PAL's witnesses (Cartagena and Calderon) as the source of the stolen goods, could seriously impeach their veracity and tip the balance in favor of Salcedo [13, 14]. The Court cited *People v. Saez* and *Tan v. People* to reiterate that the granting or denial of a new trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the court [15, 16].

The resolution of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED [10].
