I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE BANKING CORPORATION v. LUI SHE, G.R. No. L-17587, September 12, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Justina Santos, an elderly, blind, and invalid Filipino woman, owned a parcel of land in Manila [1, 2]. She executed a series of contracts in favor of Wong Heng, a Chinese national, alleged to be in acknowledgment of his personal services to her [3]. These contracts included a 50-year lease (later extended to 99 years) which gave Wong the right to withdraw at any time, and an option to buy the property conditioned on Wong obtaining Filipino citizenship, which prohibited Santos from selling the land to others for 50 years [3-5]. Santos later executed a codicil directing the annulment of these contracts, claiming they were obtained through machinations [5, 6]. She filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Manila to annul the contracts [6]. The trial court declared the original lease valid but annulled the subsequent amendments and options [7]. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court. During the pendency of the appeal, both parties died and were substituted by their respective estates [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lease contract is void for lack of mutuality under Article 1308 of the Civil Code because the lessee was given the right to withdraw at any time.
2. W/N the contracts are void for violating the Constitutional prohibition against alien landholding.
3. W/N the parties are barred from recovering the property under the doctrine of *in pari delicto*.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Article 1308, which states that the validity or compliance of a contract cannot be left to the will of one party, does not prohibit a resolutory condition permitting the cancellation of the contract by one of the parties [9]. The Court held that where parties agree that such an option exists, the exercise of that option is a fulfillment of the contract, not a violation of mutuality [10].

2. **YES.** While a lease to an alien for a reasonable period is generally valid, the Court found that the series of contracts—specifically the 99-year lease combined with a 50-year option to buy which deprived the owner of the right to dispose of the property—constituted a "virtual transfer of ownership" [11, 12]. This arrangement stripped the Filipino owner of the rights of ownership (*jus possidendi, jus utendi, jus fruendi, jus abutendi,* and *jus disponendi*) and consolidated them in the alien, thereby circumventing the Constitutional ban on alien landholding established in *Krivenko v. Register of Deeds* [12, 13].

3. **NO.** Generally, parties in *pari delicto* (equal fault) are left where they are without relief. However, Article 1416 of the Civil Code provides an exception when the agreement is not illegal *per se* but merely prohibited, and the prohibition is designed for the protection of the plaintiff, provided public policy is enhanced by the recovery [13]. The Court ruled that the Constitutional provision conserving lands for Filipinos is a matter of public policy [13]. To preclude recovery would sanction the violation of the Constitution; thus, the land must be restored to the Filipino owner [14].

**Disposition:** The judgment is reversed in part. The contracts are annulled and set aside, and the land is ordered returned to the estate of Justina Santos.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Fernando, J., concurring:**
Justice Fernando emphasized that the *pari delicto* rule has been applied indiscriminately in past alien landholding cases (like *Rellosa*). He argued that applying the doctrine to bar recovery defeats the purpose of the Constitution. He agreed that the property should be restored to the Filipino vendor to give full force to the Constitutional prohibition [15, 16].
