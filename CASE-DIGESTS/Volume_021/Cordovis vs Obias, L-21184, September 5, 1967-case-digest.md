I. CAPTION
SIMEON CORDOVIS, JUAN RUBIA, ET AL. v. BASILISA A. DE OBIAS, ESTRELLA O. ROCHA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21184, September 5, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On January 16, 1957, respondents Basilisa A. de Obias and Hermogenes P. Obias filed a complaint for forcible entry and detainer against petitioners Simeon Cordovis, et al. in the Justice of the Peace Court of Garchitorena, Camarines Sur [1]. The lower court decided against petitioners, who subsequently appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Sur (Civil Case No. 3991) [1]. Upon docketing the appeal, the Clerk of Court sent the notice of the appealed case to the petitioners personally, not to their lawyer [1].

Because petitioners failed to answer, they were declared in default, and on May 4, 1959, the CFI rendered judgment against them [2]. Following the issuance of a writ of execution and a contempt charge for refusal to vacate, petitioners filed a new complaint (Civil Case No. T-7) on September 5, 1962, seeking to annul the judgment in Civil Case No. 3991 [2]. They argued the judgment was void because the notice of appeal should have been sent to their counsel, relying on the ruling in *Elli v. Ditan* [3, 4]. The CFI dismissed the complaint for annulment on January 18, 1963 [3]. Petitioners appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the service of the notice of the appealed case to the parties themselves, instead of their counsel, was proper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that notice of the appealed case sent to the parties themselves, even if represented by counsel, is proper [4].

Under Section 7 of Rule 40 (Rules of Court), when a case is appealed from an inferior court to the CFI, the complaint is deemed reproduced [5]. The proceeding immediately following is the summoning of the defendant; however, since the defendant is already within the court's jurisdiction, he is personally notified instead of summoned, with the notice taking the place of the summons [4].

The Court further explained that while *Elli v. Ditan* (1962) temporarily required notice to counsel, that ruling was abandoned in *Valenzuela v. Balayo* (1963), which reinstated the doctrine in *Ortiz v. Mania* (1953) that notice to parties is sufficient [4, 6]. Moreover, at the time the notice was sent in this case, *Ortiz* was the prevailing doctrine, and the judgment had already become final before *Ditan* was promulgated [4].

The order of dismissal appealed from is hereby affirmed [7].
