I. CAPTION
AGRIPINO DEMAFILES v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, PROVINCIAL BOARD OF ANTIQUE, and BENITO B. GALIDO, G.R. No. L-28396, December 29, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Demafiles and Respondent Galido were candidates for Mayor in the first election of the new municipality of Sebaste, Antique, held on November 14, 1967. Galido requested the Provincial Board of Antique, acting as the Municipal Board of Canvassers, to disregard the return from Precinct 7 as "obviously manufactured" because the return showed 195 registered voters (188 voted), while the municipal election registrar's certificate stated there were only 182 registered voters. The Board, which included two members running for reelection, granted the request, rejected the return, and proclaimed Galido as winner.

Demafiles protested to the COMELEC, challenging the rejection of the return and the qualification of the reelectionist Board members. The COMELEC initially annulled the canvass but later reconsidered and upheld Galido’s proclamation. Demafiles filed a petition for mandamus and certiorari. Galido argued the case was moot because he had already assumed office on November 22 pursuant to RA 4870, which stated the first officials "shall have qualified."

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent Galido’s assumption of office rendered the case moot based on the interpretation of RA 4870.
2. W/N the Board of Canvassers acted within its power in rejecting the election return from Precinct 7.
3. W/N members of the Provincial Board who were candidates for reelection were disqualified from sitting as the Municipal Board of Canvassers.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the phrase "and shall have qualified" in Section 2 of RA 4870 is meaningless and fails to express a legislative intent to allow early assumption of office. Applying the general rule under the Revised Election Code, the term of office begins on January 1 following the election. Galido's earlier assumption was void and did not moot the case [1-3].

2. **NO.** The Board of Canvassers has a purely ministerial function to compile results from returns that are authentic on their face. The return from Precinct 7 was not "obviously manufactured" (unlike in *Lagumbay v. COMELEC*) because it did not show statistical improbabilities on its face. The discrepancy regarding the number of registered voters required evidence *aliunde* (the registrar's certificate) and is a matter to be resolved in an election contest, not during canvassing [3-6].

3. **YES.** Section 28 of the Revised Election Code disqualifies any member of the provincial board who is a candidate for elective office from acting on said board. The law draws no distinction between the board acting as a Provincial Board of Canvassers or as a Municipal Board of Canvassers. Following the maxim *ubi lex non distinguit, nec nos distinguere debemos* (where the law does not distinguish, we should not distinguish), the reelectionist members were disqualified, rendering the canvass and proclamation illegal [7-9].

**Petition GRANTED.** The COMELEC resolutions are set aside. The COMELEC is directed to appoint substitute members for the Board of Canvassers and order a new canvass including Precinct 7 [10].
