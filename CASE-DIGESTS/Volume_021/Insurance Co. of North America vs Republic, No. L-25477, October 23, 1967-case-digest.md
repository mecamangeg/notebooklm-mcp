I. CAPTION
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-25477, October 23, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Insurance Company of North America, acting as insurer and subrogee of the consignee Insular Lumber Company, filed a suit against the Republic of the Philippines to recover P11,355.30 [2]. This amount represented the value of four bundles of tractor parts discharged from the SS "Turandot" into the custody of the Customs Arrastre Service but were subsequently lost and not delivered to the consignee [2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the case on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, ruling that the Republic cannot be sued without its consent and that claims must follow the procedure in Act 3083 and Commonwealth Act 327 [3]. The plaintiff appealed this order to the Supreme Court [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Republic of the Philippines (Customs Arrastre Service) can be sued for the loss of cargo without its consent.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Customs Arrastre Service performs an undertaking that is an incident of a prime governmental function [3, 4]. It is a part of the governmental machinery through which the Republic carries out its activities [3, 4]. Consequently, the Republic may not be sued without its consent [3, 4]. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service* that even if the State could be sued, money claims must be coursed through the General Auditing Office in accordance with Act 3083, as amended by Commonwealth Act 327 [3, 4].

The order of dismissal appealed from is AFFIRMED [5].
