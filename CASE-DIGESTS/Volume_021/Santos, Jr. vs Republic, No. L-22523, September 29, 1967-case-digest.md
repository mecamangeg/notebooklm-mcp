I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MINOR, EDWIN VILLA Y MENDOZA. LUIS E. SANTOS, JR. and EDIPOLA V. SANTOS v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-22523, September 29, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners-spouses Luis E. Santos, Jr. and Edipola V. Santos filed a petition in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Manila to adopt the minor Edwin Villa y Mendoza [1, 2]. Edipola is the elder sister of the minor Edwin; they share the same parents, Francisco Villa and Florencia Mendoza [3, 4]. Edwin, a sickly child since birth, was entrusted to the petitioners who reared him, resulting in a deep bond between them [5]. The petitioners had no children of their own and were financially capable of supporting the minor [4].

The trial court dismissed the petition, reasoning that an adoption would create an "incongruous situation" where the minor would be both the legitimate brother and the son of the petitioner-wife [3]. The petitioners appealed, arguing that no law prohibits such adoption [2, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an elder sister may adopt her younger brother.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that there is no provision in the law prohibiting relatives, by blood or by affinity, from adopting one another [6, 7]. The Court rejected the lower court's concern regarding the "incongruity" of a dual relationship. It held that the dual relationship—one by nature and the other by fiction of law—should not prevent the adoption [8, 9]. The relationship established by adoption is limited to the adopting parents and does not extend to other relatives [9, 10].

The Court emphasized that the interest and welfare of the child are the paramount considerations [8, 11]. Furthermore, the enumeration in Article 338 of the Civil Code (allowing adoption of natural, illegitimate, or step-children) is not exclusive but serves to remove doubt that adoption is permitted in those cases [11]. To restrict adoption only to those cases would preclude adoption among relatives, which is not the policy of the law [7, 11].

The decision appealed from is set aside, and the petition for the adoption of the minor is granted [12].
