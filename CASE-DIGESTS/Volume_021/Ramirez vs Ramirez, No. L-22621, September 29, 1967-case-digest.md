I. CAPTION
JOSE MARIA RAMIREZ v. JOSE EUGENIO RAMIREZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22621, September 29, 1967, 21 SCRA 385, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Jose Maria Ramirez brought an action for the partition of a parcel of land at the corner of Escolta Street and Plaza Sta. Cruz, Manila, which he co-owned *pro indiviso* with the defendants (Jose Eugenio Ramirez, et al.). The plaintiff owned a 1/6 share, while the defendants collectively owned the remaining 5/6 [1]. While some defendants agreed to the partition, others objected, arguing that physical division was legally impossible and would cause "inestimable damage" to the co-owners [2]. The lower court referred the matter to a Commission, which submitted plans for segregation. The trial court ultimately ordered the partition based on the plan of Commissioner Valencia and directed that incidental expenses be paid proportionately by both parties [3]. The objecting defendants appealed, invoking Article 495 of the Civil Code to argue that the property should be sold rather than divided because physical division would render it unserviceable [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the property is legally susceptible of physical division.
2. W/N the incidental expenses of the partition should be borne exclusively by the plaintiff.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the property is susceptible of physical division. The defendants failed to provide evidence that the segregation of the plaintiff's share would cause "inestimable damage" or render the property unserviceable for its intended commercial or residential use, which is the exception provided under Article 495 of the Civil Code [4, 5]. The Court noted that even after segregating the plaintiff's 260.26 square meters, a substantial area of 1,301.34 square meters remained for the defendants in the heart of Manila, and its value would not be impaired to the extent of becoming indivisible [4, 5]. Furthermore, all commissioners, including the one representing the defendants, recommended segregation [6].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the incidental expenses should not be borne exclusively by the plaintiff. Since the segregation of the property inures to the benefit of both the plaintiff (by acquiring his specific share) and the defendants (by defining their remaining share), both parties must defray the incidental expenses proportionately [7].

The decision of the lower court was **AFFIRMED** [7].
