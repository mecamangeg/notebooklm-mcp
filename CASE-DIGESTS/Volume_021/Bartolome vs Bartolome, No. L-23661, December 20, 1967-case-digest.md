I. CAPTION
**JOSE MANANGOL BARTOLOME, ANTONIO BARTOLOME, and ADALAIDA BARTOLOME v. JUSTO BARTOLOME, G.R. No. L-23661, December 20, 1967, 21 SCRA 1324, Concepcion, C.J.**

II. FACTS
Venancio Bartolome died in 1948. In 1955, petitioner Jose Manangol Bartolome filed a petition to administer Venancio's estate, claiming to be a legitimate son of Venancio and Flaviana Fajardo. The court dismissed this, ruling Jose was an illegitimate son of Venancio and Sotera Pangilinan. The estate was subsequently partitioned between Flaviana's estate and respondent Justo Bartolome (Venancio’s brother).

In 1963, Jose, along with Antonio and Adalaida Bartolome, filed a complaint against Justo in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. They sought recognition as acknowledged natural children and their share of the estate, alleging they recently discovered Venancio and Flaviana were never married, making them natural rather than illegitimate children. The CFI dismissed the complaint for lack of cause of action, lack of jurisdiction, and prescription.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the plaintiffs' claim based on continuous possession of status of natural children is valid.
2. W/N the action for compulsory recognition has prescribed.
3. W/N the CFI of Manila has jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Continuous possession of the status of a natural child does not automatically confer the legal status of an *acknowledged* natural child. Under the Civil Code of Spain (the law applicable at the time of Venancio's death in 1948), such possession is merely a ground for an action for compulsory recognition [1, 2]. Since the plaintiffs were not legally acknowledged, they had no successional rights to the estate [2].

2. **YES.** Under Article 137 of the Civil Code of Spain, an action for compulsory recognition must be brought during the lifetime of the presumed parent, or within four years following the attainment of majority if the parent died during the child's minority [3, 4]. Venancio died in 1948. Plaintiffs Jose and Antonio were already of age, barring their action [5]. Plaintiff Adalaida reached majority in 1949, so her four-year period expired long before the 1963 complaint [5].

3. **NO.** Jurisdiction to hear cases for acknowledgment of natural children in Manila is vested *exclusively* in the Court of Juvenile and Domestic Relations, not the CFI, pursuant to Section 38-A of Republic Act No. 1401 [6-8]. Furthermore, causes of action for recognition and recovery of hereditary shares cannot be joined in the CFI as they pertain to different tribunals [8].

**Order affirmed.**
