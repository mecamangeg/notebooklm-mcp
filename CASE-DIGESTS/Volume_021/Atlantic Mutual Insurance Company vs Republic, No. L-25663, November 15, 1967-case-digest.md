I. CAPTION
ATLANTIC MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, BUREAU OF CUSTOMS and UNITED STATES LINES COMPANY, G.R. No. L-25663, November 15, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
In April 1964, 43 cases of Globe Leather were shipped from New York on board the SS "Pioneer Mart" of the United States Lines Company, consigned to Crown Embroidery Corporation in Manila [1]. The shipment was discharged to the Bureau of Customs, which was then acting as the arrastre operator [1]. When delivered to the consignee, a large portion of the goods was found damaged. Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company, as the insurer, paid the consignee $3,855.97 and, as subrogee, filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against the Republic of the Philippines, the Bureau of Customs, and alternatively, United States Lines Company [2].

The Republic and the Bureau of Customs moved to dismiss the case on the grounds of state immunity and failure to file a claim with the Auditor General under Act 3083 and Commonwealth Act 327 [3]. United States Lines did not file a motion to dismiss but answered denying liability and filing a cross-claim against the Bureau of Customs [3]. The CFI dismissed the complaint in its entirety, ruling that the claim should have been lodged with the Auditor General [4]. Atlantic Mutual appealed, arguing its unliquidated claim required judicial appreciation of evidence [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs can be sued for claims arising from arrastre operations.
2. W/N the dismissal of the complaint against United States Lines Company was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Arrastre operations, when performed by the Bureau of Customs, are a "necessary incident of the prime governmental function of taxation"—specifically the assessment and collection of lawful revenues, tariffs, and fees [5]. Relying on *Mobil Philippines Exploration v. Customs Arrastre Service*, the Court held that this activity is protected from suit by reason of public policy, and the Bureau is immune from suit [5]. Even if the claim involves unliquidated damages requiring discretion in appreciating evidence, the Republic or its agencies cannot be sued without their consent [5]. If the claim falls under Act 3083 and CA 327, it must be presented to the Auditor General [5].

2. **NO.** United States Lines Company did not file a motion to dismiss [6]. The CFI's dismissal order was premised entirely on the non-suability of the Republic and the Bureau of Customs [6]. Since Atlantic Mutual sued the parties in the alternative, a fair interpretation of the rules dictates that the dismissal regarding the government entities should not extend to the private carrier [6].

The dismissal order is **AFFIRMED** as to the Republic and the Bureau of Customs, but the case is **REMANDED** for further proceedings against United States Lines Company [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles and Fernando, JJ., concurred) [7].
