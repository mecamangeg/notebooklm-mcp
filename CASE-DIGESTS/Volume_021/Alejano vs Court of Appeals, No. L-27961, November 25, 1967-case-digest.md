I. CAPTION
SOCORRO V. ALEJANO, ET AL. v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS and LUIS G. JALECO, G.R. No. L-27961, November 25, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Alejano sought a reconsideration of the Supreme Court's Resolution dated September 28, 1967, which denied their petition for review on certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision [1]. Petitioners argued that the denial deprived them of redress for substantial errors of law committed by the lower courts, specifically regarding a declaration of default and alleged violation of due process [2].

In the underlying case, the trial court declared petitioners in default [3]. Petitioners claimed they did not receive summons [4]. However, the CA found that petitioners' counsel had filed a motion to dismiss the second cause of action [4]. The CA ruled this constituted voluntary appearance, submitting them to the court's jurisdiction even if summons were not received, especially since they were allowed to present evidence during trial [5]. Petitioners contended the Supreme Court should not have denied their petition without stating the reasons for the denial [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court is required to state the reasons for denying a petition for review on certiorari.
2. W/N the petition raised questions of law warranting review by the Supreme Court.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that there is no need to state the reasons for the denial of a petition for review on certiorari where a "careful perusal of the petition and the decision of the Court of Appeals sought to be reviewed indicate quite unmistakably that the question raised are factual in character" [3, 6].

2. **NO.** The Court found that the errors assigned by the petitioners were factual in nature, despite attempts to dress them in legal terminology [7]. The first error regarding the default order and jurisdiction was negated by the CA's factual finding that petitioners voluntarily appeared through counsel, curing any defect in the service of summons [5]. The second error regarding the sufficiency of evidence to prove the mortgage was without consideration and violated the Usury Law was also "inherently factual" [8]. The Supreme Court does not review essentially factual matters [7].

The Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED** [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Concepcion, C.J., and Reyes, J.B.L., J., were on official leave) [9].
