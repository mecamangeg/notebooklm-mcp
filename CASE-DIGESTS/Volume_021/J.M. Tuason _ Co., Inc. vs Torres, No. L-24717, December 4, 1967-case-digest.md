I. CAPTION
J. M. TUASON & CO., INC. v. HON. GUILLERMO E. TORRES, MACARIA FULGENCIO, PLACIDO PASCUAL, ET AL., G.R. No. L-24717, December 4, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
In 1953, J.M. Tuason & Co. and the Deudors (and their vendees) entered into a Compromise Agreement regarding ownership of 50 *quiñones* of land in Tatalon, Quezon City. This agreement was approved by the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, Branch IV, sitting at Quezon City, in a decision dated April 10, 1953, which became final and executory [1, 2].

Years later, on February 11, 1965, respondents Fulgencio and other Deudor vendees filed Civil Case No. 8559 in the CFI of Rizal, Branch III, sitting at Pasig (presided by respondent Judge Torres). They sought to annul the 1953 decision of the CFI Quezon City (Branch IV), enjoin its execution, and declare the Tuasons' titles void [3]. Petitioner Tuason moved to dismiss on the ground that the CFI Pasig lacked jurisdiction to annul a final decision of the CFI Quezon City. Judge Torres denied the motion and issued preliminary injunctions against the petitioner [3]. The petitioner filed for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CFI of Pasig (Branch III) has jurisdiction to annul or enjoin the execution of a final judgment rendered by a co-equal branch, the CFI of Quezon City (Branch IV).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the jurisdiction to annul a judgment of a branch of the Court of First Instance belongs solely to the very same branch which rendered the judgment [4].

The Court emphasized that any other branch, even if it belongs to the same judicial district (like the CFI Pasig and CFI Quezon City), that attempts to annul such judgment either exceeds its jurisdiction (citing *Cabigao v. Del Rosario*) or acts with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction (citing *P.N.B. v. Javellana*) [4]. Consequently, certiorari and prohibition are proper remedies to prevent the attempting branch from proceeding [4].

The petition is granted; the CFI of Pasig is ordered to permanently desist from acting in Civil Case No. 8559, and the preliminary injunction is made permanent [5].
