I. CAPTION
FELIX LOMUGDANG (Deceased) v. PATERNO JAVIER; PABLO PE ALOLOD (Intervenor), G.R. No. L-27535, September 30, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In the November 12, 1963 elections for Municipal Mayor of Culasi, Antique, the Board of Canvassers proclaimed Paterno Javier the winner over Felix Lomugdang [1, 2]. Lomugdang filed an election protest on May 30, 1966 [2]. Javier filed a counter-protest covering 22 precincts, alleging errors in the returns, but the ballots in these precincts (except Precinct 4) had already been burned pursuant to Section 157 of the Revised Election Code [3]. Javier sought to present *evidence aliunde* consisting of voter testimony to support his counter-protest [3].

Before the hearing, Lomugdang died [4]. Javier moved to dismiss the protest, while Vice-Mayor elect Pablo Pe Alolod moved to intervene, arguing he would succeed to the office if Lomugdang was declared the winner [4]. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, allowed the intervention, and rejected Javier's offer of *evidence aliunde* reasoning that allowing 4,000 voters to testify would violate ballot secrecy and delay proceedings [5, 6]. The court eventually declared Lomugdang the winner and held Alolod entitled to assume the office [7]. Javier appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the election protest should be dismissed due to the death of the protestant.
2. W/N the Vice-Mayor has the right to intervene in the election protest.
3. W/N *evidence aliunde* (testimony of voters) is admissible to prove votes in precincts where ballots were destroyed.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The determination of the true winner in an election is a matter of public interest [8]. Public policy demands that an election contest duly commenced is not abated by the death of the contestant [8]. The Court relied on *Sibulo Vda. de Mesa v. Judge Mencias*, ruling that neither death, ineligibility, nor cessation in office warrants dismissal [8].

2. **YES.** Under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 2264, the Vice-Mayor elect is a real party in interest and is entitled to intervene [9]. If the protest succeeds and the protestee is unseated, the office of the mayor becomes vacant, and the Vice-Mayor succeeds to said office [9].

3. **NO.** To allow 4,000 voters to reveal who they voted for would amount to holding a new election without the secrecy essential to public policy and freedom of choice [6, 10]. Furthermore, the presentation of such a volume of witnesses would cause unmanageable delays, preventing a decision before the term expired [11]. The Court distinguished this from *Salvani v. Garduño*, noting that *Salvani* involved only one precinct, whereas this case involved practically all precincts in the municipality [10].

Decision affirmed.
