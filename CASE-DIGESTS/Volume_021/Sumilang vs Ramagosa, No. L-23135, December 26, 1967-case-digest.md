**I. CAPTION**
TESTATE ESTATE OF HILARION RAMAGOSA. MARIANO SUMILANG v. SATURNINA RAMAGOSA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23135, December 26, 1967, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
On July 5, 1960, Mariano Sumilang filed a petition for the probate of a document alleged to be the last will of Hilarion Ramagosa, who died in 1959. The will instituted Sumilang as the sole heir [1]. Saturnina Ramagosa and others opposed the petition, moving for its dismissal on the ground of implied revocation. They alleged that the testator had sold the properties described in the will to Sumilang and his brother prior to his death, thereby revoking the will [2]. Sumilang moved to strike out the opposition, arguing that the oppositors were strangers to the deceased and lacked legal standing [3]. The Court of First Instance denied the oppositors' motion to dismiss, ruling that the grounds alleged went to the intrinsic validity of the will. However, the court granted Sumilang's motion to strike, finding that the oppositors had no relationship with the deceased within the fifth degree and were thus total strangers [4]. The oppositors appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petition for probate should be dismissed based on the alleged implied revocation of the will.
2. W/N the oppositors have the legal personality to intervene in the probate proceedings.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that in probate proceedings, the court's area of inquiry is strictly limited to the **extrinsic validity** of the will—specifically, the testamentary capacity of the testator and compliance with formal requisites [5]. Any inquiry into the intrinsic validity or the efficacy of testamentary provisions is premature [6]. The alleged revocation implied from the sale of properties relates to the descent and distribution (intrinsic validity), not to the execution of the document (probate) [7].

2. **NO.** To be allowed to intervene in a probate proceeding, a person must have an interest in the estate, either as an heir or a creditor who would be benefited by it [8]. The lower court found the oppositors to be "totally strangers" to the deceased, having no relationship within the fifth degree, a finding the oppositors did not contradict [9]. Consequently, they have no legal interest to protect and no personality to intervene [10, 11].

The Order of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [12].
