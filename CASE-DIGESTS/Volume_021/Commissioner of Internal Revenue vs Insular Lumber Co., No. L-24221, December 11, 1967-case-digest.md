I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. INSULAR LUMBER COMPANY and COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-24221, December 11, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Insular Lumber Company, a corporation licensed to do business in the Philippines, purchased refined oils and fuels from Standard-Vacuum Oil Co. in 1958. Standard-Vacuum paid the specific tax imposed by Section 142 of the Tax Code before removal of the oils. Insular Lumber subsequently used these oils in its logging operations during the same year, 1958 [1]. Pursuant to Section 5 of Republic Act No. 1435, which allows miners and forest concessionaires a 25% refund of specific taxes paid on oils used in their operations, Insular Lumber filed a claim for refund with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) on February 23, 1961 [2]. This was followed by a petition for review in the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) on February 17, 1962 [3]. The CIR opposed the claim, arguing it was filed beyond the two-year prescriptive period under Sections 306 and 309 of the Tax Code [4]. Insular Lumber contended that these sections apply only to taxes erroneously or illegally collected, not to taxes legally collected that became refundable due to a supervening cause (actual use in operations) [5]. The CTA ruled in favor of Insular Lumber.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the claim for refund has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CTA decision and dismissed the petition for refund on the ground of prescription. The Court held that Sections 306 and 309 of the National Internal Revenue Code are mandatory and intended to govern all kinds of refunds of internal revenue taxes, regardless of the conditions under which payment was made [6].

While the tax here was initially collected legally, the Court established that in such cases, the two-year prescriptive period under Section 306 commences **not from the date the tax was paid, but from the happening of the supervening cause** which entitled the taxpayer to a refund [7], [8]. In this case, the supervening cause was the *use* of the oils and fuels in Insular Lumber's logging operations in 1958 [9]. Since the administrative claim was filed in 1961 and the judicial action in 1962—both more than two years after the 1958 usage—the right to claim the refund had prescribed [9]. The Court noted that applying the ten-year prescriptive period of the Civil Code would handicap the Commissioner, as taxpayers are only required to keep records for five years, and would violate public policy requiring expeditious tax adjustments [10], [11]. The ruling in *Muller & Phipps* was modified accordingly [8].
