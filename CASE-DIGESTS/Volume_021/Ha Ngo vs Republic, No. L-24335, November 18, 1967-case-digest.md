**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. HO NGO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-24335, November 18, 1967, Castro, J.

**II. FACTS**
On June 22, 1960, the Court of First Instance of Manila granted Ho Ngo’s petition for naturalization [1]. On June 27, 1963, Ho filed a motion to take his oath as a Filipino citizen [1]. The Republic filed an opposition and motion to dismiss, arguing the petition was fatally defective [1]. The trial court denied Ho’s motion on December 15, 1964, prompting this appeal [1, 2]. The opposition was based on Ho’s failure to state previous residences (Alabat, Mandaluyong, and Caloocan), the omission of his aliases ("Wong Sing" and "Cheng") in the publication of the petition, and the insufficiency of his income [2-4]. Ho earned an average of P667.00 monthly to support a wife and eight children, excluding bonuses [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the failure to state previous places of residence is a fatal defect.
2. W/N the omission of aliases in the publication of the petition affects the court's jurisdiction.
3. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or profession.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The failure to state previous places of residence is a fatal defect that affects the very jurisdiction of the lower court [2]. This jurisdictional issue may be raised at any stage of the proceedings, including the hearing on the motion to take the oath [2].

2. **YES.** The omission of aliases (which were used without judicial authority in violation of the Anti-Alias Law) in the publication of the petition adversely affects the validity of the naturalization proceedings [3]. Such omission constitutes a serious impediment to the grant of naturalization and impairs the jurisdiction of the lower court [3].

3. **NO.** The petitioner does not have a lucrative income. Bonuses are excluded from the calculation because they are contingent, accidental, and spring from the voluntary actuations of the employer [4]. With an average monthly income of P667.00 to support a wife and eight children (six of whom are in school), the petitioner can only meet the bare necessities of life [4]. To be considered lucrative, there must be an appreciable margin of income over expenses to provide for adequate support in the event of unemployment or sickness [5].

The Order of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [6].
