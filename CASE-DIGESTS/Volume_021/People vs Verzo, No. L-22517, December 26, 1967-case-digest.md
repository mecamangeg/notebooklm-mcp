I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GETULIO VERZO, REYNALDO VERZO and ROBERTO VERZO, G.R. No. L-22517, December 26, 1967, 21 SCRA 1403, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On July 6, 1962, in Labo, Camarines Norte, Filemon Casis was riding his bicycle when Getulio Verzo threw a stone at him. Benjamin Camino, a former policeman, witnessed this and advised Filemon to report to the authorities. As they proceeded to the municipal building, they were met by Policeman Lope Jariel. When Camino asked Getulio why he stoned Filemon, Getulio retreated into his house and immediately re-emerged with his sons, Reynaldo and Roberto, all armed with bolos. Despite warning shots and verbal orders from Policeman Jariel to desist, the three accused attacked Camino, who was unarmed and attempting to flee, inflicting fatal wounds. They then turned on Filemon, wounding him. The defense claimed a drunken brawl initiated by Camino, but the trial court found this version "artificious." The Court of First Instance convicted the accused of Murder and sentenced them to death, leading to this automatic review.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused are criminally liable for murder based on conspiracy.
2. W/N the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength was present.
3. W/N the aggravating circumstance of insult to public authorities should be appreciated given the presence of a policeman.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the facts left no room for doubt that the defendants were united in their purpose and execution. Conspiracy was established by their simultaneous emergence from the house brandishing bolos, their concerted attack on Camino despite his attempt to flee and the warning shots from the policeman, and their subsequent joint attack on Filemon Casis [1]. Proof of motive was not indispensable as the identity of the culprits was clear and established by credible witnesses [2].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that abuse of superior strength qualified the killing to murder. This was manifest where the three defendants were wielding bolos, while the victim, Camino, was unarmed and trying to flee [3].

3. **NO.** The Court ruled that the crime cannot be said to have been committed in contempt of or with insult to public authorities simply because Policeman Jariel was present. A policeman is merely an agent of a person in authority, not a person in authority himself, under the Revised Penal Code [3].

Accordingly, as no other modifying circumstances attended the commission of the crime (treachery was doubtful and the mitigating circumstances invoked were not proven), the penalty was modified from death to the medium period, which is life imprisonment. The decision was **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the penalty is reduced to life imprisonment and the civil indemnity increased to P6,000.00 [4], [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
