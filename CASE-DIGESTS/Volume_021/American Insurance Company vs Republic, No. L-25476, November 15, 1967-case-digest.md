I. CAPTION
AMERICAN INSURANCE COMPANY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-25476, November 15, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
American Insurance Company, a New Jersey corporation licensed to do business in the Philippines and subrogee of the consignee San Miguel Brewery, filed a collection suit against the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs. The suit sought to recover P3,243.23 representing the value of one case of steel transmission chains imported from England via SS “Demodocus” which the Bureau of Customs failed to deliver. The City Court of Manila ordered the defendants to pay the amount. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the case, ruling that the Bureau of Customs had no juridical capacity to sue or be sued and that the Republic may not be sued without its consent. The petitioner appealed directly to the Supreme Court on this point of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs can be sued for the loss of cargo while performing arrastre services.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Bureau of Customs performs arrastre services only as an incident to a prime governmental function—that of assessing and collecting revenues from imported articles, tariff and customs duties, fees, charges, fines, and penalties [1, 2]. Because these operations are governmental in nature, they do not render the Republic or its agencies subject to suit without its consent [1, 3]. The Court relied on the doctrine laid down in *Mobil Philippines Exploration v. Customs Arrastre Service* [3]. The judgment of the Court of First Instance is affirmed [4].
