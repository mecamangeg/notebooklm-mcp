I. CAPTION
Tabacalera Insurance Company v. Manila Railroad Company and/or Manila Port Service, G.R. No. L-23636, October 31, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On June 6, 1961, 2,825 bags of glue and hardener were shipped from Antwerp to Manila on the SS "Leverkusen," consigned to Sta. Clara Lumber Co., Inc. and insured by Tabacalera Insurance Company. The vessel arrived on July 11, 1961, and the cargo was discharged to the custody of the arrastre operators, Manila Railroad Company (MRR) and Manila Port Service (MPS), on July 13, 1961 [1]. On July 14, 1961, the broker filed a "provisional claim" for damage and shortage with the MPS, without specifying the value of the loss [1], [2]. Delivery was completed on July 20, 1961, with a shortage of 33 bags [3], [4].

Tabacalera, as subrogee, filed a formal claim on September 25, 1961, for P1,117.64 (CIF value) [3]. When payment was refused, Tabacalera filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, suing alternatively the carrier (admiralty) and the arrastre operators (MRR/MPS) [5]. The CFI ordered MRR and MPS to pay P1,117.64 plus attorney's fees [6]. MRR and MPS appealed, arguing that: (1) the CFI lacked jurisdiction over them as the claim was below P5,000; (2) the claim was barred because the provisional claim was defective and the formal claim was late; and (3) liability should be limited to the invoice value [6], [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CFI has jurisdiction over an arrastre claim below the jurisdictional amount when joined with an admiralty claim in the alternative.
2. W/N a provisional claim filed within 15 days but without specifying the value of the loss constitutes substantial compliance with the Management Contract.
3. W/N the arrastre operator's liability is limited to the invoice value of the goods rather than the CIF value.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The joinder of alternative causes of action is expressly sanctioned by Section 5, Rule 2 and Section 13, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court. Where a plaintiff sues defendants alternatively because they are uncertain whether the loss occurred during transit (admiralty) or during the arrastre service (deposit), the case may be filed in the Court of First Instance if any of the causes of action—such as the admiralty claim—falls within its jurisdiction, even if the claim against the arrastre operator is within the exclusive jurisdiction of a lower court [8], [9].

2. **YES.** The filing of a provisional claim within 15 days from the discharge of goods is sufficient compliance with Section 15 of the Management Contract [10]. The failure to specify the value of the loss in the provisional claim is not a defense, as the consignee must be given a reasonable opportunity to examine the goods and determine the extent of the loss. The purpose of the claim is to afford the operator a reasonable opportunity to check the validity of the claim while facts are fresh [10].

3. **YES.** The Management Contract explicitly limits liability to the "invoice value of the goods which in no case shall be more than P500.00 per package." This stipulation is plain and literal. Consequently, the award based on the CIF value (P1,117.64) was incorrect and must be reduced to the invoice value of the lost goods, which is P1,051.28 [11].

The judgment is **AFFIRMED** with the modification that the award is reduced to P1,051.28 [12].
