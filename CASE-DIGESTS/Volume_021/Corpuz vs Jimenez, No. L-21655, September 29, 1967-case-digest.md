I. CAPTION
FERNANDO CORPUZ v. HON. DAMIAN L. JIMENEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21655, September 29, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In May 1958, J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. filed a complaint for ejectment against Fernando Corpuz in the Municipal Court of Quezon City for illegally occupying a portion of their land [1]. Corpuz failed to appear at the trial, resulting in a judgment ordering him to vacate the premises [1]. After the judgment became final and a writ of execution was issued, Corpuz filed a petition for certiorari or relief from judgment in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal (Civil Action No. Q-4916) to annul the lower court's decision [2]. The CFI denied the petition on March 22, 1960 [1].

Corpuz appealed to the Court of Appeals. During the proceedings, the appellee filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that Corpuz had voluntarily vacated the premises, removing his house and other constructions, which rendered the issues moot and academic [3]. The Court of Appeals directed Corpuz to answer the motion, but he failed to file any response [3]. The case was subsequently certified to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed due to the appellant's failure to answer the motion to dismiss based on mootness.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the appellant's failure to answer the motion for dismissal filed by the appellee—specifically on the ground that the issues had become moot and academic—must be taken as an implied acquiescence to said motion [4, 5].

Consequently, the appeal was dismissed [5].
