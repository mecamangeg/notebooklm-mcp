I. CAPTION
CEBU PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-18649, December 29, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the Supreme Court's decision, arguing that the Court misconstrued the issues by ruling that cement is a manufactured product not subject to *ad valorem* tax [1]. The CIR prayed that the Court declare cement a mineral product subject to a 1 1/2% *ad valorem* tax based on its selling price, or alternatively, subject to a 7% sales tax [2]. The Court clarified that it did not rule on the liability for sales tax as it was never litigated [3]. The central dispute remained on the proper basis for the *ad valorem* tax.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the *ad valorem* tax should be computed based on the selling price of the finished cement product.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the *ad valorem* tax is a severance tax, which is a charge upon the privilege of severing or extracting minerals from the earth [3, 4]. Under Section 245 of the Tax Code, this tax is due and payable upon the removal of the mineral product from its bed or mine [3]. Therefore, the tax must be computed based on the market value of the mineral in its condition at the time of removal and before being substantially changed by chemical or manufacturing processes [3]. While cement is composed of minerals, it is the result of a definite process (crushing, mixing, calcining) and is no longer in the primitive state of mineral products contemplated by the law for *ad valorem* tax purposes [5, 6].

The Motions for Reconsideration are denied [7].
