I. CAPTION
Luis Enguerra v. Antonio Dolosa, G.R. No. L-23233, September 28, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Luis Enguerra worked as a chief baker for defendant Antonio Dolosa's bakery. On December 14, 1961, Enguerra filed a complaint for unpaid overtime against Dolosa in the Municipal Court of Sorsogon. After the Municipal Court dismissed it, Enguerra appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Sorsogon, docketed as Civil Case No. 1800 [1, 2].

While Case No. 1800 was pending, Enguerra filed another complaint (Civil Case No. 1804) against Dolosa on January 24, 1963, claiming damages and other violations arising from the same employment [2, 3]. On February 6, 1963, the CFI granted Dolosa a 30-day extension "counted from to-day" to file an answer. On March 8, 1963, Dolosa filed a Motion to Dismiss Case No. 1804 on the ground that Case No. 1800 was pending between the same parties for the same cause of action (splitting a cause of action) [4]. Enguerra moved to declare Dolosa in default, arguing the motion was filed one day late and was merely *pro forma*. The CFI granted the dismissal and denied the motion for default [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Motion to Dismiss was filed within the reglementary period.
2. W/N the Motion to Dismiss was *pro forma*.
3. W/N the filing of the second complaint constituted splitting a cause of action.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Rule 28 of the Rules of Court, the method of computation is "exclude-the-first and include-the-last day" [5, 6]. The 30-day extension granted on February 6 excluded that day, meaning the period commenced on February 7. Counting 30 days, the deadline was March 8. Since Dolosa filed the motion on March 8, it was within the period [6, 7].

2. **NO.** A motion to dismiss is not *pro forma* when it explicitly states the legal grounds and the particular facts upon which those grounds rely [8, 9]. Dolosa’s motion specified the title, number, and court of the pending case (Case No. 1800) and the violation of the rule against splitting a cause of action. Consequently, the motion was valid and suspended the running of the period to file an answer [9].

3. **YES.** The alleged violations in both cases (underpayment, overtime, damages, etc.) sprang from one and the same breach of the employment contract [3, 10]. Statutory provisions on wages and damages are part of the employment contract, and a plaintiff cannot file separate complaints for different effects of a single breach [11]. Since the cause of action was single, Enguerra was barred from instituting a separate suit for claims that should have been included in the first action [11, 12].

**The order of dismissal is affirmed.**
