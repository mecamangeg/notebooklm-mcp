I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. MALAYAN INSURANCE COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-21913, November 18, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In 1958, respondent Malayan Insurance Company, Inc. (Malayan), a domestic corporation, ceded reinsurance premiums amounting to P64,327.36 to Orion Insurance Company, Ltd. (Orion), a non-resident foreign corporation in London. Malayan filed an income tax return for Orion and paid P958.00. Later, Malayan discovered that Orion had authorized another domestic entity, Filipinas Compana de Seguros (Filipinas), to file the return, which Filipinas did, paying P778.00. Malayan requested a refund of its P958.00 payment. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) demanded that Malayan pay P15,416.96 in withholding tax on the premiums ceded to Orion. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ordered the refund to Malayan and dismissed the CIR’s counterclaim for withholding tax, ruling that the demand should be made on Filipinas as Orion’s authorized representative. The CIR appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Malayan is liable for withholding tax on reinsurance premiums ceded to a non-resident foreign corporation despite the payment of income tax by the latter's local agent.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Under Section 53(b) of the National Internal Revenue Code, the obligation to withhold tax is broad, all-embracing, and compulsory. It covers the receipt, control, or custody of fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, such as reinsurance premiums, belonging to a non-resident alien not doing business in the Philippines [1, 2]. The law makes the withholding agent *personally* liable for the payment of the tax to ensure the government can collect taxes from aliens outside its jurisdiction [2, 3].

The Court held that the CIR's cause of action against Malayan is not for the collection of income tax, but for the enforcement of the withholding provision, compliance with which is imposed on the withholding agent and *not* the taxpayer [4]. Consequently, the payment of income tax by Filipinas (Orion's agent) did not relieve Malayan of its legal duty to withhold. Furthermore, the agency authority of Filipinas was limited; it did not bind Orion to pay the tax based on the return, nor did it allow the agent to claim refunds, underscoring the necessity of the withholding system [5, 6].

The petition is granted. The decision is **MODIFIED**; the dismissal of the CIR's counterclaim is reversed, and Malayan is ordered to pay the withholding tax on the reinsurance premiums, crediting the P958.00 previously paid [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
