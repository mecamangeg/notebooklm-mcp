**I. CAPTION**
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and/or LUZON BROKERAGE CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-27516, October 19, 1967, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Insurance Company of North America (plaintiff-appellant) filed a suit against the Republic of the Philippines, as arrastre operator, and/or Luzon Brokerage Corporation to recover P13,616.06 in losses and damages, plus interest and attorney's fees, relating to imported cargo. Luzon Brokerage had taken custody of the cargo from the Republic and delivered it to the consignee [1].

On February 13, 1967, the Court of First Instance of Manila issued a pre-trial order sustaining the Republic's plea of non-suability and dismissed the case against it. The plaintiff appealed this order to the Supreme Court [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Republic of the Philippines may be sued for the claim without its consent.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. The Court applied the unwavering rule of jurisprudence that in a claim—whether liquidated or unliquidated—against the State, the latter may not be sued without its consent. The Court relied on *Equitable vs. Smith Bell* (L-24383) and *Insurance Co. vs. Republic* (L-26532) in upholding the doctrine of State immunity [2].

The order of the lower court was affirmed, with costs against the plaintiff [2].
