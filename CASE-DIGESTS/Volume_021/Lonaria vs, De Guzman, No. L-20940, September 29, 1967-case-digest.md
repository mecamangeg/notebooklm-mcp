I. CAPTION
BERNARDO LONARIA v. JUDGE PASTOR L. DE GUZMAN and FORTUNATA SANTIAGO, G.R. No. L-20940, September 29, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lonaria was the tenant of respondent Santiago. In a case before the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR), Judge De Guzman issued an order on November 26, 1962, requiring Lonaria to pay an increased yearly rental of P225.00 [1, 2].

On November 28, 1962, Lonaria filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR), arguing the decision contradicted the evidence and defenses [2]. This was denied on December 26, 1962, and Lonaria received the notice of denial on January 4, 1963 [2, 3]. On January 18, 1963, Lonaria’s counsel received a formal copy of the November 26 order [4]. Subsequently, on January 22, 1963, Lonaria filed a second MR, which was denied on February 9, 1963 [2]. After receiving the second denial on February 21, Lonaria filed the instant petition for review on February 22, 1963 [4]. Respondent Santiago moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing the 15-day reglementary period had expired [5, 6]. Lonaria contended the period should be counted from his actual receipt of the order on January 18, 1963, not from the earlier dates [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal was perfected within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition for being filed out of time. Under Section 4, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, appeals from the CAR must be brought within 15 days from notice of the order [8].

While the period generally runs from the receipt of a copy of the decision, the Court held that the period for appeal commenced upon the filing of the first MR on November 28, 1962 [9]. By filing the MR, the petitioner demonstrated he had knowledge of the order; thus, he waived his right to have the period counted from the formal receipt of the order on January 18, 1963 [7]. The purpose of the notice rule—to ensure the party has knowledge to take proper steps—was already fulfilled [10].

The running of the period was suspended by the first MR but resumed on January 4, 1963, when petitioner received the notice of denial [9]. From January 4 to January 22, 1963 (the filing of the second MR), 18 days had elapsed, exceeding the 15-day limit [9, 11]. Furthermore, the second MR did not suspend the period because it was *pro forma* (based on grounds available during the first motion) and because the period had already lapsed [9, 12]. Consequently, the judgment became final and the petition was dismissed [13, 14].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Concepcion, Dizon, Makalintal, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred. Justice J.B.L. Reyes reserved his vote. Justice Bengzon, J.P. was on leave [14, 15].
