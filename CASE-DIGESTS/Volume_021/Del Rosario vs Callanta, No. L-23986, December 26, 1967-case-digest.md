I. CAPTION
ERNESTO DEL ROSARIO, CELSO CABRERA, MATIAS L. MARBELLA, PEDRO AMAGUIN, and SANTIAGO PANGAN v. THE HON. JACINTO CALLANTA, Presiding Judge, Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte, and THE PROVINCIAL FISCAL OF ILOCOS NORTE, G.R. No. L-23986, December 26, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On August 29, 1962, the *Manila Chronicle* published a news item titled "8 in Ilocos Robbery Held," which mentioned Glicerio Parado, a lawyer, as a suspect in a robbery [1]. On September 1, 1962, Parado filed a complaint for libel against the petitioners (editors of the newspaper) before the Justice of the Peace Court of Dingras, Ilocos Norte [2]. Subsequently, the Provincial Fiscal filed an Information in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Ilocos Norte [3].

On October 2, 1964, the petitioners filed a motion to dismiss, arguing lack of jurisdiction and prescription [4]. They contended that the Information failed to allege that the offended party resided in Ilocos Norte or that the article was published there—essential venue elements for libel—stating instead that publication was in Manila [4]. The Fiscal amended the Information on October 26, 1964, to allege residence in Dingras, but petitioners argued the two-year prescriptive period from the 1962 publication had already lapsed because the original defective proceedings did not interrupt it [5, 6]. The respondent Judge denied the motion to dismiss [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the complaint filed in the Justice of the Peace Court was sufficient to confer jurisdiction and interrupt the prescriptive period despite lacking specific averments of venue in its body.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the complaint was sufficient to confer jurisdiction and interrupt prescription. Under *People v. Olarte*, the filing of a complaint in the Municipal Court interrupts the period of prescription for criminal responsibility [6].

Although the body of the original complaint did not specifically aver that the complainant was a resident of Ilocos Norte or that publication occurred there, an affidavit executed by the complainant was attached to the complaint [7]. This affidavit, sworn before the Justice of the Peace on the same date the complaint was filed, stated that the complainant was a resident of Dingras, Ilocos Norte, and that the news item was read there [7]. The Court ruled that facts charged in a complaint may be "amplified or qualified by others appearing to be additional circumstances" in the records or admissions [8]. Since these essential facts were part of the record and known to the Justice of the Peace, the court properly acquired jurisdiction, and the filing of the complaint validly interrupted the prescriptive period [7].

Petition dismissed [9].
