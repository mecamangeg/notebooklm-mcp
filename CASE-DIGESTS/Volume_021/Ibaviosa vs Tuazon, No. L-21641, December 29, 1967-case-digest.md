I. CAPTION
MANUEL IBAVIOSA v. BENIGNO TUAZON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21641, December 29, 1967, 21 SCRA 1439, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Benigno Tuazon was a share tenant of petitioner Manuel Ibaviosa on a riceland in Jaen, Nueva Ecija. On February 20, 1960, Tuazon sent a registered letter to Ibaviosa desiring to change their tenancy relationship to leasehold effective the 1960-1961 agricultural year. Ibaviosa’s son, Constante, replied denying the request. On October 20, 1960, Tuazon filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). Ibaviosa challenged the court's jurisdiction, arguing he did not personally receive the notice and that the petition was filed late for the 1960-1961 agricultural year (which began in June/July). The CAR ruled in favor of Tuazon but made the leasehold system effective starting the agricultural year 1963-1964, not 1960-1961. Ibaviosa appealed, questioning the validity of the notice and the constitutionality of the law allowing the change.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the tenant’s notice for a change of tenancy system was validly served and timely.
2. W/N Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199 (Agricultural Tenancy Act) is constitutional.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the factual findings of the CAR. Regarding service, Ibaviosa admitted in court that his son Constante acted as his representative in dealing with tenants [1]. Regarding timeliness, while the petition was filed in October 1960, the CAR decision made the change effective only beginning the agricultural year 1963-1964 [2]. Therefore, the requirement of the law regarding at least one month notice prior to the effectivity of the change was duly complied with [2].

2. **YES.** The Court held that Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199, which provides for a change in tenancy relationship, is constitutional. The Court relied on a long line of decisions, specifically citing *Primero v. CAR* [3], settling the validity of this provision.

The decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations is affirmed.
