I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE EDUCATION COMPANY, INC. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-24091, September 20, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Philippine Education Company, Inc. (plaintiff) was the consignee of a shipment of 202 bundles of magazines which arrived in Manila on board the "SS President McKinley." The cargo was discharged into the custody of Manila Port Service (MPS), the arrastre operator, on January 8, 1961. When the plaintiff took delivery, 35 bundles were missing [1, 2]. The plaintiff filed a provisional claim on January 11, 1961, and a formal claim on August 26, 1961 [2].

On January 19, 1962, the plaintiff filed a complaint for recovery of the value of the missing goods [3]. The lower court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, ordering MPS to pay P1,089.15. MPS appealed, arguing that the provisional claim was speculative and the formal claim was filed beyond the 15-day period required by Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract, computed from the date of discharge [2, 4]. MPS further argued the action was barred by prescription and their liability should be limited to P500 total [3, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the plaintiff's claim is barred by failure to file within the 15-day period prescribed in the Management Contract.
2. W/N the action is barred by prescription.
3. W/N the arrastre operator’s liability is limited to P500 for the entire missing shipment.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The defense of late filing was not established. The Supreme Court held that the 15-day period to file a claim commences not from the date of discharge, but from the date the consignee *learns* of the loss, damage, or misdelivery, or from the date such information could have been secured with due diligence [4]. A provisional claim filed before knowledge of the loss is premature and speculative [6]. However, since the record failed to show when the plaintiff actually received the remaining goods or was notified of the discharge, it could not be determined if the formal claim was late; thus, the defense failed [7].

2. **NO.** The action was filed on time. Under Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract, a consignee has one year from the date the claim is denied or rejected to file an action [3]. Where the arrastre operator does not act on the claim, the rejection is deemed to have occurred upon the expiration of one year from the date of discharge (January 8, 1962) [3]. Consequently, the plaintiff had one year from that deemed rejection (until January 8, 1963) to sue. The complaint filed on January 19, 1962, was well within the period [3].

3. **NO.** The limitation of liability in the Management Contract is "P500 for *each package*" [5]. The Court affirmed the lower court's holding that a "bundle" constitutes a "package." Since 35 bundles were lost, the award of P1,089.15 is within the liability limit [5].

The decision of the lower court is AFFIRMED [8].
