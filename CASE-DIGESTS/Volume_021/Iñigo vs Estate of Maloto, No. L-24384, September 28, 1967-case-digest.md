I. CAPTION
MARGARITA IÑIGO v. ESTATE OF ADRIANA MALOTO, GREGORIO L. LIRA, Special Administrator, et al., G.R. No. L-24384, September 28, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Margarita Iñigo filed a suit to compel the heirs of Adriana Maloto (defendants) to execute a deed of sale for a house and lot in Iloilo City [1]. Iñigo alleged that on March 29, 1963, she paid Adriana P10,000.00 as the purchase price based on a verbal understanding [1]. No receipt or written deed was executed at the time due to their "almost filial relationship" and the unavailability of Adriana's lawyer [1]. Iñigo, however, took possession and exercised dominion over the property by constructing a retail store and making improvements [1]. After Adriana died in October 1963, the property title was transferred to her nephews and niece [1]. The defendants refused Iñigo's demand for a deed of sale [1]. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo dismissed Iñigo's complaint on the ground that the claim was unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds [1, 2]. Additionally, defendants argued that a prior decision in an ejectment case filed against Iñigo, which declared her a mere lessee, barred the present suit [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the verbal contract of sale is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds.
2. W/N the judgment in the ejectment case bars the suit for ownership/specific performance.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the Statute of Frauds is applicable only to executory contracts, not to contracts that are totally or partially performed [2]. Under Article 1403 (2) (e) of the Civil Code, a verbal contract for the sale of real property is unenforceable if executory; however, Iñigo’s complaint alleged that the purchase price was paid and that she performed acts of ownership by improving the property [2]. These facts constitute a consummated or partially performed contract [2]. Consequently, oral evidence of the alleged consummated sale is not forbidden by the Statute of Frauds and may not be excluded in court [2].

2. **NO.** The Court held that a decision in an ejectment case is not an obstacle to a suit to compel the execution of a deed of sale because an action for ejectment is no bar to another action contesting ownership [5]. Furthermore, since the issue of ownership became apparent during the trial of the ejectment case, the City Court effectively lost jurisdiction to resolve the matter, as it could not decide possession without settling ownership [5].

The order of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo dismissing the complaint is set aside, and the case is remanded for further proceedings [6].
