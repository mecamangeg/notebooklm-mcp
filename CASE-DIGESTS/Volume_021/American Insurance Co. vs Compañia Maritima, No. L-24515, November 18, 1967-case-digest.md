I. CAPTION
THE AMERICAN INSURANCE COMPANY v. COMPANIA MARITIMA, ET AL. and MACONDRAY & CO., INC., G.R. No. L-24515, November 18, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff American Insurance Company insured a cargo of tractor parts shipped from New York with "freight prepaid to Cebu City" aboard the "M/S Toreador," for which defendant-appellee Macondray & Co., Inc. acted as general agent [1, 2]. The vessel arrived in Manila on September 18, 1962, and the cargo was transshipped to Cebu via the inter-island vessel "SS Siquijor," arriving on September 24, 1962 [3]. Upon delivery, a shortage was discovered. The plaintiff paid the consignee the insured value and, as subrogee, filed a complaint for recovery [3].

While the original complaint against the other carriers was filed on September 24, 1963, Macondray was only impleaded in an amended complaint filed on November 6, 1964 [3, 4]. Macondray moved to dismiss on the ground of prescription under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), which sets a one-year period for filing suit [5]. Plaintiff argued that the Civil Code's longer prescriptive period should apply, claiming Macondray acted merely as a "forwarding agent" during the transshipment leg [6]. The lower court dismissed the complaint against Macondray based on prescription [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action against Macondray is barred by prescription under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the action is based on the contract of carriage up to the final port of destination, Cebu City, for which freight was prepaid [2]. The transshipment from Manila to Cebu was not a separate transaction but part of Macondray's obligation as general agent [8]. The fact that an inter-island vessel was used for transshipment did not operate to remove the transaction from the operation of the COGSA [8].

Under Section 3(6) of the COGSA, the carrier is discharged from liability unless suit is brought within one year after delivery of the goods [5]. Since the goods were delivered in September 1962 and Macondray was impleaded only in November 1964, the one-year period had lapsed [4]. Citing *Go Chang & Co., Inc. v. Aboitiz & Co., Inc.*, the Court affirmed the order of dismissal [8, 9].
