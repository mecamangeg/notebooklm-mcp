I. CAPTION
ROMUALDO MONTESINO, JUSTINIANA MONTESINO, ODON MONTESINO, NARCISA MONTESINO and BERNARDO MONTESINO v. EUSEBIO RULLAN and ESPEDITO PISON, G.R. No. L-22057, December 29, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petra Limsiaco applied for a homestead patent in 1939 but died around 1942 or 1943. Original Certificate of Title No. P-807 was issued in the name of the "Heirs of Petra Limsiaco" on July 8, 1954. On September 2, 1954, defendant Eusebio Rullan, claiming to be Petra's surviving spouse, executed a "Declaration of Heirship" which resulted in the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-16421 in his name. Subsequently, TCT No. T-31734 was issued to defendant Espedito Pison.

On April 11, 1962, plaintiffs Montesino filed a complaint to annul the titles and compel conveyance of the property. The lower court dismissed the complaint, ruling that Eugenio de la Cruz (through whom plaintiffs presumably claimed rights as the alleged legal spouse) had lost his rights by prescription.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs' action to enforce their rights to the estate is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the action was filed beyond the statutory period. Under Section 4, Rule 74 of the Rules of Court, an heir or other person unduly deprived of lawful participation in the estate has two years to judicially enforce their rights. Jurisprudence (e.g., *Diaz v. Gorricho*, *Gerona v. Guzman*) has extended this to four years.

The period is counted from the summary "settlement and distribution" of the estate. In this case, distribution took place upon the issuance of TCT No. T-16421 to Rullan on September 2, 1954. Consequently, the period to file suit expired at the latest on September 2, 1958. Since the complaint was not filed until April 11, 1962, the action is barred by prescription.

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
