I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO PINEDA, ET AL. v. PASTOR DE GUZMAN, Judge, Court of Agrarian Relations, and BEATRIZ D. VDA. DE FELICIANO, G.R. Nos. L-23773-74, December 29, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondent Beatriz D. Vda. de Feliciano filed petitions with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) to eject her tenants, petitioners Pineda et al., on the ground that she intended to mechanize her landholdings. The CAR rendered a decision on February 1, 1964, authorizing the ejectment and mechanization, which became final and executory in March 1964 [1]. On September 3, 1964, Feliciano moved for the execution of the decision [1].

The tenants opposed the execution, arguing that under Section 50(a) of Republic Act No. 1199 (Agricultural Tenancy Act), as amended, the dispossession of a tenant not willing to be resettled cannot be enforced until the lapse of one year from the date the decision becomes final [2]. They averred they were unwilling to be resettled [2]. Respondent Judge de Guzman granted the motion for execution on October 7, 1964, ruling that the procedural rule in RA 1199 was abrogated by the Agricultural Land Reform Code (RA 3844) and the Revised Rules of Court, which mandate execution as a matter of right upon finality of judgment [3-5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the execution of the decision dispossessing the tenants was proper despite the non-lapse of the one-year period prescribed by Section 50(a) of RA 1199.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the order of execution.

The Court held that the proviso in Section 50(a) of RA 1199 is substantive in character, not merely procedural [6]. It confers a substantive right upon tenants to be protected from a sudden change in their condition of livelihood [7]. Since the rule-making power of the Supreme Court is limited to pleading, practice, and procedure and cannot diminish substantive rights, the Revised Rules of Court could not have abrogated this provision [8].

Furthermore, Section 168 of the Agricultural Land Reform Code (RA 3844) explicitly provides that pending cases shall be decided in accordance with RA 1199 [9]. Additionally, Section 4 of RA 3844 allows existing share tenancy contracts to continue under RA 1199 until the National Land Reform Council proclaims that government agencies for leasehold are operating in the region; no such proclamation was shown in this case [10]. Thus, the dispossession of a tenant unwilling to be resettled cannot be enforced until one year after the decision becomes final [10].

The Court also noted that the landowner was guilty of laches for waiting until the planting season was advanced to demand execution, which violated principles of equity and social justice [11, 12].

The Order of October 7, 1964, was **SET ASIDE**.
