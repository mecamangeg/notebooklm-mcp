I. CAPTION
AMADO CAYANAN, ET AL. v. LEON DE LOS SANTOS and FELIX L. CAMAYA, G.R. No. L-21150, December 26, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On May 30, 1958, the Court of First Instance of Pampanga confirmed respondent De los Santos' title to Lot No. 56 of the Porac Cadastre, and a decree of registration was issued on August 8, 1958 [1]. On October 26, 1958, De los Santos executed a Deed of Absolute Sale covering the lot in favor of respondent Camaya [1]. On December 16, 1958, petitioners Cayanan, et al. filed a petition for review in the same proceeding, alleging that the registration was obtained through actual fraud and that the subsequent sale to Camaya was simulated to avoid review [1]. The lower court denied the petition, ruling that since the lot had already been transferred, the question of whether the transfer was fictitious and Camaya was not an innocent purchaser must be threshed out in a separate ordinary civil action, not in the simple petition for review [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the cadastral court, in a petition for review of a decree filed within the one-year period, can inquire into an allegation that the subject lot was transferred in a simulated sale to avoid such review.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the cadastral court may inquire into such allegations. The adjudication of land in a registration or cadastral case does not become final and incontrovertible until the expiration of one year from the entry of the final decree [4]. As long as this one-year period has not elapsed, the decision remains under the control and sound discretion of the court rendering it, which may, after hearing, set aside the decision or decree and adjudicate the land to another party [4, 5].

The Court cited *Director of Lands v. Busuego* and *Capio v. Capio* to support the principle that petitions for review filed within one year are properly cognizable by the court that rendered the decision [5-7]. It was error for the lower court to require a separate civil action to test the validity of the transfer when the petition was filed within the statutory period [3].

The Order of February 9, 1959 is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED to the lower court for a hearing on the merits [8].
