I. CAPTION
FIREMAN’S FUND INSURANCE COMPANY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and UNITED STATES LINES CO., G.R. No. L-26618, October 23, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, as insurer, paid the consignee General Electric Philippines the sum of P36,914.35 for the loss of two packages of industrial control parts discharged by the vessel SS "Pioneer Mist" into the custody of the Bureau of Customs as arrastre operator [1]. As subrogee, Fireman's Fund filed a complaint for recovery of sum of money in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against the Republic of the Philippines and United States Lines Co. [1]. The Republic moved to dismiss the complaint, alleging non-suability of the State without its consent and non-compliance with Act No. 3083 (as amended by C.A. 327), which requires money claims to be filed with the Auditor General [2]. The CFI dismissed the case against the Republic, prompting Fireman's Fund to appeal [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Republic of the Philippines may be sued for claims arising from the arrastre service performed by the Bureau of Customs.
2. W/N the money claim should have been filed with the Auditor General.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The assessment and collection of revenues is a prime governmental function carried out by the Republic through the Bureau of Customs [3, 4]. The arrastre service is a necessary incidental function to this governmental duty [3, 4]. Consequently, neither the Republic nor the Bureau of Customs may be sued without their consent for reasons of public policy [3, 4].

2. **YES.** Under Act No. 3083, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 327, money claims against the government must be filed with the Office of the Auditor General [5, 6]. The Court rejected the argument that the claim was unliquidated merely because the Government disputed its liability; the claim was for a fixed sum based on accessible papers and records, making it a liquidated claim subject to the Auditor General's jurisdiction [5-7].

The order of dismissal is AFFIRMED [7].
