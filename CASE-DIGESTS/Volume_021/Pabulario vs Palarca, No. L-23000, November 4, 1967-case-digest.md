I. CAPTION
MATEO J. PABULARIO v. THE HONORABLE POMPEYO L. PALARCA, G.R. No. L-23000, November 4, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Mateo J. Pabulario was charged in the Municipal Court of Iligan City (presided by respondent Judge Palarca) with reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property and multiple slight physical injuries. The information alleged that on July 26, 1961, Pabulario negligently drove a truck and hit a passenger jeep, causing damages of P397.00 and slight physical injuries to passengers [1, 2]. Pabulario filed a Motion to Quash, arguing the information charged more than one offense: (1) damage to property through reckless imprudence and (2) multiple slight physical injuries through reckless imprudence [3]. Judge Palarca denied the motion. Pabulario filed a petition for certiorari in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Lanao del Norte, which granted the writ and ruled that the Municipal Court lacked jurisdiction or that the information was defective for complexing a misdemeanor with other offenses [4, 5]. Judge Palarca appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the information charged more than one offense (duplicity of offenses), thereby rendering the proceedings void or divesting the Municipal Court of jurisdiction.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CFI's decision. The Court held that the information did not charge two separate offenses but a single quasi-offense of reckless imprudence. Under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code, criminal negligence is a distinct quasi-offense and not merely a modality or way of committing a crime [6, 7]. What is principally penalized is the mental attitude—the dangerous recklessness or lack of care—rather than the resulting acts themselves [7]. Thus, the charge is technically the single offense of "reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property and physical injuries" [8].

Furthermore, even assuming *arguendo* that the information alleged two distinct offenses, the Municipal Court still had jurisdiction because both the offense of damage to property amounting to P397.00 through reckless negligence and that of multiple slight physical injuries through reckless negligence fall within the jurisdiction of said court [9, 10]. Splitting the action would only cause unnecessary inconvenience to the administration of justice [11].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the petition for certiorari in the CFI is **DISMISSED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred with the ruling [12].
