I. CAPTION
FRANCISCA LAZO v. J. M. TUASON & Co., INC. and SHERIFF OF QUEZON CITY, G.R. No. L-23817, December 11, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Francisca Lazo purchased a portion of the Tatalon Estate from a successor of the Deudors in 1949. In 1953, a compromise agreement was entered into between the Deudors and J.M. Tuason & Co., whereby the latter recognized the Deudors' contracts of sale and allowed buyers to purchase the land under certain conditions.

In 1957, J.M. Tuason & Co. filed an action for recovery of ownership (Civil Case No. Q-4193) against Lazo. The Court of First Instance (CFI) rendered judgment ordering Lazo to vacate the premises, which became final and executory. An order of execution was issued in 1961, followed by a writ of demolition in 1962. Lazo subsequently filed a new suit (Civil Case No. Q-6315) to annul the judgment in the ejectment case on the ground of fraud, alleging she was assured by the respondent that the ejectment case was a mere formality and would not be executed against her. She also sought to enforce her preferential right to buy the land under the 1953 compromise agreement. The CFI dismissed the complaint.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Lazo’s action to annul the judgment based on fraud is barred by laches.
2. W/N Lazo’s claim for specific performance to enforce her preferential right to buy is barred by res judicata.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that Lazo unduly delayed in alleging fraud. Despite the order of execution being issued on January 12, 1961—which clearly indicated the respondent's intent to eject her contrary to the alleged assurances—she did not raise the issue of fraud at that time. Instead, she merely sought the suspension of the writ of demolition and asked for an extension to vacate, implying acquiescence to the judgment. She only filed the action to annul on March 27, 1962. Laches or unreasonable delay in enforcing a right is persuasive of a want of merit and may be destructive of the right itself, citing *Buenaventura v. David*.

2. **YES.** The enforcement of the alleged preferential right to buy the land under the compromise agreement is barred by *res judicata*. The Court ruled that such a claim is in the nature of a compulsory counterclaim which should have been interposed in the earlier ejectment suit (Civil Case No. Q-4193). Failing to raise it in the previous case bars its enforcement in a subsequent action, consistent with the doctrine in *De Jesus v. J. M. Tuason & Co.* and *J. M. Tuason & Co. v. Sanvictores*.

The order of dismissal is affirmed.
