I. CAPTION
**TALLER BISAYAS EMPLOYEES AND WORKERS ASSOCIATION (TALBEWA) v. PANAY ALLIED WORKERS UNION, STRACHAN & MCMURRAY LTD. (TALLER BISAYAS), and THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS**, G.R. No. L-23927, September 19, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On December 17, 1963, respondent Panay Allied Workers Union (PAWU) filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) for certification as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees of Strachan & McMurray, Ltd. (Taller Bisayas) [1]. During a hearing on January 28, 1964, where PAWU and the company stipulated on election details, petitioner TALBEWA verbally moved to intervene [2]. The hearing examiner denied the motion because TALBEWA was not yet a registered labor organization at that time [2].

On February 24, 1964, the CIR affirmed the denial and ordered the Department of Labor to conduct a certification election [3]. TALBEWA, having obtained its certificate of registration on February 3, 1964, filed a formal motion to intervene on March 2, 1964 [3]. On March 30, 1964, the election was conducted, resulting in PAWU obtaining an absolute majority [4, 5]. Subsequently, on April 17, 1964, the CIR denied TALBEWA’s formal motion for being filed too late, and the CIR *en banc* denied the motion for reconsideration [4]. TALBEWA appealed by certiorari.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations abused its discretion in denying TALBEWA's motion to intervene.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's orders, ruling that there was no abuse of discretion [5, 6]. First, the denial of the initial verbal motion was proper because TALBEWA was not yet a duly registered labor organization at the time it was made [5]. Second, the formal motion was filed more than a month later, by which time the CIR had already affirmed the denial and ordered the election [7].

Furthermore, there was no clear showing that TALBEWA’s intervention would have altered the result of the election, where PAWU won by an absolute majority [5, 7]. The Court held that a mere allegation that the petitioner had the majority support of the workers is not enough to set aside the election [7]. Citing *National City Bank of New York v. NCBNY Employees Union*, the Court emphasized that in the absence of an express allegation that a new hearing would change the facts found, granting a new trial would be an "idle ceremony" that does not serve the ends of justice [8].

The orders appealed from are **AFFIRMED** [6].
