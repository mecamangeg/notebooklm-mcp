I. CAPTION
PANGASINAN TRANSPORTATION CO., INC. (PANTRANCO) v. HON. NICASIO A. YATCO and ELPIDIO O. DIZON, G.R. No. L-23090, October 31, 1967, 21 SCRA 658, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On November 6, 1962, respondent Elpidio O. Dizon, a passenger on a bus owned by petitioner Pangasinan Transportation Co., Inc. (Pantranco), was injured when the bus collided with a truck in Apalit, Pampanga [1]. Dizon filed a complaint for damages in the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Civil Case No. 7237), alleging he was a resident of Quezon City [1, 2]. Pantranco filed an answer with a counterclaim and a third-party complaint against the truck owner, La Mallorca-Pambusco [1]. During the hearing, Dizon testified that he actually resided in Dagupan City and was only vacationing in Quezon City [2]. Pantranco moved to dismiss the case for improper venue, but respondent Judge Yatco denied the motion [2]. After presenting part of its evidence, Pantranco filed this petition for prohibition to restrain the lower court from proceeding [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Pantranco waived its right to object to improper venue.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that Pantranco waived its right to object to venue. Although objection to venue is usually deemed waived if not raised before the filing of the answer, in this case, the waiver was established by Pantranco's specific actions. The Court ruled that the filing of a counterclaim and a third-party complaint "necessarily implied a submission to the jurisdiction of said court" [3]. Furthermore, Pantranco’s introduction of evidence after the denial of its motion to dismiss tended to have the same effect of waiving the objection [3].

Petition dismissed [4].
