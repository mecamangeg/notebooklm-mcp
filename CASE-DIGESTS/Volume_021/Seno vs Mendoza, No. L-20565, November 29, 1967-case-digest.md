I. CAPTION
JANUARIO T. SENO, ET AL. v. THE HONORABLE JUDGE JOSE M. MENDOZA OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF CEBU and CARLOS A. GO THONG & CO., G.R. No. L-20565, November 29, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, members of the United Seamen's Union of the Philippines (USUP), were dismissed by respondent Carlos A. Go Thong & Co. upon the Union's demand, pursuant to a "closed-shop" clause in their Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) requiring membership in good standing [1]. Petitioners requested reinstatement and subsequently picketed the company's vessels, filing a charge of Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [1, 2].

Respondent company filed a civil case for damages and injunction against petitioners in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu [2]. The CFI Judge issued a writ of preliminary injunction to stop the picket [3, 4]. Petitioners challenged the CFI's jurisdiction, arguing the case involved a labor dispute cognizable by the CIR and that the CBA was void because it was renewed while petitions for certification election by other unions were pending [5-7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal of petitioners pursuant to the closed-shop agreement constitutes an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) within the exclusive jurisdiction of the CIR.
2. W/N the Court of First Instance (CFI) has jurisdiction over the civil case for damages and enforcement of the CBA.
3. W/N the preliminary injunction issued by the CFI was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The dismissal was in compliance with a valid existing collective bargaining agreement and does not constitute an unfair labor practice. The Supreme Court held that the pendency of a petition for certification election does not bar the renewal of an existing CBA; otherwise, there would be a "gap" or interregnum where no agreement governs, leading to confusion [8]. Since the dismissal was sanctioned by the closed-shop provision authorized under Section 4(a)(4) of Republic Act 875, it is not a ULP exclusively cognizable by the CIR [9, 10].

2. **YES.** Jurisdiction pertains to the ordinary courts. The issue involves the enforcement of a CBA provision and the recovery of damages, which does not fall under the specific cases belonging to the CIR (such as those involving industries indispensable to national interest, minimum wage, 8-hour labor law, or ULP) [11]. The action was primarily to shift liabilities to the Union under the CBA terms [10].

3. **NO.** While the CFI had jurisdiction over the main case, the issuance of the injunction was void because the procedure under the Rules of Court was used instead of the strict requirements of the Magna Carta of Labor (R.A. 875). The Court held that since the case was an outgrowth of a "labor dispute" (involving tenure of employment), the trial court was required to follow Section 9(d) of R.A. 875, which mandates a hearing of witnesses in open court and specific findings of fact, rather than merely issuing an injunction under the Rules of Court [12, 13].

**Order set aside and case remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.**
