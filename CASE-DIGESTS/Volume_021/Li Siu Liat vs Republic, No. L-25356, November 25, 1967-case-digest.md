I. CAPTION
**LI SIU LIAT alias PERFECTO alias NG SE LIAT v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-25356, November 25, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Li Siu Liat was granted Philippine citizenship in 1956. In 1962, the Republic filed a petition to cancel his naturalization on grounds of fraud, alleging he concealed his common-law wife, Mary Go, and their illegitimate children. On July 26, 1965, Judge Jesus Y. Perez of the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, Branch III, issued an order cancelling the petitioner's naturalization certificate. Shortly after, Judge Perez was appointed to the Court of Appeals.

To fill the vacancy, Judge Emigdio V. Nietes was temporarily detailed to Branch III. Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) of the cancellation order. On October 12, 1965, Judge Placido C. Ramos took his oath as the newly appointed regular judge of Branch III. However, three days later, on October 15, 1965, Judge Nietes issued an order granting the petitioner's MR and reversing Judge Perez’s cancellation order. The Republic appealed, questioning the validity of Judge Nietes' order.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Judge Nietes had jurisdiction to issue the order granting the Motion for Reconsideration after the regular judge had assumed office.
2. W/N the petitioner’s naturalization certificate was properly cancelled for fraud.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that Judge Nietes’ order was null and void. Under **Section 51 of the Judiciary Act of 1948**, the temporary assignment of a judge to a vacant branch is valid only while the vacancy exists. Judge Nietes' authority to act as judge of Branch III terminated *ipso facto* on October 12, 1965, when the regular judge, Judge Ramos, took his oath and assumed duties. Consequently, on October 15, 1965, Judge Nietes was neither a *de jure* nor a *de facto* judge of that branch, and his acts were void.

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the cancellation of the naturalization certificate. Evidence showed that the petitioner committed fraud and deceit by concealing his relationship with his common-law wife and their illegitimate children, falsely claiming one of them as his legitimate child with his legal wife. This violated the requirement to conduct oneself in a "proper and irreproachable manner." Furthermore, he failed to state all his former places of residence in his application, a violation of **Section 7 of the Naturalization Law**, which is a fatal defect.

The order of Judge Nietes is reversed and set aside; the order of Judge Perez cancelling the naturalization certificate is affirmed.
