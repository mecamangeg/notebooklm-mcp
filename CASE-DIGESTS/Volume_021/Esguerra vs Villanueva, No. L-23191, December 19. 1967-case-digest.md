I. CAPTION
GERONIMO G. ESGUERRA and CRISTINA G. ESGUERRA v. THE HON. FELIPE M. VILLANUEVA, MUNICIPAL JUDGE OF DAGUPAN CITY, THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF PANGASINAN, ISIDRO DE GUZMAN and SEGUNDA DE GUZMAN, G.R. No. L-23191, December 19, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Geronimo and Cristina Esguerra (Esguerras) filed civil cases against respondents Isidro and Segunda de Guzman (De Guzmans) for unpaid rentals and a sum of money. The parties entered into a compromise agreement wherein the De Guzmans admitted liability of P2,260.00, promising to pay by November 26, 1962. This agreement was approved by respondent Municipal Judge Villanueva. The De Guzmans failed to pay by the stipulated date. Consequently, Judge Villanueva issued writs of execution on December 14, 1962.

However, the De Guzmans later delivered P800.00 on December 13, 1962, and P1,460.00 on January 5, 1963, to the Esguerras, who received said amounts. Claiming that the Esguerras' receipt of these sums constituted "acceptance" of the irregular performance without protest, the De Guzmans moved for the release of their attached properties. Judge Villanueva granted the motion, ruling the obligation fully extinguished under Article 1235 of the Civil Code. The Court of First Instance dismissed the Esguerras' petition for certiorari, upholding the lower court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the receipt of partial and late payments by the creditors constitutes "acceptance" of incomplete performance under Article 1235 of the Civil Code, thereby extinguishing the obligation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the mere "receipt" of a partial payment is not necessarily an "acceptance" thereof within the purview of the law. Under Article 1235 of the Civil Code, the verb "accept" means to take as "satisfactory or sufficient," or to "give assent to," or to "agree" or "accede" to an incomplete or irregular performance.

In this case, the Esguerras did not assent to the irregular payment. This was evidenced by their acts: (1) they requested writs of execution the very day following the first partial payment; and (2) they insisted on the disposal of the attached properties despite the payments. The Court ruled that the law does not require a creditor's protest to be made in a particular manner or time. So long as the acts of the creditor, at the time of the irregular payment or within a reasonable time thereafter, evince dissatisfaction, the obligation is not deemed fully extinguished.

The petition was granted, the decision appealed from was reversed, and the Municipal Judge was directed to issue alias writs of execution.
