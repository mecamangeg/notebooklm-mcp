I. CAPTION
DOMINGO MANAY v. A. L. BUENAVENTURA, Acting Commissioner of Civil Service, G.R. No. L-24097, November 18, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Anastacio Revilla had served as Chief of Police (COP) of Santa Cruz, Marinduque, since 1953. On January 16, 1960, the Municipal Mayor appointed petitioner Domingo Manay as COP and demoted Revilla to Police Sergeant. Both took their oaths that day. On October 30, 1960, respondent Commissioner of Civil Service (CSC) approved Revilla’s appointment as COP provisionally, recognizing his right to retention under Republic Act No. 2260 (Civil Service Act) for having served continuously for over five years, and returned his appointment as Sergeant without action. Revilla also passed the patrolman examination in February 1960.

Conversely, the CSC approved Manay’s appointment only for "actual services rendered" rather than as permanent. Manay sought reconsideration, which was denied. He then filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, alleging the CSC abused its discretion by disregarding Revilla's alleged physical unfitness and claiming Revilla was barred by laches and estoppel. The CFI denied the petition. Manay appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court on pure questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Commissioner of Civil Service committed grave abuse of discretion in approving Revilla's appointment despite allegations of physical unfitness.
2. W/N Revilla is barred by laches or estoppel from claiming the position.
3. W/N Manay is entitled to a permanent appointment via mandamus.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court found no factual basis for the charge of grave abuse of discretion. The records did not show why Revilla's appointment was approved as provisional, nor was there proof the CSC disregarded his physical condition. Furthermore, the claim of physical unfitness was contradictory, as the Mayor had appointed Revilla as Police Sergeant, a position requiring more physical exertion than Chief of Police.

2. **NO.** Laches does not apply because the CSC had already acted favorably on Revilla's appointment and disapproved his demotion as early as October 30, 1960; thus, Revilla's formal protest in 1961 was actually unnecessary. Estoppel is also inapplicable; although Revilla was appointed Sergeant, he continued to discharge the duties of COP because Manay went on leave immediately after his appointment.

3. **NO.** Under Paragraph 4, Section 23 of R.A. No. 2260, non-eligible employees with five years or more of continuous satisfactory service are accorded preferred consideration for qualifying examinations and retention. Revilla met these requirements. Consequently, Manay possessed an inferior right to the position. Since Manay had no legal right to permanence, mandamus cannot lie to compel the Commissioner to approve his appointment as permanent.

The appealed decision is AFFIRMED.
