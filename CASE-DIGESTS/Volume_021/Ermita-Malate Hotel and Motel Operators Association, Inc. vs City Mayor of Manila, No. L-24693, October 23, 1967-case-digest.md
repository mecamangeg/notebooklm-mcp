I. CAPTION
ERMITA-MALATE HOTEL AND MOTEL OPERATORS ASSOCIATION, INC., HOTEL DEL MAR, INC. and GO HIU v. THE HONORABLE CITY MAYOR OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-24693, October 23, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, an association of hotel and motel operators, filed a Motion for Reconsideration and a supplemental Motion for New Trial regarding the Supreme Court's decision dated July 31, 1967. This prior decision reversed the lower court's judgment which had declared the challenged Manila ordinance void [1], [2]. The ordinance was enacted to safeguard public morals by minimizing practices such as prostitution and adultery in motels; it required, among other things, that guests fill out registration forms in a lobby open to public view and increased license fees [3], [4]. Petitioners argued that the ordinance violated their constitutional rights to due process, liberty, property, and the protection against unreasonable search and seizure [5]. In their motions, they further alleged a denial of equal protection and asserted that the ordinance contravened the principle of *laissez-faire* [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the ordinance is unconstitutional for violating due process, equal protection, and the principle of *laissez-faire*.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Motions for Reconsideration and New Trial are denied [7], [8].

The Court held that the ordinance is valid based on the presumption of constitutionality. Following the doctrine in *O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co.*, the presumption of validity must prevail in the absence of a factual foundation of record to overthrow the statute [9], [10]. Petitioners failed to present evidence to rebut this presumption [10].

Regarding due process and property rights, the Court ruled that the liberty to contract has never stood in the way of police power measures when called for by circumstances, citing *Nebbia*, *West Coast Hotel Co.*, and *Olsen* [11], [5]. The ordinance is a valid exercise of police power aimed at safeguarding public morals, to which individual rights must yield [12].

On the issue of equal protection, the assertion that the ordinance is invalid because it applies only to Manila motels and not those in the suburbs is "extremely far-fetched," as it applies to all motels within the city limits [13].

Finally, the Court rejected the invocation of *laissez-faire*, stating that the concept has withered and given way to the government's right to intervene in contractual relations affected with public interest to promote the general welfare, citing *Calalang v. Williams* [14], [15].
