I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE ASSOCIATION OF FREE LABOR UNIONS (PAFFLU) v. HONORABLE EMILIANO C. TABIGNE, ET AL., Adm. Case No. 102, November 18, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In an administrative case involving the respondent, Judge Emiliano C. Tabigne, the respondent filed an urgent motion praying for an additional period of five (5) days from October 21, 1967, within which to file his memorandum [1]. Prior to this motion, the Supreme Court had already referred the administrative case to Justice Mojica of the Court of Appeals for investigation [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court should resolve the motion for extension of time to file a memorandum pending the investigation of the case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court resolved to refer the motion to Justice Mojica for action [1]. The Court ruled that because the administrative case had been referred to Mr. Justice Mojica for investigation, he is the proper authority to act on the motion. Consequently, the Court directed that henceforth, until the Investigator has submitted his report, all similar applications and/or motions shall be forwarded to him for the same purpose [2].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Makalintal, Bengzon, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred with the resolution [2].
