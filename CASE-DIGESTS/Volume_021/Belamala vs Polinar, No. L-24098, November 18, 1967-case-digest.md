I. CAPTION
BUENAVENTURA BELAMALA v. MARCELINO POLINAR, G.R. No. L-24098, November 18, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Buenaventura Belamala was the offended party in a criminal case for Frustrated Murder against Mauricio Polinar. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bohol convicted Mauricio of serious physical injuries and ordered him to pay damages (indemnity and moral damages). Mauricio appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA) but died on July 27, 1956, while the appeal was pending. No notice of death was filed, and the CA affirmed the conviction *in toto* in 1958.

Subsequently, Belamala filed a money claim against the Estate of Mauricio Polinar (respondent Administrator Marcelino Polinar) for the amount awarded in the criminal case. The Administrator opposed, arguing that the death of the accused prior to final judgment extinguished his criminal and civil liabilities. The CFI overruled the opposition and admitted the claim. The Administrator appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the civil liability of an accused for physical injuries is extinguished by his death prior to final judgment.
2. W/N the claim for damages may be enforced by filing a claim against the estate under Rule 86 of the Rules of Court.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The civil liability is not extinguished. Under Article 33 of the Civil Code, a civil action for damages on account of physical injuries is entirely separate and distinct from the criminal action. This independent civil action survives the death of the accused and does not contradict Article 108 of the Revised Penal Code, as the heirs acquire the decedent's obligations to the extent of the value of the inheritance. Thus, the obligation to indemnify becomes an obligation of the offender's estate [1], [2].

2. **NO.** While the liability survives, the procedure taken was incorrect. The claim for damages based on a tort or delict (injury to person) cannot be enforced by filing a claim against the estate under Rule 86, which is limited to claims for funeral expenses, last sickness, judgments for money, and claims arising from *contract*. Instead, pursuant to Sections 1 and 2 of Rule 87, the claim should have been prosecuted by a **separate action** against the administrator [3].

The decision allows the survival of the liability but rejects the procedural method used.

**WHEREFORE**, the decision under appeal is **REVERSED** and **SET ASIDE**, but without prejudice to the action of appellee Belamala against the Administrator of the Estate of Mauricio Polinar [4].
