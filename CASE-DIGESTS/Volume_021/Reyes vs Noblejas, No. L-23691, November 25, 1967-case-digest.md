I. CAPTION
ARSENIO REYES v. ANTONIO NOBLEJAS and JOSE SANTOS, G.R. No. L-23691, November 25, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Gamboa and Cariaga were the registered owners of land in Rizal mortgaged to the Philippine National Bank (PNB). Upon their failure to pay, PNB extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage under Act No. 3135. On February 6, 1963, the properties were sold at public auction to petitioner Arsenio Reyes. The sheriff issued the certificate of sale on February 21, 1963, but this certificate was neither registered with the Register of Deeds nor entered in the Primary Entry Book.

On February 10, 1964, Reyes presented an Affidavit of Consolidation of Ownership and a Deed of Sale for registration, claiming the one-year redemption period had expired. The Register of Deeds (RD) of Rizal denied the registration, ruling that the redemption period had not yet expired because the certificate of sale had not been registered. The RD cited *Salazar v. Meneses*, arguing the period runs from registration, not the auction date. The Land Registration Commissioner affirmed the RD's refusal. Reyes appealed, contending that Section 6 of Act No. 3135 expressly states the redemption period is "one year from and after the date of sale" and that registration is unnecessary between immediate parties.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the one-year redemption period in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale of registered land is reckoned from the date of the public auction sale.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the resolution of the Land Registration Commissioner.

The Court held that the redemption period runs from the date of the **registration** of the certificate of sale in the Office of the Register of Deeds, not from the date of the public auction. While Section 6 of Act No. 3135 mentions "date of sale," this must be construed in relation to Section 27, Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court and Section 50 of the Land Registration Law (Act 496).

Section 27, Rule 39 makes the registration of the sheriff's certificate of sale a mandatory requirement. Under Section 50 of Act 496, the act of registration is the operative act to convey or bind registered land. Consequently, the sale only takes effect as a conveyance upon registration. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Salazar v. Meneses* and *Agbulos v. Alberto*, stating that for registered land, the period to redeem begins only when the certificate of sale is registered. This requirement serves to protect third parties and provides constructive notice to potential redemptioners (e.g., successors in interest or creditors). Since Reyes failed to register the certificate of sale, the redemption period had not yet commenced, and the denial of the consolidation of ownership was proper.

The resolution appealed from is affirmed.
