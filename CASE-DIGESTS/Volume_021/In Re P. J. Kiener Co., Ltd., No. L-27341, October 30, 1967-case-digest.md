I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE CONFIRMATION OF ARBITRATOR’S AWARD UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 876; P. J. KIENER COMPANY, LTD., GAVINO UNCHUAN and INTERNATIONAL CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-27341, October 30, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners P.J. Kiener Co., Ltd., Gavino Unchuan, and International Construction Corporation claimed P3,601,971.84 from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) for extra work done on the Mactan Airfield. The Secretary of National Defense contested the amount, and the parties submitted to arbitration under Republic Act No. 876. The arbitrator awarded P2,372,331.40 to the petitioners.

Petitioners filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu to confirm the award. The Republic failed to file an answer. The CFI heard the case *ex parte* and rendered a decision confirming the award on July 3, 1961. Five months later, the Republic moved to intervene and set aside the decision, arguing that the project was funded by the U.S. and required JUSMAG concurrence. The CFI denied the motion. The Republic appealed to the Supreme Court but failed to file its printed record on appeal by the deadline of May 19, 1967. The record was filed nearly four months late on September 8, 1967. The Solicitor General explained the delay was due to a receiving clerk "inadvertently misplacing" the notice.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed for failure to file the printed record on appeal within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal due to the appellant's inexcusable failure to file the printed record on appeal on time. The Court held that appellate courts look with disfavor on excuses such as the misplacing of notices by clerks, characterizing it as a "habitual subterfuge employed by litigants who fail to observe the procedural requirements prescribed in the Rules of Court" [1]. The Court cited *Philippine Air Lines, Inc. v. Arca* and *Ocampo v. Caluag* in support of this strict adherence to procedural timelines. Furthermore, the Court noted that the appellees' previous motion to dismiss did not suspend the running of the period to file the record, as the period had already lapsed when that motion was filed.

Appeal dismissed.
