I. CAPTION
JULIAN G. GINETE v. HON. UBALDO Y. ARCANGEL and LUIS G. DE CASTRO, G.R. No. L-28358, December 8, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ginete and respondent De Castro were opposing candidates for Mayor of Bulan, Sorsogon in the November 14, 1967 elections. During the canvass, it was discovered that the copy of the election return for Precinct No. 41 from the Municipal Treasurer had been tampered with, showing 116 votes for Ginete and 64 for De Castro. In contrast, the certified photostatic copy from the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) showed 106 votes for Ginete and 84 for De Castro. De Castro filed a petition for recount in the Court of First Instance of Sorsogon but failed to implead Ginete as a party respondent. Despite this, Ginete appeared at the hearing through counsel, moved to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction, and cross-examined De Castro’s witnesses. The respondent Judge denied the motion to dismiss and ordered a recount. Ginete filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction due to his non-inclusion in the original petition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the recount petition despite the initial failure to implead the indispensable party (Ginete).
2. W/N the order for recount was valid under the Revised Election Code.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While the petition for recount originally suffered from a defect that would have deprived the court of jurisdiction due to the failure to include Ginete, this procedural or jurisdictional defect was **cured by his voluntary appearance** before the court [1, 2]. The Court noted that Ginete appeared through counsel, sought the dismissal of the petition, and actively participated by cross-examining witnesses [1, 2]. The Court emphasized that election laws must be liberally construed, and technical barriers should not prevent the determination of the true will of the electorate [3, 4].

2. **YES.** The order for recount was proper and in consonance with **Sections 163 and 168 of the Revised Election Code** [2, 5]. The respondent Judge was justified in ordering the recount after verifying the material discrepancy between the tampered election return submitted by the municipal treasurer and the duly certified copy in the possession of the COMELEC [2, 5].

**Petition dismissed.**
