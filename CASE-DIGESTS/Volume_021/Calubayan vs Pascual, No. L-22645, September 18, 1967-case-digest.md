I. CAPTION
CARLOS CALUBAYAN and EMILIA FERRER v. CIRILO PASCUAL, G.R. No. L-22645, September 18, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Calubayan and Ferrer are the registered owners of two parcels of land in Caloocan City, purchased from Philippine Realty Corporation on October 22, 1957 [1, 2]. The defendant, Pascual, was a squatter occupying the land prior to the sale [2, 3]. Upon acquisition, plaintiffs notified the defendant several times to meet with them to arrange for his continued occupation, but the defendant ignored these requests [2]. Plaintiffs tolerated his possession for approximately six years without filing suit [3]. Finally, on February 2, 1963, plaintiffs formally demanded that the defendant vacate the premises [3]. On May 6, 1963, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, framing the suit as one for recovery of possession (*accion publiciana*) [1, 3]. The CFI dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that the proper remedy was ejectment [4]. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing that their aim was recovery of possession, which falls under CFI jurisdiction [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal, holding that the proper remedy is a summary action for ejectment, which falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the inferior (municipal) courts [5].

The Court explained that a person who occupies land by tolerance is bound by an implied promise to vacate upon demand [3]. The one-year period for filing an unlawful detainer case is reckoned from the date of the demand to vacate, not from the initial entry or previous notifications [3]. The Court found that the plaintiffs' earlier notices were merely invitations to negotiate a landlord-tenant relationship, not definitive demands to vacate [6]. Even if considered demands, the established rule is that the one-year period is counted from the date of the *last* demand, which in this case was February 2, 1963 [7].

Since the complaint was filed on May 6, 1963—less than one year after the effective demand—the action is one for unlawful detainer, not *accion publiciana* [5]. The Court cited *Yu v. De Lara* regarding possession by tolerance and *Cruz v. Atencio* regarding the "last demand" rule [3, 7]. Consequently, the CFI correctly dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction [8].
