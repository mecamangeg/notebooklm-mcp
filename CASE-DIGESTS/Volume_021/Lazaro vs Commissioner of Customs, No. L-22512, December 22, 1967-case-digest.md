I. CAPTION
ANDRES E. LAZARO v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. Nos. L-22512 and L-22514, December 22, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lazaro made importations without the corresponding Central Bank release certificate [1]. The Collector of Customs decreed the forfeiture of the goods for violation of Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 in relation to Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code [1, 2]. Since the goods had already been released to Lazaro, he was ordered to pay their cash value. The Commissioner of Customs affirmed the decision, ordering the confiscation of Lazaro's bond and payment of the value plus estimated profits [2]. The Court of Tax Appeals affirmed the Commissioner's decision [3]. Lazaro appealed, arguing that Central Bank Circular No. 133 and Republic Act No. 1410 repealed the earlier circulars, thereby abating his liability, and that the goods should be appraised based on their value in the country of origin, not the local market value [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the forfeiture was proper despite the issuance of CB Circular No. 133 and R.A. No. 1410.
2. W/N the appraised value for seizure proceedings should be based on the local market value.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that Central Bank Circular No. 133 did not repeal Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 regarding the necessity of a release certificate; rather, it required such certificates and incorporated existing regulations by reference [1, 6]. Furthermore, R.A. No. 1410 did not abate liability for violations of Circular No. 45 because Section 3 of the Act expressly provided that goods previously imported on a no-dollar remittance basis shall not be affected by the Act's operation [7, 8].

2. **YES.** For seizure proceedings, the correct basis for appraisal is the "value in the local market" pursuant to Section 1377 of the Revised Administrative Code [9]. The Court rejected Lazaro's reliance on Section 13(a) of the Philippine Tariff Act of 1909, ruling that said provision applies only to appraisal for determining customs duties [9, 10]. Additionally, the Court noted that the inclusion of 30% estimated profits in the bond was a contractual obligation Lazaro acquiesced to when the goods were released [11].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [12].
