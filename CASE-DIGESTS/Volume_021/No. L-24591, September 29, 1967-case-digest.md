I. CAPTION
CALTEX (PHILIPPINES), INC. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-24591, September 29, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Caltex (Philippines), Inc. was the consignee of 222 ingots of pig tin shipped from Penang, Malaya, which arrived in Manila on January 9, 1961 [1]. The shipment was discharged into the custody of defendants Manila Port Service and Manila Railroad Company, the arrastre operators, on the same day. However, defendants only delivered 216 ingots [1]. Caltex filed a provisional claim on January 25, 1961, followed by a formal claim, but defendants rejected it [1].

Caltex sued for the value of the missing ingots (P2,311.66) in the Municipal Court of Manila, which dismissed the case [1]. On appeal, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila ruled in favor of Caltex [1]. Defendants appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law, arguing that the provisional claim was defective because it did not state the value of the goods and was filed beyond the 15-day period prescribed in the Management Contract [1, 2]. Defendants claimed the period expired because the shipment was discharged on January 9, and the claim was filed 16 days later on January 25 [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the provisional claim was defective for failing to state the value of the missing goods.
2. W/N the claim was filed within the prescriptive period required by the Management Contract.
3. W/N the award of attorney's fees was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The provisional claim was not defective. The law does not require the value of the goods to be stated in the provisional claim, provided the claimant signifies the intent to demand payment [4]. The purpose of the provisional claim is merely to afford the arrastre operator a reasonable opportunity to check the validity of the claim while facts are fresh in the minds of the persons involved (*Consunji v. Manila Port Service*) [4].

2. **YES.** The claim was deemed timely because the defense of prescription failed. The Supreme Court held that the 15-day period to file a claim is computed not from the date of discharge of the goods from the carrying vessel, but from the date the consignee learns of the loss, damage, or misdelivery, or from the date such information could have been secured with reasonable diligence (*Yu Kimteng Construction Corp. v. Manila Port Service*) [5]. Since there was no evidence presented regarding the date Caltex learned of the loss, the appellants' defense that the claim was time-barred could not be sustained [5].

3. **YES.** The Court upheld the award of attorney's fees, noting that arrastre operators frequently refuse to honor similar claims based on mere technicalities. The Court emphasized that such technicalities should not affect the substantive rights of the parties [6].

**Decision affirmed** [6].
