I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO SALUNGA v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC., et al., G.R. No. L-22456, September 27, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Francisco Salunga, a San Miguel Brewery employee since 1948 and a union member since 1953, criticized union officers for irregular fund disbursements. In response, he was removed as a union steward. On August 18, 1961, Salunga tendered his resignation from the Union. The Union accepted it and, citing the closed-shop provision of their Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), demanded his dismissal. The Company informed Salunga that resignation would result in his termination. Salunga attempted to withdraw his resignation on August 31, 1961, but the Union refused to readmit him and insisted on his dismissal. The Company, initially reluctant and attempting to mediate, eventually dismissed Salunga effective September 30, 1961.

The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) Trial Judge found both the Union and the Company guilty of Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) and ordered reinstatement with backwages. However, the CIR *en banc* reversed this decision and dismissed the case. Salunga appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Union committed Unfair Labor Practice by refusing to readmit Salunga and insisting on his dismissal.
2. W/N the Company committed Unfair Labor Practice by dismissing Salunga.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Union acted arbitrarily and committed ULP. While a state generally cannot compel voluntary associations to admit members, this rule is qualified for labor unions holding a monopoly on labor through closed-shop agreements, as their admission requirements become affected with public interest. Unions cannot arbitrarily exclude qualified applicants [1, 2]. The Court held that if unions can be compelled to admit new members, they can certainly be compelled to readmit a long-standing member who resigned due to provocations by union officers [3]. Salunga's criticism of union officers was an exercise of his right to free speech and did not justify the Union’s arbitrary refusal to accept the withdrawal of his resignation [4].

2. **NO.** The Company did not commit ULP. The Company acted in good faith; it was reluctant to dismiss Salunga, warned him of the consequences, and even tried to maintain the status quo while Salunga appealed to the Union's higher federation [5]. The Company could not safely inquire into the internal motives of the Union officers and was justified in presuming the Union acted regularly [5].

Consequently, Salunga is entitled to reinstatement to his former position. However, since the Company was not guilty of ULP, the backwages shall be borne **exclusively** by the Union [6].

The resolution of the CIR *en banc* is reversed, and the decision of the Trial Judge is affirmed with modification absolving the Company of ULP liability.
