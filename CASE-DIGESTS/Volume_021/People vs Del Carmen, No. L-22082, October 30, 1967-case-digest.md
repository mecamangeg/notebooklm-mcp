**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ISABEL DEL CARMEN Y PABALAN and CONSOLACION INSURANCE & SURETY CO., G.R. No. L-22082, October 30, 1967, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Consolacion Insurance & Surety Co. (bondsman) posted a P1,000.00 bail bond for accused Isabel del Carmen, who appealed a theft conviction to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. When the accused failed to appear for trial on September 6, 1963, the CFI ordered the bond confiscated and gave the bondsman 30 days to produce the accused and explain why judgment should not be rendered against the bond. On the same day, the accused and the bondsman filed a motion explaining that her delay was caused by a fire. On September 18, 1963, after the accused had surrendered, the trial court denied the motion to lift the confiscation but reduced the forfeiture to 20% of the bond, rendering judgment against the bondsman immediately. The bondsman appealed, arguing that under Section 15, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court, the trial court could not render judgment until the 30-day period had fully expired.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the trial court may render judgment on the bond before the expiration of the 30-day period granted to the bondsman.
2. W/N the trial court abused its discretion in determining the merit of the bondsman's explanation.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court held that the 30-day period provided in Section 15, Rule 114 is merely the time allowed for the bondsman to comply with two requisites: (1) produce the body of the principal or give the reason for non-production; and (2) explain satisfactorily the non-appearance. If the bondsman complies with these requisites before the period expires, the court is not required to wait for the lapse of the full 30 days. There is no point in deferring judgment once the accused has been produced and the explanation submitted, as the matter is already ripe for resolution [1].

2. **NO.** The determination of whether the explanation for the principal's failure to appear is meritorious lies within the discretion of the trial court (*People vs. Alamada*, 89 Phil. 1). In this case, the trial court found the explanation not entirely satisfactory but sufficiently mitigating to reduce the liability to 20% of the bond. The Supreme Court found no reason to disturb this exercise of discretion [2].

**Order affirmed.**
