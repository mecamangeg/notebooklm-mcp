I. CAPTION
NATIONAL MARKETING CORPORATION v. ATLAS TRADING DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION and the ALTO SURETY & INSURANCE CO., INC., G.R. No. L-21979, September 29, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On August 5, 1948, the Philippine Relief and Trade Rehabilitation Administration (PRATRA), the predecessor of petitioner National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO), entered into a contract with defendant Atlas Trading Development Corporation (Atlas), acting as sales broker for West India Commercial Corp. of New York [1]. Atlas agreed to sell 8,000 metric tons of galvanized steel sheets at $247 per ton CIF Manila [1]. The contract stipulated that shipments were to be made from August 1948 to February 1949, with a 60-day grace period where late shipments would still be accepted [2]. PRATRA opened a letter of credit (L/C) with the Philippine National Bank on August 26, 1948, in favor of West India [3].

However, the L/C failed to provide for the agreed 60-day grace period [2]. West India received the corrected L/C only on September 7, 1948, making it physically impossible to meet the initial August shipment schedule [2]. Consequently, West India did not deliver the steel sheets, citing serious discrepancies between the L/C and the contract [2, 4]. NAMARCO sued Atlas and its surety, Alto Surety & Insurance Co., Inc. (Alto), for damages and the performance bond [5]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that the failure to establish a sufficient L/C prevented the contract from becoming operative [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the discrepancy between the terms of the letter of credit and the sales contract excused the seller from its obligation to deliver the goods.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal, holding that a material variance between the letter of credit and the sales agreement excuses non-performance by the seller [7].

The Court cited *Sycip v. National Coconut Corp.*, stating that the failure to open a letter of credit within the agreed period or terms prevents a binding juridical tie from being created [8]. When legal relations arise from a letter of credit, the letter itself contains the entire contract of the parties [9]. It is independent of the contract of sale and is unaffected by any breach or controversy arising from the sales contract [9]. Because PRATRA failed to strictly comply with the conditions of the offer by opening an L/C that mirrored the agreed grace period, no liability arose for the non-delivery [10]. Consequently, neither the agent (Atlas) nor the surety (Alto) could be held liable [10].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, and Angeles concurred [11]. Justice Bengzon, J.P. was on leave [11].
