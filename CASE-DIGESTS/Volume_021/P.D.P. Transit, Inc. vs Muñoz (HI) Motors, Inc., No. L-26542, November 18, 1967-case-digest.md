I. CAPTION
P.D.P. TRANSIT, INC. and EUSEBIO DAPLAS v. MUÑOZ (HI) MOTORS, INC., DM TRANSIT, INC., and ALFREDO ABEJA, G.R. No. L-26542, November 18, 1967, 21 SCRA 1008, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs P.D.P. Transit, Inc. and Eusebio Daplas purchased ten trucks on installment from defendant Muñoz (HI) Motors, Inc., securing the obligation with chattel mortgages [1]. Muñoz (HI) Motors later extra-judicially foreclosed on the mortgages [2]. In the resulting auction sale conducted by the Deputy Sheriff, the trucks were sold along with Daplas' Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC), which plaintiffs alleged was never included in the mortgage [3]. The CPC was subsequently transferred to DM Transit, Inc. [4].

Plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon City to annul the auction sale, alleging fraud, lack of notice, and that the CPC was illegally included in the foreclosure [5, 6]. The CFI dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that under Section 20 of the Public Service Act, the Public Service Commission (PSC) had exclusive power over the sale and transfer of franchises [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to determine the validity of an auction sale involving a Certificate of Public Convenience allegedly tainted by fraud.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the Public Service Commission is not a judicial tribunal; its functions are limited and administrative in character [9]. It possesses only such power as expressly conferred by statute and cannot pass upon questions within the exclusive province of ordinary courts [9].

While the PSC is authorized to determine if a transferee is qualified to serve the public interest, it has no jurisdiction to decide on the validity of the auction sale, the due execution of the instruments, or allegations of fraud [10]. These issues properly belong to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of justice [10].

The order of the lower court was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** for further proceedings [11].
