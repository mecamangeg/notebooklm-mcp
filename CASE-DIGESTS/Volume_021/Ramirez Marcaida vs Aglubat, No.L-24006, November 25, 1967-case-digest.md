I. CAPTION
JOSEFINA JUANA DE DIOS RAMIREZ MARCAIDA v. LEONCIO V. AGLUBAT, in his capacity as Deputy Local Civil Registrar of Manila, G.R. No. L-24006, November 25, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ramirez Marcaida, a Filipino citizen resident in Madrid, Spain, was adopted by Maria Garnier Garreau, also a resident of Madrid. The adoption proceedings were initiated before the Court of First Instance of Madrid, which approved the application on October 21, 1958. In compliance with Spanish law (Article 177 of the Civil Code of Spain), a notarial document of adoption (*Escritura de Adopcion*) was executed on November 29, 1958, embodying the court order. This document was authenticated by the Philippine Vice Consul in Madrid. On January 15, 1959, the petitioner sought to register the *Escritura* with the Local Civil Registrar of Manila. Respondent Aglubat refused registration, arguing that under Philippine law, adoption can only be had through judicial proceedings, not by a notarial document. Petitioner filed a petition for mandamus, which the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed, upholding the Registrar's refusal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a foreign adoption evidenced by a notarial document, rather than a judicial decree as required by domestic law, is registrable in the Philippine Civil Registry.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court reversed the lower court's decision. Section 1 of Act 3753 (Civil Registry Law) and Articles 407 and 408 of the Civil Code explicitly mandate the registration of "adoptions" regarding the civil status of persons. The mandatory tenor of the word "shall" in these provisions leaves no alternative.

The Court rejected the respondent's argument based on Article 409 of the Civil Code and Section 11 of Act 3753, which refer to the duty of Clerks of Court to register judicial decrees. The Court held that these provisions apply specifically to adoptions effected in the Philippines and do not imply a prohibition against registering foreign adoptions. Limiting registration to local judicial decrees is a misconception; if the law intended to limit registration to local adoptions, Congress would have expressly stated so.

Furthermore, under Private International Law, the status of adoption created by the law of a State having jurisdiction to create it must be recognized in another State, unless it contravenes public policy. Implicit in Article 15 of the Civil Code is that while the exercise of incidents to foreign adoption remains subject to local law, the status itself is entitled to recognition and registration. The petition was granted, and the Local Civil Registrar of Manila was directed to register the deed of adoption.
