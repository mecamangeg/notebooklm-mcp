I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DOMINGO BATO, G.R. No. L-23405, December 29, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On April 3, 1959, between 6:30 and 7:00 p.m., Aurelio Laguna was having dinner with his family in their house in Babatngon, Leyte. While his back was facing a half-opened window, he was shot from outside, sustaining a fatal wound that caused his death the following day. Immediately after the gunshot, the victim told his wife, Emilia Rosales, that Domingo Bato was the assailant. He reiterated this identification to the barrio lieutenant, the mayor, and the police.

Prosecution witnesses, including the victim's wife and daughter-in-law, testified that they saw Bato near the house with a gun immediately after the shooting, accompanied by two others holding bolos. The area was illuminated by lights from the house and a nearby bonfire. Bato pleaded alibi, claiming he was in a *camarin* about 800 meters away. The Court of First Instance of Leyte convicted Bato of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the identification of the accused as the assailant is established beyond reasonable doubt despite his defense of alibi.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The identity of the assailant was established beyond doubt by the corroborating testimonies of eyewitnesses who saw the accused at the scene and running away immediately after the shot was fired. This was further confirmed by the victim's spontaneous statements identifying Bato as the shooter right after the occurrence.

The Court also found that motive was established, as the victim had previously reported Bato for illegal possession of firearms and slaughtering a carabao, and had been involved in land disputes against Bato's uncle. The defense of alibi was rejected because the alleged location of the accused was only 800 meters away from the crime scene, making it physically possible for him to be present at the time of the shooting. The crime was qualified by treachery, as the victim was shot from behind while eating. The decision appealed from is affirmed.
