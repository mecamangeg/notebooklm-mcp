I. CAPTION
GERTRUDES F. CUAYCONG, ET AL. v. LUIS D. CUAYCONG, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21616, December 11, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Eduardo Cuaycong died in 1936, leaving his properties to his heirs, except for two haciendas titled in the name of defendant Luis D. Cuaycong [1]. In 1961, plaintiffs (surviving children of Eduardo’s deceased siblings) filed a suit for conveyance of inheritance and accounting [2]. They alleged that Eduardo had an arrangement with Luis and his father Justo Cuaycong to hold the haciendas in trust for Eduardo’s siblings and to deliver their shares later [3, 4]. Plaintiffs specifically averred that Eduardo *expressly* told Justo and Luis of this intention [5]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, ruling that the alleged trust was an express trust over an immovable which, under Article 1443 of the Civil Code, cannot be proved by parol evidence [6]. Plaintiffs failed to amend the complaint to allege a written instrument, admitting none existed, but argued the trust was implied [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the alleged trust is an express trust over an immovable requiring written evidence.
2. W/N the action has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The trust is express and unenforceable without written evidence. Article 1441 defines express trusts as those created by the intention of the trustor or parties, while implied trusts arise by operation of law [8]. Since the complaint alleged that the trustor "expressly told" the defendants of his intention to establish the trust, it constitutes an express trust [9]. Under Article 1443 of the Civil Code, an express trust over an immovable cannot be proved by parol evidence [10]. Plaintiffs' reliance on Article 1453 (implied trust) is misplaced because that article applies only when the grantor *does not* expressly state their intent to establish a trust [11].

2. **YES.** Even if the trust were implied, the action has prescribed. The right to enforce an implied trust prescribes in ten (10) years [11]. Plaintiffs alleged that demands for their share were made and refused as early as 1936; since the complaint was filed only in 1961, the action is barred by prescription [11].

The order of dismissal is AFFIRMED [12].
