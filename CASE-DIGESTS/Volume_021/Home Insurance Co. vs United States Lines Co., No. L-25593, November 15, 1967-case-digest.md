**I. CAPTION**
HOME INSURANCE COMPANY v. UNITED STATES LINES CO., REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, and BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-25593, November 15, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
In 1964, the SS "Pioneer Moon" discharged a cargo of adding machine rolls to the custody of the Bureau of Customs as arrastre operator. The cargo was delivered to the consignee, Burroughs, Limited, with damages amounting to P2,605.64 [1]. The Home Insurance Company, having insured the cargo, paid the claim and, as subrogee, filed an action for recovery of sum of money against the United States Lines Co. (carrier) and the Republic of the Philippines and Bureau of Customs (arrastre operators) in the alternative [1, 2]. The Republic and Bureau of Customs raised the defense of non-suability of the State [2].

During the pre-trial conference on December 7, 1965, only the counsel for the plaintiff appeared. When asked for written authority to compromise, the counsel admitted he had none but claimed he had verbal authority from the plaintiff [3]. Consequently, the Court of First Instance dismissed the case for failure of the plaintiff to appear. The plaintiff's motion for reconsideration was denied, prompting this appeal [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs may be sued for the performance of arrastre operations.
2. W/N the lower court erred in dismissing the complaint for the plaintiff's failure to appear at the pre-trial conference despite the presence of counsel claiming verbal authority to compromise.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Republic of the Philippines and its agencies enjoy immunity from suit regarding arrastre operations [4]. The Court held that, based on public policy, the government cannot be sued for performing arrastre operations because this function is necessarily incidental to the governmental function of taxation [4]. The Court reiterated the doctrine laid down in *Mobil Philippines Exploration v. Customs Arrastre Service* [4].

2. **NO.** The dismissal was proper. Section 1, Rule 20 of the Revised Rules of Court makes pre-trial mandatory and explicitly requires "the parties and their attorneys" to appear [5]. This differs from the old Rules which only required attorneys to appear. The purpose is to compel parties to appear personally to reach a compromise if possible [5]. While Section 23, Rule 138 requires attorneys to have "special authority" to compromise, and does not strictly require it to be in writing, the Court is not bound to accept a self-serving assertion of verbal authority [6]. Authority to compromise is not lightly presumed. Since the plaintiff failed to appear and the judge was not satisfied with the counsel's claim of verbal authority, the dismissal of the suit was sanctioned by the Rules of Court [6].

The appealed order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED** [7].
