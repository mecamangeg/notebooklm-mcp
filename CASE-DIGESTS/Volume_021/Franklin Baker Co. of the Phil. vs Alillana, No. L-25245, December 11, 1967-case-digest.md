**I. CAPTION**
FRANKLIN BAKER COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MAURICIO ALILLANA and WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-25245, December 11, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Mauricio Alillana, an employee of Franklin Baker Company, contracted pulmonary tuberculosis and retired in July 1958. He filed a claim for disability compensation. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded him benefits under Section 14 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, calculated at 60% of his wages for the maximum period of 208 weeks, totaling P3,015.06 [1, 2]. The company paid this amount in July 1964, and Alillana signed a satisfaction receipt [3]. shortly after, Alillana filed a motion for additional compensation due to continuing disability. After a physical examination confirmed his condition, the WCC awarded additional compensation of P984.94, raising the total to the statutory maximum of P4,000 [3, 4]. The company moved for reconsideration, arguing the disability period could not exceed 208 weeks. The WCC denied the motion, ruling that Section 18 allows for the extension of the disability period [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the WCC has the power under Section 18 to extend the period of disability compensation beyond the 208 weeks fixed in Section 14.
2. W/N the satisfaction receipt signed by the employee constitutes a valid waiver of further claims.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the maximum period of 208 weeks fixed in Section 14 can be extended under Section 18, as amended by Republic Act No. 772 [5]. The amendment to Section 18 empowers the Commissioner to reopen a case and cause the examination of a disabled laborer "with a view to extending, if necessary, the period of compensation," provided the aggregate sum does not exceed the statutory limit (P4,000 at the time) [6]. Citing *Avecilla Building Corporation v. WCC*, the Court emphasized that this innovation was intended solely for the benefit of the employee to address changes in their condition [5, 7].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the employee's signature on a satisfaction receipt does not result in a waiver. Under Section 29 of the Act, the law does not consider valid any agreement to receive less compensation than what the worker is entitled to recover [8].

The appealed order of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is **AFFIRMED**.
