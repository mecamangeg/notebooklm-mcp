I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO PERIQUET v. HON. JUDGE ANDRES REYES, COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23886, December 29, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Maria Suarez (deceased wife of petitioner Francisco Periquet) was an incorporator of Suarez Estate, Inc., contributing parcels of land registered in her name. After her death, and the death of another incorporator, the corporation failed to formally organize. To settle the dispute, the parties in Civil Case No. 7300 entered into a Compromise Agreement to return the capital contributions to the incorporators or their heirs [1-3]. Periquet, assisted by counsel, drafted the agreement and signed it as the "surviving spouse" of Maria Suarez [4, 5].

The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal rendered judgment on March 9, 1964, approving the compromise and adjudicating specific lots to Periquet as the representative of his deceased wife's share [6, 7]. Periquet later filed a motion to set aside the agreement, alleging "mistake": he claimed he signed under the belief that the share was allotted to him in his personal capacity, not as a representative [8]. The CFI denied the motion and subsequently disallowed Periquet's appeal on the ground that a judgment on compromise is not appealable [4, 9]. Periquet filed a petition for Certiorari and Mandamus with the Supreme Court [10].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the judgment on the compromise agreement may be appealed or set aside on the ground of mistake.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition. Generally, a judgment on a compromise agreement is immediately executory and not appealable, as the agreement implies a waiver of the right to appeal [11]. An exception exists if a party moves to set aside the agreement on the ground of fraud, mistake, or duress; in such cases, an appeal is allowed from the order denying the motion [11].

However, the "mistake" alleged by Periquet does not invalidate consent under Article 1331 of the Civil Code, which requires the error to refer to the substance of the thing or the principal conditions of the contract [12]. Periquet's claim that he intended to sign in his personal capacity contradicts the explicit terms of the agreement he and his counsel drafted [5]. Furthermore, a miscalculation or misappreciation of the legal import of a compromise, where the party is assisted by counsel, is not a basis for setting it aside [13]. A compromise entered into and carried out in good faith will not be discarded even if there was a mistake of law or fact [13]. Granting Periquet's claim would also violate the laws of succession by depriving other heirs of their legitime [13].

**Petition dismissed.** [14]
