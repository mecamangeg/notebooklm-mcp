I. CAPTION
NATIONAL WATERWORKS & SEWERAGE AUTHORITY v. DATOR, G.R. No. L-21911, September 29, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
This case is a sequel to *Municipality of Lucban v. NAWASA* (1961), where the Supreme Court declared the Municipality of Lucban the owner of the "Apolinario de la Cruz Waterworks System," subject to the jurisdiction, control, and supervision of the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) [1]. Following this, respondent Mayor Hobart Dator issued a memorandum directing the Municipal Treasurer to collect water rentals from consumers [2]. NAWASA filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Quezon to declare the Mayor in contempt, arguing that the collection of fees constituted defiance of the Court’s previous decision regarding NAWASA's supervisory power [3, 4]. The lower court dismissed the petition, ruling that the collection of fees and appointment of personnel were acts of internal management not included in NAWASA's regulatory powers [3]. NAWASA appealed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipality of Lucban has the authority to fix and collect water rents despite NAWASA's power of supervision and control.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the authority of a municipality to fix and collect rents for water supplied by its waterworks system is expressly granted by law, specifically Section 2317 of the Revised Administrative Code and Section 2 of Republic Act No. 2264 [5, 6]. Even without these provisions, the authority is justified by the municipality's inherent power to administer its private property [6]. The ownership of the waterworks is vested in the municipality in its proprietary capacity, and like any private owner, it enjoys the attributes of ownership under Articles 424 and 428 of the Civil Code, including the right to use and enjoy the property (*jus utendi* and *fruendi*) [6, 7]. If NAWASA were allowed to collect the fees, the municipality would be deprived of the full enjoyment of its property [7].

The Order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [8].
