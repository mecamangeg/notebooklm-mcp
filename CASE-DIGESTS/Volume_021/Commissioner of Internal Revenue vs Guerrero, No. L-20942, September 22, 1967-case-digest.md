I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. A. D. GUERRERO, Special Administrator, in substitution of NATHANIEL I. GUNN, as Administrator of the Estate of the late PAUL I. GUNN, G.R. No. L-20942, September 22, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
The decedent, Paul I. Gunn, was an American national who operated an air transportation business in the Philippines called Philippine Aviation Development [1, 2]. His estate, represented by Administrator Guerrero, filed a claim for a refund of P2,441.93, representing 50% of the specific taxes paid on aviation oil used between October 1956 and May 1957 [2, 3]. The claim was based on Section 142 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), which allows a 50% refund on specific taxes for aviation oil [2]. The Estate argued that under the "Ordinance" appended to the 1935 Constitution (granting "Parity Rights"), American citizens were entitled to the same rights and privileges as Filipino citizens, including tax privileges [2].

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) denied the refund, ruling that the partial exemption under Section 142 is available to foreigners only if their country grants a similar exemption to Filipinos (reciprocity), which the Estate failed to prove [2, 3]. On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) reversed the CIR and ordered the refund, holding that the Ordinance justified the exemption without need for reciprocity [3]. The CIR appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N American citizens are entitled to the tax refund under Section 142 of the NIRC by virtue of the Parity Rights Ordinance, even without establishing reciprocity.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Ordinance does not grant tax exemptions or refunds to American citizens [4].

The Court applied the principle that tax exemptions are not favored and are never presumed; they must be expressed in language that admits of no doubt and construed *strictissimi juris* against the taxpayer [5, 6]. The Ordinance grants US citizens parity rights only regarding the "disposition, exploitation, development, and utilization" of natural resources and the "operation of public utilities" [7]. It contains no categorical language granting tax exemptions or refunds [4, 5].

Furthermore, the Ordinance was a transitory provision intended for a limited period [8]. It should not be interpreted to expand beyond its explicit terms or to trench upon the Constitutional mandate limiting public utilities to Filipinos beyond the parity period [8]. Since the Ordinance does not supply the exemption, the respondent must comply with the statutory requirement of reciprocity under Section 142 of the NIRC [9, 10].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **REVERSED**, and the case is remanded to the CTA to allow the respondent the opportunity to prove reciprocity [10].
