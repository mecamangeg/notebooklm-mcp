I. CAPTION
HARTFORD FIRE INSURANCE CO. v. CUSTOMS ARRASTRE SERVICE and/or BUREAU OF CUSTOMS and/or REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, No. L-25362, October 23, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellant Hartford Fire Insurance Co. (Hartford), as insurer and subrogee of the consignee Earnshaw Docks & Honolulu Iron Works, filed a complaint for a sum of money against the Customs Arrastre Service, the Bureau of Customs, and the Republic of the Philippines. This action arose from a shipment of nickel Babbitt discharged into the custody of the Customs Arrastre Service on July 15, 1964, which was found to have suffered a loss of 1,356 pounds worth P12,572.00 upon delivery to the consignee. After paying the insurance claim, Hartford sought reimbursement from the defendants. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the case, sustaining the defense that the defendants are immune from suit. Hartford appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Customs Arrastre Service and the Republic of the Philippines may be sued for acts done in the performance of the arrastre service.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the defendants are not suable. Relying on the doctrine established in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service* (L-23139, December 17, 1966), the Court held that a non-corporate government entity performing a function proprietary in nature is not suable if said function is undertaken as an incident to its governmental function. The Bureau of Customs operates the Arrastre Service as an incident to its primary governmental function of assessing and collecting lawful revenues. Consequently, for obvious reasons of public policy, it cannot be sued. This immunity extends to the Republic of the Philippines in relation to the operation of the Bureau of Customs.

The judgment appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
