I. CAPTION
AUYONG HIAN v. THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-23395, October 31, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On September 1, 1958, the Republic filed a suit (Civil Case No. 37371) against Auyong Hian in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to collect deficiency income taxes for the years 1946 to 1951. The CFI ruled in favor of the Republic [1]. Auyong Hian appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the decision *in toto* on September 20, 1966 [2]. He then filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-26790), which was dismissed for lack of merit; this dismissal became final and executory on March 31, 1967 [2].

Meanwhile, on September 9, 1963, while the collection suit was pending, Auyong Hian filed a "Petition for Review" with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) questioning the correctness of the very same tax assessments [3]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) moved to dismiss the petition on the grounds that the CTA lacked jurisdiction due to the lapse of the 30-day appeal period and that there was another action pending between the parties [3]. On March 3, 1964, the CTA dismissed the case [4]. Auyong Hian appealed this dismissal to the Supreme Court. The Solicitor General moved to dismiss the current appeal, arguing the issues had become moot and academic due to the finality of the decision in the collection case [1], [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal from the Court of Tax Appeals should be dismissed for being moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.

There is an identity of subject matter between the civil collection case (Civil Case No. 37371) and the CTA case (CTA Case No. 1449), as both involve assessments for deficiency income taxes for the years 1946 to 1951 in the aggregate sum of P160,223.13 [5]. The judgment in the civil case was affirmed by the CA and the petition for certiorari questioning it was denied by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-26790 [5].

With the finality of the Supreme Court's resolution in the previous case, the question regarding the amount of Auyong Hian's deficiency taxes became a settled matter, and the correctness of the assessments may no longer be inquired into [6]. The Court cited *Dy Cay v. Crossfield & O’Brien*, reiterating that public policy and sound practice demand that judgments of courts should become final at some definite date fixed by law to put an end to controversies [6]. Consequently, the present appeal constitutes a moot and academic issue [7].

Appeal dismissed [8].
