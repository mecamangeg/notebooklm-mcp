I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CARLOS CLEMENTE and ROSALIO CLEMENTE, G.R. No. L-23463, September 28, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On February 5, 1962, in Lavezares, Samar, Reyes Matnog (barrio lieutenant) and accused Rosalio Clemente had a quarrel. Rosalio stabbed Matnog, who ran away and fell to the ground. Rosalio pursued him and stabbed him again. Prosecution witness Pablito Seriguini testified that Rosalio's brothers, accused Carlos and Pascual Clemente, joined the pursuit and attacked the prostrate victim. Matnog died of multiple wounds.

The trial court convicted Carlos and Pascual of Murder qualified by treachery, sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua*, ruling they attacked the victim while he was defenseless. Rosalio was convicted of Homicide, claiming self-defense, which the court rejected. The court also denied Rosalio the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender because it was induced by fear of retaliation. The brothers appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Rosalio Clemente acted in self-defense.
2. W/N Rosalio Clemente is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.
3. W/N the crime committed was Murder.
4. W/N Carlos and Pascual Clemente are liable as principals.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The burden of proving self-defense lies with the accused. The autopsy revealed two stab wounds inflicted from behind, contradicting Rosalio's claim of a frontal clash. Furthermore, his witness was discredited by the physical evidence regarding the location of Rosalio’s own minor injury [1].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that Rosalio's surrender to the authorities immediately after the incident entitles him to the mitigating circumstance. The fact that he surrendered out of fear of retaliation by the victim's relatives does not negate the spontaneity of the act, nor alter the fact that it saved the State the time and trouble of searching for him [2]-[3].

3. **NO.** The crime is **Homicide**. The attack was the result of a "chance encounter and quarrel." There was neither premeditation nor treachery. The wounding of the victim while lying on the ground was merely incidental to the pursuit and not intended to ensure the safety of the attackers. Thus, the qualifying circumstance of treachery was not present [4].

4. **NO.** Carlos and Pascual are liable only as **accomplices**. While the witness saw them join the pursuit and attack, he could not positively assert that they managed to hit the fallen man. There was no showing of conspiracy. Since the extent of their participation was uncertain, the doubt was resolved in their favor [5].

**Disposition:** The decision is MODIFIED. Rosalio Clemente is convicted of Homicide with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. Carlos and Pascual Clemente are convicted as accomplices to Homicide.
