I. CAPTION
GO BEE BEE @ SIOK KUAN, LIM TAN TONG @ LIM SUY HIO and JOSE LIM @ LIM SIONG HING v. COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21424, November 15, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Go Bee Bee, Lim Tan Tong, and Jose Lim were recommended for deportation by the Deportation Board due to communistic activities, utterance of counterfeit coins, and prostitution [1, 2]. On December 28, 1961, the President of the Philippines issued an order declaring them undesirable aliens and directing their arrest and deportation to mainland China or Formosa [2]. Petitioners were subsequently arrested and detained at Engineer Island [2, 3].

On August 20, 1962, petitioners filed a petition for habeas corpus with the Court of First Instance of Manila, claiming that the December 28 deportation order had been revoked by the President on December 30, 1961 [3]. The lower court ruled in favor of the petitioners, declaring their detention unlawful and ordering their release upon posting a P8,000 bond each [2, 4]. The Commissioner of Immigration appealed, arguing that there was no record of the alleged revocation and that the deportation order was final and executory [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the presidential order of deportation was validly revoked by the President on December 30, 1961. [6]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the documents presented by the petitioners were "utterly insufficient" to prove the alleged revocation and were of an "extremely suspicious character" [1, 7].

The Court cited three main irregularities to support this finding: (1) The petitioners failed to explain how the alleged original of an official document came into their possession; (2) The alleged original did not bear the name of then-President Carlos P. Garcia, whereas the photostatic copy of the alleged duplicate did; and (3) The photostatic copy contained specific "Copy for" remarks that were absent from the alleged original [7, 8]. Furthermore, the Court noted that the alleged revocation was dated December 30, 1961, characterizing it as one of the "midnight" orders of the outgoing administration which are historically dubious [7]. The petitioners thus failed to discharge the burden of proving that the revocation order was validly issued [6].

The appealed decision was **REVERSED** and set aside. The petitioners were ordered rearrested for deportation in accordance with the original presidential order [9].
