I. CAPTION
ALHAMBRA CIGAR & CIGARETTE MANUFACTURING COMPANY v. THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-23226, November 28, 1967, 21 SCRA 1111, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alhambra Cigar & Cigarette Manufacturing Company claimed deductions from its gross income for the years 1954 to 1957 representing salaries, bonuses, commissions, and directors' fees paid to its President, A.P. Kuenzle, and Vice-President, H.A. Streiff [1, 2]. Both officers were non-residents who visited the Philippines only every two years for 5 to 8 weeks [3, 4].

Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) disallowed portions of the claimed deductions. Specifically, the CIR: (1) allowed only P6,000.00 each as annual salary (disallowing the claimed P15,000.00); (2) reduced the bonuses to match the amount paid to the resident Treasurer/Manager, W. Eggmann; and (3) entirely disallowed the commissions and directors' fees [5-7]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the CIR, finding the P6,000 salary reasonable for the limited services rendered, and characterizing the commissions and directors' fees as dividend distributions rather than compensation for services [4, 8]. Petitioner appealed, arguing the compensation was reasonable.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR and CTA correctly disallowed and reduced the deductions claimed for the compensation of petitioner's non-resident officers.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals.

The Court held that the deductibility of compensation under Section 30 of the National Internal Revenue Code depends on whether "personal services" were "actually rendered" and whether the allowance is "reasonable" [9]. The determination of reasonable compensation is a question of fact [10].

The Court applied the doctrine that it is bound by the factual findings of the CTA, particularly when supported by substantial evidence [11]. The CTA found that Kuenzle and Streiff were non-residents whose services did not justify the full amounts claimed. The commissions and directors' fees were correctly treated as dividend distributions given the lack of specific services rendered to warrant them [4]. Furthermore, the Court reiterated that it is inadvisable to set aside the conclusions of the CTA, a specialized agency with expertise in tax matters, absent an abuse of authority [10, 12].

Decision affirmed [13].
