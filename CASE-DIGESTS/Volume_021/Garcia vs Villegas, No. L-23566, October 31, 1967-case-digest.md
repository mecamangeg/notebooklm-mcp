I. CAPTION
ELENA L. GARCIA v. ANTONIO J. VILLEGAS, City Mayor of Manila, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23566, October 31, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
In 1963, petitioner Elena L. Garcia lodged a complaint with the Office of the City Mayor of Manila against members of the Manila Police Department (MPD), alleging she was a victim of illegal arrest. Respondent Mayor Antonio J. Villegas endorsed the complaint to the MPD Inspection Division to determine if there was a cause of action. Garcia contested the jurisdiction of the Inspection Division, arguing that under Republic Act No. 557, it was the Mayor's ministerial duty to immediately file charges with the Municipal Board without a prior investigation by the police.

When her objection was overruled, Garcia filed a petition for mandamus and prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to compel the Mayor to file the charges directly with the Municipal Board. The CFI dismissed her petition. Garcia appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the City Mayor is authorized to conduct a preliminary inquiry into a complaint against police officers before filing formal administrative charges with the City Council/Municipal Board.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision.

While Section 1 of Republic Act No. 557 provides that charges against city police members shall be preferred by the City Mayor and investigated by the City Council, this does not preclude the Mayor from conducting a prior inquiry to ascertain whether a complaint is *prima facie* meritorious or sham. The Court reasoned that holding it as a ministerial duty for the Mayor to file charges upon every complaint, regardless of merit, would make his office an instrument of persecution. The Mayor may delegate this preliminary investigation to capable subordinates, such as the MPD Inspection Division.

The Court distinguished this case from *Covacha v. Amante*, noting that in the present case, no charges had yet been filed, and the inquiry was solely for the Mayor's own information, not a substitution for the trial by the City Council. Furthermore, the Court noted the issue had become academic with the enactment of the Police Act of 1966 (Republic Act No. 4864), which created the Police Commission and removed the requirement that charges be preferred by the Mayor.

**Petition denied. Decision affirmed.**
