I. CAPTION
**JUAN E. SEVILLA v. LEONCIO PARINA, ADAN ROSETE, HONORABLE ABELARDO SUBIDO, HONORABLE JOSE B. LINGAD, and HONORABLE RUFINO HECHANOVA**, G.R. No. L-23797, October 30, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Juan E. Sevilla, a Customs Examiner I, was administratively charged with grave misconduct for possessing untaxed cigarettes and soap [1]. The Civil Service Commission suspended him, but on appeal, the Civil Service Board of Appeals (CSBA) modified the penalty to a reduction of his salary "to that corresponding to the position next lower in rank" [1]. Implementing this decision, the Secretary of Finance appointed Sevilla to the lower position of Clerk II and promoted respondent Leoncio Parina to Sevilla's item as Customs Examiner I [2]. Sevilla filed a *quo warranto* suit in the Court of First Instance of Manila, which ruled in his favor, ordering his restoration as Customs Examiner I with the reduced salary and ousting Parina [2, 3]. The Government appealed, arguing that the salary reduction effectively meant a demotion in position [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the administrative penalty of reducing an employee's salary to that of the next lower rank constitutes a divestment of his current position.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the CSBA's decision was specific: it ordained the reduction of *salary*, not *position* [4, 5]. A public officer may validly hold a position while receiving a salary lower than the maximum budgetary amount allocated for that item [4]. Furthermore, the Board possesses the authority to discipline employees (via suspension, removal, or salary reduction) without requiring a new appointment. To adopt the Government's theory—that a new appointment to a lower position was required—would render the efficacy of the Board's final decisions dependent on the willingness of the appointing authority to exercise its discretion to appoint, which is contrary to law [6].

Decision affirmed [7].
