I. CAPTION
CONSTANTE PIMENTEL v. THE HONORABLE JUDGE ANGELINO C. SALANGA, G.R. No. L-27934, September 18, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Constante Pimentel was the counsel of record in several civil and criminal cases pending before the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur, presided over by Respondent Judge Angelino C. Salanga. Pimentel was also the complainant in a pending administrative case he filed against Judge Salanga with the Supreme Court for alleged serious misconduct, inefficiency, and partiality. Citing this administrative conflict, Pimentel filed a motion seeking Judge Salanga's disqualification from the cases where Pimentel appeared as counsel. Judge Salanga denied the motion, reasoning that an administrative complaint is not a legal ground for disqualification under the Rules of Court and that his withdrawal would delay the proceedings. Pimentel filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court to prevent the judge from sitting in said cases.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a judge is disqualified from hearing cases where the counsel of record for one of the parties is his adversary in a pending administrative case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the judge is not disqualified. Under **Section 1, Rule 137 of the Rules of Court** (formerly Rule 126), the grounds for mandatory disqualification are strictly enumerated (e.g., pecuniary interest, relationship to party or counsel within the prohibited degree). The circumstance of being an adversary in an administrative case is not included in this list.

While the second paragraph of Rule 137 allows a judge to disqualify himself for "just or valid reasons" other than those enumerated, this is a matter of **voluntary inhibition** subject to the judge's **sound discretion**. The Court explained that this discretion allows a judge to inhibit himself but does not compel him to do so if he is not legally disqualified under the first paragraph. Bias or prejudice cannot be presumed simply because a lawyer has filed a complaint against the judge. Consequently, since Respondent Judge Salanga was not legally disqualified and chose not to inhibit himself, he had the official duty to proceed with the cases. However, the Court advised that in such situations, judges should conduct a careful self-examination to ensure their impartiality and preserve the people's faith in the courts.

**Petition denied.**
