I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE EDUCATION CO., INC. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23811, October 30, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On June 17, 1962, the SS "Susan Maersk" discharged 142 cartons of books in Manila, which were received in good order by the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service. On June 21, 1962, less than four days after discharge, the consignee, Philippine Education Co., Inc., filed a provisional claim specifying the marks and number of packages but without stating the precise money value of the damage [1, 2]. A subsequent examination showed shortages in 21 cartons. The consignee filed formal claims in October 1962 for P601.78 [2].

Manila Port Service rejected the claims. The consignee filed suit in the Municipal Court of Manila, which ordered the Port Service to indemnify the plaintiff. On appeal, the Court of First Instance affirmed the decision, awarding P601.78 plus P50.00 in attorney's fees [2]. The Port Service appealed to the Supreme Court on points of law, arguing the provisional claim was insufficient for lacking a value statement, liability should be limited to the invoice value, and attorney's fees were unwarranted [3-5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the provisional claim is invalid for failing to state the precise amount of the loss.
2. W/N the arrastre operator's liability is limited to the invoice value of the goods.
3. W/N the award of attorney's fees is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The absence of a statement regarding the precise amount of loss does not render a provisional claim invalid. It constitutes substantial compliance with Section 15 of the arrastre management contract, provided the claim is filed within 15 days of the cargo's discharge [3]. The Court held, citing *Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. v. United Lines* and *State Bonding & Insurance Co. v. Manila Port Service*, that the purpose of a provisional claim is merely to afford the arrastre operator a reasonable opportunity to check the validity of the claim while the facts are still fresh [3].

2. **NO.** The arrastre operator is liable not only for the invoice value of the goods but also for all damages suffered by the consignee due to the loss, destruction, or injury of the goods [4]. The Court cited *Caltex (Phil.), Inc. v. Manila Port Service* to support this principle. Furthermore, as the case was an appeal on points of law, the amount of damages determined by the trial court was no longer debatable [4].

3. **YES.** The award of attorney's fees is just and equitable under Article 2208, No. 11 of the Civil Code [5]. The Court noted that the Manila Port Service had been systematically rejecting meritorious claims, as evidenced by numerous Supreme Court decisions, compelling claimants to litigate to protect their rights [5].

The appealed decision is **AFFIRMED** [5].
