I. CAPTION
**LAUREANO OLIVA v. NICOLAS V. LAMADRID and ROSA L. VILLALUZ**, G.R. No. L-23196, October 31, 1967, 21 SCRA 738, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Laureano Oliva was the owner of a parcel of land covered by a Homestead Patent and an Original Certificate of Title (OCT). In 1958, he mortgaged the property to the Rural Bank of Daet to secure a P250.00 loan. Upon his default, the property was extrajudicially foreclosed and sold at public auction to the Bank on February 4, 1961 [1]. The Sheriff’s certificate of sale indicated a redemption period of two years. Oliva failed to redeem within two years, leading to the cancellation of his title and the issuance of a new one to the Bank in February 1963. The Bank subsequently sold the land to Nicolas Lamadrid in March 1963 [2].

Before May 31, 1963, Oliva offered to repurchase the property for P350.00, invoking Section 119 of the Public Land Act (Commonwealth Act No. 141), which grants a five-year redemption period for homesteads [3]. The defendants refused, arguing that under Section 5 of Republic Act No. 720 (Rural Banks Act), as amended by R.A. No. 2670, the redemption period is only two years. The Court of First Instance dismissed Oliva's complaint, ruling that Section 5 of R.A. 720 governed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the period to redeem a property covered by a homestead patent foreclosed by a Rural Bank is five years under Section 119 of C.A. No. 141, rather than two years under R.A. No. 720.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The proper period for redemption is five years as provided by Section 119 of Commonwealth Act No. 141.

The Supreme Court held that Section 119 of C.A. No. 141 applies to both voluntary and involuntary conveyances, including foreclosure sales [5]. There is no conflict between this provision and Section 5 of R.A. No. 720. The two-year redemption period in R.A. No. 720 expressly refers to lands "*not covered by a Torrens title*, a homestead or free patent," or lands where titles are still *pending* issuance [6, 7]. Since Oliva's land was already covered by a Homestead Patent and a Torrens title, the specific provisions of R.A. 720 for untitled lands do not apply.

Furthermore, the legislative history of R.A. No. 2670 (amending R.A. 720) reveals a specific intent to preserve the five-year redemption right of homesteaders under the Public Land Act, as the original proposal to set a ten-year period was abandoned in favor of retaining the general law's provisions [8, 9]. Consequently, Oliva’s offer to repurchase in May 1963 was well within the five-year period reckoned from the auction sale in February 1961 [10].

The decision of the lower court is **REVERSED**, and the defendants are ordered to reconvey the property to Oliva [11].
