I. CAPTION
BERNARDINO ABES, et al. v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, et al., G.R. No. L-28348, December 15, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, candidates of the Liberal Party and other groups in the November 14, 1967 elections in Quezon City, alleged massive irregularities, including the use of blank registration forms, active campaigning within polling places, and widespread disenfranchisement of voters [1, 2]. Claiming that over 50% of registered voters failed to vote due to fraud and terrorism, they filed a petition with the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to declare a failure of election, suspend the canvass and proclamation of winning candidates, annul the elections, and call for new ones [3].

On November 23, 1967, COMELEC denied the petition, ordering the Board of Canvassers to proceed with the canvass but to withhold proclamation to allow petitioners to seek a remedy from the Supreme Court [3, 4]. Petitioners filed this petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction, arguing that the election laws mandate free and honest elections and that the tabulated results did not reflect the will of the people [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N COMELEC has the power to order the suspension of canvassing and proclamation based on allegations of irregularities not appearing on the face of the returns.
2. W/N COMELEC has the power to annul an election.
3. W/N COMELEC has the power to order the holding of a new election.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Board of Canvassers is a ministerial body whose duty is limited to the mechanical function of compiling votes as shown on the face of the returns [6]. Neither the Constitution nor the Revised Election Code grants the COMELEC or the Board the power to look beyond the face of the returns once satisfied of their authenticity [7]. Since there was no allegation that the returns were falsified or not genuine, the canvass cannot be suspended [8]. Furthermore, suspending the canvass would paralyze the functions of election bodies and could result in a vacuum in office after the term of incumbents ends on December 31, 1967 [8].

2. **NO.** Section 2, Article X of the 1935 Constitution gives COMELEC the power to enforce and administer election laws, but this does not imply the authority to annul an election [9, 10]. This power is merely preventive, not curative [11]. If the election was not free or honest, the remedy lies with the Senate or House Electoral Tribunals or the courts in election contests, which have the specific power to decide such matters [10, 12]. The power to annul an election is withheld from the COMELEC and entrusted to these other agencies [10].

3. **NO.** There is no constitutional or statutory provision empowering COMELEC to direct a new election after one has already been held [13]. Section 8 of the Revised Election Code allows the President, upon COMELEC recommendation, to *postpone* an election, but this applies only *before* the election takes place, not as a remedy afterward [13, 14]. The Court held that a hiatus in election law regarding failed elections can only be filled by legislation, not judicial fiat [15].

Petition dismissed [16].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Fernando, J. (Concurring):**
Justice Fernando agreed with the decision but wrote separately to highlight the "aching void" in the law regarding the lack of remedy for the grievances cited by petitioners. He emphasized that while the situation exposes serious defects in the electoral process, the judiciary cannot assume legislative power to fill the gap or cure the evil where no authority exists [17-19].
