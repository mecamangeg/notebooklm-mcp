I. CAPTION
THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF ZAMBOANGA DEL NORTE v. DOROTEO DE GUZMAN, CFI Judge, Zamboanga del Norte, and ROBERTO P. POCULAN, Mayor of Rizal, Zamboanga del Norte, G.R. No. L-23523, November 18, 1967, 21 SCRA 957, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On March 7, 1963, the Provincial Governor of Zamboanga del Norte filed an administrative case against Roberto P. Poculan, Mayor of Rizal, for abuse of authority, oppression, and maladministration [1]. The charge stemmed from an incident where Poculan allegedly assaulted and killed one Antonio Arapoc. A separate criminal case for murder was also filed against him [1].

Despite the pending criminal case, the Provincial Board investigated and issued a resolution on February 14, 1964, suspending Poculan for two years [2]. Poculan, who had been reelected, filed a petition for Injunction with the Court of First Instance (CFI). The CFI, presided by Judge Guzman, declared the Board's resolution void, ruling that Poculan's reelection purged him of administrative charges from his prior term [3]. The Provincial Board filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, arguing the court should not have intervened due to Poculan's failure to exhaust administrative remedies (appeal to the President) [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Provincial Board can administratively proceed against the Mayor for an alleged crime not connected to official duties before final conviction.
2. W/N the Mayor was required to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Provincial Board cannot administratively proceed until after a final judgment of conviction is rendered in the criminal case. Under Section 2188 of the Revised Administrative Code, municipal officers may be disciplined for "conviction by final judgment of any crime involving moral turpitude" [5, 6]. The Supreme Court held that the alleged killing was not essentially connected to the performance of official duties [7, 8]. Although the charge alleged "grave abuse of authority," these averments referred to the conditions under which the crime was committed and must be resolved in the criminal case [7, 9]. Thus, the administrative proceeding must be deferred pending the final outcome of the criminal case [7, 9].

2. **NO.** The principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply where the question in dispute is purely a legal one and nothing of an administrative nature is to be done, or where such remedies would be futile [4, 10].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed [11].
