I. CAPTION
ANDRES MANARPAAC, ET AL. v. ROSALINO CABANATAN, THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS and THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF ILOCOS NORTE, G.R. No. L-23300, October 31, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants Manarpaac, et al. alleged they have been in possession of two parcels of land in Batac, Ilocos Norte, since time immemorial [1]. In 1956, defendant-appellee Cabanatan fraudulently applied for a free patent over a larger area that included the plaintiffs' land [2]. A free patent was issued to Cabanatan on November 7, 1959, and the corresponding certificate of title was issued on December 3, 1959 [2]. On December 7, 1960, plaintiffs filed a complaint for the annulment of the title and reconveyance [2]. Cabanatan moved to dismiss, arguing that the action was barred by prescription as it was filed more than one year after the issuance of the patent [3]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, ruling that the action for review of the decree was filed beyond the one-year statutory period [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs' action for reconveyance is barred by prescription for being filed more than one year after the issuance of the free patent.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal. The Court held that possession since time immemorial justifies the presumption that the land was never part of the public domain or had become private property even before the Spanish conquest (*Oh Cho v. Director of Lands*; *Cariño v. Insular Government*) [5]. If the plaintiffs' allegations are true, the land had ceased to be part of the public domain, and the Director of Lands had no authority to dispose of it (*Susi v. Razon*) [6]. Furthermore, the remedy of a landowner whose property is wrongfully registered in another's name is not to set aside the decree, but to file an ordinary action for reconveyance. This remedy respects the decree as incontrovertible but seeks the transfer of the property to the rightful owner. Such an action is distinct from a petition to reopen the decree and may be filed even after the one-year period has lapsed (*Casilan v. Espartero*) [7].

The order of dismissal is set aside and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [8].
