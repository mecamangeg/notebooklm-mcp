I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE SURETY & INSURANCE CO., INC. v. BEATRIZ ZABAL, G.R. No. L-21556, October 31, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Philippine Surety & Insurance Co., Inc. obtained a money judgment against Candido Fajardo. On June 17, 1960, the Sheriff levied on Fajardo's registered land to enforce the judgment, and the notice of levy was registered with the Register of Deeds [1]. However, Respondent Beatriz Zabal had previously purchased the land from Fajardo via a deed of sale dated August 28, 1959. Zabal registered this sale on August 28, 1961, resulting in the issuance of a new title in her name, which carried the annotation of Petitioner’s levy [2].

Zabal filed a case to cancel the annotation, arguing she was already the owner and the levy was irregular [2]. The Court of First Instance dismissed her complaint, ruling the levy superior [3]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision, finding the levy invalid because the Sheriff failed to serve a notice of the levy to the occupant of the property (Zabal), as required by the Rules of Court, despite her being in possession at the time [4, 5]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the levy on execution is valid despite the failure to serve a notice of the levy to the occupant of the property.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the levy was invalid due to non-compliance with statutory requirements. Under Section 7 of the old Rule 59 (now Section 7 of Revised Rule 57), effecting a levy upon realty requires two specific acts: (1) filing the order, description, and notice with the Register of Deeds, and (2) leaving a copy of the same with the occupant of the property [6-8].

The Court emphasized that strict compliance with these provisions is mandatory to make the levy "public and notorious" and to prevent secret liens [6, 9, 10]. Since the Court of Appeals found that no notice was given to Zabal, the occupant, the levy was fatally defective [5, 11]. Service to the registered owner (Fajardo) did not cure this defect because he was not the occupant [11, 12]. Because the levy was invalid, its registration and annotation were ineffective, and the petition was dismissed [5, 13].
