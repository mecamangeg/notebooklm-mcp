I. CAPTION
THE CAPITAL INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC. v. ESTEBAN M. SADANG and MARIA LACHICA, G.R. No. L-18857, December 11, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Capital Insurance subscribed to a bond of P42,000.00 on behalf of Mateo Pinto to guarantee fishpond rentals in favor of Macondray Farms, Inc. [1]. To protect Petitioner, Pinto and Respondents Sadang and Lachica executed an Indemnity Agreement and a Real Estate Mortgage on Respondents' property [2]. The mortgage contained a stipulation limiting the liability secured to "the first P20,000.00 that might be incurred under the bond" [3].

Pinto paid Macondray P19,700.00 but failed to pay the remaining balance. Petitioner, as surety, paid Macondray P24,668.83 to settle Pinto's obligation [4]. Petitioner sued Pinto and Respondents for reimbursement. After foreclosing on other properties, a deficiency of P14,456.44 remained [5, 6]. Petitioner sought to collect this deficiency from Respondents. Respondents contended that under the mortgage stipulation, their liability was limited to the "first P20,000.00" of the obligation; since Pinto had already paid P19,700.00, they were only liable for the remaining P300.00 [6, 7]. The trial court ruled in favor of Respondents, limiting their liability to P300.00 [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Respondents are liable for the deficiency claim beyond P300.00 based on the mortgage contract.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding the Respondents liable only for P300.00. The Court found the stipulation limiting liability to "the first P20,000.00" to be vague and ambiguous [8, 9].

Applying the rules on **interpretation of contracts**, the Court ruled that "the doubt must be resolved against appellant [Petitioner], whose lawyer prepared the document, and in accordance with the real intention of the parties as explained by defendants-appellees" [9, 10]. Consequently, the P19,700.00 paid by the principal debtor was deducted from the P20,000.00 limit, leaving only P300.00. The Court modified the judgment to include 12% interest per annum from the filing of the complaint and ordered the foreclosure of the property in case of non-payment [9, 11].

**Judgment affirmed with modification.**
