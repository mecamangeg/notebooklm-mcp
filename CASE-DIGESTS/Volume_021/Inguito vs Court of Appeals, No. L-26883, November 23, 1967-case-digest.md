I. CAPTION
PORFERIO INGUITO v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and ALFREDO ORQUILLAS, SR., G.R. No. L-26883, November 23, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Inguito and respondent Orquillas were candidates for Mayor of Enrique Villanueva, Negros Oriental in the 1963 elections [1]. Inguito was proclaimed the winner by a margin of one vote [1]. Orquillas filed an election protest in the Court of First Instance (CFI), which ruled that Orquillas won by one vote [2]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the CFI decision, increasing Orquillas' margin to four votes [2]. Inguito appealed to the Supreme Court, challenging the validity of thirteen (13) ballots cast in a single precinct (Precinct No. 5) that were counted for Orquillas [3]. These specific ballots all contained the common feature of the candidate's surname being written twice on the same line [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the thirteen ballots containing the repetition of the candidate's surname on the same line constitute marked ballots.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the ballots were marked and must be invalidated. While the general rule is that a single repetition of a candidate's name does not invalidate a ballot absent evidence of intent to identify, this typically applies to isolated instances in different precincts [5, 6]. However, when thirteen ballots in the same precinct share a common feature—the repetition of a candidate's surname—it evidences a pattern designed to mark said ballots [4, 7]. Furthermore, because the repetition occurred on the *same line*, it cannot be deemed unintentional, innocent, or due to oversight, unlike cases where a name is written on the first line and repeated on the last [4, 7].

Consequently, the 13 ballots were deducted from Orquillas, resulting in Inguito winning by a plurality of nine votes [8].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED**, and petitioner Inguito is declared the winner [9].
