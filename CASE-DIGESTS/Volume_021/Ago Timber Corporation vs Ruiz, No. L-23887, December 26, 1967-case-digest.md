I. CAPTION
AGO TIMBER CORPORATION v. HON. JESUS S. RUIZ, COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF AGUSAN, EXCELLENT MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, SHERIFF OF AGUSAN and SHERIFF OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-23887, December 26, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ago Timber Corporation and respondent Excellent Management Corporation entered into a management contract for logging operations in 1963. On September 30, 1963, Ago Timber revoked the contract due to Excellent Management's alleged failure to perform. Consequently, on October 28, 1964, Ago Timber filed an action for rescission of contract in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila (Civil Case No. 58827) [1, 2].

Subsequently, Excellent Management filed an action for specific performance and injunction against Ago Timber in the CFI of Agusan (Special Civil Case No. 182). While the petition in Agusan bore a handwritten note suggesting receipt on October 24, 1964, the filing fee was only paid on November 6, 1964 [3, 4]. The respondent Judge Ruiz of CFI Agusan issued *ex parte* writs of preliminary injunction and attachment against Ago Timber on November 6, 1964 [5]. Ago Timber moved to dismiss the Agusan case on the ground of *litis pendentia* (pendency of the Manila case), but the court failed to act on it [6]. Ago Timber filed this petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CFI Agusan case should be dismissed due to the pendency of the earlier filed CFI Manila case.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the CFI Manila case was filed earlier and thus acquired jurisdiction first. Although the Agusan petition was physically received earlier, the Court held that the date of filing is reckoned from the payment of the filing fee, which occurred on November 6, 1964—after the Manila case was filed on October 28, 1964 [4]. Under Section 1, Rule 13 and Section 1, Rule 141 of the Rules of Court, the payment of the fee determines the date of filing.

Consequently, since the Manila case was filed earlier and involved the same parties and cause, it was incumbent upon the Agusan court to grant the motion to dismiss as a matter of judicial comity and to prevent confusion that hinders the administration of justice [9]. The acts of the respondent court constituted grave abuse of discretion [10].

The petition is **GRANTED**. The writs of preliminary injunction, attachment, and garnishment issued by the respondent court are set aside and declared null and void. The CFI of Agusan is directed to dismiss Special Civil Case No. 182 [11].
