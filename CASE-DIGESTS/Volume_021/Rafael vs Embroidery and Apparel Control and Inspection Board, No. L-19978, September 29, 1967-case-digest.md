I. CAPTION
**CECILIO RAFAEL v. THE EMBROIDERY AND APPAREL CONTROL AND INSPECTION BOARD, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19978, September 29, 1967, 21 SCRA 336, Makalintal, J.**

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cecilio Rafael, doing business as "El Barato Alce Company," operated a manufacturing bonded warehouse for embroidery products. Congress enacted Republic Act No. 3137, creating the Embroidery and Apparel Control and Inspection Board (the Board) to control and inspect tax-free raw material importations. Section 2 of the Act mandated that the Board be composed of representatives from the Bureau of Customs, Central Bank, Department of Commerce and Industry, and the National Economic Council, to be designated by their respective department heads, plus a representative from the private sector coming from the Association of Embroidery and Apparel Exporters of the Philippines (PAEAE).

The Board was constituted, and PAEAE’s president was designated as the private sector representative. The Board then required petitioner to submit data and pay a P200.00 special assessment fee. Petitioner refused and filed an action for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, arguing that the Act was unconstitutional. The CFI declared Section 2 unconstitutional, ruling the Board illegally constituted. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Section 2 of R.A. 3137 violates the President's appointing power by designating Board members from specific government offices.
2. W/N the requirement that the private sector representative come specifically from the PAEAE constitutes class legislation and violates the equal protection clause.
3. W/N the authority granted to the Board to levy a special assessment constitutes an undue delegation of legislative power.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The arrangement in Section 2 does not deprive the President of his appointing power. The government representatives designated to the Board sit *ex-officio* and merely perform duties in addition to those they already perform under their original appointments. No new appointments are necessary because they do not lose their original positions and are merely on detail. Congress may increase the duties of an existing office without rendering it necessary for the incumbent to be appointed again (*Shoemaker vs. United States*).

2. **NO.** The designation of the PAEAE was not done to favor it but because it is the dominant organization in the field. The law accords no privileges to PAEAE members that are not similarly given to non-members; both are subject to the same benefits and restrictions. Legislation that affects with equal force all persons of the same class is not class legislation (*Meralco vs. Public Utilities Employees Assn.*).

3. **NO.** The Act does not grant the Board arbitrary discretion. It sets a reasonable basis (standard) for the assessment: it is levied on manufactured goods for export and must not exceed 1% of the value of the labor, processing, or finishing costs. The distinction between the invalid delegation of power to legislate and the valid conferring of authority to execute the law is that the latter is exercised under and in pursuance of the law (*Araneta vs. Gatmaitan*).

**ACCORDINGLY**, the judgment appealed from is REVERSED, and Republic Act No. 3137 is declared constitutional.
