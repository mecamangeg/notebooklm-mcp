I. CAPTION
**EMERITO S. CALDERON v. HON. JUDGE AMADOR E. GOMEZ, as Presiding Judge of the Second Branch of the Court of First Instance of Cebu; et al.**, G.R. No. L-25239, November 18, 1967, 21 SCRA 1003, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On September 10, 1965, petitioner Emerito S. Calderon, a congressional candidate, filed a petition for injunction (Civil Case No. 241-BC) with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu, Branch VII, alleging that massive public works projects in the 5th and 6th districts were illegal and violated the Election Law [1]. On September 15, 1965, Branch VII issued a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the respondents and all persons connected with the projects from prosecuting the work and from "making, causing or authorizing payment of any payroll or voucher" or disbursing public funds for said projects [2, 3].

While the injunction was in effect, laborers on the projects filed a petition for mandamus (Civil Case No. R-9053) on October 30, 1965, in the CFI of Cebu, Branch II, presided by respondent Judge Amador E. Gomez [4]. The mandamus suit sought to compel the Provincial Treasurer and Auditor to pay their wages for the period of September 8 to 16, 1965 [4]. Judge Gomez gave due course to the petition [4]. Calderon filed the present petition for prohibition with the Supreme Court, arguing that Branch II's cognizance of the mandamus suit constituted undue interference with the injunction issued by a coordinate court, Branch VII [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a court (Branch II) may take cognizance of a mandamus suit seeking the payment of public funds when a co-equal and coordinate court (Branch VII) has already issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the disbursement of said funds.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the writ of preliminary injunction issued by Branch VII specifically commanded respondents to desist from making or authorizing the payment of any payroll or voucher and from allowing the disbursement of public funds for the questioned projects [7]. The mandamus suit in Branch II, which sought to effect payment of wages, would render the effect of the preliminary injunction nugatory [7].

It is a settled rule that "no court has power to interfere by injunction with the judgments or decrees of a court of concurrent or coordinate jurisdiction having equal power to grant the relief sought" (*Onsingco v. Tan*) [8]. This principle applies with equal logic where another provisional remedy, such as mandamus, is resorted to, as the basic reason for the rule is to avoid confusion and prevent the administration of justice from being hindered [9]. A provisional remedy from one court cannot be utilized to defeat the lawful processes of a co-equal court [9].

The petition was **GRANTED**, and the restraining order against Judge Gomez was made permanent [10].
