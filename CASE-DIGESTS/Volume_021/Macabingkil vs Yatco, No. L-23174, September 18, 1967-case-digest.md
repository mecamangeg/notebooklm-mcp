I. CAPTION
CONCEPCION MACABINGKIL v. HON. NICASIO YATCO, PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF RIZAL, SHERIFF OF QUEZON CITY, IRENE DE LEON and VICENTE LLANES, G.R. No. L-23174, September 18, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Concepcion Macabingkil claimed rights over a lot in Quezon City awarded to her by the People’s Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC) via Board Resolution Nos. 370 and 550 [1, 2]. Respondent spouses Irene de Leon and Vicente Llanes filed Civil Case No. Q-5866 against PHHC to enjoin the implementation of said resolutions and compel PHHC to execute a contract of sale in their favor based on a prior agreement [3, 4]. Macabingkil was not impleaded as a party in this civil case [2, 4].

The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the spouses, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals [5]. Subsequently, an alias writ of execution and a special order of demolition were issued against "squatters" on the premises [3]. Macabingkil, upon being served the orders, filed an urgent petition to lift the writ and demolition order, arguing she was not a party to the case and could not be bound by the judgment [1, 6]. Respondent Judge Yatco denied her petition without a hearing or receiving evidence [7]. Macabingkil filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition before the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner was denied due process when the judgment and demolition order were enforced against her despite not being a party to the case.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner was denied due process because she was at no time named a party in the ejectment case (Civil Case No. Q-5866) and could not be heard on a matter wherein her vital rights were involved [4, 8].

Procedural due process requires a law "which hears before it condemns, which proceeds upon inquiry and renders judgment only after trial" and contemplates notice and an opportunity to be heard before judgment is rendered affecting one's person or property (*Lopez v. Director of Lands*; *Banco Espanol-Filipino v. Palanca*) [8]. A writ of execution cannot legally be enforced against a person who was not given their day in court (*Sicat v. Reyes*; *Hamoy v. Batingolo*) [9, 10]. As a stranger to the case, the judgment cannot bind the petitioner.

The petition for certiorari and prohibition is **GRANTED** and the preliminary injunction issued is made permanent [11].
