I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. HAWAIIAN-PHILIPPINE COMPANY, G.R. No. L-16315, October 10, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On May 15, 1967, the Clerk of Court issued an Entry of Judgment *Nunc Pro Tunc*, certifying that the Supreme Court’s decision dated May 30, 1964—which reversed the lower court’s ruling—had become final and executory in accordance with the Court’s resolution of March 15, 1967 [1, 2]. After being served with the Entry of Judgment, respondent Hawaiian-Philippine Company filed an urgent motion on May 23, 1967, requesting to be furnished with a copy of the March 15, 1967 resolution, alleging it had not been served with notice of said resolution [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a party is entitled to be furnished with a copy of a Supreme Court resolution directing the Clerk of Court to make an entry of judgment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that where a resolution is addressed exclusively to the Clerk of Court for the specific purpose of making the corresponding entry of judgment, the parties to the case are not entitled to notice thereof [3, 4]. Such resolutions are administrative directives to the Clerk, distinct from resolutions that require service upon the parties [2, 4].

Consequently, the respondent's urgent motion was denied [4].
