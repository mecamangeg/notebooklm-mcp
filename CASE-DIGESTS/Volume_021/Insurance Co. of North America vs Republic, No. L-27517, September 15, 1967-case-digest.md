I. CAPTION
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and CUSTOMS ARRASTRE SERVICE, G.R. No. L-27517, September 15, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Allied Manufacturing & Trading Company, Inc. imported 15 cases of various automotive parts. Upon arrival, the shipment was discharged into the custody of the Customs Arrastre Service, but one case was lost. As the insurer, the Insurance Company of North America paid the consignee the value of the lost case (P4,469.80) and, as subrogee, filed an action for recovery against the Republic of the Philippines and the Customs Arrastre Service in the City Court of Manila [1].

The City Court and originally the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila ruled in favor of the insurer. However, following the Supreme Court's decision in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. vs. Customs Arrastre Service* (1966), the CFI set aside its decision and dismissed the case due to the non-suability of the defendants. The insurer appealed, arguing that *Mobil* did not apply because the Republic was not a party in that case, whereas it is a named defendant here and allegedly possesses the personality to be sued [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Republic of the Philippines is immune from suit regarding its arrastre operations.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Republic is immune from suit without its consent. The Court held that in performing arrastre operations through the Bureau of Customs or the Customs Arrastre Service, the Republic performs a necessary incident of the primary governmental function of assessment and collection of lawful revenues, tariffs, and customs duties [3].

Additionally, the Court noted that the proper remedy for such money claims is filing with the Auditor General under Commonwealth Act No. 327. The Court rejected the argument that the claim was unliquidated and thus outside the Auditor General's jurisdiction, stating that claims where amounts are fixed or easily determinable from shipping records are considered liquidated [3].

The dismissal order is affirmed [4].
