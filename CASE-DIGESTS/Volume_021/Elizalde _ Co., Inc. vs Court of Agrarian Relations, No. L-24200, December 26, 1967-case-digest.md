I. CAPTION
ELIZALDE & CO., INC., petitioner, vs. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, ASSOCIATED LABOR UNION and PHILIPPINE ASSOCIATION OF FREE LABOR UNIONS, respondents., G.R. No. L-24200, December 26, 1967, 21 SCRA 1386, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Elizalde & Co., Inc. owns and operates five sugar cane plantations (Haciendas Esperanza, Najalin, Consuelo, Balbina, and Cainaman) in La Carlota, Negros Occidental [1]. Respondent Associated Labor Union (ALU) petitioned the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) to hold a certification election for a single bargaining unit covering all workers across the five haciendas [2]. Intervenors PAFLU and CAILO opposed, arguing for separate units for each hacienda and for permanent versus seasonal workers [3].

On August 20, 1964, the CAR ordered separate certification elections for permanent and seasonal workers in each of the five haciendas, reasoning that while owned by one company, the haciendas were administered by different individuals [3]. Petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration was denied on September 12, 1964 [4]. Elections were held, and on January 11, 1965, the CAR issued an order certifying the winning unions [4]. Petitioner received this order on February 4, 1965, and filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court on February 20, 1965, challenging the multiple bargaining units [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for review was filed within the reglementary period.
2. W/N the CAR abused its discretion in designating separate bargaining units for each hacienda and for permanent/seasonal workers.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Sections 1 and 4, Rule 43 of the Revised Rules of Court, an appeal from a final order of the Court of Agrarian Relations must be filed within 15 days from receipt of the order [5]. Petitioner received the order certifying the election results on February 4, 1965, but filed the petition only on February 20, 1965 [6]. Since the filing exceeded the 15-day period, the appeal was time-barred and must be dismissed [6].

2. **NO.** Even if the petition were timely, the Supreme Court held that the determination of what constitutes a proper bargaining unit lies primarily in the discretion of the trial court [6]. No individual factor is given decisive weight by law, and the CAR's decision was supported by the fact that each hacienda had a separate administrator [6]. This separation meant labor conflicts in one plantation would not necessarily involve the others, negating any claim of arbitrariness or abuse of discretion [6].

Petition dismissed [7].
