I. CAPTION
RENATO L. AMPONIN v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS and ROMEO CACANINDIN, G.R. No. L-27420, September 29, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On February 1, 1964, petitioner Renato L. Amponin was appointed by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) as "Election Registrar" without any specification of a particular official station. He was subsequently assigned to San Jose, Occidental Mindoro via a memorandum-directive, where he eventually served as officer-in-charge. However, COMELEC later extended an appointment to respondent Romeo Cacanindin as the permanent election registrar for San Jose and sought to reassign Amponin to another municipality. Amponin filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus, arguing that his assignment and service gave him a vested right and security of tenure in the San Jose office, as well as a preferential right under COMELEC guidelines.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an election registrar appointed without a specific station acquires security of tenure regarding the specific municipality to which they are subsequently assigned.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that an employee is entitled only to such security of tenure as the appointment papers actually confer. Since Amponin's appointment did not specify a particular station, he cannot assert security of tenure over the specific office in San Jose based merely on his subsequent assignment. The Court reiterated the distinction established in *Ibañez v. COMELEC*, holding that an appointment is distinct from an assignment; the appointment is complete upon approval by the Commissioner of Civil Service, and a subsequent assignment does not add to or alter the nature of that appointment. Furthermore, the "guidelines" invoked by Amponin were merely criteria for assignment and did not restrict COMELEC's inherent discretion to appoint permanent registrars (*Braganza v. COMELEC*). Absent a showing of abuse of discretion, the Court will not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission.

The petition is dismissed, and the writ of preliminary injunction is dissolved.
