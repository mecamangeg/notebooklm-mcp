I. CAPTION
EMILIA GABON, ET AL. v. NICANOR G. JORGE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23655, September 30, 1967, 21 SCRA 187, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
The Court of First Instance of Davao (Special Civil Case No. 3593) rendered a decision on January 13, 1964, declaring null and void the orders of the Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources which had cancelled the homestead application of Salvador Ajos. The lower court directed the heirs and tenants of Ajos to vacate the land. The Director of Lands and his correspondents appealed the decision. However, on December 28, 1964, instead of filing an appellant's brief, they filed a notice of voluntary abandonment and withdrawal of their appeal. They stated they decided to follow the lower court's suggestion to file a petition for reversion under Section 101 of the Public Land Act instead. The appellees did not file a brief nor object to the withdrawal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal may be withdrawn by the appellants.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court allowed the withdrawal. The Court noted that the appellants filed a pleading for voluntary abandonment to pursue a petition for reversion under Section 101 of the Public Land Act, which the Court accepted in lieu of a brief. Since the appellees did not file their brief or interpose any objection to the withdrawal, the appeal was considered withdrawn with the effect of dismissal, in accordance with Sections 2 and 4 of Rule 50 of the Rules of Court. The appeal was withdrawn.
