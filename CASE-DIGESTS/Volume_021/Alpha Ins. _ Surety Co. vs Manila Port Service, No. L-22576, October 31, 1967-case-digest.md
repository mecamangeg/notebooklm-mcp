I. CAPTION
ALPHA INSURANCE & SURETY CO. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-22576, October 31, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On May 28, 1961, Manila Port Service (MPS) and Manila Railroad Company received a shipment of 58 packages of "coal tar dyestuffs" for consignee General Textiles, Inc. [1]. The shipment was short one package [1]. The consignee filed a provisional claim on June 5, 1961, within the 15-day period required by the management contract, but did not state the value of the missing cargo [1, 2]. A formal claim stating the value (P600) was filed on March 22, 1962 [2].

The defendants did not reject the claim within one year from the discharge of goods. On June 27, 1962, Alpha Insurance (subrogee of the consignee) received a letter from MPS stating the claim had prescribed [2, 3]. Alpha Insurance filed suit on June 29, 1962, in the Municipal Court of Manila [2]. The Municipal Court and subsequently the Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Alpha Insurance [2, 4]. MPS appealed, arguing the provisional claim was speculative for lacking a value and that the action was time-barred [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the provisional claim was valid despite lacking the value of the missing cargo.
2. W/N the action was barred by prescription under the management contract.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the failure to indicate the value of the missing cargo in the provisional claim is not fatal. The claim contained a description of the importation sufficient to place the defendants on notice and allow for reasonable verification [5]. These circumstances constitute substantial compliance with Paragraph 15 of the management contract [5]. The deficiency was remedied by the subsequent formal claim [7].

2. **NO.** The action was filed within the prescriptive period. Paragraph 15 of the management contract provides two alternative periods for filing suit: (1) one year from the date of discharge, or (2) one year from the date of rejection of the claim [6]. Where the operator fails to act on a claim within one year from discharge, the claim is deemed rejected as of the expiry of that one-year period [6]. Here, the claim was deemed rejected on March 28, 1962 (constructive rejection date cited by the Court), and the complaint filed on June 29, 1962, was well within one year from that date [3].

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED**.
