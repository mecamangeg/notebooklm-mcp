I. CAPTION
SVERIGES ANGFARTYGS ASSURANS FORENING v. QUA CHEE GAN, G.R. No. L-22146, September 5, 1967, 127 Phil. 143, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
In August 1947, defendant Qua Chee Gan shipped 2,032,000 kilos of bulk copra on the *S.S. Nagara* from Siain, Quezon to Gdynia, Poland. The vessel first stopped at Karlshamn, Sweden, where it unloaded 969,419 kilos, before proceeding to Gdynia to discharge the remainder. Polish cargo insurers claimed a cargo shortage at Gdynia and indemnified the consignee. Consequently, the plaintiff, acting as the indemnity insurer for the shipowner, settled the claim by paying approximately $60,733.53 to the Polish insurers.

The plaintiff sued the defendant in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila for reimbursement, claiming it was subrogated to the rights of the carrier or entitled to reimbursement under the Civil Code. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that there was no short shipment and awarding attorney's fees to the defendant. The plaintiff appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the plaintiff can recover the amount paid for the alleged short shipment from the defendant.
2. W/N the award of attorney's fees to the defendant is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The plaintiff cannot recover because it failed to prove the existence of a short shipment. The Supreme Court found that the cargo unloaded in Karlshamn was part of the single shipment intended for Gdynia, contrary to the plaintiff's claim of two separate shipments. The total copra unloaded at both ports actually exceeded the amount loaded at the point of origin, indicating an overshipment rather than a shortage [1]. Under **Article 1236 of the Civil Code**, a third person who pays on behalf of another without the latter's knowledge or consent may only recover to the extent that the debtor has been benefited [2, 3]. Since there was no actual shortage and thus no liability on the part of the defendant, the defendant was not benefited by the plaintiff's payment [3, 4].

2. **NO.** The Court deleted the award of attorney's fees to the defendant. Under **Article 2208, paragraph 4 of the Civil Code**, attorney's fees may be awarded if a civil action is clearly unfounded. However, the facts did not show that the plaintiff's cause of action was so frivolous or untenable as to amount to gross and evident bad faith [5, 6].

**Decision affirmed with modification eliminating the attorney's fees.**
