I. CAPTION
ISIDRO B. RAMOS v. HON. ABELARDO SUBIDO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-26090, September 6, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Isidro B. Ramos, who held civil service eligibility only for the rank of patrolman, was appointed Chief of Police of Tanay, Rizal. His last appointment, dated July 1, 1963, was approved by the Civil Service Commissioner (CSC) subject to the condition that it would last only until he was replaced by an eligible, and in no case beyond thirty days from the receipt of the list of eligibles by the provincial treasurer [1]. The treasurer received said list on April 2, 1964 [1]. Ramos had taken the Chief of Police examination in 1963 but failed [2]. Consequently, on June 11, 1964, Guillermo Castillo, who possessed the requisite Chief of Police eligibility, was appointed to the position [2]. Ramos filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to prevent his removal, arguing that his patrolman eligibility was sufficient to make his appointment permanent [3, 4]. The CFI ruled that Ramos' appointment was temporary and had expired [5]. Ramos appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N patrolman eligibility is appropriate for the position of Chief of Police.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court. It held that one who holds only a patrolman eligibility does not have an appropriate eligibility for Chief of Police [6]. Under **Section 16(b) of Republic Act No. 2260**, the Commissioner has the power to enforce the merit system, and **Section 1, Article XII of the Constitution** requires appointments to be based on merit and fitness determined by competitive examinations [6, 7].

Given the significant difference in rank and duties between a patrolman and a Chief of Police, the requirement for a specific examination for the latter is reasonable [6]. Since Ramos lacked the appropriate eligibility as required by **Section 23 of Rep. Act 2260**, his appointment was merely provisional and validly expired on May 2, 1964—thirty days after the receipt of the list of eligibles [4, 8]. The subsequent appointment of Castillo was therefore valid [8].
