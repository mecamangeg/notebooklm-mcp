**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PANFILO PADERNAL, G.R. No. L-26734, September 5, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Panfilo Padernal was charged with homicide. During arraignment on January 26, 1961, he pleaded guilty but invoked mitigating circumstances, including incomplete self-defense. During the hearing to prove these circumstances, Padernal testified that he wrested the bolo from the deceased and killed him in self-defense. Realizing this testimony constituted a claim of *complete* self-defense, the trial court ordered the plea of guilty withdrawn, entered a plea of not guilty, and reset the case for trial on the merits on January 31, 1961. On the scheduled trial date, both the prosecution and defense chose not to present further evidence and instead adopted the testimonies given during the previous hearing to save time. The trial court subsequently acquitted Padernal on the ground of reasonable doubt. The prosecution appealed, contending that the acquittal was invalid and not a bar to appeal because there was supposedly no true trial on the merits, only a hearing on mitigating circumstances [1-7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the prosecution's appeal is barred by double jeopardy.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that the appeal is barred by the principle of double jeopardy. Unlike in the case of *People v. Balisacan*, the trial court here correctly caused a plea of not guilty to be entered in place of the plea of guilty, which was considered withdrawn by the accused's exculpatory testimony. The trial judge provided both parties sufficient opportunity to prepare for a trial on the merits by resetting the case. The fact that the prosecution and defense chose to adopt the testimonies adduced during the previous hearing as their evidence on the merits does not mean there was no trial; it was a procedural convenience chosen by the parties. Since the requisites of a valid plea, due process, and a trial on the merits were present, the decision of acquittal can no longer be reviewed.

Appeal dismissed [8-11].
