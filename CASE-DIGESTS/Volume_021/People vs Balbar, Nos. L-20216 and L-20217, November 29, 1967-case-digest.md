I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. TIBURCIO BALBAR, G.R. Nos. L-20216 and L-20217, November 29, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On August 29, 1960, Tiburcio Balbar entered a classroom in Lian, Batangas, where schoolteacher Ester Gonzales was conducting classes [1, 2]. Balbar embraced and kissed Gonzales on the eye [1]. When she pushed him away, he drew a dagger, pursued her, and embraced her again while holding the weapon [1]. Two informations were filed against Balbar: (1) Direct Assault Upon a Person in Authority and (2) Acts of Lasciviousness [3]. Balbar moved to quash both. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Batangas quashed the Direct Assault information, ruling it only constituted unjust vexation because it failed to expressly allege that Balbar *knew* the victim was a person in authority [4, 5]. The CFI also quashed the Acts of Lasciviousness information, reasoning the offense was absorbed by the other charge [6, 7]. The Government appealed [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the information for Direct Assault is sufficient despite lacking an express allegation that the accused knew the victim was a person in authority.
2. W/N the information for Acts of Lasciviousness was properly quashed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The information was sufficient. Under Article 152 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by Com. Act No. 578), teachers are deemed persons in authority [8]. The information sufficiently alleged that the accused knew the victim was a teacher engaged in the performance of her duties [9]. Her status as a person in authority is a matter of law, not of fact; ignorance of this legal status does not excuse non-compliance under Article 3 of the Civil Code [9].

2. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, though on different grounds than the lower court. The Court held that "lewd design" is an essential element of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code [10, 11]. Such design is inferred from the nature of the acts and environmental circumstances [11]. Since the acts occurred in a schoolroom in the presence of students and within hearing distance of co-teachers, the inference of lustful design must be ruled out [11].

The order quashing the Direct Assault case is SET ASIDE and remanded for trial, while the dismissal of the Acts of Lasciviousness case is AFFIRMED [12].
