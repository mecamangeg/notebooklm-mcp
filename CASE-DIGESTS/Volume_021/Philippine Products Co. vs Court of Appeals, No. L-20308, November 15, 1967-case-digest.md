I. CAPTION
**PHILIPPINE PRODUCTS CO. and Luis B. REYES, Judge, CFI Manila vs. THE COURT OF APPEALS and PACIFIC COPRA EXPORT CO., INC.**, G.R. No. L-20308, November 15, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On October 19, 1955, petitioner Philippine Products Co. filed Civil Case No. 27913 in the CFI of Manila against Primateria S.A. Zurich (a foreign corporation), which was declared in default [1]. On July 29, 1960, the petitioner obtained an order for execution pending appeal and subsequently an order requiring respondent Pacific Copra Export Co. to be examined regarding its alleged indebtedness to Primateria pursuant to Rule 39, Section 39 [2].

Pacific Copra filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court (L-18361) questioning the lower court's jurisdiction, but the SC dismissed it for lack of merit on May 3, 1961, and denied an amended petition on June 21, 1961 [3, 4]. Despite this final dismissal, Pacific Copra filed an identical petition with the Court of Appeals (CA) on October 18, 1961 [4]. At that time, the main case (Civil Case No. 27913) was already pending appeal before the Supreme Court (L-17160) [5]. The CA granted the petition, prompting Philippine Products Co. to appeal to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari and prohibition when the main case is pending appeal in the Supreme Court.
2. W/N the Court of Appeals may entertain a petition identical to one already dismissed by the Supreme Court.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction. Under Section 30 of the Judiciary Act (Republic Act No. 296), the CA may only issue writs of certiorari and prohibition "in aid of its appellate jurisdiction" [7]. This limits the CA's power to cases where the main appeal falls within its exclusive jurisdiction. Since the main case was actually pending appeal before the Supreme Court, jurisdiction over all incidental matters arising therefrom—including the writs prayed for—rested exclusively with the Supreme Court [5].

2. **NO.** The filing of the very same petition before the Court of Appeals after it had been finally dismissed by the Supreme Court for lack of merit constituted an improper appeal from the highest court to a court of inferior stature [8]. Such procedure violates the orderly set-up of judicial proceedings. While the dismissal of the certiorari petition did not affect the merits of the main case, the dismissal based on "lack of merit" was binding on the certiorari petition itself, preventing an identical petition from being entertained [9].

**Petition granted.** The decision of the Court of Appeals is annulled and set aside *in toto* [9].
