**I. CAPTION**
PHILIPPINE FIRST INSURANCE COMPANY, INC. v. CUSTOMS ARRASTRE SERVICE and REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-26951, September 12, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Philippine First Insurance Company, Inc., as subrogee of the consignee Ong Yet Mua Hardware Co., Inc., filed a complaint for recovery of money against the Customs Arrastre Service and the Republic of the Philippines [1]. This action arose from two separate importations arriving in Manila in September 1963, which were discharged to the Customs Arrastre but suffered short deliveries upon turnover to the consignee [2, 3]. The insurance company paid the consignee a total of P4,461.14 for the losses and sought reimbursement from the defendants [2, 3].

The City Court of Manila dismissed the case for insufficiency of evidence [4]. On appeal, the Court of First Instance ruled in favor of the plaintiff, ordering the Customs Arrastre to pay the amount claimed [4]. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court, raising the defense of state immunity from suit [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Customs Arrastre Service and the Republic of the Philippines can be sued for money claims arising from arrastre operations.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the Bureau of Customs cannot be a party defendant because it is neither a natural nor a juridical person, nor is it an entity authorized by law to be sued [5]. It is merely an arm of the Department of Finance and has no personality of its own apart from the National Government [5].

The Court explained that while arrastre service is a proprietary function, it is a necessary incident to the primary governmental function of assessing and collecting lawful revenues from imported articles [5]. Consequently, the Republic of the Philippines can only be sued with its consent, and no such consent was established in this case [6]. The Court cited *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service* and *Equitable Insurance and Casualty Co., Inc. v. Smith, Bell & Co.* in its reasoning [4, 6].

Finally, the Court held that since the claim is for money, the proper remedy is to file the claim with the Auditor General pursuant to Act 3083 and Commonwealth Act No. 327 [6].

The judgment appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the complaint is **DISMISSED** [6].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando, JJ., concurred with the decision [7].
