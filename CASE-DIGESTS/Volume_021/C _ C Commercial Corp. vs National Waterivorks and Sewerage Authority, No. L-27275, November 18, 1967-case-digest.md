I. CAPTION
**C & C COMMERCIAL CORPORATION v. NATIONAL WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY**, G.R. No. L-27275, November 18, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
The National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) called for bids for the supply of steel and centrifugal cast iron pipes for waterworks projects in Manila, Davao, and Iloilo, requiring pipes ranging from 18 to 42 inches in diameter [1-4]. C & C Commercial Corp. (C & C), a domestic manufacturer of asbestos cement pressure pipes, sought to enjoin the biddings and awards, claiming NAWASA violated Republic Act No. 912 (RA 912) and the Flag Law (Commonwealth Act No. 138) by specifying steel pipes instead of giving preference to locally manufactured asbestos pipes [5-7]. C & C argued that its products were available, practicable, and usable for the projects [5].

The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of C & C, issuing permanent injunctions against NAWASA and ordering new biddings to include asbestos pipes [8, 9]. The lower court held that NAWASA, as a government agency, was bound by the preference laws [10]. NAWASA appealed, arguing it is not "Government" under RA 912 and that C & C’s pipes were not available in the required sizes [10, 11].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N NAWASA is included in the term "Government" under Republic Act No. 912.
2. W/N NAWASA violated RA 912 by specifying steel pipes instead of C & C's asbestos pipes.

IV. RULING
**1. YES.** The term "Government" in RA 912 includes NAWASA [11]. Although NAWASA is a public corporation exercising proprietary functions, RA 912 and Commonwealth Act No. 138 (Flag Law) are statutes *in pari materia* dealing with the same subject matter: the nationalistic policy of developing domestic industries [12, 13]. They must be construed together to attain the purpose of this policy [12]. Thus, "Government" in RA 912 is construed in its implied sense to cover government-owned corporations, not merely the political entity exercising political authority [11, 14].

**2. NO.** NAWASA did not violate RA 912 because the preference for local materials applies only when they are "available, practicable, and usable" [13]. The evidence conclusively showed that C & C had never produced asbestos pipes larger than 12 inches in diameter, while the NAWASA projects required pipes ranging from 18 to 42 inches [15, 16]. C & C’s claim that it *could* produce larger sizes if it purchased new machinery ("mandrils") did not make the materials "available" under the law [17]. Furthermore, RA 912 grants preference only upon certification by the Director of Public Works; C & C’s certification was issued late (July 1966) and only for pipes up to 12 inches [17, 18]. Statutes granting special privileges or advantages to private persons are viewed with suspicion and must be strictly construed [18].

**Disposition:** Decision set aside. The writs of preliminary injunctions issued by the lower court are set aside and declared null and void [19].
