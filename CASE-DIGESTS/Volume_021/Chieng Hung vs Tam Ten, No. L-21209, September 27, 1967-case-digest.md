I. CAPTION
CHIENG HUNG v. TAM TEN, G.R. No. L-21209, September 27, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Chieng Hung was the new lessee of a building in Manila, following the expiration of the lease of the previous tenant. Respondent Tam Ten, a sublessee of the previous tenant, wished to renew his sublease based on an option in his contract, but Chieng Hung refused unless the rent was increased. Tam Ten refused to pay the higher rent or vacate, prompting Chieng Hung to file an illegal detainer case in the Municipal Court [1].

The Municipal Court ruled in favor of Chieng Hung, ordering Tam Ten to vacate and pay P850.00 monthly. Tam Ten appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) [1]. During the appeal, Chieng Hung moved for immediate execution because Tam Ten failed to file a supersedeas bond and deposited the rentals for January and February 1962 only on February 21, 1962. Judge Antonio granted the execution [2]. However, Respondent Judge Arca, who later took over the case, reconsidered and set aside the execution order. Chieng Hung filed a petition for certiorari, arguing Judge Arca committed grave abuse of discretion [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the execution of the judgment for the restoration of possession is mandatory when the defendant fails to make timely rental deposits pending appeal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court granted the petition and set aside the respondent Judge's orders.

Revised Rule 70, Section 8 provides that to stay execution pending appeal in forcible entry or illegal detainer cases, the defendant must deposit the reasonable value of the use and occupation of the premises "on or before the tenth day of each succeeding month or period" [3]. In this case, the rental for January 1962 was deposited only on February 21, 1962, which was eleven days late [4, 5].

The Court held that the rule is mandatory and strictly applied. The appellate court lacks the power to extend the time for making monthly deposits or to excuse defaults [5]. Consequently, the petitioner was entitled to immediate restoration of possession. In refusing to enforce the previous execution order, Judge Arca was guilty of evasion of positive duty, constituting grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction [6].

The writ of certiorari was granted, the orders of the respondent Judge were annulled, and he was directed to issue an execution order for the restoration of possession to the petitioner [6, 7].
