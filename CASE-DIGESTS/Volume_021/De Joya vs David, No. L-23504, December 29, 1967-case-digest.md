I. CAPTION
ALBERTO DE JOYA, as Acting Commissioner of Customs, and PEDRO PACIS, as Acting Collector of Customs v. JUAN T. DAVID and the HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-23504, December 29, 1967, 21 SCRA 1493, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On May 28, 1962, a shipment of 36 crates declared as "stone grinders" arrived in Manila. Upon inspection by Customs and police operatives, the crates were found to contain highly dutiable goods like cigarettes and clothes. The Customs authorities seized the goods for violation of the Tariff and Customs Code (Seizure Identification No. 6439) [1, 2]. Respondent Juan T. David, counsel for the alleged shipper and consignee, moved to dismiss the seizure proceedings and requested the release of the cargo, which the Acting Collector of Customs denied [3, 4].

Instead of exhausting administrative remedies, David filed a Civil Case in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against the Customs officials, seeking a writ of mandatory preliminary injunction for the return of the goods and the nullification of the seizure warrant [5]. The CFI dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction [6]. David appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the Customs officials from hearing the seizure case [7]. The petitioners filed this action for certiorari and prohibition to annul the CA's writ [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeals have jurisdiction to entertain an action for replevin or injunction regarding property subject to seizure and forfeiture proceedings by the Bureau of Customs.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court of First Instance (CFI) has no jurisdiction to replevin property that is the subject of seizure and forfeiture proceedings for violation of the Tariff and Customs Code [9].

The Supreme Court held that the general jurisdiction of the CFI under the Judiciary Act of 1948 must yield to the specific jurisdiction of the Collector of Customs under Republic Act No. 1937 (Tariff and Customs Code), which is the later statute [10]. On grounds of public policy, the legislature intended to divest the CFI of the prerogative to replevin such property; otherwise, actions for forfeiture could be easily undermined by the simple device of replevin [10]. Section 2303 of the Tariff and Customs Code clearly indicates the legislative intent to confine the determination of all questions affecting the disposal of seized property within the Bureau of Customs [11]. The proper judicial recourse for the property owner is not with the CFI, but with the Court of Tax Appeals, and only after exhausting administrative remedies in the Bureau of Customs [11].

Consequently, the Court of Appeals also lacked jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, both because the CFI lacked jurisdiction and because the amount in controversy exceeded P200,000.00 [12].

The petition is **GRANTED**. The writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Court of Appeals is nullified, and the writ issued by the Supreme Court is made permanent. The charge of contempt against respondent David is dismissed for lack of bad faith [13].
