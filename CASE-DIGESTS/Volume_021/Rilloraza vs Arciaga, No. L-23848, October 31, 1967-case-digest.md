**I. CAPTION**
PORFIRIO RILLORAZA v. JUDGE PEDRO ARCIAGA and EULALIA BANAYAT, G.R. No. L-23848, October 31, 1967, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
On June 18, 1963, respondent Eulalia Banayat filed a criminal complaint for direct assault upon a person in authority against petitioner Porfirio Rilloraza in the Municipal Court of San Fernando, La Union. At that time, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 2613 was in force, which granted justice of the peace courts in provincial capitals jurisdiction over offenses where the penalty did not exceed *prision correccional* or a fine of P3,000. On June 22, 1963, four days after the complaint was filed, R.A. No. 3828 took effect, amending the jurisdiction of municipal courts.

Petitioner moved to quash the information on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, which the Municipal Court denied. Petitioner then filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of La Union. The CFI granted the petition, declaring the Municipal Court's proceedings null and void on the ground that the passage of R.A. No. 3828 divested the lower court of jurisdiction.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the subsequent passage of R.A. No. 3828 divested the Municipal Court of its jurisdiction over the pending criminal case.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CFI's order. The Court ruled that the jurisdiction of a court to try a criminal case is determined by the law in force at the time the action is instituted. Since the prosecution was started on June 18, 1963, when R.A. No. 2613 was in effect, the Municipal Court of San Fernando (a provincial capital) had valid jurisdiction over the crime of direct assault, which carries a penalty within the court's competence under said law.

The Court applied the established principle that once jurisdiction to try a criminal case is acquired, it remains with the court until the case is finally determined. A subsequent statute removing jurisdiction will not operate to oust jurisdiction already attached unless express prohibitory words are used (citing *Iburan vs. Labes*). R.A. No. 3828 contains no such prohibitory words. Furthermore, R.A. Nos. 2613 and 3828 are not penal statutes but merely delineate jurisdiction; thus, R.A. No. 3828 cannot be given retroactive effect.

The petition for certiorari and prohibition was dismissed, and the Municipal Court of San Fernando was directed to continue with the case.
