I. CAPTION
THE CITY MAYOR, ENGR. ARTEMIO MATE, ET AL. v. THE CHIEF, PHILIPPINE CONSTABULARY, COL. NICANOR GARCIA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20346, October 31, 1967, 128 Phil. 665, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents, officers of the Philippine Constabulary (PC), believing they had concurrent jurisdiction with the local police, conducted a series of raids on gambling and vice dens in Tacloban City in February 1962. These operations were carried out upon the order of the PC Zone Commander without the prior notice to or consent of petitioner City Mayor Artemio Mate. Petitioners protested, arguing that under the Revised Charter of Tacloban City (Republic Act No. 3068), the city police possessed "exclusive" police jurisdiction. When the respondents ignored the protest, petitioners filed a petition for declaratory relief and injunction with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte. The CFI denied the injunction, ruling that the PC could conduct operations within the city without the Mayor’s consent under the Revised Administrative Code and Commonwealth Act No. 343. Petitioners appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Philippine Constabulary may conduct police operations within Tacloban City without previous notice to or the consent of the City Mayor.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. It ruled that under Section 40 of Republic Act No. 3068 (Revised Charter of Tacloban City), police jurisdiction, supervision, and the preservation of peace and order pertain **exclusively** to the city peace officers (Mayor, Chief of Police, etc.). The term "exclusive" means possessed to the exclusion of others [1], [2].

The Court held that RA 3068, being a special law, prevails over general laws such as the Revised Administrative Code and Commonwealth Act No. 343 to the extent of any repugnancy [3], [4]. Consequently, the PC cannot conduct police operations in Tacloban without the Mayor's prior notice and consent.

However, this exclusive jurisdiction is subject to four exceptions:
1.  When the Mayor calls upon the PC for assistance in cases of riot, public calamity, or serious law violations [5];
2.  When the PC is in "hot pursuit" of offenders entering the city [6];
3.  When a PC member casually present in the city makes a citizen's arrest under Rule 113, Section 6 of the Rules of Court [7]; and
4.  When the President of the Philippines, in the exercise of his constitutional power as Commander-in-Chief, orders the PC to intervene [8].

The decision appealed from is reversed.
