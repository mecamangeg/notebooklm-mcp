I. CAPTION
ENRIQUE BALDISIMO v. HON. COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF CAPIZ and ANGEL ARBOLEDA, G.R. No. L-22261, September 29, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Enrique Baldisimo filed a case to recover land from respondent Angel Arboleda. The Court of Appeals (CA) eventually declared Baldisimo the owner of the entire property [1, 2]. However, the CA found Arboleda was a possessor in good faith regarding a fishpond he constructed, giving Baldisimo the option to either refund Arboleda's expenses or sell the land to him [3]. Upon remand, Baldisimo elected to refund the expenses [4]. The trial court fixed the reimbursement amount at P2,958.07 [5]. Baldisimo appealed this amount to the CA, arguing it was excessive, but Arboleda did not appeal [5]. Pending the appeal, Baldisimo deposited the P2,958.07 with the trial court and moved for a writ of execution to gain possession [6]. The trial court denied the motion, ruling that Arboleda had the right of retention until reimbursed and that the appeal was still pending [7]. Baldisimo filed a petition for mandamus [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may be compelled by mandamus to issue a writ of execution for possession despite the pending appeal on the reimbursement amount.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court unlawfully neglected to perform a duty resulting from its office [8]. While Article 546 of the Civil Code grants a possessor in good faith the right to retain the property until reimbursed for necessary expenses, Baldisimo had already deposited the full amount fixed by the trial court (P2,958.07) [8]. Since Arboleda did not appeal the supplemental decision, he could not recover more than that amount regardless of the outcome of Baldisimo's appeal; thus, Arboleda's rights were fully protected by the deposit [9].

The Court emphasized that the ownership and right to possession were already settled by the final CA decision and were not being litigated in the pending appeal, which was limited to the *amount* of reimbursement [10]. Under Section 9, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, the trial court retains the power to issue orders for the protection of rights not involved in the appeal [8]. To deny Baldisimo possession after sixteen years of litigation, when the reimbursement was already available to the respondent, would unjustly exclude him from the enjoyment of his rights [9].

Petition granted. The respondent court is commanded to issue a writ of execution for the delivery of possession to the petitioner [11].
