I. CAPTION
ASELA P. TACTAQUIN v. JOSE B. PALILEO, G.R. No. L-20865, December 29, 1967, 21 SCRA 1431, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Asela Tactaquin filed a civil action (Civil Case No. Q-6601) to recover damages for the death of her daughter and physical injuries resulting from Jose Palileo's reckless driving [1]. Palileo was simultaneously charged in a criminal case (Criminal Case No. 4736) [1]. During the criminal proceedings, before judgment was rendered, the private prosecutor explicitly reserved the right to file a separate civil action, which the court duly recorded [2]. Despite this reservation, the trial court convicted Palileo and included a sentence ordering him to pay P4,000.00 in damages to Tactaquin [3]. Palileo subsequently moved to dismiss the separate civil action, arguing it was barred by *res judicata* due to the final judgment in the criminal case [3]. The lower court sustained the motion and dismissed the civil case [3]. The Supreme Court initially affirmed the dismissal, prompting Tactaquin to file a Motion for Reconsideration [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the separate civil action is barred by *res judicata* despite the timely reservation of the right to file it.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court granted the Motion for Reconsideration. Under the rules, a civil action for recovery of civil liability is impliedly instituted with the criminal action unless the offended party expressly waives or reserves the right to institute it separately [5]. To be timely and effective, such reservation must be made before the rendition of judgment [5]. In this case, the reservation was made and recorded before the criminal court rendered its decision [2]. Consequently, the question of civil liability was automatically removed from the criminal case, rendering the portion of the judgment awarding civil indemnity a nullity [2]. A null judgment cannot constitute *res judicata* [2]. Furthermore, once the reservation was made, Tactaquin lost her standing to intervene in the criminal prosecution; thus, she could not have been expected to appeal the erroneous award of damages in the criminal case [6].

The Court's original decision was set aside, and the case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [7].
