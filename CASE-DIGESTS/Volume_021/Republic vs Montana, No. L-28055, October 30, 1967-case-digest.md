I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR DELFIN MONTANO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-28055, October 30, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
In 1964, the Provincial Board of Cavite passed Resolution No. 27 creating the "Cavite Department of Public Safety" (CDPS), and respondent Governor Delfin Montano issued Administrative Order No. 65-1 defining its functions. [1, 2] The CDPS was tasked with law enforcement activities, crime investigation, and civil defense, effectively operating as a police force. [3-5] Governor Montano appointed the other respondents as officers of this body. [6] The Solicitor General filed a petition for *quo warranto*, arguing that the province lacked the authority to create a public office with police functions. [6] Respondents countered that the power was implied from Section 3 of the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. 2264), which allows provinces to appropriate money for the general welfare, and Section 12, which mandates the liberal construction of implied powers of local governments. [7, 8]

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the provincial government has the implied power to create a provincial police force under the general welfare clause of the Local Autonomy Act. [9]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that provincial governments are governments of enumerated powers and can only exercise those expressly granted or necessarily implied. [10] While Section 3 of the Local Autonomy Act grants the power to appropriate funds for the general welfare, it does not imply the power to create public offices; municipal offices can only be created by legislative authority. [11, 12] Section 12 of the same Act, which commands liberal construction of implied powers, does not supply power where none exists. [13, 14]

Furthermore, the power to create a police force is denied to provinces. [15, 16] Statutes such as the Police Act of 1966 and the Revised Administrative Code expressly provide for national, city, and municipal police forces, but notably exclude provincial police forces. [12] The legislature intended to reserve this field, authorizing Governors only to call upon the Philippine Constabulary or transfer municipal police during emergencies. [17, 18] Thus, the creation of the CDPS was an unlawful exercise of power. [19]

Petition **GRANTED**. Resolution No. 27 and Administrative Order No. 65-1 are declared void, the Cavite Department of Public Safety is dissolved, and the respondents are ousted from their positions. [19]
