**I. CAPTION**
TALISAY-SILAY MILLING CO., INC. v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and ILDEFONSO ALVAREZ, G.R. No. L-22096, September 29, 1967, Castro, J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Ildefonso Alvarez was a paymaster for petitioner Talisay-Silay Milling Co., Inc. [3]. On November 23, 1953, due to an approaching typhoon, the company ordered him to cease work and go home [3]. Alvarez traveled to Bacolod City by bus, where he then boarded the petitioner’s pick-up truck to proceed to his hometown in Bago, Negros Occidental [4]. The truck met with an accident at Kilometer 17, resulting in injuries to Alvarez [4].

Alvarez filed a claim for compensation. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded him compensation, ruling that the trip was with the knowledge and consent of the petitioner, specifically granted by the superintendent of transportation, Roque Torres [5, 6]. The petitioner appealed, arguing that the injuries did not arise out of and in the course of employment because the trip was without the manager's consent and beyond the customary perimeter of travel [7]. Petitioner also admittedly failed to file its controversion on time but argued that the WCC rules should be liberally construed and that its right to controvert was reinstated when the hearing officer allowed it to present evidence [8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the injuries arose out of and in the course of employment. [9]
2. W/N the petitioner waived its right to controvert the claim. [9]

**IV. RULING**
**1. YES.** The Court affirmed the WCC's finding that the injuries arose out of and in the course of employment. [10, 11]. While the trip to Bago was beyond the customary perimeter of travel provided by the company, the extended trip was made with the acquiescence of the petitioner’s superintendent of transportation [11]. Injuries sustained by a workman while being provided with transportation by the employer are compensable "when it is with the ‘knowledge and acquiescence of the employer’" or result from an express agreement or custom [12].

**2. YES.** The petitioner waived its right to controvert the claim. [13]. By failing to file the controversion on time, the employer renounced "by operation of law" its right to question the validity of the claim [13]. This statutory renunciation is not voided simply because the hearing officer treated the case as contested, nor is it automatically reinstated by the claimant's failure to declare the employer in default [13]. Reinstatement of the right to controvert requires the submission of reasonable grounds, which the petitioner failed to provide [13].

**Judgment affirmed.** [14]
