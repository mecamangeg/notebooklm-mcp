I. CAPTION
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, UNITED STATES LINES COMPANY and/or LUZON STEVEDORING CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-27515, September 5, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On October 14, 1965, plaintiff Insurance Company of North America filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to recover P86,081.30, representing the insured value of 82 cartons of goods lost while in the custody of the defendants (carrier, lighter operator, or arrastre operator). The Bureau of Customs and the Republic of the Philippines moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of State immunity from suit. Although initially denied, the CFI eventually dismissed the case against the government defendants on February 1, 1967, citing *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Bureau of Customs*. Plaintiff appealed, arguing inter alia that the claim could not be filed with the Auditor General under *Compañia General de Tabacos v. French* because the liability of the Government was in issue and the damages were unliquidated.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs are immune from suit regarding the operation of the arrastre service.
2. W/N the money claim must be filed with the Auditor General.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Bureau of Customs, in operating the arrastre service, performs a necessary incident to the prime governmental function of taxation. As such, it is not suable for alleged losses resulting therefrom. *A fortiori*, neither is the Republic of the Philippines suable for said activity. The Court reaffirmed the doctrine laid down in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Bureau of Customs*.

2. **YES.** Under Commonwealth Act No. 327, money claims against the government must be lodged with the Auditor General. The Court distinguished the present case from *Compañia General de Tabacos v. French*. The Auditor General lacks competence only when the claim involves unliquidated damages requiring the application of judgment and discretion. However, where the claim is for a fixed and determinate amount based on shipping papers (as in this case for P86,081.30), the Auditor General has the power to act on the claim, even if the existence of the debt is in issue.

The Order of dismissal is affirmed.
