I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR HABEAS CORPUS OF MARMOLITO CATELO Y RIVERA v. CHIEF OF THE CITY JAIL, MANILA POLICE DEPARTMENT, MANILA, G.R. No. L-26703, September 5, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Marmolito Catelo was charged with murder for the killing of a Manila Deputy Sheriff. While his co-accused was earlier charged in an information filed on April 20, 1966, Catelo remained at large until his arrest on August 10, 1966, at 5:00 p.m. [1, 2]. The following day, August 11, at 9:00 a.m., the Fiscal’s Office filed an amended information including Catelo as a co-accused in the same criminal case [2]. Catelo’s counsel moved to reset the hearing on the admission of the amended information [2].

On August 15, Catelo filed a petition for habeas corpus, arguing his detention was illegal because the information was filed without a preliminary investigation, allegedly in violation of Section 38-C of the Revised Charter of Manila (R.A. No. 1201) [3]. The Court of First Instance denied the petition, ruling that the filing of the amended information constituted substantial compliance with Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code regarding the period for detention [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the filing of the information against the petitioner without a prior preliminary investigation was illegal under Section 38-C of the Revised Manila Charter.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the petitioner's contention is untenable because he was already in the legal custody of the police upon his arrest [4]. The requirement for a preliminary investigation before filing an information under the first part of Section 38-C of the Manila Charter applies only when the accused is not in custody [4, 5].

When an accused is already detained, the Fiscal is authorized to file an information without a preliminary investigation to comply with the time limits fixed by law—in this case, 18 hours under Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code [4, 6]. To obtain a preliminary investigation while under arrest, the petitioner must sign a waiver of the provisions of Article 125 [4, 5]. Since Catelo did not sign such a waiver, the Fiscal was compelled to surrender him to the court by filing the amended information within the 18-hour reglementary period [4]. The Court further noted that while the information was not immediately admitted by the lower court, the delay was caused by Catelo's own objections, and the timely filing constituted substantial compliance with the law [6].

Decision affirmed [7].
