**I. CAPTION**
ARMANDO V. AMPIL v. THE HONORABLE JUDGE CORAZON JULIANO-AGRAVA, ANTONIO M. PEREZ and BENIGNO PEREZ Y TUAZON, G.R. No. L-27394, October 13, 1967, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Armando V. Ampil filed a petition for certiorari on March 31, 1967, securing a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain the enforcement of a lower court order (Annex D) [1]. Respondent Antonio M. Perez subsequently filed a motion to lift the writ and compel Ampil to deliver Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 24927 and 24928 [1]. Perez argued that these properties were already awarded to him under a compromise agreement in a separate case (G.R. No. L-19711), which the Supreme Court had approved on November 17, 1966 [1]. Ampil, who was in possession of the titles, had a pending claim for attorney's fees against his former client, Angela Tuason de Perez [2, 3]. Despite a Court resolution requiring him to comment on Perez's motion, Ampil failed to do so [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the writ of preliminary injunction should be lifted and the certificates of title delivered to Respondent Perez.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court granted the motion to lift the injunction. The Court reasoned that the compromise agreement awarding the properties to Perez had already been approved, and Ampil failed to oppose the motion despite notice [2, 4]. However, to protect Ampil's interest regarding his claim for attorney's fees against Angela Tuason de Perez, the Court imposed a condition. Ampil is ordered to deliver the certificates of title to Antonio M. Perez only upon the filing and approval of a bond in the sum of P25,000, which shall answer for any damages Ampil might suffer in connection with his fee claim resulting from the lifting of the injunction [2, 3].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred; C.J. Concepcion and J. Bengzon, J.P. were on leave [3]).
