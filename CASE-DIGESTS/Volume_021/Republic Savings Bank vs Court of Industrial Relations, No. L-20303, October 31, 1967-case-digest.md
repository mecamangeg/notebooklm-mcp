I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC SAVINGS BANK (now REPUBLIC BANK) v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ROSENDO T. RESUELLO, et al., G.R. No. L-20303, October 31, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Republic Savings Bank filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Supreme Court's decision dated September 27, 1967, which found the Bank guilty of unfair labor practices (ULP) for discharging respondent employees [1, 2]. The Bank argued that since the original complaint only charged a violation of Section 4(a)(5) of the Industrial Peace Act, the Court denied it due process by finding it liable under Section 4(a)(1) and (6) as well [2]. The Bank claimed it was unable to present evidence that the employees’ letter—which the Bank viewed as libelous and the basis for their discharge—was not a protected concerted activity [3, 4]. The Bank also contended that it could not be guilty of refusal to bargain because the employees failed to follow the grievance procedure in the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) [5]. Finally, the Bank pleaded for the mitigation of backwages to deduct amounts the employees earned or could have earned during their dismissal [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Bank can be found guilty of unfair labor practices under provisions not specifically denominated in the complaint.
2. W/N the employees' failure to follow the grievance procedure excuses the Bank's refusal to bargain.
3. W/N the plea for deduction of backwages should be resolved by the Supreme Court in this resolution.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** It is of no consequence whether the act is denominated as restraint, interference, discriminatory discharge, or refusal to bargain [7, 8]. What matters is that the Bank’s conduct in discharging the employees constituted an unfair labor practice [8]. It is settled that violations of paragraphs (2) through (6) of Section 4(a) of the Industrial Peace Act are also violations of Section 4(a)(1), which secures the right to self-organization and concerted activities [3, 9]. The Bank was aware of the factual basis of the complaint and was afforded full opportunity to justify its actions [10].

2. **NO.** The argument is fallacious because the respondent employees belonged to different unions and were not governed by a single CBA with a specific grievance procedure [5]. Even assuming a failure to follow procedure, the Bank was not justified in unilaterally discharging them or ignoring their demand; at most, it could have ignored the demand but not committed the ULP of discharge [4].

3. **NO.** While deductions for actual or potential earnings are valid to prevent double compensation and enforce the duty to mitigate damages [6, 11], this plea must be addressed to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) when the case is remanded for execution [12, 13]. The only issue before the Supreme Court is the illegality of the dismissal; the specific amount of backwages is a matter for the lower court to determine during execution [12, 13].

Accordingly, the Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED** [13].
