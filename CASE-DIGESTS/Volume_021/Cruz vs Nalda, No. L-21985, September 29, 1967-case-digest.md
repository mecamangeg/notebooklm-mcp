I. CAPTION
AMPARO CRUZ v. ROSA HERNANDEZ NALDA, et al., G.R. No. L-21985, September 29, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Amparo Cruz leased three parcels of land in Manila from respondents (Nalda family) and Angela Butte for five years, extendible "at the option of both parties." When Cruz sought renewal, Butte agreed, but respondents refused and demanded higher rent. Upon the lease's expiration, respondents filed an unlawful detainer case. The Municipal Court dismissed the complaint, but the Court of First Instance (CFI) reversed this on appeal, ordering Cruz to vacate and pay damages. Both parties appealed the CFI decision to the Court of Appeals (CA). Pending perfection of the appeal, the CFI granted respondents' motion for execution. Cruz filed a petition for certiorari with the CA to stop the execution. The CA dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, reasoning that the main appeal involved only questions of law—specifically the interpretation of the lease renewal clause—which falls under the Supreme Court's exclusive jurisdiction.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over the petition for certiorari.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the CA has jurisdiction because the main appeal involved questions of fact. Specifically, the determination of whether the petitioner acted in bad faith regarding the lease renewal is a question of fact, or at least a mixed question of fact and law [1]. Furthermore, the reasonableness of the amounts awarded for the use and occupation of the premises and attorney's fees is a question of fact [1]. Since the appeal involves factual questions, it falls within the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals. Consequently, the certiorari proceeding challenging the execution order was correctly filed "in aid of" the CA's appellate jurisdiction [2, 3]. The CA decision was set aside and the record remanded for further proceedings [3].
