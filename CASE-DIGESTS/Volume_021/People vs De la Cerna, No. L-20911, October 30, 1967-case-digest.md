**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SULPICIO DE LA CERNA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20911, October 30, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 3, 1958, in Tupi, Cotabato, Rafael Cabizares and his son, Casiano, were killed [1]. Prior to the incident, Rafael had won an ejectment suit involving a land dispute against the father of accused Sulpicio de la Cerna [2, 3]. Motivated by resentment, the accused held a meeting on February 2, 1958, conspiring to kill Rafael [4].

The following morning, as Rafael and his family passed near Sulpicio’s house, Sulpicio shot and wounded Rafael [5]. Rafael was brought to his father Demetrio’s house nearby [5]. Sulpicio and his co-accused pursued them, surrounded Demetrio’s house, stoned it, and thrust bolos through the walls [6]. Inside, co-accused Serapio Maquiling shot Rafael again [7]. When Casiano jumped out of the house to escape, Serapio pursued and shot him dead [7]. Sulpicio then fired a third and final shot at Rafael, killing him [7].

The Court of First Instance convicted Sulpicio and Serapio as principals for the double murder. It convicted appellants Godofredo Rotor, Antonio Bautista, Severino Matchoca, and Teodoro Libumfacil only as accomplices for Rafael’s murder [8]. Sulpicio claimed self-defense, while the others raised alibis [9, 10]. They also questioned the procedural regularity of the Fiscal indicting all accused after the Municipal Court had dismissed charges against some of them during the preliminary investigation [11].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the defect in the preliminary investigation was waived by the appellants.
2. W/N Sulpicio acted in self-defense.
3. W/N Sulpicio is criminally liable for the murder of Casiano.
4. W/N appellants Rotor, Bautista, Matchoca, and Libumfacil are liable as principals for the murder of Rafael.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The appellants waived the procedural defect. The objection regarding the Fiscal’s conduct of the preliminary investigation was raised only after the prosecution had rested its case. Under the Rules of Court, failure to raise such irregularity before entering a plea constitutes a waiver [11].

2. **NO.** The physical evidence contradicts the claim of self-defense. Sulpicio claimed he shot the victims frontally from his elevated house while they were attacking him [12]. However, autopsy reports showed both victims sustained gunshot wounds directly at the back [12]. Furthermore, the trajectory of the bullet in Casiano’s body was upwards, which is inconsistent with a shot fired downwards from an elevated floor [12].

3. **NO.** Sulpicio is not liable for Casiano's death. The rule is that conspirators are liable only for acts done pursuant to the conspiracy [13, 14]. The established conspiracy was solely to kill Rafael; nothing was agreed upon regarding his family members [14]. The killing of Casiano by Serapio was an act outside the contemplation of the conspirators and was not a necessary consequence of the intended crime [14]. Since there was no evidence Sulpicio abetted this specific act, only the actual perpetrator (Serapio) is liable [15].

4. **YES.** They are guilty as principals. The Court found they were not merely accomplices but co-conspirators. Rotor, Bautista, and Matchoca were present at the planning meeting or actively participated in the execution by providing ammunition, shouting threats, and besieging the house where the victim took refuge [16, 17]. Libumfacil was armed, fired at Rafael, and participated in stoning the house [18]. Their acts showed a unity of purpose and determination to end Rafael’s life, making them principals by direct or indirect conspiracy [18, 19].

**Disposition:** Judgment modified. Sulpicio de la Cerna is **ACQUITTED** for the murder of Casiano but found **GUILTY** as principal for the murder of Rafael. Appellants Rotor, Bautista, Matchoca, and Libumfacil are found **GUILTY** as principals (not accomplices) for the murder of Rafael. All are sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* [20].
