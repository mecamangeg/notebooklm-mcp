**I. CAPTION**
THE PHILIPPINE POSTAL SAVINGS BANK and FRANCISCO V. LOPEZ v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and PHILIPPINE COMMUNICATIONS, ELECTRONICS & ELECTRICITY WORKERS FEDERATION (PCWF), G.R. No. L-24572, December 20, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
On August 24, 1964, respondent Philippine Communications, Electronics and Electricity Workers Federation (PCWF) filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to be certified as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees of the Philippine Postal Savings Bank [1]. The Bank moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that the CIR lacked jurisdiction because the Bank is a mere division of the Bureau of Posts performing governmental functions, and thus its employees are prohibited from striking or collective bargaining under the Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act No. 875) [1].

The CIR denied the motion to dismiss and the subsequent motion for reconsideration, ruling that the case should proceed [1]. The Bank and its Superintendent, Francisco V. Lopez, filed a petition for review by certiorari before the Supreme Court [2]. During the pendency of the case, the President certified the dispute to the CIR, and the petitioners subsequently invoked the CIR's authority to order the union to return to work, resulting in an agreement on salary increases [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the employees of the Philippine Postal Savings Bank perform proprietary functions and are entitled to the benefits of the Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act No. 875).

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court held that the Philippine Postal Savings Bank performs proprietary functions [4]. Although the Bank is a division of the Bureau of Posts, it operates separately, keeps distinct books of account, and refunds operational expenses advanced by the Bureau out of its own earnings and reserve funds [5]. These earnings do not accrue to the general fund but remain with the Bank for investment and its own benefit [5]. Citing *Government of the Philippine Islands v. China Banking Corporation*, the Court noted that the Bank has a personality of its own and its funds are not Insular Government funds [5, 6].

Under Section 11 of Republic Act No. 875, the prohibition against strikes applies only to employees engaged in governmental functions, not those in proprietary functions [7]. The right to enjoy the benefits of the Act depends on the nature of the work, not merely whether the office is an integral part of the government [4]. Since the Bank's employees are engaged in proprietary functions, they may join labor organizations and bargain collectively [8, 9]. Furthermore, petitioners were estopped from challenging the CIR's jurisdiction after invoking its authority to resolve the strike during the proceedings [3].

The Order and Resolution appealed from are **AFFIRMED** [10].
