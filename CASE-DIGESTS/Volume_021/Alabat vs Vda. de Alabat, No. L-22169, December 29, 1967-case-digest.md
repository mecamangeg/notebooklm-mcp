I. CAPTION
SERGIO ALABAT, PETRONILO ALABAT, NICOLAS ALABAT and FORTUNATO ALABAT v. TORIBIA TANDOG VDA. DE ALABAT, LEONCIO ALABAT, JARMILO ALABAT, and PREMIA ALABAT; WENIFREDA ALMEDA, Intervenor, G.R. No. L-22169, December 29, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, children of the late Escolastico Alabat by his first marriage, filed an action for partition of unregistered lands and a bank deposit against Respondents, Escolastico’s widow and children by his second marriage [1]. Respondents alleged the properties originated from US Veterans Administration death benefits paid for the death of Leonardo Alabat, a son of the second marriage who died as a soldier in World War II [1]. Respondents claimed the only heirs were Leonardo's mother (Toribia) and his natural daughter (Intervenor Wenifreda Alabat) [1]. The trial court ruled in favor of Respondents, excluding Petitioners, holding that Wenifreda was a recognized natural child due to her "enjoyment of status" and applying Article 991 of the New Civil Code [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the death benefits paid by the US Veterans Administration form part of the deceased soldier's estate.
2. W/N the intervenor is entitled to inherit as a natural child based solely on her enjoyment of such status.
3. W/N the Petitioners are entitled to participate in the partition of the properties.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The death benefits were paid to the soldier's parents as indemnity or insurance for his death; the soldier himself was never entitled to it as he died before the payment accrued [3]. Consequently, the money forms part of the community property of the parents, Escolastico and Toribia [3]. As community property, Escolastico was entitled to one-half, which now forms his estate [3].

2. **NO.** Under the Civil Code of 1889 (applicable as Leonardo died in 1945), rights of a natural child spring from acknowledgment, not merely from filiation or the enjoyment of status [4]. Possession of status is *per se* not a sufficient operative acknowledgment but only a ground to compel the parent to acknowledge the child [4]. There was no evidence Wenifreda was voluntarily or compulsorily acknowledged [5].

3. **YES.** Since the properties belong to the estate of Escolastico Alabat (specifically his half of the community property), and not the estate of Leonardo, all of Escolastico's surviving children from both marriages are entitled to share in the inheritance [3, 6]. The widow is also entitled to a share equal to that of each child under Article 996 of the New Civil Code [7].

The decision is **REVERSED** and **SET ASIDE**, and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings, including the opportunity for the intervenor to establish her rights to acknowledgment [6, 8].
