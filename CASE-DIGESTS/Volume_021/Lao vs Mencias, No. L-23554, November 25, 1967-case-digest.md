I. CAPTION
HONORIA LAO and PRIMITIVO LAO v. HON. JUDGE EULOGIO MENCIAS, LINO VICTORINO, et al., G.R. No. L-23554, November 25, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Honoria and Primitivo Lao were defendants in a complaint for rescission of contract and damages filed by private respondents (Lino Victorino, et al.) in the Court of First Instance of Rizal. Respondent Judge Eulogio Mencias rendered a decision in favor of the plaintiffs [1, 2]. Before the decision became final and while the petitioners' appeal was pending, the plaintiffs filed a motion for the issuance of a writ of execution [2]. The motion alleged that the petitioners were dissipating the monthly installments received from the subdivision lots in question, had not constructed required improvements, and had no other assets to satisfy the judgment, making execution necessary to prevent the judgment from becoming ineffectual [3]. The Judge granted the motion [4]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that the Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion because the motion for execution was "unverified" (not sworn to) and no affidavit was attached to substantiate the factual allegations of insolvency and asset dissipation [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a motion for execution pending appeal must be verified (sworn to) to be valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that there is no requirement under the Rules of Court that a motion for the issuance of a writ of execution must be verified [7, 8].

Under Section 2, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, the court may order execution to issue before the expiration of the time to appeal provided three requisites are met: (a) there must be a motion by the prevailing party with notice to the adverse party; (b) there must be good reasons for issuing execution; and (c) these good reasons must be stated in a special order [8]. The Court found that all requisites were present. The insolvency of the defeated party, or the exhaustion of their assets, constitutes a "good reason" for execution pending appeal, as affirmed in *Astraquillo v. Javier* [9]. Since the motion was sufficient in form and substance despite the lack of verification, the petition was **DENIED** [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Dizon, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, and Angeles concurred. Chief Justice Concepcion and Justice J.B.L. Reyes were on official leave [10].
