I. CAPTION
FORTUNATO MAGTAOS, JR., ET AL. v. HON. CECILIA MUNOZ-PALMA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-28239, November 10, 1967, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Magtaos, et al. filed Election Cases Nos. 39 to 55 in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, presided by respondent Judge Munoz-Palma, seeking the exclusion of certain names from the List of Voters in Cainta, Rizal. Attempts to personally serve copies of the petitions upon the respondent voters proved futile as they could not be found or were unknown at their given addresses. Service by registered mail also failed because the respondents were either fictitious or non-residents. Consequently, notices of the hearing were posted at the Cainta Municipal Building, Bining’s Barber Shop, and Garcia’s Sari-Sari Store. A motion to dismiss was filed in the lower court which hypothetically admitted these allegations. Petitioners filed an original action for mandamus with the Supreme Court to compel the respondent Judge to proceed with the cases [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge may be compelled by mandamus to hear and decide the exclusion cases despite the lack of personal service or service by mail on the respondent voters.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the demands of due process were satisfied as to the respondent voters. Since personal service was futile and service by registered mail could not be effected (as the respondents were fictitious or non-residents), the alternative mode of notice employed was sufficient. The Court found that notice was properly given by posting copies of the notice of hearing in three public places (municipal building, barber shop, and sari-sari store) in accordance with Sec. 1, R.A. 5178 in conjunction with par. (b), Sec. 123 of the Revised Election Code [1].

The petition for mandamus was granted, the preliminary mandatory injunction previously issued was declared permanent, and the respondent Judge was directed to hear and promptly decide Election Cases Nos. 39 to 55 [1, 2].
