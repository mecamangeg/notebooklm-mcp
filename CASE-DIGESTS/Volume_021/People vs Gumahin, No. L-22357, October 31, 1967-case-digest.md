I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FELIPE GUMAHIN, G.R. No. L-22357, October 31, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On April 23, 1960, during a dance in Salay, Misamis Oriental, appellant municipal policeman Felipe Gumahin and another officer confronted Abraham Salarda, suspecting he was armed. After finding no weapon, Gumahin ordered Salarda to undress in public. Antonio Galamiton, the PTA president, intervened and requested that the search be continued privately at the municipal building. Incensed by the interference, Gumahin struck Galamiton with his revolver. As Galamiton tried to walk away, Gumahin pursued him, struck him again, shot him in the shoulder, and finally, while Galamiton was on the ground trying to rise, pressed the revolver to his chest and shot him dead.

The Court of First Instance of Misamis Oriental convicted Gumahin of murder qualified by treachery, attended by the aggravating circumstances of impunity and abuse of official position, and sentenced him to death. Gumahin appealed, alleging irregularity in the preliminary investigation and claiming the shooting was accidental during a struggle for the gun.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to conduct the first stage of preliminary investigation before arrest warrants a reversal of the conviction.
2. W/N the appellant is guilty of murder based on the credibility of prosecution witnesses.
3. W/N the aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation, impunity, and abuse of official position were present.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The alleged irregularity, consisting of the failure to conduct the first stage of the preliminary investigation before arrest, merits no further consideration because the trial was fairly conducted and the rights of the accused were protected [1].

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the trial court's reliance on prosecution witnesses, citing the rule that appellate courts desist from disturbing trial court findings on credibility unless patent inconsistencies exist or conclusions are unsupported by evidence [2], [3]. The physical evidence contradicted the defense's theory of accidental shooting during a grapple: the downward trajectory of the fatal wound was consistent with the victim being in a squatting position, and the absence of blood on the appellant's uniform was inconsistent with his claim that the victim was on top of him when the heart was pierced [4], [5], [6].

3. **NO.** While the Court affirmed that murder qualified by treachery was committed, it ruled that the aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation, impunity, and abuse of official position were not duly proved [7].

The judgment is **MODIFIED**. The appellant is sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* and ordered to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P6,000.00 [7].
