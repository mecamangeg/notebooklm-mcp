**I. CAPTION**
AMERICAN INSURANCE COMPANY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-25478, October 23, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
In May 1963, the Bureau of Customs received a cargo of oven heaters consigned to San Miguel Corporation but failed to deliver one carton worth P690.30 [1]. American Insurance Company, as the insurer, paid the consignee the value of the lost goods [1]. On October 6, 1964, the insurance company filed a complaint for the recovery of the sum against the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs in the City Court of Manila [1]. The defendants alleged immunity from suit [1].

The City Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, ordering the defendants to pay P690.00 [2]. The defendants appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) [2]. During the scheduled pre-trial on October 27, 1965, only the plaintiff's counsel appeared, but he could not present authority to compromise [2]. Consequently, the CFI dismissed the complaint for failure of the plaintiff to appear [2]. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court, assailing the order of dismissal as erroneous under the Rules of Court [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs are immune from suit regarding the operation of the arrastre service.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the procedural issue regarding the declaration of non-suit was moot and academic [3]. The Court applied the doctrine laid down in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service and Bureau of Customs* (L-23139, December 17, 1966), which held that the Bureau of Customs, as part of the governmental machinery, operates the arrastre service as an incident of the prime governmental function of taxation [3]. As such, it is immune from suit, and this immunity extends to the Republic of the Philippines regarding said operation [3].

The appealed order of dismissal is hereby affirmed [4].
