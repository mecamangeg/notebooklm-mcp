I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE EDUCATION CO., INC., v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-23716, September 20, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Philippine Education Co., Inc. (PECI) imported a shipment of books, magazines, and other goods on board the "S/S Pioneer Ming," which arrived in Manila on April 25, 1960. Three days later, on April 28, 1960, PECI filed a provisional claim with the Manila Port Service (MPS) and the carrier for goods "shortlanded and/or landed in bad order ex-abovementioned vessel." No other claim was filed within the 15-day period required by Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract.

The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of PECI, ordering MPS to pay P2,403.21 plus interest and attorney's fees. MPS appealed, arguing that the provisional claim was insufficient because its phrasing ("ex-abovementioned vessel") referred to carrier liability rather than arrastre liability, thereby failing to meet the requirements of the Management Contract [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the provisional claim filed by the plaintiff complied with the requirements of Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract despite stating the goods were damaged "ex-vessel."

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the provisional claim did not satisfy the requirements of Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract. Although the claim was filed within the prescribed 15-day period, the specific language used—"shortlanded and/or landed in bad order *ex-abovementioned vessel*"—indicated that the loss or damage occurred on board the carrying vessel before the goods were delivered to the arrastre operator [3].

The Court reasoned that by implying the liability rested with the carrier (the vessel owners) and not the arrastre operator, the claim effectively deprived MPS of a "reasonable opportunity to check" the truth of the claim insofar as it was relevant to their own liability. Since the claim intimated that it was unnecessary for MPS to investigate, it failed to strictly comply with the Management Contract [4, 5]. Citing *The American Insurance Co. v. Manila Port Service*, the Court concluded the claim was insufficient.

The decision appealed from is REVERSED, and the complaint is DISMISSED [5].
