I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. GREGORIO D. MONTEJO and FELIX WEE SIT, G.R. No. L-24154, October 31, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
The City Fiscal of Zamboanga City filed Criminal Case No. 3225 against respondent Felix Wee Sit for double homicide and serious physical injuries through reckless imprudence [1]. The prosecution subpoenaed Ernesto Uaje, a material witness and police officer residing in Montalban, Rizal, to testify at the trial in Zamboanga City [2]. Although Uaje received the subpoena in Rizal, he failed to appear [2]. The City Fiscal moved for an order of arrest or to cite Uaje for contempt [2]. Respondent Judge Montejo denied the motion, relying on Section 9, Rule 23 of the Rules of Court, which provides that a witness is not bound to attend before any court outside the province in which he resides unless the distance is less than 50 kilometers [2, 3]. The City Fiscal filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus, arguing the Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Section 9, Rule 23 of the Rules of Court (limiting the compulsion of witnesses residing more than 50km away) applies to criminal cases.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that Section 9, Rule 23 of the Rules of Court applies solely to civil cases and not to criminal cases [4, 5]. To rule otherwise would restrict the inherent power of the Court to compel the attendance of persons to testify in a case pending therein, as provided in Section 5, Rule 135 [5]. Furthermore, Section 6, Rule 119 specifically authorizes the court in criminal cases to require a material witness to give bail or be committed to prison to ensure their appearance, demonstrating the court's broader authority in criminal proceedings [5]. Thus, the respondent Judge's refusal to enforce the witness's attendance based on the 50-kilometer rule constituted grave abuse of discretion [4, 6].

The preliminary injunction was lifted, the challenged orders were set aside, and the respondent Judge was ordered to pass upon the motion without consideration of Section 9, Rule 23 [6].
