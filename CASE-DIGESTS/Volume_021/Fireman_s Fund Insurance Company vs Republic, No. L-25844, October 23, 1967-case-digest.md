I. CAPTION
FIREMAN’S FUND INSURANCE COMPANY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and/or BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-25844, October 23, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company (Fireman's Fund) insured a shipment of 156 packages of electric transformers and parts consigned to General Electric Company, Philippines. The shipment arrived in Manila on April 30, 1963, and was turned over to the Bureau of Customs. However, the Bureau only delivered 150 packages, resulting in a shortage of six packages worth P3,630.97 [1]. After the Bureau failed to pay the claim, Fireman's Fund paid the consignee and, as subrogee, filed a complaint for recovery of the sum in the City Court of Manila against the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs [2].

The City Court ruled in favor of Fireman's Fund. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Manila affirmed the decision, rejecting the defendants' defense of state immunity [2]. The Republic appealed to the Supreme Court, asserting immunity from suit and failure to comply with the procedure for money claims under Act 3083 and Commonwealth Act No. 327 [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs are immune from suit regarding arrastre services.
2. W/N the money claim should have been filed with the Auditor General.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Republic and the Bureau of Customs are immune from suit. The Court applied the doctrine in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service*, ruling that the Bureau of Customs and the Customs Arrastre Service are parts of the governmental machinery performing a service incidental to a prime governmental function. Consequently, they may not be sued [3].

2. **YES.** The claim should have been filed with the Auditor General. Under Act 3083, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 327, money claims against the government must be filed with the Auditor General. The Court held that the claim was for a fixed amount easily verifiable by papers and invoices, making it a liquidated claim within the jurisdiction of the Auditor General, regardless of the government's denial of liability [4].

The decision appealed from is REVERSED and the complaint is DISMISSED [5].
