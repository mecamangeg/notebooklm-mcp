I. CAPTION
LOURDES VDA. DE MAGALONA v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and THE NATIONAL SHIPYARD AND STEEL CORPORATION (NASSCO), G.R. No. L-21849, December 11, 1967, 129 Phil. 104, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Jorge Magalona, an employee of NASSCO exposed to chemicals and heat, went on sick leave in February 1956 and died of duodenal ulcer in May 1956 [1, 2]. His widow, petitioner Lourdes, filed a compensation claim which NASSCO failed to controvert [2]. The Hearing Officer awarded death benefits, ruling the work conditions likely caused the illness [2]. NASSCO appealed, and the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed the award, relying on a medical officer's opinion—admitted without giving Lourdes a chance to object—that the ulcer was not work-connected [3]. The WCC ruled that the claimant failed to prove a causal link between the illness and the nature of work [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N NASSCO is barred from challenging the claim due to its failure to controvert.
2. W/N the medical report admitted without the adverse party's opportunity to object is valid evidence.
3. W/N the claimant bears the burden of proving the causal connection between the illness and employment.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** By failing to present a written controversion of the claim, NASSCO renounced its right to challenge it, barring all non-jurisdictional defenses such as non-compensability of the illness and prescription [4]. To reinstate the right to controvert, the law requires a petition under oath specifying the reasons for the failure, which NASSCO did not file [5].

2. **NO.** While the Commission is not bound by technical rules of procedure, it cannot take into account evidence where the adverse party was not given the opportunity to object to its admissibility [6]. The admission of the medical report violated Rule 22, Sec. 3 of the WCC Rules [6].

3. **NO.** It is unquestionable that once an illness supervenes at the time of employment, there is a rebuttable presumption that such illness arose out of or was aggravated by said employment [7]. The burden to overthrow this presumption and disconnect the sickness from the employment by substantial evidence rests on the employer, not the claimant [7].

The WCC decision is **REVERSED**, and the Hearing Officer's award is **AFFIRMED** [8].
