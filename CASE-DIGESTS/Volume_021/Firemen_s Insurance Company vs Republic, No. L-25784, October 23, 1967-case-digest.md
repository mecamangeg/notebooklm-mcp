I. CAPTION
FIREMEN’S INSURANCE COMPANY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, and CUSTOMS ARRASTRE SERVICE, G.R. No. L-25784, October 23, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
A shipment of 97 cartons of yarn arrived from New York and was discharged into the custody of the Bureau of Customs, which was operating the Customs Arrastre Service. Only 76 cartons were delivered to the consignee, resulting in a loss of 21 cartons valued at P11,700.04. Firemen’s Insurance Company, as the insurer, paid the loss and, as subrogee, filed a suit in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the Republic of the Philippines, the Bureau of Customs, and the Customs Arrastre Service for recovery of the amount [1].

The defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that the Republic cannot be sued without its consent, its agencies lack juridical personality, and the money claim should have been filed with the Auditor General under Act 3083 and Commonwealth Act 327 [2]. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and the petitioner appealed [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Republic and its agencies (Bureau of Customs and Customs Arrastre Service) can be sued for loss of cargo arising from arrastre operations.
2. W/N the claim for the value of the lost cargo must be filed with the Auditor General.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Bureau of Customs and the Customs Arrastre Service are mere agencies of the Republic through which it performs the prime governmental function of taxation [3]. The Court ruled that the arrastre service is a necessary incident to this function. Even if the service is deemed proprietary in nature, it does not subject the defendants to suit, as doing so would hamper the performance of a prime governmental function. Consequently, the Republic and its agencies cannot be sued for these operations without their consent [3, 4].

2. **YES.** The Court held that the claim should have been filed with the Office of the Auditor General in accordance with Act 3083, as amended by Commonwealth Act 327 [4]. The claim involves a fixed amount based on papers and documents within the reach of accounting officers, distinguishing it from unliquidated claims which are outside the Auditor General's jurisdiction [4].

The order of dismissal is AFFIRMED [5].
