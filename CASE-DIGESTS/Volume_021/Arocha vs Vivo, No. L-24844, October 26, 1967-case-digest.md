I. CAPTION
MACARIO AROCHA, in behalf of PEDRO GATCHALIAN v. MARTINIANO VIVO, Acting Commissioner of Immigration, et al. / MARTINIANO VIVO v. HON. FRANCISCO ARCA, et al., G.R. Nos. L-24844 & L-24853, October 26, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Pedro Gatchalian arrived in the Philippines in 1961 seeking admission as a Filipino citizen. The Board of Special Inquiry (BSI) admitted him on July 6, 1961. The decision was forwarded to the Board of Commissioners (BOC), where members acted individually on different dates, marking "noted" on the records. On January 24, 1962, the Secretary of Justice issued Memorandum Order No. 9, setting aside all decisions where the BOC failed to meet collectively.

Subsequently, the BOC reviewed Gatchalian's case *motu proprio*, reversed the BSI decision, and ordered his exclusion for improper documentation. The BOC decision bore the date "July 6, 1962," exactly one year from the BSI decision (the statutory deadline for review), but the number "6" was superimposed over an erased "20." Arocha filed a petition for habeas corpus. The Court of First Instance (CFI) granted the writ, ruling that the BOC decision was antedated and void because it was actually rendered on July 20, 1962—beyond the one-year prescriptive period—rendering the BSI admission final. The CFI ordered Gatchalian's release despite the Commissioner's appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Board of Commissioners' decision to exclude was rendered within the one-year prescriptive period.
2. W/N the individual "noted" actions by Commissioners constituted a valid affirmation of the BSI decision.
3. W/N the applicant was entitled to a hearing during the *motu proprio* review by the Board of Commissioners.
4. W/N the lower court erred in ordering the release of the detainee pending the government's appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the decision was rendered within the prescriptive period. The erasure and superimposition of "6" over "20" was a correction of a clerical error. The official minutes of the Board showed that the resolution to exclude was actually discussed and voted upon on July 6, 1962. The operative date of the Commissioners' action is when the resolution is adopted, and the written decision *in extenso* relates back to that date. Mere retyping of dates does not overcome the presumption of regularity in official conduct without clear proof of falsification [1], [2], [3].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the prior individual actions of the Commissioners did not constitute valid Board action. A duty entrusted to a Board must be exercised by members convened in session to deliberate collectively. Individual action renders the purpose of a Board—exchange of views—nugatory. Consequently, the Secretary of Justice validly set aside the "noted" decisions via Memorandum Order No. 9 [4], [5], [6], [7].

3. **NO.** Under Section 27(c) of Commonwealth Act No. 613, the right to be represented by counsel and be heard arises only when the alien appeals an adverse BSI decision. It does not apply to a *motu proprio* review by the BOC, where the Board merely passes upon the sufficiency of evidence already presented. The alien, having been heard by the BSI, is not entitled to a further hearing in the review unless the law expressly provides otherwise [8], [9], [10].

4. **YES.** The CFI violated Section 15, Rule 102 of the Revised Rules of Court, which prohibits the discharge of a prisoner if the officer detaining them desires to appeal. The order of release was in patent excess of jurisdiction [8], [11], [12].

Accordingly, the decision and order of the Court of First Instance are **REVERSED** and set aside.
