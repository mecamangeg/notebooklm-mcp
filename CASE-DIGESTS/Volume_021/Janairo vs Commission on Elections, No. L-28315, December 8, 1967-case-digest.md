I. CAPTION
AMBROSIO JANAIRO and FRANCISCO MADARCOS v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, ROMULO LUMAWIG, and SIMPLICIO EGINA, G.R. No. L-28315, December 8, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
During the November 14, 1967 local elections in Caluya, Antique, petitioners Janairo and Madarcos ran for Mayor and Vice-Mayor against respondents Lumawig and Egina. In Precinct No. 10 located in Sibay Island, no election was held because the persons delivering the list of registered voters were fired upon and arrived late; consequently, the board of election inspectors refused to hold the election at 6:30 PM. The respondents held a lead of 23 votes over the petitioners in the other precincts, but Precinct No. 10 had 173 registered voters, which was sufficient to alter the results.

The COMELEC suspended the canvass to allow the parties to seek judicial remedy. Petitioners filed a petition for mandamus before the Supreme Court, praying that the Court direct the COMELEC to order the continuation of the election in Precinct No. 10, or alternatively, to recommend to the President the holding of a special election.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Commission on Elections has the authority to order the holding of a new election in a precinct where the election failed to take place on the date fixed by law.
2. W/N the Supreme Court may recommend to the President the calling of a special election.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that neither the Commission on Elections nor the courts have the authority to order the holding of a special election. Under Sections 8 and 21(c) of the Revised Election Code, the authority to postpone an election or call a special election where one has failed to take place resides solely with the President. Citing *Ututalum vs. Commission on Elections*, the Court emphasized that the power to fix the date of elections is legislative in character. Consequently, no elections may be held on any date other than that fixed by law, except when provided by an Act of Congress or upon orders of a body to whom Congress has delegated such power.

2. **NO.** The Court denied the prayer to recommend a special election to the President, stating that the function of the Supreme Court is to adjudicate justiciable cases, not to make recommendations concerning the powers and functions of other government departments. Furthermore, the Court noted it was doubtful if the failure of an election in only one out of eleven precincts constituted a failure of the election for a local office under Section 21(c) of the Revised Election Code.

The petition was **DISMISSED**.
