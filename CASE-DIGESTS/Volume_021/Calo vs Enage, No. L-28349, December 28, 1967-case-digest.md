**I. CAPTION**
CONSUELO V. CALO, et al. v. HON. MANUEL L. ENAGE, et al., G.R. No. L-28349, December 28, 1967, Castro, J.

**II. FACTS**
Following the November 14, 1967 elections in Agusan, private respondents (Aquino, et al.), candidates for Governor, Vice-Governor, and board members, petitioned the Court of First Instance of Agusan for a judicial recount. They alleged that the copies of election returns marked "COPY FOR THE NACIONALISTA PARTY" showed a higher number of votes in their favor compared to the copies submitted to the Provincial Treasurer. Respondent Judge Enage issued an order on December 1, 1967, directing a judicial recount and restraining the Provincial Board of Canvassers from canvassing the returns [1, 2].

Petitioners (Calo, et al.), opposing candidates for the same positions, filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus with the Supreme Court. They argued that the respondent Judge acted in excess of jurisdiction because a discrepancy involving a political party's copy of the returns is not a valid ground for a judicial recount under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code [3]. The Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order allowing the canvass to proceed but enjoining the recount [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a judicial recount under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code may be ordered based on a discrepancy between the election return copy in the hands of the Provincial Treasurer and the copy furnished to a political party.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that the discrepancy justifying a judicial recount under Section 163 must appear among the different copies of election returns required to be accomplished by Section 150 of the Revised Election Code (i.e., copies for the ballot box, municipal treasurer, provincial treasurer, and Commission on Elections).

Citing *Acuña v. Golez*, the Court ruled that Section 163 must be construed restrictively to prevent delays in the proclamation of winning candidates [5]. Copies furnished to political parties are merely additional copies required by a COMELEC resolution and not by the Code itself; thus, they cannot serve as a legal basis for comparison for a judicial recount [6, 7]. Relying on such copies would open the door to tampering and artificial discrepancies designed to delay proclamations [7].

Accordingly, the order of the respondent Judge was **SET ASIDE**, and the Provincial Board of Canvassers was directed to proceed with the proclamation of the winning candidates [8].
