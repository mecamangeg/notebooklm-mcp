I. CAPTION
DOMINGO PO CHU SAM v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20812, September 22, 1967, Sanchez, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Domingo Po Chu Sam filed a petition for naturalization, averring an annual income of approximately P2,400.00 [2]. His 1961 income tax return, however, showed a total income of P2,514.74, which consisted of P1,514.74 in salary and P1,000.00 in bonus [2]. The petitioner was married and had no children at the time of the petition [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental rendered a decision admitting him to Philippine citizenship [1, 2]. The Republic of the Philippines appealed the decision to the Supreme Court [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner meets the requirement of having a lucrative occupation. [2, 3]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner failed to prove he had a lucrative occupation. The Court ruled that bonuses are "contingent and speculative" and therefore must not be reckoned in determining an applicant's income [2, 3]. Excluding the bonus, the petitioner's fixed annual income was only P1,514.74 [2]. Relying on *Yu Kian Chie vs. Republic* and *Co vs. Republic*, the Court determined that this amount is insufficient to meet the lucrative occupation requirement under Section 2 of the Naturalization Law for a married man, even one without children [2].

Accordingly, the judgment was reversed, and the petition for naturalization was denied. [4]
