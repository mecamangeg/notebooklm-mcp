I. CAPTION
FULTON INSURANCE COMPANY v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY AND MANILA PORT SERVICE, G.R. No. L-24263, November 18, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Fulton Insurance Company (plaintiff) was the insurer of 51 cartons of goods shipped by Vamco Intercontinental, Ltd. to Marsman & Company in Manila. The goods arrived on August 25, 1961, and were turned over to the arrastre operators, Manila Railroad Company and Manila Port Service (defendants). Only 27 cartons were delivered; 17 remained unaccounted for. Fulton paid the consignee and, as subrogee, filed Case No. 51017 in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila on July 23, 1962, suing the carrier and arrastre operators in the alternative. The CFI dismissed this first case on January 31, 1963, for lack of jurisdiction, ruling the amount (P4,701.20) was below its threshold. The dismissal became final on March 12, 1963.

Fulton filed a second complaint (Case No. 53457) on March 20, 1963. Defendants argued the claim was barred by the one-year prescriptive period in the Management Contract. The CFI rendered a decision on September 30, 1964, ordering defendants to pay P500.00. Fulton filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) on October 12, 1964, seeking the full amount, but failed to include a notice of hearing. A "supplement" setting the hearing was filed only on November 11, 1964. The CFI subsequently amended its decision on December 1, 1964, awarding the full P4,701.20. Defendants appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CFI has jurisdiction over alternative causes of action against an arrastre operator and a steamship company even if the amount claimed against the arrastre operator is within the jurisdiction of a lower court.
2. W/N the second action was barred by prescription.
3. W/N the trial court had jurisdiction to amend its decision based on a Motion for Reconsideration that lacked a notice of hearing.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A consignee uncertain of the place of loss may seek relief alternatively against the arrastre operator (deposit) and the steamship company (carriage). This action calls for the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction, which falls under the original exclusive jurisdiction of the CFI [1]. This jurisdiction is not lost even if one of the causes of action involves an amount falling within the jurisdiction of a lower court [2].

2. **NO.** Under Article 1155 of the Civil Code, the filing of an action in court interrupts the prescriptive period [3]. The interruption lasted from the filing of the first case until the order of dismissal became final. Deducting the time elapsed before the first suit and the time during the interruption, the second case was filed within the remaining balance of the one-year prescriptive period [4].

3. **NO.** Section 2 of Rule 37, in relation to Rule 15 of the Rules of Court, requires that a written notice of a motion for new trial or reconsideration be served on the adverse party stating the time and place of hearing [5]. This notice is mandatory; without it, the motion is a "useless piece of paper" that does not toll the running of the period for appeal [6]. The subsequent filing of a "supplement" to set the hearing did not cure the defect retroactively [7]. Since the decision of September 30, 1964, had already become final by the time the hearing was set, the court lost jurisdiction to amend it [8].

ACCORDINGLY, the order of December 1, 1964, is SET ASIDE, and the decision of September 30, 1964, is AFFIRMED [9].
