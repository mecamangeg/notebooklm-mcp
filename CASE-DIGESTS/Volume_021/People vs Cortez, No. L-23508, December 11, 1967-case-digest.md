I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. NELLY P. CORTEZ, G.R. No. L-23508, December 11, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On January 16, 1964, Julita Santos filed a complaint for grave slander against Nelly P. Cortez in the Court of First Instance of Manila for uttering serious and insulting words [1]. During the arraignment on January 30, 1964, Cortez pleaded not guilty [2]. However, the trial court's decision dated March 3, 1964 stated that she had pleaded guilty, and consequently convicted her [3]. Cortez appealed, contending that she never pleaded guilty and that page 15 of the trial records, which supposedly contained the stenographic notes of the March 3 proceedings, was missing [4]. She sought a remand for trial [4]. However, records showed Cortez previously admitted that she appealed only to seek a modification of the "harsh" penalty and that she had been "deadset to plead guilty" after a court-appointed lawyer assured her she would only pay a fine [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the judgment of conviction is valid despite the missing record of the plea of guilty.
2. W/N the penalty of imprisonment was correctly imposed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that despite the missing page, other data in the record established that Cortez indeed pleaded guilty [3, 6]. The Court applied the presumption that official duty has been regularly performed under Sec. 5(m), Rule 131 of the Rules of Court, concluding that the trial court's statement regarding the guilty plea truly reflected what transpired [3, 7]. Furthermore, even assuming the plea was not entered in the record, Sec. 1, Rule 118 of the Rules of Court provides that the failure to enter a plea does not affect the validity of the proceedings [7, 8].

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the penalty of four months and one day of *arresto mayor* [9]. Under Art. 358 of the Revised Penal Code, grave slander of a serious and insulting nature is punishable by *arresto mayor* in its maximum period to *prision correccional* in its minimum period [10].

The appealed judgment is AFFIRMED [10].
