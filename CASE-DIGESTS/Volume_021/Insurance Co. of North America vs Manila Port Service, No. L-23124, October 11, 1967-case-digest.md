I. CAPTION
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-23124, October 11, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Philex Mining Corporation was the consignee of 351 cartons of medicine shipped on board the SS "Japan Bear," insured by Insurance Company of North America (plaintiff). The shipment arrived in Manila on June 23, 1961, and the cargo vans were discharged into the custody of the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service (MPS), on June 28, 1961, in good order. The keys to the vans remained with the vessel operators.

On July 19, 1961, the consignee requested the opening of the vans and discovered 50 cartons were wet and damaged. The consignee had filed a *provisional claim* on June 27, 1961 (one day before discharge) and a *formal claim* on July 31, 1961. MPS denied liability, arguing that the vessel retained the keys and that the claim was barred by the Management Contract, which required claims to be filed within 15 days from discharge. The insurer paid the consignee and sought reimbursement. The trial court ruled in favor of the insurer.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the arrastre operator is liable for the damage despite the vessel operator retaining the keys to the cargo vans.
2. W/N the provisional claim filed before the discharge of goods is valid.
3. W/N the formal claim filed more than 15 days after discharge was barred by the Management Contract.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The decisive factor in determining responsibility is not the possession of keys but the custody of the goods at the time the damage occurred. Since MPS received the cargo in good order and had custody until delivery, and failed to prove the damage occurred prior to its custody, it is liable [1].

2. **NO.** A provisional claim filed before the discharge of goods (in this case, one day prior) is premature and speculative. It does not serve the intended purpose of the requirement, which is to afford the arrastre operator a reasonable opportunity to check the validity of the claim while facts are fresh and documents are available [2].

3. **NO.** (The claim was not barred). While the Management Contract requires claims to be filed within 15 days from the discharge of the last package, this rule applies only when the consignee has knowledge of the discharge or damage. If knowledge is acquired later, the 15-day period commences from the date of knowledge or when it could have been secured with reasonable diligence. Here, there was no proof the consignee knew of the discharge or damage before the examination on July 19, 1961. Therefore, the formal claim filed on July 31, 1961, was within the allowable period [3, 4].

**Disposition:** Judgment affirmed with modification reducing the liability to the invoice value of P3,939.70 [5].
