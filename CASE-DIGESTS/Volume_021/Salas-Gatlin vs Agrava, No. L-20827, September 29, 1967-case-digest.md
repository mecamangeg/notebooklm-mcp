**I. CAPTION**
**ADELA S. SALAS-GATLIN v. HON. CORAZON AGRAVA, et al.**, G.R. No. L-20827, September 29, 1967, Fernando, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Adela S. Salas-Gatlin was the guardian of the property of the minor Augusto Salas, Jr. The minor inherited real properties subject to a condition in a Project of Partition that should he die without legitimate descendants, said properties and their fruits would pass to the petitioner. In June 1962, petitioner requested the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court (JDRC) for authority to purchase a parcel of land for the ward using the accumulated fruits of his inherited properties. She prayed that the certificate of title for the new purchase be annotated with the same condition regarding reversion to her.

Respondent Judge Corazon Agrava granted the authority to purchase but ordered that the property be registered exclusively in the ward's name, free from the condition that it would pass to petitioner upon his death without descendants. Petitioner filed motions for reconsideration, which were denied. She then filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the Judge acted without jurisdiction in altering the condition established in the Project of Partition. The ward, through a guardian *ad litem*, intervened, arguing that the petitioner lacked standing as she was not an "aggrieved party" in her capacity as guardian.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner, in her capacity as guardian, has the standing to challenge an order that is beneficial to her ward but prejudicial to her personal interest.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that the petitioner is not a "person aggrieved" eligible to file the petition because she instituted the action in her capacity as guardian, yet the order she challenges—which grants the ward fee simple ownership free of conditions—is manifestly beneficial to the ward.

It is settled law that a guardian cannot plead for a cause antagonistic to that of a ward [1]. Promoting her own personal interest (the reversionary right) at the expense of the ward violates the trust reposed in her. The Court cited *Salunga v. Evangelista* and *Garchitorena v. Sotelo*, emphasizing that a guardian cannot represent interests opposed to those of their ward [1, 2]. If the petitioner felt her personal interest was injured by the order, the proper procedure was to ask to be relieved of her trust as guardian so she could litigate in her personal capacity [3, 4]. Since she relied on her status as guardian to file the petition, the law does not sanction her action.

The petition for certiorari is **DISMISSED** [5].
