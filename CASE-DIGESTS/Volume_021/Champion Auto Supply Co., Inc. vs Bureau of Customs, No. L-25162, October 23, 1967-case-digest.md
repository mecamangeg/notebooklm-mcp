I. CAPTION
CHAMPION AUTO SUPPLY, CO., INC. v. THE BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-25162, October 23, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On March 24, 1964, the SS "Siquijor" delivered three cases of gears from Yokohama, Japan to the Bureau of Customs (BOC) in Manila, which was acting as the arrastre operator. The shipment was consigned to Champion Auto Supply Co., Inc. [1]. When the shipment was delivered to the consignee, the cases were empty; the missing contents were valued at P15,499.49 [2]. Champion Auto Supply filed a suit against the BOC in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to recover the value of the lost goods and attorney's fees. The CFI dismissed the complaint on the ground that the BOC is merely an agency of the Republic with no separate personality, and the suit is effectively against the State which cannot be sued without its consent [1, 2]. Champion Auto Supply appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Bureau of Customs can be sued for claims arising from its arrastre operations.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. Citing *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service*, the Court held that the Bureau of Customs cannot be sued for claims arising from its arrastre operations because these functions are undertaken as an incident of a prime governmental function [2]. Consequently, the doctrine of state immunity from suit applies. The Court further noted that the petitioner's fixed money claim could have been filed with the Auditor General under Act No. 3083 and Commonwealth Act No. 327 [2, 3].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [4].
