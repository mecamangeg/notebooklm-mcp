I. CAPTION
RAMON V. MITRA v. ABELARDO SUBIDO, in his capacity as Acting Commissioner of Civil Service, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21691, September 15, 1967, 21 SCRA 127, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Effective July 1, 1962, Manila Mayor Antonio Villegas appointed Ramon V. Mitra as Senior Technical Assistant in his office. The appointment was forwarded to the Civil Service Commission and approved by the Chief of the Personnel Transactions Division. Mitra assumed the post and received his salary for over six months. On January 11, 1963, Acting Commissioner of Civil Service Abelardo Subido informed the Mayor that the appointment was incomplete and violated certification requirements, alleging the Division Chief acted *ultra vires* in approving it. Subido ordered the termination of Mitra's services. Consequently, the City Auditor suspended Mitra's salary. Mitra filed a petition for mandamus. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Mitra, declaring the termination order null and void. Respondents appealed, arguing that Mitra lacked the appropriate civil service eligibility, failed to exhaust administrative remedies, and that the Commissioner had the power to correct the appointment.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Mitra's admission to the Bar constitutes the appropriate civil service eligibility for the position of Senior Technical Assistant.
2. W/N the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial intervention.
3. W/N the Acting Commissioner of Civil Service could validly revoke the appointment and summarily terminate Mitra's services.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under R.A. 1080, bar examinations are declared civil service examinations equivalent to first grade regular examinations for positions where the duties involve knowledge of the profession. The duties of the Senior Technical Assistant involve legal research and determining the applicability of laws to city administration. Only lawyers are technically equipped for these duties by reason of their academic preparation. Thus, Mitra's bar eligibility is appropriate for the position [1-4].

2. **NO.** The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is inapplicable when the question is purely legal, the act is patently illegal or performed without due process, or the respondent claims exclusive jurisdiction. Here, the Commissioner acted summarily without a semblance of due process, executing the order immediately. Furthermore, the Commissioner claimed his power to approve appointments is exclusive, rendering an appeal to the Civil Service Board of Appeals unavailable. Thus, immediate judicial recourse was proper [5-8].

3. **NO.** An appointment becomes complete when the appointee assumes the position under a known appointment that was not questioned for a significant period (here, six months). Even if the approval by the Division Chief was infirm, the presumption of regularity applies, and any irregularity is cured by the lapse of time and the appointee's absolute appointment. Once an appointment is complete, the appointee acquires a legal right protected by the Constitution and cannot be removed except for cause and with due process. The Commissioner's power to take "corrective measures" does not authorize the summary removal of an official with a vested title to the office. The termination was, in fact, a removal without cause [9-16].

Judgment affirmed.
