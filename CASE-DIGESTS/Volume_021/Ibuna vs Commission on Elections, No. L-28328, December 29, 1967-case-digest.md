I. CAPTION
NICANOR C. IBUNA v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, THE MUNICIPAL TREASURER, and BOARD OF CANVASSERS, SAN JUAN, RIZAL, G.R. No. L-28328, December 29, 1967, 21 SCRA 1457, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Nicanor C. Ibuna, the local Nacionalista Party chairman of San Juan, Rizal, filed a petition for certiorari challenging the Commission on Elections' (COMELEC) appointments of replacements for two municipal councilors sitting on the Municipal Board of Canvassers.

First, regarding Councilor Calixto Dungo: He was elected in 1963 with a certificate of candidacy stating he was a Nacionalista running as an independent. In 1967, he ran for reelection as a Nacionalista. COMELEC appointed Cesar Advincula, a Liberal, to replace him, arguing Dungo was an independent and could recommend his own replacement.

Second, regarding Councilor Arturo de Guzman: He was elected in 1963 as a Nacionalista but subsequently affiliated with the Liberal Party. When he ran for reelection in 1967, COMELEC appointed Arturo Casanova, a Liberal, to replace him. Petitioner argued the replacement should be a Nacionalista, adhering to De Guzman's party at the time of his election [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appointment of a Liberal to replace Councilor Dungo, who ran as a Nacionalista, was valid.
2. W/N the appointment of a Liberal to replace Councilor De Guzman, who was elected as a Nacionalista but switched to the Liberal Party, was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the appointment of a Liberal to replace Councilor Dungo was void. The records showed that in both his 1963 and 1967 certificates of candidacy, Dungo was a Nacionalista [2]. Section 167(a) of the Revised Election Code explicitly requires that members who are candidates "shall be replaced... with registered voters of the same party" [3]. Since Dungo was a Nacionalista, his replacement must be a registered voter of the Nacionalista Party, not a Liberal. The COMELEC's discretion does not extend to violating the explicit will of Congress [4].

2. **YES.** The Court sustained the appointment of a Liberal to replace Councilor De Guzman. The majority interpreted the literal language of Section 167(a) to mean that the replacement must belong to the same party as the member *at the time of the replacement/disqualification*, not necessarily the party under which they were elected [5]. Since De Guzman was a Liberal at the time he became a candidate in 1967, his replacement must be a Liberal. The Court noted that appointing a member of a different party (the opposing Nacionalista party) might unnecessarily upset the balance of power [5].

The petition was **PARTLY GRANTED** regarding the replacement of Dungo and **PARTLY DENIED** regarding the replacement of De Guzman [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Justices Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Fernando (Minority View):** They believed that to discourage turncoatism, the "party" referred to in the law should be the party at the time of election, not the new party after a switch. They argued that the right to replacement belongs to the party that helped the official get elected, not the individual candidate [7]. However, they conceded the law was ambiguous and required legislative correction.
