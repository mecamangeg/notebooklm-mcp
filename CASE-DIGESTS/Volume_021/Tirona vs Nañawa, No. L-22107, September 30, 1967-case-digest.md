**I. CAPTION**
CONSTANTINO TIRONA and THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS v. THE HONORABLE ARSENIO NAÑAWA and MARIANO RAYMUNDO, G.R. No. L-22107, September 30, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Mariano Raymundo applied for the registration of a parcel of land in Laguna. Petitioners Constantino Tirona and the Director of Lands opposed the application, claiming private ownership and public domain status, respectively [1, 2]. After numerous hearings and the presentation of evidence by the applicant, Raymundo filed a petition to archive the case pending clarification of the newly passed Agricultural Land Reform Code. Despite the oppositors' objections, respondent Judge Nañawa dismissed the case "without prejudice" on September 28, 1963 [2]. The Judge denied the petitioners' motion for reconsideration [2]. Petitioners filed a special civil action for certiorari and mandamus, arguing the dismissal was a grave abuse of discretion and neglect of duty [3]. Respondents argued that the proper remedy was an appeal, not certiorari [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petition for certiorari is the proper remedy despite the availability of an appeal.
2. W/N the dismissal of the registration case without prejudice was proper despite the presence of oppositors.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** While the general rule under Section 1, Rule 65 is that certiorari does not lie where an appeal may be taken, the Court relaxed this rule in the "interest of justice" [5, 6]. The order of dismissal was "patently wrong," and dismissing the current petition on procedural grounds would leave petitioners without an adequate remedy, as the period for appeal had lapsed [6]. It would be unjust to require the filing of a new application, causing further expense and trouble, when the rights could be decided in the existing case [6].

2. **NO.** Under Section 37 of Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act), as amended, a dismissal without prejudice is conditioned upon the "absence of an adverse claimant" [7]. Since there were adverse claimants (the petitioners), it was "incumbent and mandatory" for the trial court to determine the conflicting interests rather than dismiss the case [7]. Furthermore, the passage of the Agricultural Land Reform Code is not a valid ground for dismissal, as it does not affect pending land registration proceedings [8].

The writ is granted. The order of dismissal is set aside, and the lower court is ordered to reinstate the case and proceed with the hearing [9].
