I. CAPTION
VICTORIA JULIO v. EMILIANO DALANDAN and MARIA DALANDAN, G.R. No. L-19012, October 30, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On September 8, 1950, Clemente Dalandan, the deceased father of defendants Emiliano and Maria Dalandan, executed a sworn statement (*Salaysay*) acknowledging that a riceland owned by Victoriana Dalandan (plaintiff Victoria Julio's mother) was foreclosed because it was posted as security for Clemente's debt which he failed to pay. In the document, Clemente "promised" to replace the foreclosed land with another farm of more than four hectares, subject to the condition that his children (defendants) could not be forced to give up the harvest and that the land could not be demanded immediately. Plaintiff accepted the terms in the same document.

After Clemente's death, plaintiff demanded the land. Defendants refused, citing the stipulation that delivery could not be demanded immediately. Plaintiff initially acceded but later filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to be adjudged owner of the land and to fix a period for its delivery. Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground of prescription, arguing that more than 10 years had passed since the document's execution. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that the action had prescribed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N an express trust was created despite the absence of the word "trust" in the document.
2. W/N the plaintiff's action has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the document created an express trust. Although the deed did not explicitly name the defendants as trustees, it imposed a duty upon them to turn over both the fruits and the possession of the property to the plaintiff when the proper time comes. Under **Article 1444 of the Civil Code**, no particular words are required for the creation of an express trust; it is sufficient that a trust is clearly intended. Clemente Dalandan divested himself of naked ownership, transmitting only the right to enjoy the fruits (usufruct) to his heirs for an undetermined time, effectively holding the property as trustees for the plaintiff.

2. **NO.** Given the fiduciary relation recognized by the defendants in the complaint, they cannot invoke the statute of limitations. In a trust relationship, the trustee cannot plead prescription against the beneficiary unless the trust is repudiated. Furthermore, even assuming no trust was constituted, the plaintiff is protected by **Article 1141 of the Civil Code**, which provides that "real actions over immovables prescribe after thirty years." Since the motion to dismiss was based on the prescription of the plaintiff's action (not acquisitive prescription), the 10-year period did not apply.

The Order of the lower court is **REVERSED** and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
