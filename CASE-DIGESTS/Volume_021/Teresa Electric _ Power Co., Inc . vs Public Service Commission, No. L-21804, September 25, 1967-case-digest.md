I. CAPTION
TERESA ELECTRIC AND POWER CO., INC. v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION AND FILIPINAS CEMENT CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-21804, September 25, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Teresa Electric and Power Co., Inc. (Teresa) operated an electric plant in Teresa, Rizal under a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC). Respondent Filipinas Cement Corporation (Filipinas), a cement manufacturer, applied for a CPC on May 24, 1962, to establish and operate an electric plant in the same municipality [1]. Filipinas intended to use the plant exclusively to supply power to its cement factory and provide free light to employees living within its compound, buying power from MERALCO rather than generating it [2]. Teresa opposed the application, arguing that Filipinas was not authorized by its Articles of Incorporation to operate an electric plant, had not secured a municipal franchise, and that Teresa was already operating in the area [3]. The Public Service Commission (PSC) granted the CPC to Filipinas on March 15, 1963 [2]. Teresa’s motion to set aside was denied, leading to this petition for review [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a municipal or legislative franchise is a condition precedent for Filipinas to obtain a CPC.
2. W/N Filipinas is authorized by its Articles of Incorporation to operate an electric plant.
3. W/N Filipinas is entitled to a CPC despite the existence of Teresa as an operator in the same municipality.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A municipal franchise is not required. The Court held that Act No. 667, which requires a municipal franchise, applies exclusively to entities maintaining an electric line "for business purposes," meaning to render service to the general public for compensation [5]. It does not apply to Filipinas, which applied for a CPC to operate a plant "exclusively for its own use" in its factory and for the free use of its employees [5]. A CPC from the PSC is sufficient for this purpose [6].

2. **YES.** Filipinas is authorized. Paragraph 7 of its Articles of Incorporation authorizes it to secure rights and franchises necessary or related to its factory operation [6]. The Court ruled that the operation of an electric plant is necessarily connected with the business of manufacturing cement, noting that electricity is a necessity for such industries [7].

3. **YES.** The CPC was properly granted. While prior operators deserve protection, nobody has an exclusive right to a franchise or CPC [8]. Public service and interest are the primordial considerations. Furthermore, Teresa was in no condition to supply the power needs of Filipinas; Teresa had a load capacity of only 200 kilowatts, whereas Filipinas required 6,000 kilowatts to operate its factory [8].

The decision of the Public Service Commission is affirmed [9].
