I. CAPTION
ASELA P. TACTAQUIN v. JOSE B. PALILEO, G.R. No. L-20865, September 29, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On June 16, 1961, respondent Jose B. Palileo recklessly drove a car in Valenzuela, Bulacan, striking petitioner Asela P. Tactaquin and her daughter, Norma. Tactaquin suffered serious physical injuries while Norma died [1]. Palileo was prosecuted in the Court of First Instance of Bulacan (Criminal Case No. 4736) for homicide with serious physical injuries through reckless negligence [1]. He was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment and to pay P4,000.00 in damages to the offended party [2]. On September 7, 1962, Tactaquin filed the present civil action in the Court of First Instance of Rizal to recover P37,686.35 in damages for the same accident [1]. Palileo moved to dismiss on the ground that the claim was barred by the final judgment in the criminal case [1]. The trial court dismissed the complaint [3]. Tactaquin appealed, arguing that her cause of action was based on quasi-delict and was independent of the criminal action [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the separate civil action for damages is barred by the prior judgment in the criminal case.
2. W/N the reservation to institute a separate civil action was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the action is barred. While Article 2177 of the New Civil Code provides that responsibility for quasi-delict is separate from civil liability arising from a crime, it explicitly states that "the plaintiff cannot recover damages twice for the same act or omission of the defendant" [5]. In this case, the civil liability—whether based on quasi-delict or crime—arose from the exact same act: Palileo's reckless driving. Since Palileo was already sentenced to pay damages in the criminal case for this specific act, Tactaquin cannot recover again [5].

2. **NO.** The reservation to institute a separate civil action was deemed legally ineffective because the record showed it was made after the defendant had already pleaded guilty and after the private prosecutor had entered his appearance jointly with the prosecuting attorney in the criminal proceedings [3].

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Justices Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred; Justice Makalintal took no part; Justice Bengzon, J.P. was on leave) [6].
