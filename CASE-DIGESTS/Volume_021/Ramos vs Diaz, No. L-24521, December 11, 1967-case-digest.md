I. CAPTION
EDILBERTO M. RAMOS v. HON. RAMON A. DIAZ, et al., G.R. No. L-24521, December 11, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Col. Edilberto Ramos was compulsorily retired on September 22, 1963, for having completed 30 years of service in the Armed Forces of the Philippines [1]. However, respondents withheld the payment of his retirement benefits under Republic Act No. 340 because Ramos had several pending criminal cases, including estafa and malversation of public funds allegedly committed during his service [2, 3]. The order of retirement specified that benefits would be paid only after he submitted clearances regarding these charges and his money/property accountabilities [3]. Ramos demanded payment, arguing that his compulsory retirement automatically established his "satisfactory service" and vested his right to benefits [4]. After his requests were denied by the Office of the President, Ramos filed a petition for Mandamus to compel payment [2, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the payment of retirement benefits under the Armed Forces Retirement Act (R.A. 340) may be withheld pending the resolution of criminal charges against the retiree.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that Section 1 of R.A. 340 explicitly requires "continuous satisfactory active service" as a condition for granting benefits [3, 6]. The fact that a member is compulsorily retired after 30 years does not automatically entitle them to benefits if pending criminal charges cast doubt upon the satisfactoriness of their service [3]. The Court clarified that withholding benefits does not violate the constitutional presumption of innocence; the retiree is not being punished, but rather, the satisfactoriness of his service—a statutory prerequisite—is put in issue and must be resolved before payment can be made [7]. Consequently, since Mandamus lies only when the petitioner's right is "clear and indubitable," and Ramos's right was not yet established, the writ could not be issued [8].

Petition denied [9].
