I. CAPTION
DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BARBER LINE, MACONDRAY & CO., INC. and/or REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-23879, November 18, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Domestic Insurance Company of the Philippines, acting as insurer-subrogee, filed a suit for money to indemnify for the non-delivery of part of a cargo shipment [1]. The cargo arrived in Manila on June 24, 1963, on board the SS Queensville and was discharged into the custody of the arrastre operator, the Republic of the Philippines (through the Bureau of Customs) [1], [2]. Due to alleged negligence, the shipment sustained losses amounting to P8,800.92 [2]. The Republic moved to dismiss the complaint against it, arguing that the State is immune from suit without its consent [2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the case as to the Republic, prompting the plaintiff to appeal [3], [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Republic of the Philippines may be sued for its operation of the arrastre service without its consent.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal, reiterating the doctrine laid down in *Mobil Philippine Exploration v. Customs Arrastre Service* and subsequent cases [4]. The Court ruled that in operating the arrastre service through the Bureau of Customs, the Republic does so as an incident of the prime governmental function of assessment and collection of revenues, tariffs, and customs duties from importations [4]. As such, the Republic performs a governmental function and may not be sued without its consent [4]. The order of dismissal is affirmed [5].
