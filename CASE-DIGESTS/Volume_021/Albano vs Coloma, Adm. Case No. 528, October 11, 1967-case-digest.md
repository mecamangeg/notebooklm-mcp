I. CAPTION
ANGEL ALBANO v. ATTY. PERPETUA COLOMA, Adm. Case No. 528, October 11, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Angel Albano and his mother retained the services of respondent Atty. Perpetua Coloma during the Japanese occupation for Civil Case No. 4147 in the CFI of Ilocos Norte. After liberation, Albano alleged that Coloma failed to expedite the case, forcing them to hire new counsel. Coloma intervened in the civil case to enforce her attorney's lien based on a document promising her a contingent fee of 33-1/3% of the recovery. Albano claimed this document was falsified and the signatures forged, relying on an NBI report stating the signatures were not genuine.

In the proceedings for the attorney's lien in Civil Case No. 4147, the CFI found the document to be genuine and valid. This finding was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 10563-R, which noted Coloma's diligent service for seven years. Despite these rulings, Albano filed this disbarment case against Coloma based on the same allegation of falsification. The Solicitor General recommended dismissal, noting that the issue of the document's genuineness had already been litigated.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the disbarment case is barred by the prior judgments declaring the fee contract genuine.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court dismissed the charge, holding that the fundamental principle of *res judicata* applies to all cases and proceedings, including disbarment. A party cannot escape the bar of a judgment against him in a new suit on the same cause of action by varying the form of his action or adopting a different method of presenting his case.

The Court affirmed the Solicitor General's findings that the genuineness of the document was already established by the CFI and the Court of Appeals. The NBI report submitted by the complainant, which lacked supporting reasons, could not prevail over the judicial findings and positive testimony of witnesses. The Court emphasized that counsel is entitled to full recompense for services rendered and viewed with disapproval the complainant's attempt to deprive respondent of her hard-earned honorarium after she had successfully secured justice for them.

The charge against respondent is DISMISSED.
