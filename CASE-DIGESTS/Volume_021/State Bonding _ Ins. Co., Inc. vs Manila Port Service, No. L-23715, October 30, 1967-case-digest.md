**I. CAPTION**
STATE BONDING & INSURANCE CO., INC. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-23715, October 30, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
State Bonding & Insurance Co., Inc. (plaintiff), as subrogee to the consignees of seven shipments, filed an action against Manila Port Service (defendant arrastre operator) to recover the value of goods that were either short-delivered or delivered in bad order [1]. The plaintiff filed provisional claims within the 15-day period prescribed by Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract, followed by formal claims after said period [2]. The defendants argued that the provisional claims were insufficient because they were "form-letters" lacking statements of value, extent of damage, and supporting documents like invoices or bills of lading [3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the plaintiff, ordering the defendants to pay P3,370.54 plus interest [1, 4]. The defendants appealed, contending that the contract required fully documented claims [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N provisional claims filed without statements of value or supporting documents constitute substantial compliance with the Management Contract [2].

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that a provisional claim constitutes substantial compliance with the Management Contract if it describes the importation sufficiently to allow the arrastre operator a reasonable verification of the claim [5]. This holds true even if the claim does not state the value of the goods or attach supporting papers [5].

In this case, the Court found that the provisional claims satisfied the requirements because they specified the bill of lading numbers, consignee names, marks and numbers on the goods, descriptions of the goods, names of the carrying vessels, and dates of arrival [5]. The Court relied on established jurisprudence, specifically *State Bonding & Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Manila Port Service* (L-21833) and *Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. vs. United Philippine Lines, Inc.* [5].

**Decision affirmed.**
