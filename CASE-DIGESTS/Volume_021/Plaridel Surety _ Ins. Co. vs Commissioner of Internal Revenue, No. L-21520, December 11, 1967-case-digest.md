I. CAPTION
PLARIDEL SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-21520, December 11, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Plaridel Surety issued a performance bond for Constancio San Jose in favor of P.L. Galang Machinery Co. To protect itself, Petitioner obtained indemnity agreements from San Jose and Ramon Cuervo, secured by chattel and real estate mortgages, respectively [1]. San Jose defaulted, leading to a court judgment holding Petitioner liable on the bond but ordering San Jose and Cuervo to reimburse Petitioner [2]. In 1957, Petitioner paid Galang Machinery P44,490.00 and claimed this amount as a deductible loss in its 1957 income tax return [3]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) disallowed the deduction and assessed a deficiency. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the CIR, ruling that the loss was "compensable otherwise than by insurance" via the mortgages and rights to reimbursement, and that Petitioner failed to exhaust its remedies against the indemnitors [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the payment made by Petitioner in 1957 is a deductible loss under the Tax Code.
2. W/N Petitioner can raise the issue of interest deduction for the first time on appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that under Section 30(d)(2) of the National Internal Revenue Code, a loss is deductible only if "not compensated for by insurance or otherwise." Here, Petitioner's loss was compensable through the mortgages and the final judgment for reimbursement against San Jose and Cuervo [5]. A loss deduction is denied if there is a measurable right to compensation; the taxpayer must first exhaust remedies to recover or reduce the loss [6]. Petitioner failed to prove it exhausted remedies, such as levying on the properties of San Jose or Cuervo, or proving their insolvency [7]. Furthermore, Petitioner failed to prove that the loss was "charged-off" within the taxable year, which is a statutory requisite for corporations claiming loss deductions [8, 9].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that since the claimed interest deduction of P10,000.00 was never raised or litigated before the Court of Tax Appeals, it was too late to raise and assert it before the Supreme Court [9].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **AFFIRMED** [10].
