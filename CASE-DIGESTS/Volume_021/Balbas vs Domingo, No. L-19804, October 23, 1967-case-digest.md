**I. CAPTION**
LEON BALBAS, DONATO ABITONG, and NEMESIO VALDEZ v. MELECIO R. DOMINGO, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. L-19804, October 23, 1967, Fernando, J.

**II. FACTS**
On August 10, 1956, petitioners individually executed "Harvest Contracts" with Canlubang Sugar Estate to recruit laborers and harvest sugar cane [1]. Under the contracts, petitioners were obliged to recruit men (preferably from Ilocos), pay for their own recruiting and transportation expenses, and supervise the harvesting work [2, 3]. Canlubang paid petitioners based on a fixed rate per ton, from which the laborers were remunerated [3]. Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Domingo) classified petitioners as independent contractors and assessed them for fixed and percentage taxes, surcharges, and penalties [1]. Petitioners contested the assessment, arguing they were employees subject to Canlubang's control regarding harvest schedules and strict rules on cutting and delivery [4]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) sustained the Commissioner, ruling that the petitioners' power to hire men and obligation to defray expenses affirmed their independent status [2, 3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N petitioners are independent contractors subject to fixed and percentage taxes under the Tax Code. [2, 5]

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the CTA. The Court held that it is bound by the factual findings of the CTA, which determined that the terms of the contract and the actual performance of obligations established an independent contractor relationship [6, 7]. Specifically, the petitioners recruited their own laborers, paid for their subsistence and transportation, and were responsible for the tools and equipment provided by Canlubang [3]. While Canlubang exercised supervision to ensure work was done according to company rules and schedules, this did not constitute control over the means and methods sufficient to create an employer-employee relationship [4, 8]. Consequently, petitioners are liable for fixed and percentage taxes pursuant to Sections 182 and 191 of the National Internal Revenue Code (Commonwealth Act No. 466), which imposes a tax on independent contractors [1, 2].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [9].
