I. CAPTION
MARIA A. GARCIA, ET AL. v. RITA LEGARDA, INC., G.R. No. L-20175, October 30, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, spouses Garcia and Timbang, acquired rights to three Contracts to Sell (Nos. 322, 324, and 965) covering residential lots in Manila from the original buyers of respondent Rita Legarda, Inc. [1-3]. Paragraph 6 of the contracts stipulated that if the vendee fails to pay installments, they are granted a one-month grace period, followed by an additional 90-day period. If payment is not made within this time, the vendor has the right to declare the contract cancelled and of no effect [4].

Petitioners failed to pay stipulated monthly installments from August 1951 through June 1952 [3]. After the expiration of the grace periods, respondent cancelled the contracts on June 11, 1952 [3]. Petitioners filed a complaint to declare the contracts subsisting, arguing that the cancellation clause violated Article 1308 of the Civil Code (mutuality of contracts) and that respondent waived its right to cancel by previously accepting late payments [5, 6]. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of petitioners, but the Court of Appeals reversed the decision [5, 7].

III. ISSUES
1. W/N the contractual stipulation granting the vendor the right to cancel upon default violates Article 1308 of the Civil Code.
2. W/N the respondent waived its right to cancel the contracts by previously accepting late payments.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the stipulation does not violate Article 1308, which prohibits leaving the validity or compliance of a contract to the will of one party [8, 9]. The stipulation merely gives the vendor the right to cancel upon the fulfillment of specific conditions: the vendee's default and failure to pay within the grace periods [9]. This power is not immoral or arbitrary because it can only be exercised if the other party commits a breach. As held in *Taylor v. Ky Tieng Piao*, a contract giving one party the right to cancel if a resolutory condition is not fulfilled is valid [10].

2. **NO.** The Court held that accepting payment of installments in arrears prior to cancellation was merely an act of forbearance and humanity to give the vendee an opportunity to keep the contract alive [11, 12]. This acceptance does not create a presumption of waiver; rather, it strengthens the vendor's right to cancel when the vendee subsequently defaults again and again despite the accommodation [12, 13].

The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals [14].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Concepcion, Reyes, Makalintal, Bengzon, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred [14].
