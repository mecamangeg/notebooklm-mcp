I. CAPTION
LILIA PEÑA, NENITA TISBE, RODRIGO GELLE, CARLOS LEYNES and ROGELIO MAGSINO v. HON. DAMASO S. TENGCO and WENCESLAO VIVAS, G.R. No. L-28395, December 26, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
In the November 14, 1967 elections for Councilor of Lipa City, petitioner Rogelio Magsino and respondent Wenceslao Vivas were candidates [1]. Magsino sought a recount in Election Case No. 1888, where the ballot boxes for Precinct 94 were opened. During this recount, Vivas claimed he obtained 64 votes, although the returns indicated only 60 [1, 2]. The Judge did not make a formal finding confirming Vivas's 64 votes at that time [3].

Subsequently, the members of the Board of Election Inspectors (petitioners Peña, et al.) filed Election Case No. 1895. They unanimously petitioned to correct the election returns for Precinct 94 to increase Magsino's votes from 61 to 69, citing fatigue and poor lighting as the cause of the error [4]. They did not request any correction regarding Vivas's votes [5]. On December 6, 1967, respondent Judge Tengco issued an order granting the correction for Magsino but also directed the Board of Canvassers to credit Vivas with 64 votes instead of 60, relying solely on Vivas's statement during the previous recount [5]. Magsino and the Board members filed this petition for certiorari challenging the order regarding Vivas [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in ordering the correction of the election returns to increase Vivas's votes without the unanimous consent of the Board of Inspectors.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion.

Under Section 154 of the Revised Election Code and established jurisprudence, the correction of election returns may be ordered only upon the unanimous consent of all members of the Board of Inspectors [7]. In this case, the correction for Magsino was proper because it was supported by the Board's unanimous petition and confirmed by the recount. However, the Board never petitioned to correct Vivas's votes.

The Court held that the Judge could not order the correction for Vivas based merely on Vivas's own claim during the previous recount (Case No. 1888), especially since the Judge made no specific factual finding in that previous case that Vivas actually received 64 votes [3]. To modify the returns based solely on the respondent's statement is to "pass the line which divides averment from established fact" [8].

Petition **GRANTED**. The order of the respondent Judge, insofar as it directs the correction of the election returns with respect to respondent Wenceslao Vivas, is declared **NULL and VOID** [9].
