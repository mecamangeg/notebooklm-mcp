**I. CAPTION**
ANTONIO V. ROQUE v. BIENVENIDO P. BUAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22459, October 31, 1967, Angeles, J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 12, 1955, petitioner Antonio V. Roque was a passenger on a "Philippine Rabbit" bus operated by the respondents, the administrators of the Estate of the Buan spouses [1, 2]. While crossing the Sulipan Bridge in Apalit, Pampanga, the bus driver swerved to the right to avoid a cargo truck coming from the opposite direction [3]. The bus side-swiped the bridge railing, causing the iron grills of the window where Roque was seated to detach and his right arm to be severely injured [3].

Roque filed a suit for damages for breach of contract of carriage. The trial court ruled in favor of Roque, finding that the driver was negligent for running at a high speed (60 kph) and hitting the railing, awarding actual damages, attorney's fees, and moral damages [4, 5]. However, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the decision [4]. While the CA agreed there was damage to the bus, it concluded that Roque must have extended his arm outside the window to sustain such injuries, thereby attributing the fault to him [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the trial court’s finding of negligence on the part of the common carrier.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to moral damages.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court reinstated the trial court's findings, holding that the CA’s conclusion that Roque extended his arm was grounded entirely on speculation and was contrary to the physical evidence [7]. The extent of the damage to the bus—dented rear, detached and dangling iron grills—demonstrated violent contact with the bridge railing caused by the driver’s lack of care while driving at an unreasonable speed [7, 8]. The Court applied the exception to the rule that CA factual findings are binding, noting the inference was manifestly mistaken [9]. Furthermore, under Article 1756 of the Civil Code, common carriers are presumed negligent when a passenger is injured, unless they prove extraordinary diligence, which the respondents failed to do [10, 11].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that moral damages are not recoverable in actions based on a breach of contract of carriage resulting in mere physical injuries, unless the carrier acted fraudulently or in bad faith [12]. There was no proof of bad faith in this case.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED**, and the decision of the Court of First Instance is affirmed with the modification that the award of moral damages is eliminated [11, 12].
