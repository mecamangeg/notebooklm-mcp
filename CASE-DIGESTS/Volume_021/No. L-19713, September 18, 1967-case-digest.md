I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF BONIFACIO SY *alias* SY KIM TAH TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. BONIFACIO SY *alias* SY KIM TAH v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-19713, September 18, 1967, Dizon, J. [1-3]

II. FACTS
On May 25, 1961, Bonifacio Sy *alias* Sy Kim Tah filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Cebu [3]. He claimed to have an annual income of P7,200.00, or P600.00 monthly, derived from his employment as a salesman for Asiatic Commercial and Silver Cup Wine Factory [3, 4]. The lower court granted the petition, but the Solicitor General appealed, arguing inter alia that the petitioner failed to prove he had a lucrative income [5]. The record revealed that the petitioner's alleged employers were his close relatives: Asiatic Commercial was owned by his mother-in-law, and Silver Cup Wine Factory was owned by his uncle [4]. Furthermore, the petitioner did not file any income tax returns regarding the income he allegedly received from these entities [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner has a lucrative income derived from a lawful profession [5].

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, holding that the petitioner failed to establish his alleged income with indubitable evidence [4, 6]. The Court doubted the veracity of the claim because the alleged employers were the petitioner's close relatives and he failed to file income tax returns in relation to said income [4]. Without indubitable proof, the petitioner is deemed to have no lucrative income derived from a lawful profession, which is a requirement for naturalization [7].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** [6].
