I. CAPTION
CALTEX (PHILIPPINES) INC. v. CUSTOMS ARRASTRE SERVICE, BUREAU OF CUSTOMS and REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-26947, December 26, 1967, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
On February 4, 1964, Caltex (Philippines) Inc. filed a suit in the City Court of Manila against the Customs Arrastre Service, Bureau of Customs, and the Republic of the Philippines to recover P223.77. This amount represented the value of lost goods (one vial of special reagent napthalene and one gallon of tygon thinner) from a shipment discharged into the custody of the defendants as the arrastre operator in Manila on March 24, 1963 [1, 2].

The defendants raised the defense of non-suability of the State [3]. The City Court rejected this defense and ordered the defendants to pay the amount claimed. On appeal, the Court of First Instance affirmed the decision, holding the defendants liable [3]. The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court on the question of law regarding their suability without consent [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Customs Arrastre Service and the Republic of the Philippines can be sued without their consent for damages resulting from arrastre operations.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The government is not subject to suit in court without its consent for damages resulting from its arrastre operations. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, applying the ruling in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service* (L-23139, December 17, 1966) [4, 5]. The Court held that arrastre operations performed by the Bureau of Customs are a necessary incident to the prime governmental function of taxation. Therefore, public policy considerations bring these operations within the scope of the doctrine of government immunity from suit [4, 6, 7].

Accordingly, the judgment of the lower court is reversed [8].
