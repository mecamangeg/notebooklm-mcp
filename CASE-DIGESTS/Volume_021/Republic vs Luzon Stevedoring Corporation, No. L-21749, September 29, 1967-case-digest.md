I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LUZON STEVEDORING CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-21749, September 29, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On August 17, 1960, barge L-1892, owned by Luzon Stevedoring Corporation (appellant), was being towed down the Pasig River by two of its tugboats, "Bangus" and "Barbero." The barge rammed into the wooden piles of the Nagtahan bailey bridge, smashing the posts and causing the bridge to list. At the time, the river was swollen and the current was swift due to heavy rains. The Republic of the Philippines (appellee) sued for actual damages. Luzon Stevedoring disclaimed liability, arguing it exercised due diligence by assigning powerful tugs and competent personnel, and that the accident was caused by *force majeure*. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the Republic, ordering Luzon Stevedoring to pay P192,561.72 for repairs. The corporation appealed directly to the Supreme Court, raising questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the collision was caused by *force majeure* exempting the appellant from liability.
2. W/N the trial court erred in admitting additional evidence from the plaintiff after it had rested its case.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the collision was not a case of *force majeure*. Considering the Nagtahan bridge is an immovable object, the unusual event of a barge ramming it raises a presumption of negligence under the rule of *res ipsa loquitur* [1]. Under Article 1174 of the Civil Code, *caso fortuito* or *force majeure* refers to events that are impossible to foresee or avoid; mere difficulty in foreseeing the event is insufficient [2]. The very precautions adopted by the appellant—assigning powerful tugs and double-checking equipment—proved that the possibility of danger was foreseen [2]. By voluntarily entering the swollen river with its swift current, the appellant assumed the risk and cannot shed responsibility merely because its precautions proved insufficient [3].

2. **NO.** The reception of further evidence after a party has rested its case lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge [4]. This discretion will not be reviewed except in a clear case of abuse. No abuse was found, as the court merely allowed vouchers to support an item of expenditure, and the appellant was granted a similar privilege to adduce additional evidence [5].

The decision of the lower court is AFFIRMED.
