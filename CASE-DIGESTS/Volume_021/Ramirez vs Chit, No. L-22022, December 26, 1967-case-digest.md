I. CAPTION
EMILIANO T. RAMIREZ v. JOSE SY CHIT, G.R. No. L-22022, December 26, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Emiliano Ramirez (plaintiff) owned a parcel of land in Manila leased to Jose Sy Chit (defendant) since 1946 on a monthly basis. In 1962, Ramirez notified Chit to vacate as he intended to construct a new building. Chit refused, leading Ramirez to file an ejectment suit in the Municipal Court. Chit invoked Article 1687 of the Civil Code, asking the court to fix the period of the lease. The Municipal Court fixed the term to expire on June 30, 1963, and ordered Chit to pay current rentals, P200.00 attorney's fees, and P25.00 per day as damages for every day of delay. Chit appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI). Pending appeal, the CFI ordered execution of the judgment due to Chit's failure to pay rentals. The CFI eventually affirmed the Municipal Court's decision *in toto*. Chit appealed to the Supreme Court, challenging the jurisdiction of the lower court to fix the lease period and the award of damages.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Municipal Court loses jurisdiction over an ejectment case when the defendant invokes Article 1687 of the Civil Code to fix the lease period.
2. W/N the court abused its discretion in the duration of the period fixed for the lease.
3. W/N the award of P25.00 per day as damages in addition to monthly rentals is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Municipal Court retains jurisdiction. The power to extend the lease period under Article 1687 of the Civil Code when the lessee has been in occupancy for more than a year is not a separate action that must be filed in the Court of First Instance. It is a power that may be exercised as an incident in the ejectment action itself to preserve the summary character of the proceeding [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The power of the court to fix a longer period is discretionary. There was no abuse of discretion because the defendant was not personally occupying the premises but was subleasing them for income. The period granted (until June 30, 1963) was reasonable, being more than a year from the first notice to vacate [3].

3. **NO.** The damages recoverable by a plaintiff under Section 1, Rule 70 are limited to the reasonable value of the use and occupation of the property, which in this case is the agreed monthly rental of P230.00. The award of P25.00 damages for every day of delay *in addition* to the agreed rental is without basis in law [4].

The decision is AFFIRMED with the modification that the award of P25.00 daily damages is set aside [5].
