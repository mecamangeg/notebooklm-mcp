I. CAPTION
EUSTAQUIO AMOREN and DOROTEA AMOREN v. THE HONORABLE HERNANDO PINEDA, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Lanao del Norte, and DIONISIO CANONEO, et al., G.R. No. L-23666, September 29, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Spouses Amoren filed an action for forcible entry and detainer against private respondents in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Kapatagan, Lanao del Norte. The JP Court declared respondents in default and ordered them to vacate the premises.

Respondents subsequently filed a case in the Court of First Instance (CFI) to annul the JP judgment, arguing the JP Court lacked jurisdiction because the land was allegedly in another municipality (Lala). The CFI dismissed this complaint, upholding the JP Court's jurisdiction. Respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals, but the appeal was dismissed for failure to file a brief, rendering the decision final.

After the Sheriff delivered the property to petitioners, respondents allegedly re-entered the land. Petitioners filed a petition for contempt in the CFI. Respondent Judge Pineda dismissed the contempt petition, ruling that the JP Court judgment was void *ab initio* for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter. Petitioners filed this petition for *Certiorari* and *Mandamus*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent Judge could dismiss the contempt charge based on the JP Court's alleged lack of jurisdiction.
2. W/N the dismissal of the contempt charge is appealable or reviewable.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The respondent Judge’s order is untenable because the issue of jurisdiction is already *res judicata*. The jurisdiction of the JP Court had been previously upheld by the CFI in a separate civil case, and that decision became final when the private respondents' appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeals. Consequently, the fact of jurisdiction is no longer open to debate [1].

2. **YES.** While an acquittal in a contempt charge is generally not appealable like a criminal acquittal, this rule does not apply where there has been no adjudication on the merits. In this case, the ruling was a dismissal based on a jurisdictional ground (motion to dismiss), not a trial on the merits [2]. The remedy was not an appeal under Rule 71, Section 10 (which applies to convicted contemnors), but the current petition.

The petition is **GRANTED**. The order complained of is set aside, and the records are remanded to the lower court to reopen proceedings and adjudicate the contempt charge on its merits [3].
