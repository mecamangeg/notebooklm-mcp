I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FORTUNATO BUCO, G.R. No. L-19831, September 5, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On August 17, 1954, a charge of rebellion was filed against the accused-appellant Fortunato Buco, covering acts committed from 1946 to 1954. On May 17, 1955, after the rebellion charge was filed, Buco and his companions killed Conrado G. Dizon, the Municipal Mayor of Sta. Ana, Pampanga. Buco was arrested in 1956 and subsequently convicted of rebellion in July 1959.

On November 1, 1959, an information for murder was filed against Buco for the killing of Mayor Dizon. Buco admitted to the killing in his extrajudicial statement and court testimony, revealing that the killing was ordered by a civilian named Luna because Dizon was "not good when it comes to the land" regarding a 90-hectare property Dizon administered. The Court of First Instance of Pampanga convicted Buco of murder and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*. Buco appealed, arguing double jeopardy and contending that the killing was absorbed in the crime of rebellion for which he had already been sentenced.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the killing of the victim is absorbed in the crime of rebellion.
2. W/N the mitigating circumstance of a plea of guilty should be appreciated.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The killing is not absorbed in the offense of rebellion. First, the act of killing occurred on May 17, 1955, which was *after* the filing of the rebellion charge on August 17, 1954; thus, it could not have been included in that previous charge [1]. Second, the accused failed to establish that the killing was committed in furtherance of rebellion. The evidence showed the motive was personal and private—specifically a dispute over the administration of land—rather than political or ideological [2]. The Court cited *People v. Egual* to support the principle that acts committed after the filing of a rebellion charge are not absorbed therein [1].

2. **NO.** The mitigating circumstance of a plea of guilty cannot be considered because the admission of the killing took place after the prosecution had already presented its evidence. Under Art. 13, No. 7 of the Revised Penal Code, a plea of guilty must be made prior to the presentation of evidence by the prosecution to be mitigating [3].

The judgment appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
