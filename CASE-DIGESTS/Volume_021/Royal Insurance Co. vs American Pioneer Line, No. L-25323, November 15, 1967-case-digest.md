I. CAPTION
ROYAL INSURANCE COMPANY, plaintiff-appellee, vs. AMERICAN PIONEER LINE, ET AL., defendants; REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, defendant-appellant, G.R. No. L-25323, November 15, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On December 17, 1962, the SS "Pioneer Ming" arrived in Manila and discharged 32 packages of auto parts unto the custody of the Bureau of Customs as arrastre operator. The shipment was consigned to White House Auto Supply and insured by Royal Insurance Company. Only 31 packages were received by the consignee; one case worth P732.26 was lost. Royal Insurance paid the loss and, as subrogee, filed a suit for recovery against several defendants, including the Republic of the Philippines as arrastre operator.

The Court of First Instance of Manila absolved the other defendants but ordered the Republic of the Philippines to pay the claim. The Republic appealed, arguing it cannot be sued without its consent and that the claim should have been filed with the Auditor General.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Republic of the Philippines may be sued for its operation of the arrastre service.
2. W/N the claim for sum of money should have been filed with the Auditor General.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Republic may not be sued without its consent. The Bureau of Customs and the Customs Arrastre Service perform the arrastre service as a necessary incident to the primary governmental function of taxation. Even if the arrastre service is proprietary in nature, its character as a necessary incident to a governmental function shields the Republic and its agencies from suit under the doctrine of state immunity (*Mobil Philippines Exploration v. Customs Arrastre Service*).

2. **YES.** The claim is a money claim for a fixed amount determinable by accessible papers. Under Act No. 3083, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 327, such claims must be filed with the Auditor General. It is not an unliquidated claim that falls outside the Auditor General's power to decide.

The judgment appealed from is REVERSED and the case against the Republic of the Philippines is DISMISSED.
