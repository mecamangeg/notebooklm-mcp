I. CAPTION
RAMON A. GONZALES v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, DIRECTOR OF PRINTING and AUDITOR GENERAL; PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION ASSOCIATION (PHILCONSA) v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, G.R. Nos. L-28196 & L-28224, November 9, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On March 16, 1967, the Senate and House of Representatives passed Resolution of Both Houses (R.B.H.) Nos. 1, 2, and 3. R.B.H. No. 1 proposed increasing the House membership from 120 to 180. R.B.H. No. 2 called for a Constitutional Convention in 1971. R.B.H. No. 3 proposed allowing Members of Congress to serve as delegates to the convention without forfeiting their seats. subsequently, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 4913, approved on June 17, 1967, submitting the amendments proposed in R.B.H. Nos. 1 and 3 for ratification by the people during the general elections on November 14, 1967.

Petitioner Ramon Gonzales and the Philippine Constitution Association (PHILCONSA) filed separate petitions for prohibition to restrain the implementation of R.A. 4913. They argued that: (1) Congress was merely a *de facto* body due to its failure to pass a reapportionment law since the 1960 census, rendering its acts void; (2) Congress could not simultaneously propose amendments and call a convention; (3) amendments must be submitted in a special election, not a general one; and (4) R.A. 4913 violates the Constitution because the proposed amendments are not properly "submitted" to the people for sufficient study and intelligent ratification.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review the validity of acts of Congress acting as a constituent assembly.
2. W/N the 1967 Congress was a mere *de facto* body due to failure to reapportion, rendering the proposed amendments null and void.
3. W/N Congress may propose amendments and call for a constitutional convention at the same time.
4. W/N constitutional amendments may be submitted for ratification in a general election.
5. W/N R.A. 4913 is unconstitutional for failing to provide a proper submission of the amendments to the people.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The issue is justiciable, not political. The power to amend the Constitution is not a general legislative power but inherent in the people. When Congress acts as a constituent assembly, it derives authority from the Constitution, and the Court may determine if it has acted within constitutional limits. The doctrine in *Mabanag v. Lopez Vito* characterizing such issues as political is modified.

2. **NO.** Congress and its members are *de jure* officers. The constitutional command to reapportion within three years of a census is mandatory, but failure to comply does not dissolve Congress or render it illegal. The Constitution implies that Congress continues to function with existing districts until a valid reapportionment is made. Furthermore, under the *de facto* doctrine, the acts of officers holding office under color of title are valid insofar as the public is concerned to prevent chaos.

3. **YES.** The use of the word "or" in Article XV ("may propose amendments... or call a convention") is not exclusive and may mean "and." There is no prohibition against exercising both powers, provided the separate requirements for each are met.

4. **YES.** Article XV states amendments shall be valid when approved at "an election," without qualification. It does not strictly require a "special election." While a special election might be preferred for focused discussion, the Constitution does not prohibit submission during a general election.

5. **NO.** (Petition denied). While six (6) Justices believed R.A. 4913 violated the spirit of the Constitution by failing to provide sufficient time and means for the people to intelligently study the amendments (rendering the submission improper), this fell short of the eight (8) votes required to declare a law unconstitutional. The minority view, which prevailed by default, held that R.A. 4913's provisions for publication and posting were sufficient to meet the constitutional requirement of "submission."

Accordingly, the petitions are DISMISSED.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
*   **Makalintal, J. (Concurring):** R.A. 4913 is sufficient intrinsically. Constitutional validity should not depend on extraneous factors like the "zeal" of implementation or public attention span.
*   **Bengzon, J.P., J. (Concurring):** Concurred with the Chief Justice. Due process requires fair opportunity to be informed, which the law provides; it does not guarantee that voters will actually avail of it.
*   **Sanchez, J. (Dissenting):** Voted to declare R.A. 4913 unconstitutional. "Submission" implies a fair presentation allowing for intelligent consent or rejection. The measures in R.A. 4913 (Official Gazette publication, limited posting) are woefully inadequate to inform the masses, especially when drowned out by the noise of a general election.
*   **Reyes, J.B.L., J. (Concurring with Sanchez):** The amendments should be submitted in a special election to ensure the people's undivided attention.
*   **Fernando, J. (Concurring):** Agreed with the Chief Justice on jurisdiction.
