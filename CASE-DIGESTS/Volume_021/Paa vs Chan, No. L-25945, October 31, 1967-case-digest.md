**I. CAPTION**
NORBERTO B. PAA v. QUINTIN CHAN, G.R. No. L-25945, October 31, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

**II. FACTS**
In the 1963 general elections, respondent Quintin Chan was elected councilor of San Fernando, La Union. Petitioner Norberto B. Paa, a defeated candidate, filed a petition for *quo warranto* questioning Chan’s eligibility on the ground that he is a Chinese citizen.

The records showed that Chan registered as a Chinese citizen with the Bureau of Immigration in 1946 (ACR No. 90215) and reported yearly until 1949. His parents were also registered as Chinese citizens. In 1948, Chan filed a petition for naturalization alleging he was a Chinese citizen, though he later withdrew it claiming to be Filipino. Chan claimed Filipino citizenship arguing that his father, Leoncio Chan, was the illegitimate son of a Chinese father and a Filipino mother, and was therefore Filipino. To prove this, he presented his father’s baptismal and marriage certificates and a 1954 Department of Justice opinion declaring him a Filipino.

The Court of First Instance of La Union ruled that Chan is a Chinese citizen and ineligible for office. Chan appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N respondent Quintin Chan is a Filipino citizen.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision declaring the respondent a Chinese citizen.

The Court held that the opinion of the Secretary of Justice does not have a controlling effect on the Judiciary. The affidavits executed by Chan's parents are inadmissible as hearsay because the affiants were not presented as witnesses. Furthermore, baptismal and marriage certificates are evidence only of the administration of the sacraments on the dates specified, but not of the veracity of the statements therein regarding kinsfolk or citizenship (citing *Adriano v. De Jesus*).

The exercise of rights granted to Filipinos, such as voting or holding a passport, is not conclusive proof of citizenship, as these can be enjoyed through misrepresentation. The Court noted that Chan’s acts—registering as an alien in 1941 and 1946, and filing a naturalization petition under oath declaring himself Chinese—weighed heavily against his claim.

Finally, even assuming Chan’s father was Filipino, Chan was born out of wedlock in 1917, four years before his parents married in 1921. Under Article 121 of the old Civil Code, legitimation by subsequent marriage requires acknowledgment by the parents. The record was devoid of evidence showing Chan was acknowledged; hence, he could not claim citizenship as a legitimate child of a Filipino father.

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
