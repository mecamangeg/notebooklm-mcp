I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO CORRECT ENTRY IN THE LOCAL CIVIL REGISTRY. SINCIO C. YU v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20752, November 25, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Sincio C. Yu sought to correct his birth entry in the Local Civil Registry of Manila [1]. Born on May 16, 1937, to Chinese parents Yu Cho Koo and Tiu Oh Yek, his birth was erroneously registered under the name "Sincio Yee" due to a mistake by the assisting midwife [2, 3]. He sought to change the entry to "Sencio Yu" [1]. The Republic opposed the petition, arguing the change was substantial and not a clerical error under Article 412 of the Civil Code [3]. While the Solicitor General eventually withdrew objection to the surname correction ("Yee" to "Yu"), the Court of First Instance of Manila denied the request to change the first name from "Sincio" to "Sencio," ruling it was a substantial change of name that must be secured through a different proceeding [1, 4]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the change of the petitioner's name from "Sincio" to "Sencio" constitutes a clerical error correctible under Article 412 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that changing "Sincio" to "Sencio" involves merely the substitution of the vowel "i" with "e," which amounts to the righting of a clerical error [5]. Citing *Ansaldo v. Republic* and *Barillo v. Republic*, the Court explained that errors correctible under Article 412 of the Civil Code are "harmless and innocuous changes, such as correction of a name that is clearly misspelled" [6]. A clerical error is defined as one made "in copying or writing" [5]. The decision appealed from was reversed and set aside, and the petition was granted allowing the petitioner to use the name "SENCIO YU" and ordering the Local Civil Registrar to correct the entry accordingly [7].
