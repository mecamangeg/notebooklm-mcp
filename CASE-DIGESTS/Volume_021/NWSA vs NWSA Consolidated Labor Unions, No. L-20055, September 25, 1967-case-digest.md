I. CAPTION
NATIONAL WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY v. NWSA CONSOLIDATED LABOR UNIONS (now KAISAHAN KAPATIRAN NG MANGGAGAWA AT KAWANI SA NAWASA), G.R. No. L-20055, September 25, 1967, 21 SCRA 203, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Union had a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with petitioner NWSA effective for three years from October 1, 1956 [1]. Prior to its expiration, the Union submitted proposals for renewal, but negotiations failed, leading to strikes in 1959 [2]. The President certified the dispute to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [2]. The Union filed a petition with the CIR demanding, among others, wage increases, commissions, and bonuses [3].

On December 8, 1961, the CIR issued an order granting: (1) an increase of P0.02 per bill collected for bill collectors; (2) continuance of existing benefits, including meal allowance for overtime service; and (3) a Christmas bonus for 1961 [3]. NWSA moved for reconsideration, arguing that commissions were already included in the WAPCO salary standardization, meal allowances were prohibited by a Memorandum Circular, and the bonus was a discretionary act of liberality [4], [5], [6]. The CIR denied the motion, prompting NWSA to appeal to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N bill collectors' commissions are deemed included in the WAPCO salary standardization plan.
2. W/N the grant of meal allowance for overtime service is valid under Memorandum Circular No. 24.
3. W/N the CIR may grant a Christmas bonus on equitable considerations despite the expiration of the CBA.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Commissions are not included in the "previous salary" adjustments under the WAPCO plan [4]. The Court held that commissions do not fall under the categories of "food, lodging, or other thing or service" which may be deducted from salary [7], [8]. Unlike fixed salaries for time-based work, commissions are sums given to compensate bill collectors for the special nature of their work and serve as an incentive to persist in collections [8].

2. **NO.** The continuance of the meal allowance was based on a draft agreement preserving benefits "subject to the provisions of existing law" [5]. Memorandum Circular No. 24 (January 1, 1959) prohibits the payment of meal allowances for overtime service except in meritorious cases [5]. As no justification was shown to treat this as a meritorious exception, the allowance must be excluded [5].

3. **YES.** While a bonus is generally an act of liberality and not demandable as part of wages, it may be granted on equitable considerations [6]. The Court cited *Heacock Co. v. National Labor Union*, noting that the CIR may make such awards to settle disputes [6]. The employees had continuously received Christmas bonuses even under the former Metropolitan Water District and during the pendency of the case in 1960 [9].

**WHEREFORE**, the orders of respondent Court are affirmed except with respect to the grant of meal allowance for overtime service, which is hereby eliminated [10].
