I. CAPTION
JUAN DE BORJA, et al. v. HON. EULOGIO MENCIAS, et al., G.R. No. L-20609, November 29, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Crisanto de Borja is an heir in the intestate estate of Marcelo de Borja and testate estate of Josefa Tangco, which were under judicial administration in Special Proceedings Nos. F-7866 and 1955. A money judgment was rendered against Crisanto in Civil Case No. 2414. Pursuant to a writ of execution issued by the lower court, his rights, interest, and participation in the real properties of said estates were levied upon [1, 2].

The Supreme Court previously rendered a decision allowing the sale of these rights. Crisanto filed a Motion for Reconsideration, contending that the sale of his rights and participation in the estates should only be made *after* orders for distribution in the special proceedings have been issued, and not before [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the indeterminate share or interest of an heir in an estate under judicial administration may be sold at public auction to satisfy a judgment debt prior to the final liquidation and distribution of the estate.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the participation of an heir in an estate under judicial administration, although indeterminable before the final liquidation of the estate, may be attached and sold [4].

While the ordinary execution of property in *custodia legis* is generally prohibited to avoid interference with the court's possession, the sale made by an heir of his share in an inheritance, subject to the result of the pending administration, does not interfere with such administration. Relying on *Gotuaco and Co. v. Register of Deeds of Tayabas* (59 Phil. 756) and *Jacosalem v. Rafols* (73 Phil. 628), the Court held such sales valid, provided it is understood that the sale is not of any definite share in a particular property, but only of what might be adjudicated to the heir upon the final liquidation of the estate [5, 6].

The Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED** [7].
