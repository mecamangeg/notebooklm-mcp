I. CAPTION
NORBERTO ROMUALDEZ, JR., in his capacity as Commissioner of Customs and TEOTIMO A. ROJA, in his capacity as Acting Collector of Customs v. HON. FRANCISCO ARCA, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila and SAN DIEGO FISHERY ENTERPRISES, INC., G.R. No. L-20516, November 15, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
In July 1962, the fishing boat "M/B Rio Grande," owned by respondent San Diego Fishery Enterprises, Inc., was seized by the Bureau of Customs after being caught loaded with untaxed blue-seal cigarettes in the Pasig River, a violation of Section 2530 of the Tariff and Customs Code [1]. San Diego Fishery requested the release of the vessel under bond. While the Acting Collector of Customs initially opined favorably, he eventually denied the petition following a directive from the Office of the Commissioner of Customs to exercise discretion in line with the administration's policy of non-release of seized vessels [2].

San Diego Fishery filed a petition for Certiorari with Preliminary Mandatory Injunction with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila (presided by Judge Arca). The petitioners (Customs officials) opposed, alleging lack of jurisdiction and non-exhaustion of administrative remedies [3]. On October 10, 1962, the CFI issued a writ of preliminary injunction ordering the release of the vessel upon the filing of a bond. The petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied, prompting them to file a Petition for Certiorari with the Supreme Court [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to interfere with property subject to seizure and forfeiture proceedings by the Bureau of Customs.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the Court of First Instance has no jurisdiction. Section 2530 of the Tariff and Customs Code vests the authority to hear and decide seizure and forfeiture cases in the Collector of Customs [6]. The proper appellate procedure is to appeal the Collector's decision to the Commissioner of Customs, then to the Court of Tax Appeals, and finally to the Supreme Court [6].

Although Section 44(c) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 confers original jurisdiction on CFIs for cases involving property valued over ten thousand pesos, the Court held that the Tariff and Customs Code (Republic Act 1937) prevails as it is the later law and based on public policy [6]. Citing *Pacis v. Averia*, the Court reiterated that the legislative intent was to deprive CFIs of authority to intervene in Customs seizure proceedings [6]. Furthermore, the law requires the exhaustion of administrative remedies within the Bureau of Customs before seeking judicial relief, which lies with the Court of Tax Appeals, not the CFI [6, 7].

The petition is granted.
