I. CAPTION
PRISCILO G. INTING v. ZOILA L. CLARIN, G.R. No. L-28206, December 28, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
In the November 12, 1963 general elections for Mayor of Loay, Bohol, respondent Zoila Clarin was declared the winner over petitioner Priscilo Inting by the trial court with a plurality of two votes [1]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed Clarin's victory, increasing her plurality to twenty-six votes [1]. Inting filed a petition for review on certiorari with the Supreme Court, contesting the CA's appreciation of ballots. Specifically, Inting questioned the CA's invalidation of his ballots while validating similarly marked ballots for Clarin, involving: (1) nine ballots from Precinct 3 with initials preceding printed numbers; (2) eleven ballots from Precincts 15, 16, and 21 with initials preceding printed numbers; and (3) eleven ballots from various precincts with letters written over printed words [2-4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the nine ballots for Inting from Precinct 3 containing initials preceding printed numbers are valid.
2. W/N the eleven ballots for Inting from Precincts 15, 16, and 21 containing initials preceding printed numbers are valid.
3. W/N the eleven ballots for Inting containing letters written over printed words are valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court affirmed the invalidation of the nine ballots from Precinct 3. The fact that all nine ballots came from one precinct, combined with the circumstance that initials were written preceding printed numbers corresponding to lines for councilor, "impliedly suggests that the marking was a preconceived pattern designedly placed on the ballot to identify it thereafter" [5].

2. **YES.** The Court declared the eleven ballots from Precincts 15, 16, and 21 valid [3]. The Court applied the principle that "a ballot which has been cast carries the presumption that it reflects the will of the voter, and hence, extreme caution should be observed before it is invalidated," citing *Cacho v. Abad* [3]. Unlike the ballots in Precinct 3, these did not evidence a clear pattern designed for identification.

3. **YES.** The Court declared the eleven ballots with letters written over printed words valid [4]. The Court noted that the CA had validated twenty-seven ballots for Clarin which contained identical marks (letters placed over the printed word of a position). Consistency requires that Inting's ballots with similar markings be treated as valid [4].

**Disposition:** The decision of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED**. After re-computation, Inting garnered 1,794 votes against Clarin's 1,785 votes, resulting in Inting's election by a plurality of nine votes [6, 7].
