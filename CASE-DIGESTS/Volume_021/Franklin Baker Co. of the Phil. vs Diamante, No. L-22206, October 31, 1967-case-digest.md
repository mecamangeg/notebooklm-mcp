I. CAPTION
FRANKLIN BAKER COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FLORENCIO DIAMANTE and THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-22206, October 31, 1967, 128 Phil. 685, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Florencio Diamante, a coconut sheller for petitioner Franklin Baker Company, contracted tuberculosis and was disabled for work in 1959 [1]. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) ordered petitioner to pay weekly compensation for up to 208 weeks [1]. In September 1963, petitioner reported that it had fully paid the compensation for the 208-week period [2]. However, respondent filed a petition to extend the period of compensation, alleging he was still suffering from TB and under treatment by the company physician [2]. The WCC *en banc*, without a formal hearing, issued an order extending the compensation period until the illness was cured, subject to the P4,000 limit [3]. Petitioner moved for reconsideration, arguing the Commission *en banc* lacked original jurisdiction to hear the extension and that the lack of hearing violated due process [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the WCC *en banc* has jurisdiction to act on a petition for extension of the compensation period.
2. W/N the WCC violated due process by granting the extension without a formal hearing.
3. W/N a compensation award that has been satisfied may still be reopened to extend the period beyond 208 weeks.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Upon the abolition of the "Office of the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner" by Reorganization Plan 20-A, its powers were taken over by the WCC [5]. There is no prohibition against the Commission *en banc* or any of its Commissioners acting on a petition for extension [5]. In this case, the petition was assigned to the original deciding Commissioner, with the concurrence of two others, indicating it was a collective ruling [5].

2. **NO.** The petitioner submitted a report admitting that the respondent was still receiving medical treatment provided by the company [6]. Since the employer had paid the initial compensation and continued providing medical aid, the compensability and continued incapacity were incontrovertible [7]. Where the facts are established by the employer's own acts, there is no necessity for a formal hearing, and the Commission did not abuse its discretion [7].

3. **YES.** Under Section 18 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, the Commission is authorized to reopen a case to extend the period of compensation after the original payment period has expired [8]. This power allows for an extension beyond the 208 weeks prescribed in Section 14, provided the total compensation awarded does not exceed the statutory limit of P4,000 [8, 9].

The petition is dismissed, and the decision and order of the Workmen's Compensation Commission are affirmed [10].
