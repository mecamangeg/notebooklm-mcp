**I. CAPTION**
ABDULLAH SANGKI, petitioner, v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF NORTHERN COTABATO, and SALIPADA K. PENDATUN, respondents, G.R. No. L-28359, December 26, 1967, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Abdullah Sangki, the Nacionalista Party (NP) candidate for Governor of Northern Cotabato, along with intervenors running for Vice-Governor and Board Member, sought the rejection of election returns from 18 precincts in Pagalungan and 11 precincts in Pikit. They alleged that the returns were "statistically improbable" under the doctrine established in *Lagumbay v. Climaco*, noting that they received zero votes in these precincts while the respondent, Liberal Party (LP) candidate Salipada K. Pendatun, received all the votes cast. In some precincts, the total registered voters equaled the votes for Pendatun.

The Provincial Board of Canvassers denied the petition to reject the returns, citing a lack of jurisdiction. The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) subsequently declined to review the Board's resolution, holding that its power over canvassers was merely supervisory. Sangki filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the election returns should be rejected based on the doctrine of statistical improbability.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court ruled that the doctrine of statistical improbability does not apply because the factual setting differs significantly from *Lagumbay v. Climaco*. In *Lagumbay*, the returns were rejected because *all* candidates of one party received exactly the same number of votes (equaling the number of registered voters) while *all* candidates of the opposing party received exactly zero.

In this case, while Sangki and his co-petitioners received zero votes, other NP candidates (such as Senatorial candidate Magnolia Antonino) received votes in the disputed precincts [1]. Furthermore, unlike in *Lagumbay* where the zero votes of party inspectors were unexplained, here there were explanations provided (e.g., inspectors were not registered to vote or voted for the opposing candidate) [2]. The Court held that the bare fact that a candidate receives zero votes is not enough to make returns statistically improbable [3]. Consequently, the Board of Canvassers correctly performed its ministerial duty by refusing to reject the returns, as they were not "manifestly fabricated" on their face (*res ipsa loquitur*) [4, 5].

Petition denied.
