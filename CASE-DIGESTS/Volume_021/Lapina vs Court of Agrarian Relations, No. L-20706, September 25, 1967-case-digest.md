I. CAPTION
MARIANO LAPINA v. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS and ESTEBAN CALINISAN, G.R. No. L-20706, September 25, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Esteban Calinisan worked on a one-hectare parcel of land in Bacoor, Cavite, belonging to petitioner Mariano Lapina, producing salt during the 1959-1960 agricultural year [1]. Lapina ejected Calinisan before the start of the following agricultural year [1]. Calinisan filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) seeking reinstatement and damages, alleging he was a tenant dispossessed without lawful cause [2]. Lapina denied the tenancy relationship, claiming Calinisan was merely a "helper-apprentice" learning the trade out of friendship [3].

During the proceedings, Lapina failed to appear at the initial hearing. His counsel’s motions for postponement were denied, and the case was submitted for decision based on Calinisan’s evidence [4, 5]. Although the CAR initially affirmed the denial, it later reopened the case to allow Lapina to present evidence [5]. Ultimately, the CAR rendered a decision finding a tenancy relationship existed and ordering Lapina to reinstate Calinisan and pay damages [6]. Lapina appealed, challenging the CAR's jurisdiction over salt land and claiming a denial of due process [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction over disputes involving saltbeds.
2. W/N petitioner was denied his day in court.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction over the case. Citing the *Camus* case, the Court explained that while salt production might not strictly fit the definition of "cultivation" of plants, Section 46 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act (R.A. No. 1199) and Section 35 of the Agricultural Land Reform Code (R.A. No. 3844) expressly mention "saltbeds." Section 46 classifies lands based on crops and explicitly lists saltbeds, alongside fishponds, as governed by stipulations between parties [8]. This indicates the clear intention of Congress to include saltbeds within the purview of tenancy laws [8, 9].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that Lapina was not denied his day in court. The record conclusively showed that he was given every opportunity to present his side, including the reopening of the case to allow him to present evidence [5, 10]. The Court noted that Lapina tried his best to delay the orderly and speedy disposition of the case [10].

**Petition denied. Decision affirmed.**
