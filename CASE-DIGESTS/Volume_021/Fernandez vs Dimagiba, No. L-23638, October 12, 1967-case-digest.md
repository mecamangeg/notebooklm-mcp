I. CAPTION
DIONISIO FERNANDEZ, EUSEBIO REYES, and LUISA REYES v. ISMAELA DIMAGIBA, G.R. No. L-23638, October 12, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On January 19, 1955, Respondent Ismaela Dimagiba filed a petition for the probate of the 1930 will of the late Benedicta de los Reyes, instituting respondent as the sole heir [1]. Petitioners (heirs intestate) opposed the probate on grounds of forgery, vices of consent, estoppel, and revocation by implied law due to two deeds of conveyance executed by the testatrix in 1943 and 1944 in favor of the respondent [1]. These conveyances were previously annulled by the Supreme Court in 1954 due to undue influence [1, 2].

On June 20, 1958, the CFI found the will genuine and properly executed, admitting it to probate, but deferred resolving the issues of estoppel and revocation [3]. Later, the trial court ruled that the will was not impliedly revoked by the deeds of sale [4]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, holding that the 1958 decree admitting the will to probate had become final for lack of appeal and that no legal revocation occurred [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 1958 decree admitting the will to probate was final and appealable despite the reservation of other issues.
2. W/N the 1930 will was impliedly revoked by the subsequent execution of deeds of conveyance in 1943 and 1944.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A probate decree finally and definitively settles all questions concerning the capacity of the testator and the proper execution and witnessing of the will, irrespective of whether its provisions are valid and enforceable [6]. As such, the probate order is final and appealable under Section 1 of Rule 109, which specifically prescribes that any interested person may appeal an order that "allows or disallows a will" [6]. The petitioners' failure to appeal the 1958 decree rendered it final [6].

2. **NO.** Article 957(2) of the Civil Code, which provides for revocation when the testator alienates the bequeathed property, implies a change of intention [7]. Here, the alienation was made in favor of the legatee herself, rendering a change of intention doubtful [8]. Furthermore, the deeds of sale were annulled due to "moral influence" or undue influence [2, 9]. An alienation made through undue influence does not reflect the testator's real intent and is no different from one made through violence or intimidation; thus, it cannot produce a revocation of the anterior bequest [9, 10].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [11].
