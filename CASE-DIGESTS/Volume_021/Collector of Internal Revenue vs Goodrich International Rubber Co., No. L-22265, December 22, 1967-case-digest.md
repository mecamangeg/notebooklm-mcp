I. CAPTION
COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. GOODRICH INTERNATIONAL RUBBER CO., G.R. No. L-22265, December 22, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed respondent Goodrich International Rubber Co. (Goodrich) for deficiency income taxes for the years 1951 and 1952. The assessments resulted from the CIR's disallowance of deductions claimed by Goodrich for bad debts (P50,455.41 for 1951) and representation expenses (P30,138.88 for 1952) [1, 2]. Goodrich appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). The CTA initially rendered a decision allowing the bad debts but disallowing the representation expenses. However, upon Goodrich's motion for reconsideration, the CTA amended its decision and allowed the deduction for representation expenses as well [2, 3]. The CIR appealed the CTA's amended decision to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the representation expenses are validly deductible from gross income.
2. W/N the alleged bad debts were properly deducted as "actually ascertained to be worthless" within the taxable year.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The claim for representation expenses was rejected because it was supported only by receipts issued by Goodrich's own officers, not by the third-party entities where the expenses were allegedly incurred [3]. The Court held that if the expenses were genuine, receipts would have been issued by the recipients of the payments. The officers' receipts merely attested to their claim of having paid expenses but did not establish actual payment to the entities [3].

2. **PARTIALLY.** The Court ruled that under the tax statute, deducting bad debts requires proof that: (1) the taxpayer actually ascertained the debt to be worthless in the taxable year; and (2) the taxpayer acted in good faith by reasonably investigating the relevant facts [4, 5].

   *   **Rejected Debts:** The Court disallowed the deduction of ten specific debts because Goodrich failed to prove they were actually worthless or that it had reasonable grounds to believe so in 1951 [4, 6]. For several accounts, the debtors made full or partial payments after the write-off, indicating "undue haste" by the taxpayer [5]. For others, mere demand letters were insufficient proof of insolvency [7, 8]. Additionally, Goodrich violated Revenue Regulations No. 2 by failing to attach a statement showing the propriety of the deductions to its return [5].
   *   **Allowed Debts:** The Court allowed deductions for eight specific accounts totaling P22,627.35 [9]. These included debts where suits were filed and writs of execution returned unsatisfied [10], small accounts where collection efforts were futile [11], and accounts where counsel investigated and confirmed the debtors had no assets or had gone out of business [9, 12].

   **Disposition:** The decision appealed from is **MODIFIED**. Respondent’s representation expenses are totally disallowed, and its claim for bad debts is allowed up to the sum of P22,627.35 only.
