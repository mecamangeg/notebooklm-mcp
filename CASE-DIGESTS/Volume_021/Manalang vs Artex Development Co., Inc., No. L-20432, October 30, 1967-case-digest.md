I. CAPTION
JOSE MANALANG, ET AL. v. ARTEX DEVELOPMENT CO., INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-20432, October 30, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Manalang, de Leon, and Lactao were employees of Artex Development Co. and members of the Bagong Buhay Labor Union (BBLU), the exclusive bargaining representative [1, 2]. On March 4, 1960, BBLU and Artex entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) which contained a "closed-shop" provision requiring union membership as a condition of continued employment [3, 4]. In April 1960, petitioners organized a rival union, the Artex Free Workers (FFW) [2, 4]. Consequently, BBLU expelled petitioners for disloyalty and demanded their dismissal pursuant to the closed-shop clause [5, 6]. Artex complied and dismissed them on June 3, 1960 [7].

Petitioners filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP), arguing they were unaware of the closed-shop provision and thus should not be bound by it [4, 8]. The CIR trial judge ruled in favor of petitioners, ordering reinstatement [1]. However, the CIR *en banc* reversed the decision, finding that Artex merely complied with the valid CBA and committed no ULP [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the closed-shop provision in the CBA is valid.
2. W/N the petitioners are bound by the closed-shop provision despite their alleged ignorance of its terms.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that a "closed-shop" is a valid form of union security. A provision for it in a collective bargaining agreement is not a restriction of the right of freedom of association guaranteed by the Constitution [10, 11].

2. **YES.** The Court found that petitioners' knowledge of the agreement could be reasonably inferred from their employment since 1959 and their ability to organize a rival union [12]. Even assuming *arguendo* that they were unaware of the stipulations, they are still bound. A union member employed under an agreement between the union and the employer is bound by its provisions, because the CBA is a "joint and several contract of the members of the union entered into by the union as their agent" [10, 13, 14]. Neither ignorance of nor dissatisfaction with the terms justifies a breach of the agreement [13, 14].

The resolution of the CIR *en banc* is affirmed [15].
