I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, plaintiff-appellee, MANDALUYONG BUS COMPANY, complainant-appellant, vs. SOLOMON LIZARDO Y ALEJANDRO, accused, G.R. No. L-22471, December 11, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Solomon Lizardo was charged with slight physical injuries through reckless imprudence in the Municipal Court of Manila following a traffic collision with a car owned by Mandaluyong Bus Company [1]. He was acquitted of this charge [1]. Lizardo was also charged in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila with damage to property through reckless imprudence arising from the same accident [2]. The CFI initially rendered a decision on August 30, 1962, convicting him [2]. However, on December 3, 1962, the Assistant Fiscal moved to dismiss the case, arguing that under *People v. Silva*, the injuries and damage should have been prosecuted under one information [3]. The trial court granted the motion and set aside the conviction [4]. Mandaluyong Bus Company appealed, arguing that the August 30 decision had already been promulgated and become final, causing the court to lose jurisdiction, and that *Silva* was inapplicable [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court had jurisdiction to set aside its decision of August 30, 1962.
2. W/N the dismissal of the damage to property charge was proper based on the rule against splitting charges.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The trial court retained jurisdiction because the decision had not been promulgated. The Supreme Court found no indubitable proof that the decision was promulgated on September 24, 1962, as alleged by the appellant [5]. A decision in a criminal case may be recalled and replaced by the court prior to its promulgation [6, 7]. The Court applied the presumption of regularity to the actions of the Fiscal and the trial judge, concluding they would not have moved for or granted dismissal if the record showed the decision had already been promulgated [5].

2. **YES.** Citing *People v. Silva*, the Court ruled that a defendant must not be harassed with various prosecutions based on the same act by splitting it into different charges [8]. Since Lizardo had already been tried and acquitted for slight physical injuries arising from the same accident, the subsequent prosecution for damage to property constituted prohibited splitting of charges [8].

**Order affirmed.**
