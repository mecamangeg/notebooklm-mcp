**I. CAPTION**
SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC. v. FRANCISCO MAGNO, G.R. No. L-21879, September 29, 1967, Angeles, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner San Miguel Brewery, Inc. (SMB) is a corporation selling beer and soft drinks in Butuan City [1]. After initially paying taxes under Butuan City Ordinance Nos. 11 and 110, SMB stopped paying and incurred tax delinquencies [2]. Respondent Francisco Magno, the City Treasurer of Butuan, issued a warrant of distraint and levy against SMB's properties pursuant to Ordinance No. 26 to enforce collection [3]. Two delivery trucks were seized [3]. SMB filed a suit for damages against Magno in his *individual capacity* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, alleging the seizure was unauthorized [4]. Magno defended that he acted in the performance of official duty [5]. The CFI dismissed the complaint and ordered SMB to pay Magno damages and attorney's fees [6]. SMB appealed, questioning the validity of Ordinance No. 26 and the award of damages [7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the validity of Ordinance No. 26 can be raised for the first time on appeal.
2. W/N Respondent Magno is personally liable for damages for the seizure of the trucks.
3. W/N Respondent Magno is entitled to moral damages and attorney's fees.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The general rule is that questions of constitutionality must be raised at the earliest opportunity; if not raised in the pleadings or trial court, they cannot be considered on appeal [8, 9]. SMB failed to raise the validity of Ordinance No. 26 in the stipulation of facts or evidence during trial [10]. Furthermore, a municipal ordinance is not subject to collateral attack, and Magno was sued in his individual capacity, making him the wrong party to defend the ordinance's validity [11].

2. **NO.** Magno issued the warrant in his capacity as City Treasurer by virtue of Ordinance No. 26, which empowers the Treasurer to seize personal property of delinquent taxpayers [12, 13]. A public official performing a duty enjoined by law without bad faith cannot be made to answer personally for damages [13].

3. **YES, as to attorney's fees and nominal damages.** The Court set aside the award of moral damages because the mere filing of an unmeritorious complaint does not justify such an award without proof of moral suffering, as it infringes on the right to litigate [14, 15]. However, since Magno was sued in his private capacity for official acts and was forced to employ private counsel, it is just and equitable to award attorney's fees and nominal damages [16, 17].

**Disposition:** The decision appealed from is MODIFIED. The award of P2,000.00 damages to defendant is set aside. Attorney's fees are increased to P2,000.00, and plaintiff is ordered to pay P100.00 as nominal damages. Valid in all other respects [18].
