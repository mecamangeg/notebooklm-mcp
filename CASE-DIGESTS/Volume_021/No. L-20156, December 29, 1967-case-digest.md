I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF MANUEL TO alias MANUEL TOH TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. MANUEL TO alias MANUEL TOH v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20156, December 29, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Manuel To, a single Chinese citizen born in Cotabato and residing in Pasay City since 1955, filed a petition for naturalization on January 6, 1961. He claimed to be an employee of Elite Textile Company with an average annual income of P3,600.00. To support his petition, he presented two character witnesses, Florencio M. Mauleon and William C. Limos, who claimed to have known him since 1951. The Court of First Instance of Rizal admitted him as a citizen. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that the petitioner lacked a lucrative income and that the character witnesses were insufficient.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative income.
2. W/N the character witnesses are competent to attest to petitioner's conduct.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court found that P1,000.00 of the petitioner's alleged P3,600.00 income was a bonus. Citing *Ng v. Republic* and *Pe v. Republic*, the Court held that bonuses cannot be taken into consideration for determining lucrative occupation because they are by nature indefinite and contingent. Consequently, the petitioner's income was only P2,600.00. The Court ruled this amount is not lucrative considering the high standard of living and low purchasing power of money [1].

2. **NO.** The character witnesses admitted that their contact with the petitioner consisted only of isolated meetings for a day or two during vacations. The Court held that such occasional meetings are insufficient to enable witnesses to observe the applicant's behavior, character, and associations during the *entire* period of his residence in the Philippines, as required by Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 473. Witnesses must be in a position to establish that the petitioner conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during the requisite period [2].

The judgment appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DENIED**.
