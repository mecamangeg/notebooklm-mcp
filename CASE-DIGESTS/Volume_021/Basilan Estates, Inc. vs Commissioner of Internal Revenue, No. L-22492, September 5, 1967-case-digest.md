I. CAPTION
BASILAN ESTATES, INC. v. THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-22492, September 5, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Basilan Estates, Inc. filed its income tax returns for 1953 on March 24, 1954. On February 26, 1959, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed petitioner for deficiency income tax and a 25% surtax on unreasonably accumulated profits. Petitioner argued that the assessment had prescribed because it allegedly received the notice after the five-year period expired on March 24, 1959.

The deficiency assessment stemmed from the CIR's disallowance of: (1) depreciation claimed on the reappraised value of assets rather than their acquisition cost; and (2) travelling and miscellaneous expenses unsupported by receipts. Additionally, the CIR imposed a surtax under Section 25 of the Tax Code, finding that petitioner unreasonably accumulated profits of P347,507.01 for 1953 instead of distributing them. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the CIR's assessment *in toto*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR's right to assess deficiency tax has prescribed.
2. W/N depreciation may be computed on the reappraised value of assets rather than acquisition cost.
3. W/N the disallowance of travelling expenses due to lack of receipts was proper.
4. W/N petitioner is liable for the 25% surtax on unreasonably accumulated profits.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 331 of the Tax Code, which requires assessment within five years, an assessment is deemed made when the notice is released, mailed, or sent to the taxpayer, not when it is received. The record showed the notice was released on February 26, 1959, well within the five-year period ending March 24, 1959.

2. **NO.** Depreciation must be determined based on acquisition cost, not reappraised value. Section 30(f)(1) of the Tax Code limits the depreciation allowance to the "capital invested." The law does not authorize the recovery of an amount beyond the invested capital free of income tax, as that would constitute profit rather than mere investment recovery. Deductions are privileges and must be strictly construed.

3. **NO.** Under Section 337 of the Tax Code, taxpayers are required to keep receipts and supporting papers for only five years from the last entry. Since the investigation occurred after this five-year period had lapsed, the petitioner was no longer obliged to preserve the records. Thus, the expenses should be allowed despite the lack of receipts.

4. **YES.** The accumulation was unreasonable. Evidence showed a strong financial position (6:1 asset-liability ratio) and the reversion of previously reserved funds to surplus without immediate plans for use. Furthermore, substantial amounts were withdrawn by stockholders as "personal loans," indicating the funds were not needed for business operations. The exemption under R.A. 1823 could not be applied retroactively to the 1953 taxable year.

Judgment modified. Petitioner is liable for deficiency income tax and the surtax, but allowed deductions for travelling and miscellaneous expenses.
