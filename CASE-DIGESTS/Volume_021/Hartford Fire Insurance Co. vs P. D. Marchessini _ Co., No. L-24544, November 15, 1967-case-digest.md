I. CAPTION
HARTFORD FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY v. P. D. MARCHESSINI & Co. (NEW YORK), INC., et al., G.R. No. L-24544, November 15, 1967, 21 SCRA 860, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Maria M. Sarda consigned 19 bales of drapery remnants shipped from Charleston, South Carolina to Manila. The cargo was transhipped in Hong Kong to the SS "New Teh Hu" and arrived in Manila on October 3, 1963. On October 29, 1963, the vessel discharged the cargo into the custody of the Bureau of Customs, which was operating the arrastre service [1, 2].

The consignee failed to receive the goods. Hartford Fire Insurance Company, as the insurer and subrogee of the consignee, paid the insurance claim of P24,715.00. Hartford then demanded payment from the Bureau of Customs, which refused [2]. Hartford filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila for recovery of the sum against the carriers and the government defendants (Republic of the Philippines, Bureau of Customs, and Customs Arrastre Service) [3].

The government defendants moved to dismiss on the grounds of non-suability and non-compliance with Act 3083 and Commonwealth Act (CA) 327, which require money claims to be filed with the Auditor General. The CFI dismissed the case against the Bureau of Customs, Customs Arrastre Service, and the Republic of the Philippines, ruling they could not be sued without their consent and that the agencies lacked juridical capacity [4]. Hartford appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Republic of the Philippines and its agencies (Bureau of Customs and Customs Arrastre Service) can be sued for the loss of cargo while operating the arrastre service.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the Republic of the Philippines, in operating the arrastre service through its agencies, the Bureau of Customs and the Customs Arrastre Service, does so only as a necessary incident of its prime governmental function of taxation [5, 6]. Such performance, for obvious reasons of public policy, does not amount to a waiver of its immunity from suit [6].

Furthermore, the Court noted that the claim, being a money claim, should have been filed in the Office of the Auditor General in accordance with Act 3083, as amended by CA 327 [7, 8]. The claim was for a fixed amount based on accessible papers and documents, and thus was not unliquidated in nature [7].

The order dismissing the action against the Republic of the Philippines, the Bureau of Customs, and the Customs Arrastre Service is affirmed [9].
