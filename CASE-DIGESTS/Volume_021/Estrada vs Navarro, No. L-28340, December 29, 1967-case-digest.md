I. CAPTION
JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA v. HON. PEDRO C. NAVARRO, BRAULIO STO. DOMINGO and MUNICIPAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF SAN JUAN, RIZAL (G.R. No. L-28340) and JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, BRAULIO STO. DOMINGO and MUNICIPAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF SAN JUAN, RIZAL (G.R. No. L-28374), December 29, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Joseph Ejercito Estrada and respondent Braulio Sto. Domingo were candidates for Mayor of San Juan, Rizal in the November 14, 1967 elections.

In **G.R. No. L-28340**, the Board of Inspectors of Precinct No. 93 resolved (2-1) not to count votes for Estrada under names like "Joseph Ejercito Estrada," "Joseph," or "Estrada," despite a prior court order authorizing his use of the name "Joseph Estrada." Consequently, at least 36 votes were excluded from his tally. Two of the three inspectors filed a petition with the CFI of Rizal to correct the return under Section 154 of the Revised Election Code. The third inspector opposed, denying any error. The CFI dismissed the petition.

In **G.R. No. L-28374**, Estrada petitioned the COMELEC to disregard the return from Precinct No. 94 as "obviously manufactured," citing the *Lagumbay* doctrine. The return indicated only 229 voters actually voted, yet 300 valid ballots were found in the box. However, the Minutes of Voting recorded 299 voters, suggesting the "229" entry in the return was a clerical error.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the election return in Precinct No. 93 can be corrected via summary proceeding under Section 154 of the Revised Election Code.
2. W/N the election return in Precinct No. 94 should be annulled as "obviously manufactured" due to statistical improbability.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that for a correction under Section 154 to prosper, two requisites must concur: (1) there must be an error in the return; and (2) the inspectors must be unanimous in admitting the error and willingness to rectify it [1]. Neither requisite was present. First, the return accurately reflected the tally as read (excluding the disputed votes), so there was no error in the return itself; the alleged error was in the *appreciation* of ballots (refusal to count votes), which cannot be cured by summary correction [2]. Second, there was no unanimity as the third inspector and poll clerk opposed the correction [3].

2. **NO.** A conclusion that a return is manufactured must be approached with extreme caution. The doctrine in *Lagumbay* regarding "inherent improbability" applies only when there is no plausible explanation [4]. Here, the Minutes of Voting showed 299 voters, making it clear that the entry of "229" in the return was a mere clerical error. This plausible explanation, supported by the total votes counted (298 for Mayor), suffices to avoid nullification [4].

Petitions dismissed [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Sanchez, J. (Concurring):** Agreed that the lack of unanimity bars the remedy under Section 154. He noted that the petitioner should have sought immediate recourse from the COMELEC during the counting to enforce the valid appreciation of ballots under his name, rather than relying on a post-election summary correction [6, 7].
