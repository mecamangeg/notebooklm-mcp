I. CAPTION
SILVESTRA GALARPE DE MELGAR v. ADORACION PAGAYON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22731, November 15, 1967, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Basilia Paccial originally owned a parcel of land. On December 6, 1924, she sold it *pacto de retro* to Eladio Palomillo for three years. However, on January 30, 1925, the Court of First Instance of Iloilo rendered judgment in a cadastral case decreeing registration of the lot in favor of Paccial, noting only an encumbrance to Palomillo for the sum of P10.00. Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 27663 was subsequently issued to Paccial.

Years later, on October 7, 1949, Salvador Pagayon (respondents' predecessor-in-interest) purchased the land from Paccial for P2,000.00. The OCT was cancelled, and Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-6904 was issued in Pagayon's name. On April 18, 1950, petitioner Silvestra Galarpe de Melgar acquired whatever rights Palomillo had in the land for P300.00. Melgar argued that Palomillo had already consolidated ownership due to Paccial's failure to repurchase, claiming a better right than Pagayon. The Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Pagayon, upholding the indefeasibility of the Torrens title.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Torrens title issued to the subsequent purchaser (Pagayon) prevails over the petitioner’s claim based on an alleged prior consolidation of ownership under a *pacto de retro* sale.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, ruling in favor of the respondents. The Court held that land registration proceedings under the Land Registration Act (Act 496) are *in rem* and are binding and conclusive upon the whole world [1]. Under Section 38 of the Act, upon the expiration of one year within which a petition for review of the decree of registration may be filed, the decree and the title issued become incontrovertible and can no longer be changed, altered, or modified [1], [2].

The Court emphasized that the Torrens title possesses an absolute and conclusive character [3]. This conclusiveness does not cease when the title is transferred to a successor [3]. In this case, Pagayon was a vendee relying on a Torrens title. The issuance of the certificate of title to Paccial (the original owner) gave rise to the presumption that the repurchase regarding the *pacto de retro* sale had been made or that the ownership was properly adjudicated to her [4], [5]. The petitioner's reliance on *Cabanos v. Register of Deeds* was misplaced, as the objective of the Torrens system—to guarantee the indefeasibility of title—would be defeated if a title could be annulled by prior claims after the lapse of the one-year period, especially when the property has passed to innocent third parties [6].

The petition is **DENIED**, and the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
