I. CAPTION
REYNALDO C. VILLASEÑOR v. HON. MAXIMO ABAÑO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Marinduque and THE PROVINCIAL FISCAL OF MARINDUQUE, G.R. No. L-23599, September 29, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Villaseñor was originally charged with Murder (Criminal Case 2299) in the Court of First Instance of Marinduque and released on a P60,000 property bond, later reduced to P40,000 [1]. Before arraignment, the Provincial Fiscal amended the information to "Direct Assault Upon an Agent of a Person in Authority with Murder," a capital offense [2]. Respondent Judge Abaño cancelled the previous bond and, on September 15, 1964, issued an order fixing a new bond at P60,000 in real property [2]. The order imposed specific conditions: (1) sureties must be "residents of the province of Marinduque actually staying therein," and (2) properties offered must be in the possession and ownership of said residents for five years [2]. Villaseñor filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the amount was excessive and the conditions violated the Constitution and Rules of Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the bail fixed at P60,000 is excessive.
2. W/N the trial court may validly require sureties to be actual residents of the province where the court sits.
3. W/N the requirement that property bonds be owned/possessed for at least five years is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The amount is not excessive. The petitioner is charged with a complex capital offense (Direct Assault with Murder), and the principal factor in fixing bail is the probability of the accused's appearance [4, 5]. The Court affirmed the reasonableness of Department of Justice Circular 47, which recommends bail at P2,000 per year of imprisonment, noting the "aggravated crime climate" and reduced peso value [5]. Given the gravity of the offense, the amount did not constitute an abuse of discretion [6].

2. **YES.** The condition is valid. While Section 9, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court requires sureties to be resident householders "within the Philippines," this is a minimum requirement and does not preclude the court from exercising its inherent power to impose cumulative conditions to ensure the accused's appearance [7]. The Judge justified the local residence requirement to ensure court processes could reach sureties on time, citing the insufficiency of mails [8, 9]. Furthermore, the petitioner failed to aver that this requirement caused him prejudice or that he was unable to secure such sureties [10].

3. **YES.** The condition is valid, with clarification. The requirement was based on DOJ Circular 2 intended to prevent fraud by "spurious landowners" [11, 12]. However, the Supreme Court clarified that this order excludes properties registered under the Torrens system (which are indefeasible) from the five-year possession requirement; the condition applies only to unregistered properties [12].

Petition dismissed [13].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Fernando, J. (Concurring):** Admitted hesitation regarding the P60,000 amount given the petitioner's low salary and the constitutional right to bail [13, 14]. However, he concurred because the bail allowed was a property bond rather than cash, which is less burdensome and removes the "taint of constitutional infirmity" [15].
