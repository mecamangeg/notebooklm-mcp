I. CAPTION
PERFECTO BALASON v. ERNESTO BALIDO, G.R. No. L-25772, November 29, 1967, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On January 12, 1964, barrio elections were held in Concepcion, Batangas, under Republic Act No. 3590 (The Barrio Charter). The Board of Election Tellers proclaimed Ernesto Balido as Barrio Captain with 151 votes, winning by two votes over Perfecto Balason. Balason filed an election protest with the Municipal Court of Batangas, which ruled in his favor and declared him the winner. Balido appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Batangas, which rendered a decision presumably affirming Balason's victory. Balido then appealed to the Supreme Court, assigning errors regarding the CFI's appreciation of specific ballots, arguing that certain ballots were marked, contained names in the wrong spaces, or were unofficial "emergency" ballots.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review the Court of First Instance's decision regarding the appreciation of ballots in a barrio election protest.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that it lacks jurisdiction to review the appeal. Under Section 8 of Republic Act No. 3590 (Barrio Charter), the decision of the Court of First Instance in barrio election disputes "shall be final on questions of fact." The Court determined that the issues raised by Balido—such as whether a number written on a ballot identified the voter, or if a name written was *idem sonans* with a candidate—were purely factual questions regarding the appreciation of ballots. Since the appeal raised no questions of law but only challenged the correctness of the lower court's factual findings, the CFI's decision is final and unreviewable. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed.
