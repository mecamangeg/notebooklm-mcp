I. CAPTION
BONIFACIO GESTOSANI, HOSPICIO CUNANAN, ET AL. v. INSULAR DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, INC. and THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF DAVAO, G.R. No. L-21166, September 15, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Davao to annul Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. TT-9810 issued in the name of respondent Insular Development Company, Inc. covering Lot No. 512-A [1]. Petitioners alleged that the issuance of Decree No. N-79289 in 1960 and the subsequent titles derived from it were fraudulent because a previous decree from 1945 had purportedly been issued but lost [2, 3]. Claiming to be bona fide occupants who cultivated the land since time immemorial, petitioners sought to be declared owners by acquisitive prescription or to have the land declared public domain [1, 3].

Respondent Insular filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds of *lis pendens* (citing Civil Case No. 1503, a pending action for recovery of possession/ownership between the same parties), statute of limitations, and lack of cause of action [4, 5]. The trial court dismissed the petition, ruling that petitioners, as mere occupants without proprietary interest, had no right to bring an action for annulment and that the pending action in Civil Case No. 1503—which declared Insular the absolute owner—was applicable [6]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners have a cause of action to annul the indefeasible title of the respondent.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal. Land registration proceedings under Act 496 are *in rem* and binding upon the whole world [8]. Under Section 38 of Act 496, upon the expiration of one year within which a petition to review the decree of registration may be filed, said decree and the title issued pursuant thereto become incontrovertible and can no longer be changed, altered, or modified [8].

The Court emphasized that to allow the annulment of title after the lapse of the one-year period would defeat the object of the Torrens system, which is to guarantee the indefeasibility of the title, especially when the property has passed into the hands of innocent third parties [8]. The record showed that the registration proceedings were regular, the decision was final, and the ownership of Insular had already been affirmed in the separate Civil Case No. 1503 [5, 9]. Consequently, petitioners' claim of acquisitive prescription or priority rights as occupants cannot stand against the indefeasible title of the respondent [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando, JJ., concurred) [11].
