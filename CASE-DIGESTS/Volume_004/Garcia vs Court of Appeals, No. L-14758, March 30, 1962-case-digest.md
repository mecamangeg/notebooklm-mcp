I. CAPTION
LAUREANO GARCIA v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and SIMEON GARCIA, G.R. No. L-14758, March 30, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Laureano Garcia, a minor, filed a complaint for acknowledgment as a natural child against respondent Simeon Garcia. On December 15, 1956, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cavite rendered judgment in Laureano’s favor. Simeon appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals (CA). While the appeal was pending, Laureano filed a separate action in the CFI of Cavite praying for support *pendente lite*. The CFI granted the motion, ordering Simeon to pay P100.00 monthly [1, 2].

Simeon filed a petition for certiorari with the CA, arguing the order was invalid. The CA granted Simeon's petition and declared the CFI's support order null and void, reasoning that the decision requiring acknowledgment had not yet been affirmed on appeal and paternity was not established by final judgment. Laureano appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may grant support *pendente lite* to an alleged natural child while the decision declaring his acknowledgment is pending appeal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CA and upheld the trial court's order. While the law strictly gives the right of support to *acknowledged* natural children and the judgment of acknowledgment was not yet executory, the Court held that the confirmation of the order of recognition relates back to the date of the original decision [3].

It lies within the discretion of the trial court to direct the father to give support pending appeal where there is at least *prima facie* evidence of the child's right to support [3]. The Court cited *Sanchez v. Zulueta* and *Francisco v. Zandueta*, noting that it would be a "travesty of justice" to refuse support to a minor child based on the lack of a final judgment when *prima facie* evidence exists [3, 4]. The appellate court's order is reversed, and the order granting support *pendente lite* is upheld [5].
