I. CAPTION
THE FIRST NATIONAL CITY BANK OF NEW YORK v. SILVIO CHENG TAN, G.R. No. L-14234, February 28, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On July 2, 1947, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a judgment in a foreclosure case ordering Silvio Cheng Tan and others to pay the First National City Bank of New York (Bank). A deficiency judgment was subsequently rendered on March 25, 1950. After five years elapsed without full satisfaction of the deficiency, the judgment became unenforceable by mere motion. On June 26, 1957, the Bank filed a civil action to revive the judgment.

During the pendency of the revival action, Cheng Tan died. His legal representative moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the Bank should file its claim in the intestate estate proceedings pending in the Court of First Instance of Rizal. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. The Bank appealed, contending that because the judgment had prescribed and was reduced to a "mere right of action," it was not a standard money claim and the revival suit should proceed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action to revive the deficiency judgment should be dismissed and filed as a claim in the probate court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that a deficiency judgment is a contingent claim that must be filed with the probate court where the settlement of the estate is pending.

The Court cited *Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Concepcion e Hijos*, holding that such claims must be presented within the period fixed for filing claims. While the Bank correctly argued that a judgment unsatisfied after five years is reduced to a "mere right of action" (*Cia. General de Tabacos v. Martinez*), this classification likens it to a promissory note. Therefore, like any other actionable debt, it must be submitted as a claim to the probate court under Section 5, Rule 87 (now Rule 86) of the Rules of Court.

Furthermore, reasons of expediency support the dismissal. Even if the revival action were allowed to proceed, the resulting judgment could not be enforced by execution against the deceased but would still have to be enforced through the probate court pursuant to Section 7, Rule 39. Thus, the proper remedy is to file the claim directly in the estate proceedings.

Order affirmed.
