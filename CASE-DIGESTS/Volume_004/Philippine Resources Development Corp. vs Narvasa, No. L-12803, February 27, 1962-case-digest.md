I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION v. THE HON. JUDGE GREGORIO S. NARVASA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-12803, February 27, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Woodward & Dickerson, Inc. filed a complaint for damages against Philippine Resources Development Corporation (petitioner) in the Court of First Instance of Manila [1]. The trial court rendered a decision ordering petitioner to pay approximately $35,328.83 and attorney's fees [2]. Within the 30-day reglementary period, petitioner filed its notice of appeal, appeal bond, and record on appeal with the trial court [3]. Petitioner served copies of the notice and record on appeal to the adverse party but overlooked serving a copy of the appeal bond [3]. Upon plaintiff's motion, the trial court dismissed the appeal for failure to serve the copy of the appeal bond and granted execution pending appeal [4]. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari alleging grave abuse of discretion [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed for failure to serve a copy of the appeal bond on the adverse party.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that while Section 3, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court requires the appellant to serve copies of the notice of appeal, appeal bond, and record on appeal upon the adverse party [4], the petitioner's failure to serve a copy of the appeal bond did not impair the substantial rights of the plaintiff [5]. The bond was filed with the court within the reglementary period, and its sufficiency was never questioned by the plaintiff [6]. Citing *Villanueva v. Fernandez*, the Court ruled that non-compliance with service requirements that does not impair the adverse party's rights should not be a ground for dismissal, and the court's discretion should be tempered with the interest of justice [6]. It would be unfair to defeat the appeal on a mere technicality given the substantial amount involved in the judgment [6].

The petition was GRANTED, and the trial court was ordered to give due course to the petitioner's appeal [7].
