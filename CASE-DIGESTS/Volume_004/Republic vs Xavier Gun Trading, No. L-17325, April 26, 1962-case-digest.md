I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. XAVIER GUN TRADING and LUZON SURETY CO., INC. / REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. TOMAS DOREGO, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-17325 & L-16594, April 26, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
This decision consolidates two cases involving tax deficiencies guaranteed by surety bonds.
1.  **In *Republic v. Xavier Gun Trading*:** Xavier Gun Trading failed to pay sales and fixed taxes for 1948 and 1950. To guarantee payment, Xavier (principal) and Luzon Surety Co. (surety) executed two bonds in June 1952, promising to pay the Republic within six months. They failed to pay. On May 23, 1958, the Republic sued for the forfeiture of the bonds. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila ruled in favor of the Republic. The defendants appealed, arguing the action had prescribed under the 5-year limit of the Tax Code [1-5].
2.  **In *Republic v. Dorego*:** Tomas Dorego executed a bond in June 1951 to guarantee percentage taxes, promising monthly installments. He paid only the first installment. The Republic filed a collection suit on March 25, 1959. The CFI of Iloilo dismissed the complaint, ruling that the action to collect the principal tax obligation had prescribed (5 years), and thus the accessory bond obligation was also extinguished [6-8]. The Republic appealed.

The common defense was that the actions were for the collection of taxes barred by Section 332(c) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the government’s action to enforce the surety bonds is barred by the 5-year prescriptive period for collection of taxes under the National Internal Revenue Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the actions are not merely for the collection of taxes but for the enforcement of written contractual obligations.

Upon the execution of a bond to guarantee the payment of internal revenue taxes, the taxpayer and the surety assume a new obligation entirely distinct from the original tax liability. This new liability is voluntary and contractual [10]. Therefore, the applicable provision is **Article 1144 of the Civil Code**, which states that actions upon a written contract must be brought within **10 years** from the time the right of action accrues [11, 12]. Section 332(c) of the NIRC, which limits the collection of taxes to 5 years, is not applicable to actions for the forfeiture of bonds [12]. Furthermore, the bond serves as a written acknowledgment of the debt, which interrupts the prescriptive period for the payment of the tax [13]. Since the actions in both cases were filed within 10 years from the execution of the bonds, the government's right to recover has not prescribed.

Judgment in G.R. No. L-17325 is **AFFIRMED**; the Order of dismissal in G.R. No. L-16594 is **REVERSED** and the case is remanded for further proceedings [14].
