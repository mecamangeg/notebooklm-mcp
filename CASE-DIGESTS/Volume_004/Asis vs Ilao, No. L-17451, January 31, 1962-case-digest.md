I. CAPTION
DOMINADOR S. ASIS v. HON. MELQUIADES G. ILAO, BASILIO ZANTUA, and FERNANDO V. PAJARILLO, G.R. No. L-17451, January 31, 1962, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
In a pending election protest involving petitioner Dominador Asis and respondent Fernando Pajarillo, respondent Judge Melquiades Ilao of the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Norte issued an order appointing Deputy Clerk of Court Basilio Zantua as Commissioner to receive evidence [1]. Judge Ilao justified the appointment by citing the massive volume of work—specifically 199 ballot boxes in the instant case and numerous boxes in other pending protests—noting that hearing the evidence personally would occupy the court for a year and stall other cases [2].

Asis filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the Election Law and Rules of Court did not authorize such an appointment. He contended that under Rule 34 of the Rules of Court, a reference to a commissioner without the parties' consent is only valid for the examination of "long accounts" or specific questions of fact, none of which applied here [3, 4]. The Judge denied the motion, clarifying that the Commissioner was strictly limited to marking and receiving ballots objected to by the parties and was not authorized to receive parol evidence or appreciate the ballots [5, 6]. Asis filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has the authority to appoint a commissioner to mark and receive ballots objected to in an election protest without the parties' consent.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the authority to appoint a commissioner for this purpose is derived directly from **Section 175 of the Revised Election Code** [6, 8]. This section authorizes the court, upon petition or *motu proprio*, to order the production of election documents and "to appoint such officers as it may deem necessary" for the purpose of examination and recounting of votes [9, 10].

The Court distinguished between two types of evidence in election cases: (1) documents required to be produced under Section 175 (e.g., ballots), and (2) evidence *aliunde* [11, 12]. The Commissioner's duty was confined to the first type—specifically marking ballots for identification to prepare for the court's examination. He was not authorized to receive parol evidence or evaluate the ballots [6]. Therefore, the limitations of **Rule 34 of the Rules of Court** regarding references to commissioners were inapplicable. Furthermore, **Rule 132** establishes that judicial rules apply to election cases only by analogy or in a suppletory character [12, 13]. The summary nature of election contests, which involve public interest, justifies brushing aside technicalities to expedite the determination of the people's choice [13].

Petition dismissed [11].
