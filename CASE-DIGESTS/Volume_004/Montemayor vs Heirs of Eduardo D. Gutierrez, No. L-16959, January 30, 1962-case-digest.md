I. CAPTION
INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED CLODUALDO VITUG, DONATA MONTEMAYOR, administratrix-appellant, vs. HEIRS OF EDUARDO D. GUTIERREZ, heirs-appellees, G.R. No. L-16959, January 30, 1962, Labrador, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Donata Montemayor served as the administratrix of the estate of her late husband, Clodualdo Vitug [3]. Atty. Eduardo D. Gutierrez served as counsel for the estate from June 1936 to December 1953, handling cases filed against the administratrix and heirs regarding real properties [4]. A project of partition had been approved as early as 1933, and the remaining unpartitioned personal properties were lost or destroyed during World War II [4]. Following Atty. Gutierrez's death, his heirs sought payment for his services. The Court of Appeals declared the administratrix liable for P9,600.00 in attorney's fees [2, 5]. In executing this judgment, the Court of First Instance of Pampanga ordered Montemayor to pay the sum personally, with a right to reimbursement from the heirs of her deceased bondsmen [2]. Montemayor appealed, contending she should not be personally liable as she held no estate funds and committed no malfeasance [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the administratrix is personally liable for attorney's fees incurred by the estate when there are no funds left and she committed no malfeasance. [6]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The expenses of administration must be borne out of the properties under administration or the income derived therefrom [7]. An administrator can be held personally responsible only for malfeasance, maladministration, or violation of duties, none of which were present in this case [6, 7]. It is unfair to make the administratrix personally liable for counsel fees for services rendered to her in her official capacity [7, 8]. Furthermore, the surety on an administration bond is bound only for faithful administration and not for money spent in good faith [9].

Under Rule 89, Sections 5 and 6 of the Rules of Court, where heirs have entered into possession of portions of the estate before debts and expenses have been paid, they become liable to contribute to the payment of such obligations [10]. Since the heirs received their shares, they must be responsible for the expenses proportionately [8]. The order appealed from is set aside, and the fees payable to the estate of Atty. Gutierrez are ordered to be apportioned among the heirs [9].
