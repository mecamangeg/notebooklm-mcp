I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. TIMOTEO CRUZ and FELIPE DE LA CRUZ, G.R. No. L-15369, April 26, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On August 9, 1955, at about 4:00 a.m., Manuel Valencia was haggling for fruit on Azcarraga Street, Manila, when he was shot from behind and killed. Eliseo Cruz, who was with the victim, saw appellant Felipe de la Cruz standing behind Valencia with a drawn pistol immediately after the shot. Felipe attempted to shoot Eliseo, but his gun jammed. A second shot rang out, and Eliseo saw appellant Timoteo Cruz standing nearby on the railroad tracks with a drawn gun. Felipe and another man fled by boarding a car waiting nearby, identified as belonging to Timoteo. The Court of First Instance of Manila convicted both appellants of murder and sentenced them to life imprisonment. Appellants appealed, raising the defense of alibi.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over positive identification.
2. W/N conspiracy existed between the appellants.
3. W/N the killing was qualified by treachery.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The defense of alibi is not tenable in the face of positive identification by disinterested witnesses. The Court ruled that the testimony of the accused regarding their whereabouts could not prevail over the positive identification by prosecution witnesses (Eliseo Cruz, Sgt. Redolfin, and bus employees) who had no motive to falsely impute such a grave crime [1, 2].

2. **YES.** Although there was no direct proof of conspiracy, the simultaneous presence of both appellants at the scene, the shot fired by Timoteo immediately after the victim was shot by Felipe, and the fact that Felipe immediately boarded Timoteo's car which was ready for the getaway, left no room for doubt as to the existence of unity of action and purpose between them [3-5].

3. **YES.** The crime committed is murder qualified by treachery. The victim was fired upon from behind without any warning, which insured the execution of the crime without any risk arising from any defense the victim might make [3, 4, 6].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [7].
