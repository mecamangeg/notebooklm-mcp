I. CAPTION
**TOMAS B. TADEO v. THE PROVINCIAL FISCAL OF PANGASINAN, THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE OF MANGALDAN, EMILIA ACOSTA and LEONCIO MAICONG**, G.R. No. L-16474, January 31, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents-spouses Maicong and Acosta filed a civil action for damages (Civil Case No. 10759) and a criminal complaint for *estafa* (Crim. Case No. 129) against Petitioner Tadeo, a lawyer and notary public. They alleged Tadeo fraudulently induced them to sign a deed of sale conveying land to a third party, while they believed it was a deed of partition [1, 2]. The CFI dismissed the civil case due to the spouses' lack of interest, and the Justice of the Peace (JP) consequently dismissed the *estafa* case without prejudice [2, 3].

Tadeo subsequently filed a complaint for declaratory relief (Civil Case No. D-413) to declare the deed of sale genuine [3]. The spouses then refiled the *estafa* charge (Crim. Case No. 263) based on the same facts [3, 4]. When the Provincial Fiscal and JP proceeded with the preliminary investigation for the new criminal case, Tadeo filed a petition for prohibition, claiming the previous dismissals barred prosecution and that his pending declaratory relief suit was prejudicial [4]. The CFI denied the writ, ruling that the Fiscal had authority to investigate and Tadeo had other remedies [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Provincial Fiscal and Justice of the Peace committed grave abuse of discretion in conducting the preliminary investigation for *estafa* despite the previous dismissals and the pending declaratory relief case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's denial of the writ of prohibition. The Court held that a Provincial Fiscal or Justice of the Peace has the clear power and authority to conduct preliminary investigations of crimes committed within their territorial jurisdiction [6, 7].

The Court reasoned that the previous civil case was dismissed for lack of interest, not on the merits of the alleged fraud, and the prior *estafa* case was dismissed without prejudice, thus not barring the new prosecution [7]. Furthermore, Tadeo's reliance on the pending declaratory relief action was misplaced; as a notary public who merely acknowledged the execution of the deed and was not a contracting party, he was not entitled to file an action for declaratory judgment regarding the document [7-9]. Finally, the extraordinary remedy of prohibition was improper because Tadeo had a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, where he could raise his defenses and appeal in the criminal proceedings [10].

The order appealed from is affirmed [11].
