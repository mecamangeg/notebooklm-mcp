I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FILEMON CUTURA, G.R. No. L-12702, March 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
In December 1944, during a benefit dance in Dimiao, Bohol, Jesus Cimafranca had an altercation with guerilla officers Lt. Parilla and Lt. Cuevas, defying their authority and firing his gun [1]. On December 13, 1944, Lt. Cuevas ordered his men to apprehend Cimafranca. Upon capture, Cimafranca was brought to headquarters with his hands hogtied [2]. Lt. Cuevas admonished him, stating he would "pay for what he did." Immediately after, Cutura and other soldiers assaulted the helpless victim. Cutura struck Cimafranca on the head with a big piece of wood, contributing to his fall and subsequent death [2].

The Court of First Instance of Bohol convicted Cutura of murder, appreciating the mitigating circumstance of obfuscation, and sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty [3]. Cutura appealed to the Court of Appeals. The CA found no evidence to support obfuscation, which would raise the penalty to *reclusion perpetua* (falling under Supreme Court jurisdiction), and certified the case to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the testimony of discharged co-defendants turned state witnesses is credible.
2. W/N the accused is criminally liable for the victim's death despite the alleged absence of conspiracy.
3. W/N the accused can invoke Amnesty Proclamation No. 8.
4. W/N the mitigating circumstance of obfuscation should be appreciated.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that while the testimony of discharged co-accused should be taken with caution, it cannot be nullified if it is credible and corroborated by other eyewitnesses [5]. In this case, the testimony was corroborated by independent witnesses who were present and knew the appellant [6].

2. **YES.** Even in the absence of conspiracy, the accused is responsible. The Court found that Cutura's blow with the piece of wood contributed to and accelerated the victim's death [7]. It is not necessary that each separate injury be fatal in itself; it is sufficient if they cooperated in bringing about the death, citing *U.S. v. Rodriguez* and *U.S. v. Abiog* [7].

3. **NO.** The benefits of Amnesty Proclamation No. 8 cannot be invoked because the aggression was a result of personal strife arising from the earlier altercation, not due to the deceased's activities inimical to the resistance movement [8].

4. **NO.** The record is barren of evidence supporting obfuscation. The victim was hogtied and helpless; the assault was induced by the lieutenant's admonition rather than a lawful impulse or passion on the part of the accused [9]. Consequently, the proper penalty under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code is *reclusion perpetua*.

**Disposition:** The decision is MODIFIED. The accused is sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*, and affirmed in all other respects [9], [10].
