I. CAPTION
APOLONIO DE LOS SANTOS v. BENJAMIN V. LIMBAGA, G.R. No. L-15976, January 31, 1962, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
On November 19, 1952, Apolonio de los Santos applied for a permit with the City Engineer of Basilan City, Benjamin Limbaga, to construct a residential house on his land in Lamitan. Limbaga refused to grant the permit [1]. The refusal was based on the fact that, following a fire that razed the local market, the City Council had approved a resolution to expropriate the area, including De los Santos's lot, to enlarge the market site [1]. De los Santos filed a petition for mandamus with a claim for damages. The trial court dismissed the petition, ruling that the issuance of the permit was not a ministerial duty but required sound discretion, and that De los Santos had effectively abandoned his application by constructing a temporary store on the same site under a different name during the pendency of the case [2]. De los Santos appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N mandamus lies to compel the City Engineer to issue the building permit.
2. W/N the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Mandamus will not lie to compel the City Engineer to approve an application for the construction of buildings when the land in question is already the subject matter of expropriation proceedings instituted by the City pursuant to a resolution by the City Council. The Court found that expropriation proceedings were indeed pending in the Court of First Instance of Basilan [3].

2. **YES.** The petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial intervention. Under Commonwealth Act No. 424, the Director of Public Works exercises supervision and control over city engineers. De los Santos should have appealed the City Engineer's decision to the Director of Public Works, and subsequently to the Secretary of Public Works and Communications if necessary (*Miguel v. Reyes*). The principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies rests on the presumption that the administrative agency, if afforded a complete chance to pass upon the matter, will decide the same correctly (*De la Torre v. Trinidad*; *Perez v. City Mayor*) [3].

The Order of the trial court is **AFFIRMED** [4].
