I. CAPTION
ALEJANDRO FACUNDO v. HON. JAVIER PABALAN, LEONARDO CARBONELL, and VICENTE PEREZ (G.R. No. L-17746); VALERIANO ULEP v. LEONARDO CARBONELL, ET AL. (G.R. No. L-17807), January 31, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Alejandro Facundo (Market Collector, a civil service eligible) and Valeriano Ulep (Local Civil Registry Clerk, a non-eligible) were employees of the Municipality of Asingan, Pangasinan. On June 24, 1960, the Municipal Council passed Resolution No. 67 abolishing their positions citing "excess of personnel" and economy. On the same day, Resolution No. 70 was passed creating four positions for policemen. Mayor Carbonell subsequently terminated their services.

Facundo and Ulep filed a petition for Mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan. The CFI rendered a decision on September 28, 1960: (1) Upholding the abolition of Ulep's position because he was non-eligible; but (2) Declaring the abolition of Facundo's position illegal as he was eligible and removed without cause, ordering his reinstatement with back salaries.

Respondents failed to appeal Facundo's reinstatement within the reglementary period, making that portion of the judgment final. Facundo moved for execution, but Judge Pabalan denied it, reasoning that the decision was "indivisible" and Ulep had appealed his case to the Supreme Court. Facundo filed a petition for certiorari with mandamus (G.R. No. L-17746) to compel execution. Meanwhile, Ulep appealed the validity of his position's abolition (G.R. No. L-17807).

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial judge may be compelled by mandamus to issue a writ of execution for the judgment in favor of Facundo.
2. W/N the abolition of Ulep's position by the Municipal Council was valid.

IV. RULING
**1. YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that once a decision becomes final and executory, the prevailing party is entitled to execution as a matter of right, and it becomes the court's ministerial duty to issue the writ (Sec. 1, Rule 39, Rules of Court). The Court rejected Judge Pabalan's view that the decision was indivisible. Although contained in one document, the decision made separate findings and distinct rulings for Facundo and Ulep based on their different qualifications (eligible vs. non-eligible). Consequently, Ulep's appeal had no bearing on Facundo's final judgment.

**2. YES.** The Court held that the power to create an office includes the power to abolish it, unless restricted by law (*Castillo v. Pajo*). The abolition must be made in good faith. Here, the Council’s stated reasons—excess personnel and the ability to transfer duties to the internal revenue clerk—were deemed valid. The subsequent creation of policeman positions did not indicate bad faith as the duties were entirely different. Since Ulep was a non-eligible holding a temporary appointment under Sec. 682 of the Revised Administrative Code, he could not claim security of tenure against a valid abolition of his office.

**Disposition:** In G.R. No. L-17746, the order denying execution is **SET ASIDE** and the writ is ordered issued. In G.R. No. L-17807, the decision validating the abolition of Ulep's position is **AFFIRMED**.
