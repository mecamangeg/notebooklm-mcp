I. CAPTION
POMPOSA VDA. DE NATOR and ALFREDO TALON v. THE HON. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, DIONISIO ABENAZA, GAUDENCIO CARDONA, QUINTIN BRIONES, ALFREDO COMPRA and LUCIO COMPRA, G.R. No. L-16671, March 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Abenaza et al., former hotel boys of "La Suerte Hotel" owned by petitioners Nator and Talon, filed a complaint for underpayment, overtime pay, and separation pay against petitioners in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu on August 6, 1953 [1]. The CFI ruled in favor of respondents. Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA). Due to a fire destroying the stenographic notes, the CA remanded the case to the CFI for retrial on February 24, 1958 [1], [2]. Upon remand, the CFI dismissed the case on August 30, 1958, declaring it lacked jurisdiction over Minimum Wage Law cases, citing *PAFLU v. Tan*, and ruling that jurisdiction belonged to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [2], [3].

Respondents then filed their claim with the CIR on December 5, 1958 [4]. Petitioners moved to dismiss on grounds of prescription (citing the 3-year limit under the Minimum Wage Law and Eight-Hour Labor Law) and res judicata (citing the CFI dismissal and a denied petition for mandamus regarding that dismissal) [5], [6]. The CIR decision is now before the Supreme Court on review [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondents' action has prescribed.
2. W/N the action is barred by prior judgment (res judicata).

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The action has not prescribed. While the Minimum Wage Law and Eight-Hour Labor Law generally provide a three-year prescriptive period, the filing of the action in the CFI on August 6, 1953, interrupted the running of the prescriptive period pursuant to Article 1155 of the New Civil Code [7]. The interruption lasted until the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction became final on August 30, 1958 [8]. The time during which the case was pending cannot be counted toward prescription; thus, the filing in the CIR on December 5, 1958, was timely [8]. The Court emphasized that respondents were diligent and filed their claim in the court which had jurisdiction at the time under existing jurisprudence [9], [7].

2. **NO.** The action is not barred by prior judgment. The elements of res judicata are: (1) finality; (2) competence of the court; (3) judgment on the merits; and (4) identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action [10]. The CFI's dismissal was based on lack of jurisdiction, and the Supreme Court's subsequent dismissal of the mandamus petition was based on the remedy being an appeal, not the merits of the case [10]. Consequently, there was no judgment on the merits to serve as a bar [10].

**Disposition:** However, applying the doctrine in *Naric Workers' Union v. CIR*, since the employer-employee relationship had ceased and no reinstatement was sought, jurisdiction lies with the regular courts [11]. The case is **REMANDED** to the CFI of Cebu to conduct the hearing for retaking lost testimonies as originally ordered by the Court of Appeals [12].
