I. CAPTION
PAULINA ANTONIO, ET AL. v. CEFERINO NATIVIDAD, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14631, March 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Ceferino Natividad filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) against his grandparents, petitioners Spouses Raymundo Ruz and Paulina Antonio, alleging he was their tenant and was illegally replaced by Angeles Natividad [1]. The petitioners denied the tenancy relationship, arguing that Ceferino was an intruder against whom they had already secured a judgment for ejectment in the Justice of the Peace Court [2]. In that ejectment case, Ceferino filed a written answer but did not allege that he was a tenant [3]. The CAR, proceeding ex-parte after petitioners failed to appear, ruled in favor of Ceferino and ordered his reinstatement [2, 4]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that no tenancy relationship existed and thus the CAR lacked jurisdiction [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a tenancy relationship existed between the petitioners and the respondent.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CAR decision, finding that the lower court's conclusion was not supported by substantial evidence [6]. The Court noted that Ceferino's testimony regarding an oral agreement failed to establish the specific conditions under which he was allegedly taken as a tenant [3]. While witnesses confirmed he entered the land, they did not prove he did so as a tenant [7]. Crucially, when previously sued for ejectment in the Justice of the Peace Court, Ceferino merely denied the allegations and failed to claim tenancy in his written answer [3, 8]. The Court observed that he only filed the agrarian action after losing the ejectment case in an attempt to remove the dispute from the jurisdiction of the regular courts [8]. As the existence of tenancy was not proven, the CAR lacked jurisdiction. The decision was reversed and the case dismissed [6].
