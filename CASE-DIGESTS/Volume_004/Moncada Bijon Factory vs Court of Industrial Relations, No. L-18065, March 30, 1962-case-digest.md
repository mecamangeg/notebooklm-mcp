I. CAPTION
MONCADA BIJON FACTORY and/or LAO OH KIM, Yu GUAT and SOTERO BERNAL vs. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and MONCADA UNITED WORKERS UNION, G.R. No. L-18065, March 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Lao Oh Kim owned the Moncada Bijon Factory in Tarlac. In 1953, the respondent Moncada United Workers Union filed an overtime claim against him. On July 10, 1956, Lao Oh Kim gathered the workers and asked them to resign from the Union, forego overtime claims, and revert to longer working hours. The Union members rejected this request [1].

Four days later, the factory suspended operations. On July 25, 1956, Lao Oh Kim executed a deed purporting to sell the factory to Yu Guat, his former agent. When operations resumed on August 6, 1956, Union members were refused readmission, while workers who had resigned from the Union were accepted back. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) gave credence to the Union's evidence that the sale was simulated to remove recalcitrant employees and found the petitioners guilty of unfair labor practices (ULP) [1, 2]. Petitioners appealed via certiorari.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court may review the CIR's factual finding that the sale was simulated.
2. W/N the finding of ULP is inconsistent with the CIR's finding that the rival union (Rising Labor Union) was not company-dominated.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the conclusion reached by the lower court regarding the simulated nature of the sale is a question of fact. Because this conclusion was supported by competent evidence—specifically the circumstances of the workers' refusal to leave the Union followed by the alleged sale and subsequent discrimination—it is beyond the Supreme Court's power of review on appeal by certiorari [2, 3].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that no inconsistency exists between a finding of ULP and a finding that a rival union is not company-dominated. An employer can still discriminate in favor of a union (or against another), which constitutes unfair labor practice, even if the favored union is not dominated by the company [2].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [4].
