I. CAPTION
VICENTE FRAGANTE v. PEOPLE'S HOMESITE & HOUSING CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-16020, January 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Vicente Fragante, the General Manager and Acting Chairman of the People's Homesite & Housing Corporation (PHHC), was suspended by the President of the Philippines on charges of irregularity. The suspension order was served on him approximately 35 minutes before midnight on April 4, 1954, just before his 65th birthday, which is the age of automatic and compulsory retirement. Due to the pending charges, action on his retirement was suspended. Over two years later, on August 17, 1956, the President exonerated Fragante. Fragante then demanded payment of back salaries for the period of his suspension and other retirement privileges. The PHHC refused, leading Fragante to file a suit in the Court of First Instance of Quezon City. The lower court dismissed his complaint, and he appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the suspension order served minutes before the mandatory retirement age extended Fragante's government service.
2. W/N Fragante is entitled to back salaries for the period of suspension following his exoneration.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that under Section 12(c) of Commonwealth Act No. 186, as amended, retirement is "automatic and compulsory" at age 65 for employees with 15 years of service. The only legal basis to extend service beyond this age is a "specific approval" by the President based on special qualifications and the need for the employee's services. The Court ruled that a suspension order is the negation of a "specific approval" to continue in office; it implies an intent to stop the employee's service, not extend it for normal duties [1-3].

2. **NO.** Since Fragante was automatically retired on his 65th birthday (April 5, 1954), he was no longer a government employee during the suspension period that followed. Therefore, his subsequent exoneration could not entitle him to back salaries for a period when he was already deemed retired by operation of law. The Court distinguished this from the ruling in *Naric v. Naric Workers' Union*, noting that reinstatement and back wages apply only when the exonerated employee has not yet reached the mandatory retirement age [4, 5].

Decision affirmed.
