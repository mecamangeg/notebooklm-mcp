I. CAPTION
COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. ALBERTO M. K. JAMIR, G.R. No. L-16552, March 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Alberto M. K. Jamir declared a net income of P17,774.15 in his 1954 income tax return. The Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed a deficiency income tax and a 50% surcharge, alleging an undeclared income of P31,274.91. The CIR utilized the "expenditures method," calculating that Jamir’s expenses for the months of February and May 1954 exceeded his reported income for those specific months. Jamir appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), explaining that the excess amounts represented advances from customers which were recorded in his books in subsequent months. The CTA reduced the liability, ruling that the expenditures method should be applied to the full year, not monthly. The CIR appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the "expenditures method" should be applied on a monthly basis to determine the existence of undeclared income.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the "expenditures method" of determining income should be applied by deducting the aggregate *yearly* expenditures from the declared *yearly* income, not the expenditures incurred each *month* from the declared income therefor [1, 2]. In this case, Jamir's total income for the year 1954 exceeded his total claimed deductions [2]. Furthermore, the Court found Jamir’s explanation regarding customer advances satisfactory, negating the existence of the alleged undeclared income [2]. Consequently, the 50% surcharge for alleged fraud was also properly eliminated [3].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [4].
