I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ANTONIO ALBERT, G.R. No. L-12996, January 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
The Republic of the Philippines sought to collect deficiency tax, surcharges, and interest from defendant-appellant Antonio Albert [1]. The trial court ruled in favor of the Republic, finding that the tax assessment had become final and executory [2]. Albert appealed the decision directly to the Supreme Court on pure questions of law [2]. Following the Supreme Court's decision promulgated on December 28, 1961, Albert filed a Motion for Reconsideration, contending that he was not barred from contesting the assessment because there was no evidence he received the Bureau of Internal Revenue's letter dated June 21, 1955 [1]. Albert had failed to allege in his answer in the lower court that the assessment had not become final [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appellant can question the finality of the tax assessment for the first time on appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court denied the motion and held that the trial court's finding that an assessment had become final and uncontestable cannot be reviewed on appeal when the appeal is taken directly to the Supreme Court on pure questions of law [2]. In such appeals, the lower court's findings of fact are binding. Furthermore, the appellant failed to allege in his answer in the lower court that the assessment had not become final, effectively barring him from raising this factual issue for the first time on appeal [2].

Motion denied [3].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, and De Leon concurred in the denial. Chief Justice Bengzon took no part [4].
