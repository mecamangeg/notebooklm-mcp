I. CAPTION
ADELAIDA TABOTABO, ET AL. v. AGUEDO TABOTABO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-10909, April 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Gaudencio Tabotabo died in 1908, leaving a will. In the probate proceedings (Sp. Proc. No. 256), the petitioners—children of Gaudencio's alleged natural son, Vicente Tabotabo—filed a motion claiming to be the sole heirs based on an alleged acknowledgment of Vicente in Gaudencio's will [1, 2]. On September 10, 1909, the probate court denied their claim, ruling that Vicente was not acknowledged in the will and that the testator actually intended to disinherit him [2, 3]. The petitioners did not appeal this order, and the proceedings were closed in 1910 [4]. The properties were subsequently possessed by Gaudencio's widow and later the defendants [4, 5]. Nearly 50 years later, in 1955, the petitioners filed a new complaint for partition and accounting [5]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint on the grounds of lack of cause of action, *res judicata*, and prescription [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Vicente Tabotabo was validly acknowledged as a natural child under the Old Civil Code.
2. W/N the action is barred by *res judicata* and prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Article 131 of the Old Civil Code, a voluntary acknowledgment in a will is generally self-executing [6]. However, Article 133 of the same Code provides that an adult natural child cannot be acknowledged without his consent [7, 8]. The record showed that Vicente Tabotabo was already of age (having ten children) at the time of the alleged acknowledgment, yet there was no evidence he consented to it [7, 8]. Consequently, he was not validly acknowledged and had no successional rights, rendering the petitioners strangers to the estate [7, 9].

2. **YES.** The specific issue of Vicente's status was squarely resolved by the probate court in 1909 in Sp. Proc. No. 256, which ruled adversely against the petitioners [9]. Since no appeal was taken, that order became final, constituting *res judicata* [3, 9]. Furthermore, the defendants had been in possession of the properties since 1908/1910, while the complaint was filed only in 1955; thus, the action is also barred by the statute of limitations [10].

Appeal dismissed and order affirmed [11].
