I. CAPTION
TERESA REALTY, INC. v. JOSE SISON, G.R. No. L-14716, April 23, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Jose Sison was a lessee of a residential lot owned by Petitioner Teresa Realty, Inc. in Manila. The 25-year lease contract expired on December 31, 1953 [1]. Prior to expiration, Teresa Realty notified Sison to vacate or pay an increased monthly rental of P133.30 (12% of the assessed value). Sison refused to pay the increase or vacate [2].

Teresa Realty filed an unlawful detainer case in the Municipal Court of Manila, which ruled in its favor. Sison appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI), invoking Republic Act (R.A.) No. 1162, which provided for the expropriation of landed estates and suspension of ejectment proceedings. The CFI ordered Sison to vacate and pay the increased rent [3, 4].

On appeal to the Court of Appeals, Sison moved to suspend proceedings under R.A. No. 1599 (amending R.A. No. 1162), approved on June 17, 1956. The CA certified the case to the Supreme Court regarding the applicability and constitutionality of the suspension law [4]. A commissioner's report revealed the lot was an "unofficial subdivision lot" not for sale [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the ejectment proceedings should be suspended under Republic Act No. 1599.
2. W/N the lease contract was extended by the lessee's offer to pay reasonable rent.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The suspension of ejectment proceedings under Section 5 of R.A. No. 1162, as amended by R.A. No. 1599, is expressly limited to a period of **two years** from the date of approval of the amendatory act (June 17, 1956) [6, 7]. This period had already expired by the time the Court resolved the matter. The Court reasoned that to allow an indefinite suspension dependent solely on the Government's non-action in instituting expropriation would deprive landowners of their property without due process of law [7, 8].

2. **NO.** The lease contract expired on December 31, 1953 and was not extended [8]. The mere fact that a lessee is willing to pay what he claims to be a reasonable rent—which is less than that demanded by the lessor—does not operate to extend the lease contract [8, 9]. Furthermore, the Court found the rent demanded by Teresa Realty (P133.30) to be reasonable as it represented only 12% of the property's assessed value [10].

The appealed judgment is **AFFIRMED** [11].
