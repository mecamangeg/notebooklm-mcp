I. CAPTION
ANUNCIACION CANDELARIO, on her behalf, and as the legal guardian of the minors AGUSTINA MATUTE CANDELARIO, ELENA MATUTE CANDELARIO, ET AL. v. HON. ANTONIO CAÑIZARES, PATERNO R. CANLAS and JOSE L. MATIAS, G.R. No. L-17688, March 30, 1962, Labrador, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioners, heirs to the testate estate of Amadeo Matute Olave, hired respondent lawyers Canlas and Matias, agreeing to pay them 10% of their inherited shares as attorney's fees [3]. In July 1958, the probate court ordered a P40,000 advance payment to the lawyers [4]. However, in December 1958, the BIR assessed the estate's value at approximately P2.48 million, much lower than expected [5]. Petitioners filed a motion in September 1959 to stop further payments, alleging that the P88,710 already paid to the lawyers exceeded the agreed 10% based on the BIR assessment [5]. The lower court denied the motion and disallowed the appeal, ruling that the July 1958 order for advances was final and executory [6, 7]. Subsequently, the court granted Atty. Canlas' motion to record a charging lien of P201,300 against the estate, ignoring petitioners' opposition that the fees were already fully paid [8, 9]. Petitioners filed this action for mandamus (to compel appeal) and certiorari (against the lien) [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the probate court retains jurisdiction to modify an order fixing attorney's fees during the pendency of the proceedings despite the order being partially executed.
2. W/N the lower court abused its discretion in recording an attorney's charging lien without ascertaining if the fees had already been paid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The probate court retains control and jurisdiction over incidents connected with special proceedings, including orders regarding attorney's fees, until the case is closed [10]. Citing *Tambunting de Tengco v. San Jose*, the Court ruled that an order fixing fees is not final and immutable; the court may modify, increase, or decrease the fees as new facts unfold—such as a lower estate valuation—even if the fees have been partially or fully paid [10]. The lower court erred in treating the 1958 order as final and refusing to admit evidence of the estate's actual value [11].

2. **YES.** The lower court abused its discretion in ordering the annotation of the charging lien without holding a trial to determine the veracity of petitioners' claim that the fees had already been fully paid [12]. It would be unjust and illegal to create a charging lien if the obligation has arguably been satisfied [13].

The orders requiring payment of the balance of advances and the registration of the charging lien were **SET ASIDE**, and the case was **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings to determine if the fees were fully paid [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
