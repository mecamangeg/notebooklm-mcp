I. CAPTION
REMEDIOS QUIOGUE, ET AL. v. JACINTO BAUTISTA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-13159, February 28, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs filed an action to foreclose two deeds of mortgage executed by defendants to secure two loans: P2,000.00 (obtained May 9, 1944) and P6,000.00 (obtained October 11, 1944). Both deeds stipulated that the loans could not be repaid "within one year from the date of the termination of the last world war." Defendants moved to dismiss, arguing: (1) the action was premature because the war had not legally ended until the ratification of the Japanese Peace Treaty in July 1956; (2) the action was barred by a prior judgment (Civil Case No. 11969) where plaintiffs had already foreclosed a *first* mortgage on the same properties; and (3) payment should be adjusted under the Ballantyne Scale. The trial court ruled in favor of plaintiffs, ordering the payment of P12,829.81 or the foreclosure of the properties. Defendants appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action was premature based on the date of the "termination of the war."
2. W/N the action is barred by the prior judgment (splitting of a cause of action).
3. W/N the obligation should be paid according to the Ballantyne scale of values.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** In the legal sense, the war formally ended in the Philippines when U.S. President Harry S. Truman officially issued a proclamation of peace on December 31, 1946. Even assuming the intention was to wait for a formal treaty, the Treaty of Peace with Japan was signed on September 8, 1951. The argument regarding the deposit of the instrument of ratification on July 23, 1956, was deemed moot.

2. **NO.** The rule against splitting a single cause of action (Section 3, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court) does not apply because the previous case (Civil Case No. 11969) involved a different transaction—the first mortgage. The present case involves separate transactions (the second and third mortgages). While a single contract/loan embraces only one cause of action that cannot be split into separate suits for collection and foreclosure, separate loans constitute distinct causes of action.

3. **NO.** The Court applied the settled rule that where an obligation incurred during the Japanese occupation is made payable after a fixed period, with maturity falling after liberation, the debtor must pay "peso for peso" in Philippine currency. The Ballantyne Scale is inapplicable in such cases because the currency at the time of maturity is the standard. The Court cited *Aguilar v. Miranda* and *Roño v. Gomez* in support of this doctrine.

Decision affirmed.
