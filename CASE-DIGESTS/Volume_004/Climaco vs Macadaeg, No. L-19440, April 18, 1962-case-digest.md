**I. CAPTION**
CESAR CLIMACO, as Commissioner of Customs, et al. v. THE HONORABLE JUDGE HIGINIO B. MACADAEG and AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS, INC. (consolidated with ADOLFO COLUMBRES, et al. v. HON. HIGINIO B. MACADAEG and AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS, INC.), G.R. Nos. L-19440 & L-19447, April 18, 1962, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
The Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration (ACCFA) faced a crisis involving a surplus of approximately 47 million kilos of low-grade Virginia tobacco and outstanding obligations of P155 million to the Central Bank and farmers [1]. Due to these debts, the Central Bank refused further loans, leaving ACCFA unable to purchase the new local tobacco harvest as required by law [2]. To resolve this, Agro-Industrial Products, Inc. (Agro) proposed to purchase ACCFA's low-grade stock at a ratio of 4 kilos for every 1 kilo of high-grade blending tobacco it would be allowed to import [3].

On July 29, 1961, the President issued a directive approving this proposal to liquidate ACCFA's debts and maintain cigarette production quality [1, 4]. Petitioners (Customs officials and tobacco planters) opposed the importation, arguing it violated Republic Act No. 1194. This law requires that before importation is authorized, ACCFA must certify a shortage of local tobacco only *after* all locally grown Virginia tobacco has been purchased [5]. Petitioners claimed this condition was not met.

Agro filed a case in the Court of First Instance of Manila. Judge Macadaeg issued a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction compelling the release of the imported tobacco [6, 7]. Petitioners sought review, arguing the directive was invalid for non-compliance with the statutory prerequisites.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Presidential directive authorizing the importation of tobacco was valid despite non-compliance with the strict certification requirements of Republic Act No. 1194.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the presidential directive was valid. Although the **strict letter** of Republic Act No. 1194 was not complied with—specifically the requirement that all local harvest be purchased before certifying a shortage—strict compliance was impossible because ACCFA lacked the funds to buy the harvest [2].

The Court ruled that the **spirit of the law** was followed. The directive achieved the law's objectives: preventing dollar drain, providing livelihood to farmers (by generating funds to buy their crops), and maintaining government revenue [2, 8]. The Court applied the principle of **separation of powers**, stating that when discretion is vested in the President and his action satisfies the aims of the law, the Judiciary will not interfere [9, 10]. The Executive's solution to the impasse was consistent with the legislative intent to support the tobacco industry and economy [10].

The petitions were **denied**, and the lower court's order granting the mandatory injunction was **affirmed** [11].
