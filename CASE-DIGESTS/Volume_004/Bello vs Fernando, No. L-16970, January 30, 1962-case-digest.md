I. CAPTION
HON. ELOY B. BELLO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, and EUSEBIO E. FERRER v. VALENTIN A. FERNANDO, G.R. No. L-16970, January 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ferrer filed a civil action for damages against respondent Fernando. The trial court rendered a summary judgment in favor of Ferrer, which Fernando received on April 28, 1959. Twenty-four days later, Fernando filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied. He received the denial on June 24, 1959, leaving him six days to perfect his appeal. On the same day, Fernando filed a notice of appeal and a motion for extension of 30 days to file the record on appeal and appeal bond, citing "heavy pressure of work."

The trial court denied the motion for extension on June 26, 1959. Fernando received this denial on July 1, 1959, one day after his original 30-day period had expired. He eventually filed his record on appeal and bond on July 8, 1959. The trial court disapproved the appeal for being filed out of time. Fernando filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA), alleging grave abuse of discretion. The CA granted the petition and ordered the trial court to give due course to the appeal. Ferrer appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the filing of a motion for extension of time to file the record on appeal and appeal bond suspends the running of the reglementary period for appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision. The Court ruled that the right to appeal is merely a statutory privilege and must be exercised in accordance with the law [1, 2]. Under Section 3, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, the notice of appeal, appeal bond, and record on appeal must be filed within 30 days from notice of judgment. This period is mandatory and jurisdictional [2, 3].

The Court held that the filing of a motion for extension does not suspend the running of the period for appeal [4-6]. The purpose of such a motion is merely to ask the court for an enlargement of time; the movant has no right to assume it will be granted [6]. It was Fernando's duty to verify the outcome of his motion rather than relying on the court to serve the order of denial before the period expired [7]. Furthermore, the excuse of "heavy pressure of work" was rejected, as the 30-day rule already assumes counsel has other cases [8-10]. While courts have discretion to grant extensions, it requires a justifiable reason such as fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence, none of which were present [9, 11].

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED**, and the orders of the trial court disapproving the appeal are **REINSTATED**.
