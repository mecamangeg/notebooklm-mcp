I. CAPTION
THEODORE LEWIN v. THE DEPORTATION BOARD, G.R. No. L-16872, January 31, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Theodore Lewin was charged by Special Prosecutors before the respondent Deportation Board (Case No. R-784) as an undesirable alien for allegedly engaging in illegal foreign exchange, maintaining casinos, and falsifying records regarding a prior conviction [1]. The Board issued a warrant for his arrest, and he was released on bail [1]. Lewin filed motions to quash the charges on grounds of jurisdiction, which the Board and the President of the Philippines denied [2, 3].

Lewin then filed a petition for habeas corpus, certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to stop the deportation proceedings [3]. The CFI dismissed the petition and dissolved the preliminary injunction it had initially issued [4]. Lewin appealed to the Supreme Court. However, records showed that Lewin, who had entered as a temporary visitor, voluntarily left the Philippines upon filing a bond and had not returned [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed for being moot and academic due to the petitioner's departure from the Philippines.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal. The Court held that the petitioner's voluntary departure from the country, his long absence, and his status as a temporary visitor rendered the deportation case academic [6, 7]. Since Lewin was already outside the Philippines and beyond the reach of its legal processes, any decision on the merits would have no practical value or effect [6, 8].

The Court applied the rule that it is not the function of a court to decide moot, speculative, or abstract questions where no practical relief can be granted [9]. Citing *Castro v. Tan*, *Cruz v. Encarnacion*, and *National Labor Union v. Northern Motors, Inc.*, the Court ruled that the issues raised had become moot and of no practical effect [9, 10].

Appeal dismissed [10].
