I. CAPTION
MERCEDES T. CASILAN v. J.C.V. CHAVEZ, QUEZON CITY EXPORT & IMPORT, INC., and EQUITABLE BANKING CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-17334, February 28, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Mercedes T. Casilan filed a collection suit against J.C.V. Chavez and Quezon City Export & Import, Inc. The parties entered into a compromise agreement where Casilan would collect the balance of P4,443.95 from Equitable Banking Corporation (Equitable). The trial court rendered judgment based on this compromise [1]. Equitable moved to amend the decision, arguing it was not a party to the compromise and had not yet collected the funds. The court granted the amendment, making the payment conditional on Equitable's collection of the amount [2, 3]. Casilan’s motion for reconsideration was "denied for lack of merits" [4]. After failing to perfect her appeal on time, Casilan filed a Petition for Relief alleging excusable negligence [5]. The trial court denied this petition, again via a short order stating "Denied for lack of merits" [6]. Casilan appealed to the Supreme Court with a five-page brief, arguing the lower court erred in denying her petition without a hearing and questioning the validity of the short order [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in denying the petition for relief through a brief order stating only "denied for lack of merits."

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order, justifying the use of brief orders due to the heavy volume of court work. The Court held that requiring judges to explain the specific reasons for denying every meritless motion would consume time better spent on important cases [7, 8]. Lawyers are expected to understand the facts and law determinative of their cases; if they do not understand why a petition is denied, it is their failure, not the court's [9]. Furthermore, the Court found Casilan's appellate brief defective because it failed to demonstrate *why* her petition for relief was meritorious or sufficient in substance, merely stating that the lower court erred [10, 11]. The appeal was determined to be an attempt to evade the consequences of failing to perfect the appeal on time [12].

Order affirmed.
