I. CAPTION
J.M. TUASON & CO., INC. v. BIENVENIDO DE LEON, G.R. Nos. L-16668 & L-16669, January 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. filed cases against defendants Bienvenido De Leon and Pedro Panganiban to recover possession of lots in the Sta. Mesa Heights Subdivision, Quezon City, covered by the plaintiff's Transfer Certificate of Title [1]. On August 3, 1959, the Court of First Instance of Rizal rendered judgments ordering the defendants to vacate the premises and pay monthly rentals [1]. Three months later, the defendants filed petitions to set aside the judgments, claiming their failure to attend the July 31, 1959 hearing was due to mistake and excusable negligence [2]. Specifically, they alleged their counsel, Atty. Jeremias Meris, lost his voice due to a severe cold [3]. The motion for postponement was filed on the very day of the scheduled hearing without an attached medical certificate and was not served on the plaintiff [3, 4]. The lower court denied the petitions, prompting the appeal to the Supreme Court [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court erred in denying the petition to set aside the judgment based on the counsel's alleged illness.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's orders [5]. The Court ruled that a motion for postponement based on illness must be supported by a "satisfactory sworn statement, either in the shape of an affidavit or the certificate of a physician," which the defendants failed to provide (*Natividad v. Marquez*) [4]. Furthermore, the records showed the defendants were represented by two sets of lawyers: Atty. Meris and the law firm Asuncion, Bulos, Revilla & Associates [4]. The indisposition of one lawyer did not excuse the failure of the other counsel to appear at the hearing [6]. Finally, the Court noted that the defendants' substantive defenses (adverse possession and nullity of title) were untenable against the plaintiff’s Torrens title derived from an Original Certificate of Title issued in 1914 [6].

The orders appealed from are AFFIRMED [5].
