I. CAPTION
EQUITABLE INSURANCE AND CASUALTY COMPANY, INC. v. RURAL INSURANCE AND SURETY COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-17436, January 31, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On November 11, 1957, Equitable Insurance (plaintiff) and Rural Insurance (defendant) entered into a reciprocal facultative reinsurance agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, Equitable ceded portions of fire insurance risks to Rural regarding stocks owned by Jaen Bermers’ Cooperative Marketing Association and Electric and Lamp Supplies [1]. Both stocks were subsequently burned. Equitable paid the insured parties and sought reimbursement from Rural for its share of the losses, totaling P2,024.87 and P1,334.80, respectively [1, 2]. Rural refused to pay.

Equitable filed a complaint for collection of sum of money. Rural moved to dismiss, arguing that under Article VIII of their agreement, the dispute must first be submitted to arbitration [2, 3]. The trial court denied the motion. The parties subsequently submitted the case for decision based on a stipulation of facts, wherein Rural admitted all allegations in the complaint, including the amounts due, but insisted on the legal defense regarding arbitration and the nature of the obligation [4, 5]. The trial court ruled in favor of Equitable. Rural appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved purely questions of law [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action is premature due to the failure to submit the matter to arbitration.
2. W/N the term "facultative" in the reinsurance agreement entitles Rural to alternative remedies under Article 1206 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The arbitration clause in the Reinsurance Agreement applies only when there is a dispute regarding the meaning of the agreement or the liability of the parties [8]. In the stipulation of facts, Rural admitted the existence of the reinsurance, the occurrence of the fires, its liability as reinsurer, and the correctness of the amounts due [9]. Since there was absolutely no dispute regarding the facts or the amount of liability, there was no necessity to submit the matter to arbitrators or an umpire [9]. Furthermore, the Court cited *Chang v. Assurance Corporation*, noting that a refusal to pay may be deemed a waiver of the arbitration condition precedent [10].

2. **NO.** There is no connection between the reinsurance agreement and Article 1206 of the Civil Code regarding facultative obligations (which allow a debtor to substitute a prestation) [11]. In reinsurance contracts, the term "facultative" merely defines the reinsurer's right to accept or reject participation in a risk [11]. Once the risk is accepted, the obligation becomes absolute and can be discharged in only one way: payment of the share of the losses [11]. There is no alternative or substitute prestation available to the reinsurer [11].

The judgment of the trial court is affirmed [12].
