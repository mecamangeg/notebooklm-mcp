I. CAPTION
TOMAS ALVAREZ and FRANCISCO BASILIO v. BOARD OF LIQUIDATORS, G.R. No. L-14834, January 31, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tomas Alvarez executed a deed of sale with the National Abaca and Other Fibers Corporation (NAFCO) for a lot in the Daliaon Plantation. The Board of Liquidators (BOL), which took over NAFCO's administration, received a protest against the sale. The BOL conducted an investigation. Alvarez and his co-petitioner Francisco Basilio requested to defer the investigation pending a civil ejectment case, but the BOL proceeded ex-parte when they failed to appear.

The BOL found that Alvarez had never possessed the land and was merely acting as a dummy for Basilio, who was disqualified from acquiring the lot because he had already purchased another one. Consequently, the BOL issued Resolution No. 8104 cancelling the sale to Alvarez, forfeiting his payments, and awarding the lot to another claimant. Alvarez filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao to annul the resolution. The CFI ruled in favor of Alvarez, declaring that the BOL lacked the authority to cancel the executed sale and that the ex-parte investigation violated due process. The BOL appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Board of Liquidators has the power to cancel the contract of sale with Alvarez.
2. W/N the Court of First Instance acted correctly in entertaining the direct action for annulment of the Board's resolution.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that under Republic Act No. 477, the Board of Liquidators has the power to dispose of lands under its administration, which includes the right to cancel or give due course to sales contracts or applications. The Court clarified that the "contract of sale" was not an ordinary deed of sale but essentially an application subject to revocation if the applicant failed to meet the necessary qualifications. The investigation established that Alvarez was not in possession and was a mere dummy for a disqualified person; thus, the cancellation was valid and within the Board's statutory authority.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that there is no provision of law authorizing courts to review decisions of the Board of Liquidators through a direct action for annulment. If the Board commits errors or abuse of power, the proper remedy is a special civil action for certiorari or prohibition, alleging lack of jurisdiction or abuse of discretion. Furthermore, the petition was premature because the plaintiffs failed to exhaust available administrative remedies before resorting to the courts.

The decision of the Court of First Instance is **SET ASIDE** and the action is **DISMISSED**.
