I. CAPTION
MACARIO KING, ET AL. v. PEDRO S. HERNAEZ, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-14859, March 31, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Macario King, a naturalized Filipino citizen, acquired a grocery wholesale and retail business ("Import Meat and Produce") on January 1, 1957 [1]. He retained three Chinese employees who were old employees of the previous owner, working as a purchaser and salesmen [1, 2]. King sought permission from the President to retain these employees pursuant to Section 2-A of the Anti-Dummy Law (Commonwealth Act No. 108, as amended), but the request was denied because their positions were not technical in nature [2]. King and the employees filed a petition for declaratory relief, injunction, and mandamus, arguing that the law only prohibits aliens from positions of control and administration, not non-control positions like salesmen [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of King, holding that he may employ aliens in positions not involving management, operation, administration, or control [5]. The Government appealed [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Anti-Dummy Law prohibits the employment of aliens in non-control positions (such as purchasers and salesmen) in a retail establishment.
2. W/N the prohibition against the employment of aliens in retail trade violates the constitutional right to employ or associate.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The employment of aliens in both control and non-control positions in a retail establishment is prohibited by the Anti-Dummy Law [7]. Section 2-A of C.A. No. 108, as amended, prohibits aliens from intervening in the "management, operation, administration or control thereof, whether as an officer, employee or laborer therein" [8, 9]. The Court rejected the "control vs. non-control" distinction, holding that the words "management, operation, administration and control" blended with "officer, employee, or laborer" cover the entire scale of personnel activity [7, 9]. The legislative intent is to close any avenue for unscrupulous aliens to subvert the nationalization of the retail trade by employing aliens who might later act as tools for foreign control [7]. The only exception is for technical personnel authorized by the President [9].

2. **NO.** The nationalization of employment in the retail trade does not violate the Constitution [10]. Relying on *Ichong v. Hernandez*, the Court held that the Retail Trade Nationalization Law and the Anti-Dummy Law are valid exercises of police power aimed at protecting the national economy from alien dominance and control [10, 11]. The right to employ is not absolute, and restricting it to citizens in this context is a valid public policy measure [10]. Furthermore, the Court clarified that the right to employ is distinct from the constitutional right to form associations; the prohibition does not prevent aliens from forming associations for lawful purposes, but regulates business employment to secure national welfare [12].

**Disposition:** Decision reversed. Preliminary injunction lifted. Petition dismissed [13].
