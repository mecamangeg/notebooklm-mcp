I. CAPTION
GONZALO PUYAT & SONS, INC. v. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, G.R. No. L-16843, April 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
The subject land (TCT No. 31423) owned by Ricardo Santos was mortgaged to the Philippine National Bank (PNB) in 1946. In 1957, to satisfy a judgment debt owed to Gonzalo Puyat & Sons, Inc. (Puyat), the land was sold at public auction to Puyat. Puyat's certificate of sale was annotated on the title on August 12, 1957. Subsequently, PNB extrajudicially foreclosed its superior mortgage, purchased the property as the highest bidder, and consolidated ownership. Consequently, TCT No. 31423 was cancelled and a new TCT No. 55826 was issued to PNB. The Register of Deeds did not carry over the annotation of Puyat’s junior lien to the new title. PNB later subdivided and sold the lots to third parties. Puyat filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Rizal (acting as a land registration court) under Section 112 of Act 496 to re-annotate its lien. The lower court granted the petition, ruling the encumbrance was omitted without court authorization. PNB appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Register of Deeds is authorized to issue a new title without carrying over the annotation of subordinate liens upon the foreclosure of a superior mortgage, even without a specific court order.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Upon a proper foreclosure of a first mortgage, all liens subordinate to the mortgage are likewise foreclosed, and the purchaser at public auction acquires title free from the subordinate liens [1]. Ordinarily, unless representation is duly presented to the Register of Deeds that irregularities attended the foreclosure (such as lack of notice to inferior lien holders) at the time of the cancellation of the old title, the Register of Deeds is authorized to issue the new titles without carrying over the annotation of subordinate liens [1, 2].

In this case, no irregularity was brought to the attention of the Register of Deeds when PNB consolidated its title. Therefore, the Register of Deeds acted correctly in not carrying over the inferior lien. Puyat’s remedy to question the legality of the foreclosure or the alleged lack of notice is to file an appropriate ordinary action, as such questions cannot be litigated in a summary proceeding under Section 112 of Act 496 [2].

The order of the lower court is REVERSED [3].
