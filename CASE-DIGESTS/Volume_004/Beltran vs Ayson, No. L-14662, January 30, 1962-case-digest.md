I. CAPTION
**GENOVEVA BELTRAN, ET AL. v. CORAZON AYSON and FABIAN JEMINEZ**, G.R. No. L-14662, January 30, 1962, De Leon, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Macario Beltran died leaving a property covered by Original Certificate of Title No. 51521 [3]. In 1943, his widow, defendant Corazon Ayson, and his half-brother, Jose de la Cruz, executed a deed of extrajudicial partition, declaring themselves the sole heirs and securing Transfer Certificate of Title No. 23235 in their names [3, 4]. The plaintiffs, who are the nephews and nieces of the deceased, were excluded from this settlement and were unaware of the partition until shortly before they filed a complaint for annulment and reconveyance on May 16, 1955 [2-4]. The defendants argued that the action was barred by the statute of limitations [2]. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring them co-owners and ordering reconveyance, prompting the defendants to appeal directly to the Supreme Court [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs' action to annul the extrajudicial partition is barred by the two-year period in Section 4, Rule 74 of the Rules of Court or by the statute of limitations. [6, 7]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the action is not barred. The provision of Section 4, Rule 74, which bars distributees or heirs from objecting to an extrajudicial partition after two years, is applicable only to persons who participated in or had notice of the partition, and only when Section 1 of Rule 74 has been strictly complied with (i.e., all heirs took part in the settlement) [8]. In this case, the plaintiffs did not participate and had no notice of the partition until shortly before filing the case [9].

Furthermore, Section 596 of Act No. 190 is not a statute of limitations against third persons who were not parties to the extrajudicial proceedings [7]. Regarding the four-year prescriptive period for fraud or rescission (under Act No. 190 or Article 1076 of the Old Civil Code), the period is counted from the date the party seeking annulment became aware of the partition [10, 11]. Since the plaintiffs only discovered the partition shortly before filing the complaint in 1955, the four-year period had not yet elapsed [10, 11].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
