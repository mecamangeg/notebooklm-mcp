I. CAPTION
RAMON VELEZ v. GABINO SAAVEDRA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16386, January 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Pelagio Gutierrez filed a complaint for unpaid wages and separation pay against petitioner Ramon Velez with Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor [1]. Hearing Officer Gabino Saavedra and Associate Commissioner P.G. Maliwanag rendered a judgment ordering Velez to pay Gutierrez P1,280.00 and issued a writ of execution [1]. Velez filed a petition for Prohibition with Injunction before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Misamis Occidental, arguing that the Regional Offices and the Labor Standards Commission lacked authority to decide such cases and that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A was unconstitutional [1, 2]. The CFI granted the petition, declaring Reorganization Plan No. 20-A void and permanently enjoining the execution of the judgment [3]. The respondents appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Regional Offices of the Department of Labor have jurisdiction over money claims of laborers under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's ruling, holding that the provision of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, particularly Section 25, which grants regional offices original and exclusive jurisdiction over money claims of laborers, is null and void [5, 6].

Relying on the doctrine in *Corominas v. Labor Standards Commission*, the Court explained that Republic Act No. 997 did not authorize the Government Survey and Reorganization Commission to grant powers to new offices that were not already vested in the Department of Labor [7]. Congress did not intend to transfer jurisdiction from the courts of justice to officials under the Reorganization Plan, as judicial powers are vested only in the Supreme Court and such courts as the law may establish [7]. The Legislature cannot delegate its power to create courts or determine their jurisdiction to another government agency [7].

The Order granting the writ of prohibition and making the injunction permanent is **AFFIRMED** [8].
