I. CAPTION
PAULINO BUGAY v. KAPISANAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA SA MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-13093, February 28, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Paulino Bugay, a union auditor and payroll clerk, was expelled from the respondent Union after he turned over union documents to the company management without consulting union officers. This turnover led management to file a falsification charge against the Union President, which was later dismissed. Bugay subsequently filed an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charge against the Union with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). The CIR ruled his expulsion illegal due to lack of due process and violation of the Union's constitution, ordering his reinstatement. This ruling was affirmed by the Supreme Court in a prior decision.

Following this, Bugay filed a civil action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila for moral damages, alleging mental anguish and social humiliation resulting from the illegal expulsion. The Union filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing the complaint failed to state a cause of action because the previous CIR and Supreme Court decisions did not explicitly find that the charges against Bugay were "trumped up" or fabricated. The CFI sustained the motion and dismissed the complaint. Bugay appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the regular courts have jurisdiction over a claim for moral damages arising from an unfair labor practice.
2. W/N the complaint states a sufficient cause of action for moral damages despite the lack of a specific finding of bad faith or fabrication in the prior ULP decision.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that a claim for moral damages cannot be included in a charge for unfair labor practice filed with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) because such claims do not fall within the jurisdiction of that special court. Therefore, the claim for moral damages is a matter that must be looked into and decided by the regular courts [1-3].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the complaint stated a valid cause of action. Under Article 2217 of the Civil Code, moral damages include mental anguish, social humiliation, and similar injury, and are recoverable if they are the proximate result of a wrongful act [4]. While the previous decisions did not explicitly label the Union's charges as "trumped up" or malicious, the expulsion was unequivocally found to be **illegal** due to serious irregularities, such as the failure to grant Bugay an opportunity to defend himself and the lack of required chapter approval [5]. The Court concluded that this illegal expulsion subjected Bugay to humiliation and mental anguish among the 20,000 union members, entitling him to seek relief [5].

The Order appealed from is set aside, and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [3].
