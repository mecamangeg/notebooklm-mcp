I. CAPTION
R. MARINO CORPUS v. MIGUEL CUADERNO, SR., THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, THE MONETARY BOARD, and MARIO MARCOS, G.R. No. L-17860, March 30, 1962, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner R. Marino Corpus held the position of Special Assistant to the Governor of the Central Bank, a position declared highly technical and in the exempt class [1]. On March 7, 1958, he was administratively charged with dishonesty and misconduct, suspended by the Monetary Board (MB), and investigated by a committee [1]. Although the committee recommended his reinstatement, the MB rejected the report and adopted a resolution considering Corpus "resigned as of the date of his suspension" due to loss of confidence [2]. The MB subsequently appointed respondent Mario Marcos to the position [3].

Corpus filed a petition for certiorari, mandamus, and quo warranto with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [4]. The CFI dismissed the petition on the ground that Corpus failed to exhaust administrative remedies, specifically by failing to appeal to the Civil Service Commission or the President [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition is barred by the failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal, holding that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is not applicable in this case [7, 8].

First, an appeal to the Civil Service Commission would be an act of supererogation, as the Monetary Board had already investigated and decided the matter [9]. Furthermore, since the petitioner belongs to the non-competitive service, such an appeal is merely permissive and voluntary [9].

Second, the petition included a cause of action for *quo warranto* against Mario Marcos [10]. Under Section 16, Rule 68 (now Rule 66) of the Rules of Court, an action for *quo warranto* must be filed within one year from the cause of ouster [11]. The Court cited *Torres vs. Quintos*, ruling that administrative remedies are neither a prerequisite to nor a bar to *quo warranto* proceedings, and their pendency does not suspend the one-year reglementary period [12, 13]. Public interest requires that titles to public office be determined speedily to avoid the government paying two salaries [11].

The Order of the lower court was set aside and the case was remanded for further proceedings [8].
