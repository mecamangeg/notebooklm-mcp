**I. CAPTION**
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PRIMITIVO PINCA @ TIBOY, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-16595, February 28, 1962, Per Curiam.

**II. FACTS**
On October 18, 1958, at about 1:00 A.M. in Gamay, Samar, accused Primitivo Pinca and Pascualito Adora, along with three others, conspired to rob the house of Ambrosio Montallana [1, 2]. Armed with carbines and bolos, Pinca and Adora entered the house through a kitchen hole not intended for entrance [1, 2]. Inside, they shot and hacked to death Ambrosio and two others (Donato Arceno and Gregorio Ortiz), injured a child, and tied up Ambrosio's wife, stealing cash and items worth P5,297.00 [1, 3]. Charged with Robbery in Band with Multiple Homicide and Serious Physical Injuries, the accused pleaded guilty but sought to prove mitigating circumstances of lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong and incomplete self-defense [4, 5]. The Court of First Instance of Samar rejected these defenses, appreciating only the plea of guilty against multiple aggravating circumstances, and sentenced appellants Pinca and Adora to death [6]. The case was elevated on automatic review [7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the imposition of the death penalty was proper given the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the death penalty [8]. The Court ruled that three aggravating circumstances were present, which outnumbered the single mitigating circumstance of the plea of guilty [9].

1.  **Dwelling:** Present because the victims were killed inside their house after the appellants gained entrance through an opening not intended for entrance or egress [10].
2.  **Treachery:** Present because the position of the wounds and bullet holes on the floor revealed the victims were shot in their sleep [11]. The Court held that nightime and abuse of superior strength are generally absorbed in treachery [12].
3.  **Aid of Armed Men:** Present under Art. 14, par. 8 of the Revised Penal Code because at least two of the accused were armed with a carbine and a bolo [9].

The Court rejected the mitigating claims of lack of intent and incomplete self-defense, noting that firing multiple shots and hacking victims negates a lack of intent, and there was no unlawful aggression from the sleeping victims [13].

**Decision affirmed.**
