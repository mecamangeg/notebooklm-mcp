**I. CAPTION**
*In re Petition for Contempt Against Francisco F. Gonzales IV. Hermogenes Concepcion, Jr. v. Francisco F. Gonzales IV*, G.R. No. L-15638, April 26, 1962, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
In connection with Criminal Case No. 47152 (*People v. Secretary Jaime Hernandez*) pending before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, City Fiscal Hermogenes Concepcion, Jr. issued a *subpoena duces tecum* to Francisco F. Gonzales IV, Secretary of Avegon, Inc. The subpoena required Gonzales to appear before the Fiscal and produce various corporate books and financial statements. Gonzales failed to appear. Consequently, the City Fiscal filed a petition for contempt with the CFI. Gonzales argued that the Fiscal lacked the authority to issue a subpoena for a case already pending in court. The CFI ruled against Gonzales, finding him guilty of contempt, fining him P200.00, and ordering him to produce the records. Gonzales appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the City Fiscal has the power to issue a subpoena in a criminal case that is already pending in court.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the City Fiscal's power to issue subpoenas extends only to cases pending investigation before him or his assistants. Once a criminal charge has been investigated and the corresponding complaint or information is filed in court, the investigation ceases to be under the Fiscal's Office and falls under the jurisdiction of the Court. At that stage, the Court has the sole power to issue processes, such as subpoenas, in connection with the case.

The Court likened this to Section 1687 of the Revised Administrative Code regarding provincial fiscals. Since the information had already been filed and there was no request for re-investigation by the accused, the Fiscal had no authority to issue the *subpoena duces tecum*. Furthermore, contempt partakes of the nature of a criminal offense, and doubts regarding the grant of power to issue the subpoena must be resolved in favor of the respondent.

The decision of the lower court is **REVERSED**, and the respondent-appellant is exonerated from the charges of contempt.
