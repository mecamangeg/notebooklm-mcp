I. CAPTION
VALDERRAMA LUMBER MANUFACTURERS' CO., INC. v. CUSI, JR., et al., G.R. No. L-16864, April 18, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
The Court of First Instance of Davao rendered judgment against petitioner Valderrama Lumber Manufacturers' Co., Inc., ordering it to pay P29,683.32 in damages to respondents Ang, Albios, and Chaves [1]. The judgment was based on the petitioner's subsidiary liability as the employer of a driver convicted of homicide and physical injuries involved in a vehicular collision [1, 2]. Upon receipt of the decision on March 30, 1960, respondents immediately filed a motion for execution pending appeal [2]. Judge Cusi granted the motion, reasoning that the petitioner’s appeal would be merely for delay because its defense during trial consisted of a "mere denial" and its evidence "proved nothing" [3, 4]. The Sheriff levied on petitioner’s logs worth P42,000 [3]. Petitioner filed a suit to annul the order, while respondents argued that petitioner should have filed a supersedeas bond under Rule 39, Section 2 to stay the execution [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in granting the execution pending appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that there was no clear abuse of discretion committed by the lower court. The trial court properly exercised its discretion by stating valid reasons for the special order, specifically noting that the evidence presented by the petitioner in the main case did not prove anything, implying the appeal was for delay [4].

However, under Section 2, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, an execution issued before the expiration of the time to appeal may be stayed upon the approval of a sufficient supersedeas bond [5]. As the petitioner alleged it is solvent and capable of filing the bond, the Court ruled it should be allowed to do so [4].

The petition is **DISMISSED**, but the petitioner is granted 10 days from the finality of the decision to file a supersedeas bond; otherwise, the order of execution shall be carried out [6].
