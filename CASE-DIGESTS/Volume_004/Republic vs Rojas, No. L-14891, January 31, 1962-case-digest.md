I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FILADELFO S. ROJAS, G.R. No. L-14891, January 31, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On May 10, 1955, the Republic filed Civil Case No. 26196 against Rojas Express, Inc., Filadelfo Rojas, and Juan Syquia to collect P9,528.00, representing the unpaid second installment of 1947 registration fees for 27 trucks. The complaint alleged that a check issued by the company's manager for these fees was dishonored [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance dismissed this case on August 31, 1955, on the ground of prescription, and the Republic did not appeal [3, 4].

On September 11, 1958, the Republic filed the present action (Civil Case No. 37498) against Filadelfo Rojas to collect the exact same amount for the same unpaid fees on the same trucks [1, 5]. Rojas moved to dismiss on the ground of *res judicata* (bar by prior judgment) [1]. The Republic opposed, arguing that the subject matters differed: the first case was based on the dishonored check (quasi-delict), while the present case was based on the non-payment of registration fees [6, 7]. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and the Republic appealed directly to the Supreme Court [5, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the present action is barred by prior judgment (*res judicata*).

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal. The Court held that the parties, causes of action, and subject matter in both cases are identical [7]. The subject matter of both actions is the collection of unpaid registration fees on the 27 trucks for the second semester of 1947 [7].

The Republic's contention that the first case was based on the dishonored check while the second is on the tax obligation is untenable. The mention of the bouncing check in the first complaint was merely incidental; the basis of the cause of action in both complaints is the fact of non-payment of the registration fees [4]. Neither case could be determined without touching upon the unpaid fees [4, 9]. Since the Republic failed to appeal the dismissal of the first case (Civil Case No. 26196), that judgment became final and serves as a bar to the present action [4].

Order affirmed [10].
