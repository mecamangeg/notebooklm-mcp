I. CAPTION
LEONOR VILLAFLOR VDA. DE VILLANUEVA v. DELFIN N. JUICO, in his capacity as Judicial Administrator of the testate estate of FAUSTA NEPOMUCENO, G.R. No. L-15737, February 28, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Don Nicolas Villaflor executed a will in 1908 bequeathing specific properties to his wife, Fausta Nepomuceno, under Clause 7. The will granted her "*uso y posesion mientras viva y no se case en segundas nupcias*" (use and possession while alive and she does not remarry) [1, 2]. Clause 8 provided that if she remarried, these legacies would pass to the testator's grandniece ("*sobrina nieta*"), petitioner Leonor Villaflor [2].

Nicolas died in 1922 without issue. Fausta received the properties and held them until she died in 1956, never having remarried [3, 4]. Leonor filed an action against Fausta’s estate administrator, Delfin Juico, to recover the properties, arguing she was the reversionary legatee [5]. Juico contended that ownership vested absolutely in the widow because the condition for the reversion (remarriage) never occurred [5]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissed the complaint, ruling that Fausta retained full ownership since she did not remarry [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the widow Fausta acquired full ownership of the properties under the will, barring the grandniece from inheriting them upon the widow's death.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the testator's clear intent was to grant his widow only a usufruct or life tenure, not full ownership.

The Court emphasized the specific phrase used by the testator: "*uso y posesion mientras viva*" (use and possession while alive) [8]. This language distinguishes the bequest from full ownership (*dominio*) and indicates a right limited to the widow's lifetime [8]. The condition regarding non-remarriage was an additional limitation, not the sole condition for the bequest [8].

The lower court erred by interpreting "*uso y posesion*" as ownership and ignoring the phrase "*mientras viva*," thereby violating Article 791 of the Civil Code, which mandates that a will be interpreted to give effect to every expression rather than rendering any inoperative [7, 9]. Citing *In re Estate of Calderon*, the Court reiterated that the testator's clearly expressed intent is the fixed law of interpretation [10]. If the testator had intended to grant ownership subject only to non-remarriage, the phrase "*mientras viva*" would have been superfluous [11]. Thus, upon the widow's death, the properties rightfully passed to the reversionary legatee, Leonor Villaflor [12].

The decision appealed from is reversed, and the appellant Leonor Villaflor Vda. de Villanueva is declared entitled to the ownership and fruits of the properties. [13].
