I. CAPTION
THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE (now Commissioner) vs. ALBERTO D. BENIPAYO, G.R. No. L-13656, January 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Benipayo, owner of the Lucena Theater, was investigated by the BIR for amusement tax liability for the period of August 1952 to September 1953 [1]. An internal revenue agent found that while the ratio of adults to children patrons from 1949 to 1951 was 3:1, the ratio during the period in question reversed to 1:3 [1]. Based solely on this statistical shift, the agent concluded that Benipayo fraudulently sold two tax-free children's tickets to single adults to evade the amusement tax prescribed in Section 260 of the National Internal Revenue Code [1]. The Petitioner assessed a deficiency tax of P12,093.45 [1, 2]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) reversed the assessment, ruling that it was based on mere presumptions rather than factual findings of fraud [2, 3]. The Collector appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the deficiency tax assessment based on the statistical disparity in ticket sales ratios is valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's decision. An assessment fixes a tax liability and must be based on actual facts, not on mere presumptions, no matter how logical they may seem [3, 4]. The presumption of the correctness of an assessment cannot rest on another presumption that conditions in 1949-1951 were the same as those in 1952-1953 [4]. To sustain the deficiency would amount to a finding that the respondent cheated and defrauded the government, which is a serious charge that must be supported by **clear and convincing proof** [4, 5]. Such proof was lacking in this case, as the evidence consisted only of statistical inferences without direct evidence of the alleged fraudulent practice [4, 5].

The appealed judgment is affirmed [6].
