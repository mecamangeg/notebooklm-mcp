**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PASCUAL SILVA, G.R. No. L-15974, January 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
On July 29, 1957, a collision occurred in Meycauayan, Bulacan, between two "La Mallorca" buses, one of which was driven by the accused, Pascual Silva [1]. The accident resulted in the death of Felix Lazaro and physical injuries to several others [1]. On October 25, 1957, an information charging Silva with Slight Physical Injuries thru Reckless Imprudence was filed with the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Meycauayan [1]. On the same day, another information charging him with Homicide with Serious Physical Injuries thru Reckless Imprudence was filed with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan [2].

On November 20, 1958, the JP Court acquitted Silva [1]. Subsequently, Silva moved to quash the information in the CFI on the ground of double jeopardy [2]. The CFI initially denied the motion but, upon reconsideration, dismissed the case on June 26, 1959, citing the doctrine in *People v. Belga* [3]. The State appealed the dismissal, admitting the facts fell under the *Belga* ruling but urging a reexamination of the doctrine [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the acquittal in the JP Court for Slight Physical Injuries thru Reckless Imprudence constitutes a bar to the prosecution for Homicide with Serious Physical Injuries thru Reckless Imprudence in the CFI.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the case. The Court held that the acquittal of the accused in the JP Court constitutes a bar to another prosecution in the CFI based on the same act, consistent with the doctrine of double jeopardy [5, 6].

The Court applied the ruling in *People v. Belga* and *People v. Diaz*, stating that a defendant should not be harassed with various prosecutions based on the same act by splitting the same into various charges [3, 7, 8]. The Court found no merit in the State's request to reexamine the *Belga* doctrine, noting it was clear and had been reiterated in *Yap v. Hon. Lutero* [4]. The prosecution, having chosen to prosecute the lesser offense in the JP Court first, is barred from pressing the more serious charge arising from the same reckless imprudence after an acquittal [9].

**Decision affirmed.**
