I. CAPTION
CALTEX (PHILIPPINES), INC. v. KATIPUNAN LABOR UNION, G.R. No. L-13918, April 25, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
In 1950, a strike by the Katipunan Labor Union against Caltex (Philippines), Inc. was referred to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) as Case No. 430-V. The parties reached a compromise agreement governing dismissals and suspensions, which the CIR approved [1-3].

In 1955, Caltex filed a notice terminating the agreement pursuant to Section 17 of Commonwealth Act No. 103 and subsequently dismissed the union president without notice or investigation [3, 4]. The union filed a petition for reinstatement, which the CIR initially dismissed for lack of jurisdiction [4]. On appeal, the Supreme Court ruled in 1957 that the settlement was a binding contract and remanded the case to the CIR [5, 6].

Instead of raising issues in the remanded CIR case, Caltex filed a separate complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila in 1958 to annul the contract. Caltex alleged that its consent was vitiated by a "mutual mistake" regarding the legal effect of the settlement, claiming they intended it to be terminable under the law rather than a permanent contract [7]. The CFI dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and in deference to the Supreme Court's prior directive [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to annul a compromise agreement approved by the Court of Industrial Relations on the ground of mistake.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the matter falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). Since the compromise agreement was entered into and approved by the CIR in Case No. 430-V, the CIR possesses the authority to nullify it on valid legal grounds [6, 9]. If the labor court has the power to approve the agreement, it logically holds the power to nullify it; thus, there is no need for the company to seek relief in a regular court [9, 10].

Furthermore, the Court noted that the "mistake" invoked by Caltex was a mistake of law—specifically regarding the interpretation of Section 17 of Commonwealth Act No. 103—which cannot serve as a ground for nullification [11].

The Order of the lower court is affirmed [12].
