I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MAXENCIO MORADO**, G.R. No. L-16714, January 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of July 20, 1957, during a benefit dance at a school in Barrio Batuila, Baleno, Masbate, Faustino Laurio (the deceased) was squatting on the lawn outside the building. Maxencio Morado (the accused) suddenly arrived with a bolo and hacked Laurio on the neck, causing his death. The incident was witnessed by Alfredo Esquila, who was leaning on a window sill of the schoolhouse. Another witness, Prepedigno Adrias, saw the event but did not testify in court.

Morado was charged with murder. The Court of First Instance of Masbate convicted him, sentencing him to *reclusión perpetua*. Morado appealed, raising the defense of alibi. He further argued that the trial court erred in giving credence to Esquila because Esquila was not listed in the information and had not executed an affidavit prior to testifying, while the prosecution failed to present the listed witness, Adrias.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the testimony of a witness is admissible if their name was not listed in the complaint and they did not execute a prior affidavit.
2. W/N the prosecution's failure to present a listed witness constitutes suppression of evidence.
3. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over positive identification.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Rules do not make it a condition precedent for a witness to give an affidavit before taking the stand; this procedure is merely to safeguard parties from recalcitrant witnesses [1]. Furthermore, the prosecution is not prevented from placing a witness on the stand even if not listed in the complaint, provided the defense has the opportunity to examine the witness's character and record. The purpose of listing witnesses is to avoid surprise, which was not the case here as the defense had full opportunity to cross-examine Esquila [1].

2. **NO.** The presumption of suppression of evidence is inapplicable where the evidence is at the disposal of both the defense and the prosecution. If the accused believed the listed witness (Adrias) would testify adversely to the prosecution, he was free to present Adrias as his own witness but failed to do so [2], [3].

3. **NO.** The defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive, direct, and straightforward declaration of a truthful witness who swore to having seen the act and the circumstances surrounding the aggression [4], [5]. The Court found Esquila's testimony credible and unbiased [5].

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [6].
