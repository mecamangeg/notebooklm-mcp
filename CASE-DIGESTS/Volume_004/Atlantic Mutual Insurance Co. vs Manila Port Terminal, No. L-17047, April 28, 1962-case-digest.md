I. CAPTION
ATLANTIC MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY v. MANILA PORT TERMINAL and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-17047, April 28, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company (petitioner) insured a shipment of three cartons of medicine from New York consigned to Pfizer Laboratories in Manila. The goods were unloaded at the Port of Manila in good order and turned over to Manila Port Terminal and Manila Railroad Company (respondents), the arrastre operators. Respondents subsequently delivered the shipment to the consignee with shortages and damages amounting to P391.59 [1].

Petitioner sued respondents in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to recover the P391.59 [2]. Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing the amount did not exceed the P2,000.00 jurisdictional threshold [2]. Petitioner opposed, claiming the subject matter was admiralty and maritime commerce, which falls under CFI jurisdiction regardless of amount. The trial court dismissed the case [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the suit for recovery of damages arising after unloading involves admiralty jurisdiction cognizable by the Court of First Instance.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the suit involves no admiralty jurisdiction [3]. The claim was for the recovery of shortages and damages alleged to have arisen *after* the goods had been unloaded at the port [4]. Relying on *Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. vs. Manila Port Service* (G.R. Nos. L-15618 and 16116) and *Delgado Brothers, Inc. vs. Home Insurance Co.* (G.R. No. L-16567), the Court affirmed that such claims against arrastre operators do not fall under admiralty jurisdiction [3]. Since the amount of P391.59 was below the jurisdictional limit of P2,000.00 for the CFI, the dismissal was proper [2].

The appealed order is affirmed [3].
