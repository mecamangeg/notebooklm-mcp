**I. CAPTION**
LAZARO MOSSO v. UY KEE BENG, G.R. No. L-17490, February 27, 1962, Concepcion, J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
Lazaro Mosso filed a claim with the Department of Labor for compensation, separation, and overtime pay for services rendered to Uy Kee Beng Hardware from 1946 to 1956 [3]. While a hearing officer initially dismissed the claim, the Labor Standards Commission Associate Commissioner reversed this, awarding P14,403.16, which was later reduced by the Commission *en banc* to P5,315.54 [3]. The defendant appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, which dismissed Mosso's complaint, giving more credence to the defense's evidence [3]. Mosso appealed to the Supreme Court [3]. In his brief, Mosso argued that the CFI erred in crediting the defendant's evidence, alleging that the daily time records were false and obtained through threats, and that the defense witnesses were unworthy of belief [3, 4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over the case. [4]

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the appellant raised questions of fact, specifically challenging the credibility of the testimony and the daily time records presented by the appellee [4]. The Court noted that issues involving questions of fact and amounts within the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals are beyond the Supreme Court's jurisdiction [4]. Consequently, pursuant to Section 31 of Republic Act No. 296, the case was certified to the Court of Appeals for determination [4].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, and De Leon concurred) [5].
