I. CAPTION
INOCENCIO MIJARES, ET AL. v. JULIAN ADIGUE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14241, February 26, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On January 30, 1957, spouses Inocencio Mijares and Coronacion Ipos filed an action for forcible entry against Julian and Pedro Adigue in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Palanas, Masbate regarding a parcel of land [1]. The JP Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. The defendants appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Masbate [1].

On October 5, 1957, the CFI Judge issued Administrative Order No. 4, referring the case to the *JP Court of Masbate* (the provincial capital) for trial on the merits and judgment, purportedly under Sections 87 and 88 of Republic Act No. 296 (Judiciary Act of 1948) [2]. Plaintiffs moved to return the case to the CFI, arguing that jurisdiction could not be delegated to the JP Court under Section 88 [3]. The JP Court of Masbate denied the motion and, upon plaintiffs' insistence on the jurisdictional error, dismissed the case [3]. Plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has the authority to delegate the trial and disposition of an appealed forcible entry case to the Justice of the Peace Court of the provincial capital.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that under Section 88 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended, the delegation of jurisdiction to Justice of the Peace Courts is strictly limited to *cadastral or land registration cases* where there is no controversy or opposition, or where the value of contested lots does not exceed P5,000 [4]. An action for forcible entry cannot be the subject of such delegation [5]. Additionally, the administrative order effecting the delegation lacked the approval of the Secretary of Justice as required by the statute [5].

The decision was **REVERSED**, and the case was ordered returned to the Court of First Instance of Masbate for trial on the merits [5].
