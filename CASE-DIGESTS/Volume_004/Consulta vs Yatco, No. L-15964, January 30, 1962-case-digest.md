I. CAPTION
EZEQUIEL S. CONSULTA v. HON. NICASIO YATCO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15964, January 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ezequiel S. Consulta was counsel for the executrix in the Intestate Estate of Marcelo de Castro. Respondent Judge Nicasio Yatco issued orders requiring the executrix to explain why she secured a loan from the Development Bank of the Philippines without court authority and why she failed to include certain property income in her accounts. The executrix, through Consulta, filed a "Compliance" and subsequently an "Amended Compliance," arguing the loan was for administration and did not require prior authority. During the hearing on September 12, 1959, opposing counsel remarked that the compliance was defective. When Consulta asked the Judge to specify the particulars of the defect, the Judge replied that Consulta had no right to inquire and declared him guilty of contempt, fining him P20.00. The written contempt order, however, stated the basis for punishment was the failure to submit a satisfactory explanation regarding the loan and accounts, rather than Consulta's behavior during the hearing.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner counsel was validly held in direct contempt of court.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Supreme Court set aside the contempt order. The respondent Judge argued that the petitioner was guilty of direct contempt for his "disrespectful conduct" during the hearing—specifically, for insisting that the "Amended Compliance" was in accordance with court orders despite the Judge's statement to the contrary. The Court ruled that this claim was belied by the contempt order itself, which explicitly described the contemptuous act as the "apparent failure" to submit a satisfactory explanation regarding the client's loan and estate accounts [1]. Since the written order penalized the failure to explain the estate matters—an act pertaining to the client's compliance—and not the lawyer's specific behavior or demeanor, disrespectful conduct was not proven [1]. The Court further noted that for the accounts to be properly settled, the lower court should specify the defects rather than issuing general disapprovals [2]. The order of September 12, 1959, was set aside [3].
