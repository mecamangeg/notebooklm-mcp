I. CAPTION
CANDIDO SAN LUIS v. GREGORIO D. MONTEJO, Adm. Case No. 74, March 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On February 27, 1961, Atty. Candido San Luis filed an administrative complaint against Judge Gregorio D. Montejo of the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga City charging him with serious inefficiency, ignorance of the law, and other irregularities [1]. The investigation highlighted four specific errors committed by the respondent: (1) In Civil Case No. 256, he failed to resolve a motion for bill of particulars for seven months, erroneously believing it could not be resolved until reset for hearing [2, 3]; (2) In *People v. Hadain Sariol*, he convicted the accused of acts of lasciviousness instead of attempted rape, despite a factual finding of an attempt to commit sexual intercourse [4]; (3) In *People v. Yakan Boah Teguto*, he acquitted the accused of rape on the mistaken legal premise that an "attempt is not a crime of rape," despite finding an attempt to "disrupt the virginity" of the victim [5]; and (4) In *People v. Moros Buisan*, he imposed a penalty not prescribed by law [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N respondent Judge is liable for serious inefficiency and ignorance of the law.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the respondent did not observe the care and diligence required of a judge in the performance of his duties [6]. Regarding the delay in Civil Case No. 256, the Court ruled that a motion for bill of particulars need not be set for hearing if unnecessary, and a seven-month inaction is unreasonable [7]. In the criminal cases, the Court found that respondent committed distinct errors in the application of the law, noting that the acquittal in *People v. Yakan Boah Teguto* was a clear miscarriage of justice as the accused should have been convicted of attempted rape [5].

Respondent was **ADMONISHED** to be more careful in the future and **WARNED** that a repetition of similar errors will be the subject of stern disciplinary action [6, 8].
