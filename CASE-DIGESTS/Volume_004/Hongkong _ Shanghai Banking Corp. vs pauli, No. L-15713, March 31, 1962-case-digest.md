I. CAPTION
HONGKONG & SHANGHAI BANKING CORPORATION v. RALPH PAULI, G.R. No. L-15713, March 31, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant-appellant Ralph Pauli obtained a credit line from plaintiff-appellee Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. (HSBC) in 1937. After Pauli failed to pay his initial indebtedness, the parties executed an agreement on January 26, 1938 (Exhibit "A"), where Pauli acknowledged a debt of P220,865.47 [1]. Pauli continued to use the overdraft line, and by December 31, 1941, his debt had increased to P259,125.96 [2].

Pauli made payments on the overdraft line on October 23, 1945, and March 13, 1946 [3]. On March 24, 1955, he executed a written instrument (Exhibit "B") acknowledging that he was still indebted to the bank in the amount of P219,236.20 [4, 5]. On June 14, 1957, HSBC filed a complaint for the collection of the sum [4]. Pauli moved to dismiss on the ground of prescription, arguing the action was barred by the Statute of Limitations [6]. The Court of First Instance of Manila denied the motion and rendered judgment in favor of HSBC, ordering Pauli to pay the debt [7, 8]. Pauli appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for collection of sum of money has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The action has not prescribed. The Court held that under Section 50 of Act 190 (Code of Civil Procedure), which governs prescription running before the effectivity of the New Civil Code (pursuant to Article 1116), payments made on an overdraft line or a written acknowledgment thereof have the effect of renewing the right of action [3].

The Court found that the prescriptive period was renewed by the payments Pauli made on October 23, 1945, and March 13, 1946 [3]. While the period technically began on the date of the last payment (March 13, 1946), the Moratorium Law suspended the institution of the action until July 26, 1948 (effectivity of R.A. No. 342) [9]. Thus, the prescriptive period effectively started running from July 26, 1948 [9]. Furthermore, the period was again renewed when Pauli acknowledged the debt in writing on March 24, 1955 [10, 11]. Since the complaint was filed on June 14, 1957, it was well within the ten-year prescriptive period [11].

Judgment affirmed.
