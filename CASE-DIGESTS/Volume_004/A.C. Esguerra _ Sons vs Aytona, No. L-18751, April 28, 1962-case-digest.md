I. CAPTION
A.C. ESGUERRA & SONS v. DOMINADOR R. AYTONA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18751, April 28, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner A.C. Esguerra & Sons was the operator of warehouses in the Bureau of Customs zone. As their operating contract was expiring, the Secretary of Finance directed the Commissioner of Customs to conduct a public bidding for the operation of said warehouses. Among the bids received were Petitioner's offer of a 35% government share, and A.R. Reyes & Co.'s offer of a 30% government share if gross income was below P35,000, and 55% if above that amount.

The Bidding Committee recommended A.R. Reyes & Co. as the most favorable bidder. The Secretary of Finance approved the recommendation but imposed a condition: the contract must stipulate a flat 55% government share irrespective of gross income, effectively removing the 30% clause. The contract was executed between the Commissioner and A.R. Reyes & Co. Petitioner filed an action for certiorari to annul the award. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila ruled in favor of Petitioner, declaring the award null and void on the ground that the Secretary of Finance exceeded his authority by modifying the terms of the bid. The respondents appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Secretary of Finance exceeded his authority in awarding the contract to A.R. Reyes & Co. with the modified stipulation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the lower court.

The Court held that the modification made by the Secretary of Finance merely eliminated a *surplusage*. Historical data showed that the warehouses' monthly gross income consistently ranged between P90,000 and P110,000, far exceeding the P35,000 threshold. Thus, the 30% rate offered by the winning bidder would never have applied. The stipulation of a flat 55% rate was practically the same as the original bid or acted to the government's advantage, and the winning bidder did not object to it.

Furthermore, the invitation to bid expressly reserved the right of the government to reject any and all bids. The government exercised its discretion in choosing the most advantageous bid. Under well-settled doctrine, a losing bidder has no cause to complain or dispute that choice unless unfairness or injustice is shown (*Ocampo v. Municipal Council*; *Leoquinco v. Postal Savings Bank*). Here, Petitioner's bid (35%) was clearly less favorable than the awardee's (55%), and Petitioner was found to be disqualified due to a violation of bidding instructions regarding relatives.

Decision reversed.
