**I. CAPTION**
GODOFREDO I. MOSUELA, GREGORIO C. MON and HONORIO L. PADILLA v. PHILIPPINE LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE COMPANY, G.R. Nos. L-16693-4-5, January 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners Mosuela, Mon, and Padilla were employees of respondent Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) and members of the Social Security System (SSS). Under the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between PLDT and the employees' union, employees were entitled to sick leave with full pay for the first two weeks of illness, and thereafter, sick leave with half pay for up to six months [1].

In 1958, the petitioners separately fell ill or underwent surgery. After exhausting their two-week sick leave with full pay, they continued to be on leave receiving only half pay in accordance with the CBA [2-4]. They applied for sickness benefits under the Social Security Act (Republic Act No. 1161) for the periods they were receiving half pay. PLDT refused the claims, arguing that under Section 14(a) of the Act, benefits begin only after "all leaves of absence with pay" are exhausted, and interpreted "pay" to include the half pay they were receiving [2, 5, 6]. The Social Security Commission ruled in favor of the petitioners, ordering PLDT to pay the benefits. PLDT appealed [7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N employees receiving half pay during sick leave under a Collective Bargaining Agreement are entitled to sickness benefits under the Social Security Act.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court affirmed the Social Security Commission's resolution.

The Supreme Court held that the Social Security Law was enacted to protect employees against hazards like sickness, and these purposes would be frustrated if lawful claims were denied simply because a claimant receives "infinitesimal" pay from the employer [6]. The statutory requirement to exhaust "all leaves of absence with pay" presumes that if an employee receives the *same* compensation as when healthy, they have no ground for complaint; however, this does not apply when compensation is substantially reduced, as in the case of half pay [6].

Furthermore, the law does not consider contractual allowances when fixing sickness allowances. Contractual sickness benefits cannot reduce statutory indemnities unless the collective bargaining agreement expressly provides for the deduction of statutory allowances from the benefits the employer is obligated to pay [8, 9].

**Resolution affirmed.**
