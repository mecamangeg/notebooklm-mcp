I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, ET AL. v. THE HON. JUDGE JULIO VILLAMOR, ET AL., G.R. No. L-13530, February 28, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Eduardo S. Puzon filed a civil complaint against Petra A. Querubin to declare a deed of sale allegedly executed by him as void. The trial court ruled the deed was fictitious, and Querubin appealed to the Court of Appeals. While the appeal was pending, Puzon filed an information for false testimony against Querubin, alleging she falsely testified that Puzon executed the deed.

During the criminal trial, the prosecution presented evidence to prove the non-existence of the deed and rested its case. When the defense began presenting evidence to prove the deed's existence, the private prosecutor moved to suspend the trial, arguing that the validity of the deed was a prejudicial question pending in the civil appeal. Respondent Judge Villamor denied the motion. Puzon filed a petition for certiorari to enjoin the court from allowing the accused to present evidence on the document.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the criminal trial should be suspended due to a prejudicial question in the pending civil case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that suspending the trial would be "most unfair" to the accused [1]. Since the prosecution had already presented evidence attempting to prove the document was fictitious, the accused cannot be deprived of the opportunity to disprove it and establish her innocence [1].

The Court reasoned that if the prosecution believed the issue was prejudicial, it should not have filed the criminal charge until the Court of Appeals had disposed of the civil case [1]. The filing of the criminal charge immediately after the civil appeal was viewed as a means to cause harassment or prejudice to the accused [2].

Petition is denied and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [2].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Barrera, J. concurs in the result [3].
