**I. CAPTION**
CHUA TAY v. REGIONAL OFFICE 3, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR F. A. FUENTES, HEARING OFFICER PAULINO S. PEREZ, and FELIPE AGUPAN, G.R. No. L-16981, March 30, 1962, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
Felipe Agupan, a former employee of Chua Tay (owner of Acme Furniture), filed a claim for compensation (Case RO3-WC-388) with Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor, alleging he contracted tuberculosis due to his employment [1]. The Hearing Officer ruled in favor of Agupan, ordering Tay to pay disability compensation and expenses [2]. Tay filed a notice controverting the award, but Agupan moved for execution, arguing the notice was merely *pro forma*. The Regional Administrator issued a writ of execution [3].

Tay filed a petition for certiorari in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, questioning the jurisdiction of the Regional Office to adjudicate money claims and the validity of the proceedings [3]. The CFI rendered judgment holding Reorganization Plan 20-A unconstitutional insofar as it vested judicial powers in regional offices, declaring the proceedings null and void [4]. The respondents (Labor Officials and Agupan) appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Regional Office No. 3 has jurisdiction to hear and decide claims under the Workmen's Compensation Act pursuant to Reorganization Plan 20-A.
2. W/N the Regional Office has the authority to issue writs of execution for its awards.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Regional Office has jurisdiction. While the Supreme Court previously ruled in *Corominas* that Reorganization Plan 20-A is unconstitutional for vesting regional offices with jurisdiction over general money claims, this invalidity does not extend to Workmen's Compensation cases [5, 6]. As clarified in *Miller v. Mardo*, the disputed provision merely reallocated or reassigned authority already bestowed on labor officials by Republic Act 997, as amended by R.A. 1241, rather than granting new judicial power [6, 7]. Thus, the Hearing Officer's authority to render judgment was upheld [6].

2. **NO.** The authority to decide compensation claims does not carry with it the authority to issue writs of execution [8, 9]. By specific provision of law, the power to enforce awards in Workmen's Compensation cases is reserved exclusively to the court of record under whose jurisdiction the compensable injury occurred [9]. Furthermore, Tay’s appeal was not *pro forma* and should have been given due course by the Workmen's Compensation Commission [10].

**Disposition:** Decision modified. The authority of the Hearing Officer is upheld, but the writ of execution is set aside, and the appeal is remanded to the Commission [10, 11].
