I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MARIANO TENORIO alias MAGIN, G.R. No. L-15478, March 30, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
In the afternoon of April 4, 1959, a peace rally was held at the tennis court of the plaza in Caoayan, Ilocos Sur. During the event, the accused, Mariano Tenorio, stabbed Atty. Maximino Bello, a former governor, with a 10-inch bolo, causing his death. After the stabbing, Tenorio ran towards the municipal building. Near the fence, he encountered Patrolman Cadaoas. Tenorio immediately threw away his bolo, raised his hands, and admitted to stabbing Bello. Although another policeman, Patrolman Quatchon, was chasing him from behind, Tenorio was unaware of this.

Tenorio was charged with murder qualified by evident premeditation and attended by treachery and contempt of public authorities. He pleaded guilty but invoked the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Ilocos Sur found him guilty of murder and imposed the death penalty. The CFI ruled that voluntary surrender was not present because Tenorio was "cornered" by the two policemen, and that the aggravating circumstances of treachery and contempt of public authorities were present (one offset by the plea of guilty). The case was elevated for automatic review.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender should be appreciated.
2. W/N the aggravating circumstance of contempt of or with insult to the public authorities is present.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that Tenorio’s actions indicated an intent to surrender voluntarily. The evidence showed he did not look back while running and was unaware that Patrolman Quatchon was chasing him. Instead of escaping through an available opening in the fence to avoid the crowd, he ran toward the municipal building where authorities were present. Upon seeing Patrolman Cadaoas, who had not even drawn his gun, Tenorio voluntarily threw his weapon and raised his hands [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The crime was committed in a public plaza during a peace rally where public officials, including the Acting Provincial Governor, Mayor, and Judge, were present on an elevated stage viewable by the public [3]. Furthermore, the Court held that a plea of guilty constitutes an admission of the aggravating circumstances alleged in the information [3-5].

The Supreme Court modified the judgment. Since the two mitigating circumstances (plea of guilty and voluntary surrender) offset the two aggravating circumstances (treachery and contempt of public authorities), the penalty was reduced to the medium period. Tenorio was sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* [6].
