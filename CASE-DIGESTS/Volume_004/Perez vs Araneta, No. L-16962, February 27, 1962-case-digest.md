I. CAPTION
TRUSTEESHIP OF THE MINORS BENIGNO, ANGELA and ANTONIO, all surnamed PEREZ Y TUASON; ANTONIO M. PEREZ, Judicial-Guardian-Appellant, v. J. ANTONIO ARANETA, Trustee-Appellee, G.R. No. L-16962, February 27, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Angela S. Tuason died in 1948, leaving a will that established a trust for her grandchildren—Benigno, Angela, and Antonio Perez y Tuason. The will appointed J. Antonio Araneta as trustee, authorizing him to sell trust properties and use the proceeds to acquire other assets. The trustee was also mandated to deliver the "net rentals" (*rentas netas*) of the administration to the beneficiaries [1, 2].

Between 1956 and 1958, Araneta sold portions of the trust property, realizing a total profit of P98,828.88 over the original appraised value [3]. Antonio M. Perez, the minors' judicial guardian, filed a motion claiming this amount constituted income or profits to which the beneficiaries were entitled. The trustee objected, arguing the amount was part of the capital. The lower court denied the guardian's motion, ruling against the distribution of the sale proceeds [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the profits realized from the sale of the trust properties constitute income to be delivered to the beneficiaries.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that profits realized from the sale of trust properties are part of the capital held in trust, not income usable by beneficiaries [4].

First, the Court looked at the intent of the testatrix. The will explicitly authorized the trustee to sell property and "acquire, with the proceeds of the sale, other property." This clearly indicated an intent to keep the proceeds (including any appreciation in value) within the trust rather than distributing them as "net rentals" [4].

Second, applying the general law on trusts pursuant to Article 1442 of the Civil Code, the corpus of the estate remains the same capital fund regardless of changes in form (e.g., from real estate to money) [5, 6]. The Court cited *In re Graham's Estate* and the Restatement of the Law to establish that money received by a trustee as proceeds from the sale of principal remains principal [6, 7].

The Order appealed from is AFFIRMED [8].
