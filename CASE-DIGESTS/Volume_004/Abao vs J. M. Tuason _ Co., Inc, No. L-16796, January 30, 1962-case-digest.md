I. CAPTION
ALEJANDRO ABAO, ET AL. v. J. M. TUASON & CO., INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-16796, January 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Sixty-seven (67) plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against J. M. Tuason & Co., Inc. and Gregorio Araneta, Inc. [1]. The plaintiffs claimed to be occupants and owners of residential lots in Quezon City, having purchased them from the "Deudors" [1]. They alleged that a 1953 Compromise Agreement between the Deudors and the defendant corporations recognized the plaintiffs' rights to the lots [1]. Plaintiffs sought to enforce their contracts with the Deudors against the defendants and to enjoin the defendants from proceeding with ejectment suits filed in the CFI of Rizal (Quezon City Branch) [1, 2].

The defendants filed motions to dismiss on the ground of improper venue [3]. The CFI of Manila granted the motions and dismissed the complaint, ruling that since the lots were not located in Manila, venue was improperly laid [3]. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing that the suit was a personal action for specific performance properly filed in Manila where defendants held office, and that defendants had waived venue in a "similar" case involving a different party [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action was properly dismissed for improper venue.
2. W/N the defendants waived their right to object to venue based on their actions in a separate case.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal was proper because the venue was improperly laid [4]. Although framed as specific performance, the action relies on the plaintiffs' claim that they are "occupants," "landholders," and "owners by purchase" of the residential lots [5]. The suit seeks to enforce title and possession against the defendants' Torrens title and to prevent ouster [5]. Therefore, the action obviously affects not only the possession of real property but also the title thereto [4]. Under Rule 5, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, such actions must be instituted in the Court of First Instance of the province where the property is situated [4]. Since the lots are in Quezon City (Rizal), the CFI of Manila had no proper venue [4].

2. **NO.** The Court rejected the argument that defendants waived venue because they did not object to it in a "similar and identical" case (*Philippine Sugar Estates Development Co., Ltd. v. J. M. Tuason & Co., Inc.*) [4]. The plaintiffs were not parties to that previous case, and the defendants expressly objected to the venue in the present case at the first opportunity [4].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [6].
