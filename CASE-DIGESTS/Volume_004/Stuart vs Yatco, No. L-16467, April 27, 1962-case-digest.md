**I. CAPTION**
FLORENTINA MATA DE STUART v. THE HONORABLE NICASIO YATCO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, G.R. No. L-16467, April 27, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
On January 6, 1960, petitioner Florentina Mata de Stuart filed a petition for "amendment of title" with the respondent court. She alleged that she is the registered owner of a parcel of land in Quezon City under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 19979, registered in the name of "Florentina Mata de Stuart, Filipino, of age, married to Eugenio Stuart." Her husband, Eugenio Stuart, died in 1950 and was survived by their children, who executed a quitclaim deed acknowledging the land as her paraphernal property [1]. She prayed for the issuance of a new certificate of title in her name as a widow [1].

Respondent Judge Nicasio Yatco denied the petition, ruling that the case was not contemplated under Section 112 of Act 496 (Land Registration Act). The judge reasoned that the petition effectively called for a declaration that the property is paraphernal, which he believed required a different proceeding [2]. After her motion for reconsideration failed, Stuart filed a petition for mandamus with the Supreme Court to compel the judge to assume jurisdiction [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the trial court judge can be compelled to take cognizance of the petition for amendment of title under Section 112 of Act 496 to update the registered owner's civil status.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the respondent judge took a restricted view of the court's powers. Under Section 112 of Act 496, a registered owner may apply for relief by petition to the court upon the ground that "the registered owner has married, or if registered as married, that the marriage has been terminated" [2].

The Court rejected the lower court's concern that granting the amendment amounts to a declaration of paraphernal property. Citing *Litam v. Espiritu* (1956), the Court explained that the registration of property in the name of "M.R. married to R.L." already indicates that the property belongs to the registered owner as her paraphernal property. The phrase "married to" is merely descriptive of the civil status of the registered owner. If the property were conjugal, the title would have been issued in the names of both spouses (e.g., "R.L. and M.R.") [3]. Thus, the amendment sought was proper.

The petition for mandamus is **GRANTED**, and the respondent judge is ordered to take cognizance of the petition [4].
