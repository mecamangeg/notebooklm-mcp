I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AUGUSTO ROGEL, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15318, March 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On August 10, 1955, appellant Eliseo Ramos, together with Feliciano Bugagao and others, conspired to rob the Tigman Sawmill in Camarines Sur and kidnap the Chinese manager, Ty Twi, for ransom. Ramos was designated as the leader of the band. That evening, the group robbed the sawmill and took Ty Twi with them. Ramos stood guard during the robbery and supervised the plunder but separated from the group after they reached the national road. The following day, August 11, co-accused Augusto Rogel killed and buried Ty Twi because the victim kept shouting. The Court of First Instance convicted Ramos and his co-accused of robbery with homicide. Ramos appealed, arguing he should be liable only for simple robbery as the killing was not part of the plan and he was not present when it occurred.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N appellant Ramos is liable for robbery with homicide despite being absent during the killing.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, ruling that whenever a homicide is committed as a consequence or on the occasion of a robbery, all those who took part as principals in the robbery are also guilty of the complex crime of robbery with homicide [1]. This liability attaches even if they did not actually take part in the homicide, unless it clearly appears that they endeavored to prevent it, citing *U.S. v. Macalalad* and *People v. Bautista* [1-3].

As the leader of the conspiracy, Ramos is liable for all the consequences of the acts of his co-conspirators [4]. It is immaterial that the killing occurred at a different place or time, or that the appellant did not know the exact role of others, provided the homicide was produced by reason or on the occasion of the robbery [5, 6]. In this case, the victim was killed because his shouting threatened to reveal the robbery, making the killing an incident of the crime [6, 7].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** with modification increasing the civil indemnity [8, 9].
