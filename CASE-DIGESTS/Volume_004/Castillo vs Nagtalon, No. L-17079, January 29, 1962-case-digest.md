I. CAPTION
CASTILLO v. NAGTALON, G.R. No. L-17079, January 29, 1962

II. FACTS
A money judgment for damages and costs amounting to P3,401.00 was rendered against twelve defendants, including appellee Simplicia Nagtalon [1]. To satisfy the judgment, ten parcels of land were levied upon and sold at public auction; three of these parcels belonged exclusively to Nagtalon [1]. These three parcels were sold to a third party, Martiniano Factor, for a total of P1,291.00, significantly higher than Nagtalon's 1/12 share of the judgment debt, which was only P317.44 [1, 2]. Nagtalon tendered P317.44 to redeem the properties, arguing her liability was merely joint [3]. The lower court ruled the tender valid and ordered the issuance of a certificate of redemption [3]. Nagtalon also claimed she had no knowledge of the purchase price because the certificate of sale was not registered [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the liability of the defendants under the judgment is solidary.
2. W/N the tender of payment of the judgment debt share (P317.44) is sufficient to redeem the properties sold for P1,291.00.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The liability is joint. The Supreme Court held that the portion of a decision that becomes the subject of execution is that ordained or decreed in the dispositive part thereof [5, 6]. Since the dispositive portion of the prior decision did not specifically declare the defendants' liability to be solidary, it must be taken to be joint only [5, 6]. While the body of the decision may have implied a tortious act warranting solidary liability under Article 2194 of the Civil Code, this argument loses efficacy once the judgment becomes final and executory [3, 6].

2. **NO.** Under Section 26, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, the amount payable for redemption is the **purchase price** (plus 1% interest per month), not the judgment debt [7, 8]. Since the properties were sold for P1,291.00, Nagtalon's tender of P317.44 was insufficient to release the properties [8]. Regarding the alleged failure to register the certificate of sale, the Court ruled that non-compliance with Section 24, Rule 39 (filing duplicate certificate) does not invalidate the sale unless injury is caused [9, 10]. Furthermore, Nagtalon was estopped from impugning the regularity of the sale because she failed to object at the opportune time and instead offered to redeem the property [2, 4]. However, as the tender was made in good faith, the Court granted Nagtalon a period of 15 days to complete the redemption payment based on the purchase price [8].
