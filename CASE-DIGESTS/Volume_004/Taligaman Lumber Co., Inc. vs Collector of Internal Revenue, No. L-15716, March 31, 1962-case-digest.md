**I. CAPTION**
TALIGAMAN LUMBER CO., INC. v. THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-15716, March 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Taligaman Lumber Co., Inc., a forest concessionaire and lumber dealer, was assessed deficiency sales taxes and surcharges for the years 1948 to 1953 regarding sales from its Grace Park and Butuan City branches [1-3]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) reduced the assessments but still sentenced Petitioner to pay an aggregate sum of P85,790.91 [1, 4]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that: (1) the government's right to collect taxes for 1948 and 1949 had prescribed under Section 331 of the Tax Code; and (2) the export sales to Japanese buyers by its Butuan branch were consummated abroad and thus not subject to Philippine sales tax [4, 5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the government's right to assess deficiency taxes for 1948 and 1949 is barred by prescription.
2. W/N the export sales to Japan are subject to Philippine sales tax.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The right to assess has not prescribed. While Section 331 of the Internal Revenue Code provides a five-year limitation period from the filing of the return, Section 332(a) allows for assessment within ten years in cases of failure to file a return [6, 7]. Since prescription is an affirmative defense, the burden was on the Petitioner to prove that it had actually filed returns for the years in question to avail of the five-year limitation [7]. The Petitioner failed to present evidence that returns were filed; therefore, the ten-year period under Section 332 applies, and the assessment is valid [7].

2. **YES.** The export sales are subject to sales tax. The agreed price for the logs was "F.O.B. Agusan" [5]. This creates a *prima facie* presumption that the parties intended for the title to pass to the buyer upon delivery of the logs in Agusan, on board the vessels bound for Japan [5]. Petitioner failed to introduce the contracts of sale to prove its claim that title passed in Japan [5]. Citing *Bislig Lumber Co. v. Collector* and related jurisprudence, the Court held that the sales were consummated in the Philippines [8].

**Decision affirmed.**
