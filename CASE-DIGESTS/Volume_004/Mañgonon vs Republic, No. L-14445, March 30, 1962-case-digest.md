I. CAPTION
FELIZARDO C. MAÑGONON, ETC. v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14445, March 30, 1962, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
On November 3, 1948, E.S. Baltao & Co., Inc. entered into a contract with the Republic of the Philippines (Director of Public Works) to construct the Alcala Revetment Project [1]. Following the rescission of the contract by the Republic, the contractor filed a claim on December 9, 1949, for P64,205.38 representing expenses for labor and materials incurred prior to rescission [1, 2]. On December 21, 1956, the Auditor General approved the claim only in the amount of P15,785.10 [2, 3].

Instead of appealing, the contractor assigned the approved amount of P15,785.10 to petitioner Felizardo C. Mañgonon on January 7, 1957 [3]. Mañgonon subsequently requested reconsideration for the balance of the original claim, but the Auditor General denied it because the December 21, 1956 decision had become final under Commonwealth Act No. 327 [4]. On March 31, 1958, Mañgonon filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to recover the difference [5]. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that the action was barred as the Auditor General's decision had become final [6]. Mañgonon appealed, arguing his claim was for "unliquidated damages" over which the Auditor General has no jurisdiction [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's claim constitutes unliquidated damages such that it falls outside the jurisdiction of the Auditor General to render a final decision.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the claim is a money claim based on contract, not a claim for unliquidated damages founded on neglect or breach of obligations [2, 8].

The Court explained that the claim represented the total investment or expense incurred in carrying out the contract terms, and its settlement could be done by "simple arithmetical processes" using vouchers and receipts [2, 8]. Citing *Cia. General de Tabacos vs. French*, the Court distinguished claims for money due on contracts (where prices are determinable by vouchers) from unliquidated damages for breach [7]. Since the claim was within the Auditor General's jurisdiction, and the contractor failed to appeal the decision within 30 days as required by Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 327, the decision became final [3, 9]. Furthermore, the assignment of the approved amount to the petitioner indicated conformity to the Auditor General's decision [9].

The Order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED** [10].
