I. CAPTION
LEOPOLDO M. SY-QUIA, ET AL. v. HON. FELIX ANTONIO, MARY A. MARSMAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18262, March 31, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On December 28, 1960, petitioners (Sy-quia group) filed Civil Case No. 6427 in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to enjoin respondent Mary Marsman and her board from presiding over the annual meeting of Marsman Investments, Ltd. [1, 2]. The complaint alleged Marsman was disqualified due to age and conflict of interest regarding a "Confirmation of Sale" of shares to be discussed, but did not explicitly ask to nullify the sale itself [3]. Armed with a preliminary injunction, petitioners took control of the meeting and elected a new board [4].

On December 31, 1960, respondents (Marsman group) filed Civil Case No. 45935 in the CFI of Manila against petitioners to affirm the validity of the sale of 2,500,000 shares to Mary Marsman and question the authority of the new board [5]. Subsequently, on January 6, 1961, petitioners amended their complaint in the Rizal case to expressly challenge the validity of the share sale [6]. Petitioners then moved to dismiss the Manila case on the ground of *litis pendentia* (pendency of the Rizal case) [7]. Respondent Judge Antonio denied the motion, ruling that the amendment in the Rizal case could not retroactively oust the Manila court of jurisdiction it had already acquired [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Manila CFI case should be dismissed due to the pendency of the Rizal CFI case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the denial of the motion to dismiss. The Court held that prior to the amendment of the Rizal complaint on January 6, 1961, there was no identity of subject matter between the two cases; the original Rizal complaint focused solely on the *right to preside* over the meeting and the age disqualification of Mary Marsman, not the *validity of the sale* of shares [3, 9]. The Manila case, filed on December 31, 1960, was the first to squarely place the validity of the sale in issue [5].

The Court ruled that while amendments generally relate back to the date of the original complaint, this doctrine does not apply when it would prejudice a pending action that has already acquired jurisdiction over the new subject matter [10]. Considerations of justice will not countenance the dismissal of a duly constituted action (the Manila case) by the mere expediency of amending a complaint in another case to comprehend a subject matter not originally included therein [10]. The petition was dismissed [11].
