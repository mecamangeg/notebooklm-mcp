I. CAPTION
ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP OF CEBU v. THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-16683, January 31, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cebu filed income tax returns for 1955 and 1956, claiming deductions for depreciation of buildings and fixtures [1]. Respondent Collector of Internal Revenue disallowed these deductions and assessed deficiency taxes [1]. Petitioner filed consecutive requests for reconsideration. The first was denied on July 18, 1957 [2, 3]. A second request was denied on November 5, 1957, which Petitioner received on November 21, 1957 [3]. Petitioner filed a third request on November 23, 1957, reiterating previous arguments, which was denied on January 20, 1958 [2, 3].

Meanwhile, Respondent issued a warrant of distraint and levy on December 4, 1957 [4]. To forestall the sale of properties, Petitioner paid the tax under protest on February 7, 1958, and filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) on February 1, 1958 [4, 5]. The CTA dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that Petitioner failed to file a claim for refund under Section 306 of the Tax Code, which it deemed a condition precedent for the appeal [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the filing of a claim for refund is a condition precedent for an appeal to the CTA when a disputed assessment is paid under protest to prevent distraint.
2. W/N the petition for review was filed within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that Section 7 of R.A. 1125 allows appeals from decisions involving "disputed assessments" distinct from cases involving refunds. Since the Petitioner protested the assessment upon receipt and only paid to prevent the sale of his properties, requiring him to file a separate claim for refund would be a "useless and needless ceremony" [7]. The Collector would certainly disallow the refund claim just as he disallowed the protest against the assessment [7]. The law should not be interpreted to result in absurdities [7].

2. **NO.** Despite the error regarding the refund claim, the dismissal was affirmed because the appeal was filed out of time. The 30-day appeal period commenced upon Petitioner's receipt of the denial of the *second* request for reconsideration on November 21, 1957 [5]. The third request for reconsideration was merely *pro forma* as it did not advance new grounds; thus, it did not interrupt the running of the appeal period [5]. The deadline to appeal was December 21, 1957, but the petition was filed only on February 1, 1958 [5].

Decision affirmed.
