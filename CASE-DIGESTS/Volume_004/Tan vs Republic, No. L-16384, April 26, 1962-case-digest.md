I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO CHANGE THE NAME OF GO CHANG TO JAYME S. TAN, JAYME S. TAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16384, April 26, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Go Chang, a Chinese citizen born in the Philippines, filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu to change his name to "Jayme S. Tan." He alleged that while his registered name is Go Chang, he has been known as "Jayme S. Tan" in school and by his friends. He claimed the change was necessary because the Board of Medical Examiners refused to admit him for examinations without a court order reconciling his name with his school records. The CFI granted the petition. The Solicitor General appealed, noting a substantial defect: the verified petition spelled the name as "**Jayme** S. Tan," but the order published in the newspaper spelled it as "**Jaime** S. Tan."

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defect in the spelling of the petitioner's name in the publication ("Jaime" instead of "Jayme") divested the court of jurisdiction.
2. W/N there is a proper and reasonable cause for the change of name.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** (The defect prevented jurisdiction). Petitions for change of name are proceedings *in rem*, and strict compliance with publication requirements is essential for the court to acquire jurisdiction [1, 2]. The defect in the spelling of the name in the published order is substantial because it fails to correctly identify the party to the proceedings [3]. The Court held that a difference of even one letter in a name may determine the distinction of identity between two different persons [4].

2. **NO.** The Court found no reasonable circumstance to warrant the change. Documentary evidence (baptismal and college records) showed the petitioner actually used "Jaime," contradicting his claim that he continuously used "Jayme," and thus proving the allegations in the petition false [4, 5]. Furthermore, the real name of a person is that given in the Civil Register, not the name used in the community or school [5]. Granting the petition would only add to the confusion and effectively sanction the petitioner's violation of the Anti-Alias Law (Commonwealth Act No. 142) for using a name other than his registered one [5].

Decision reversed; petition denied [6].
