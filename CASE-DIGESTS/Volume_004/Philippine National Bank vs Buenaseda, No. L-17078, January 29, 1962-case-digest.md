I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. FRANCISCO BUENASEDA, G.R. No. L-17078, January 29, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Philippine National Bank (PNB) obtained a judgment against Philippine Lumber Distributing Agency, Inc. (PLDA) and was authorized to sue Francisco Buenaseda to collect an unpaid balance. In 1947, Buenaseda purchased lumber from PLDA totaling P15,594.00, evidenced by 21 sales orders and 69 delivery receipts [1, 2]. He made payments totaling P11,568.35, with the last payment made on July 13, 1949, leaving a balance of P4,025.85 [1].

PNB filed the complaint for collection on May 7, 1957 [3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that the sales orders and delivery receipts did not constitute a "written contract." Consequently, the court held that the action had prescribed because the 6-year prescriptive period for oral contracts had elapsed since the cause of action accrued [3]. PNB appealed, arguing the documents constituted a written contract subject to a 10-year prescriptive period [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action based on the sales orders and delivery receipts is barred by the statute of limitations for oral contracts.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the action is barred by the statute of limitations [5].

Under Act 190 (the law applicable at the time), an action based on a written contract prescribes in 10 years, while an action on a contract not in writing prescribes in 6 years [6]. The Court held that for a document to be considered a "writing" for the statute of limitations, it must contain an express promise to pay or language from which a promise to pay arises by fair implication *on its face* [4]. If the promise arises only upon proof of extrinsic facts (*evidence aliunde*), or if the agreement is partly oral and partly written, it does not fall within the 10-year statute of limitations [4].

Examining the documents, the Court found that the delivery receipts merely certified delivery without indicating price or terms of payment [7, 8]. While some sales orders contained the instruction "charge to my account," the Court ruled this was indefinite and did not contain the amount or manner of payment [9, 10]. Because these essential terms had to be supplied by oral proof, the agreement was considered partly oral and partly written, placing it under the 6-year prescriptive period [10]. Since the last payment occurred in 1949 and the complaint was filed in 1957, the action had already prescribed.

**Petition DENIED. Decision affirmed.**
