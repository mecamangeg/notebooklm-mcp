I. CAPTION
ELIGIO T. LEYVA and EUFEMIA L. LEYVA v. MANUELA JANDOC and HON. JOSE S. BORROMEO, Judge of Court of First Instance of Cotabato, G.R. No. L-16965, February 28, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On September 10, 1958, respondent Manuela Jandoc applied for the registration of three parcels of land in General Santos, Cotabato [1]. Petitioners Eligio and Eufemia Leyva filed oppositions, initially claiming adverse possession and ownership of portions of the land since 1937 [1]. The Bureau of Lands also filed an opposition, claiming the land was part of the public domain [1].

During the hearing, petitioners' counsel admitted that their right to the land was based merely on a foreshore lease contract with the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources [2]. Consequently, the trial court ruled that because petitioners' claim was dependent on the land being declared public domain, they had no right to appear as independent oppositors and could only collaborate with the provincial fiscal [2]. The petitioners filed a petition with the Court of Appeals to annul this order, but it was dismissed [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners, as foreshore lessees, have the right to intervene as independent oppositors in the land registration case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. Although Section 34 of Act No. 496 allows any person claiming an interest to file an opposition, the Court held that such opposition "must be based on a right of dominion or some other real right independent of, and not at all subordinate to, the rights of the Government" [4].

Since the petitioners' right as foreshore lessees is completely subordinate to the interests of the Government and is necessarily predicated on the property being part of the public domain, it is incumbent upon the duly authorized representatives of the Government to represent its interests [5]. Petitioners have no right to appear as independent oppositors but may only collaborate with the provincial fiscal [6]. Furthermore, since land registration is an action *in rem*, claims which do not partake of the nature of real rights or rights *in rem* should not be settled therein [7], [8].

Decision affirmed [8].
