I. CAPTION
JOSE BELEY, in his capacity as Registrar of the Motor Vehicles Office, Nueva Ecija Agency v. HON. GENARO TAN TORRES, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija and FELIX B. MARBELLA, G.R. No. L-17689, January 30, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Felix Marbella filed a civil case against local police officers for the alleged illegal detention of his truck and its license plate. The trial court ordered the release of the truck. Subsequently, the defendants seized the truck’s license plate and the driver’s license of Marbella’s driver, Quirico Curamen [1, 2]. Marbella filed a motion in the same civil case for their return, which the lower court granted, directing Petitioner Jose Beley, the Registrar of the Motor Vehicles Office, to return the items [2, 3]. Beley, who was not a party to the original case, objected to the jurisdiction and the order [4]. It was established that the truck was not registered for the current year and was displaying a plate belonging to another person (Agripina Vidal), which had been reported lost [5, 6]. Beley filed a petition for certiorari to review the lower court's order [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the confiscation and retention of the license plate and driver's license were lawful.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The confiscation was lawful because it was done in response to a violation of the Motor Vehicle Law [6]. The truck was operating on public highways without the corresponding certificate of registration and was displaying a plate that did not belong to it [6]. Specifically, the plate was "evidently a stolen plate" belonging to another vehicle owner [6, 8].

Furthermore, the retention of the items was justified under Section 12, Rule 122 of the Rules of Court, which permits the police or public prosecuting officer to retain a thing stolen or anything which may be used as proof of the commission of an offense [8, 9]. The plate and license constituted evidence that Marbella was operating an unregistered truck with a stolen plate [8].

Petition granted. The order subject of the petition is set aside [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
