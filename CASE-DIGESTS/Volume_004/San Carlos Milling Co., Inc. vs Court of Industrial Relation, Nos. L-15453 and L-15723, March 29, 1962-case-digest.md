I. CAPTION
SAN CARLOS MILLING CO., INC. and ALLIED WORKERS ASSOCIATION OF THE PHILIPPINES (AWA) v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and PHILIPPINE LAND-AIR-SEA LABOR UNION (PLASLU), SINFOROSO KYAMKO & 150 OTHERS, G.R. Nos. L-15453 and L-15723, March 29, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioners San Carlos Milling Co. (Company) and Allied Workers Association (AWA) entered into a union shop agreement. Paragraph 4 of the agreement required new employees to affiliate with AWA, with dismissal as the penalty for refusal or expulsion [3]. Paragraph 5 classified existing employees into two groups: those with 10 or more years of service, and those with less. Existing employees with less than 10 years of service, such as respondent Sinforoso Kyamko, were required to join AWA within 30 days [3]. However, the contract did not expressly provide for their dismissal in the event of subsequent expulsion from the union [4].

Kyamko was expelled from AWA and subsequently dismissed by the Company. In response, PLASLU members staged a strike. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found the dismissal unjustified and ordered reinstatement with backpay [2]. The Company had also renewed its closed-shop agreement with AWA on December 11, 1955, despite knowing that PLASLU had petitioned for a certification election on December 2, 1955, which PLASLU eventually won [5]. The petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Supreme Court's main decision affirming the CIR [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal of an employee for failure to maintain union membership is valid if the collective bargaining agreement does not expressly stipulate it.
2. W/N the strike staged by PLASLU members in support of the dismissed employee was illegal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that for employees already working at the time a bargaining contract is made, dismissal for non-union membership must be "expressly and unequivocally stipulated" [4]. While the agreement required Kyamko to join AWA, it did not explicitly mandate his dismissal upon subsequent expulsion [4]. The Court relied on the doctrine in *Confederated Sons of Labor vs. Anakan Lumber Co.*, holding that such dismissals are viewed with disfavor and strictly construed against the existence of such a right [4, 6].

2. **NO.** The discharge of Kyamko being "patently unjustified," the supporting action by PLASLU members cannot be deemed an illegal strike [5]. Consequently, the strikers could not be penalized by discharge or refusal of reinstatement [5]. Furthermore, the Company acted at its own risk by renewing the agreement with AWA while PLASLU's petition for certification election was pending [5].

The Motions for Reconsideration are **DENIED**. [7]
