I. CAPTION
OTILIO R. GOROSPE v. RAMON O. NOLASCO, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-14745, March 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In 1947, Pastor Romero gave Otilio Gorospe P3,000 to purchase a lot in Manila [1]. Gorospe later claimed he contracted a lot for Romero’s daughter, but Romero discovered Gorospe had actually acquired the title in his own name [1]. On June 7, 1956, Romero filed a civil complaint (Civil Case No. 30378) against Gorospe to recover ownership of the lot or the sum paid [1]. Romero also filed a criminal complaint for estafa [2].

The civil trial was initially postponed pending the criminal investigation, but Romero eventually failed to appear at the hearing [3]. Consequently, the trial court dismissed the civil complaint for failure to prosecute and awarded Gorospe attorney's fees on his counterclaim [4]. This judgment became final [4].

Subsequently, the City Fiscal filed an Information for estafa against Gorospe (Criminal Case No. 41992) [5]. Gorospe moved to quash, arguing the civil case dismissal barred the criminal prosecution. The trial court denied the motion [5]. Gorospe filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals to enjoin the criminal trial, but the CA dismissed his petition [6, 7]. Gorospe appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the civil action constitutes a bar to the prosecution of the criminal action for estafa.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal of the civil action does not bar the criminal prosecution.

The Court reasoned that fraud is not an essential element of the civil suit (which could be liable merely for breach of contract), whereas the action for estafa is specifically predicated upon deceit [8]. Under Article 31 of the Civil Code, a civil action based on an obligation not arising from the act complained of as a felony may proceed independently of the criminal proceedings [9].

Furthermore, under Section 1(e), Rule 107 of the Rules of Court, a final judgment in a civil action absolving the defendant from civil liability is no bar to a criminal action [9]. Since the civil case was dismissed without the presentation of evidence, the court made no finding of fact that the alleged act did not exist, which is the only scenario that would make it impossible to hold the defendant liable for estafa [9].

Petition denied [10].
