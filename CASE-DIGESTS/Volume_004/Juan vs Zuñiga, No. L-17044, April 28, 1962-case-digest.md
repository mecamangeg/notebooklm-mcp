I. CAPTION
EUSTAQUIO JUAN, ET AL. v. VICENTA ZUÑIGA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17044, April 28, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In 1931, Luciana Ciderio died leaving Lot 1175 to her four children: Ines, Crisanto, Ciriaco, and Bartolome Francisco [1]. In 1932, Crisanto, Ciriaco, and Bartolome executed an extrajudicial partition fraudulently claiming to be the sole heirs, excluding Ines, and secured a new transfer certificate of title in their names [2, 3]. Ines died in 1939, leaving the plaintiffs as heirs [3]. The three brothers eventually transferred their shares; Crisanto and Bartolome sold their portions to Vicenta Zuñiga, while Ciriaco died in 1934, leaving his share to his daughter, defendant Gavina Francisco [3-5].

In 1957, plaintiffs filed an action to recover Ines' share [6]. The Court of First Instance of Bulacan dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription, ruling that the 1932 registration served as constructive notice of the fraud, and the action was filed too late [6, 7]. On appeal, plaintiffs abandoned their claim against Zuñiga (an innocent purchaser) but persisted against Gavina Francisco for the excess portion of the land Ciriaco received through the fraudulent partition [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs' action to recover the property held by the trustee (heir of the fraudulent registrant) is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's dismissal regarding Gavina Francisco. The Court held that when a person obtains legal title to property by fraud or concealment, a constructive trust is created in favor of the defrauded party, granting the latter the right to vindicate the property regardless of the lapse of time [9, 10].

While the registration of real property under the Torrens system generally acts as constructive notice to the whole world for ordinary recovery actions, this rule "cannot be availed of when the purpose of the action is to compel a trustee to convey the property registered in his name for the benefit of the *cestui que trust*" [9, 11]. Citing *Castro v. Castro* and *Cristobal v. Gomez*, the Court ruled that the defense of prescription cannot be set up in an action to enforce a trust, as a contrary view would permit unjust enrichment [12].

The decision of the lower court was **REVERSED** insofar as it affected the plaintiffs' rights against Gavina Francisco, and the case was remanded for further proceedings [13].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Reyes, J.B.L., J., concurred in the result [13].
