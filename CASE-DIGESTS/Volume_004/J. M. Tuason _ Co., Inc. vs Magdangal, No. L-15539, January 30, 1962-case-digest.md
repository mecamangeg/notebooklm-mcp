**I. CAPTION**
J. M. TUASON & CO., INC. v. ADOLFO MAGDANGAL, G.R. No. L-15539, January 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
On January 7, 1959, plaintiff J. M. Tuason & Co., Inc. filed a complaint for recovery of possession against defendant Adolfo Magdangal involving 700 square meters of land in Tatalon, Quezon City, covered by the plaintiff's Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1267 [1]. Magdangal answered, claiming he bought the land from Eustaquio Alquiros, a successor of Tomas Deudor, and that the plaintiff's title was void due to misrepresentation of boundaries [2].

Trial was set for March 19, 1959. On March 17, Magdangal filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground of *litis pendentia*, citing a pending reconveyance case filed by his vendor, Alquiros, against the plaintiff [3]. He set the motion for hearing on March 21. On the March 19 trial date, Magdangal argued he was not ready for trial until his motion was resolved. The court, noting Magdangal had notice of the trial since March 4 and viewing the motion as dilatory, denied the motion and ordered the presentation of evidence before a commissioner [4]. Magdangal objected to the trial by commissioner, refused to submit to it, and left the court [5].

The lower court rendered judgment ordering Magdangal to vacate the premises and pay damages. Magdangal appealed, arguing the court erred in denying his motion without a hearing and delegating the trial to a commissioner without his consent [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the trial court erred in hearing and denying the Motion to Dismiss before the scheduled hearing date set by the movant.
2. W/N the delegation of the trial to a commissioner without the defendant's consent renders the proceedings void.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The three-day notice rule for motions is intended to avoid surprises to the opposing party and give them time to study the arguments. It is not for the movant's benefit [6]. Since the plaintiff (opposing party) objected to the motion in open court on March 19 and was willing to have it resolved, the court was not precluded from disposing of it earlier than the scheduled date [7, 8]. Furthermore, the defendant had ample time between March 6 (when he learned of the other action) and March 19 to file the motion, yet he delayed until two days before trial [8].

2. **NO.** The delegation of a trial to a commissioner without the consent of a party is merely a procedural irregularity that does not render the proceedings void unless substantial prejudice to the defendant's rights is shown [9, 10]. In this case, no prejudice occurred because even if the defendant had presented his defenses (validity of title), they would have been overcome by the indefeasibility of the plaintiff's title, which was issued in 1914 [11]. Any action for reconveyance based on constructive trust would have already prescribed [11].

**Disposition:** The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED, with costs against appellant Adolfo Magdangal [12].
