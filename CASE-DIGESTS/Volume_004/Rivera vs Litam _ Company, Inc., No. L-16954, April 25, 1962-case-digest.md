I. CAPTION
ARMINIO RIVERA v. LITAM & COMPANY, INC., et al., G.R. No. L-16954, April 25, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Rafael Litam died intestate in 1951, leaving a substantial debt of over P250,000 to his wife, Marcosa Rivera. Plaintiff Arminio Rivera, the administrator of Rafael's estate, filed an action to recover 54/204 shares of stock in Litam & Co., Inc., alleging they belonged to the decedent. The defendants—the corporation and Rafael’s alleged children by a Chinese marriage—claimed Rafael had transferred these shares to them on January 25, 1950. Plaintiff contended the transfers were fictitious, without consideration, and executed in fraud of creditors. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, declaring the transfers void and ordering the successor corporation to issue shares or pay their value. Defendants appealed, arguing the transfers were valid and that they were denied a new trial because they failed to receive notice of the hearing after their counsel withdrew.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the transfer of shares from the decedent to the defendants is void.
2. W/N the new corporation is liable for the obligations of the dissolved corporation it succeeded.
3. W/N the defendants are entitled to a new trial due to lack of notice.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The transfer is void. The Court found the transaction simulated and in fraud of creditors, evidenced by the following badges of fraud: the transferees were the decedent's own children; no consideration was given; the shares were the decedent's only property; he was heavily indebted; and the transfers were kept secret. Under Articles 1352 and 1409 of the Civil Code, absolute simulation and lack of cause render the contract void. Furthermore, Article 1388 provides that those who acquire things in fraud of creditors in bad faith must indemnify the latter.

2. **YES.** The new corporation is liable. While a new corporation is generally distinct from the old, the new Litam & Co., Inc. expressly assumed the obligations and liabilities of the dissolved corporation in its Articles of Incorporation. It cannot subsequently excuse itself from these liabilities to the prejudice of the estate.

3. **NO.** The petition for a new trial was properly denied. The defendants' failure to hire new counsel after their previous lawyers withdrew, and their failure to inform the court of their change of address, constituted inexcusable negligence. Under Rule 27, Sec. 8 of the Rules of Court, service of notice by registered mail is deemed completed five days after receipt of the first notice, regardless of whether the defendants actually claimed the letters.

The judgment is affirmed.
