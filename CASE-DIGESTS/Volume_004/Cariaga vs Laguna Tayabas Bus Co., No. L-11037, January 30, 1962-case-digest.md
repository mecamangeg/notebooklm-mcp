I. CAPTION
EDGARDO CARIAGA, ET AL. v. LAGUNA TAYABAS BUS CO., ET AL., G.R. No. L-11037, January 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants Edgardo Cariaga, et al. appealed a judgment from the Court of First Instance of Laguna [1, 2]. In a previous decision on the case, the Supreme Court increased the award of compensatory damages from P10,490.00 to P25,000.00 but affirmed the lower court's judgment in all other respects, with costs against the defendant-appellant Laguna Tayabas Bus Co. [3]. On December 12, 1961, the plaintiffs-appellants filed a Motion for Clarification seeking to determine if the increased award of P25,000.00 should bear interest [3]. The parties held conflicting opinions on whether interest should apply to the total increased amount or solely to the original amount awarded by the lower court [4]. The Court found it necessary to resolve this to guide the lower court in executing the final judgment [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the interest on damages should be computed based on the increased amount of P25,000.00 awarded by the Supreme Court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that interest shall be exclusively on the sum of P10,490.00 as provided in the decision of the lower court [5]. The Supreme Court reasoned that its decision simply increased the compensatory damages to P25,000.00 without expressly providing that the "increase" shall also draw interest at the same rate as the original amount [5]. Since the Court affirmed the lower court's decision in all other respects, the judgment must be construed as awarding no interest on the amount by which the compensatory damages were increased [5]. The clarification was issued to guide the execution of the judgment [4].
