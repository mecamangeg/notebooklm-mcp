**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. SANTIAGO NG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16302, February 28, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Santiago Ng, a Chinese national born in Boac, Marinduque, filed a petition for naturalization. He established that he was a merchant with sufficient capital, had resided in the Philippines for over 30 years, spoke English and Tagalog, and had no criminal record. To support his petition, he presented two character witnesses, Miguel Manguera and Jose Madrigal. These witnesses testified to Ng's good character, industriousness, and social mingling with Filipinos, expressing their belief that he would make a good citizen. The Court of First Instance of Marinduque admitted Ng to Philippine citizenship. The Republic of the Philippines appealed, arguing that the evidence was deficient in proving the petitioner did not possess the disqualifications for citizenship.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner sufficiently proved the absence of disqualifications for naturalization through his witnesses.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court ruled that the absence of disqualifications provided in the law is "part and parcel" of the case for naturalization, and it is incumbent upon the applicant to prove the same in addition to his positive qualifications [1, 2].

The witnesses' testimony was found deficient because, while they established Ng's good character and lack of criminal record, they failed to testify on the specific disqualifications under Section 4 of the Naturalization Law (e.g., that he is not opposed to organized government, does not teach violence, is not a polygamist, and has no incurable disease) [3]. The witnesses' general statement that Ng would make a "good citizen" was deemed a "mere conclusion unsupported by facts" and an opinion entitled to no weight, citing Rule 123, Section 20 of the Rules of Court [4, 5]. Furthermore, the Court held that the applicant's own testimony regarding the absence of disqualifications is insufficient standing alone; the law requires support by the affidavits of at least two credible citizens [6, 7]. This rule applies with "greater strictness" in cases where the declaration of intention is not required (due to 30-year residence), as it prevents a thorough investigation by the government [7, 8].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is reversed, and the petition is dismissed [9].
