I. CAPTION
CLEMENCIA B. VDA. DE VILLONGCO, ET AL. v. HON. FLORENCIO MORENO and BENIGNO MUSNI, G.R. No. L-17240, January 31, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Villongco is the owner of a fishpond in Macabebe, Pampanga. Following a complaint by Senator Rogelio de la Rosa regarding the appropriation of coastal waters known as "Pantion," the Secretary of Public Works and Communications (Respondent) conducted an investigation [1]. A relocation survey revealed that Villongco’s dikes enclosed approximately 24,860 square meters of Manila Bay, which is outside the boundaries of her Torrens Title and is considered public coastal water [2, 3]. Consequently, Respondent ordered the removal of the encroaching works under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 2056 [4].

Villongco filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, arguing the order was void. The CFI granted the petition and issued an injunction, ruling that Villongco’s constructions fell under the exemption in Section 2 of R.A. No. 2056 because they were built in good faith before the area was declared a communal fishing ground and did not cause inundation [5, 6]. Respondent appealed to the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the fishpond constructions on coastal waters are exempt from removal under Section 2 of R.A. No. 2056.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. Under R.A. No. 2056, the Secretary of Public Works is authorized to order the removal of works encroaching upon "public navigable river, stream, coastal waters and any other public navigable waters or waterways" [6, 8]. The Court held that the exemption provided in Section 2 of the Act applies **only** to works constructed on "communal fishing grounds," and does not extend to constructions on "coastal waters or public waterways" [9].

The Court reasoned that the statutory exception requires that the works "do not obstruct or impede the free passage of any navigable river... or would not cause inundations" [8]. Since "no inundation or free passage of any navigable river can take place on the coastal waters," such waters are not within the contemplation of the exception [9]. The disputed area, being part of Manila Bay and navigable at high and low tide, is public property used as a waterway and is not susceptible to private appropriation [6].

Decision set aside and petition dismissed [10].
