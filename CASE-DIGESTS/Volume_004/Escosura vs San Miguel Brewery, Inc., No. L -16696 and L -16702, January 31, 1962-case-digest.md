**I. CAPTION**
LUCIANO ESCOSURA, et al. v. SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC., G.R. Nos. L-16696 and L-16702, January 31, 1962, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners were employees of San Miguel Brewery, Inc. (SMB) covered by the Social Security System. Upon falling ill and being confined in hospitals, SMB paid them sick leave pay ranging from 50% to 75% of their wages pursuant to the company's private Health, Welfare and Retirement Plan [1]. Petitioners subsequently claimed sickness benefit allowances under Section 14(a) of the Social Security Act (Republic Act No. 1161) [1]. SMB opposed the claim, arguing that under the law, SSS benefits only begin after "all leaves of absence with pay" are exhausted, and since petitioners received sick leave pay, they were ineligible [2], [3]. The Social Security Commission ruled in favor of the employees, interpreting "with pay" to mean "full pay" [4]. SMB appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N employees receiving partial sick leave pay from their employer are precluded from claiming sickness benefits under the Social Security Act.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Commission's ruling, holding that the phrase "leaves of absence with pay" in Section 14(a) of R.A. 1161 contemplates **full compensation** [4], [6].

The Court reasoned that legislative practice distinguishes between full and partial payment by using appropriate modifiers (e.g., "half pay" in C.A. 647), whereas the unqualified term "with pay" in other laws (e.g., R.A. 679, R.A. 843, Civil Code Art. 1695) is consistently understood to mean full compensation [6], [7], [8]. To accept SMB's interpretation that *any* amount of pay precludes SSS benefits would allow employers to circumvent the law's purpose by granting infinitesimally small benefits (e.g., one centavo), thereby perpetually denying employees their statutory rights [9]. Since petitioners received less than their full wage, they had not exhausted "leaves of absence with pay" as contemplated by the Act.

**Resolution affirmed.** [10]
