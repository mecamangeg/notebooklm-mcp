I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. OSCAR CASTELO, ET AL., accused, HERNANDO J. ABAYA, respondent-appellant**, G.R. No. L-11816, April 23, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On March 19, 1955, while the Monroy murder case involving accused Oscar Castelo was pending decision, news editor Hernando J. Abaya published a story in the *Manila Daily Bulletin* titled "Foil Extortion Try on Castelo" [1, 2]. The article reported that Philippine Constabulary agents were investigating two society matrons for allegedly attempting to extort P100,000 from Castelo to secure his acquittal [2]. The story detailed that the matrons claimed to have seen a draft decision by the presiding judge, Judge Emilio Rilloraza, sentencing Castelo to death, and that the money was needed to change the verdict [3, 4].

Judge Rilloraza cited Abaya for indirect contempt, alleging the publication intended to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration of justice and corrupt the court [5, 6]. Abaya argued that the publication was a fair and true report of an official investigation, protected by the freedom of the press [7]. The trial court found Abaya guilty of indirect contempt and fined him P50.00 [5]. Abaya appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Abaya is liable for indirect contempt of court for publishing the news report.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s decision and acquitted Abaya [8].

The Court ruled that the publication did not constitute indirect contempt. Citing *People v. Alarcon*, the Court held that for a publication to be contemptuous, it must be shown to really impede, interfere with, and embarrass the administration of justice [9]. Here, the news story was a factual appraisal of an extortion attempt—a matter distinct from the merits of the pending murder case—and contained no derogatory comment regarding the trial judge or the pending decision [9].

Furthermore, the Court held that the publication falls within the protection of **freedom of the press** and constitutes a **privileged communication** under **Article 354, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code** [10]. The article was a "fair and true report" of an official investigation by Constabulary agents, made in good faith and without comment [10]. The investigation was not confidential, and the public has a right to be informed on matters of public concern [11]. The doctrine of privileged communication rests upon public policy to ensure the free and unfettered administration of justice and protection of public opinion [12].

**Disposition:** Decision reversed.
