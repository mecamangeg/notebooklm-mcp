I. CAPTION
CASTOR CUSTODIO v. JUDGE PEDRO T. CRISTOBAL, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-12487, January 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Castor Custodio was convicted of malicious mischief by the Justice of the Peace Court of Mabini, Pangasinan. On June 20, 1955, the sentence was promulgated, and he was committed to jail [1, 2]. Two days later, Custodio filed a notice of appeal and was released on bond [2]. However, upon motion by the complainant's counsel, the Justice of the Peace set aside the release and ordered Custodio's recommitment, ruling that he had already begun serving his sentence [2]. Custodio filed a petition for *certiorari* with injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan [2].

The CFI ordered Custodio to amend his petition to include the complainants as parties-respondents pursuant to Section 5, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court [3]. Custodio filed a "manifestation" arguing that such inclusion was unnecessary as the Justice of the Peace and Chief of Police were the only real parties in interest [3, 4]. Consequently, the CFI dismissed the case for failure to comply with the order [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court properly dismissed the petition for *certiorari* for failure to amend the pleading to include the complainants as respondents.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court was "somewhat harsh" in dismissing the case outright without giving the petitioner an opportunity to amend the petition [6, 7].

While the lower court may have been correct that the complainants should be included as respondents under the Rules of Court to sustain the action of the Justice of the Peace, and the petitioner's view to the contrary may have been incorrect, the dismissal on a mere technicality was unjust [4, 7]. The Court observed that Custodio's claim had basis, as he appeared to have been committed merely pending the perfection of his appeal rather than serving his sentence [7]. Dismissing the *certiorari* case would cause him to lose his right to appeal and suffer irreparable damage [7]. Justice demanded that he be allowed to amend his petition rather than suffer an outright dismissal [7].

The order appealed from is set aside, and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings, giving the appellant time to amend his petition [8].
