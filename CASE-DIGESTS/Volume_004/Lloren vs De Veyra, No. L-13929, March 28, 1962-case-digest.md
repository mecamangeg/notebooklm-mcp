I. CAPTION
**JOSE T. LLOREN v. THE HON. JESUS DE VEYRA, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-13929, March 28, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lloren, a Justice of the Peace, received an adverse decision from the Court of First Instance (presided by Respondent Judge De Veyra) on **March 18, 1958** [3, 4]. On **April 2, 1958**, Lloren filed a motion for reconsideration [3, 4]. This motion was denied on April 14, 1958, and Lloren received the copy of the denial order on **April 16, 1958** [3, 4]. The following day, **April 17, 1958**, Lloren filed his appeal bond and written notice of appeal [3, 4].

Judge De Veyra denied the appeal, ruling that it was not perfected within the reglementary period of 15 days [3, 4]. The respondent judge applied the computation method from *Federal Films, Inc. v. Judge of the First Instance of Manila*, calculating that the appeal was filed on the 16th day and was thus one day late [5, 6]. Lloren filed a petition for Mandamus to compel the court to approve the appeal [1, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal was perfected within the reglementary period. [4]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court granted the petition and ordered the respondent court to give course to the appeal [7].

The Court expressly resolved not to follow the ruling in *Federal Films, Inc. v. Judge of the First Instance of Manila* and instead adhered strictly to the rule of computation embodied in **Rule 28** of the Rules of Court (exclude the first day, include the last) [5, 8].

The Court reasoned that since the petitioner filed his motion for reconsideration on the 15th day of the period, that day should be excluded from the count of time consumed [8]. Therefore, when he received the order denying the motion on April 16, he still had **one (1) day** remaining to perfect his appeal [8]. Applying Rule 28 to this remaining period—excluding the day of receipt (April 16) and including the next day (April 17)—the filing of the appeal on April 17, 1958, was timely [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
