**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MIGUEL LASALA, G.R. No. L-12141, January 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
On September 11, 1956, in a cockpit in Surigao, accused Miguel Lasala assaulted Wenceslao Andanar, the incumbent municipal mayor, with fistic blows in the presence of many people [1]. The attack caused injuries requiring 14 days of medical treatment and incapacitated the mayor for 12 days, while allegedly exposing him to public ridicule and dishonor [1]. Lasala was charged with the complex crime of serious slander by deed with less serious physical injuries [1]. Before arraignment, Lasala filed a Motion to Quash, arguing that the acts did not constitute a complex crime under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), but rather the single specific offense defined in Article 265, paragraph 2 of the RPC (less serious physical injuries with manifest intent to insult) [2]. The trial court sustained the motion and ordered the prosecution to amend the information to charge the single offense [2]. The prosecution appealed this order [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the accused should be charged with the complex crime of serious slander by deed with less serious physical injuries under Article 48 of the RPC.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's order requiring the amendment of the information [3]. The Court held that whenever an act inflicts less serious physical injuries with the manifest intent to insult the offended party, or under circumstances adding ignominy to the offense, the offender must be prosecuted under Article 265, paragraph 2 of the RPC [4]. This specific provision acts as an exception to the rule in Article 48 regarding complex crimes [4]. A complex crime only exists where the Code has no specific provision penalizing the composite act with a definite specific penalty [4, 5]. Since the acts alleged—assaulting a mayor in a crowded cockpit—fit squarely within the specific definition and penalty provided in Article 265, paragraph 2, Article 48 cannot apply [6]. The order appealed from is affirmed [3].
