I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. MELQUIADES G. ILAO, PASCUAL M. PEREZ and NICASIA SARMIENTO, G.R. No. L-16667, January 30, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Perez and Sarmiento applied for land registration of parcels within the Bicol National Park. The Republic objected, arguing the land was public domain. While the case was pending, respondents obtained a Certificate of Private Woodland Registration from the Bureau of Forestry and began logging. The Republic filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and injunction (Civil Case No. 1140) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Norte to annul the certificate and stop the logging.

Respondents filed a Motion to Dismiss the petition. Before the respondents filed an answer, the Republic filed an Amended Petition to supplement the original and claim damages. The respondent Judge Ilao dismissed the original petition and later denied the Republic's motion for reconsideration. The Judge refused to admit the Amended Petition, ruling it was a "mere scrap of paper" because it was filed without leave of court after the Motion to Dismiss had been served and submitted for resolution. The Republic filed the present special civil action for certiorari and mandamus with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner may amend its complaint as a matter of right after a motion to dismiss is filed but before an answer is served.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Under Section 1, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court (now Rule 10), a party may amend his pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served. The Supreme Court held that a motion to dismiss is not a responsive pleading (*Paeste vs. Jaurige*). Since the Republic filed the Amended Petition before the respondents filed an answer to the original petition, the amendment was a matter of right. The respondent Court committed grave abuse of discretion in treating the Amended Petition as a "scrap of paper" and unlawfully excluding the petitioner from the enjoyment of a statutory right. Mandamus lies to compel the respondent Court to admit the Amended Petition.

Petition granted.
