I. CAPTION
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. DELGADO BROTHERS, INC., G.R. No. L-15156, March 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On January 24, 1957, petitioner Insurance Company of North America filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against respondent Delgado Brothers, Inc., the arrastre contractor for the Port of Manila, to recover P368.38 [1]. This amount represented the value of a short-delivery of 14.3 kilograms of dental cream flavor shipped from New York to Manila [1]. The shipment was unloaded from the *SS Fernfield* and placed in the custody of respondent, who subsequently delivered it to the broker short of the stated quantity [1]. Petitioner paid the consignee's insurance claim and demanded reimbursement from respondent [1]. Respondent moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the suit was not an admiralty action and, given the amount involved, fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Municipal Court [2]. The CFI dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the complaint against the arrastre operator is one in admiralty jurisdiction.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the case does not deal with maritime matters or the administration of maritime law [3, 4]. The Court held that the respondent's duty as an arrastre operator and custodian of discharged goods is merely that of an "ordinary depositary" [3]. To be considered an admiralty case, the contract "must relate to the trade and business of the sea" and must be "essentially and fully maritime in its character" [5, 6]. Since the suit was not maritime in nature and the claim of P368.38 was below the jurisdictional amount for the CFI, the lower court correctly dismissed the action [2, 4].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS (if any)
None.
