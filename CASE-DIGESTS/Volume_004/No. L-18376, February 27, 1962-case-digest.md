I. CAPTION
SY IT v. ARSENIO TIANGCO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18376, February 27, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Arsenio Tiangco and Bola Singh Pabla filed separate ejectment complaints against Ang Yee King and petitioner Sy It in the Municipal Court of Manila. Instead of answering, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied. Without filing a motion for reconsideration, both defendants filed a single joint petition for certiorari in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila through their respective counsels, Enrico I. de la Cruz and Jordan Techico. The CFI dismissed the petition on February 11, 1959.

A copy of the decision was served on Atty. de la Cruz on February 17, 1959. The petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration only on March 12, 1959, or 23 days after receipt. Sy It argued that the decision had not become final as to him because his specific counsel, Atty. Techico, was not served with the decision, and service was only made to Atty. de la Cruz. The CFI eventually declared the decision final as to Ang Yee King but not as to Sy It. However, upon appeal to the Supreme Court, the timeliness of the appeal and the validity of the service were questioned.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N service of the decision upon one of the counsels in a jointly filed petition constitutes valid service upon the other petitioner.
2. W/N a petition for certiorari is proper without first filing a motion for reconsideration in the lower court.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that where litigants jointly file a petition and are represented jointly by their counsel, service upon one of the latter is deemed service upon the other. The record showed that the petition for certiorari was jointly filed by both petitioners who were represented jointly by attorneys De la Cruz and Techico. Furthermore, the motion for reconsideration was signed by Atty. de la Cruz on behalf of Atty. Techico. Since the motion for reconsideration was filed 23 days after Atty. de la Cruz received the decision, the decision had already become final and executory. Consequently, the trial court lost jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the original petition for certiorari was fatally defective. Before an aggrieved party can file a petition for certiorari, they must first give the trial court an opportunity to correct the error it may have committed through a motion for reconsideration. In this case, Sy It immediately filed a petition for certiorari after the Municipal Court denied his motion to dismiss, without first seeking reconsideration. This ground alone was sufficient basis for dismissal.

The appeal is **DISMISSED**.
