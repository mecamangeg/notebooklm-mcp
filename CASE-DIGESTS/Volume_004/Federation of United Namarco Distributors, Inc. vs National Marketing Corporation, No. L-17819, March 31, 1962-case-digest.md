I. CAPTION
FEDERATION OF UNITED NAMARCO DISTRIBUTORS, INC., ET AL. v. NATIONAL MARKETING CORPORATION / NATIONAL MARKETING CORPORATION v. HON. BIENVENIDO TAN, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-17819 & L-17768, March 31, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
In 1959, to address rising prices and a strike paralyzing the National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO), the President approved a plan for distributor associations to import goods directly. The Federation of United Namarco Distributors, Inc. (Federation) petitioned for such trade assistance, which NAMARCO’s Board approved via Resolution No. 524 [1-3]. A Contract of Sale was executed on November 16, 1959 [4]. Subsequently, the Board passed Resolution No. 530, prohibiting "forward sales" and requiring distribution to regular outlets [5]. Upon the Auditor’s inquiry regarding the conflict between the resolutions, the Board passed Resolution No. 14, approving the contract "subject to" the terms of Resolutions 524 and 530 [6].

The Federation paid over P2.4 million, and NAMARCO accepted payments and released partial deliveries [7]. However, a new Board later stopped deliveries, alleging the contract was invalid for lack of proper approval and violation of Administrative Order No. 290 [8, 9]. The Federation filed a suit for specific performance (Civil Case No. 42684). The trial court ruled in favor of the Federation and subsequently granted a special order for execution pending appeal due to the perishable nature of the goods and public calamity [10, 11]. NAMARCO appealed the decision (L-17819) and filed a petition for certiorari against the execution order (L-17768) [12, 13].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Contract of Sale is valid and binding on NAMARCO.
2. W/N NAMARCO is liable for storage charges and the spoilage of goods (oranges).
3. W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the order of execution pending appeal.
4. W/N the award of attorney's fees was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The contract is binding. The Board's Resolution No. 14 expressly approved the contract. To interpret the proviso subjecting it to Resolution No. 530 as a negation of that approval would imply a gross inconsistency and render the Board's act meaningless. Under Article 1373 of the Civil Code, stipulations must be interpreted to render them effectual [14-16]. Additionally, the prohibition on "forward sales" applied to distribution to retailers, not the importation itself, and the Federation's members were admitted regular outlets [17]. Finally, NAMARCO's acceptance of partial payments constituted an implied ratification of the contract, precluding it from rejecting its binding effect [18-20]. Administrative Order No. 290 does not apply to contracts for special purposes authorized by the President to meet emergencies [18, 19, 21].

2. **YES.** NAMARCO must bear the loss. The spoilage of the oranges occurred because NAMARCO refused to deliver them despite the Federation's willingness to accept delivery; thus, the loss falls on the party at fault [22-24]. Similarly, while the contract assigned storage costs to the Federation, charges accruing during the delay caused by NAMARCO's refusal to deliver must be borne by NAMARCO under Articles 1169 and 1170 of the Civil Code [23, 25, 26].

3. **NO.** The trial court acted within its discretion under Rule 39, Section 2. It stated good reasons for special execution: the goods were perishable, their immediate marketing would benefit the public during a calamity, and NAMARCO's appeal appeared frivolous [27-29]. Grave abuse of discretion requires a capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment, which was not present here [25, 30, 31].

4. **NO.** To justify an award of attorney's fees, the trial court must state the factual or legal reason for such an award in the text of the decision itself, which the lower court failed to do [25, 30].

ACCORDINGLY, the decision in G.R. No. L-17819 is AFFIRMED with the modification that the award of attorney's fees is eliminated. The petition in G.R. No. L-17768 is DENIED, and the preliminary injunction is dissolved [32].
