I. CAPTION
ROBERTO LAPERAL, JR. and PURIFICACION M. LAPERAL v. RAMON L. KATIGBAK and EVELINA KALAW-KATIGBAK, G.R. No. L-16951, February 28, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Roberto and Purificacion Laperal previously sued spouses Ramon and Evelina Katigbak in Civil Case No. 11767 to collect P14,000 and P97,500 based on promissory notes and jewelry receipts signed by Ramon [1, 2]. The Supreme Court, in G.R. No. L-4299 (1952), dismissed the case against Evelina because she did not sign the notes and the complaint failed to allege the obligations redounded to the family's benefit; Ramon, however, confessed judgment [2, 3].

Subsequently, the Laperals filed a second action (Civil Case No. 25235) against the spouses, seeking to annul the spouses' judicial separation of property and to hold the fruits of Evelina's paraphernal property liable for the judgment against Ramon [2, 4, 5]. Evelina raised the defense of *res judicata*, citing the dismissal in the first case [6]. The trial court, after a remand from the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-11418 (which held that conjugal properties could be liable), sentenced Evelina to pay one-half of the judgment [1, 7, 8]. Evelina appealed, arguing the second action is barred by the final judgment in the first case [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the second action against the wife to make the fruits of her paraphernal property liable is barred by the prior judgment dismissing the first collection suit against her.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the trial court's order and absolved Evelina Katigbak.

The Court ruled that the second action is barred by former judgment under Section 44, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court [10]. The claim in the first case (Civil Case No. 11767) was to make Evelina liable for the obligations signed by her husband, whether personally or through her properties [11]. Under the rule against multiplicity of suits (Section 3, Rule 2), a party is prohibited from dividing a cause of action or pursuing different remedies for the same demand in separate suits [12, 13]. A plaintiff cannot sue a wife personally in one suit and then, after failing, sue to make the fruits of her paraphernal property liable in a subsequent suit for the exact same debt [13, 14].

The prior judgment is conclusive not only on matters actually presented but also on every ground of recovery that *might* have been presented [11]. Furthermore, the Court’s previous decision in G.R. No. L-11418 remanding the case did not constitute a waiver of the *res judicata* defense because, under the rule of conclusiveness of judgment (Section 45, Rule 39), only matters *actually decided* are binding; since the Court did not rule on the bar by former judgment in that appeal, it remained a valid defense [15-17].

The order appealed from is set aside and the defendant is absolved from the action [18].
