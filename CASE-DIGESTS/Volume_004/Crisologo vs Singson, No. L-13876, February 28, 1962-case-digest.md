I. CAPTION
CONSOLACION FLORENTINO DE CRISOLOGO, ET AL. v. DR. MANUEL SINGSON, G.R. No. L-13876, February 28, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Dña. Leona Singson died single on January 13, 1948, leaving a will that was admitted to probate [1]. Clause IX of her will bequeathed one-half of a residential lot in Vigan to her grandniece, plaintiff Consolacion Florentino [2, 3]. The clause further stated that if Consolacion died before or after the testatrix, the property would be given in equal parts to the testatrix's three brothers (Evaristo, Manuel, and Dionisio) or their forced heirs [3].

Consolacion and her husband filed an action for partition against the defendant, Manuel Singson, regarding the property [2]. Manuel refused, arguing that under Clause IX, Consolacion was merely a usufructuary and not the owner of the one-half pro-indiviso share [4]. He contended the clause created a *sustitucion fideicomisaria* (fideicommissary substitution), where Consolacion was obliged to preserve the property for the brothers [4]. The lower court ruled in favor of Consolacion, declaring her a co-owner and ordering partition [4]. Manuel appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the testamentary clause constituted a *sustitucion fideicomisaria* (fideicommissary substitution).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's judgment, holding that the will established a mere *sustitucion vulgar* (simple substitution) [5].

The Court applied the provisions of the old Civil Code (in force at the time of the testatrix's death in 1948) [6]. Under Article 781 and established jurisprudence, a *sustitucion fideicomisaria* requires three elements: (1) a first heir called to enjoy the property; (2) an obligation clearly imposed upon the first heir to preserve and transmit the property to a third person; and (3) a second heir [7].

The Court found that Clause IX did not expressly impose an obligation upon Consolacion to preserve and transmit the property ("conservar y transmitir") to the brothers [8, 9]. The clause merely provided that upon her death, the property would belong to the testatrix's brothers [9]. Without the clear absolute obligation to deliver the property to the second heir, the substitution is not fideicommissary [8, 10]. Consequently, Consolacion became the owner of the undivided half upon the testatrix's death, not a mere usufructuary, and was entitled to partition [11].

Judgment affirmed [12].
