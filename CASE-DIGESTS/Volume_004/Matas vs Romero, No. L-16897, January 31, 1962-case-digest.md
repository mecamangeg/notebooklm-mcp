I. CAPTION
GREGORIO M. MATAS v. THE HON. HONORIO ROMERO, Judge of the Court of First Instance, Branch III, Davao, and Isidro Ordaneza, G.R. No. L-16897, January 31, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
In the November 10, 1959 elections for municipal officials in Padada, Davao, Gregorio M. Matas was proclaimed mayor. His opponent, Isidro Ordaneza, filed an election protest covering several precincts, alleging frauds and irregularities. Matas filed an answer denying the allegations and a counter-protest limited specifically to Precinct No. 15.

During the proceedings, after the revision of the first eight precincts, Ordaneza moved to waive and renounce his right to the revision of the remaining 12 precincts included in his original protest, opting to rely on the results of the precincts already revised. Matas opposed this, demanding that the ballot boxes of the remaining 12 precincts be opened and revised, despite not having included them in his counter-protest. The trial court granted Ordaneza's motion to withdraw the precincts and dismissed the protest as regards to them. Matas filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the protestee may demand the revision of ballots in precincts originally included in the election protest but subsequently withdrawn by the protestant, when the protestee failed to include said precincts in his counter-protest.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the petition. The Court ruled that the right of a protestee to demand revision is limited to the precincts he specifically included in his counter-protest, pursuant to Section 176(c) of the Revised Election Code.

The Court explained that to permit the revision of precincts not subject to a pending protest (due to withdrawal) or counter-protest would allow a party to conduct a "fishing expedition," unduly prolong the contest, and frustrate the will of the electorate. A protestant has the right to withdraw precincts from his protest to simplify issues and facilitate the prompt termination of the case. Since Matas did not allege irregularities in the 12 precincts in his counter-protest, he cannot demand their revision after the protestant waived them. The Court further noted that Section 175, regarding *motu proprio* revision in the "interest of justice," applies when the court desires further examination, which was not the case here as the trial court refused the revision.

Petition denied.
