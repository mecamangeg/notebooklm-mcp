**I. CAPTION**
TAN TIONG BIO, ET AL. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-15778, April 23, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
On July 5, 1946, Dee Hong Lue purchased surplus goods (the "Mystery Pile") from the Foreign Liquidation Commission (FLC). On October 19, 1946, Central Syndicate (Syndicate), a corporation, informed the Collector of Internal Revenue that it had purchased the goods from Dee Hong Lue and assumed his tax liability, depositing an amount for sales tax. The Collector investigated and determined that Dee Hong Lue purchased the goods merely as an agent for the Syndicate, making the Syndicate the true importer and original seller liable for percentage taxes. The Collector assessed a deficiency sales tax of P33,797.88 plus surcharge.

The Syndicate appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). During the pendency of the case, the Syndicate's corporate term expired. The CTA initially dismissed the case for lack of personality, but the Supreme Court (in a previous resolution, G.R. No. L-8800) ordered the substitution of the Syndicate's officers and directors (petitioners Tan Tiong Bio, et al.) as parties. The CTA then affirmed the Collector's assessment and ordered the petitioners to pay the deficiency tax "jointly and severally." Petitioners appealed, arguing the Syndicate was not the importer, the tax had prescribed, and they could not be held liable for the dissolved corporation's debts.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N Central Syndicate was the importer of the surplus goods liable for sales tax.
2. W/N the assessment of the deficiency tax had prescribed.
3. W/N the petitioners (officers/stockholders) can be held liable for the tax liability of the dissolved corporation.
4. W/N the petitioners’ liability is solidary.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Central Syndicate was the importer. The evidence showed that Dee Hong Lue purchased the goods acting as a trustee or agent for the Syndicate, which was then in the process of incorporation. The Syndicate eventually took delivery and removed the goods from the U.S. Military Base. Under Section 186 of the Revenue Code (prior to R.A. No. 594), the person who buys surplus goods from the FLC and removes them from the military base is considered the importer subject to sales tax.

2. **NO.** The Syndicate failed to file its quarterly returns as required by Section 183 of the Tax Code. The letter sent in 1946 did not constitute a return for the Syndicate. Consequently, the applicable prescriptive period is 10 years after the discovery of the falsity, fraud, or omission pursuant to Section 332 of the Tax Code. The Collector discovered the omission on September 12, 1951, and the assessment made on January 4, 1952, was well within the period.

3. **YES.** The creditor of a dissolved corporation may follow its assets once they pass into the hands of the stockholders. The dissolution of a corporation does not extinguish debts due to it or owing by it. The government has the right to assess and collect taxes due from a defunct corporation from persons who, by reason of transactions with the corporation, hold property against which the tax can be enforced. The petitioners, having received the distributed assets (net profits) of the Syndicate upon liquidation, are liable.

4. **NO.** The Supreme Court modified the CTA decision regarding the nature of the liability. There is no express provision requiring stockholders of a dissolved corporation to be solidarily liable for its debts. Solidary liability cannot be presumed. Therefore, the petitioners are liable for the tax **only in proportion to their shares in the distribution of the assets** of the defunct corporation.

**The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION regarding the non-solidary liability of the petitioners.**
