**I. CAPTION**
DR. ANTONIO A. LIZARES, INC. v. HON. HERMOGENES CALUAG, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Quezon City, and FLAVIANO CACNIO, G.R. No. L-17699, March 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
On April 20, 1955, respondent Flaviano Cacnio purchased Lot 4, Block 1 of the Sinkang Subdivision in Bacolod City from petitioner Dr. Antonio A. Lizares, Inc. on an installment basis. On March 25, 1960, the petitioner demanded payment of P7,324.69 for arrears, interest, and taxes. Cacnio claimed he only owed P5,824.69 and tendered a check for that amount, which the petitioner refused.

Cacnio filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, Quezon City Branch, praying that the petitioner be ordered to accept the payment, pay damages, and be enjoined from repossessing the lot [1, 2]. The petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing venue was improperly laid because the action affected title to or possession of real property located in Bacolod City. The CFI denied the motion, ruling the action was *in personam*. The petitioner filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of Appeals, which was dismissed [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the action to compel acceptance of payment for a lot affects title to real property such that venue must be laid where the property is located.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while the immediate remedy sought by Cacnio was to compel the petitioner to accept the tender of payment, this relief was merely the first step to establish his title to the real property. Furthermore, the complaint was a means to retain possession of the property [4, 5]. Therefore, the case falls under Section 3 of Rule 5 of the Rules of Court, which mandates that actions affecting title to, or for recovery of possession of, real property shall be commenced and tried in the province where the property or any part thereof lies [6].

The venue was improperly laid in Quezon City. The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the respondent Judge is directed to desist from taking further cognizance of the case [7].
