I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RODOLFO SANTOS and RURAL INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-17887, April 28, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On April 2, 1959, accused Rodolfo Santos failed to appear for his trial. The trial court immediately ordered his arrest and the confiscation of the P7,500.00 bail bond posted by appellant Rural Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. The court granted the surety 30 days to produce the accused and explain why the bond should not be forfeited. The surety failed to comply within the period, filing a motion for extension only on May 26, 1959, more than 20 days after the deadline. Consequently, the court rendered a final judgment of forfeiture on June 11, 1959.

The surety surrendered the accused on July 20, 1959, and moved to lift the confiscation or reduce the amount. The trial court reduced the liability to one-half of the original bond. The surety appealed to the Court of Appeals (later certified to the Supreme Court), arguing that the liability should be reduced to a nominal amount of P200.00 because it exerted diligent efforts to locate the accused.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the surety is entitled to a further reduction of the forfeited bond to a nominal amount.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court found no valid reason to interfere with the discretion of the lower court. The Court held that the trial court was justified in declining to reduce the forfeiture to a nominal amount because the surety failed to explain satisfactorily the accused's non-appearance.

The surety displayed a lack of diligence by: (1) failing to offer an explanation or produce the accused within the 30-day period granted by the court; and (2) failing to ensure the accused's appearance on the day of trial. The surety's excuse—that it sent an employee to fetch the accused only to find him gone—demonstrated that it did not take sufficient measures to guarantee the defendant's appearance.

Judgment affirmed.
