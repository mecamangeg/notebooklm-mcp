I. CAPTION
CORNELIO ALZONA, ET AL. v. GREGORIA CAPUNITAN and MANUEL REYES, G.R. No. L-10228, February 28, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Arcadio Alomia and Ildefonsa Almeda owned two registered parcels of land (Lots 2968 and 2524) in Biñan, Laguna. Arcadio died in 1924 without issue. Ildefonsa, claiming to be the sole heir, adjudicated the properties to herself and obtained titles in her name, excluding Arcadio's collateral relatives (Plaintiffs). She later sold the lots to Defendants (her niece and niece's husband), who purchased them with knowledge that the properties were conjugal.

Plaintiffs filed an action for recovery of the lots on January 28, 1950. The Court of Appeals found that Ildefonsa held Arcadio's share in implied trust for Plaintiffs and that Defendants bought the land subject to this trust. However, the case was remanded to determine if prescription applied. The lower court subsequently dismissed the complaint, ruling that the action had prescribed because Plaintiffs had previously filed suits in 1928 and 1931, which indicated Defendants' repudiation of the trust, and no interruption of the prescription period occurred. Plaintiffs appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for reconveyance based on implied trust has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that while Section 46 of the Land Registration Act provides that no title to registered land in derogation of the registered owner shall be acquired by prescription, this protection applies only to registered owners [1]. Plaintiffs were not the registered owners.

The sale to Defendants created an implied or constructive trust [2]. Under jurisprudence, actions for reconveyance based on implied or constructive trust prescribe in ten (10) years (*Boñaga v. Soler*; *J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. v. Magdangal*) [2]. The filing of previous suits by Plaintiffs in 1928 and 1931 revealed that Defendants had consistently repudiated the trust [3]. Since the 1950 complaint was filed well beyond the ten-year period from such repudiation, the action is barred. Furthermore, Defendants, having repudiated the trust and claimed ownership, acquired the properties by prescription (*Tolentino v. Vitug*) [4].

**Decision affirmed.**
