I. CAPTION
INDUSTRIAL-COMMERCIAL-AGRICULTURAL WORKERS ORGANIZATION (ICAWO), et al. v. CENTRAL AZUCARERA DE PILAR, et al., G.R. No. L-17422, February 28, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, employees of Central Azucarera de Pilar, were originally members of the Allied Workers' Association (AWA), which later reorganized as CAPAWA. In October 1955, CAPAWA and the Central entered into a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) containing a "union-shop" clause. Subsequently, petitioners organized a rival union, ICAWO, and demanded recognition. CAPAWA demanded the enforcement of the union-shop clause, insisting on the dismissal of petitioners for refusing to reaffiliate with CAPAWA. The Central dismissed the petitioners, leading to a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled in favor of the respondents, holding that the CBA empowered CAPAWA to demand the dismissal of members who lost their good standing.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the "union-shop" clause in the CBA authorized the dismissal of old employees who joined a different union.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the agreement did not establish a true or complete "closed-shop" that authorized the dismissal of members who ceased to be members after the execution of the contract. For an employer to be bound to dismiss employees for non-union membership, the stipulation must be "clear and unequivocal," leaving no room for doubt [1]. Such undertakings are harsh and must be strictly construed against the existence of a closed-shop [1].

The specific clause in question expressly referred only to "hiring unskilled employees" and "new employees and laborers," stating they must become members of CAPAWA within 30 days [2, 3]. It contained no provision regarding old employees already in the service of the Central, nor did it require union members to remain as such under pain of dismissal [4]. Relying on *Confederated Sons of Labor v. Anakan Lumber Company*, the Court ruled that membership in the union was not a condition for the retention of laborers engaged before the agreement [4, 5].

The petition was granted. The decision of the CIR was reversed, and the Central was ordered to reinstate the petitioners to their former positions [6].
