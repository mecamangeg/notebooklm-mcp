**I. CAPTION**
FRANCO J. ALTOMONTE v. PHILIPPINE-AMERICAN DRUG COMPANY, G.R. No. L-16804, April 28, 1962, Padilla, J. [1]

**II. FACTS**
The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu originally rendered judgment ordering the defendant company to pay Altomonte a 1% commission on gross sales amounting to P3,283.87, with legal interest from the filing of the complaint [2]. On appeal (G.R. Nos. L-11872 and L-14922), the Supreme Court modified the decision, increasing the commission to P5,042.37 but striking out other awards for damages and separation pay [3-5]. The dispositive portion of the Supreme Court's decision read: "As thus modified, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the defendant," without explicitly mentioning the legal interest originally awarded by the trial court [5, 6].

When Altomonte moved for execution, the defendant objected, arguing that the Supreme Court's modificatory judgment fixed the liability at the exact sum of P5,042.37 and excluded legal interest because it was not expressly restated in the High Court's decision [7, 8]. The trial court issued a writ of execution including the legal interest, prompting the defendant to appeal [9].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the writ of execution properly included legal interest even if the Supreme Court's modificatory judgment was silent on the matter. [10]

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that where an appealed judgment is affirmed with modification, those parts of the lower court's ruling that the appellate court does not expressly reverse, alter, or modify stand affirmed [11, 12].

In the previous decision, the Supreme Court did not state that legal interest was excluded from the judgment under review. Consequently, the original award of legal interest by the trial court remained in force by virtue of the statement: "As thus modified, the judgment appealed from is affirmed." The trial court's order of execution was correct in including the interest [12].

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [12].
