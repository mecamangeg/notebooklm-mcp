I. CAPTION
EMILIANA EMPAMANO, ET AL. v. THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, G.R. No. L-14106, January 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On October 2, 1954, Emiliana Empamano and her children (heirs of Marciano Jovellana) filed an application for original registration of two parcels of land in San Narciso, Quezon. They presented evidence of open, continuous, and adverse possession in the concept of owner dating back to the Spanish period through their predecessors-in-interest [1-3].

The Director of Lands opposed the application, arguing that the applicants were estopped from claiming ownership. The opposition relied on the fact that on February 17, 1953, Emiliana had filed a sales application with the Bureau of Lands for one of the parcels [4]. Paragraph 6 of said application contained a statement recognizing the land as public domain and relinquishing rights to the government. However, this clause included a specific insertion stating that the waiver applied "if this application is approved; otherwise, I shall apply for Torrens title to this land" [4]. The Bureau of Lands had taken no action on the sales application [5]. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of the applicants, granting registration [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the applicant is estopped from judicially registering the land due to a prior sales application acknowledging the land as public domain.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the appellant's contention is untenable. A reading of the sales application discloses that whatever admission and waiver Emiliana Empamano made regarding the public character of the land were expressly conditional—they depended upon the government's approval of her application [6]. Since the application had not been approved or disapproved at the time the court decided the case, no admission or waiver can be said to have been made [6, 7].

Furthermore, the statement in the application clearly reserved her right to apply for a Torrens title if the sales application was not approved [6]. Additionally, even if the waiver were absolute, it would bind only Emiliana and not her children, as there was no evidence they authorized her to make such a waiver [8].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [8].
