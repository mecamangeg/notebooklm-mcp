I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE LAND-AIR-SEA LABOR UNION (PLASLU) v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and CEBU PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY, G.R. No. L-15984, March 30, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner PLASLU filed a motion seeking the reinstatement of Marieta Tapia, a receptionist at respondent Cebu Portland Cement Company (CEPOC). PLASLU argued that under a prior judgment in CIR Case No. 241-V, employees who had worked for three months were to be made permanent if hired for permanent positions [1]. CEPOC countered that Tapia was appointed temporarily for a fixed period under Section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code because she lacked civil service eligibility [2]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) dismissed the motion, ruling that Tapia's appointment was for a fixed term and thus not covered by the reinstatement judgment [3]. PLASLU appealed, arguing inter alia that Tapia should be retained to qualify for automatic civil service eligibility [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the application of Civil Service Law to government-owned corporations infringes upon the Magna Carta of Labor or the Termination of Employment Act.
2. W/N Tapia is entitled to permanent status or reinstatement.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The application of the Civil Service Law, rules, and regulations to government-owned or controlled corporations does not infringe upon the Magna Carta of Labor (R.A. 875) or the Termination of Employment Act (R.A. 1052, as amended). The Civil Service Law and these labor laws can stand together [5]. The philosophy of the Civil Service Law is to engage only those who are fit and meritorious, thereby minimizing favoritism and serving the public welfare [5].

2. **NO.** The CIR judgment relied upon by PLASLU only covered employees hired intentionally for permanent positions; it expressly excluded those hired for a specified period [6]. Tapia's employment was for a fixed period of three months, making her ineligible for the permanency decreed in the prior case [6]. Furthermore, she cannot invoke automatic civil service eligibility under R.A. No. 186, as this requires at least ten years of continuous service, and Tapia had served for only four years [4, 7].

The orders under review are affirmed [7].
