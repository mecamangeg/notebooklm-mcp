I. CAPTION
JUAN BEATRIZ, ET AL. v. MARTIN CEDERIA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17703, February 28, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
The land in question was sold by Isaac Papa to the plaintiffs (Juan Beatriz, et al.) and their sister Maria Beatriz (wife of defendant Martin Cederia) on April 19, 1937, via a deed of sale (Exhibit A) which was registered in the Registry of Deeds [1, 2]. The vendees possessed the land in common [1]. Later, plaintiffs demanded partition, but defendants refused, claiming exclusive ownership based on a deed of sale dated November 4, 1947 (Exhibit 3) executed by Isaac Papa in favor of Martin Cederia, which was never registered [3, 4]. Papa testified that Cederia procured his signature on Exhibit 3 through misrepresentation [2, 5].

The lower court ruled in favor of plaintiffs, ordering partition [6, 7]. Defendants’ counsel failed to appeal within the reglementary period [7]. Defendants filed a petition for relief of judgment, alleging that their counsel's failure to inform them of the decision constituted fraud, accident, mistake, and excusable negligence [7, 8]. The lower court denied the motion [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the motion for relief of judgment based on counsel's negligence should be granted.
2. W/N the plaintiffs have a better right to the property under the rules on double sale.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the allegation of fraud and negligence was a mere conclusion unsupported by facts [10]. Furthermore, it is a well-settled rule that a party is bound by the acts of his counsel, even if the latter had been negligent in the discharge of his duties [10, 11].

2. **YES.** Under Article 1544 of the Civil Code regarding double sale of immovable property, ownership belongs to the person who in good faith first recorded it in the Registry of Property [4, 12]. The Court noted that plaintiffs’ deed (Exhibit A) was executed in 1937 and registered, while defendants’ deed (Exhibit 3) was executed ten years later and remained unregistered [4]. Plaintiffs' good faith in registering was not disputed; thus, their claim must be upheld [4, 13].

The orders appealed from are affirmed [14, 15].
