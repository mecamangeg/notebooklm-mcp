I. CAPTION
SALVACION FERIA VDA. DE POTENCIANO v. WILLIAM GRUENBERG, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16956, February 27, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On September 21, 1959, plaintiff Salvacion Feria Vda. de Potenciano filed a case in the Court of First Instance of Manila to enforce a judgment dated August 12, 1949, rendered in a prior case (*Philippine National Bank v. Gruenberg*). The 1949 judgment ordered defendant William Gruenberg to pay unpaid rentals and liquidated damages. Gruenberg opposed the enforcement, alleging that the 1949 proceedings were void because he and his counsel lacked valid notice of the hearing. He further argued that the action to enforce the judgment had prescribed.

The trial court found that Gruenberg's counsel, whose motion to withdraw had been denied, was present during the 1949 trial. It also found that Gruenberg was served a copy of the 1949 decision on August 21, 1949. The trial court ruled in favor of Potenciano. Gruenberg appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action to enforce the judgment has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the action was filed within the prescriptive period. Under Section 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure, an action upon a judgment must be brought within ten years after the right of action accrues. The Court established that neither the date of the decision nor the date of its service determines the commencement of this period. Instead, the right of action accrues only when the judgment becomes **final and executory**, as this is the moment the judgment becomes enforceable in a court of justice.

Here, Gruenberg received the decision on August 21, 1949. Since no appeal was perfected within the 30-day period, the judgment became final and executory on September 21, 1949. Consequently, the 10-year period to enforce the judgment expired on September 20, 1959. However, because September 20, 1959, fell on a Sunday, the action filed on the next day, September 21, 1959, was timely. The Court also rejected Gruenberg's claim of lack of notice, affirming the lower court's findings that his counsel was present at the trial and that he was properly served the decision. The appeal was denied.
