I. CAPTION
BEATRIZ GALANG v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS, MAXIMO QUINIT and RODRIGO QUINIT, G.R. No. L-17248, January 29, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Beatriz Galang and respondent Rodrigo Quinit were engaged, but Rodrigo's parents were opposed to the marriage. From April 1955, they lived together as husband and wife in Colorado Falls, Tuba, Mountain Province, until Rodrigo left on May 9, 1955, and never returned [1]. Galang filed a suit for damages for breach of promise to marry against Rodrigo and his father, Maximo Quinit [2]. The Court of First Instance of Baguio ordered both defendants jointly and severally to pay actual damages, P5,000.00 moral damages, and attorney's fees [2]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision regarding Maximo Quinit, absolving him after finding the evidence of his participation unworthy of credence, and modified the decision regarding Rodrigo by eliminating the moral damages and attorney's fees [2], [3]. Galang filed a petition for certiorari, questioning the CA's findings of fact and the removal of moral damages.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court may review the Court of Appeals' findings on the credibility of evidence regarding Maximo Quinit.
2. W/N moral damages are recoverable for breach of promise to marry.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The findings of the Court of Appeals on the credibility of evidence are beyond the power of review of the Supreme Court on appeals by certiorari. Such findings are consequently conclusive upon the Supreme Court [4], [3].

2. **NO.** Moral damages for breach of promise to marry are not collectible under Philippine laws [5]. The Court applied the doctrine previously settled in *Hermosisima vs. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. L-14628, September 30, 1960) [6], [5].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [5].
