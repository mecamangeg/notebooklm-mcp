I. CAPTION
ANTONIO RAGUDO and EUGENIA PAREDES v. EMELITA R. PASNO, represented by her Father, ENRIQUE R. PASNO as her guardian ad-litem, G.R. No. L-16642, April 18, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On October 12, 1959, spouses Antonio Ragudo and Eugenia Paredes filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon to annul a final order of the Justice of the Peace (JP) of Tayabas dated July 31, 1959, which declared the minor Emelita R. Pasno as their adopted child [1]. The spouses alleged that Emelita's father, Enrique Pasno, obtained the adoption decree through fraud and misrepresentation by inducing them to believe the proceedings were merely to transfer Antonio's guerilla educational benefits to the child, without any intent to adopt [1, 2].

The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that since Justice of the Peace courts have concurrent jurisdiction with Courts of First Instance over adoption cases, the CFI lacked jurisdiction to interfere with or annul the JP's order [2]. The CFI upheld this contention and dismissed the case [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to annul a final order of adoption issued by a Justice of the Peace court allegedly obtained through fraud.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while Justice of the Peace courts have jurisdiction over adoption cases pursuant to Republic Acts 643 and 644, the present suit is not an adoption case but a civil action to annul an order allegedly obtained through fraud [3].

Citing Section 43 of Act 190 and the rulings in *Garchitorena v. Sotelo* and *Quion v. Claridad*, the Court ruled that Justice of the Peace courts cannot take cognizance of such annulment actions [3]. Instead, these actions fall within the general jurisdiction of the Courts of First Instance [3]. The Court further noted that the argument regarding Article 348 of the New Civil Code—that fraud is not a ground for revocation of adoption—applies only to adoptions validly decreed, not those void *ab initio* due to fraud [4].

The appealed order is reversed and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [4, 5].
