I. CAPTION
RAUL H. TANPINCO v. ANTONIO T. LOZADA and CENTURY INSURANCE CO., INC., G.R. No. L-17335, January 31, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Raul Tanpinco filed a suit against Antonio Lozada and Century Insurance Co. to recover P5,000 for Lozada's failure to clear squatters from a parcel of land within 36 months as agreed [1]. A judgment was eventually rendered against the defendants [2]. Lozada filed a "Petition for Relief Under Section 2 of Rule 38 of the Rules of Court," claiming "excusable negligence" because he personally did not receive a copy of the decision and his counsel, Atty. A.L. Balines, failed to notify him of it [3, 4]. The lower court denied the petition, noting that the records showed Atty. Balines had appeared on Lozada's behalf and had actually received a copy of the decision on March 4, 1958 [2]. Lozada appealed the denial to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Lozada is entitled to relief from judgment on the ground of excusable negligence due to his counsel's failure to notify him of the decision.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the appeal was absolutely without merit [6]. Under Section 2 of Rule 27 of the Rules of Court, when a party appears by an attorney, service upon the party shall be made upon his attorney, unless service upon the party himself is ordered by the court [6, 7]. Consequently, the failure of the party to receive a copy of the decision, or the failure of his counsel to notify him thereof, does not constitute excusable negligence that would entitle the party to a petition for relief [6, 7]. Furthermore, the Court noted that Lozada lacked a meritorious defense, as the contract explicitly stated he was aware of the risks involved in the undertaking [8, 9].

The order denying the motion for relief is **AFFIRMED** [9].
