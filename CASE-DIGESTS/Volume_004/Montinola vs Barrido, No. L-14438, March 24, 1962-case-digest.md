I. CAPTION
GREGORIO MONTINOLA, ET AL. v. MONSERRAT BARRIDO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14438, March 24, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In Cadastral Case No. 26 involving Lots 391 and 392 in Manapla, Gregorio Montinola withdrew his claim after Pablo and Luis Barrido (defendants' predecessors) sold him their rights in 1921. However, in 1941, the court adjudicated the lots to the Barridos. Montinola's heirs (plaintiffs) successfully moved for a new trial, but the proceedings were interrupted by the war [1]. In 1947, while the records were yet to be reconstituted, the Barridos obtained a decree of registration ex-parte and secured titles, which were later transferred to their heirs [2].

In 1951, plaintiffs filed Civil Case No. 721 to recover the lots. The Court of First Instance (CFI) dismissed this case in 1957, ruling it lacked jurisdiction because the issue of ownership was still pending in the unresolved Cadastral Case No. 26 [3, 4]. Subsequently, the Barrido heirs sold the lots to C.N. Hodges. Plaintiffs then filed the present action to annul the titles and recover damages. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the grounds of *res judicata* (due to the dismissal of Civil Case No. 721) and prescription [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal of the previous Civil Case No. 721 constitutes *res judicata* barring the present action.
2. W/N the proper remedy is the dismissal of the complaint.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal of Civil Case No. 721 does not constitute *res judicata*. The prior order of dismissal was predicated principally on the lower court's opinion that, in the exercise of its general jurisdiction, it lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter because the exact same matter was involved in Cadastral Case No. 26, where a new trial was pending. A dismissal on the ground of lack of jurisdiction does not constitute *res judicata* [7].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the action has not prescribed because the question of title over the lots remains unresolved in the cadastral proceedings. Instead of dismissing the present case, the lower court should have ordered its consolidation with Cadastral Case No. 26 for a joint trial and adjudication. This is especially necessary considering the lots were allegedly sold to a third party, C.N. Hodges, necessitating a unified resolution of ownership [8].

The Order of dismissal is set aside and the record is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [9].
