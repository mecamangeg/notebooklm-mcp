I. CAPTION
KER & COMPANY, LTD. v. THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS and THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-12396, January 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ker & Co. was assessed deficiency income taxes for the years 1947-1950. The Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) issued a revised assessment in a letter dated January 5, 1954 [1]. Petitioner made repeated requests for reconsideration. The CIR sent subsequent letters reiterating the demand, with the final denial dated January 23, 1956 [2, 3]. On March 1, 1956, Petitioner filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [4]. The CTA, *motu proprio*, raised the issue of jurisdiction and dismissed the petition, ruling that the appealable decision was the January 5, 1954 assessment, rendering the 1956 petition filed beyond the 30-day reglementary period [4, 5]. Petitioner appealed, arguing the period should run from the 1956 letter and questioning the CTA's authority to raise jurisdiction on its own motion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Tax Appeals can raise the question of jurisdiction *motu proprio*.
2. W/N the petition for review was filed within the prescriptive period.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of Tax Appeals is a court of special jurisdiction and can only take cognizance of matters clearly within its jurisdiction [6, 7]. To obviate the possibility of a void decision, the CTA can raise the question of jurisdiction by its own initiative, even if not raised by the parties [6, 8]. Furthermore, jurisdiction over the subject matter cannot be waived and may be raised at any stage of the proceedings, even if not pleaded in the answer [9, 10].

2. **NO.** The decision appealable to the CTA under Sections 7 and 11 of Republic Act No. 1125 was the assessment letter of January 5, 1954, as it contained the determination of tax liability and remained unaltered [5, 11]. The subsequent letter of January 23, 1956, was merely a reiteration of the previous demand [12]. While the CTA was not yet organized in January 1954, Petitioner should have filed its appeal within 30 days after the CTA's organization on July 21, 1954 [13]. Filing on March 1, 1956, was fatal, as the 30-day requirement is jurisdictional [14].

Resolution affirmed [15].
