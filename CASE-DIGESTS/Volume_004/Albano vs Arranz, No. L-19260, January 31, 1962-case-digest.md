**I. CAPTION**
DELFIN ALBANO v. HON. MANUEL ARRANZ and SAMUEL REYES, G.R. No. L-19260, January 31, 1962, J.B.L. Reyes, J.

**II. FACTS**
In the November 14, 1961 elections for Representative of Isabela, petitioner Delfin Albano (Nacionalista) ran against respondent Samuel Reyes (Liberal) [1]. During the canvass, Albano questioned the returns from several precincts in Cabagan and Reina Mercedes due to erasures and discrepancies compared to the party's carbon copies [2]. Consequently, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) ordered the suspension of the proclamation of the winning candidate pending further orders [3].

Respondent Reyes filed a petition for *mandamus* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Isabela, presided by respondent Judge Manuel Arranz, to compel the Provincial Board of Canvassers to canvass the votes and proclaim the winner, arguing the COMELEC's suspension order was void [3]. Judge Arranz took cognizance of the case and issued a preliminary injunction restraining the Board from bringing the questioned returns to Manila [3]. Albano filed a petition for prohibition with the Supreme Court to stop the CFI proceedings [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to review or override the order of the Commission on Elections suspending the proclamation of a winning candidate.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that the COMELEC's suspension of the proclamation pending an inquiry into irregularities is within its administrative jurisdiction, based on its exclusive constitutional authority to administer and enforce election laws [5].

Crucially, the correction of any error in a COMELEC order does not lie within the authority of the Court of First Instance. Under Article X, Section 2 of the Constitution, the decisions, orders, and rulings of the Commission on Elections shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court and by no other tribunal [6]. The lower court cannot arrogate unto itself the power to disregard or contradict COMELEC orders, as this would reduce the constitutional body to impotence [6].

The petition is **GRANTED**, and the respondent court is ordered to permanently refrain from proceeding with the civil case [7].
