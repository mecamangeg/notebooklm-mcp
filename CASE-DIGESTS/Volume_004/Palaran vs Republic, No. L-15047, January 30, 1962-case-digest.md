**I. CAPTION**
*In the Matter of the Petition to be Admitted a Citizen of the Philippines. Dionisio Palaran vs. Republic of the Philippines*, G.R. No. L-15047, January 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
Dionisio Palaran filed a Petition for Naturalization with an alternative prayer to be declared a Filipino citizen in the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental [1]. Evidence presented aimed to show he was the natural child of a Chinese father and a Filipino mother who could not validly marry due to the father's existing marriage in China [2]. The trial court ruled that Palaran was a Filipino citizen following the citizenship of his mother and ordered the cancellation of his alien registration, dispensing with the need to rule on the naturalization petition [3, 4]. The Republic appealed, questioning the trial court's jurisdiction to declare the petitioner a Filipino citizen [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the trial court has the jurisdiction to declare the petitioner a Filipino citizen in a naturalization proceeding.
2. W/N the petition for naturalization should be granted.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that a judicial declaration that a person is a Filipino citizen cannot be made in a petition for naturalization [6]. Under Philippine law, there is no authorized proceeding for the judicial declaration of the citizenship of an individual [6]. Citing *Tan Yu Chin v. Republic* and *Danilo Channie Tan v. Republic*, the Court held that while the law permits the acquisition of status via naturalization by judicial decree, there is no legislation authorizing the institution of a judicial proceeding to merely declare that a given person is already a citizen [6, 7].

2. **NO.** The petitioner failed to prove his qualifications for naturalization. He did not take the witness stand to demonstrate his ability to speak and write English or local dialects, or his knowledge of Filipino customs [8]. Furthermore, his alleged annual income of P2,700.00 was not proven and, even if true, was not considered lucrative considering he had a wife and nine children to support [8, 9].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** [10].
