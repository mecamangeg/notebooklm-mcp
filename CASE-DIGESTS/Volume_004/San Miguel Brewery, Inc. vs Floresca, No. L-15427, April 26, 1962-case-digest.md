I. CAPTION
SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC. v. FLORESCA, G.R. No. L-15427, April 26, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Elpidio Floresca filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against petitioner San Miguel Brewery, Inc. for reinstatement, back salaries, and separation pay [1]. Floresca alleged he was dismissed without just cause and without statutory notice [1]. San Miguel Brewery moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the claim did not fall under the CIR's jurisdiction pursuant to Republic Act No. 875 and existing jurisprudence [2]. The CIR denied the motion to dismiss and the subsequent motion for reconsideration [2]. Petitioner filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition before the Supreme Court challenging the CIR's jurisdiction [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over a claim for reinstatement, back salaries, and separation pay arising from an unjustified dismissal, absent an allegation of unfair labor practice.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the CIR's jurisdiction is limited to cases involving: (a) labor disputes certified by the President affecting national interest; (b) controversies under the Minimum Wage Law; (c) controversies under the Eight-Hour Labor Law; and (d) Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) [3].

Floresca's claim did not fall under any of these categories [4]. The Court ruled that a prayer for reinstatement, standing alone, does not confer jurisdiction upon the CIR if there is no allegation of ULP [4]. In the absence of ULP, the CIR lacks the power to grant remedies such as reinstatement or back wages under its general powers of mediation [4]. A violation of the law on separation pay (R.A. 1052) constitutes a breach of a private right cognizable by ordinary courts [5].

Petition granted. The CIR orders are set aside and declared null and void [6].
