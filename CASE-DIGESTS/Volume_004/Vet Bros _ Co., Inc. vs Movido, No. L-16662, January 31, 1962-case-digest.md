I. CAPTION
VET BROS & CO., INC. v. JOSE S. MOVIDO ET AL., G.R. No. L-16662, January 31, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Vet Bros & Co., Inc. filed a complaint against Defendant Sheriff Jose S. Movido to enjoin the sale of its properties, alleging that the judgment debt in a prior case (Civil Case No. 441) had already been satisfied. To obtain a writ of preliminary injunction, the plaintiff posted a P2,000 bond subscribed by Luzon Surety Co., Inc. The bond undertook to pay damages if the court finally decided the plaintiff was not entitled to the writ. Subsequently, the plaintiff failed to appear at the trial. The lower court dismissed the case and dissolved the injunction but made no pronouncement or award regarding damages in the order of dismissal. Later, the trial court issued an order of execution against Luzon Surety’s bond to satisfy the claim of Movido. Luzon Surety appealed this order.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a writ of execution may be issued against the surety on an injunction bond when the final judgment (order of dismissal) did not award damages.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the order of execution. Under Section 9, Rule 60 and Section 20, Rule 59 of the Rules of Court, damages against a surety on an injunction bond must be claimed, ascertained, and awarded after a proper hearing, and most importantly, must be included in the final judgment.

In this case, Movido presented no claim or evidence of damages, and the trial court's order dismissing the main case did not sentence the plaintiff or the surety to pay any damages. The Court, citing *Visayan Surety v. Aquino*, held that a judgment against a defendant cannot *per se* be enforced against the surety; a judgment against the surety must first be secured before the bond can be proceeded against. Additionally, the bond's terms only conditioned liability upon a court finding that the plaintiff was not entitled to the writ; the dismissal was merely for non-appearance and contained no such declaration.

The order appealed from is set aside.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Justices Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, and De Leon concurred; Chief Justice Bengzon took no part.)
