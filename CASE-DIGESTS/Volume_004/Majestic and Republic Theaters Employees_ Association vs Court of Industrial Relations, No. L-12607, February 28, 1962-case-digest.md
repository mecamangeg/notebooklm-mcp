I. CAPTION
MAJESTIC AND REPUBLIC THEATERS EMPLOYEES' ASSOCIATION (PAFLU) v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, L. C. EUGENIO & COMPANY, REPUBLIC THEATER ENTERPRISES, and MAJESTIC THEATER, INC., G.R. No. L-12607, February 28, 1962, 4 SCRA 457, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
L. C. Eugenio & Company owned the Republic and Majestic theaters, which were leased to and operated by Republic Theater Enterprises and Majestic Theater, Inc., respectively. Leonardo C. Eugenio was the president and general manager of all three corporations. On February 16, 1955, the operator-corporations entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with the petitioner Union effective for two years, stipulating that the lessees would not lock out employees.

Three months later, L. C. Eugenio & Company sold the theaters to Goodwill Trading Co., and the operator-corporations simultaneously agreed to terminate their leases. Goodwill then leased the theaters to a new entity, Rema, Inc. Consequently, the employees were notified of the termination of their employment and required to reapply with Rema, Inc., resulting in the loss of jobs for about 27 employees. The Union filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP). The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) dismissed the complaint, ruling that the sale and closure were legitimate exercises of ownership and management, and that there was no law requiring a new owner to retain former employees.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the sale of the theaters and the termination of the lease contracts constituted an unfair labor practice.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the transactions were suspicious and not made in good faith. The sale and lease termination occurred barely three months after the CBA was signed, were conducted in secrecy, and were hurriedly executed—evidence showed the new lessee (Rema, Inc.) was not even incorporated until four days *after* it supposedly leased the theaters. Since Leonardo C. Eugenio controlled the owner-corporation and the lessee-corporations, the Court found the transactions to be a stratagem to evade CBA commitments, specifically the "no lockout" clause.

The Court emphasized that under **Article 1700 of the New Civil Code**, labor contracts are impressed with public interest and must yield to the common good. Furthermore, the respondents violated **Section 13 of Republic Act No. 875**, which requires written notice to be served at least 30 days prior to the termination or modification of a CBA. Here, notice was given only after the sale was consummated.

The decision of the CIR is reversed. Respondents L. C. Eugenio & Company, Republic Theater Enterprises, and Majestic Theater, Inc. are guilty of unfair labor practice and are ordered to pay the locked-out employees back wages for the remaining period of the collective bargaining agreement.
