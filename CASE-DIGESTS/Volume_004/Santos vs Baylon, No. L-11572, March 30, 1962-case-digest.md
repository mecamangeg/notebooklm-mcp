I. CAPTION
ROMAN SANTOS v. FRANCISCO C. BAYLON, G.R. No. L-11572, March 30, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Roman Santos filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan against defendant Francisco Baylon, seeking to annul a deed of donation *inter vivos* and to be declared the sole heir of the deceased Rosa de los Reyes. The CFI rendered judgment declaring the donation void but dismissed the complaint, ruling that Santos was not a legitimate brother of the deceased and thus could not inherit. The court declared Baylon, the surviving husband, as the lawful owner of the properties.

Both parties appealed. Santos appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA) raising questions of fact regarding his legitimacy and relationship to the deceased. Baylon appealed directly to the Supreme Court, questioning only the legal ruling declaring the donation null and void.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court should decide an appeal involving a pure question of law when a separate appeal in the same case involving questions of fact is pending before the Court of Appeals.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Supreme Court held that although Baylon’s appeal involved a purely legal question, the case as a whole involved mixed questions of law and fact, bringing it within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals. The Court reasoned that there is no practical reason for splitting the appeal. Furthermore, the factual findings by the CA regarding Santos’ heirship could render the legal issue raised by Baylon moot or academic. To avoid possible inconsistencies between decisions, the Court ruled that the appeal must be referred to the CA [1-3].

The records of the appeal were forwarded to the Court of Appeals for proper disposition.
