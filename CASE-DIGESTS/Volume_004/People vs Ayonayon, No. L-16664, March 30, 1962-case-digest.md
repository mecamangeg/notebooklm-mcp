I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JUAN AYONAYON and GASPAR ACERADOR, G.R. No. L-16664, March 30, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On August 5, 1959, around 6:00 P.M., the Lazo family was having supper in their home in Magsingal, Ilocos Sur. Upon hearing dogs bark, Genoveva Lazo looked out the window and saw a man in green fatigue clothes pointing a gun. Gunfire erupted, killing her father Florentino and brother Jose, and wounding Genoveva. Her brother Pergentino and mother Juana Resuello hid and witnessed the accused, Juan Ayonayon and Gaspar Acerador, firing from the *batalan* (stairs). Police found .30-caliber shells at the scene and paraffin tests on both accused yielded positive traces of nitrate. The accused claimed alibis, supported by relatives stating they were at home in nearby barrios (1 km and 7 km away) at 6:00 P.M. The Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur convicted them of murder (imposing the death penalty) and frustrated murder.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the positive identification by prosecution witnesses overcomes the defense of alibi.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the defense of alibi is of very little weight when the accused are positively identified by prosecution witnesses [1]. The witnesses (Genoveva, Juana, and Pergentino) knew the accused personally and identified them immediately upon the arrival of authorities [2, 3]. The Court noted that even if the witnesses were eating with a lamp inside, it was not yet dark outside at 6:00 P.M. as sunset was at 6:38 P.M., allowing for clear visibility [4]. Furthermore, the alibis provided by relatives were based on a mere "calculation of time"; a statement that the accused were home "around 6:00 o'clock" could mean 5:30 P.M., failing to prove physical impossibility of being at the crime scene, especially given the short distances involved [1, 5, 6].

The decision of the lower court is **MODIFIED**. The penalty for the murder of Florentino and Jose Lazo is reduced to *reclusion perpetua*, while the sentence for the frustrated murder of Genoveva Lazo is **AFFIRMED**.
