I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JUANITO LLANTO, G.R. No. L-15634, April 23, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On March 6, 1958, at around 11:00 p.m. in Sto. Tomas, Batangas, Laureano de la Peña, a lineman, was shot from behind and killed after repairing a transformer [1, 2]. His companion, Hipolito Estuista, witnessed the appellant, Juanito Llanto, appear suddenly, fire at Laureano, and flee [2, 3]. Llanto was a former employee of the same electric company and held a grudge against the victim over work duties, having previously threatened Laureano’s family [3]. A paraffin test conducted the next morning revealed gunpowder residue on Llanto's hands [3].

Llanto raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was at a band concert 300 meters away [4]. To counter the paraffin test results, the defense introduced an article by alleged experts on the "Unreliability of Dermal Nitrate Test of Gunpowder" [5]. The Court of First Instance of Batangas convicted Llanto of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi prevails over the positive identification by the prosecution witness.
2. W/N a written article on the unreliability of paraffin tests is admissible evidence without proof of authenticity.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that alibi cannot prevail where it was physically possible for the accused to be at the scene. Since the concert was only 300 meters away, Llanto could have easily slipped away to commit the crime and returned [4, 6]. Furthermore, positive identification by a witness who had known the appellant for years and had no motive to lie is given greater weight, especially since the scene was illuminated by electric light and moonlight [7, 8]. Minor inconsistencies in the witness's testimony do not affect its substance or truthfulness [7, 9, 10].

2. **NO.** The Court held that for a written article to be considered adequate evidence, its authenticity and the qualifications of its alleged author must first be established [11, 12]. The defense failed to authenticate the article or the authors' qualifications, rendering it inadequate to offset the positive findings of the paraffin test [5].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [13].
