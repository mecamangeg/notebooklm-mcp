I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PAZ ARGUELLES VDA. DE LAO, CARMEN LAO, PACITA LAO, TERESA LAO and CONCEPCION LAO, G.R. No. L-16513, January 31, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On April 16, 1951, spouses Gabriel Lao (now deceased) and Paz Arguelles de Lao filed a joint income tax return for 1950 [1]. After reinvestigation requested by the spouses' lawyer, the Collector of Internal Revenue issued a revised assessment on August 3, 1954, demanding P2,198.00 as deficiency income tax, payable by September 15, 1954 [1]. The heirs failed to pay. On January 8, 1958, the Republic filed a suit for collection [1].

In their answer filed in February 1958, the defendants-heirs admitted the assessment but raised an "Alternative Cause of Action" [2]. They argued that the P2,198.00 income tax liability should be deducted from the gross estate of the deceased, which would reduce the estate tax payable. Since the estate tax had already been paid without this deduction, they claimed a right to a tax credit for the overpayment to offset the income tax deficiency [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the defendants, ordering the recomputation of the estate tax and the crediting of the overpayment against the deficiency income tax [3, 4]. The Republic appealed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendants' claim for a tax credit or refund of estate taxes is barred by the mandatory two-year prescriptive period under the Tax Code.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that while Section 309 of the National Internal Revenue Code allows the Collector to credit taxes erroneously received, this power is strictly subject to Section 306 [5, 6]. Section 306 mandates that a claim for refund or credit of any internal revenue tax must be filed with the Collector of Internal Revenue within two years from the date of payment of the tax [5, 7].

The Court emphasized that the presentation of a claim within this two-year period is a condition precedent to any right of action for a refund [5, 6]. In this case, the defendants' claim for credit was only made in their answer filed in February 1958, which was more than three years after the deficiency income tax was demanded in 1954, and presumably well beyond the payment of the estate tax [6]. Consequently, the claim for credit falls within the prohibition of Section 306 [8].

**WHEREFORE**, the judgment appealed from is reversed and the defendants are ordered to pay the amount of P2,198.00, plus surcharge, interest, and compromise penalty [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, and De Leon concurred with the ruling [8].
