I. CAPTION
ADELA SILPAO, in her behalf and in behalf of her minor son ALFONSO PAGLOMOTAN v. LOPE PAGLOMOTAN, G.R. No. L-16460, January 31, 1962, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
On June 4, 1959, Adela Silpao filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental against Lope Paglomotan for damages, acknowledgment of her son Alfonso as an adulterous child, and support [1]. She alleged that she served as the defendant's laundry woman and that he fathered her child through sexual intercourse in 1946 [1]. The defendant denied the allegations, claiming the child was fathered by another man [2].

On November 28, 1959, the trial court rendered a judgment dismissing the complaint, discrediting the plaintiff's evidence and giving credence to the defendant's version of events [3]. Dissatisfied, Silpao appealed directly to the Supreme Court [4]. Her assignments of error disputed the trial court’s findings on the credibility of witnesses, specifically arguing against the weight given to the defense's testimony and the bias of the defendant's brother [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that it lacked jurisdiction because the appeal involved largely questions of fact [6]. The Court noted that the appellants' assignments of error disputed mainly the credibility of witnesses and called for a re-evaluation of the testimonial evidence presented in the trial court [6, 7].

Under the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended by Republic Act No. 2613, appeals involving questions of fact fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, not the Supreme Court [6, 7].

Consequently, the case was ordered certified to the Court of Appeals for determination in accordance with law [6].
