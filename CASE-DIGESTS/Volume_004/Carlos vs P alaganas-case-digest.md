I. CAPTION
DOMINADOR CARLOS v. BENIGNO PALAGANAS, Adm. Case No. 518, April 23, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Dominador Carlos filed an administrative complaint against Respondent Benigno Palaganas [1, 2]. In his verified answer, Palaganas raised a defense and accused Carlos of contempt for making the proceedings public before a final decision was rendered. Palaganas alleged that Carlos furnished the Boy Scouts of the Philippines (Palaganas' employer) with a photostat copy of a Supreme Court Order dated February 20, 1962, which requested Palaganas to submit evidence [2]. Palaganas argued that this act was intended to damage his standing with his employer and constituted a violation of the confidentiality of the proceedings under Section 10 of Rule 128 of the Rules of Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N proceedings for contempt should be initiated against the complainant for the alleged violation of the confidentiality of the administrative proceedings.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court found that the respondent's allegations constituted a charge that warranted an explanation from the complainant. Palaganas alleged that the disclosure of the Court's Order to his employer violated Section 10 of Rule 128 of the Rules of Court regarding the confidentiality of bar proceedings [2]. Consequently, the Supreme Court resolved to require the complainant to answer the charge within five days from notice to explain why proceedings for contempt should not be had against him [3].
