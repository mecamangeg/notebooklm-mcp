I. CAPTION
BENJAMIN T. ASUNCION v. LUZ DE ASIS DE AQUINO, G.R. No. L-13704, April 18, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On June 20, 1950, respondent Luz de Asis de Aquino filed a claim for compensation for her husband's death against petitioner Benjamin Asuncion with the Workmen's Compensation Division of the Department of Labor [1]. She also filed a similar action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan pursuant to Act No. 3428, which governed such claims at the time [2]. While these were pending, Republic Act No. 772 was enacted on June 20, 1952, conferring exclusive jurisdiction over compensation claims to the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) [2].

Petitioner failed to appear during the WCC investigation [1]. Records showed he received notice of the hearing on March 17, 1954, but failed to appeal or act until receiving the order of award [3, 4]. On April 5, 1955, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the WCC lacked jurisdiction because the CFI had already acquired jurisdiction over the claim prior to the new law, and that he was denied due process [5]. The WCC denied the motion, prompting this petition for certiorari [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Workmen's Compensation Commission validly acquired jurisdiction over the claim despite the prior filing of the case in the Court of First Instance.
2. W/N the petitioner was denied his day in court.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Upon the enactment of Republic Act No. 772, regular courts were divested of jurisdiction over compensation cases because such jurisdiction was transferred to the Workmen's Compensation Commission [6]. Although the CFI had already acquired jurisdiction when the claim was filed, jurisdiction over a pending case may be ousted by the valid repeal of the statute on which it wholly depends, unless the repealing Act contains a clause saving pending actions from the operation of the repeal [6, 7]. Since R.A. 772 contains no such saving clause, the CFI was divested of authority, and the WCC properly took cognizance of the claim [6].

2. **NO.** The petitioner was duly notified of the hearings. Records confirm he received the notice on March 17, 1954, yet he took no steps to request a new hearing until he filed a motion for reconsideration on April 5, 1955—nearly a year later [3, 4]. Having kept silent for that duration, he cannot complain that adverse action was taken without his day in court [4].

Petition denied; order affirmed [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
A dissenting opinion (Justice unnamed in source) argued that once a court acquires jurisdiction, it retains it unless a subsequent law explicitly transfers pending cases to another body. The dissent noted that R.A. 772 lacked a provision transferring actions already pending before the CFI to the WCC, and thus the CFI should have retained jurisdiction [9].
