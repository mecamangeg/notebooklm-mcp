I. CAPTION
TALISAY-SILAY MILLING CO., INC. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and TALISAY-SILAY EMPLOYEES and LABORERS ASSOCIATION (TELA), G.R. No. L-17344, April 23, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Following a strike on December 17, 1952, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) declared the strike illegal but ordered the reinstatement of workers pursuant to a prior stipulation. This order was affirmed by the Supreme Court, and the workers were reinstated in January 1956. The Union moved for the payment of backwages covering the period from November 10, 1953 (when the reinstatement order became executory) to January 1956 (actual reinstatement).

The CIR Chief Examiner computed the backwages at P238,430.81. The method used was: (Average daily wage of each laborer in 1951-1952) x (Actual number of working days of the Company during the backwage period). Talisay-Silay Milling Co. (Company) objected, arguing that based on American jurisprudence (Rothenberg), the computation should be based on the "average pay in a given period." The Company proposed averaging the total compensation over 24 months, which resulted in a lower amount. The CIR approved the Examiner's report. The Company appealed via certiorari, and the Supreme Court issued a preliminary injunction upon the filing of a surety bond by Capital Insurance & Surety Co. [1-6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR's method of computing backwages (Average Daily Wage x Actual Working Days) is correct.
2. W/N the Company and its surety are liable for legal interest as damages for the delay caused by the injunction.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the Examiner's computation was proper. The "average pay" method cited by the Company from American jurisprudence is applicable only where work is seasonal, there is no fixed wage, or the number of actual working days is unknown. In this case, the Company's records clearly showed the actual working days from November 1953 to January 1956. Had the laborers been reinstated on time, they would have worked those specific days. It is fair and just that they be paid their average daily wage for the actual working days they missed due to the Company's failure to reinstate them immediately [7, 8]. Furthermore, the Court had already affirmed this specific method in a previous related decision (G.R. Nos. L-14023 and L-14135) [9, 10].

2. **YES.** Under Section 14 of Commonwealth Act No. 113, the institution of an appeal does not stay the execution of a CIR decision or award. The preliminary injunction deprived the workers of wages they were entitled to receive. Under Article 2209 of the Civil Code, damages for delay in the performance of an obligation to pay money consist of the payment of interest at the legal rate. Consequently, the surety bond is liable for the interest on the backwages from the date the writ was granted until full payment [11, 12].

Orders affirmed. Writ of preliminary injunction dissolved. Capital Insurance & Surety Co. sentenced to pay interest on the backwages.
