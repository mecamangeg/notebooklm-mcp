**I. CAPTION**
**BASILISA TAN DELGADO, assisted by her husband MIGUEL DELGADO v. ESTEBAN GAMBOA and ANGEL JOSON**, G.R. No. L-14326, February 28, 1962, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
The case involves a parcel of agricultural land in Isabela originally registered to Dionisio Rañesis [1, 2]. After Dionisio and his wife Maria Castañeda died, Maria's brother, Agapito Castañeda, instituted guardianship proceedings for their minor children in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Tuguegarao [2]. Agapito was appointed guardian and, on September 27, 1952, the JP Court authorized him to sell the land [2]. He sold the property to petitioner Basilisa Tan Delgado for P7,000 on October 23, 1952, resulting in the issuance of a new title in her name [2].

However, prior to the JP Court's order to sell, respondent Angel Joson had already filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Isabela on September 6, 1952, for the administration of the Rañesis intestate estate [3]. Respondent Esteban Gamboa was appointed administrator [3]. The CFI ordered Agapito to surrender the title, but he failed to do so [3]. Delgado filed an action for recovery of ownership and possession against Gamboa and Joson [1, 4]. The CFI dismissed the complaint and declared the sale to Delgado void, ruling that the JP Court lacked jurisdiction and the property was in *custodia legis* [5, 6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Justice of the Peace Court had jurisdiction to authorize the sale of the minors' property valued at P7,000.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the nullity of the sale. The Court ruled that under Republic Act No. 643, the jurisdiction granted to Justice of the Peace courts is limited to the appointment of guardians for **persons only**, not for the properties of wards [7]. The phrase "in matters within their respective jurisdiction" in the law refers to the appointment of guardians for persons within their territorial limits [7].

Even assuming *arguendo* that JP courts have concurrent jurisdiction over the properties of minors, such jurisdiction is limited to cases where the value of the estate falls within the court's jurisdictional amount [8]. In this case, the property was sold for P7,000, which is in excess of the jurisdictional amount for Justice of the Peace courts (P2,000) [8]. Furthermore, at the time the JP Court authorized the sale, the property was already in *custodia legis* due to the pending settlement proceedings in the CFI [6].

**Judgment affirmed.**
