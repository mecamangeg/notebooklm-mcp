I. CAPTION
LORENZA FABIAN, ET AL. v. HON. EULOGIO MENCIAS, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-15714, April 23, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Pedro Interior filed a collection suit against petitioners Lorenza and Albano Fabian. The Court of First Instance of Rizal rendered a judgment dismissing the case, notice of which Interior received on October 7, 1958. Eleven days later, on October 18, Interior filed a "Petition for Relief from Judgment," which was treated as a motion for new trial based on the decision being contrary to evidence and excusable negligence. The court denied this on December 8, and Interior received notice on December 15, 1958.

On December 27, 1958, Interior filed a second pleading titled "Urgent Motion for New Trial" based on exactly the same grounds as his previous petition. The court denied this on January 6, 1959. Interior then filed a Motion for Reconsideration on January 26, 1959. The respondent Judge Mencias granted this motion on May 4, 1959, setting aside the decision and ordering a new trial. Petitioners filed for certiorari, arguing the court had no jurisdiction to issue the order because the judgment had already become final.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a second motion for new trial based on the same grounds as the first motion suspends the running of the period to appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** A second motion for new trial may be allowed only if based on a ground not existing when the first motion was made. Under Section 4, Rule 37 of the Rules of Court (implementing the omnibus motion rule in Rule 26, Section 8), a second motion for new trial filed on grounds already existing and available at the time of the first motion is out of order.

Since Interior’s second motion was a mere reiteration of the grounds in his first motion, it was *pro forma* and did not suspend the running of the appeal period (*Rili v. Chunaco*; *Sawit v. Rodas*). Calculating the time: Interior used 11 days before filing his first motion (Oct 7 to Oct 18). The period resumed on December 16 (the day after he received notice of denial). The remaining 19 days expired on January 3, 1959. Consequently, the judgment was already final when he filed the Motion for Reconsideration on January 26, 1959.

The petition is granted and the order of May 4, 1959 is annulled.
