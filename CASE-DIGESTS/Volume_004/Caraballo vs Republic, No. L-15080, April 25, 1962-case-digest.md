**I. CAPTION**
**IN THE MATTER OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MINOR NORMA LEE CABER. RICARDO R. CARABALLO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-15080, April 25, 1962, Padilla, J.

**II. FACTS**
Ricardo R. Caraballo, an American citizen and Staff Sergeant in the United States Air Force, was detailed at Clark Field, Angeles, Pampanga, where he lived with his wife [1]. On September 26, 1958, he filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pampanga to adopt Norma Lee Caber, a five-day-old natural child [1]. Caraballo alleged that he had resided in Clark Air Base for 25 months, intended to retire in the Philippines, and wished to raise the child as his own [2, 3]. The Provincial Fiscal moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that Caraballo was a non-resident alien and thus disqualified to adopt [4]. The CFI denied the motion and subsequently granted the adoption [2, 5]. The Republic appealed the decision to the Supreme Court [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner, an American citizen stationed in the Philippines for military assignment, is disqualified from adopting as a non-resident alien.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner is a non-resident alien and is therefore disqualified to adopt under Article 335(4) of the Civil Code [6, 7].

The Court explained that a person is deemed a resident of a place only if they have their abode and live there permanently, chosen freely and voluntarily [8]. Domicile requires physical presence and the intent to remain permanently [8]. In this case, Caraballo's stay in the Philippines was due to his assignment as a staff sergeant in the U.S. Air Force; thus, his physical presence was temporary and not a result of his free and voluntary choice to remain indefinitely [7]. The law disqualifies non-resident aliens to prevent adopted minors from being removed from the country and placed beyond the reach and protection of Philippine laws [8].

The decree appealed from was set aside and the petition for adoption was dismissed [7].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justice Concepcion concurred in the result [9].
