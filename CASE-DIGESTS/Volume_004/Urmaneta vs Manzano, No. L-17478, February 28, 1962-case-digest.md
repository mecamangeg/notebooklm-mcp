I. CAPTION
WENCESLAO URMANETA v. MARTIN MANZANO, G.R. No. L-17478, February 28, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Wenceslao Urmaneta filed a complaint against Martin Manzano and others to recover possession of a parcel of land (Lot 6654-B) covered by a Homestead Application. Urmaneta alleged ownership based on a transfer of homestead rights from the Heirs of Pio Novesteros, which was approved by the Director of Lands on January 18, 1956, and a subsequent order for the issuance of a patent in his favor dated June 1, 1956 [1, 2].

Defendant Manzano claimed possession as a tenant of Teodora Manzano, whom he alleged was the true owner [3]. Urmaneta filed a motion for summary judgment, attaching documents showing that Teodora Manzano had transferred her rights to him in 1950 and that the Director of Lands had approved the transfer of rights to Urmaneta [4]. Manzano opposed, arguing Teodora was an indispensable party and had filed a protest against Urmaneta [5].

The Court of First Instance of Isabela granted the summary judgment, declaring Urmaneta the equitable owner and ordering Manzano to vacate, finding no genuine issue as to any material fact [6, 7]. Manzano appealed to the Court of Appeals, which elevated the case to the Supreme Court as the issue involved the correctness of the summary judgment based on the pleadings and documents [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court correctly rendered a summary judgment on the ground that there was no genuine issue of material fact.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision, holding that there was really no genuine issue of fact, or if there was, it was easily determinable from the pleadings and attached documents [9].

The Court found that the documentary evidence conclusively established Urmaneta's ownership. The documents showed that the Heirs of the original applicant, Pio Novesteros, transferred their rights to Urmaneta, which the Director of Lands approved [3]. Furthermore, while Teodora Manzano had previously asserted rights, she had sold her rights to Urmaneta in 1950 and confirmed this transfer in a later affidavit [3, 10]. The defendant, who only claimed to be a tenant and did not claim ownership for himself, could not shield himself behind a protest by Teodora that had effectively been overcome by the Bureau of Lands' approval of the transfer and order for issuance of patent to Urmaneta [9, 11].

Consequently, the trial court properly rendered summary judgment because the material facts regarding ownership and the validity of the transfer were not genuinely controverted by the defendant's evidence [9, 12].

Decision affirmed [13].
