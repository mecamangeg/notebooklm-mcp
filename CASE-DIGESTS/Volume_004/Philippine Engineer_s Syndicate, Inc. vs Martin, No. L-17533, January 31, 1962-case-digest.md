**I. CAPTION**
PHILIPPINE ENGINEER'S SYNDICATE, INC. v. FLORA S. MARTIN and WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-17533, January 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
Aurelio Martin was employed by petitioner as a hatching plant operator at the Biñga-Hydro Electric Project. On December 2, 1957, at around 6:10 P.M. after work, Aurelio and other workers waited by the roadside for the company service truck to bring them home. When the truck passed without stopping, the group ran after it. Aurelio attempted to ride the platform of the moving truck but slipped, fell, and was run over by the rear wheel, causing his death. Respondent Flora S. Martin, his widow, filed a claim for compensation. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded death benefits. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the accident did not arise out of employment and was caused by the decedent's notorious negligence.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the accident arose out of or in the course of employment.
2. W/N the death was caused by the employee's notorious negligence.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The accident arose out of or in the course of employment. The truck involved was a service truck furnished by the petitioner specifically to convey its employees home from work. The Court cited the rule that off-premise injuries incurred while an employee is on the way to or from work in a vehicle owned or supplied by the employer are compensable.

2. **NO.** The deceased was not guilty of notorious negligence. Notorious negligence is more than simple or contributory negligence; it implies a deliberate courting of death that no man in his senses would do. The fact that the truck was in motion when Aurelio boarded it does not constitute notorious negligence alone, particularly because the truck was going upgrade and running slowly, and other men successfully boarded it.

The decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission is **AFFIRMED**.
