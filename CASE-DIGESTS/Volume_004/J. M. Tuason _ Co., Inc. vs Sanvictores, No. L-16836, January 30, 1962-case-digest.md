I. CAPTION
**J. M. TUASON & CO., INC. v. BIENVENIDO SANVICTORES, G.R. No. L-16836, January 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.**

II. FACTS
Petitioner J. M. Tuason & Co., Inc. is the registered owner of the Tatalon Estate. Respondent Bienvenido Sanvictores occupied a portion (Lot 49) which he bought in 1949 from Pedro Deudor, who claimed title against Tuason [1]. In 1953, Tuason and Deudor entered into a compromise agreement where Deudor recognized Tuason’s ownership, subject to certain rights of Deudor’s vendees [2].

In 1958, Tuason filed an action for ejectment (*accion publiciana*) against Sanvictores (Civil Case No. Q-3519). The Court of First Instance (CFI) rendered judgment declaring Sanvictores without right to possession and ordering him to vacate [3]. Sanvictores did not appeal, and the judgment became final and executory [3].

Subsequently, Sanvictores filed a separate suit for specific performance (Civil Case No. Q-4809) to compel Tuason to sell him the lot based on the 1953 compromise [4]. He then moved to suspend the execution of the ejectment judgment. The CFI denied the motion [4]. Sanvictores filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA), which granted the writ and ordered the suspension of execution pending the specific performance case [4, 5]. Tuason appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to issue the writ of certiorari regarding the execution of the final judgment.
2. W/N the execution of the final ejectment judgment should be suspended due to the pending specific performance case.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court of Appeals can only issue writs of certiorari in aid of its appellate jurisdiction [6, 7]. In this case, no questions of fact were raised regarding the execution of the judgment; the only issue was a question of law (whether execution should be suspended) [6]. Since the judgment in the ejectment case was already final and the issue was purely legal, no appeal could be taken to the CA [7]. Therefore, the CA lacked jurisdiction to entertain the petition [7, 8].

2. **NO.** Sanvictores' claim for specific performance (preferential right to buy) was in the nature of a compulsory counterclaim under Section 6, Rule 10 (now Rule 6) of the Rules of Court [9, 10]. It was necessarily connected with the right of possession asserted by Tuason and did not require the presence of third parties [10]. Under Section 10, Rule 9, the failure to set up such rights in the ejectment suit resulted in a waiver thereof [9, 10]. Consequently, the claim became barred after the judgment in the possessory action became final [10]. It was error for the CA to consider the pending specific performance suit as a prejudicial question [10]. Furthermore, the Supreme Court noted that the Deudor-Tuason compromise had already been validly rescinded in a prior case (*Deudor v. Tuason*) [11].

**Petition GRANTED. The decision of the Court of Appeals is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.**
