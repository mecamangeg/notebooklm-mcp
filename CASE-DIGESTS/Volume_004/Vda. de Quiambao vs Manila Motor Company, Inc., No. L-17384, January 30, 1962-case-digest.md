I. CAPTION
NESTORA RIGOR VDA. DE QUIAMBAO, ET AL. v. MANILA MOTOR COMPANY, INC. and THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-17384, January 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Manila Motor Company, Inc. sought to enforce a pre-war judgment (Civil Case No. 58043) against the deceased Gaudencio Quiambao for an unpaid balance of P1,542.72. Before the war, Quiambao had surrendered the car to the company. Petitioners (Quiambao's heirs) argued this surrender amounted to a foreclosure or rescission. They also contended that the action was barred by prescription because the company only sued after the Moratorium Law was declared void. In a Motion for Reconsideration of the Supreme Court's decision affirming the lower courts, petitioners further argued that enforcing the accumulated compound interest (ballooning the debt to P30,000–P40,000) was inequitable.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Moratorium Law suspended the running of the statute of limitations.
2. W/N the surrender of the car operated as a foreclosure or rescission of the contract.
3. W/N the accumulated interest should be reduced on grounds of equity.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Citing *Rutter v. Esteban*, the Court held that the Moratorium Law was not declared void *ab initio* but was merely declared inoperative once its continued enforcement became unreasonable. Therefore, the law effectively suspended the statute of limitations for monetary obligations within its purview while it was in effect [1, 2]. Consequently, the period for enforcing the credit was tolled, regardless of whether the creditor filed suit before or after the law was voided [3, 4].

2. **NO.** The Court maintained its previous finding that the deceased surrendered the car only for "storage" or deposit pending the settlement of the civil case. This act did not constitute a foreclosure of the chattel mortgage or a rescission of the sale [4].

3. **YES.** Applying the doctrine in *Warner, Barnes & Co. v. Yasay*, the Court ruled it equitable to eliminate interest that accrued during the war years, considering the lack of bad faith and the objective impossibility of paying "enemy" creditors during the occupation [5]. Furthermore, the Court clarified that the respondent could not enforce the compound interest provision of the original chattel mortgage because the final pre-war judgment (which superseded the contract) provided only for simple interest of 12% per annum [6].

Accordingly, the judgment was reaffirmed, subject to the clarification that the liability is limited to the principal of P1,542.72 plus simple interest of 12% per annum, excluding interest during the war years [6, 7].
