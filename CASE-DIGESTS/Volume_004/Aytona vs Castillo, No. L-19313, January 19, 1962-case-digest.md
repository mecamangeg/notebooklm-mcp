I. CAPTION
DOMINADOR R. AYTONA v. ANDRES V. CASTILLO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19313, January 19, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On December 29, 1961, the outgoing President Carlos P. Garcia issued approximately 350 "midnight" or "last-minute" *ad interim* appointments, including that of petitioner Dominador R. Aytona as Governor of the Central Bank. Aytona took his oath of office on the same day. On December 30, 1961, President-elect Diosdado Macapagal assumed office. On December 31, 1961, President Macapagal issued Administrative Order No. 2, recalling and cancelling all *ad interim* appointments made by his predecessor after December 13, 1961. On January 1, 1962, President Macapagal appointed respondent Andres V. Castillo as *ad interim* Central Bank Governor, who qualified immediately. Aytona instituted a proceeding for prohibition and mandamus, challenging Castillo's title to the office, arguing that his prior appointment and qualification made his tenure irrevocable.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the incoming President could validly revoke the mass *ad interim* "midnight appointments" made by the outgoing President, even after the appointees had already qualified.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court dismissed the action, effectively sustaining the revocation.

While the general rule is that an appointment becomes irrevocable once the appointee has qualified, the Court held that this rule does not apply to mass *ad interim* appointments issued in the last hours of an outgoing administration. The Court ruled that an outgoing Chief Executive acts merely as a "care-taker" duty-bound to ensure an orderly transfer of power and should not obstruct the policies of the successor. The issuance of 350 appointments in one night ("midnight appointments") constitutes an abuse of presidential prerogatives and lacks the "double care" required when *ad interim* appointments are to be considered by a different Commission on Appointments and submitted by a new President.

The Court held that the "rush conditional appointments, hurried maneuvers and other happenings" detracted from the good faith, morality, and propriety necessary to claim equitable relief against the revocation. Under the principle of separation of powers, the Court declined to disregard Administrative Order No. 2.

**Disposition:** Action dismissed, without costs.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
*   **Padilla, J. (Concurring):** The appointments ceased to be valid upon the expiration of the term of the Congress existing at the time they were made (Dec. 30, 1961), as they are effective only until "the next adjournment of the Congress."
*   **Bautista Angelo, J. (Concurring):** The interval between the adjournment *sine die* of one Congress and the session of another is not a "recess"; thus, the President had no power to make *ad interim* appointments during this period.
*   **Concepcion, J. (Concurring in part and dissenting in part):** Concurs in the denial of writs based on equitable discretion but maintains that the appointments were legally complete and irrevocable upon qualification.
*   **Barrera, J. (Dissenting):** The appointments were validly made during a recess, were complete upon qualification, and could not be revoked without cause. The Court should not judge the "wisdom" or "propriety" of the Executive's acts.
