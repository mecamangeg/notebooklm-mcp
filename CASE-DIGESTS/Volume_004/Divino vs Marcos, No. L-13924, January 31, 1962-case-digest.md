I. CAPTION
JACOBO DIVINO v. RAMONA FABIE DE MARCOS and VENTURA MARCOS, G.R. No. L-13924, January 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Jacobo Divino purchased a house on a lot owned by defendant Ramona Fabie de Marcos (Hacienda Fabie) on May 7, 1936. Before the purchase, Divino was assured by the owner and the rental collector that he could remain on the lot as long as he paid the rentals. There was no written agreement on the duration of the lease, and rentals were paid monthly. In 1947, Divino constructed additions to the house costing P20,000 with defendants' consent.

In 1955, defendants filed an ejectment case against Divino, which was dismissed. Subsequently, defendants notified Divino that the lease would be terminated on April 30, 1956. The trial court, applying Article 1687 of the Civil Code, ordered the defendants to execute a contract of lease in favor of Divino for a period of two years. Defendants appealed, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction to order the execution of a lease contract when the lease had already terminated.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the court may fix a longer term for the lease given the circumstances of the case.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The power of the courts to "fix a longer term for lease" is discretionary or potestative, to be exercised in accordance with the particular circumstances of the case. Citing *Acasio v. Corp. de los PP. Dominicos*, the Court held that a longer term may be granted where equities come into play demanding extension.

In this case, the lot had been rented by Divino and his predecessor for over 20 years. Although rentals were paid monthly, no period was set, and the lease had been tacitly renewed prior to the ejectment case. Considering Divino made substantial improvements under the impression he could stay as long as he paid rentals, and the difficulty of finding a new place to transfer these improvements, it is fair and equitable to grant an extension of two years.

The Court modified the trial court's decision: (1) the two-year period shall commence from February 19, 1957 (the date the motion for reconsideration was denied); (2) the monthly rental is fixed at P30.00; and (3) the execution of a new contract is unnecessary as the final decision serves that purpose.

Judgment MODIFIED as to the start date and rental rate, and AFFIRMED in all other respects.
