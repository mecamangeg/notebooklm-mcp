I. CAPTION
MANUEL YAP *alias* YAP SUAT POO v. THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-13944, March 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On March 8, 1955, Manuel Yap filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu. He claimed to be born in the Philippines, educated in government-recognized schools, and employed with a sufficient salary. To support his petition, he presented character witnesses Gilbert V. Emata and Rafael Yap, along with various clearances (tax, police, court, health). The CFI granted the petition.

The Solicitor General appealed, primarily arguing that witness Emata had not known the petitioner for the required five-year period. While the Supreme Court found this specific objection without merit—noting the witness had known Yap since pre-war times—the Court proceeded to review whether Yap had sufficiently proven his qualifications and the absence of disqualifications under the law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner sufficiently discharged the burden of proving the absence of disqualifications for naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that the absence of disqualifications provided by Section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 is "part and parcel of the case for naturalization," and the petitioner has the burden of proving such absence affirmatively. This must be established not only by the petitioner's own testimony but also by that of the subscribing witnesses.

While the witnesses testified to Yap's good moral character and lack of criminal record, the Court found their testimonies "deficient and unsatisfactory" regarding specific negative qualifications. Specifically, the witnesses failed to provide sufficient facts to infer that the petitioner was not opposed to organized government, did not teach the necessity of violence for his ideas, and did not believe in the practice of polygamy. Citing *Ng v. Republic*, the Court ruled that the sworn assertion of the applicant alone is insufficient. Consequently, the decision appealed from was reversed and the petition for naturalization was denied.
