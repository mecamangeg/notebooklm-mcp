I. CAPTION
ELIZALDE ROPE FACTORY, INC. v. SOCIAL SECURITY COMMISSION, No. L-15163, February 28, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On September 17, 1957, laborers of petitioner Elizalde Rope Factory, Inc. went on strike, which lasted until mid-February 1958 [1]. Edilberto Tupas, a laborer and striker, died on May 6, 1958, shortly after work resumed [1]. The petitioner did not pay Social Security Commission (SSC) premiums for Tupas during the strike period [1]. On July 16, 1958, the SSC billed the petitioner for the unpaid premiums [2]. The petitioner refused to pay the employer's 3.5% contribution for the strike duration, arguing that Tupas was not an "employee" during that time as he rendered no service and received no wages [2-4]. The SSC denied the petitioner's request for reconsideration via Resolution No. 41, declaring that the obligation to remit contributions exists as long as the employer-employee relationship is not terminated [5-7]. The petitioner appealed the resolution to the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the employer is required to pay Social Security premiums for an employee during the period the employee is on strike.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the SSC resolution. The Court held that although a worker renders no service and receives no compensation during a strike, the employer-employee relationship is not severed or dissolved [8, 9]. A strike is merely a means for workers to express grievances and enforce demands, not an intent to terminate their relationship with the employer [9].

Sections 18 and 19 of the Social Security Act (Republic Act No. 1161) require contributions to be made "during his employment" [10, 11]. These provisions do not require that contributions be based on monthly compensation actually earned or received, but rather on the existence of the employment coverage [11, 12]. Since Tupas's employment did not cease during the strike, the monthly premium accrued, and the petitioner was obligated to pay its contribution in accordance with SSC Circular No. 21 [12].

Resolution affirmed, with costs against the petitioner [13].
