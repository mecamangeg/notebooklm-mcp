I. CAPTION
ALLEN McCONN v. ASSOCIATED INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-16550, January 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Allen McConn filed Civil Case No. 24790 against Paul Haragan in the Court of First Instance of Manila. During the pendency of the case, Haragan sought to travel to Hong Kong and Japan for business [1, 2]. The trial court granted permission on the condition that Haragan post a P4,000 bond to guarantee his return to the Philippines by September 16, 1955 [1]. The bond, posted by Haragan as principal and Associated Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. as surety, stipulated that if Haragan failed to return, the bond would answer *pro tanto* for any judgment rendered against him [3].

Haragan left but failed to return on the scheduled date because the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs banned his re-entry, a fact communicated to him by the Philippine Consulate in Hong Kong [4]. Consequently, he missed the scheduled hearings. The trial court eventually rendered judgment ordering Haragan to pay McConn P5,500 plus interest and fees [4]. When McConn moved to execute the bond to satisfy the judgment, the Surety opposed it, arguing that Haragan's return was rendered impossible by the government [4]. The lower court released the Surety from liability, prompting McConn to appeal [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the surety is liable under the bond given that the principal's failure to return was caused by the government's refusal to allow his re-entry.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order releasing the surety. The Court held that the surety's principal commitment was to guarantee Haragan's return; the liability to pay the judgment was conditioned upon his failure to do so [5]. However, because the Philippine Government (the obligee) itself rendered Haragan's return legally and physically impossible by banning his re-entry, the obligation was extinguished [5].

The Court applied **Article 1266 of the Civil Code**, which provides that "[t]he debtor in obligation to do shall also be released when the prestation becomes legally or physically impossible without the fault of the obligor" [6]. Citing *Tabora v. Lazatin*, the Court ruled that where the fulfillment of the principal obligation is prevented by the act of the government/obligee, the accessory obligation of the surety is likewise extinguished and the bond is released from liability [5, 6].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [7].
