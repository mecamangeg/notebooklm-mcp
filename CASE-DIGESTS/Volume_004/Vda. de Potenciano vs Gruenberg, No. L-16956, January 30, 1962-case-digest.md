I. CAPTION
SALVACION FERIA VDA. DE POTENCIANO v. WILLIAM GRUENBERG, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16956, January 30, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On September 21, 1959, plaintiff Vda. de Potenciano filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to enforce a judgment rendered on August 12, 1949, in a previous case (Civil Case No. 3996) [1]. The 1949 judgment ordered defendant Gruenberg to pay P7,000.00 in unpaid rentals and P500.00 in damages [1].

Gruenberg argued that the 1949 judgment was void for lack of valid notice of the hearing, claiming his counsel had withdrawn. He further alleged that the action to enforce the judgment had already prescribed, as more than ten years had elapsed since the decision was dated August 12, 1949 [2].

The lower court found that Gruenberg's counsel's motion to withdraw in the original case had been denied, and that counsel had actually appeared during the trial [3, 4]. It also found that Gruenberg was served a copy of the 1949 decision on August 21, 1949 [5, 6]. The CFI ruled in favor of the plaintiff. Gruenberg appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 1949 judgment is void for lack of valid notice to the defendant.
2. W/N the action to enforce the judgment has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The claim that the judgment is null and void for lack of notice is without factual basis. The records showed that the defendant's counsel was notified and appeared at the hearing (as his motion to withdraw was denied), and the defendant himself received a copy of the decision [4, 7].

2. **NO.** The action has not prescribed. The Court held that the date of the decision (August 12, 1949) is not the effective date from which the ten-year period for enforcement is counted. A decision is not binding on the parties until they have been furnished copies thereof [8, 9]. Since the defendant received a copy of the decision on August 21, 1949, the period for enforcement began from that date. The Court calculated that from August 21, 1949, to the filing of the complaint on September 21, 1959, only "nine years and eleven months had passed" [6].

ACCORDINGLY, the decision appealed from is affirmed [9].
