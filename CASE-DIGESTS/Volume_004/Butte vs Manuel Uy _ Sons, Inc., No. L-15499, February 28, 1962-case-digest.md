I. CAPTION
ANGELA M. BUTTE v. MANUEL UY & SONS, INC., G.R. No. L-15499, February 28, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Jose V. Ramirez was a co-owner of a house and lot in Sta. Cruz, Manila, holding a one-sixth (1/6) undivided share [1]. He died on October 20, 1951, and his estate, which included said share, was placed under judicial administration with the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) as administrator [2]. Petitioner Angela M. Butte was a testamentary heir bequeathed one-third (1/3) of the free portion of Ramirez's estate [2].

On December 9, 1958, while estate proceedings were pending, Marie Garnier Vda. de Ramirez (another co-owner) sold her undivided 1/6 share to Respondent Manuel Uy & Sons, Inc. for P500,000.00 [3]. On the same day, the Respondent (buyer) notified BPI of the sale [4]. On December 11, 1958, the vendor (Marie) also sent written notice of the sale to BPI, which BPI received on December 15 and forwarded to Butte's counsel, who received it on December 16, 1958 [4].

On January 15, 1959, Butte tendered the redemption price to the Respondent, who refused it. She immediately consigned the amount in court and filed an action for legal redemption [5]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that Butte had no right to redeem as the property was under administration, and that her offer was made beyond the 30-day statutory period [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N an heir can exercise the right of legal redemption over a share sold by a co-owner while the decedent's estate is still under judicial administration.
2. W/N the petitioner exercised the right of legal redemption within the 30-day period prescribed by law.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the petitioner, as a testamentary heir, acquired her interest in the property from the moment of the decedent's death pursuant to Article 777 of the Civil Code, which states that rights to succession are transmitted from the moment of death [7][8]. Consequently, the heirs became co-owners of the property immediately upon Jose V. Ramirez's death [9]. While the judicial administrator has the right to possession of the estate for payment of debts (Rule 85, Sec. 3), this does not include the right of legal redemption, which is a personal right derived from co-ownership and does not form part of the estate administration [10]. Therefore, Butte, as a co-owner, had the standing to exercise the right of redemption under Article 1620 [11][9].

2. **YES.** The Court held that the redemption was timely. Under Article 1623 of the Civil Code, the 30-day period for legal redemption is counted from "notice in writing by the respective vendor" [7][12]. The Court emphasized that this method of notice is exclusive; thus, the notice given by the buyer (Respondent) was ineffective and should be disregarded [12]. The valid notice from the vendor was received by Butte's counsel on December 16, 1958 [13]. Counting 30 days from December 16 (excluding the first day and including the last), the deadline was January 15, 1959 [13]. Since Butte consigned the price on that exact date, the redemption was valid [13].

The judgment of the lower court was reversed and set aside, and the Respondent was ordered to accept the consigned price and convey the undivided portion to the Petitioner [14].
