I. CAPTION
SOUTHERN LINES, INC. v. COURT OF APPEALS and CITY OF ILOILO, G.R. No. L-16629, January 31, 1962, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
The City of Iloilo purchased rice from the National Rice and Corn Corporation (NARIC), which was shipped on board the SS "General Wright" owned by Southern Lines, Inc. On September 3, 1948, the City received the shipment but noted a shortage of 13,319 kilos (equivalent to 41 sacks) on the bill of lading [1]. Despite the shortage, the City paid the full value of the shipment but subsequently filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo to recover the excess payment of P6,486.35 [1, 2]. The CFI absolved NARIC but held Southern Lines liable for the shortage [2]. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the decision [3]. Southern Lines petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing it was exempt from liability because the shortage was due to the "bad condition of the sacks" (shrinkage/leakage) and that the City failed to file a claim within 24 hours as required by Article 366 of the Code of Commerce [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Southern Lines is liable for the shortage despite the alleged improper packing of the goods.
2. W/N the action is barred by the City's failure to file a claim within 24 hours under Article 366 of the Code of Commerce.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Articles 361 and 362 of the Code of Commerce, a carrier is not relieved of liability for damages caused by the nature or defect of the goods (such as improper packing) if the damage occurred due to its negligence or failure to take proper precautions [6, 7]. If the fact of improper packing is known to the carrier or apparent upon ordinary observation, yet it accepts the goods, it remains liable for any resulting loss [4, 8]. The Court found that Southern Lines was negligent because it admitted the strings of the rice bags were broken and rice was spilled inside the boat's hull, and that its crew members had even misappropriated some of the loose rice [4].

2. **NO.** While Article 366 generally requires a claim to be made within 24 hours as a condition precedent, Southern Lines waived this defense by failing to plead it in its answer, pursuant to Section 10, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court [9]. Furthermore, the Court noted that the action was effectively one for the refund of money paid in excess rather than a simple claim for damages, and the bill of lading did not limit the time for filing an action for a refund [9, 10].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED** and the petition is **DENIED** [10].
