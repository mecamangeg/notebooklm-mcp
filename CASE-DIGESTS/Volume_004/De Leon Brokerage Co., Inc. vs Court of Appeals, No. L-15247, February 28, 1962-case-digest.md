I. CAPTION
DE LEON BROKERAGE CO., INC. v. COURT OF APPEALS and ANGELINE STEEN, G.R. No. L-15247, February 28, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Angeline Steen suffered injuries when the passenger jeepney she was riding collided with a cargo truck owned by petitioner De Leon Brokerage Co., Inc. and driven by its employee, Augusto Luna. Luna was prosecuted and convicted of homicide with physical injuries thru reckless imprudence. In the criminal action, Steen reserved her right to file a separate civil action. Subsequently, she filed a complaint for damages against petitioner and Luna in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, alleging that Luna drove the truck recklessly. To prove negligence, she presented the judgment of conviction. Petitioner argued that the complaint was ambiguous as to whether it was based on quasi-delict or civil liability arising from crime, and claimed Luna was not in the discharge of his duties at the time of the accident as he had deviated from his route. The CFI rendered judgment holding petitioner and Luna solidarily liable, which the Court of Appeals affirmed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the complaint is based on quasi-delict despite the allegation of the driver's criminal conviction.
2. W/N the petitioner employer is liable for the acts of its driver who allegedly deviated from his instructions.
3. W/N the employer and the driver are solidarily liable for the damages.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The complaint is based on quasi-delict. The allegations regarding the employer-employee relationship and the damages caused by the employee on the occasion of his functions clearly state a right of action under Article 2180 of the Civil Code [1]. The reservation of a separate civil action in the criminal case does not preclude a subsequent action based on quasi-delict [2]. The mention of the criminal conviction in the complaint merely tended to support the claim that the driver had been recklessly negligent and was evidentiary in nature [3].

2. **YES.** Petitioner is liable under Article 2180. The judgment of conviction, admitted without objection, established the driver's negligence, giving rise to the presumption that the petitioner was negligent in the selection and supervision of its employees [4]. Regarding the alleged deviation, the driver testified he was returning to Manila after unloading cargo. In the absence of determinative proof that the deviation was so complete as to constitute a cessation or suspension of service, the employer remains liable [5].

3. **YES.** The owners of an establishment or enterprise are solidarily liable with their driver for any accident resulting from the latter's negligent operation of the vehicle under Article 2194 of the Civil Code [6]. Petitioner's reliance on Article 2184 is misplaced, as that provision applies to vehicle owners who are riding in the vehicle at the time of the mishap, whereas Article 2180 applies to owners of enterprises like the petitioner [6].

The petition is DENIED, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.
