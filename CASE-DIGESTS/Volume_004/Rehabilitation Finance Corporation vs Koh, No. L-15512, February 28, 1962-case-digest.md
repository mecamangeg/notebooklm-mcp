I. CAPTION
**REHABILITATION FINANCE CORPORATION v. FRANCISCO T. KOH, et al.**, G.R. No. L-15512, February 28, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On December 5, 1954, petitioner Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC) filed a complaint against respondent Francisco T. Koh and others [1]. RFC alleged two causes of action: (1) Koh, as Vice-President/Treasurer of Villanueva Steamship Co., Inc., obtained a P1,300,000 loan (later released as P1,000,000) through fraud and misrepresentation regarding the company's capital and the value of the vessel "SS Jolly" (renamed "SS Lourdes") intended for purchase [1-3]; and (2) foreclosure/collection due to default on the promissory note [4].

Koh filed an answer with a counterclaim for damages, alleging malicious prosecution [5]. Subsequently, RFC moved to dismiss the complaint and counterclaims due to an amicable settlement [6]. The trial court dismissed the complaint but allowed Koh's counterclaim to proceed [7]. The Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a decision sentencing RFC to pay Koh a total of P479,000 in damages (actual, moral, exemplary, and attorney's fees) for malicious prosecution [8]. RFC appealed to the Supreme Court [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N RFC is liable for damages for malicious prosecution.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the lower court [9].

To support an action for malicious prosecution, three elements must concur: (1) the fact of prosecution and that the defendant was the prosecutor, terminating in acquittal; (2) the prosecutor acted without probable cause; and (3) the prosecutor was actuated by legal malice (improper or sinister motives) [10, 11]. Malice and want of probable cause must both exist to justify the action [12].

Here, RFC had **probable cause** to sue. Evidence showed Koh misrepresented the company's paid-up capital in the loan application (claiming P1,700,000 when it was only P500,000) [13]. He also claimed the vessel's purchase price was $1,148,000, whereas official documents revealed it was only $266,000 [14]. Furthermore, Koh transferred his stocks to his brother to evade signing the promissory note as a solidary debtor, only to reacquire them after the loan release [15].

There was also **no malice**. The investigation was ordered by the President of the Philippines and the Secretary of Justice following a report on the company's activities [16]. The complaint was filed by a committee of counsel based on evidence that the company was in arrears and the vessel was damaged in Hong Kong [16]. Finally, the Court applied the rule that advice of counsel is a complete defense to malicious prosecution when instituted in good faith after a full statement of facts to the attorney [17, 18].

**Decision reversed.**
