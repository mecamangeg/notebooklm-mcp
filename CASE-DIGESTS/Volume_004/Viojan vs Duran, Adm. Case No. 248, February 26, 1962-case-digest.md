I. CAPTION
MEDELINA L. VIOJAN v. RESTITUTO M. DURAN, Adm. Case No. 248, February 26, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Medelina L. Viojan filed a petition for disbarment against Respondent Restituto M. Duran, the Justice of the Peace of Basey, Samar [1]. Previously, Viojan had filed an administrative complaint charging Duran with rape, but the investigating District Judge found that the sexual intercourse was consensual [1, 2]. However, because Viojan was a married woman, Duran was found guilty of immorality (adultery) [3, 4]. Consequently, the President issued Administrative Order No. 148 suspending Duran from office for six months without pay [5, 6]. Respondent served this suspension from November 1955 to May 1956 [4]. Viojan filed this petition arguing that the penalty was too lenient and demanded Duran's disbarment or further suspension from the practice of law [4, 7]. The Solicitor General recommended dismissal, arguing that Duran had already been sufficiently punished and that the act was made possible by Viojan's own conduct [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N respondent should be disbarred or suspended from the practice of law for immorality.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court recognized that the respondent's immorality was condemnable, stating that a Justice of the Peace is a high government official who must be "above and beyond reproach, not only in his private, but also in his public or official conduct" [10]. By committing the act, he violated the trust of his office and the strict moral standards of the law profession [10].

However, the Court decided against further disciplinary action. It reasoned that: (1) the respondent had already undergone a six-month suspension from office without pay; (2) a further suspension from the Bar would effectively prolong his suspension from his office as Justice of the Peace; and (3) the immorality was "made possible partly by the rather equivocal conduct of complainant herself" [11].

Accordingly, the petition was dismissed, with a warning that a repetition of a similar offense would be dealt with more severely [11].
