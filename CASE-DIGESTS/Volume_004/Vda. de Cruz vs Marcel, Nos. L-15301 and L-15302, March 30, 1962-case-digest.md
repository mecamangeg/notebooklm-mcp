I. CAPTION
MARIA CONCEPCION PAEZ VDA. DE CRUZ, in her capacity as Administratrix of the Intestate Estate of Don PEDRO B. CRUZ v. TOBIAS P. MARCELO, G.R. Nos. L-15301 and L-15302, March 30, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Pedro B. Cruz was granted a certificate of public convenience (CPC) in 1951 to operate a 15-ton ice plant in Tondo, Manila. After his death, his administratrix (petitioner) filed an application in 1957 to substitute equipment and transfer the site. However, Tobias P. Marcelo (respondent) and another operator petitioned for the cancellation of Cruz's CPC on the ground of abandonment. An inspection by the Public Service Commission (PSC) revealed that the ice plant had been converted into a pig pen and the equipment was only being delivered during the inspection.

Consequently, the PSC cancelled Cruz's CPC for abandonment and dismissed the petitioner's application for substitution. After the cancellation became final, four operators, including petitioner and respondent, applied for the vacated 15-ton capacity. Finding all applicants financially capable but deeming it impractical to split the tonnage, the PSC granted the certificate to respondent Marcelo based on the priority of the date of filing. Petitioner appealed, arguing she should be preferred under the "old operator rule."

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner can avail of the "old operator rule" to claim preference in the grant of the certificate despite the previous abandonment of service.
2. W/N the PSC erred in applying the "priority of filing" rule in awarding the certificate to the respondent.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The "old operator rule," which protects investments of operators willing and able to serve, is not absolute. It does not apply where the old operator failed to improve or complete the service, or as in this case, abandoned it. The Court held that abandonment is a sufficient cause for cancellation because public necessity cannot wait for private convenience. Furthermore, abandonment is a violation of law; since the petitioner's predecessor violated the law by converting the plant into a pig pen, the successor-in-interest cannot claim any right of preference (*Buenaflor vs. Camarines Sur Industry Corp.*).

2. **NO.** The Court upheld the PSC's discretion. While priority of application is not usually the controlling factor, it becomes an important factor when all other conditions are equal among qualified applicants (*Batangas Transportation Co. vs. Orlanes*). Since all applicants were capable and splitting the unit was impractical, the PSC correctly applied the priority rule.

The decision of the Public Service Commission is **AFFIRMED**.
