I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GUILLERMO I. VENTURA, G.R. No. L-15079, January 31, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Guillermo I. Ventura, who had a prior conviction for illegal practice of medicine in 1949, was charged with the same offense in 1955 [1]. The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) conducted a sting operation where an agent, Natayan, posed as a patient complaining of back pain [1]. Ventura diagnosed him with "lumbago," prescribed a treatment involving an enema and exposure to heat bulbs, and charged a fee [1]. Ventura admitted to practicing as a "naturopathic physician" for 35 years without a medical license, treating ailments without drugs using electricity, water, and hands [2]. He claimed he had an implied license because government officials and countless people engaged his services [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal convicted him of violating Section 770 in connection with Section 2678 of the Revised Administrative Code [5]. Ventura appealed, questioning the constitutionality of the medical laws and claiming the government was estopped from prosecuting him [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Ventura's "drugless healing" without a license constitutes illegal practice of medicine.
2. W/N the laws requiring medical licenses are unconstitutional for curtailing the right to pursue a calling.
3. W/N the government is estopped from prosecuting Ventura because officials allegedly encouraged his practice.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Treating human ailments by means of drugless healing without the required license constitutes illegal practice of medicine [7]. The Court found that Ventura diagnosed patients and applied remedies on his own without a written order or prescription from a registered physician [8]. His claim of practicing "physiotherapy" was rejected because he acted independently rather than under a physician's guidance [8].

2. **NO.** It is within the police power of the State to require that persons who devote themselves to curing human ills possess thorough knowledge for proper diagnosis [9]. The State may prescribe regulations to secure the general welfare and protect the public against ignorance, incapacity, and fraud [10]. The requirement of a license does not violate the constitutional right to life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness [9, 11].

3. **NO.** The government is never estopped by the mistakes or errors of its agents [12]. Even if officials had encouraged his practice, the State cannot bargain away public health and safety for the semblance of benefit to a few [12]. Furthermore, a license cannot be implied from the fact that he was permitted to serve in a sanitarium or that the public persisted in engaging him, as repetition of illegal acts does not make them legal [4].

**Decision affirmed.** [8]
