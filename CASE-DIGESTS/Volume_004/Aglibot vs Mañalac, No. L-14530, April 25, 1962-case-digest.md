I. CAPTION
LEONA AGLIBOT, ET AL. v. ANDREA ACAY MAÑALAC, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14530, April 25, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
The subject property is a parcel of land in Zambales covered by Original Certificate of Title No. 10, originally owned by the conjugal partnership of Anacleto Mañalac and his first wife, Maria Aglibot [1]. When Maria died in 1906, her one-half share was inherited by their only daughter, Juliana Mañalac [1]. Anacleto later married Andrea Acay, with whom he had six children [1].

In 1920, Juliana died intestate without descendants, and her one-half share was inherited by her father, Anacleto [1]. Anacleto died in 1942, and his second wife Andrea and their children took possession of the property [1]. Leona and Evarista Aglibot, sisters of Maria Aglibot (Juliana's maternal aunts), filed an action to recover the one-half portion, arguing it was reservable property [2, 3]. The lower court declared the Aglibots owners of the one-half portion and ordered Andrea and her children jointly and severally to deliver possession and pay damages of 15 cavans of palay yearly [4]. The defendants appealed, claiming the property was part of Anacleto's estate inherited by his second family [1, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the property inherited by Anacleto from his daughter Juliana is subject to *reserva troncal* in favor of the Aglibots.
2. W/N the appellants are jointly and severally liable for the fruits of the land.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the land is reservable property pursuant to Article 811 of the Spanish Civil Code (now Article 891 of the New Civil Code) [6]. The property originated from the maternal line (Maria Aglibot), was inherited by a descendant (Juliana), and was subsequently transmitted by operation of law to an ascendant (Anacleto) upon Juliana's death without issue [6]. Consequently, Anacleto was obliged to reserve the portion he inherited from Juliana for the benefit of relatives within the third degree belonging to the line from which the property came [6]. Leona and Evarista Aglibot, being sisters of Maria and maternal aunts of Juliana, are relatives within the third degree of the maternal line and are entitled to the property [6].

2. **NO.** The Court modified the decision regarding damages, holding that the liability should not be joint and several [7]. Evidence showed that only the widow, Andrea Acay, enjoyed the possession of the property and received the share pertaining to the landlord after Anacleto's death [7]. Therefore, she alone is sentenced to pay the 15 cavans of palay yearly from the date of the filing of the complaint [7].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that only Andrea Acay is liable for the damages [8].
