I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF CANDELARIA BENGUAN, DECEASED. SUSANA ABAY DE ARROYO v. FRANCISCO ABAY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15814, February 28, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On January 5, 1956, petitioner Susana Abay de Arroyo filed a petition for the probate of the will of Candelaria Benguan (Special Proceedings No. 3883) in the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental. Opponents-appellees Francisco Abay and others filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the petition was barred by a previous dismissal. It appeared that a prior petition for the probate of the same will (Special Proceedings No. 3623) had been filed by Felix Abay but was dismissed when he and his counsel failed to appear at the hearing. The order dismissing the previous petition did not state that it was "without prejudice." The lower court granted the motion and dismissed Susana's petition. Susana appealed, arguing that the previous dismissal was not an adjudication on the merits and should not bar her petition.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of a previous petition for probate due to the non-appearance of the petitioner bars a subsequent petition for the probate of the same will.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the order of dismissal. The Court ruled that the dismissal of the previous petition for failure to appear was not an adjudication on the merits. It held that the provisions of Sections 3 and 4, Rule 30 (regarding dismissal of actions) and Section 2, Rule 73 of the Rules of Court cannot apply to probate proceedings [1].

The Court reasoned that the probate of a will usually concerns several persons, and the fault or negligence of one petitioner (Felix Abay) should not prejudice the rights of other interested parties (Susana Abay de Arroyo) [1]. Furthermore, it is the policy of the State to ensure that wills are submitted for probate and legalization, as evidenced by the penalties imposed on persons who fail to deliver wills to the court under Sections 2 to 5, Rule 76 [1].

The Order of dismissal was set aside and the petition remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [2].
