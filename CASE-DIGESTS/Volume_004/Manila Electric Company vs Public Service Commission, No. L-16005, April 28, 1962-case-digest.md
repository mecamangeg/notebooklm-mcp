**I. CAPTION**
MANILA ELECTRIC COMPANY v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-16005, April 28, 1962, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
On November 24, 1958, the Public Service Commission (PSC) authorized Manila Electric Company (Meralco) to install a new electric generating unit at its Rockwell Steam Plant [1]. Subsequently, the PSC ordered Meralco to pay ₱27,346.80 as a permit fee for the increase in capacity, calculated based on the additional investment [1]. Meralco moved for reconsideration, refusing to pay. It argued that under Section 40 of the Public Service Act (Commonwealth Act No. 146, as amended) and its legislative franchise, it is exempt from such fees because it already pays 5% of its earnings "in lieu of all taxes and assessments" [2, 3]. The PSC denied the motion [2]. Meralco appealed to the Supreme Court on the sole issue of the legality of the imposed permit fee [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Meralco is exempt from paying the PSC permit fee based on its legislative franchise and the Public Service Act.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that Meralco is not exempt. While Meralco's legislative franchise provides that the payment of 5% of its earnings is in lieu of "taxes and assessments," it does not expressly exempt the petitioner from the payment of "fees" or permit fees [4]. The Court presumed that lawmakers were familiar with the distinction between taxes (*impuestos*) and fees (*derechos*) when drafting the franchise [4]. Furthermore, exemptions from public burdens must be strictly construed against the claimant and in favor of the State; they cannot be permitted to exist upon vague implication [4]. Since the franchise did not clearly grant an exemption from regulatory fees, the assessment was valid.

The decision of the Public Service Commission is affirmed [5].
