**I. CAPTION**
FERMIN U. IMBUIDO v. ATTY. FIDEL SOR. MANGONON, Adm. Case No. 200, March 31, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Fermin Imbuido sold 10 parcels of land in Pangasinan to Maria Gonzales with a right to repurchase (*pacto de retro*). Imbuido failed to redeem the property by the deadline, allowing Gonzales to consolidate ownership and obtain a new title [1]. Imbuido then engaged Respondent Atty. Mangonon to negotiate the redemption of the lands, though no specific agreement on fees was made [2, 3]. Imbuido raised P4,600 from previous creditors to fund the repurchase. Respondent successfully negotiated the resale for P4,056 but, contrary to Imbuido's instructions and without his knowledge, had the deed of resale executed in Respondent’s own name [3, 4]. Respondent then conveyed some parcels to the creditors but kept two parcels for himself, claiming them as attorney's fees [4, 5]. Imbuido filed a civil action for recovery in the Court of First Instance, which ruled in his favor, and subsequently filed this administrative complaint for malpractice [6]. Respondent denied the lawyer-client relationship, claiming he represented the creditors [7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Respondent committed a breach of professional duty warranting disciplinary action.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court found Respondent guilty of professional misconduct. Evidence, specifically a letter written by Respondent to Gonzales signing as "Attorney for Mayor Fermin U. Imbuido," established the existence of a lawyer-client relationship [8, 9]. Respondent committed a serious breach of professional duty and trust by executing the deed of resale in his own name instead of his client’s [9]. Even if Respondent had been representing the creditors as he claimed, common sense dictated that reconveyance should be in the name of the vendor (Imbuido) [10]. Furthermore, Respondent was not justified in retaining two parcels of land as attorney's fees, as there was no evidence to support such a claim [5].

The Court ordered the return of the two parcels of land to Petitioner, without prejudice to a separate action for determining proper fees [5].

**ACCORDINGLY**, Respondent is **SUSPENDED** from the practice of law for one (1) year [11].
