I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE AMERICAN DRUG CO. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and ALBERTO CUADRA, G.R. No. L-15162, April 18, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Alberto Cuadra, a dismissed employee formerly holding the position of Sales Supervisor, invoked his "preferential right to employment" to claim the position of Legaspi branch manager after the incumbent, Fidelino, was dismissed [1, 2]. Petitioner Philippine American Drug Co. instead appointed an outsider, Garcia, to the position [2, 3]. Cuadra filed a case with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) asking to dismiss Garcia and appoint him instead [2]. The CIR ruled in favor of Cuadra, deeming him more qualified than Garcia and ordering the petitioner to pay Cuadra the difference between what he would have received as branch manager and his actual earnings from December 1, 1957, to June 30, 1958 [1, 3]. The petitioner appealed, arguing that the branch manager position was higher than Cuadra's former post and thus not covered by his preferential right.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a dismissed employee's preferential right to re-employment includes appointment to a position higher than that formerly occupied.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CIR's order. The Court defined "reinstatement" as the restoration to a state from which one has been removed or separated; consequently, a court cannot order the reinstatement of a dismissed employee to a position they had not previously occupied [4, 5]. The Court held that a "preferential right to employment" is a lesser right than reinstatement [4, 6]. Since reinstatement is strictly limited to the former position or substantially equivalent employment, the preferential right cannot be expanded to compel appointment to a higher position [6, 7]. The position of branch manager was determined to be higher than Cuadra's former position of sales supervisor [7]. The Court noted that even if Cuadra were still an active employee, he could only *hope* for a promotion but could not *compel* the petitioner to grant it [8].

The appealed order is reversed, and the petitioner is absolved from all liability to Cuadra [8].
