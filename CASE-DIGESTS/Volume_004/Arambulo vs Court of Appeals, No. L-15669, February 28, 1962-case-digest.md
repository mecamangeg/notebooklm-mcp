I. CAPTION
SEVERINO ARAMBULO v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and THE MUNICIPALITY OF CALAMBA, G.R. No. L-15669, February 28, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Mayor Arambulo dismissed three patrolmen. The Court of First Instance (CFI) declared the removal illegal and ordered reinstatement. The patrolmen sued Arambulo in his personal capacity in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Calamba for back salaries. Arambulo filed a third-party complaint against the Municipality of Calamba, which admitted liability. The JP Court rendered judgment ordering the Municipality to pay and absolving Arambulo. The patrolmen appealed to the CFI only insofar as the decision absolved Arambulo. The Municipality did not appeal.

Pending the appeal, the JP Court issued a writ of execution against the Municipality, and the CFI issued an *alias* writ. The Municipality moved to set aside the writ and intervene in the appeal, arguing that the patrolmen's appeal vacated the JP judgment entirely. The CFI denied the motions, ruling the judgment was final and executory against the non-appealing Municipality. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the CFI, setting aside the execution and allowing the intervention.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal taken by the plaintiffs (patrolmen) against the defendant (Mayor) vacated the judgment of the Justice of the Peace Court as regards the third-party defendant (Municipality) that did not appeal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision. Under Section 9, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court, an appeal from an inferior court to the CFI considers the case "as though the same had never been tried before and had been originally there commenced." The appeal vacates the judgment of the inferior court not only as between the appellant and appellee but also as to the third-party defendant who has not appealed. Effectively, all proceedings in the inferior court, including the judgment, are deemed inexistent, and the appeal reopens all issues previously passed upon, regardless of who appealed (*Royal Shirt Factory, Inc. v. Co Bon Tic*). Furthermore, under Section 8, Rule 39, the CFI had no power to issue an *alias* writ of execution for a judgment rendered by the JP Court.

The petition is denied, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
