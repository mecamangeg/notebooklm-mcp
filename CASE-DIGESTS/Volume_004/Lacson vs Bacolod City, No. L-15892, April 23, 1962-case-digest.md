I. CAPTION
FERNANDO LACSON and SIMPLICIO A. PALANCA v. BACOLOD CITY, TEOFISTO E. CORDOVA, and ALFREDO TAMBASEN, G.R. No. L-15892, April 23, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants Lacson and Palanca, theater owners in Bacolod City, filed a suit to annul two city ordinances: (1) Ordinance No. 48, series of 1949, which imposed a fixed annual fee of P1,500.00 for the operation of theaters in addition to a P30.00 permit fee; and (2) Ordinance No. 185, as amended by Ordinance No. 191, series of 1957, which imposed a "tax" of P0.05 and P0.10 on every admission ticket. Plaintiffs argued the ordinances were *ultra vires* and void. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental upheld Ordinance No. 48 as valid but declared Ordinances Nos. 185 and 191 *ultra vires* and invalid. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Ordinance No. 48 imposing a fixed annual fee of P1,500.00 is valid.
2. W/N Ordinances Nos. 185 and 191 imposing amounts on admission tickets are valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that Ordinance No. 48 is valid. There is no repugnance between the annual permit fee of P30.00, which is for the issuance of a permit to open the theater, and the fixed annual fee of P1,500.00, which is for the supervision of the theatrical business throughout the year [1]. The matter of classification and the amount reasonably needed for regulatory purposes are addressed to the judgment and discretion of the City Council [2].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the imposition of additional amounts on admission tickets is invalid. Relying on *Zosimo Rojas & Bros. v. City of Cavite* and *Arong v. Raffiñan*, the Court held that such exactions are in reality taxes that cannot be collected in the guise of license fees [3]. The City cannot resort to the General Welfare Clause as a source of the power to tax [4]. Additionally, the ordinances expressly labeled the payments as a "tax" intended for the General Fund, further indicating they were for revenue rather than regulation [4].

The judgment of the lower court is AFFIRMED [5].
