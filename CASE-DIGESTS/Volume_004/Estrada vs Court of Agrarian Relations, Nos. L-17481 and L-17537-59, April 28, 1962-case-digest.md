I. CAPTION
LIBERATA ANTONIO ESTRADA, ET AL. v. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS and FAUSTINO F. GALVAN, G.R. Nos. L-17481 and L-17537-59, April 28, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners are tenants of respondent Dr. Faustino F. Galvan on land in Pangasinan. In January 1960, the tenants filed petitions with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) demanding a change in the crop-sharing ratio for rice (from 50-50 to 70-30), tobacco (to 2/3-1/3), and mongo (to 80-20), alleging they contributed all items of production and that the previous sharing ratios were unfair or contrary to custom. Respondent Galvan countered that the 50-50 sharing was based on contracts and custom since 1952, noting he supplied farm implements, advanced seedlings and fertilizers, and contributed P20.00 per hectare for transplanting and harrowing expenses. Galvan subsequently filed a petition to eject the tenants for various violations, including refusal to use his thresher, harvesting tobacco without reporting the amount, and employing sub-tenants without consent.

The CAR dismissed the tenants' petitions and granted the landlord's petition for ejectment, finding that the landlord did contribute to production expenses and that the tenants committed the alleged violations. The court upheld the 50-50 sharing basis.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the tenants are entitled to change the rice crop sharing arrangement from 50-50 to 70-30.
2. W/N the mongo crop should be classified as an auxiliary crop entitled to an 80-20 sharing ratio.
3. W/N the tobacco crop sharing should be changed to 70-30.
4. W/N the ejectment of the tenants was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 14 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act (R.A. No. 1199), a change in crop sharing from 50-50 to 70-30 cannot be made by the tenant unless they use their own farm implements and carabao, and spend for the last harrowing and transplanting without contribution from the landlord. The Court affirmed the lower court's findings that the landlord owned the farm implements and contributed P20.00 per hectare for the last harrowing and transplanting expenses [1].

2. **NO.** The mongo was planted on upland portions ("bankag") as a principal crop, not an auxiliary crop; thus, Section 30 of R.A. No. 1199 regarding auxiliary crops does not apply. Instead, it is governed by Section 41 ("Crops Other than Rice"), which stipulates that sharing depends on the contract or the custom of the place. The evidence showed the custom was 50-50 [2], [3].

3. **NO.** Similar to the mongo crop, the tobacco was grown on a commercial basis as a principal crop. Under Section 41 of R.A. No. 1199, the sharing is governed by the contract or local custom, both of which established a 50-50 basis. Furthermore, the landlord reimbursed seeds and costs for fertilizers and insecticides as provided in Section 28, justifying the maintenance of the agreed ratio [4], [5].

4. **YES.** The Court upheld the ejectment based on findings that the tenants violated the law and landlord's instructions by: (1) harvesting and curing tobacco without the landlord's knowledge or consent; (2) planting corn instead of palay against orders; (3) sundrying tobacco against orders; and (4) employing sub-tenants without permission [5], [6].

The petitions are DENIED and the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations is AFFIRMED.
