I. CAPTION
PARSONS HARDWARE CO., INC. and HON. JUDGE ARSENIO SOLIDUM v. MARIANO MEDINA, G.R. No. L-14206, February 28, 1962, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Parsons Hardware Co., Inc. sued Respondent Mariano Medina for a sum of money in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI rendered a decision against Medina [1]. Medina appealed, but the trial judge ordered him to amend his record on appeal on February 8, 1958, giving him five days to comply [1, 2]. Medina failed to file the amended record within the period. The court granted a *sua sponte* extension on March 1, 1958, but Medina again failed to comply, filing instead a "Constancia" and a "Mocion" to insert documents, which were denied [3-5].

Medina finally filed the amended record on appeal on April 1, 1958, only after receiving the petitioner's motion for execution [6]. On April 12, 1958, the CFI disapproved the amended record for being filed out of time and granted the writ of execution [7]. Medina filed a petition for mandamus with the Court of Appeals (CA), which granted the petition on the ground of liberality [7, 8]. Parsons Hardware appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial judge committed grave abuse of discretion in disapproving the amended record on appeal filed beyond the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial judge acted correctly and did not commit any abuse of discretion. Under Section 7, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, if the judge orders the amendment of the record, the appellant must redraft and submit it "within the time limited in the order, or such extension thereof as may be granted" [9].

The Court cited the rule that if a record on appeal is filed outside the reglementary period, it is discretionary upon the trial judge to approve or disapprove it. Mandamus will only lie if the judge "manifestly and grossly abused his discretion" (*Lituaña v. Oliveros*; *Bustamante v. Tirona*) [10]. Here, Medina failed to submit the amended record despite extensions and gave no reason for the delay, complying only after facing a motion for execution [10]. The Court rejected the CA's reliance on "liberality," stating that mere "intention to obey" evinced by filing motions is not compliance, and unreasonable liberality hampers judicial processes [8, 11]. Consequently, the appeal was never perfected under Section 9, Rule 41, and the judgment became final [10].

The decision of the Court of Appeals was set aside and the order of the Court of First Instance was affirmed [12].
