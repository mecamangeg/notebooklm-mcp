**I. CAPTION**
LINO GUTIERREZ v. LUCIANO L. MEDEL and LUZ P. MEDEL, G.R. No. L-14455, April 26, 1962, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
On December 20, 1957, Lino Gutierrez filed a complaint against Luciano and Luz Medel for the recovery of a P10,000.00 loan secured by a second real estate mortgage [1]. The defendants admitted the loan's existence but alleged a verbal extension to pay [2].

The trial court granted several postponements. On March 28, 1958, the court granted a continuance to May 16, 1958, "for the last time," warning that if defendants were unprepared, the case would be submitted for decision [3]. On May 13, 1958, a new counsel for the defendants, Atty. Tolentino, filed an "Urgent Motion For Transfer" alleging a conflict with another trial [3]. On the scheduled May 16 hearing, neither the defendants, their new counsel, nor their original counsel of record (Atty. Billostas) appeared [3]. The trial court denied the motion and submitted the case for decision based on plaintiff's evidence, subsequently ruling in favor of Gutierrez [4]. The defendants appealed, claiming the denial of the postponement deprived them of their day in court [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the trial court erred in denying the motion for postponement, thereby depriving the defendants of their day in court.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the defendants were not deprived of their day in court. The trial court was liberal in granting three prior postponements and explicitly warned the defendants that the May 16 hearing was the "last time" [5].

The Court applied the rule that a party moving for postponement should be in court on the day set for trial if the motion is not acted upon favorably before that day; they have no right to rely on the liberality of the court (*Macondray & Co. v. Paredes*; *Sunico v. Villapando*) [6]. Furthermore, an attorney who cannot appear due to a conflict has no right to presume a continuance will be granted; the ethical course is to inform the client so they may retain another attorney (*Linis v. Rovira*) [7]. The defendants and their original counsel, who had not withdrawn, failed to appear, assuming their motion would be granted [8].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [9].
