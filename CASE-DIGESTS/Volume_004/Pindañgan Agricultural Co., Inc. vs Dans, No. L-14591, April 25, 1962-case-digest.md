I. CAPTION
PINDAÑGAN AGRICULTURAL COMPANY, INC. v. JOSE P. DANS, in his capacity as Director of the Bureau of Lands, et al., G.R. No. L-14591, April 25, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
The subject property involves 491 hectares of agricultural land in Alcala, Pangasinan, originally owned by Cristina Gonzales but foreclosed by the Government in 1922. Former tenants formed the plaintiff corporation, Pindañgan Agricultural Company, Inc., to facilitate the acquisition of the land. The corporation filed Lease Application No. 109 and a Sales Application dated July 9, 1949.

On October 4, 1949, the Director of Lands rejected the corporation’s applications. An investigation revealed that the land was actually occupied by 178 individuals, some of whom were stockholders of the corporation, who wished to acquire the land individually and had lost confidence in the corporation. The Director held that breaking up the estate to sell to actual occupants was consistent with state policy. The Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources dismissed the corporation's appeal.

The corporation filed a petition for mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan, alleging the officials acted with grave abuse of discretion and without due process because the investigation was conducted *ex parte*. The CFI ruled in favor of the corporation, annulling the administrative orders and directing the officials to give due course to the corporation's applications. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance erred in disturbing the decision of the administrative officials.
2. W/N the Director of Lands and Secretary of Agriculture acted with grave abuse of discretion in preferring the actual occupants over the plaintiff corporation.
3. W/N the *ex parte* investigation conducted by the Bureau of Lands was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that decisions of administrative officers shall not be disturbed by the courts, except when the former have acted without or in excess of their jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion. Under Section 4 of the Public Land Act (Commonwealth Act No. 141), the disposition of public lands is lodged exclusively in the Director of Lands, subject only to the control of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Consequently, courts have no power to review, reverse, or modify his decisions as approved by the Secretary, absent a showing of grave abuse.

2. **NO.** The Court found no abuse of discretion. The officials' decision to prefer the 178 actual occupants over the corporation was in accordance with the well-established policy of the State to break up big landed estates and enable occupants or tenants to acquire small landholdings (citing *Republic Act No. 1400* and *Republic Act No. 1160*). The corporation had no pre-emption right; its prior opposition to the original owner's repurchase did not create a right to be preferred over the actual occupants.

3. **YES.** The Court ruled that the absence of the plaintiff during the investigation was not fatal. There is no law or regulation requiring that investigations by land administrative officers be conducted in the presence of all interested parties. The investigation was merely fact-finding, not a trial, and the lack of notice did not invalidate the findings that the occupants desired independent land ownership.

**Decision set aside and petition dismissed.**
