I. CAPTION
MENELEO B. BERNARDEZ v. HON. FRANCISCO T. VALERA, as Justice of the Peace of Bangued, Abra, G.R. No. L-18462, April 13, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On February 18, 1961, in Bangued, Abra, petitioner Meneleo Bernardez allegedly shot and wounded Atty. Pedro Benedito and killed Cpl. Reinerio Buenafe. Bernardez was initially charged with frustrated murder, and bail was fixed at P15,000.00. However, on February 21, 1961, an amended complaint for Murder and Frustrated Murder was filed, alleging evident premeditation and treachery. Consequently, respondent Judge Valera issued a warrant recommending no bail. Bernardez voluntarily surrendered and filed a motion for bail. The prosecution opposed the motion, arguing that the charge was a capital offense and the evidence of guilt was strong. To prove this, the prosecution submitted affidavits, including that of the victim Benedito, which described a confrontation and shooting following a prior dispute. The respondent Judge denied the motion for bail, prompting Bernardez to file this petition.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused is entitled to bail despite being charged with Murder, a capital offense.

IV. RULING
**YES.** A person charged with a capital offense is not entitled to bail only if the evidence of his guilt is strong. The Supreme Court reviewed the evidence submitted by the prosecution to the respondent judge, specifically the sworn statement of the victim Benedito, and found that it failed to sufficiently establish the qualifying circumstances of evident premeditation or treachery (*alevosia*). The Court held that the evidence presented could prove, at most, Homicide and not Murder. Since the evidence of guilt for the specific capital offense charged was not strong, the accused is entitled to bail.

The order of the respondent judge denying the motion was set aside, and the respondent was directed to order the release of the petitioner upon the filing and approval of a bail bond in the sum of P25,000.00.
