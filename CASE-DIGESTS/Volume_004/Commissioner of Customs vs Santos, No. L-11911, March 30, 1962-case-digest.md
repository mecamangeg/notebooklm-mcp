I. CAPTION
THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS v. ENOC C. SANTOS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-11911, March 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On May 4, 1954, 71 cases of merchandise arrived from Hong Kong consigned to respondent Enoc C. Santos. The shipment was declared under Entry No. 07299 and covered by a Central Bank release certificate. Upon examination, three cases declared as "Bags and Sacks, Cotton" were found to contain 500 dozens of ladies' purses with imitation beads. These items were classified as banned articles under Commodity Code No. 830114-UI and were seized for violation of Central Bank Circular No. 44 in relation to Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code.

The goods were released pending proceedings upon the filing of a bond. The Collector of Customs ordered the forfeiture of the articles and the payment of P3,000.00 indemnity, which was affirmed by the Commissioner of Customs. On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) reversed the decision, ruling that the Central Bank lacked the power to issue Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 to regulate imports not involving the sale of foreign exchange (no-dollar imports).

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Central Bank has the authority to issue Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 regulating no-dollar imports.
2. W/N the importer can attack the validity of the circular's implementation due to lack of publication in the Official Gazette.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Central Bank has the authority to issue Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 even if they regulate no-dollar importations. Relying on *Commissioner of Customs v. Eastern Sea Trading* (G.R. No. L-14279), the Court held that the broad powers of the Central Bank under its charter (Republic Act No. 265) to maintain monetary stability and preserve the international value of the currency connote the authority to regulate no-dollar imports, given the influence such imports have on the stability of the Philippine peso.

2. **NO.** The importer is estopped from challenging the validity of the circular or its implementation. The Court ruled that since Santos took advantage of Circular No. 44 to secure the release certificate for his importation, he cannot subsequently attack its validity or the lack of publication of the commodity classifications when the license is sought to be revoked. A party cannot "approbate and reprobate" or occupy inconsistent positions (*Magdalena Estate, Inc. v. Myrick*).

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is REVERSED, and the decision of the Collector of Customs is AFFIRMED.
