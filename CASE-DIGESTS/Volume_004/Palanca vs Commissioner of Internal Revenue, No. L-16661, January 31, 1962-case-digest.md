**I. CAPTION**
CLARA DILUANGCO PALANCA, ET AL. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16661, January 31, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Gliceria Diluangco died in 1947. Her executor failed to file tax returns until required by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) in 1951. Taxes were assessed, and a warrant of distraint and levy was issued on March 5, 1952. However, the warrant was not executed because the executor requested a reinvestigation and constructive levy. Following a re-assessment, a new warrant was issued on June 23, 1955, within the five-year prescriptive period. This warrant was served on the executor’s secretary, but the executor again requested suspension to clarify the amounts due from each heir. The heirs eventually raised the defense of prescription, arguing that the government’s right to collect had expired because the warrant was not fully executed (no property was seized) within the statutory period. The Court of Tax Appeals ruled that the collection had not prescribed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the government's right to collect the estate and inheritance taxes has prescribed.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court affirmed the Court of Tax Appeals, holding that the right to collect has not prescribed. Under Section 332(c) of the National Internal Revenue Code, a tax may be collected by distraint or levy if the proceeding is *begun* within five years after assessment. The Supreme Court established that the summary remedy of distraint and levy is effectively **begun by the issuance of the warrant of distraint and levy**. It is not necessary for the warrant to be actually executed or for properties to be seized to stop the running of the prescriptive period [1, 2]. Furthermore, the Court noted that the delay in execution was not due to the government's voluntary desistance but rather the petitioners' repeated requests for reinvestigation and postponement; allowing prescription to run under such circumstances would allow taxpayers to prejudice the government through their own delays [3].

**Decision affirmed.**
