I. CAPTION
NATIVIDAD VERNUS-SANCIANGCO v. DIOSDADO SANCIANGCO, et al., G.R. No. L-16219, April 28, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On July 16, 1951, Natividad Vernus-Sanciangco filed an action against her husband, Diosdado Sanciangco, and others for judicial separation of conjugal properties and the annulment of certain sales, alleging abandonment since 1919. The case remained pending for four years, during which at least seven postponements were granted, mostly at the instance of the plaintiff. On the scheduled hearing of September 6, 1955, plaintiff's counsel appeared without her, requesting a postponement or leave to withdraw because they could not contact their client. The defendants objected, citing the long delay. The trial court denied the motion and dismissed the case. The plaintiff appealed, arguing abuse of discretion.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial judge abused his discretion in dismissing the complaint for failure to prosecute.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal of a case for failure of the plaintiff to appear at trial or to prosecute the action depends upon the sound discretion of the trial judge, as authorized by the Rules of Court [1]. The Court found no abuse of discretion considering the case had been pending for four years with five previous postponements requested by the plaintiff, and that she failed to notify her counsel or the post office of her change of address [2]. Furthermore, the Court noted that her claim lacked merit, given the spouses' separation since 1924 and an alleged 1926 agreement liquidating their assets [2]. The order of dismissal was affirmed [3].
