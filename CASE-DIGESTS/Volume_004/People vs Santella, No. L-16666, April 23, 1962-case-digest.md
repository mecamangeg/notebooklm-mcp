I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. IRINEO SANTELLA**, G.R. No. L-16666, April 23, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On October 28, 1957, during an election campaign in Ilocos Sur, Mayor Sabala and the deceased, Atty. Arnulfo Arcalas, met in Barrio Sabang. They belonged to opposing political factions. During an altercation regarding their campaigns, Arcalas criticized the Mayor for failing to discipline his men, specifically citing an incident earlier that day where the accused, Irineo Santella (a policeman and the Mayor's escort), dragged Arcalas' driver [1].

Enraged by the imputation, Santella approached Arcalas, boxed him, and loaded his carbine. When Arcalas pointed to his driver in a nearby jeep to confirm the story, Santella fired at Arcalas, causing him to fall. Santella then approached the fallen victim and fired several more shots, declaring, "I will finish you all" [2]. He also fired at Vice-Mayor Santos Sabio, who managed to escape.

The Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur convicted Santella of Murder (for the death of Arcalas) and Illegal Discharge of Firearm (for firing at Sabio) [3]. Santella appealed, claiming self-defense. He alleged that Arcalas had boxed him and appeared to be reaching for a gun tucked in his waist, prompting Santella to fire a single shot to defend himself [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused acted in self-defense.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court held that the appellant's theory of self-defense—specifically his claim that he fired only once—was completely belied by the physical evidence [6]. The body of the deceased sustained **several** gunshot wounds, two of which were located on his **back** [6, 7]. This physical evidence conclusively refuted the defense's version of events and supported the prosecution's testimony that Santella fired multiple times at the victim, including while he was already down. The decision appealed from was affirmed with costs against the appellant [7].
