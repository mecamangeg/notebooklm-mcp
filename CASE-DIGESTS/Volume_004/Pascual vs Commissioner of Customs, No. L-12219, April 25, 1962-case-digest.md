I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO PASCUAL v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-12219, April 25, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On August 9, 1954, a shipment of coffee and chocolate valued at $550.00 consigned to petitioner Francisco Pascual arrived in Manila. The shipment was not covered by a release certificate from the Central Bank. Consequently, the Collector of Customs seized the goods under Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code (RAC) in relation to Central Bank Circular Nos. 44 and 45. The shipment was released upon the filing of a surety bond.

The Collector of Customs ordered the forfeiture of the bond. This decision was affirmed by the Commissioner of Customs and subsequently by the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). Pascual appealed, arguing that Central Bank Circular No. 44 does not provide for the penalty of forfeiture and that the Central Bank Act (Republic Act No. 265) only penalizes violations with fine or imprisonment, not forfeiture.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the shipment is subject to forfeiture under the Revised Administrative Code for violation of Central Bank Circular No. 44.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that while Central Bank Circular No. 44 does not explicitly provide for the penalty of forfeiture, it is subject to enforcement by the Bureau of Customs and is deemed part of the customs law under Section 1419 of the Revised Administrative Code [1, 2].

Therefore, a shipment imported in violation of said Circular is subject to forfeiture under Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code, which specifically provides that all merchandise "imported contrary to law" is subject to forfeiture [1-3]. The Court reiterated that a duly issued circular has the force and effect of law [2, 4, 5]. Furthermore, the Circular makes no distinction between merchandise of "prohibited importation" and those "imported contrary to law"; it punishes importation effected without a release certificate regardless of the nature of the goods [4-6].

Decision affirmed [7, 8].
