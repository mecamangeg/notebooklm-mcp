I. CAPTION
NATIONAL SHIPYARDS AND STEEL CORPORATION v. MARTIN ARTOZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17349, April 23, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On November 22, 1957, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) issued an order in Case No. 1058-V directing petitioner National Shipyards and Steel Corporation (NASSCO) to pay overtime compensation to Jose Abiday and other employees [1, 2]. This order was affirmed by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-13888 on April 29, 1960 [3].

Subsequently, on March 7, 1960, respondents Martin Artoz, et al. filed a petition in the same CIR case (Case No. 1058-V), alleging they were in the same position as the original claimants (Abiday, et al.) and prayed that the benefits granted in the November 22, 1957 order be extended to them [3]. The CIR granted the petition [3]. NASSCO appealed, arguing that the CIR lacked jurisdiction over claims of those who were no longer employees at the time of filing, and that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations under Republic Act No. 1993 [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR has jurisdiction over the claims of respondents who are no longer employees of NASSCO.
2. W/N the claims are barred by the prescriptive period under Republic Act No. 1993.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the petition filed by Artoz, et al. was not a new or separate action but merely an incident of the execution of the CIR's final order dated November 22, 1957 [5]. Furthermore, the Supreme Court had already affirmed the CIR's jurisdiction over former employees in the main case involving Abiday, et al. (G.R. Nos. L-13732 and L-13888). This prior ruling constitutes the **law of the case** and bars NASSCO from raising the same jurisdictional issue for the third time in the same proceeding [6].

2. **NO.** Republic Act No. 1993, which amended the Eight-Hour Labor Law to include a prescriptive period, took effect on June 22, 1957, but contained a proviso that "actions already commenced" would not be affected [7, 8]. The original petition in the main case was filed on April 10, 1957, prior to the Act's effectivity [8]. Since the respondents' claim is a mere incident of that pending action, it is not subject to the prescriptive period set forth in the new law [5, 8].

The order and resolution appealed from are AFFIRMED [9].
