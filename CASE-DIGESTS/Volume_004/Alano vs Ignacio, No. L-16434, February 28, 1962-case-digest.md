I. CAPTION
CONSORCIA ALANO, ET AL. v. CARMEN IGNACIO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16434, February 28, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants, heirs of Victoriana Ignacio, filed an action for partition against defendants-appellees, heirs of Pedro Ignacio. Plaintiffs claimed that five parcels of land were inherited from their common ancestor, Manuel Ignacio, and that Pedro Ignacio (Manuel's son) merely administered the properties. Defendants denied the co-ownership, asserting that Pedro Ignacio and his successors possessed the lands exclusively, continuously, and adversely in the concept of owner since time immemorial [1, 2].

At trial, plaintiffs relied on testimonial evidence claiming their family worked the land before Pedro took over. However, plaintiff Genoveva admitted they demanded the property's return in 1912, which Pedro refused [3, 4]. Defendants presented tax declarations dating back to 1913, tax receipts, and a 1935 mortgage deed executed by Pedro acting as owner [5, 6]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissed the complaint for insufficient evidence [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to prove ownership and entitlement to partition.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that plaintiffs failed to prove the properties were inherited from Manuel Ignacio [9].

The Court held that the mere fact of working over a land without proof of the concept in which it is being worked (e.g., as owner or tenant) is no proof of ownership [10]. The testimony of a witness who was only seven years old at the time of the alleged possession is of no value, as she was in no position to categorically state the nature of such possession [10].

In contrast, the defendants established adverse and exclusive possession and ownership for 45 years. This was sufficiently attested to by tax declarations, payment of taxes, and a deed of mortgage executed by the predecessors-in-interest as owners [11].

The judgment of the lower court absolving the defendants is affirmed.
