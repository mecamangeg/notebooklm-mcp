I. CAPTION
CASIANO MAGISTRADO v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and SIMEON ENRILE TY-CANGCO, G.R. No. L-16558, January 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On April 9, 1952, petitioner Casiano Magistrado filed a complaint in the Municipal Court of Naga City against respondent Simeon Enrile Ty-Cangco for unpaid compensation as a log watchman at P50.00 a month from July 2, 1951, until relieved of his duties [1]. The Municipal Court rendered judgment in favor of Magistrado, ordering Ty-Cangco to pay the monthly compensation until relieved [1]. This judgment became final as Ty-Cangco did not appeal [2].

When the sheriff sought execution, Ty-Cangco filed a separate action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Sur to restrain the execution, arguing the decision was indefinite and the complaint was premature regarding future services [3]. The CFI issued an injunction [3]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) validated the award for services up to May 31, 1952, but declared the judgment void for the period starting June 1, 1952, reasoning that the cause of action for those future services had not yet accrued and was not in issue [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipal Court's judgment awarding compensation for services rendered after the decision ("until relieved") is valid and enforceable.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CA's finding on the validity of the judgment. The Municipal Court unquestionably had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter [6]. Whether or not Magistrado had a cause of action for services rendered subsequent to the decision was a question that did not affect the validity of the award; any error committed by the Municipal Court regarding the accrual of the cause of action was correctible by appeal, not by a separate action to enjoin execution [6], [2]. Since Ty-Cangco failed to appeal, the decision became final and executory [2].

Furthermore, the Court ruled that the compensation for future services was indeed in issue because Magistrado specifically prayed in his complaint to be paid "until he is relieved" [7], [8]. Thus, the Municipal Court did not exceed its jurisdiction in awarding such compensation.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is modified, and the writ of preliminary injunction is dissolved [9].
