I. CAPTION
AUGUSTO G. GAMBOA v. THE HON. JUDGE BIENVENIDO A. TAN and AGUSTIN A. CANCIO, G.R. No. L-17076, January 29, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In April 1960, petitioner Augusto G. Gamboa instituted consignation proceedings by depositing P16,450.00 with the Court of First Instance of Manila [1]. He requested that respondent Agustin A. Cancio be required to accept this sum as full settlement of his share in the enterprise "Gamboa's Manila, Inc." [1]. Cancio had previously refused the tender, claiming his share was worth at least P51,256.45 [2]. On May 6, 1960, before Cancio filed his answer or accepted the deposit, Gamboa moved to withdraw the sum [2]. The trial court granted the withdrawal on May 9, 1960 [2]. Subsequently, Cancio filed an answer expressing willingness to accept the deposit as *partial* payment and moved for reconsideration of the withdrawal order, claiming he was not notified [2, 3]. The lower court reversed itself and ordered Gamboa to redeposit the amount [3]. Gamboa filed this petition for certiorari [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the debtor may withdraw the sum deposited in consignation before the creditor accepts it or before a judicial declaration that the consignation has been properly made.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the debtor retains the right to withdraw the deposit prior to acceptance or judicial declaration. The Court applied **Article 1260 of the Civil Code**, which provides: "Before the creditor has accepted the consignation, or before a judicial declaration that the consignation has been properly made, the debtor may withdraw the thing or the sum deposited, allowing the obligation to remain in force" [3]. Since Gamboa withdrew the funds before Cancio expressed willingness to accept them (even as partial payment) and before the court declared the consignation proper, the trial court erred in ordering the redeposit [2, 3].

The order requiring the re-deposit of the money is **REVOKED** [5].
