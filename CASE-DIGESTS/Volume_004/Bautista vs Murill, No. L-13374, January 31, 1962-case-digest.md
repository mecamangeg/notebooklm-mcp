I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO BAUTISTA v. GERARDO MURILLO, G.R. No. L-13374, January 31, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Francisco Bautista, a dealer of gravel and sand, decided to demolish the building where he conducted his business (the ground floor of his residence) to construct a new one [1]. Respondent Gerardo Murillo, who was lodging in Bautista's house, volunteered to assist in the construction and was paid P3.00 a day for his services [2]. In March 1955, while Murillo was performing odd jobs, a stone wall collapsed, fracturing his left leg [2]. Murillo filed a claim with the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC). Bautista controverted the claim, arguing the construction was residential and Murillo was not an employee [3]. The Referee ruled that Murillo was an implied "casual" laborer entitled to compensation and ordered Bautista to pay P699.56 [4]. The WCC affirmed the decision *in toto* [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a casual laborer employed for the purposes of the employer's business is entitled to compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that Murillo is an employee entitled to compensation. Section 39(b) of the Workmen's Compensation Act defines a "laborer" or "employee" as excluding a person whose employment is "purely casual **and** is not for the purposes of the occupation or business of the employer" [6]. The Court held that for an employee to be excluded, the employment must be *both* casual and not for the business purpose of the employer [7]. While Murillo was a casual employee, his work was for the purpose of Bautista's business because the construction involved the place where the business was conducted [7, 8]. Furthermore, as social legislation, the Workmen's Compensation Act must be liberally construed to effectuate its beneficent provisions, resolving doubts in favor of labor [8, 9].

Decision affirmed [9].
