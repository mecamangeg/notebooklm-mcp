I. CAPTION
JOSE DE LUNA GONZALES and CATALINA M. GONZALES v. GENEROSA DE LEON, JUANITA MARTINEZ and the HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-17250, January 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On November 28, 1944, petitioner Jose de Luna Gonzales executed a deed of absolute sale of a parcel of land in Quezon to respondent Juanita Martinez for P30,000. On the same day, they entered into a contract granting Gonzales an option to repurchase the land for P6,000 within a specific period, while allowing him to occupy the property for a monthly rental. Martinez later assigned her rights to respondent Generosa de Leon in 1952.

Gonzales failed to pay the stipulated rentals. De Leon filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon for ejectment and recovery of rentals, and to be declared the owner of the property. Gonzales countered that the contracts did not express the true intent of the parties and were merely a device to circumvent the Usury Law.

The CFI ruled in favor of De Leon, rescinding the lease and declaring her the owner. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the decision but eliminated the award for damages. Gonzales appealed, arguing the lower courts erred in their factual findings regarding the contract's nature and the execution pending appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower courts erred in upholding the validity of the lease and sale contracts despite allegations of Usury Law circumvention.
2. W/N the petitioner may still exercise the right to repurchase the property under Article 1606 of the Civil Code.
3. W/N the order of execution pending appeal was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the deeds on their face established the existence of the contracts. The question of whether these deeds expressed the true intent of the parties is a question of fact. The affirmative findings of the CFI and the CA on this matter are conclusive upon the Supreme Court [1].

2. **YES.** Under Article 1606 of the Civil Code, the vendor may still exercise the right to repurchase within thirty (30) days from the time final judgment is rendered in a civil action on the basis that the contract was a true sale with right to repurchase. Citing *Ceynas v. Ulandez*, the Court held that Gonzales is entitled to redeem the property within 30 days from the finality of the decision [2].

3. **YES.** The Court found "good reasons" justified the execution pending appeal, specifically the uncontested fact that Gonzales had been unable to satisfy multiple other judgments and debts aggregating to substantial amounts [3, 4].

The decision of the Court of Appeals was **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**, declaring that Gonzales is entitled to redeem the property within thirty (30) days from the finality of the decision, provided that De Leon's credit for overdue rentals is first satisfied [4].
