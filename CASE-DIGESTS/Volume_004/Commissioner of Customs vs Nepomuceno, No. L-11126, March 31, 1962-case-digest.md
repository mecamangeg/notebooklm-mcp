**I. CAPTION**
**THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, petitioner, vs. FRUCTUOSO NEPOMUCENO, respondent**, G.R. No. L-11126, March 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Fructuoso Nepomuceno was the consignee of 183 packages of garlic shipped from Hong Kong which arrived in Manila in August 1954 [1]. The Collector of Customs seized the shipment and declared it forfeited for failure to present a release certificate from the Central Bank, as required by Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 [1, 2]. Since the goods were released under surety bonds, the Collector ordered Nepomuceno to pay over P60,000.00 [3].

The Commissioner of Customs affirmed the decision [4]. However, upon appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) reversed the Commissioner's ruling [5]. The CTA held that the Central Bank lacked the power to issue Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 to regulate "no-dollar" imports (imports allegedly not involving the sale of foreign exchange) [6]. The Commissioner filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 are valid and applicable to "no-dollar" imports, thereby justifying the seizure and forfeiture of the respondent's goods.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CTA and affirmed the Commissioner of Customs [7]. The Court held that Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 are valid measures taken by the Monetary Board under Section 74 of Republic Act No. 265 to protect the international reserve and check the unregulated flow of foreign exchange [8, 9].

The Court rejected the "no-dollar" import defense, ruling that even if an importation does not require immediate foreign exchange, it will ultimately involve a future demand for it to pay for the goods or remit earnings [10, 11]. Since the goods were imported without the necessary license (Circular No. 45) and release certificate (Circular No. 44), they are considered "merchandise of prohibited importation" subject to forfeiture under Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code [12, 13].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Dizon, and De Leon, JJ., concurred. Bengzon, C.J., took no part) [7].
