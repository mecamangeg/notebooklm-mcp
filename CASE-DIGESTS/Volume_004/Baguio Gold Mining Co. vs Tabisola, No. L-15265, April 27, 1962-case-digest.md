I. CAPTION
BAGUIO GOLD MINING COMPANY v. TABISOLA, et al., G.R. No. L-15265, April 27, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Tabisola and Monteclaro filed a complaint for unfair labor practice against petitioner Baguio Gold Mining Company, claiming they were discharged for union activities [1]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found the evidence insufficient to support the unfair labor practice charge and dismissed the complaint regarding the ULP [1]. However, the CIR ordered the reinstatement of the respondents with back wages, ruling that Tabisola was dismissed for no cause and that Monteclaro’s "unruly behavior" was not a sufficiently grave violation of office rules to warrant dismissal [1, 2]. Petitioner appealed, questioning the CIR's authority to order reinstatement after absolving the employer of the unfair labor practice charge [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has the authority to order reinstatement and award back wages after finding the employer not guilty of the unfair labor practice charged.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that under Section 5(c) of Republic Act 875, the CIR is expressly granted the power to order reinstatement and back wages only when it finds that the person charged has engaged in unfair labor practice [4]. This authority is implicitly withheld where the charge is not substantiated; in such cases, the CIR is directed to simply dismiss the complaint [4]. Unfair labor practice cases are distinctive proceedings prosecuted like criminal offenses, where the CIR is inhibited from exercising its broad powers of arbitration and conciliation found in Commonwealth Act No. 103 [5]. Any breach of obligation by the employer regarding the dismissal may be redressed like an ordinary contract or obligation in the proper courts, but not in the ULP proceeding [6].

The appealed decision is MODIFIED by the elimination of the order for reinstatement with back wages [6].
