I. CAPTION
OVERSEAS FACTORS, INC. and GERTRUDES CARLOS v. SOUTH SEA SHIPPING Co., LTD., A. MAGSAYSAY, INC., THE CAPTAIN AND CREW OF THE S.S. OCEAN TRADER and The COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-12138, February 27, 1962, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Overseas Factors, Inc. (Overseas) contracted to supply rice to the National Rice and Corn Corporation (NARIC). To transport the rice, Overseas chartered the *SS Ocean Trader* from respondent South Sea Shipping Co., Ltd. (South Sea). The charter party stipulated that freight was payable in British Pound Sterling in Hong Kong within 14 days of the vessel's departure from Karachi, Pakistan. A performance bond was executed by South Sea Surety & Insurance Co., Inc. to guarantee payment.

The vessel loaded rice in Karachi and arrived in Manila in December 1954. South Sea refused to unload the cargo, claiming the freight had not been fully paid. Overseas claimed they had paid the freight in Pakistani Rupees to South Sea's agent in Karachi. However, the agent held the funds pending government approval for remittance to Hong Kong, as required by the contract.

Overseas filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to compel the unloading and delivery of the rice. South Sea counterclaimed for unpaid freight, demurrage, and detention damages, asserting a lien on the cargo. The CFI ruled in favor of Overseas, holding that the freight was fully paid and that no lien existed because NARIC had already paid the purchase price (including freight) to Overseas. South Sea appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the freight was fully paid by Overseas Factors.
2. W/N South Sea Shipping has a maritime lien on the cargo for unpaid freight and demurrage.
3. W/N the surety, South Sea Surety & Insurance Co., remains liable under the performance bond.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the freight was not fully paid in accordance with the contract, which required payment in British Pound Sterling in Hong Kong. The Pakistani Rupees paid by Overseas' agent to South Sea's agent in Karachi were merely held "pending transfer" and subject to government approval; thus, they were not effectively received as payment under the charter terms [1]. However, to prevent unjust enrichment, the Court ordered that the amount paid in Rupees be set off against the total liability of Overseas to South Sea [2].

2. **YES.** Under **Article 665 of the Code of Commerce**, the carrier retains a lien on the cargo for unpaid freight. The Court rejected the lower court's view that NARIC's payment of the purchase price to Overseas extinguished the lien. Citing *National Rice and Corn Corporation vs. Macadaeg*, the Court ruled that the inclusion of freight in the purchase price paid by the buyer does not free the cargo from the carrier's lien if the freight has not actually been paid by the charterer to the carrier [3]. Furthermore, Clause 8 of the charter party expressly preserved the owner's lien for freight, deadfreight, and demurrage [3].

3. **NO.** The obligation of the surety was extinguished by **novation**. The parties amended the charter party in Hong Kong on November 12, 1954, regarding the rate and payment of freight (adding an option to pay in Philippine currency) without the consent of the surety [2]. This material change released the surety from the performance bond.

**Judgment modified.** Overseas Factors is ordered to pay South Sea Shipping the balance of the freight and demurrage (P203,449.57 plus demurrage charges), subject to a set-off of the amount already paid in Pakistani Rupees. The carrier's lien on the cargo is upheld. [4]
