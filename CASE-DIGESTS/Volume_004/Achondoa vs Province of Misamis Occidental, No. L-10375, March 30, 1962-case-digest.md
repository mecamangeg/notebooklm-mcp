I. CAPTION
LUIS ACHONDOA v. PROVINCE OF MISAMIS OCCIDENTAL, G.R. No. L-10375, March 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
In June 1945, after the liberation of Misamis Occidental, the Provincial Treasurer prevailed upon plaintiff Luis Achondoa to deposit P20,000.00 in emergency notes [1]. The Treasurer issued receipts marked "deposit for safekeeping" to be withdrawn in installments, but the funds were actually used to pay 50% of the salaries of provincial employees retained during the Japanese occupation [1, 2]. Achondoa filed a suit to recover the amount. The Province of Misamis Occidental argued that the Provincial Treasurer was not authorized to secure a loan from the plaintiff, making the act not binding on the province [3]. The Court of First Instance ruled that the transaction was *ultra vires* and dismissed the claim against the Province [4]. Achondoa appealed to the Supreme Court [3, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Province of Misamis Occidental is bound by the act of the Provincial Treasurer in securing the loan from the plaintiff.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that the Provincial Treasurer has no power to borrow money in the exercise of his functions. Under Section 2089 of the Revised Administrative Code, the Treasurer's duties are limited to the custody and disbursement of funds [6]. The power to borrow money for provincial expenses devolves upon the provincial government itself under Section 2086 of the same Code [6]. If funds are insufficient, the Treasurer must apprise the Provincial Board or suspend payments, but cannot borrow to cover the shortage [6, 7]. Consequently, the act of the Provincial Treasurer was *ultra vires* and does not bind the Province of Misamis Occidental [7]. The decision appealed from is affirmed [8].
