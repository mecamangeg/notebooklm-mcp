I. CAPTION
CITY OF LEGASPI v. THE HON. MATEO L. ALCASID, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-17936, January 30, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Lot 132 of the Albay cadastre and its improvements were owned by the Republic of the Philippines and occupied by the Bicol Regional School of Arts and Trades (BRSAT) and its predecessor since before World War II. In 1953, Proclamation No. 404 reserved the lot for the City of Legaspi for city hall purposes. However, the City was dissolved in 1954 and recreated in 1959. Relying on the 1953 Proclamation, the recreated City demanded the school vacate. When the superintendent refused, the City took possession of the premises on March 26, 1960, through force, stealth, violence, and strategy.

The City filed a complaint for illegal detainer against the school superintendent, Osmundo Dizon, in the Municipal Court, which dismissed the case. On appeal to the Court of First Instance (CFI), the Republic of the Philippines (represented by the Solicitor General) and Dizon filed a counterclaim seeking a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction to restore them in possession. The CFI granted the writ, ordering the City to vacate. The City filed a petition for certiorari alleging grave abuse of discretion, arguing the Republic was not a proper party and contesting the injunction.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Republic of the Philippines is a proper party to the case.
2. W/N the issuance of the preliminary mandatory injunction against the City of Legaspi was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Republic is the real party in interest because the lot and improvements belong to it, even though they were assigned to the Bureau of Public Schools. Although the superintendent was the named defendant, he was sued in his official capacity; thus, the party effectively sued is the Republic.

2. **YES.** The Court found the injunction justified under Article 539 of the New Civil Code, which states that "a possessor deprived of his possession through forcible entry may... present a motion to secure... a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction to restore him in his possession." The City admitted in its complaint that the school had prior physical possession. Furthermore, the record established that the City took possession by force and stealth in 1960. The Court also noted that Proclamation No. 404 became inoperative when the City was abolished in 1954; the City's recreation in 1959 did not automatically revive the reservation. Thus, the City had no right to forcibly take the property.

Petition is denied and the order appealed from is affirmed.
