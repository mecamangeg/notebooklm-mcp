I. CAPTION
SAULOG TRANSIT, INC. v. JOSE SAMALA, G.R. No. L-16232, March 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Jose Samala, an authorized operator of 12 TPU buses on the Cavite City-Manila route, applied with the Public Service Commission (PSC) for 12 additional units to operate specifically on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays [1]. Samala claimed that the influx of students, employees, and religious devotees on these days rendered existing units insufficient [2]. Petitioner Saulog Transit, Inc., another operator on the same line, opposed the application, arguing that the increased volume was not beyond the capacity of existing authorized units [1, 2].

The PSC assigned agents to check passenger volume for one week [3]. Based on the agents' report confirming higher traffic on the specified days, the PSC granted Samala authority to operate six (6) additional units [3, 4]. Saulog Transit petitioned for review, citing the dissent of Commissioner Aspillera, who pointed out that the very same report showed the buses were not fully loaded [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission erred in granting the respondent additional units based on the reported passenger volume.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the PSC decision. While the agents' report confirmed an increase in passenger volume on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, it also disclosed that "most of the buses being operated on the line in question were only half-full" [6].

The Court adopted the reasoning from Commissioner Aspillera's dissent, noting that the passengers were all accommodated in the buses operating on the days of checking, and with very few exceptions, the buses traveled on an average of "less than half load" [7, 8]. Since the evidence demonstrated that all passengers could be adequately accommodated by the presently authorized buses despite the volume increase, no additional units should be allowed [8, 9].

The decision appealed from is reversed and the petition of respondent Jose Samala is denied [10].
