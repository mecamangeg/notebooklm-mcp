I. CAPTION
THE PHILIPPINES INTERNATIONAL FAIR, INC. v. THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-12928 and L-12932, March 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Philippines International Fair, Inc. (PIF), a domestic corporation organized for profit with the government as a controlling stockholder, held the 1953 International Fair and the 1954 National Fair in Manila [1-3]. PIF charged admission fees for the exposition grounds, auditoriums, and specific attractions like the "Aquacade Show" and "Xavier Cugat Show" [2, 3]. The Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) demanded P178,475.59 representing amusement taxes, surcharges, and a compromise penalty [3]. PIF protested, claiming exemption based on government sponsorship, the cultural nature of the fair, verbal assurances from officials, and the "spirit" of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 722 [4].

The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled that PIF was liable for amusement tax on general admissions to the fairgrounds and auditorium but exempt regarding the "Aquacade Show," classifying it as a "water ballet" covered by R.A. No. 722 [5, 6]. The CTA also ruled it lacked jurisdiction to compel payment of the compromise penalty [7]. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N PIF is exempt from amusement tax on its general admission receipts.
2. W/N the "Aquacade Show" (water ballet) is exempt from amusement tax under R.A. No. 722.
3. W/N PIF can be compelled to pay the compromise penalty imposed by the CIR.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Tax exemptions are construed strictly against the grant and liberally in favor of the taxing power [9]. Although the government encouraged PIF and owned stock, PIF remained a private corporation organized for profit [10]. The fair included purely amusement features like side shows and dances, subjecting PIF to tax as an operator of an amusement place [9]. Verbal assurances by government officials cannot bind the State, as only the Legislature can grant tax exemptions [11].

2. **YES.** R.A. No. 722 exempts "operas, concerts, recitals, dramas, painting and art exhibitions" from amusement tax [12]. Citing *Collector of Internal Revenue v. Totoy Oteyza*, the Court held that ballet is an art *par excellence* and falls within the terms "concert," "opera," or "recital" [13]. Since the CTA found the "Aquacade" to be a water ballet, it is exempt [6].

3. **NO.** A compromise implies a mutual agreement between the parties [7]. The collection of a compromise penalty cannot be compelled in a tax assessment proceeding (as opposed to a criminal action) if the taxpayer does not consent to it [14, 15]. The Court cannot render judgment for a "compromise" which is effectively a penalty to avoid prosecution, absent the taxpayer's agreement [15].

Decision affirmed [16].
