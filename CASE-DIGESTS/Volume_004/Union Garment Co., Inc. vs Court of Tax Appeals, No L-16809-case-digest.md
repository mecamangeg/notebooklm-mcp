I. CAPTION
UNION GARMENT CO., INC. v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS and COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-16809, January 31, 1962, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
In 1953, petitioner Union Garment Co., Inc. entered into a contract with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to sew pants, drawers, shirts, and similar apparel [1]. Under the agreement, the AFP furnished the cloth materials, while the petitioner provided only the labor and services for sewing [1]. The Collector of Internal Revenue assessed the petitioner P4,114.38 for percentage tax, surcharge, and compromise penalty under Section 191 of the National Internal Revenue Code [2]. Petitioner paid under protest and sought a refund, arguing that its transactions were "purchases" made by the AFP and thus exempt under Republic Act No. 816 [3]. The Court of Tax Appeals dismissed the petition, ruling that the transactions were not purchases but contracts for a piece of work or lease of services [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner’s contract for sewing garments using materials furnished by the AFP is exempt from percentage tax as a "purchase" under Republic Act No. 816.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the lower court's decision, reiterating the principle that tax exemptions must be strictly construed against the party claiming them [5]. Since the AFP provided the materials, the petitioner invested only its labor and "sold nothing but the services rendered by it" [5]. The Court held that services are not materials; thus, the transaction was not a purchase of goods but a lease of services [5]. Consequently, the petitioner is subject to the percentage tax imposed on tailor shops and contractors under **Section 191 of the National Internal Revenue Code** [5, 6].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **AFFIRMED** [6].
