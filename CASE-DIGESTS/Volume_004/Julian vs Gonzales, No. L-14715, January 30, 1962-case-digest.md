**I. CAPTION**
MARCELA JULIAN, ET AL. v. M. GONZALES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14715, January 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiffs Marcela and Melitona Julian claimed to be co-heirs of their grandmother, Maria Gregorio, original owner of Lot No. 954 in Bulacan. The defendants, children of the deceased, executed an extra-judicial partition excluding the plaintiffs and subsequently sold shares of the property to third parties.

On August 24, 1950, plaintiffs filed Civil Case No. 482 for partition and recovery of shares. On July 25, 1951, the trial court dismissed the case for failure to prosecute, noting that plaintiffs took no action on their amended complaint for several months. The dismissal order did not state whether it was with or without prejudice.

In 1954, plaintiffs filed Civil Case No. 845 regarding the same property, which was dismissed on the ground that the action was barred by the previous dismissal. Finally, on July 16, 1955, plaintiffs filed the present action (Civil Case No. 1121) to void the transactions involving the lot and declare their ownership. The Court of First Instance of Bulacan dismissed the complaint on the ground of *res judicata*. Plaintiffs appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the dismissal of the previous civil case for failure to prosecute constitutes *res judicata* barring the present action.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. Under Rule 30, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, a dismissal based on the plaintiff's failure to prosecute has the effect of an adjudication upon the merits, unless the court expressly provides otherwise. The order dismissing Civil Case No. 482 contained no such provision. Since the order was issued by a competent court, had become executory, and there was complete identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action between the previous cases and the present one, the claim is barred by the prior judgment.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None.
