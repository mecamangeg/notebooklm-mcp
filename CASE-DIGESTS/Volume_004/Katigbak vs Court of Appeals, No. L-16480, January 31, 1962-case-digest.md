I. CAPTION
ARTEMIO KATIGBAK v. COURT OF APPEALS, DANIEL EVANGELISTA and V. K. LUNDBERG, G.R. No. L-16480, January 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Artemio Katigbak agreed to purchase a Double Drum Carco Tractor Winch from Daniel Evangelista for P12,000.00 [1]. The terms required a payment of P5,000.00 upon delivery and the balance of P7,000.00 within 60 days [1]. Since the winch needed repairs, Katigbak advanced P2,029.85 for spare parts, which was stipulated to be deductible from the initial payment [2]. However, Katigbak failed to take delivery and refused to comply with the contract [3, 4]. Consequently, Evangelista sold the winch to a third party for P10,000.00, incurring a loss of P2,000.00 [3]. Katigbak sued Evangelista and his agent, V.K. Lundberg, for the refund of the amount advanced [2].

The trial court ordered the defendants to refund the P2,029.85 [5]. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed, ruling that while Katigbak was entitled to the refund, Evangelista was entitled to offset the P2,000.00 loss resulting from the breach (the difference between the contract price and resale price) [5]. Thus, the CA awarded Katigbak only the balance of P29.85 and ordered him to pay attorney's fees [6]. Katigbak appealed, arguing the CA erred in applying the doctrine of *Hanlon v. Hausserman* and failing to apply the law on rescission [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a vendor may resell the goods and recover the price difference from a defaulting buyer without a judicial action for rescission.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA, applying the doctrine in *Hanlon v. Hausserman* (40 Phil. 796). The Court held that in a contract of sale which is executory as to both parties, the vendor is entitled to resell the goods if the purchaser fails to take delivery and pay the purchase price [7]. If the vendor is obliged to sell for less than the contract price, he holds the buyer for the difference; if he sells for as much or more, the breach is *damnum absque injuria* [4].

The Court emphasized that "it has never been held that there is any need of an action of rescission to authorize the vendor, who is still in possession, to dispose of the property where the buyer fails to pay the price and take delivery" [4]. Since the breach was attributable to Katigbak, Evangelista had the undisputed right to resell the equipment and recover the P2,000.00 difference between the agreed price (P12,000.00) and the resale price (P10,000.00) [4].

The petition was **DISMISSED**, and the decision appealed from was **AFFIRMED** [8].
