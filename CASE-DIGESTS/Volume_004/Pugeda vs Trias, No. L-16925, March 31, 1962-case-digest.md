I. CAPTION
**FABIAN PUGEDA v. RAFAEL TRIAS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16925, March 31, 1962, Labrador, J.**

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Fabian Pugeda claims he married Maria C. Ferrer on January 5, 1916, and they lived together until her death in 1934. The defendants are the children of Maria C. Ferrer with her first husband, Mariano Trias (deceased), and her children with Pugeda. The dispute involves "Friar Lands" in Cavite acquired under the Friar Lands Act (Act No. 1120). Certificates of sale for these lots were issued to Mariano Trias in 1910. After Mariano’s death, the certificates were assigned to his widow, Maria, in 1916. Installments on the purchase price were paid during the marriage of Pugeda and Maria.

Pugeda filed a complaint in 1948 for partition, claiming the lands were conjugal property of his marriage with Maria because installments were paid during their union. The defendants denied the existence of Pugeda’s marriage to Maria due to the absence of a marriage contract in the civil registry and argued the properties belonged to the estate of Mariano and Maria.

The Court of First Instance (Judge Lucero) initially ruled the marriage valid but declared the lands conjugal property of the first marriage (Mariano and Maria), awarding Pugeda only a usufructuary share. Upon remand from the Court of Appeals for new evidence, a different judge (Judge Gonzales) ruled the lands were conjugal property of Pugeda and Maria based on the installment payments. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Fabian Pugeda and Maria C. Ferrer were validly married despite the absence of a record in the civil registry.
2. W/N the friar lands acquired under Act No. 1120 are conjugal property of the second marriage (Pugeda and Ferrer) because installments were paid during said marriage.
3. W/N Pugeda’s claim to the estate and improvements is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The marriage existed. When the question of marriage arises in litigation, it may be proved by evidence of any kind, not just the civil registry record. The Court relied on the testimony of witnesses to the ceremony, the public cohabitation of the parties as husband and wife for 18 years, the birth certificates of their children, and admissions in the "Project of Partition" signed by the defendants. The mere fact that the solemnizing officer failed to send a copy of the marriage certificate to the registry does not invalidate the marriage if all requisites were present [1-4].

2. **NO.** The lands are conjugal properties of the *first* marriage (Mariano Trias and Maria C. Ferrer). Under the Friar Lands Act (Act No. 1120), the certificate of sale conveys ownership to the purchaser subject only to the resolutory condition of non-payment. The beneficial and equitable title vests in the purchaser upon the issuance of the certificate [5-7]. Since the certificates were issued to Mariano Trias, he is considered the owner. The fact that installments were paid during the second marriage does not transfer ownership, especially since the payments were made from the fruits of the lands themselves [8]. Furthermore, the acquisition of Friar Lands is not governed by the Public Land Act; rights descend to the heirs if the holder dies [5, 9].

3. **YES.** Pugeda’s claims are barred. He failed to intervene in the intestate proceedings of Mariano Trias (1915–1929), where the lands were adjudicated to Mariano’s heirs and Maria. Additionally, in 1935, a project of partition for Maria’s estate was shown to Pugeda, which omitted him entirely. He took no action until filing this suit in 1948, over 13 years later. His inaction for such a long period bars him from asserting any claim, usufructuary or otherwise, to the properties or improvements [10-14].

**Disposition:** The complaint is **DISMISSED**. The judgment of the trial court (Judge Lucero) is **MODIFIED**; the properties of Maria C. Ferrer are to be divided equally among her eight children (1/8 each), eliminating the usufructuary share previously awarded to the plaintiff [15].
