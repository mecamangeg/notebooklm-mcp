I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MAMBULAO LUMBER COMPANY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17725, February 28, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Mambulao Lumber Company (Mambulao) admitted a liability of P4,802.37 to the Republic of the Philippines for forest charges covering the period from 1952 to 1954 [1, 2]. However, Mambulao contended that it had paid the government P9,127.50 in "reforestation charges" from 1947 to 1956 pursuant to Republic Act No. 115 [3]. Mambulao argued that because the government had not used these funds to reforest the specific area covered by Mambulao's license, the amount should be refunded or applied as compensation (set-off) against the forest charges it owed [3, 4].

The Court of First Instance of Manila rejected this defense and ordered Mambulao to pay the P4,802.37 with interest [1]. Mambulao appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved questions of law only [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N reforestation charges paid by a licensee can be compensated (set-off) against forest charges due to the government.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that the amounts cannot be compensated [5].

First, under Section 1 of R.A. No. 115, reforestation charges constitute a "Reforestation Fund" to be expended by the Director of Forestry for the reforestation of denuded areas found to be in need of attention, not necessarily the specific area covered by the payer's license [6-8]. The Court held that this payment is in the nature of a tax which forms part of the fund, payable irrespective of whether the licensee's specific area is reforested [8]. There is no provision in the law requiring a refund if the specific area is not reforested [8].

Second, regarding the claim of compensation, the Court applied Article 1278 of the Civil Code, which requires that for compensation to take place, two persons must be creditors and debtors of each other in their own right [9, 10]. The Court held that internal revenue taxes, such as forest charges, cannot be the subject of set-off or compensation [11, 12]. Taxes are not in the nature of contracts but grow out of a duty to the government; thus, the government and the taxpayer are not mutually creditors and debtors [9, 12]. Allowing such set-offs would violate public policy and disrupt government finances [12].

The judgment of the trial court was affirmed [5].
