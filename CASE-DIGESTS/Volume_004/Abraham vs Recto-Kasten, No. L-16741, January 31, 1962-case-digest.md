I. CAPTION
FLORENCIA Q. DE ABRAHAM, ALFONSO ABRAHAM, and JESUS ABRAHAM v. INTESTATE ESTATE OF JUAN C. YSMAEL, PRISCILLA RECTO-KASTEN, G.R. No. L-16741, January 31, 1962, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
On September 3, 1943, Juan C. Ysmael obtained a loan of P12,500.00 in Japanese currency notes from Alfonso Abraham, Sr. Ysmael executed a promissory note promising to pay within 90 days with 10% interest per annum. The note was witnessed by the creditor’s wife, Florencia Q. Abraham. Ysmael died without paying the debt.

In the intestate proceedings for Ysmael's estate, the petitioners filed a claim for the amount on November 13, 1954. During the trial, Florencia Abraham testified regarding the execution of the note. The counsel for the administratrix (respondent Recto-Kasten) extensively cross-examined her on the circumstances of the note's execution. The Court of First Instance allowed the claim, ruling it was valid and finding that the administratrix waived the prohibition against witnesses testifying on matters occurring before the death of the deceased (Dead Man's Statute) by cross-examining the witness on those very matters.

The Court of Appeals reversed the lower court, ruling that while the claim might be valid, it was barred by prescription, estoppel, and laches. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the prohibition against testifying on matters of fact occurring before the death of the deceased (Dead Man's Statute) was waived.
2. W/N the claim is barred by prescription.
3. W/N the claim is barred by laches.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that there was a waiver of the prohibition contained in Section 26(c), Rule 123 of the Rules of Court (Dead Man's Statute). This waiver occurred when the counsel for the administratrix extensively cross-examined the witness (Florencia) on the very matters subject of the prohibition. A litigant cannot be permitted to speculate on what an examination of a witness may produce and then change their position if the result is disadvantageous. Having chosen to cross-examine, the respondent waived the protection of the rule [1].

2. **NO.** While the cause of action accrued on December 3, 1943, and the claim was filed only on November 13, 1954 (a lapse of nearly 12 years), the Debt Moratorium Law suspended the statute of limitations. The moratorium was effective from Executive Order No. 25 (November 18, 1944) until the decision in *Rutter v. Esteban* (May 18, 1953). Deducting this suspension period of roughly 8 years and 6 months from the total elapsed time, the claim was filed well within the 10-year prescriptive period for written contracts under Article 1144 of the New Civil Code [2]. The Court further noted that Republic Act No. 342 did not lift the moratorium for debts contracted during the war (Japanese occupation), but only for pre-war debts [3].

3. **NO.** For laches to exist, there must be: (1) conduct giving rise to the situation; (2) delay in asserting rights; (3) lack of notice to the defendant; and (4) injury or prejudice to the defendant. The Court ruled that the fourth element was missing. Mere lapse of time is not the sole basis for laches; there must be a change of conditions detrimental to the defendant. Since no such change or prejudice was shown, the defense of laches cannot prosper [4].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED**, and the Order-Decree of the Court of First Instance is **AFFIRMED** [5].
