I. CAPTION
C. N. HODGES v. ELPIDIO JAVELLANA and the HON. COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-17247, April 28, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner C.N. Hodges filed a complaint against respondent Elpidio Javellana to recover sums of money based on three causes of action: a promissory note and two sales of machinery/equipment, all guaranteed by mortgages. The contracts stipulated interest at 1% per month and contained a clause that unpaid interest would be added to the capital and bear like interest (compounding). The mortgaged properties were destroyed during the Japanese occupation (1942-1943). The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Hodges in accordance with the contracts. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) modified the decision, ordering Javellana to pay the principal amounts but allowing interest only from the filing of the complaint. The CA reasoned that because the properties were destroyed by war and Hodges had fled the country, making payment impossible, it was "revolting to the conscience" to allow recovery of interest accrued prior to the suit. Hodges appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the valid contractual stipulations on interest should be enforced.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the creditor is entitled to recover the stipulated interest accrued during the Japanese occupation and prior to the filing of the complaint.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals.

Regarding interest accrued during the war, the Court applied the doctrine in *Warner Barnes & Co., Ltd. v. Yasay*, holding that it is equitable to eliminate interest during the war years when the debtor could not pay an enemy alien creditor and was not in bad faith [1, 2].

Regarding the regular and compounded interest after liberation, the Court held that the provision on compounding interest partakes of the nature of a **penal clause**. Under **Article 1229 of the Civil Code** (and Article 1154 of the Spanish Civil Code), courts have the power to equitably reduce a penalty if the principal obligation has been partly or irregularly performed or if the penalty is iniquitous or unconscionable [3, 4]. The Court found the mitigation of interest justified under these circumstances.

**Petition DENIED. Decision affirmed.** [5]
