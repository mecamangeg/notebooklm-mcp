I. CAPTION
ONG SEE HANG, ETC., ET AL. v. HON. COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION and RICARDO PORTUGAL, G.R. No. L-9700, February 28, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, Chinese nationals, arrived in Manila on November 3, 1952, on board the S.S. Cleveland. They were allowed by Philippine immigration authorities to disembark for the purpose of transferring to another transport for Hongkong, with a deadline to leave by November 28, 1952 [1, 2]. Petitioners failed to depart within the prescribed period [2]. Consequently, immigration authorities issued warrants for their arrest and, after investigation, the Board of Commissioners of Immigration ordered their deportation for violating the conditions of their temporary stay [3].

Petitioners requested the Bureau of Immigration to release them on bail pending deportation, but the request was denied [4]. They subsequently filed a petition for habeas corpus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [5, 6]. The CFI denied the writ of habeas corpus but, finding that the respondents committed grave abuse of discretion in denying bail, ordered the release of the petitioners upon the filing of a bond [5, 7]. The Commissioner of Immigration appealed the portion of the decision granting bail [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has the authority to grant bail to aliens in deportation proceedings after the Commissioner of Immigration has denied the same.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. Section 37(9)(e) of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940 confers upon the Commissioner of Immigration the power and discretion to grant bail in deportation proceedings to the exclusion of the courts [7, 8]. The law uses the word "may," indicating that the grant of bail is merely permissive and discretionary on the part of the Commissioner, not mandatory [8].

The Court held that aliens in deportation proceedings have no inherent right to bail, and the right to bail guaranteed by the Constitution cannot be invoked because deportation is not a criminal action and an order of deportation is not a punishment for a crime [7, 9]. Furthermore, the Commissioner's power to grant bail is intended to be exercised while the alien is under investigation, not after the order of deportation has already been issued [10].

The Court distinguished this case from *Mejoff* and *Borovsky*, where indefinite detention of stateless aliens was deemed unwarranted. Here, petitioners are not stateless, have a known country to return to (Formosa/China), and their continued detention was due to circumstances of their own making by defying immigration laws [11, 12].

The decision appealed from is REVERSED and SET ASIDE insofar as it orders petitioners' release pending their actual deportation [13].
