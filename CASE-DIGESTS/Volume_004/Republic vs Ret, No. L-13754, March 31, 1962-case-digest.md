I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DAMIAN P. RET, G.R. No. L-13754, March 31, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Damian P. Ret filed a fraudulent income tax return for 1948 and failed to file a return for 1949. On January 20, 1951, the Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) issued an assessment for deficiency income taxes against Ret. Ret was subsequently prosecuted and convicted for violation of the Tax Code. On September 5, 1957, more than five years after the assessment, the Republic filed a civil complaint to recover the deficiency taxes. Ret filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground of prescription. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, ruling that the five-year period to collect by judicial action had expired. The Republic appealed, arguing that the period was ten years due to fraud, or that the criminal case suspended the prescriptive period.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the government's right to collect the deficiency income taxes by judicial action has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the action was barred by the statute of limitations.

The Court ruled that while Title II of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) governs income tax, it lacks specific provisions for the prescriptive period of collection by *judicial action* (Section 51(d) applies only to summary methods). Therefore, Section 332(c) of the NIRC applies suppletorily. Under Section 332(a), in cases of fraud or failure to file a return, the CIR has ten years to either assess the tax or file a proceeding in court *without assessment*. However, once the CIR chooses to issue an assessment, as was done in this case on January 20, 1951, the period becomes governed by Section 332(c), which limits the filing of a proceeding in court to five years from the date of assessment.

Furthermore, the Court rejected the argument that the criminal prosecution suspended the prescriptive period. A civil action for tax collection is distinct from the civil liability arising from the offense; thus, the Collector was not "prohibited" from filing the civil suit during the pendency of the criminal case under Section 333. Since the complaint was filed in 1957, more than five years after the 1951 assessment, the action had prescribed.

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
