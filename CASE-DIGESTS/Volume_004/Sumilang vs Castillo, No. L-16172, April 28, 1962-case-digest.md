**I. CAPTION**
ARSENIO SUMILANG v. GUALBERTO CASTILLO, ARSENIO G. CASTRO, N. BAENS DEL ROSARIO, JOSE SANCHEZ and CESAREO DE LEON, G.R. No. L-16172, April 28, 1962, Padilla, J.

**II. FACTS**
On September 6, 1955, respondent Gualberto Castillo, a driver for petitioner Arsenio Sumilang, was injured in a vehicular accident [1]. Castillo filed a claim for compensation against Sumilang with the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) [2]. The WCC awarded Castillo P2,406.29 and subsequently issued a writ of execution [3]. Sumilang filed a complaint with the WCC to annul the award, which was dismissed [3, 4]. Subsequently, the sheriff sold Sumilang's land at a public auction [4].

Sumilang then filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Tarlac praying for the annulment of the WCC award and the writ of execution, and to enjoin the final sale of his land [4]. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the CFI lacked jurisdiction [5, 6]. The CFI dismissed the complaint, prompting Sumilang to appeal to the Supreme Court [7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to annul or set aside an award or writ of execution issued by the Workmen's Compensation Commission.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court of First Instance is not clothed with jurisdiction to review, modify, much less annul an award or order of execution issued by the Workmen's Compensation Commission [8].

Under Section 46 of Republic Act No. 772, the Workmen's Compensation Commission has exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide claims for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act [9]. The law provides that decisions, orders, or awards entered by the Commission are appealable to the Supreme Court [8]. Furthermore, under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, WCC members have the qualifications of CFI Judges, reinforcing that the CFI is not a superior court empowered to review WCC decisions [8].

The order of the Court of First Instance dismissing the complaint is affirmed [10].
