**I. CAPTION**
HON. ARSENIO H. LACSON, as Mayor of Manila and CONRADO AQUINO v. SANTOS VILLAFRANCA, HON. RAMON YCASIANO, as Executive Judge, Municipal Court, Manila, and HON. ALEJO MABANAG, as Secretary of Justice, G.R. No. L-17398, January 30, 1962, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
In March 1958, the Secretary of Justice appointed respondent Santos Villafranca as Deputy Clerk of the Municipal Court of Manila upon the recommendation of the Executive Judge. On January 27, 1959, petitioner Mayor Arsenio Lacson of Manila appointed petitioner Conrado Aquino to the same position with the consent of the Municipal Board. Executive Judge Ycasiano refused to accept Aquino as the position was already occupied. Lacson and Aquino filed a petition for *quo warranto* and *mandamus* to oust Villafranca, arguing that the power to appoint the Deputy Clerk is vested in the Mayor under the City Charter. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of petitioners, declaring Aquino entitled to the office. Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the power to appoint the Deputy Clerk of the Municipal Court of Manila is vested in the Mayor of Manila.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Deputy Clerk of the Municipal Court of Manila is not an officer or employee of the City of Manila. Section 20 of Republic Act No. 409 (Revised Charter of the City of Manila) enumerates the "city departments," and the Municipal Court is not included in this list. The Court emphasized that the administration of justice is a matter of national, not local, concern.

Under Section 83 of the Revised Administrative Code, executive supervision over inferior courts, including municipal courts, is vested in the Department of Justice. Furthermore, Section 79(D) of the Revised Administrative Code provides that the Department Head shall appoint all subordinate officers and employees whose appointment is not expressly vested by law in the President. Since the Municipal Court is under the supervision of the Department of Justice, the Deputy Clerk is an appointee of the Secretary of Justice, not the City Mayor.

The decision appealed from is reversed and the case is dismissed.
