I. CAPTION
ENCARNACION BACANI and VIRGILIO BACANI v. FELICISIMA PAZ SAMIA GALAURAN, LEONIDES B. SAMIA, ANGELINA SAMIA MACIAS and ANASTACIA DIZON, G.R. No. L-16066, April 25, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Manuel Bacani died intestate in 1931, leaving no legitimate descendants but survived by his two acknowledged natural children, plaintiffs Encarnacion and Virgilio Bacani [1, 2]. In 1938, the defendants (Manuel's nieces/nephews and the administratrix of his sister Josefa’s estate) executed a deed of extrajudicial partition adjudicating Manuel’s properties to themselves. This partition was approved by the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pampanga in Special Proceeding No. 5695, which concerned the **Testate Estate of Josefa Bacani** [2]. Consequently, Manuel's original title was cancelled and a new one issued to the defendants [2].

Plaintiffs subsequently filed an action to establish title to the properties. The trial court ruled in favor of plaintiffs, declaring them the sole heirs and owners, and voiding the extrajudicial partition [3]. Defendants appealed, arguing that the action was barred by *res judicata* (due to the CFI order approving the partition), prescription, and lack of jurisdiction because there was no prior judicial declaration of nullity of the partition [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action is barred by *res judicata* due to the order approving the extrajudicial partition in the estate proceedings of Josefa Bacani.
2. W/N the action is barred by prescription.
3. W/N the trial court had jurisdiction over the subject matter despite the absence of a previous separate judicial declaration of nullity of the partition.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The order of the CFI Pampanga in Special Proceeding No. 5695 approving the extrajudicial partition cannot bar the present action under the principle of *res judicata*. That order was issued in the proceedings for the settlement of the estate of **Josefa Bacani**, wherein the court had no jurisdiction to determine who were the heirs of **Manuel Bacani** or who should inherit his estate [5]. Furthermore, the Court of Appeals had already rejected this *res judicata* claim in a prior related case involving the same parties [5].

2. **NO.** The plaintiffs’ right to assail the partition is not barred by the statute of limitations because they have contested it since 1939 [6]. Moreover, the order approving the partition was null and void *ab initio* for want of jurisdiction, making it "as good as non-existent" regarding the transmission of title to Manuel’s properties [6].

3. **YES.** (The court properly exercised jurisdiction). The absence of a previous judicial declaration of nullity of the deed of extrajudicial partition does not affect the court's jurisdiction over the subject matter, which is conferred by law [7]. It is sufficient that the allegations showing nullity were made in the complaint, allowing the court to make the corresponding declaration of nullity in the decision itself [7].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
