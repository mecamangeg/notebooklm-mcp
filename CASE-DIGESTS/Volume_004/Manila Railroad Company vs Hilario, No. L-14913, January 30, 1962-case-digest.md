I. CAPTION
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and ANDRES GARCIA v. HON. ZOILO HILARIO, PASTOR PANO, FORTUNATO PANO, MAXIMO PANO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14913, January 30, 1962, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Manila Railroad Company and its train driver, Andres Garcia, were sued for damages in the Court of First Instance of Tarlac regarding a collision between their train and a truck, which resulted in the death of Emilia de la Cruz. The petitioners (defendants) moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of improper venue. They argued that the complaint alleged the plaintiffs resided in Nueva Ecija and the defendants in Manila. However, the complaint also affirmatively alleged that one of the plaintiffs, Fortunato Pano, was a resident of Paniqui, Tarlac. To contest this, petitioners submitted certificates from the Chief of Police and Mayor of Paniqui stating Fortunato was not a resident of that town. Judge Hilario denied the motion to dismiss. Petitioners then filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the motion to dismiss for improper venue based on the plaintiffs' residence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, ruling that the issue is one of venue, not jurisdiction [1]. Under the Rules of Court (Rule 5, Sec. 1), venue is proper where the plaintiff or any of the principal plaintiffs resides [2]. Since the complaint contained an affirmative allegation that one of the plaintiffs was a resident of Tarlac, the trial court could not be prohibited from taking cognizance of the litigation [2]. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion by accepting this allegation *prima facie* to deny the motion to dismiss [1]. The Court held that the certificates regarding non-residence presented by the petitioners were not conclusive at that stage and should instead be exhibited as evidence during the trial [1, 2].

The petition is dismissed [3].
