I. CAPTION
COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. ALBERTO D. BENIPAYO, G.R. No. L-13656, February 26, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
The Solicitor General filed a motion for reconsideration requesting the elimination of the portion of the Supreme Court's decision promulgated on January 31, 1962, which sentenced the petitioner, the Collector of Internal Revenue, to pay the costs of the suit [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Collector of Internal Revenue should be sentenced to pay costs.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court granted the motion to eliminate the award of costs. The Court reasoned that the petitioner should not be liable for costs because the tax assessment, which was the subject matter of the action, was not made arbitrarily [1]. In making this ruling, the Court relied on the jurisprudence established in *Collector vs. Prieto* (G.R. No. L-11976) and *Collector vs. Convention of the Phil. Baptist Churches* (G.R. No. L-11807) [1]. The motion was granted [1].
