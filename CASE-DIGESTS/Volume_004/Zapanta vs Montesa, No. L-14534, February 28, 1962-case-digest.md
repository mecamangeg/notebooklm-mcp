I. CAPTION
MERARDO L. ZAPANTA v. THE HON. AGUSTIN P. MONTESA, Provincial Fiscal of Bulacan, and OLIMPIA A. YCO, G.R. No. L-14534, February 28, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On May 20, 1958, respondent Olimpia A. Yco filed a complaint for Bigamy against petitioner Merardo L. Zapanta in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan (Criminal Case No. 3405). The information alleged that Zapanta contracted a second marriage with Yco while his previous marriage to Estrella Guarin was still subsisting [1].

On June 16, 1958, Zapanta filed a civil action in the CFI of Pampanga (Civil Case No. 1446) against Yco seeking the annulment of their marriage on the ground of duress, force, and intimidation [2]. Yco moved to dismiss the civil complaint, but the motion was denied [2].

On September 2, 1958, Zapanta filed a motion in the criminal case to suspend proceedings, arguing that the pending civil case for annulment constituted a prejudicial question [2]. Respondent Judge Montesa denied the motion and the subsequent reconsideration, ordering Zapanta's arraignment [2]. Zapanta filed a petition for prohibition with the Supreme Court to enjoin the criminal trial [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the civil action for annulment of the second marriage constitutes a prejudicial question that warrants the suspension of the criminal case for bigamy.

IV. RULING
**YES.** A prejudicial question is defined as one that arises in a case, the resolution of which is a logical antecedent of the issue involved therein, and the cognizance of which pertains to another tribunal [4, 5].

The Court, citing *People v. Aragon* (G.R. No. L-5930), held that the prejudicial question must be determinative of the case before the court, and jurisdiction to try the same must be lodged in another court [5]. In this case, should the annulment of the second marriage prosper on the ground of duress, force, and intimidation, it would establish that Zapanta's act was involuntary, preventing a conviction for bigamy [5, 6]. Thus, the validity of the second marriage is determinative of the petitioner's guilt or innocence [6].

Since the jurisdiction to decide the validity of the marriage lies with the civil court (CFI Pampanga), the civil action must be decided before the criminal prosecution can proceed [6, 7]. The Court applied the rule in *Aragon*, extending it to cases where the accused claims the *second* marriage is voidable due to duress [7].

Petition granted.
