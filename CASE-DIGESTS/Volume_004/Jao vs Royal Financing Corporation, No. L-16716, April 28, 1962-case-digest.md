I. CAPTION
PEDRO R. JAO and CATALINA SIA v. ROYAL FINANCING CORPORATION, ET AL. (ASSOCIATED INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., bondsman-appellant), G.R. No. L-16716, April 28, 1962, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Pedro Jao and Catalina Sia filed an action against Royal Financing Corporation and obtained a writ of preliminary injunction upon posting a bond of P2,500.00 issued by Associated Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. The bond was conditioned to pay for damages the defendants might sustain by reason of the injunction if the court finally decided the plaintiffs were not entitled thereto [1]. The trial court subsequently dismissed the case on June 11, 1959, due to the plaintiffs' failure to appear at the hearing [2]. This dismissal became final.

On September 7, 1959, after the judgment had become final, Royal Financing Corporation filed a motion for judgment on the bond [3]. The trial court ordered the execution of the bond to satisfy the defendant's "mortgage claim" [4], [5]. The surety company appealed, arguing that the bond was for injunction damages, not the mortgage credit, and that the claim was time-barred [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the preliminary injunction bond may be executed to satisfy the defendant’s mortgage claim.
2. W/N the surety is liable for damages when the application was filed after the judgment became final.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The bond was solely and expressly issued to secure the prayer for preliminary injunction and to compensate the defendant for damages sustained *by reason of the injunction* [6]. It was not intended to secure the mortgage credit [7]. Under Article 2055 of the Civil Code, a guaranty cannot extend to more than what is expressly stipulated therein; it cannot be extended by implication beyond its specified limits [7].

2. **NO.** Requisites for claiming damages against a surety bond under Section 9, Rule 60 and Section 20, Rule 59 of the Rules of Court mandate that the application for damages must be filed **before** the entry of final judgment [3]. In this case, the dismissal had already become final and executory before the defendant filed its motion [3]. Consequently, the surety is relieved of liability. Furthermore, a claim for damages must be substantiated by competent evidence in a proper hearing, which the trial court failed to conduct [8].

The orders of the trial court are **REVERSED**, and the bondsman-appellant is relieved of further responsibility [9].
