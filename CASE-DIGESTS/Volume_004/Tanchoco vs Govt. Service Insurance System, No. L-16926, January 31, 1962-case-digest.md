I. CAPTION
FELIPE TANCHOCO v. GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-16926, January 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Felipe Tanchoco, a cashier for the Manila Railroad Company (MRR), retired after 39 years of service. The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) approved his retirement and prepared a warrant for P868.65 as partial gratuity [1]. However, GSIS withheld payment at the instance of MRR, which claimed Tanchoco was liable for P10,936.20 lost due to forged checks he had encashed [1]. Tanchoco had encashed the checks upon identification by his superior, who was the one criminally charged; Tanchoco himself was cleared of accountability by MRR's accounting department upon retirement [2]. Tanchoco sued GSIS in the Municipal Court. MRR intervened [3]. The Court of First Instance initially dismissed the complaint but, on reconsideration, ordered GSIS to pay Tanchoco [3]. MRR appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Tanchoco's retirement gratuity may be withheld to satisfy the loss incurred by the Manila Railroad Company due to the forged checks.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the gratuity cannot be withheld. MRR's reliance on Sections 636 and 637 of the Revised Administrative Code (RAC) is misplaced [4]. Section 636 refers to "government property," not funds, while Section 637 applies to "officers accountable for government funds" [5]. Although government-owned, MRR is a private corporation with a personality separate and distinct from the government; its funds are private, and Tanchoco was not a government officer [5]. Furthermore, the loss was not due to Tanchoco's negligence or misappropriation [2]. Sections 624 and 650 of the RAC do not authorize such withholding because MRR is not the "Government of the Philippines" [6].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
