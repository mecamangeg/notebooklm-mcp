I. CAPTION
BENJAMIN P. PALOMIQUE v. HON. PERFECTO R. PALACIO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19022, March 30, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Benjamin P. Palomique filed a verified petition with the Supreme Court to declare Woodworks, Inc., its officers, agents, and contractors in contempt of court [1]. Palomique alleged that they committed gross violations of a writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Supreme Court on November 18, 1961 [1]. The respondents charged with contempt filed a verified answer supported by sworn statements denying the acts imputed to them [1]. The allegations in the petition and the answer presented conflicting accounts of the facts [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court should refer the case to the trial court for the reception of evidence regarding the conflicting allegations of contempt.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court found that the questions of fact arising from the petition, the answer, and the supporting documents were of importance and required the presentation of evidence by the parties to resolve the conflicting contentions [2]. Consequently, the Court deemed it necessary to refer the matter to the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur—the jurisdiction where the alleged acts were committed—for the reception of evidence and the submission of a report and recommendation to the Supreme Court [2, 3].

The matter and pertinent papers were ordered forwarded to the lower court for the reception of evidence [2, 4].
