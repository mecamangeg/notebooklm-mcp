I. CAPTION
DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-13439, January 31, 1962, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On January 30, 1956, the SS Taiwan shipped 13 bales of printed cotton piece goods from New York to Manila, consigned to the order of Security Bank and Trust Company with arrival notice to Vistan, Geraldez & Co., Ltd. Upon arrival on March 9, 1956, the cargo was discharged into the custody of the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service (MPS). MPS delivered only 12 bales to the consignee; one bale was missing.

Domestic Insurance Company, the insurer, paid the claim of P1,586.45 to the insured and filed an action against MPS and Manila Railroad Company to recover said amount. The Court of First Instance of Manila ordered the defendants to pay the full value of P1,586.45. The defendants appealed, admitting liability but arguing that under the Management Contract—referenced in the Delivery Permit and Gate Pass used by the consignee—their liability should be limited to P500.00 per package [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the liability of the arrastre operator is limited to P500.00 per package under the Management Contract.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court modified the lower court's decision, limiting the liability to P500.00.

The Court held that where a consignee takes delivery of goods by virtue of a Delivery Permit and Gate Pass which incorporate the provisions of the Management Contract limiting the arrastre operator's liability to P500.00 per package, the consignee is bound by such provision. This applies unless the consignee can prove that the value of the missing cargo was otherwise specified or manifested, which was not done in this case. The Court relied on established jurisprudence, specifically *Jose Bernabe, Inc. vs. Delgado Brothers, Inc.* (G.R. No. L-14360) and *Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. vs. Manila Port Service* (G.R. No. L-16271) [5, 6].

Accordingly, the judgment was modified, ordering the appellants to pay the appellee the sum of P500.00 only [7].
