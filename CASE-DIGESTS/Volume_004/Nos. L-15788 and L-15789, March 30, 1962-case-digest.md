I. CAPTION
POTENCIANO ILUSORIO, TERESA ILUSORIO, and MANUEL SISON vs. HON. GUILLERMO SANTOS, as Judge, Court of Agrarian Relations, and SANTIAGO PANGILINAN, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-15788 and L-15789, March 30, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondents, eighteen tenants working irrigated ricelands owned by petitioners Ilusorio in San Miguel, Bulacan, filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) for the reliquidation of their crop shares from the 1951-1952 agricultural year onwards. Before 1954, only one crop was planted annually; thereafter, two crops were raised: *dayatan* (planted May, harvested October) and *kalaanan* (planted October, harvested February). For the *dayatan* crop, tenants did not bundle or stack the harvest as required by Section 38 of Republic Act No. 1199, because the October harvest occurred during the rainy season, necessitating immediate threshing to prevent rotting.

The CAR classified the landholdings as second-class ricelands based on the average yield of 40 cavans or less per crop, treating each crop period as a distinct agricultural year. Consequently, the CAR ordered a liquidation on a 75-25 share basis in favor of the tenants, and directed petitioners to pay deficiency shares, reimburse excessive irrigation fees collected, and pay attorney's fees. Petitioners appealed, arguing that an "agricultural year" should cover a 10-month period or combine both crops for classification purposes, and that the claim for years prior to 1954 was prescribed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N each crop period constitutes an independent "agricultural year" for the purpose of classifying the land and computing average yield.
2. W/N the tenants' failure to perform bundling and stacking for the *dayatan* crop was justified.
3. W/N the irrigation fees were correctly apportioned between landholders and tenants.
4. W/N the claim for reliquidation for crop years prior to 1954 is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the term "agricultural year" bears no relation to any fixed length of time but is solely predicated on the interval between the preparation of the land and planting of the seed up to the harvesting of the crops. Under Section 5(c) of R.A. 1199, this period may be shorter or longer than a calendar year. The raising of two harvests on irrigated land was known when the Rice Tenancy Acts were enacted; the law's silence on combining them emphasizes that each crop period is an independent agricultural year. Thus, the CAR correctly classified the land as second-class based on the yield of individual crops.

2. **YES.** The tenants' failure to gather, bundle, and stack the *dayatan* harvest was justified by the need for immediate threshing to avoid rotting due to the rainy season in October. This omission cannot be used to reduce the tenants' shares.

3. **YES.** Under Republic Act No. 34, tenants are liable only for the maintenance of irrigation systems, while landlords bear the cost of construction. Therefore, the entire fee cannot be charged to the tenants. In the absence of specific figures distinguishing these costs, the division of irrigation charges in proportion to the benefits derived (shares in the harvest) is in accord with justice and equity.

4. **NO.** The defense of extinctive prescription is waived if not pleaded in due time. Petitioners failed to plead the 3-year limitation in the lower court and cannot invoke it for the first time on appeal.

The decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations is **AFFIRMED**.
