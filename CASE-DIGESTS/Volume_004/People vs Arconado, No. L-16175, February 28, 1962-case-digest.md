I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LORETO ARCONADO, G.R. No. L-16175, February 28, 1962, Labrador, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On November 11, 1958, in Gabu Sur, Laoag, Ilocos Norte, Leoncio Racacho approached a group of men, shouting insults and physically assaulting several individuals, including throwing sand at Luis Arconado [3]. When the accused, Loreto Arconado (Luis's son), arrived at the scene, Racacho embraced him, leading to a fight during which Loreto stabbed Racacho [4]. During the trial, Loreto pleaded guilty but sought to prove mitigating circumstances [5]. The trial court allowed him to prove minority and voluntary surrender but ordered his counsel to stop when he attempted to present evidence of incomplete self-defense, subsequently denying the motion to reopen the case for that purpose [2, 5]. Loreto appealed the order denying him the opportunity to prove incomplete self-defense [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in denying the accused the opportunity to present evidence of incomplete self-defense after a plea of guilty.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while the trial court has discretion to permit or deny the submission of evidence regarding mitigating circumstances after a plea of guilty, this discretion is not absolute [6, 7]. Such discretion must be exercised in accordance with the facts and circumstances of the case and should not prevent the disclosure of details that would mitigate the accused's responsibility [7, 8]. The Court reasoned that rules of procedure are not designed to curtail the disclosure of real facts, and if the circumstances justify a claim of incomplete self-defense, the accused must be allowed to submit evidence to ensure criminal law is applied with justice and fairness [6, 7]. The Order was set aside, and the case was remanded to the lower court for the admission of the proffered evidence [1].
