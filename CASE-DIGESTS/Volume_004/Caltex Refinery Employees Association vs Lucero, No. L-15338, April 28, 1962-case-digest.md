I. CAPTION
CALTEX REFINERY EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION-PAFLU v. HON. JUDGE ANTONIO LUCERO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15338, April 28, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On March 25, 1959, petitioner Union delivered a strike notice to the Conciliation Service, but due to holidays, it was recorded only on March 30. The Union asserted the 30-day cooling-off period expired April 23, while respondent Caltex (Philippines) Inc. argued it began March 30 [1, 2]. Alleging the threatened strike violated Section 14 of Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act) and would cause irreparable injury, Caltex filed a petition for injunction with the Court of First Instance of Manila, requesting an *ex parte* restraining order [2]. On April 23, 1959, the respondent Judge issued the order restraining the strike after hearing only Caltex's witnesses [3]. The Union filed this petition for certiorari after its motion for reconsideration was denied [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court could validly issue an *ex parte* restraining order against the Union's planned strike.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that under Section 9(a) of Republic Act No. 875, no court has jurisdiction to issue a restraining order in any case growing out of a labor dispute to prohibit a strike [4]. The strike is a weapon granted by law to employees to protect their interests [5]. The only exception is under Section 10, where the President certifies a dispute in an industry indispensable to the national interest to the Court of Industrial Relations [4].

Furthermore, even if a restraining order were permissible to prevent an illegal strike or property damage, it cannot be granted *ex parte* [5]. Section 9(d) of R.A. 875 strictly requires a hearing with due notice where parties can cross-examine witnesses, and a specific finding that public officers are unable or unwilling to protect the property [5, 6]. Since the respondent Judge failed to follow this procedure, the order was illegal [7].

Petition granted; the order of the respondent court is set aside [7].
