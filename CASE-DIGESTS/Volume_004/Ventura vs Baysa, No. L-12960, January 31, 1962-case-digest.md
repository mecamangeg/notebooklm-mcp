I. CAPTION
CIRILO VENTURA, ET AL. v. ANASTACIA BAYSA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-12960, January 31, 1962, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On May 12, 1950, petitioners (plaintiffs) filed an action for partition of two parcels of land in Tarlac against respondents (defendants). The lands were covered by Original Certificates of Title registered in the name of Agaton Claridad, the parties' common ancestor [1, 2]. After the issues were joined, the case was set for hearing on March 12, 1951, where parties announced a potential amicable settlement. However, they failed to submit any agreement [3]. The hearing was reset to November 19, 1951, but was postponed because the defendants' counsel was not served notice [3].

For over four years after this postponement, the plaintiffs took no steps to prosecute the case. Consequently, on March 2, 1956, the trial court *motu proprio* dismissed the case for failure to prosecute [3, 4]. The plaintiffs appealed, arguing that the duty to set the case for trial lay with the Clerk of Court, not them [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court properly dismissed the case for failure to prosecute.
2. W/N the dismissal should have the effect of an adjudication upon the merits (with prejudice).

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the dismissal was proper. Under Section 3, Rule 30 of the Rules of Court, a court may dismiss a case *motu proprio* when the plaintiff fails to prosecute for an "unreasonable length of time" [6]. A lapse of more than four years without any move from the plaintiffs is unreasonable [6]. The Court rejected the plaintiffs' argument regarding the Clerk of Court, holding that the Clerk's duty to calendar cases does not relieve plaintiffs of their own duty to prosecute diligently and call the court's attention to neglected cases [5].

2. **NO.** The Court modified the effect of the dismissal. While a dismissal for failure to prosecute generally operates as an adjudication on the merits, the Court held that meritorious claims should not be defeated by mere technicalities [7]. Since the lands involved were covered by Torrens titles registered in the name of the parties' common ancestor, the plaintiffs' claim for partition appeared meritorious [7].

The order of the trial court is **MODIFIED** declaring the dismissal to be **without prejudice** [8].
