I. CAPTION
ALLIED WORKERS' ASSOCIATION OF THE PHILIPPINES (AWA) SAN CARLOS CHAPTER v. PHILIPPINE LAND-AIR-SEA LABOR UNION (PLASLU), SINFOROSO KYAMKO and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. Nos. L-15447-48, January 31, 1962, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Allied Workers' Association (AWA) and San Carlos Milling Company had a collective bargaining and union shop agreement. Respondent Sinforoso Kyamko, an employee since 1948 and an AWA member, joined respondent union PLASLU. AWA expelled Kyamko and demanded his dismissal pursuant to the union shop agreement. The Company dismissed Kyamko on February 18, 1956. In protest, PLASLU members staged a strike on April 12, 1956. PLASLU filed unfair labor practice cases against the Company and AWA. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled that the collective bargaining agreement had not been validly renewed and ordered the reinstatement of Kyamko and the striking workers with back wages. AWA appealed, arguing the agreement was in force and justified the dismissal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the union shop agreement authorizes the dismissal of an old employee who ceases to be a member of the contracting union.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that a union shop agreement authorizing the dismissal of employees who cease to be members of the union applies only to **new** employees and cannot apply to **old** employees.

Relying on the final decision in the related case *San Carlos Milling Co., Inc. v. Court of Industrial Relations* (G.R. Nos. L-15453 and L-15723), the Court held that Kyamko, being an old employee, was not covered by the union shop clause. Consequently, his dismissal constituted an unfair labor practice, and the subsequent strike was legally justified. However, since the Company acted in good faith believing the dismissal was valid under the agreement, the award of back wages was reduced to one-half, covering the period from the refusal of reinstatement until actual reinstatement.

Decision modified.
