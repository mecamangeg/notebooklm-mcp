I. CAPTION
VICTORIAS MILLING COMPANY, INC. v. SOCIAL SECURITY COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-16704, March 17, 1962, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On October 15, 1958, the Social Security Commission (SSC) issued Circular No. 22, mandating that effective November 1, 1958, employers must include all bonuses and overtime pay in the computation of employee remuneration for premium contributions [1]. This circular was issued following the enactment of Republic Act No. 1792, which amended the Social Security Law (Republic Act No. 1161) [2]. Under the original law, bonuses and overtime pay were expressly excluded from the definition of "compensation," but the amendatory RA 1792 deleted these specific exemptions [3].

Petitioner Victorias Milling Company, Inc. protested the circular, arguing it contradicted a previous circular (No. 7) and constituted a rule or regulation that required Presidential approval and publication in the Official Gazette to be valid [4]. The SSC overruled the objections, holding that Circular No. 22 was merely an administrative interpretation of the statute, not a rule [5]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Circular No. 22 requires Presidential approval and publication in the Official Gazette to be effective.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that Circular No. 22 is a mere administrative interpretation, not a rule or regulation, and thus does not require Presidential approval or publication to be effective [6, 7].

The Court distinguished between administrative rules and administrative interpretations. A rule "makes" new law with the force of a valid statute and requires compliance with specific promulgation procedures (such as publication) [8, 9]. In contrast, an administrative interpretation merely renders an opinion or statement of policy regarding a pre-existing law and is advisory in nature [8, 10].

Circular No. 22 did not add any duty or detail not already present in the amended law [6, 7]. It simply advised employers that, due to the amendment by RA 1792 which deleted the specific exclusions for bonuses and overtime pay from the definition of "compensation," such items must now be included in premium computations [11, 12]. When a statute specifically defines a term, that definition controls over general legal meanings; the clear mandate of RA 1792 required the inclusion of these payments regardless of prior constructions [11-13].

The Resolution appealed from is affirmed [12].
