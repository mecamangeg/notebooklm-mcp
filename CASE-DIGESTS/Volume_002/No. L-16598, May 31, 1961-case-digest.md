I. CAPTION
HON. FRANCISCO JOSE, GEORGE EDWARD KOSTER, INC., MACARIO OFILADA, and EXCHANGE INVESTMENT, LTD. v. JOSE C. ZULUETA and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-16598, May 31, 1961, 2 SCRA 575, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Zulueta was the defendant in a civil case where the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila ordered him to pay George Edward Koster, Inc. roughly P46,000.00 with 6% interest. This decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-9305. On April 27, 1957, Zulueta paid the principal amount to the liquidator of Koster, Inc. Subsequently, Exchange Investments, Ltd. (transferee of Koster, Inc.) sought to collect the accrued interest. The CFI granted an *alias* writ of execution for the interest on January 16, 1959.

Zulueta filed a motion for reconsideration, which the CFI denied on March 12, 1959. Zulueta received notice of this denial on March 17, 1959. Instead of filing an appeal, Zulueta filed a petition for *certiorari* with the Court of Appeals (CA) on April 18, 1959—32 days after receiving the denial—claiming the interest had been condoned. The CA granted the petition and set aside the writ of execution. Petitioners then filed this review with the Supreme Court, arguing that *certiorari* was improper because Zulueta had already lost his right to appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the remedy of *certiorari* is proper when the right to appeal has been lost through the petitioner's own negligence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court reversed the Court of Appeals. Under Section 1, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court (now Rule 65), a writ of *certiorari* requires that the tribunal acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion, *and* that there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law [1, 2].

The Court held that the CFI orders issuing the writ of execution and denying the motion for reconsideration were appealable orders [3]. Since Zulueta failed to appeal within the reglementary period without valid justification, he lost that right [3]. A petition for *certiorari* cannot be used as a substitute for a lost appeal [4, 5].

While the Court acknowledged the doctrine in *Santos v. Pecson*—where *certiorari* may be allowed if an appeal is inadequate to prevent impending injury (e.g., execution has commenced)—this exception applies only when the right to appeal *still exists* [6, 7]. It cannot be invoked when the right to appeal has already been extinguished due to the party's fault or negligence [7, 8].

Petition granted. The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the orders of the CFI are affirmed [9, 10].
