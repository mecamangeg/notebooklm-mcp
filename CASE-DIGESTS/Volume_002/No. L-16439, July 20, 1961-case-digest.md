I. CAPTION
ANTONIO GELUZ v. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS and OSCAR LAZO, G.R. No. L-16439, July 20, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Nita Villanueva, wife of respondent Oscar Lazo, voluntarily had an abortion performed by petitioner Antonio Geluz on February 21, 1955, terminating a two-month pregnancy for a fee of P50.00. This was her third abortion performed by Geluz; the first two occurred in 1950 and 1953. Lazo, who was away campaigning for an election, did not consent to the abortion. He filed a suit for damages against Geluz. The Court of First Instance of Manila rendered judgment for Lazo, awarding P3,000.00 in damages and attorney's fees. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, predicating the P3,000.00 award on Article 2206 of the Civil Code, which fixes the minimum indemnity for the death of a person.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a husband can recover damages under Article 2206 of the Civil Code for the death of an unborn fetus.
2. W/N the husband is entitled to moral damages under the circumstances.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The award of P3,000.00 based on Article 2206 is erroneous because that provision applies to the death of a "person," and an unborn fetus is not endowed with juridical personality. Under Article 40 of the Civil Code, the provisional personality of a conceived child is expressly prohibited by the condition that it be subsequently born alive [1]. Since the fetus was dead when separated from the mother, it acquired no personality, and consequently, no right of action for pecuniary damages could derivatively accrue to its parents [2, 3].

2. **NO.** While parents of an unborn child may recover moral damages for the "illegal arrest of the normal development of the *spes hominis*" (distress and disappointment of parental expectations) under Article 2217, or exemplary damages under Article 2230 [4], the facts of this case do not warrant such an award. The record showed Lazo was indifferent to his wife's two previous abortions and failed to take administrative or criminal action against the physician, indicating his concern was "mercenary" rather than a result of moral anguish [5, 6].

The decision appealed from is reversed, and the complaint is ordered dismissed.
