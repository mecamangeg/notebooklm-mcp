I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RENATO DELFIN, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-15230 and L-15979-81, July 31, 1961, 2 SCRA 911, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On January 26, 1957, in Naval, Leyte, accused Renato Delfin and Eladio Delfin went to the store of Sy Leng Hag. When refused beer, Renato became aggressive. Ang Giok Chuan ("Chuana"), the owner's niece, intervened, and Renato slapped her to ridicule her. Chuana's brother, Francisco Ang ("Ekiong"), investigated the commotion and engaged in a fistfight with Renato. During the fight, Eladio suddenly stabbed Francisco from behind, causing serious wounds. Renato fled to the store of his brother-in-law, accused Hoc Seng. Hoc Seng handed Renato a licensed pistol, saying, "Here you shoot, kill anyone of them. I will be responsible." Renato then intercepted Ang Ban (Francisco's father) on the street. Despite Ang Ban raising his hands in surrender, Renato shot him dead.

The Court of First Instance of Leyte convicted Renato of Murder (for Ang Ban), Slander by Deed (for Chuana), Illegal Possession of Firearm, and Frustrated Murder (for Francisco). Eladio was convicted of Frustrated Murder. Hoc Seng was convicted of Murder as a principal by induction. They appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court had jurisdiction over the slander charge.
2. W/N Renato is guilty of illegal possession of a firearm despite possessing it for only a few minutes.
3. W/N Hoc Seng is criminally liable for the death of Ang Ban as a principal by induction.
4. W/N Renato is liable for the frustrated murder of Francisco committed by Eladio.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The jurisdiction of a court in criminal cases is determined by the allegations of the complaint or information, not by the result of proof [1]. Furthermore, the act of slapping a woman to ridicule and shame her before others constitutes the felony of Slander by Deed under Article 359 of the Revised Penal Code, which falls within the court's jurisdiction [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The seizure of a firearm by one who is not licensed, with the intention of using it unlawfully, constitutes the crime punishable under Republic Act No. 4, regardless of how brief the possession was [3]. *Animus possidendi* was present because Renato took the gun specifically to use it [4].

3. **YES.** Hoc Seng is liable as a principal by induction because his moral influence over Renato and his act of handing over the weapon with the command to "kill anyone" were the determinative factors that moved Renato to kill [5, 6]. However, the Court ruled he is guilty only of **Homicide**, not Murder, because there is no evidence he induced Renato to employ treachery in the killing [3, 6].

4. **NO.** The prosecution failed to prove conspiracy between Renato and Eladio regarding the stabbing of Francisco [7]. The stabbing was an unexpected turn of events during the fistfight which Renato could not have foreseen. Consequently, Renato was acquitted of the frustrated murder charge, while Eladio's conviction for the same was affirmed [8].

**Disposition:** Judgment modified. Renato Delfin is convicted of Murder, Slander by Deed, and Illegal Possession of Firearm, but acquitted of Frustrated Murder. Eladio Delfin is convicted of Frustrated Murder. Hoc Seng is convicted of Homicide.
