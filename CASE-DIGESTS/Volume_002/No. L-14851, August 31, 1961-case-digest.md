I. CAPTION
INTESTATE ESTATE OF MARCELO DE BORJA; DR. CRISANTO DE BORJA, administrator, JUAN DE BORJA, ET AL. v. JOSE DE BORJA, administrator of the TESTATE ESTATE OF JOSEFA TANGCO, G.R. No. L-14851, August 31, 1961, 2 SCRA 1131, Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
In a previous case (G.R. No. L-6622), the Supreme Court affirmed a decision ordering Crisanto de Borja to pay Juan de Borja, et al. the sum of P46,210.78 plus interest [1]. After the decision became final, a writ of execution was issued [2]. The sheriff levied on the rights, interest, and participation of Crisanto de Borja as a prospective heir of the decedents Josefa Tangco and Francisco de Borja in certain real estate in Rizal [2].

Jose de Borja, administrator of the estate of Josefa Tangco, filed a third-party claim, arguing that the properties belonged to the estate under liquidation in Special Proceedings No. 7866 and were thus *in custodia legis* [2]. The sheriff required the judgment creditors (Juan de Borja, et al.) to post a bond of P2,500,000.00 [2]. The judgment creditors questioned the necessity of the bond in court, while the administrator questioned the propriety of the levy [2]. The lower court ruled that the levy was proper and ordered the sheriff to proceed without a bond [2]. The administrator appealed [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the interest of an heir in the estate of a deceased person may be attached for execution pending the settlement of the estate.
2. W/N the judgment creditors are required to post a bond for the execution to proceed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The interest of an heir in the estate of a deceased person may be attached for purposes of execution, even if the estate is in the process of settlement before the courts [3]. This is permitted under Section 14, Rule 39, in connection with Section 7(f), Rule 59 of the Rules of Court, which allows the attachment of "the interest of the defendant in property belonging to the estate of a decedent, whether as heir, legatee etc." [3]. Citing *Cook v. Escobar*, the Court held that while the administrator retains control over the properties to pay debts, the heir's right and interest may be attached subject to said administration [3].

2. **NO.** The judgment creditors are not required to file a bond because there is no real conflict of interest involved [4]. A bond is generally required for third-party claims, but here the administrator does not dispute that the judgment debtor, Crisanto, is an heir of the decedent [4]. Since the attachment is subject to the administration of the estate, there is no conflict between the attached interest of the heir and the interest of the estate represented by the administrator [4].

The appealed order is AFFIRMED [5].
