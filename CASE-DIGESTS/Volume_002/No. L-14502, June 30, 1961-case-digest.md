I. CAPTION
FEDERICO PINEDA v. DOMINGO CABAÑGON and MARCELINO TIAMZON, G.R. No. L-14502, June 30, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Federico Pineda filed a complaint in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) to dispossess respondent tenant Marcelino Tiamzon for refusing to adopt the "Masagana System" of planting and for allegedly neglecting the land due to his activities with the Federation of Free Farmers. On July 23, 1958, the CAR rendered judgment dismissing Pineda's petition, finding that the low yield was caused by pests rather than the farming method or Tiamzon's union work. Pineda filed a motion for reconsideration, which the CAR denied on September 18, 1958. On October 9, 1958, Pineda filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court, alleging the CAR acted with grave abuse of discretion. The petition, however, failed to state the specific dates when Pineda received notice of the judgment and the order denying his motion for reconsideration.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition should be dismissed for failing to establish that it was filed within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the petition raised issues of fact which are not proper subjects for a special civil action for certiorari. Moreover, even if considered as a petition for review, it must be disallowed. Under Section 13 of Republic Act No. 1267 (as amended by Republic Act No. 1409), a petition for review of a CAR judgment must be filed within fifteen days from receipt of notice. The Court held that the petition was defective because it did not state the dates of receipt of the notices of the judgment and the order denying the motion for reconsideration. Without these dates, the Court could not determine if the petition was filed within the statutory fifteen-day period.

Petition denied.
