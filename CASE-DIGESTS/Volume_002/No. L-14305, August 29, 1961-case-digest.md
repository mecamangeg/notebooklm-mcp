I. CAPTION
GAUDENCIO T. MENDOZA v. MAXIMO M. ALCALA, G.R. No. L-14305, August 29, 1961, Natividad, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Mendoza previously filed an information for *estafa* against Defendant Alcala based on a receipt for P1,100.00, alleged to be an advance payment for 100 cavans of palay [1], [2]. The trial court acquitted Alcala in the criminal case, ruling that there was "sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that there had been no deceit or misrepresentation" and that the receipt was "not what it purports to be," concluding that any obligation incurred was "purely civil in character" [3].

Subsequently, Mendoza filed the present civil action for the collection of the money. The parties stipulated that this civil case involved the same transaction as the criminal case [4]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, reasoning that under Rule 107, Section 1(d) of the Rules of Court, the acquittal extinguished the civil action because the finding that the receipt was "not what it purports to be" meant the fact from which civil liability might arise did not exist [5], [6]. Mendoza appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved purely questions of law [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the acquittal of the defendant in the *estafa* case bars the subsequent independent civil action for the collection of the amount involved.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal and remanded the case. The Court held that the civil action was not barred because the decision in the criminal case did not contain an express declaration that the fact from which the civil action might arise did not exist [7]. Under Article 29 of the Civil Code, a civil action may be instituted if the acquittal is based on reasonable doubt. Although the criminal court did not explicitly state "reasonable doubt," its finding that guilt was not "satisfactorily established" and that the liability was "purely civil" allows for such an inference [8], [7].

Furthermore, the criminal court's statement that any obligation was "purely civil in character" amounted to a reservation of the civil action in favor of the offended party [9]. Finally, since the crime charged was *estafa* (fraud), the civil action could proceed independently of the criminal action pursuant to Article 33 of the Civil Code [9].

**Disposition:** Judgment set aside and case remanded to lower court for further proceedings [10].
