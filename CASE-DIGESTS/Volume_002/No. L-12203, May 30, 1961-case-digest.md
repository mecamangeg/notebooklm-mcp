I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS v. FARM IMPLEMENT AND MACHINERY CO., G.R. No. L-12203, May 30, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On August 3, 1954, a shipment of 100 packages arrived in Manila from Hong Kong. The importation documents, including the commercial invoice and Central Bank release certificate, declared the goods as "semolina" under Commodity Code No. 040802 [1]. Upon examination, Customs authorities discovered the shipment contained "sotanghon," which they classified as "vermicelli" under Commodity Code No. 040804-UI [1]. Consequently, the shipment was seized and declared forfeited by the Collector of Customs for violation of Central Bank Circular No. 44 in relation to Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code [1]. The Commissioner of Customs affirmed the forfeiture. On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) reversed the Commissioner's decision and cancelled the surety bond filed for the release of the goods [1, 2]. The Commissioner of Customs petitioned the Supreme Court for review [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the "sotanghon" shipment falls under Commodity Code No. 040804-UI ("vermicelli") rather than Commodity Code No. 040802 ("semolina"), rendering it subject to forfeiture.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that "sotanghon" falls under Commodity Code No. 040804-UI. Citing its previous ruling in *Farm Implement and Machinery Co. v. Commissioner of Customs* (G.R. No. L-12260, May 30, 1960), the Court explained that "sotanghon" should be classified as "vermicelli" because it is a preparation similar to "macaroni, spaghetti, noodle and vermicelli," which are the preparations covered by that specific code [3]. Since the shipment falls under the unclassified item category (UI) and not the code declared in the importation papers, the importation was irregular and subject to forfeiture [3, 4].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **REVERSED** and the decision of the Commissioner of Customs is **AFFIRMED**.
