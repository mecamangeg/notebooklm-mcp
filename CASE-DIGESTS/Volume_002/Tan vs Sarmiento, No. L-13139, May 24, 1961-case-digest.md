I. CAPTION
In the Matter of the Petition of Tan Chu Keng to be Admitted as a Citizen of the Philippines. TAN CHU KENG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-13139, May 24, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On September 15, 1955, Tan Chu Keng filed a petition for naturalization with the CFI of Cebu. He claimed exemption from filing a Declaration of Intention (DOI) under Commonwealth Act No. 535, citing continuous residence in the Philippines for over 30 years. In his petition, he listed only three children (Domingo, Esperanza, and Bienvenido). However, during cross-examination by the provincial fiscal, it was revealed that he had two other children, Espiritu and Alfonso, from a previous marriage in China. Tan Chu Keng explained he excluded them because they were already of age and married. The evidence further showed that Espiritu only reached the second year of high school and Alfonso only reached Grade IV, meaning neither completed the required education. The CFI granted the petition, but the Republic appealed based on the non-inclusion of the children and the failure to strictly comply with education requirements.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure of the petitioner to include the names of all his children in the petition is a ground for denial.
2. W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a Declaration of Intention despite failing to give primary and secondary education to all his children.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 7 of the Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473) expressly requires the petitioner to state the name, age, birthplace, and residence of *each* of the children. The law does not distinguish between minor children and those of age; therefore, the Court should not distinguish. The petitioner's failure to list Espiritu and Alfonso—facts only elicited during cross-examination—violated this requirement. Compliance with all statutory requirements is mandatory (Lau Lang Sin v. Republic).

2. **NO.** To be exempt from filing a Declaration of Intention under Commonwealth Act No. 535 based on 30 years of residence, an applicant must prove that he has given primary and secondary education to *all* his children in public or government-recognized private schools. Since Tan Chu Keng admitted that his children Espiritu and Alfonso did not complete their secondary and primary education respectively, he did not satisfy the conditions for exemption. Consequently, his failure to file a Declaration of Intention within the prescribed time is fatal to his application (Yu Hiang v. Republic).

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition for citizenship is **DENIED**.
