I. CAPTION
MITHI NG BAYAN COOPERATIVE MARKETING ASSOCIATION, INC. v. J. ANTONIO ARANETA, Collector of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. L-14575, July 31, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Mithi ng Bayan, organized under the Cooperative Marketing Law (Act No. 3425), operated a rice mill in Laguna where it milled palay for both members and non-members for a fee [1]. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) assessed petitioner for deficiency fixed and percentage taxes amounting to P3,590.53 [2, 3]. Petitioner paid the amount under protest and claimed a refund, arguing it was exempt from taxes under the Cooperative Marketing Law [4, 5]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) denied the refund, ruling that petitioner was not validly organized under Act No. 3425 because its by-laws allowed the admission of members who were not engaged in the production of agricultural products [6]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is exempt from taxes as a cooperative marketing association under Act No. 3425.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner is not entitled to the tax exemption provided in Section 48 of the Cooperative Marketing Law (Act No. 3425) [7, 8].

Under Sections 3 and 7 of Act No. 3425, a cooperative marketing association must be organized by and composed of persons engaged in the production of agricultural products [9, 10]. The Court found that Section 1, Article IV of the petitioner's by-laws allowed any resident of the municipality who paid a fee and bought a share to become a member, regardless of whether they were agricultural producers [11, 12]. The Court held that once an association admits non-producers as members, the reason for its existence—to promote the orderly marketing of products for producers—ceases to operate, and the tax exemption privilege is withdrawn [7]. Since the petitioner failed to prove that all its members were agricultural producers, it cannot be considered a legitimate cooperative marketing association under the law [8].

The judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [13].
