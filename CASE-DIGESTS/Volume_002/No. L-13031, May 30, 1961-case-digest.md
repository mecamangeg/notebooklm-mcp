I. CAPTION
INTESTATE ESTATE OF JAMES R. BURT, deceased. THE PHILIPPINE TRUST CO., administrator-appellee, vs. LUZON SURETY Co., INC., surety-appellant, G.R. No. L-13031, May 30, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Francis R. Picard, Sr. was appointed Administrator of the Intestate Estate of James R. Burt with a P1,000.00 bond secured by appellant Luzon Surety Co., Inc. [1]. Later, the probate court dismissed Picard and appointed Philippine Trust Co. as the new administrator [1]. An inventory revealed that Picard had made unauthorized disbursements amounting to approximately P8,000.00, failing to deliver the remaining funds to the new administrator [2, 3]. Picard was subsequently convicted of estafa and held civilly liable [3, 4].

The probate court issued an order requiring Luzon Surety to show cause why the bond should not be confiscated [4]. Luzon Surety moved to set aside the order, arguing that the probate court could not *ex proprio motu* prosecute the bond and that the surety was released from liability because it received no notice of the proceedings determining the administrator's accountability [4, 5]. The lower court denied the motion and ordered the confiscation of the bond [4]. Luzon Surety appealed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the probate court has the power to order the forfeiture of an administrator’s bond *motu proprio*.
2. W/N the surety is bound by the judgment against the administrator despite not receiving notice of the accounting proceedings.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that a probate court possesses "all-embracing power" not only in requiring and fixing the amount of the administrator's bond but also in executing or forfeiting it [6, 7]. The execution or forfeiture of an administrator's bond is deemed a necessary part and incident of the administration proceedings [6, 7].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the surety is liable. From the nature of the obligation on an administrator's bond, the surety is bound and concluded by a judgment against the principal in the absence of fraud and collusion [8]. This applies even if the surety was not a party to the proceedings against the administrator or was not notified prior to the confiscation order [8]. While a surety is not entitled to notice, it may be allowed to intervene in the settlement of accounts if it asks for leave to do so in due time [7, 9]. Furthermore, the bond condition was that Picard would faithfully execute court orders; his unauthorized disbursements violated this, binding the surety [10].

Decision affirmed [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Barrera, J., took no part [11].
