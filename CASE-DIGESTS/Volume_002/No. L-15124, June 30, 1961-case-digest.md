I. CAPTION
**DOMINGA ANTONIO, et al. v. JOSE RAMOS, et al., G.R. No. L-15124, June 30, 1961, Paredes, J.**

II. FACTS
On January 3, 1953, plaintiffs Dominga, Dominador, Lauro, and Pablo Antonio filed a complaint for the recovery of real property against defendants Jose Ramos, Leonora Ramos, and Nicolas Francisco. While Francisco answered, the other defendants were declared in default. The reception of plaintiffs' evidence was scheduled for August 20, 1956. However, neither Francisco nor his counsel appeared on said date, despite the counsel having received the notice of hearing as early as March 24, 1956 [1]. Consequently, the trial court allowed plaintiffs to present evidence ex parte and rendered a decision in their favor on August 23, 1956 [2].

Francisco filed a Motion for New Trial, alleging accident, mistake, and excusable negligence. His counsel claimed he received the registered envelope containing the notice on March 24, 1956, but lost it before opening or reading its contents. He argued that had he opened it, he would have noted the date in his calendar as per his habit [3, 4]. The trial court denied the motion, ruling that the counsel's negligence was not excusable given he had months to verify the nature of the notice from court records [5, 6]. The case was certified to the Supreme Court on purely legal issues [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the counsel’s failure to attend the hearing, due to losing the unopened notice of hearing, constitutes excusable negligence warranting a new trial.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the allegation of counsel that he forgot to note the notice of hearing in his calendar is flimsy and does not constitute the accident, mistake, or excusable negligence contemplated by Section 1(a), Rule 37 of the Rules of Court [8, 9].

The Court emphasized that the exercise of ordinary prudence could have guarded against such mistake. Lawyers have a special duty to be vigilant and evaluate the urgency of registered letters from courts. The counsel admitted receiving the notice months prior to the hearing; his failure to open it immediately or verify its contents from court records during the intervening five months displayed a lack of diligence [9, 10]. Furthermore, the Court noted that granting a new trial would not substantially change the result, as the evidence strongly supported the plaintiffs' ownership [10].

**The orders appealed from are AFFIRMED.**

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
