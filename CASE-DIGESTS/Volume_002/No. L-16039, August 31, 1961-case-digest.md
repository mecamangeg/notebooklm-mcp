I. CAPTION
CENTURY INSURANCE COMPANY, INC. v. F. A. FUENTES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16039, August 31, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Cesar M. Pablico was employed as an accountant for Century Insurance Company, Inc. from June 1, 1950, to December 6, 1958. On December 22, 1958, he gave written notice to the company that he had contracted pulmonary tuberculosis during his employment and filed a claim for compensation with the Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor on December 23, 1958. Century Insurance filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the claim was barred by the Statute of Limitations under Section 24 of Act No. 3428, as it was filed more than two months after July 1, 1957, the date Pablico allegedly first notified the company of his illness. The hearing officer denied the motion. Century Insurance then filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI granted the petition, enjoining the labor officials from hearing the claim on the ground that the late filing deprived the Commission of jurisdiction. The labor officials appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Workmen's Compensation Commission loses jurisdiction to hear a claim if it is filed beyond the statutory period prescribed in Section 24 of Act No. 3428.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the mere fact that a claim is presented beyond the period prescribed by statute is not a ground for holding that the Commission lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine the claim. The question of timely presentation is a factual issue to be determined by the Commission itself during the hearing [1].

Jurisdiction is the authority to hear and determine a cause, which is distinct from the exercise of that jurisdiction. If the Commission errs in finding that a claim was filed within the statutory period when it was not, such error is committed in the *exercise* of jurisdiction and is reviewable by appeal, not by a writ of prohibition [1, 2]. Citing *Herrera v. Barreto* and *Napa v. Weissenhagen*, the Court emphasized that jurisdiction does not depend on the regularity of the exercise of power or the correctness of the decision made [3]. Consequently, the CFI erred in issuing the writ of prohibition.

The decision of the Court of First Instance is set aside [4].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
