I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CALIXTO MAMALAYAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-11210, May 30, 1961, 2 SCRA 88, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On July 19, 1955, Ng Poi Gong, a Chinese merchant, was kidnapped in Canlubang, Laguna, by several armed men while delivering bread. Her driver was released to convey a ransom demand of P100,000 to her family. The victim was detained for six days in various locations until she was rescued by authorities. No ransom was paid, and no bodily injury was inflicted upon her. The appellants, Calixto Mamalayan, Vicente Cabrera, Telesforo Talatala, and Mariano Panganiban, were identified by the victim and other witnesses. The Court of First Instance of Laguna found them guilty of kidnapping for ransom under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code and sentenced them to death, with a recommendation to the President for commutation to life imprisonment. The appellants appealed, raising the defense of alibi and presenting a recantation affidavit from a prosecution witness.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi and the recantation of a prosecution witness can overcome the positive identification of the appellants.
2. W/N the death penalty was correctly imposed.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the defense of alibi is inherently weak and cannot prevail over the clear, precise, and positive identification by prosecution witnesses who were well-acquainted with the appellants [1]. Specifically, the victim and her companions categorically identified the accused. Furthermore, the recantation of prosecution witness Pedro Castillo via a subsequent affidavit was deemed unreliable, as his previous testimony was given freely and voluntarily, and his close relationship with the appellants precluded the possibility of mistaken identity [2]. The Court also noted that the appellants' attempts to evade arrest betrayed their guilt [3].

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the judgment, ruling that the penalty imposed is in accordance with the last paragraph of Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Acts Nos. 18 and 1084, which mandates the death penalty for kidnapping for the purpose of extorting ransom [4]. The judgment, including the death sentence (and implicitly the lower court's recommendation for executive clemency), was affirmed.
