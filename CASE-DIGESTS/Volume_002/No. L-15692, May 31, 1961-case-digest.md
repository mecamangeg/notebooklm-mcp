**I. CAPTION**
ENGRACIA ALARCON v. JUAN ALARCON, G.R. No. L-15692, May 31, 1961, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
On June 3, 1955, defendant Juan Alarcon, a school teacher, hired Urzino Azaña and his brother to dig a well on his land in Caramoan, Camarines Sur [1, 2]. On the following day, Urzino resumed work with a new co-worker. While being lowered into the hole, Urzino fainted. Despite rescue attempts, he died of asphyxia [1, 3].

The plaintiff, Engracia Alarcon (Urzino's mother), filed an action to recover compensation for her son's death under Article 1711 of the Civil Code [3]. The Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur dismissed the complaint, ruling that the defendant, not being an owner of an enterprise or an employer in industry or business, was not liable under Article 1711 [4]. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the defendant, a school teacher who hired a casual laborer to dig a well, is liable for compensation under Article 1711 of the Civil Code. [5]

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal [6].

The Court ruled that the defendant does not fall under the coverage of Article 1711 of the Civil Code, which imposes liability on "owners of enterprises and other employers." Applying the principle of *ejusdem generis*, the term "other employers" must be construed to refer to persons belonging to a class analogous to "owners of enterprises," such as those operating a business or engaged in a particular industry or trade [2]. The defendant was merely a school teacher who needed a well, not a business owner [2].

Furthermore, Article 1711 states the philosophy underlying the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 3428) and must be interpreted in relation to it [7]. Under Section 39(b) of Act No. 3428, the term "laborer" excludes a person whose employment is "purely casual and is not for the purposes of the occupation or business of the employer" [8]. Since Urzino's employment was purely casual and not for the purpose of the defendant's occupation, he was not covered by the Act [8]. Consequently, there was no legal basis to hold the defendant liable for the accidental death.

The decision appealed from is affirmed [6].
