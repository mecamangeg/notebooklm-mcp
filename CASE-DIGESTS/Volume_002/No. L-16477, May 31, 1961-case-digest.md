I. CAPTION
MANILA TRADING & SUPPLY CO. v. MARIANO MEDINA, G.R. No. L-16477, May 31, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On May 7, 1956, Mariano Medina executed a promissory note for ₱60,000.00 in favor of Manila Trading & Supply Co., payable in monthly installments of ₱4,000.00 plus 12% interest. The note stipulated that failure to pay any installment would render the unpaid balance immediately due and demandable.

On January 8, 1957, Manila Trading filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, alleging Medina failed to pay installments from September 1956 to January 7, 1957. A writ of attachment was issued against Medina’s buses. Medina admitted the execution of the note and his failure to pay the monthly installments in his Answer, but later, during trial, presented ten additional receipts allegedly eaten by termites (*anay*) to prove he was not in default.

The CFI rejected the additional receipts as suspicious due to mutilations on the serial numbers and inconsistencies with the company's receipt issuance sequence. The trial court ruled in favor of Manila Trading. Medina appealed, arguing, among others, that his possession of genuine receipts dated January 1957 raised the presumption that prior installments had been paid.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the presentation of receipts for subsequent installments raises a conclusive presumption that prior installments were paid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the presumption that prior installments were paid upon the presentation of a receipt of payment subsequent thereto is only *prima facie*.

In this case, the receipts dated January 1957 did not recite that they were issued for the installments corresponding to that specific month. Even if they did, the resulting presumption is merely rebuttable. The presumption was successfully rebutted by the evidence, which showed that the payments made did not correspond to the installments falling due on the dates of the genuine receipts. Furthermore, the appellant expressly admitted in his Answer his failure to meet the monthly installments from September 1956 to January 1957, and the trial court correctly found the additional "mutilated" receipts to be spurious as they bore numbers not in sequence and differed in form from genuine receipts issued during the relevant period.

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.
