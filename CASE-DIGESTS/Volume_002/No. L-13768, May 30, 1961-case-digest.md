I. CAPTION
FLORENCIO DEUDOR, ET AL. v. J. M. TUASON & CO., INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-13768, May 30, 1961, 2 SCRA 129, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners (the "Deudors") and Respondents (J.M. Tuason & Co.) entered into a Compromise Agreement on March 16, 1953, to settle civil cases involving 50 "quiñones" of land in Tatalon, Quezon City. The Deudors recognized Tuason's ownership and undertook to deliver peaceful and complete possession of the land. In exchange, Tuason agreed to pay the Deudors P614,925.74, subject to the condition of delivery. This agreement was approved by the Court of First Instance in a decision dated April 10, 1953.

Years later, the Deudors had failed to deliver the remaining 30 quiñones, and the number of illegal constructions (squatters) on the property increased. Upon Tuason's motion, the lower court issued an order on February 28, 1957, fixing a period of four (4) months for the Deudors to deliver possession, citing Article 1197 of the Civil Code. The order stated that failure to deliver would release Tuason from its payment obligations. The Deudors failed to comply. On January 10, 1958, the court issued an order releasing Tuason from its obligations and directing the issuance of a writ of possession. The Deudors appealed, arguing the court had no authority to amend the final compromise judgment by fixing a period or declaring Tuason's obligations extinguished.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the court may fix a period for the performance of an obligation in a compromise agreement approved by final judgment.
2. W/N the failure of the Deudors to deliver possession within the fixed period extinguished Tuason's obligation to pay.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Article 1197 of the Civil Code is part and parcel of all obligations contemplated therein. Although the Compromise Agreement did not specify a period, the nature of the obligation and circumstances (Tuason paying a large sum in expectation of possession) indicated a period was intended. By fixing the period, the court did not amend or modify the compromise judgment but merely enforced an implied stipulation of the parties incorporated into the decision.

2. **YES.** The obligation of Tuason to pay P614,925.74 was subject to the suspensive condition of the Deudors delivering "peaceful and complete possession" of the 30 quiñones. The four-month period fixed by the court constituted a resolutory period. When this period expired with the suspensive condition unfulfilled, the Deudors' right to comply was extinguished, and Tuason's conditional obligation to pay was terminated pursuant to Article 1193 of the Civil Code.

Orders affirmed.
