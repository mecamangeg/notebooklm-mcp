I. CAPTION
DIMITRY SUGANOFF v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16301, August 31, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On July 30, 1959, petitioner Dimitry Suganoff filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur for the reconstitution of his citizenship papers [1]. He alleged that he was issued Certificate of Naturalization No. 7 on January 16, 1930, and took his oath of allegiance on May 4, 1932, but all records were lost during the war [1]. In support of his petition, he submitted: (1) a copy of the Official Gazette showing the publication of the notice of his petition (Exh. A-1); (2) a photostat of an *unsigned* copy of the Certificate of Naturalization (Exh. B-2); and (3) a photostatic copy of a passport application containing an "Oath of Allegiance" (Exh. B-4) [2, 3]. The Provincial Fiscal opposed the petition, arguing that the exhibits were not authentic copies [4]. The trial court granted the petition, ruling that the documents were copies duly certified by their legal custodian [5, 6]. The Solicitor General appealed the decision [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the documents presented constitute authentic copies sufficient for reconstitution under Act No. 3110.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, holding that none of the documents submitted are "authentic" copies required by Section 7 of Act No. 3110 [8, 9]. The Court found that Exhibit B-2 was merely a photostat of an *unsigned* certificate [6, 10]. Furthermore, Exhibit B-4 was only a copy of a passport application; the oath therein was a requirement for the passport, not the oath taken upon the assumption of citizenship, and the signatures on the document were never identified [9, 11]. The certification from the US Embassy (Exh. B) relied upon by the trial court only certified the covering letter, not the authenticity of the attached photostats [11].

Since the records cannot be reconstituted with the evidence presented, the Court ruled that the proper remedy for the petitioner is to file his action anew, as provided in Section 30 of Act No. 3110 [8, 12].

The decision of the trial court is **REVERSED** and set aside [12].
