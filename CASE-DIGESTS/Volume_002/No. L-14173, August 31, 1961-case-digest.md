I. CAPTION
TOMAS RAMOS v. GENESIS L. DELIZO, represented by his mother, ILUMINADA L. DE JACOBE, and HON. TOMAS PANGANIBAN, Judge, Court of Agrarian Relations, G.R. No. L-14173, August 31, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Genesis Delizo filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) to dispossess petitioner Tomas Ramos from a landholding, intending to cultivate it personally [1]. The CAR set the hearing for November 21, 1957 [2]. On November 18, 1957, Ramos's counsel sent the original Answer with Counterclaim by registered mail [2, 3]. On November 19, counsel sent a motion for postponement by special delivery, attaching a duplicate copy of the Answer, which the CAR received on the morning of the hearing [3, 4].

Assuming the issues were joined upon receipt of the duplicate Answer, the CAR denied the postponement, proceeded with the hearing, and received Delizo's evidence ex parte [4, 5]. The original Answer was only received by the court on November 26, 1957 [4]. Subsequently, notices for continued hearings were sent to Ramos's former counsel rather than his counsel of record, resulting in Ramos's failure to present evidence [5, 6]. The CAR rendered a decision ordering Ramos to vacate the land [7]. Ramos filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the issues were joined at the time of the hearing on November 21, 1957.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the receipt of the duplicate copy of the Answer annexed to the motion for postponement did not constitute the "filing" of such answer as contemplated by the rules [9]. The enclosure of the duplicate was merely to support the motion for postponement [9]. Since the original Answer was sent by registered mail on November 18 but was not received by the court until November 26, 1957, the issues were not yet joined when the hearing commenced on November 21 [9]. Consequently, the proceedings held on that date were null and void [10]. Furthermore, the Court noted that Ramos was deprived of his right to be heard due to the lack of proper notice to his counsel of record for subsequent hearings [6, 11].

The petition is granted, the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations is set aside, and the case is remanded for further proceedings [12].
