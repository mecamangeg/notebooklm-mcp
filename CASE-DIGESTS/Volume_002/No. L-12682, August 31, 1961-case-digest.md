I. CAPTION
SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC. and COL. JOSE P. RUEDA v. PETER C. SANTOS and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-12682, August 31, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Peter C. Santos was employed intermittently as a temporary security guard by petitioner San Miguel Brewery (SMB) from 1952 to 1955 [1]. He became a member and confidential agent of the SMB Special Police Union, gathering evidence for charges the Union filed against petitioner Col. Jose P. Rueda, SMB's Security Officer [1, 2]. Subsequently, Rueda investigated Santos and ordered a medical examination, which revealed a chronic ear condition [3]. Although the Union recommended Santos to fill a permanent vacancy, SMB dismissed him in February 1955, alleging the physical defect as the cause [1, 3]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found petitioners guilty of Unfair Labor Practice (ULP), ruling that the dismissal was actually motivated by Santos' union activities [4]. The CIR ordered his reinstatement to the position of *permanent* security guard [4]. Petitioners appealed, arguing inter alia that the CIR *en banc* denial of their Motion for Reconsideration was invalid because only four judges participated (one was on leave) and that the order to reinstate to a permanent position was erroneous [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR *en banc* resolution is valid even if decided by only four judges.
2. W/N the petitioners are liable for Unfair Labor Practice for dismissing Santos.
3. W/N the CIR correctly ordered Santos' reinstatement to a permanent position.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The requirement that a motion for reconsideration be resolved by the court *en banc* simply demands that all *available* judges take part [7]. Under Commonwealth Act No. 559, as long as at least three of the attending judges concur, it is sufficient for the pronouncement of a decision or order [7].

2. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's findings, noting they were supported by substantial evidence and thus not reviewable [8]. The evidence showed Rueda was prejudiced against Santos for gathering information used in union charges against him [2]. The dismissal, while ostensibly based on a physical defect, was a pretext for retaliation against union activities [2]. Although Rueda's motives may have been personal, he acted in his capacity as Security Officer, and SMB ratified his acts by dismissing Santos with knowledge of the circumstances, thereby becoming liable for the ULP [9].

3. **NO.** Reinstatement refers to a "restoration to a state from which one has been removed or separated" [10, 11]. Since Santos was a *temporary* guard at the time of his dismissal, he cannot be reinstated to a position he had not previously occupied [12, 13]. The CIR erred in ordering his appointment as a permanent guard [11].

**Disposition:** The decision is MODIFIED; Santos is ordered reinstated to his former position of temporary guard [11, 14].
