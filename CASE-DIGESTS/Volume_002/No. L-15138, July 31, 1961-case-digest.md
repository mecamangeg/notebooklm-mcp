I. CAPTION
BILL MILLER, et al. v. ATANACIO A. MARDO, et al., G.R. Nos. L-15138, L-16781, L-15377, L-16660, & L-17056, July 31, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Five consolidated cases involve money claims (unpaid wages, overtime, separation pay) filed by employees against their employers with the Regional Offices of the Department of Labor [1]. These claims were filed pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, drafted by the Government Survey and Reorganization Commission under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 997 [1]. The Plan granted Regional Offices original and exclusive jurisdiction over such money claims [2].

The employers challenged the jurisdiction of the Regional Offices in various Courts of First Instance (CFI), arguing that the Commission lacked the authority to confer judicial powers on administrative bodies. The CFIs issued conflicting rulings: some declared the Plan invalid and issued writs of prohibition against the Regional Offices (Miller, Chin Hua Trading), while others upheld the Plan or dismissed court actions in favor of the Regional Offices (Raganas, Romero, Fred Wilson) [3], [4], [5], [6], [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is valid insofar as it grants Regional Offices of the Department of Labor jurisdiction over money claims.

IV. RULING
**NO.** Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is invalid and of no effect insofar as it confers judicial power to Regional Offices over cases other than those falling under the Workmen’s Compensation Law [8].

**Improper Delegation of Judicial Power:** R.A. No. 997 authorized the Commission to reorganize the Executive Branch, which does not include the creation of courts [9]. Judicial power is vested exclusively in the Supreme Court and such inferior courts as may be established by law (Sec. 1, Art. VIII, Constitution) [9]. The Legislature cannot delegate its power to legislate or create courts of justice to any other agency [10]. While the legislature may confer quasi-judicial powers incidental to administrative functions, such conferment must be express and clearly limited, which was not the case here [11].

**Unconstitutionality of "Legislative Inaction":** The Court rejected the argument that the Plan became law because Congress failed to disapprove it under Sec. 6(a) of R.A. No. 997 [12]. Enactment of law by legislative inaction is not countenanced in this jurisdiction [13]. The Constitution requires positive and separate action by each House (printing, three readings, voting) and presentation to the President for approval or veto (Sec. 21(a) and Sec. 20(1), Art. VI, Constitution) [13], [14]. The procedure in Sec. 6(a), allowing approval by silence or adjournment, violates these constitutional requirements and bypasses democratic processes [15], [16].

Consequently, the decisions in *Miller* and *Chin Hua Trading* (declaring the Plan void) are **AFFIRMED**. The decisions in *Raganas*, *Romero*, and *Fred Wilson* (upholding the Plan/dismissing court cases) are **REVERSED** and **SET ASIDE** [17], [18].
