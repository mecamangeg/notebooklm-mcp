I. CAPTION
CARLOS PELLICER v. LAUREANO RUIZ, G.R. No. L-14300, May 30, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Carlos Pellicer, the owner of agricultural lands in Pangasinan mortgaged to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC) and Philippine National Bank (PNB), entered into a contract to sell the properties to Laureano Ruiz for P200,000.00 [1]. Under the agreement (later modified by Exhibit F), Ruiz assumed the mortgage obligations and agreed to pay the balance of the purchase price [2]. Ruiz and his father also executed a promissory note binding themselves to apply the proceeds of any loan or sale of the property to the unpaid purchase price [3].

Ruiz failed to pay the agreed installments and did not secure the full conformity of the banks for the assumption of mortgages [2, 4]. Although Ruiz and his father obtained a P60,500.00 loan from the RFC, they failed to apply any portion of it to the balance of the purchase price, violating the promissory note [5]. Furthermore, Ruiz harvested the 1956-1957 crops but did not apply the proceeds to the bank amortizations, exposing the properties to foreclosure [5, 6]. Pellicer sent a notice of rescission, to which Ruiz did not protest, and Pellicer subsequently took possession of the land [6, 7]. Pellicer filed an action for rescission and damages. The lower court granted the rescission and issued a writ of preliminary injunction to protect Pellicer's possession [8, 9]. Ruiz appealed, questioning the validity of the rescission and the issuance of the injunction.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the rescission of the contract of sale was justified.
2. W/N the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The rescission was justified due to substantial breaches by the defendant. The Court found that Ruiz violated the terms of the promissory note by failing to apply the proceeds of the P60,500.00 RFC loan to the balance of the purchase price [10]. Additionally, his failure to apply his share of the crops to the bank amortizations risked foreclosure, which was contrary to his contractual assumption of the mortgages [5, 10]. The Court also noted that Ruiz's silence and failure to protest the notice of rescission suggested an admission of the validity of Pellicer's claims [11, 12]. The non-application of funds to the debt warranted the exercise of the right to rescind the contract [10, 13].

2. **YES.** The writ was properly issued. Although the lower court termed it a "mandatory" injunction, the order merely commanded Ruiz to "desist" from molesting Pellicer's possession, making it an ordinary prohibitory injunction [14, 15]. The Court found that Pellicer had already secured possession with Ruiz's acquiescence prior to the suit [7, 16]. Furthermore, the injunction was necessary to ensure that crop proceeds were applied to the overdue agricultural loans to forestall the imminent danger of foreclosure by the PNB and RFC [7, 16].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED [17].
