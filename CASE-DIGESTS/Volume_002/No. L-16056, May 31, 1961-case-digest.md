I. CAPTION
LUZ BALLESTEROS, ET AL. v. OLIVA CAOILE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16056, May 31, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On November 1, 1947, plaintiffs Ballesteros et al. filed an application for land registration, which defendants Caoile et al. opposed. Upon the petition of plaintiffs' counsel, the hearing was postponed several times. The court eventually set the hearing for September 8, 1949. On this date, neither the plaintiffs nor their counsel appeared, despite the fact that their counsel was duly notified. Consequently, the trial court dismissed the plaintiffs' application, allowed the oppositors to present evidence, and subsequently decreed the registration of the land in the name of the oppositors. Almost ten years later, plaintiffs filed an action for reconveyance and cancellation of title with the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan. They argued that the previous judgment was null because they were deprived of their day in court, alleging they received no notice of the hearing from the court or their former counsel. The trial court dismissed the complaint.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the judgment in the registration case is valid and binding despite plaintiffs' claim that they did not receive personal notice of the hearing.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the plaintiffs' failure to appear was not due to a lack of notice but due to their own negligence. The record established that their counsel was duly notified of the hearing. Under the Rules of Court, notice to counsel is notice to the party he represents, and notice of hearing should be served upon counsel if the party has any, unless the court directs otherwise (Section 2, Rule 27). The plaintiffs' claim that their former counsel failed to notify them is untenable. Moreover, the Court noted that plaintiffs failed to file a petition for relief under Rule 38 and waited almost ten years to file the instant action, making them guilty of laches.

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
