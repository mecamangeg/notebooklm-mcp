I. CAPTION
ATLAS CONSOLIDATED MINING AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION v. THE HON. JOSE M. MENDOZA and CONSTANCIA D. VEGA, G.R. No. L-15809, August 30, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On April 27, 1957, petitioner Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation (Atlas) filed a Lode Lease Application with the Director of Mines. Respondent Constancia D. Vega subsequently informed the Director of her adverse claim over the same mineral areas. The Director advised Vega that since the notice of Atlas's application had not yet been published (a requirement for filing adverse claims under Section 72 of the Mining Act), she should instead file a verified protest under Section 61 [1].

Disregarding this advice, Vega filed a civil case against Atlas in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu, alleging ownership of the claims and illegal encroachment by Atlas [1, 2]. Atlas filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the Bureau of Mines had exclusive jurisdiction and that Vega failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Judge Mendoza denied the motion and set the case for trial [3, 4]. Atlas filed this petition for prohibition to enjoin the lower court from proceeding, insisting the court lacked jurisdiction [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court has jurisdiction over the subject matter despite the respondent's failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the lower court retains jurisdiction. The Mining Act provides two procedures for settling conflicting claims: one before publication (Section 61) and one during publication (Sections 72 and 73) [6]. Since the notice had not yet been published, Vega should have followed the procedure in Section 61, which requires the Director of Mines to hear and settle the conflict first [6].

However, the Court ruled that while Vega was bound to follow this administrative procedure, her failure to do so merely affects her cause of action, not the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter [7]. Citing *Miguel v. Vda. de Reyes* and related jurisprudence, the Court explained that non-exhaustion of administrative remedies is not a jurisdictional defect [7]. Consequently, the writ of prohibition, which lies only when a court acts without or in excess of jurisdiction, was improper.

Petition dismissed.
