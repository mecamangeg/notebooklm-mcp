I. CAPTION
EMILIO GALANG, as Commissioner of Immigration v. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS and TEE HOOK CHUN, G.R. No. L-15569, May 30, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Tee Hook Chun arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on May 12, 1958, claiming to be a Philippine citizen with a Philippine passport [1]. After an investigation, the Petitioner Commissioner of Immigration found him to be an alien using a false name and ordered his exclusion on May 21, 1958, under Section 29(a)(17) of the Immigration Act of 1940 for being undocumented [1].

Instead of immediate exclusion, the Fiscal filed a criminal case against Tee Hook Chun for violating Section 45(e) of the same Act (falsely representing oneself as a Filipino) [1]. The Court of First Instance convicted him, sentencing him to imprisonment and fine, with a provision for deportation after service of sentence [2]. Tee Hook Chun appealed to the Court of Appeals and posted bail, which the trial court approved, ordering his release [3]. However, the Petitioner refused to release him, citing the standing warrant of exclusion [3]. The Court of Appeals granted Tee Hook Chun’s petition for *habeas corpus*, ruling that the institution of the criminal action constituted a waiver of the administrative exclusion and rendered the exclusion warrant ineffective [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the institution of a criminal action against an alien for violation of the Immigration Act waives the Commissioner of Immigration's authority to detain and exclude him under a separate administrative warrant.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the criminal proceeding and the administrative exclusion proceeding are entirely different and distinct, even if they arise from the same facts [6]. The warrant of exclusion was based on Section 29(a)(17) for lack of proper documentation, while the criminal charge was under Section 45(e) for fraudulent representation of citizenship [6, 7]. These are distinct offenses not legally inconsistent with each other; thus, the prosecution of one does not entail a waiver of the other [8].

The Court reasoned that the conflict between the proceedings is merely physical (regarding time and place of custody), not legal [9]. The Commissioner may simply postpone the actual exclusion until the alien has served his criminal sentence [10]. Furthermore, the authority of a court to grant bail springs from its jurisdiction over the accused in the criminal case; it does not bind a detaining officer holding the accused under a valid warrant issued by another authority in a separate administrative proceeding [11]. If an alien could secure release on bail in a criminal case despite a valid exclusion warrant, it would defeat the purpose of the law by allowing those bent on entering the country to "beat" exclusion proceedings by welcoming criminal prosecution [12].

The petition is granted, and the decision of the Court of Appeals is set aside [13].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Reyes, Paredes, Dizon, De Leon, and Natividad concurred. Justices Labrador and Barrera took no part [14].
