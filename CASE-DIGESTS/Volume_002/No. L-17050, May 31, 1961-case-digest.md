**I. CAPTION**
ATLANTIC MUTUAL INSURANCE Co. v. MACONDRAY & Co., INC., ET AL., MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-17050, May 31, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. (Petitioner) sued Macondray & Co., Inc. (carrier's agent) and Manila Port Service (MPS) (arrastre operator) for P532.86, representing damage to a shipment of Holy Scriptures consigned to Bible House, Philippines [1]. The parties stipulated that the carrier discharged the shipment into the custody of MPS "complete and in good order," except for three cases not involved in the dispute [2]. Subsequent inspections requested by the consignee revealed that several cases were wet and injured [2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ordered MPS and Manila Railroad Company to pay the damages and absolved Macondray [3]. MPS appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved purely questions of law based on stipulated facts [3, 4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Manila Port Service is liable for the damaged cargo.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. The evidence stipulated that MPS received the cargo from the carrier "complete and in good order" [4]. Since the damage was discovered while the goods were in the possession of MPS (having been in their custody for about ten days prior to delivery), the obvious inference is that the damage occurred while in MPS's possession [4]. The Court applied the legal principle that "loss or damage while in the possession of an obligor is presumed due to its fault in the absence of contrary proof" (citing Civil Code, Art. 265) [4]. MPS failed to rebut this presumption [4]. Additionally, the Court rejected MPS's defense regarding the management contract because it was not properly presented in the trial court and could not be considered for the first time on appeal [5]. The judgment against MPS was affirmed [5].
