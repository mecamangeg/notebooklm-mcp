I. CAPTION
MACONDRAY & COMPANY, INC. v. PERFECTO PIÑON, ET AL. (RUPERTO K. KANGLEON, deceased, substituted by VALENTINA TAGLE-KANGLEON, ET AL.), G.R. No. L-13817, August 31, 1961, 2 SCRA 1109, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On January 30, 1954, defendant Ruperto K. Kangleon, then a Senator, wrote a letter to Macondray & Company, Inc. introducing defendants Perfecto Piñon and Conrado Piring (known as "Tugak" and "Pugak" of "All Stars Productions"). Kangleon requested Macondray to facilitate the defendants' purchase of cinematographic films and stated, "for which by their guaranty I pledge payment" [1], [2]. Relying on this letter, Macondray sold and delivered films worth P6,985.00 to Piñon and Piring on credit, payable by May 9, 1954 [3], [4].

When Piñon and Piring failed to pay on the due date, Macondray demanded payment from Kangleon [3], [5]. Kangleon requested time to contact the principal debtors but did not deny the guaranty [6], [7]. Macondray subsequently filed a complaint against the principal debtors and Kangleon. Piñon and Piring were declared in default [8]. Kangleon argued that his letter was merely an introduction or an unaccepted offer of guaranty, and that the actual terms of the sale varied from his offer, extinguishing his liability [9], [10]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Macondray, ordering Piñon and Piring to pay, and Kangleon to pay subsidiarily if the principal debtors failed to satisfy the judgment [11], [12]. Kangleon appealed but died pending the appeal; he was substituted by his heirs [13].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Kangleon's letter constituted a valid and binding contract of guaranty.
2. W/N notice of acceptance by the creditor to the guarantor was necessary for the guaranty's validity.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the letter constituted a valid contract of guaranty. Kangleon's phrase "I pledge payment" indicated a clear undertaking to guarantee the principal debtors' obligation [14]. Under Article 1356 of the Civil Code, contracts are obligatory in whatever form they may be entered into, provided all essential requisites are present [15]. A contract of guaranty is not formal; it is valid in any form as long as it complies with the Statute of Frauds [15]. Furthermore, the variation in the cost (P6,985 actual vs. P7,070 estimated) and the due date did not extinguish the guaranty because the changes were merely in kind and did not make the obligation more onerous [10].

2. **NO.** Notice of acceptance was not necessary. The Court explained that the contract between Macondray and the principal debtors was the principal contract, while Kangleon's undertaking was subsidiary [15]. Once the principal contract was perfected, the subsidiary contract of guaranty became effective and binding immediately [15]. Therefore, no separate notice of acceptance by the creditor to the guarantor was required for its validity [15], [16].

**Judgment affirmed.** [17]
