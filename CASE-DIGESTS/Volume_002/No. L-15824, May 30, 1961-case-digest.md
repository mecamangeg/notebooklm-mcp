I. CAPTION
RICARDO M. GUTIERREZ v. HON. ARSENIO SANTOS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15824, May 30, 1961, Dizon, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Benigno Musni and others filed a complaint with the Secretary of Public Works and Communications against Petitioner Ricardo Gutierrez for allegedly constructing illegal dams and dikes across navigable waters in Macabebe, Pampanga [2]. Gutierrez filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga to stop the administrative investigation, arguing the waters were private [3, 4]. The case was assigned to Branch I, presided over by Respondent Judge Arsenio Santos [4]. Respondent Rogelio de la Rosa moved to disqualify Judge Santos on the ground that in 1948, the Judge, then a private practitioner, had acted as counsel for other fishpond owners in an administrative investigation involving similar streams and had argued they were private in nature [5, 6]. Judge Santos issued an order disqualifying himself, not because he was counsel for Gutierrez, but because his prior legal opinion on the private nature of the streams might influence his decision [7, 8]. Gutierrez moved for reconsideration, which was denied, prompting him to file a petition for mandamus to compel Judge Santos to hear the case [9, 10].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Mandamus lies to compel the respondent Judge to hear the case despite his voluntary disqualification. [10]

IV. RULING
**NO.** Mandamus will not lie. The Supreme Court held that while the grounds for disqualification under Section 1, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court (now Rule 137) are specific, the law's true intention is to ensure that no judge shall preside in a case unless they are wholly free, disinterested, impartial, and independent [11]. Due process requires a hearing before an impartial and disinterested tribunal, and every litigant is entitled to the "cold neutrality of an impartial judge" [11].

In this case, Judge Santos candidly admitted that the opinion he expressed in 1948 regarding the private nature of the streams "might, some way or another, influence his decision" [12]. The Court found that this fear of not being able to render a truly impartial judgment was not capricious or whimsical, considering his prior representation of clients with interests identical to the petitioner's [12]. Consequently, his inhibition was proper to avoid any suspicion as to the fairness and integrity of the court [11].

Petition denied [13].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS (if any)
None. [13]
