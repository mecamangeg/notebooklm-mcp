I. CAPTION
BLUE BAR COCONUT COMPANY v. ISABELO S. HILARIO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-12699, May 31, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Isabelo S. Hilario and his wife executed a mortgage in favor of Blue Bar Coconut Company (Blue Bar) and the Philippine Desiccated Coconut Corporation (PDCC) to secure a loan of P148,466.58 and future advances. The mortgage contract expressly stipulated that the obligation was joint and several and consolidated in favor of Blue Bar as the sole mortgagee. Blue Bar and PDCC subsequently paid off the Hilario spouses' prior mortgage with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, making Blue Bar the first mortgagee.

Following Hilario's death, his heirs substituted him. Blue Bar filed a complaint for foreclosure of the mortgage when the total indebtedness reached P316,871.75. The defendants admitted the debt but argued they failed to pay because PDCC breached a separate agreement (Annex 1) for the purchase of desiccated coconut, which caused their factory's collapse. Consequently, defendants filed a counterclaim for damages against Blue Bar and moved to include PDCC as a third-party defendant.

The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan denied the motion to include PDCC and the motion to postpone the trial for a witness to testify on the counterclaim. The trial court ruled in favor of Blue Bar, ordering the foreclosure of the mortgage and dismissing the counterclaim.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in denying the motion to include PDCC as a third-party defendant.
2. W/N Blue Bar is liable for damages arising from the alleged breach of contract by PDCC.
3. W/N the trial court erred in denying the motion for postponement.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The motion to include PDCC was fatally defective. Under Rule 12 of the Rules of Court, a third-party complaint is proper only if the defendant is entitled to contribution, indemnity, subrogation, or any other relief from the third party "in respect to the plaintiff’s claim." The defendants failed to allege any such grounds connecting PDCC to Blue Bar’s foreclosure claim [1, 2]. Furthermore, the mortgage contract explicitly designated Blue Bar as the sole mortgagee for all legal incidents [3].

2. **NO.** Blue Bar was not a party to the separate agreement (Annex 1) executed solely between Isabelo Hilario and PDCC. Only parties to a contract can be held liable for damages for a breach thereof [1, 4]. Consequently, the counterclaim against Blue Bar for PDCC’s alleged breach was correctly dismissed for lack of legal basis and evidence [5].

3. **NO.** The granting of a motion for postponement is discretionary and will not be disturbed absent grave abuse of discretion [2, 6]. The defendants had ample time to prepare, and the proposed witness testimony regarding PDCC’s breach of contract was irrelevant to the foreclosure action filed by Blue Bar [5].

Decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
