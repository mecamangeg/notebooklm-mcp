I. CAPTION
**NATIONAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION v. MINERVA L. MORADA**, Adm. Case No. 321, July 31, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Minerva L. Morada, a lawyer and notary public employed as a clerk for P.V. Agana & Associates, was charged with malpractice [1, 2]. On August 2, 1957, she notarized an affidavit purportedly sworn to by her employer, Pedro V. Agana, requesting the release of 15,300 bags of cement for the Pototan-Dingle Road project [1, 3]. At the time of notarization in Manila, Agana was physically present in Bacolod City [1]. Agana had signed the documents in advance and sent them to Morada with instructions to facilitate the release of materials [4]. Morada admitted to authenticating the document in the affiant's absence but claimed she acted without malice and upon the specific instructions of Agana, whose signature she knew was genuine [1, 4]. The Office of the Solicitor General investigated and found that Morada acted without malice [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N respondent Morada committed gross misconduct warranting disbarment by notarizing an affidavit in the absence of the affiant.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that while the practice of administering an oath in the absence of the affiant is **censurable** in a notary public, it is not so serious as to constitute gross misconduct warranting disbarment under **Section 25, Rule 127 of the Rules of Court**, particularly when done without malice [5, 6].

Relying on the doctrine in *Viuda de Veloso v. Madarang* (61 Phil. 773), the Court agreed with the Solicitor General that such an irregularity calls for a lighter penalty than disbarment [5].

Accordingly, the respondent was **ADMONISHED** to be henceforth more careful in the performance of her duties as a notary public and as a member of the Bar, with the warning that a repetition of similar acts will be dealt with more drastically [7].
