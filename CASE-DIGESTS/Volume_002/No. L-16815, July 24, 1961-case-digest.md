I. CAPTION
ARSENIO L. CANLAS and ADENA GONZALES-CANLAS v. HON. BERNABE DE AQUINO and JAIME TAYAG, G.R. No. L-16815, July 24, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, Dr. Arsenio Canlas and Dr. Adena Gonzales-Canlas, established a private hospital in Concepcion, Tarlac [1]. Respondent Jaime Tayag obtained a permit to construct a ricemill directly across the street from the hospital [1]. Although the municipal health officer revoked Tayag's permit citing a nuisance ordinance, Tayag continued construction [1, 2]. Petitioners filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 3512) to enjoin the construction, arguing that the smoke, dust, and noise from the ricemill would harm their patients and the hospital's operations [3]. The trial court issued a writ of preliminary injunction on October 22, 1959 [4].

Subsequently, Tayag filed an *unverified* motion to dissolve the injunction, alleging he would suffer great damage and offering to post a bond [4]. Respondent Judge Bernabe De Aquino granted the motion and dissolved the injunction on February 4, 1960 [4]. The Judge justified the dissolution based on "very reliable information" received privately that modern ricemills do not cause noise or smoke, stating he would inspect the mill after construction to verify if it was a nuisance [5]. Petitioners filed this petition for certiorari alleging grave abuse of discretion [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in dissolving the writ of preliminary injunction based on an unverified motion and private information.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court annulled the order dissolving the injunction [6]. The Court held that the respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction [5].

First, under Rule 60, Section 6 of the Rules of Court, a motion for the dissolution of a writ of preliminary injunction must be verified [7]. Respondent Tayag's motion was unverified and merely reproduced the language of the rules without alleging specific facts to support his abstract conclusions [7, 8].

Second, the Judge erred seriously by relying on private, extra-judicial "reliable information" regarding the operation of ricemills rather than evidence on record [5]. The Judge's reasoning—that he would allow the construction and only enjoin it later if found to be a nuisance—rendered the main action futile, as the harm sought to be prevented would have already occurred [9].

Finally, the Court emphasized that the operation of a hospital affects the health and welfare of the community. The potential damage to the patients and the public from the ricemill's operation is not fully compensable, satisfying the requirement for an injunction, whereas the respondent's potential damages were merely financial [8, 9].

The order of February 4, 1960, was annulled [6].
