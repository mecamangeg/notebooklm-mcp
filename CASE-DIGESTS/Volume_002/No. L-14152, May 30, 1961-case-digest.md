I. CAPTION
JUSTITA MANUEL, ET AL. v. FELIXBERTA MANUEL, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14152, May 30, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On January 31, 1956, plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendants in the Court of First Instance of Zambales for the recovery of two parcels of land. During the hearing on September 5, 1957, neither the parties nor their counsel appeared. Consequently, the trial court issued an order dismissing both the complaint and the defendants' counterclaim.

Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Reconsideration on September 30, 1957, alleging excusable negligence, which the court denied on December 6, 1957. On December 18, 1957, plaintiffs filed a Second Motion for Reconsideration, praying that the dismissal order be amended to be "without prejudice." On February 6, 1958, the trial court granted this motion and amended the decision. Defendants appealed, contending that the Second Motion for Reconsideration was *pro forma*, did not suspend the 30-day appeal period, and that the court had lost jurisdiction as the judgment had become final.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court had jurisdiction to amend its order of dismissal to be "without prejudice" based on the plaintiffs' Second Motion for Reconsideration.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. The Court held that the trial court retained jurisdiction because the Second Motion for Reconsideration was filed within the reglementary period. Calculating the dates, the first motion was filed only three days after receipt of the order, and the second motion was filed three days after receipt of the denial of the first. Thus, the 30-day period had not lapsed.

The Court ruled that when a motion for reconsideration is filed within the reglementary period and does not suffer from fatal defects, the duration of its pendency is not included in the computation of the appeal period [1]. Furthermore, under Section 5(g), Rule 124 of the Rules of Court, the court has the inherent power "to amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conformable to law and justice." Discarding technicalities regarding whether the motion was *pro forma*, the trial judge properly exercised sound discretion to amend the order to serve the ends of justice before the decision became final.

**Orders affirmed.**
