I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, ET AL. v. THE HONORABLE ANGEL MOJICA, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-18755, August 31, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On April 29, 1961, the Supreme Court affirmed the death penalty imposed on convict Marcial Ama y Perez. On July 25, 1961, the lower court fixed the execution date for August 4, 1961. However, on August 3, 1961, respondent Judge Angel Mojica issued an order suspending the execution and rescheduling it to September 4, 1961, upon the motion of the counsel *de oficio* [1, 2].

The Acting Director of Prisons filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that under the Constitution, only the President has the power to suspend the execution of a prisoner. Judge Mojica denied the motion on August 18, 1961, even after being informed that the President had already issued a reprieve for the convict ending on September 3, 1961 [2]. The petitioners filed a petition for certiorari challenging the validity of the Judge's order [1, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition challenging the Judge's authority to suspend the execution has become moot.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the issue has become moot. It appeared that the accused had been granted a reprieve by the President subsequent to the respondent Judge's order suspending the execution of the convict [4]. Consequently, the question of whether or not the Judge could have validly issued said order of suspension became moot [5].

The petition for certiorari is dismissed [3].
