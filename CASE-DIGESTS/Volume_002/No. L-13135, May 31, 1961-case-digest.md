I. CAPTION
ERIBERTO DEL ESPIRITU v. DOMINGO Q. DAVID and MAXIMINO TORRES, G.R. Nos. L-13135 & L-13136, May 31, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Eriberto del Espiritu, a landlord, filed separate complaints in the Justice of the Peace Court of Bacolor, Pampanga against his tenants, respondents Domingo Q. David and Maximino Torres, to collect sums of money for loans extended to them. The loans were for the purchase of carabaos, house repairs, firewood, medical care, and rice. The respondents moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, citing their tenancy relationship, but the lower court denied the motion and ruled in favor of the petitioner.

On appeal to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pampanga, the respondents again raised the issue of jurisdiction. The CFI dismissed the cases, ruling that the loans were used for cultivation expenses and subsistence, matters falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the loans were not for cultivation, that the CAR did not exist when the cases were filed, and that the respondents voluntarily submitted to the CFI's jurisdiction.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the collection of loans extended by a landlord to his tenants for items such as work animals and subsistence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the loans were intrinsically linked to the tenancy relationship. Under Section 15 of Republic Act No. 1199 (Agricultural Tenancy Act), a debt for the purchase of a carabao is connected with "cultivation, planting, harvesting and other incidental expenses for the improvement of the crop." Similarly, debts for house repairs, firewood, medical care, and rice constitute "advances for the subsistence of the tenant and his family."

Pursuant to Section 21 of R.A. No. 1199 and Section 7 of R.A. No. 1267, all disputes arising from the landlord-tenant relationship, including those occasioned by such loans, fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations. Although the cases were filed before the CAR was created, jurisdiction over tenancy disputes was transferred from regular courts to the Court of Industrial Relations (and subsequently the CAR) upon the approval of R.A. No. 1199. Furthermore, jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by law and cannot be conferred by the will of the parties.

The decision of the Court of First Instance dismissing the cases is **AFFIRMED**.
