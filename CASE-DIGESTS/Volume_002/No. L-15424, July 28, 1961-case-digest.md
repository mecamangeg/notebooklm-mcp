I. CAPTION
ALBERTO DE SANTOS, ET AL. v. HON. JOSE N. SANTOS and HERMOGENES IRENEO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15424, July 28, 1961, 2 SCRA 820, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners are landowners of "Hacienda No. 5" in Nueva Ecija, while respondents are their share-tenants [1]. For the agricultural year 1957-1958, the parties had written and registered tenancy contracts stipulating a 45-55 sharing ratio in favor of the petitioners [2]. These contracts expired at the end of said agricultural year [3]. On June 19, 1958, the tenants sent a registered letter to the petitioners notifying them of their intent to change the sharing arrangement to 70-30 in favor of the tenants for the 1958-1959 agricultural year [3]. The petitioners did not claim the letter, and the tenants proceeded to defray all expenses for the 1958-1959 crop [4, 5]. The Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) ruled in favor of the tenants, holding that the change was valid because notice was given "prior to the final harrowing and transplanting," even if the agricultural year had technically commenced [6, 7]. Petitioners appealed, arguing the option was not exercised on time [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the tenants validly exercised their right to change the crop-sharing arrangement for the 1958-1959 agricultural year.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the CAR judgment. Under Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199, if a share tenancy contract is in writing and duly registered, the tenant's right to change the crop-sharing arrangement may be exercised "at the expiration of the period of the contract" [9]. Furthermore, Section 5(c) of the same Act defines an "agricultural year" as the period necessary for raising seasonal products, expressly including "the preparation of the land" [10].

The Court found that when the tenants exercised their option on June 19, 1958, the 1957-1958 agricultural year had already ended, and the 1958-1959 agricultural year had already begun, as evidenced by the CAR's finding that the notice was prior to "final harrowing" (implying land preparation was underway) [11]. Since the notice was served after the new agricultural year had commenced, the option was not timely exercised for the 1958-1959 period [11]. The case was remanded to the CAR to determine the reimbursement due to the tenants for expenses petitioners would have contributed [12].
