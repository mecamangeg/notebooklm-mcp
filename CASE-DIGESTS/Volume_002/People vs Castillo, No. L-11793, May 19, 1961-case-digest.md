I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AMADOR CASTILLO, et al. (ILDEFONSO ALILLANA, Defendant-Appellant)**, G.R. No. L-11793, May 19, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On June 19, 1951, in San Pablo City, a group of armed men, including appellant Ildefonso Alillana, Amador Castillo, and others, went to the house of spouses Fermin Cornista and Amparo Alimario. Pretending to be Huks asking for food, they entered and ransacked the house, taking cash and articles worth P858. During the robbery, Castillo and other cohorts raped Amparo. Alillana remained downstairs initially as the alleged "Chief," but when he learned of the sexual assault, he became angry, reprimanded his companions, and fired shots in the air to hasten their departure.

The spouses did not report the crime until February 1954 (nearly three years later). They explained that in 1951, the area was infested with Huks and they feared the malefactors' threats to liquidate them. Alillana set up the defense of alibi, claiming he was a military informer conducting operations elsewhere, and questioned the credibility of the witnesses due to the delay in reporting. The trial court convicted Alillana of Robbery with Rape and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the delay of three years in reporting the crime destroys the credibility of the prosecution witnesses.
2. W/N the appellant is liable for the complex crime of Robbery with Rape.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The delay was satisfactorily explained and does not impair credibility. The Court held that the silence was justified because in 1951, peace and order were unsolved problems in the barrio, with many Huks in the vicinity and people disappearing. The spouses reported the crime in 1954 only after peace was restored. Furthermore, it is inconceivable that a married woman of good reputation would cast aside her modesty and admit to being raped if it were not true [1, 2].

2. **NO.** (Implicitly, based on the penalty modification). While the appellant's guilt as a participant in the robbery was proven beyond reasonable doubt by positive identification [3], the Court modified the judgment. The Court found doubt as to whether Alillana was the "leader" of the band to warrant the maximum penalty under Article 295 of the Revised Penal Code, noting that he was challenged by Castillo when he reprimanded the group for the rape [4].

The Court sentenced Alillana to a minimum of 6 years and 1 day to 8 years of *prision mayor* and a maximum of 8 years and 1 day to 10 years of *prision mayor*, and to indemnify the spouses P858. The penalty imposed corresponds to robbery, distinguishing his liability from the acts of rape committed by his companions which he opposed [5].

**Judgment modified.**

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
