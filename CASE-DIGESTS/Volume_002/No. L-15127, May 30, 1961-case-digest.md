I. CAPTION
EMETERIO CUI v. ARELLANO UNIVERSITY, G.R. No. L-15127, May 30, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Emeterio Cui was a law student at Arellano University, where he received scholarship grants for scholastic merit throughout his studies. Before being awarded these scholarships, he was made to sign a contract waiving his right to transfer to another school without refunding the equivalent of his scholarship cash to the University [1].

For his last semester, Cui transferred to Abad Santos University to follow his uncle, Dean Francisco R. Capistrano, who had moved there [2]. When Cui applied to take the bar examination, he needed his transcript of records from Arellano University. The University refused to release it unless he refunded the P1,033.87 total in scholarship grants he had received. Cui paid the amount under protest [2, 3].

The Director of Private Schools had issued Memorandum No. 38, s. 1949, stating that scholarship stipulations prohibiting transfer without refund are against the principle of merit [4]. Despite this, the Court of First Instance of Manila upheld the contract, ruling that the Memorandum was not a law and the stipulation was valid, even if potentially unethical [5]. Cui appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the contractual stipulation requiring a scholar to refund scholarship grants upon transferring to another school is void.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The stipulation is null and void for being contrary to public policy [6, 7].

The Supreme Court held that scholarships are awarded in recognition of merit and to help gifted students in whom society has an established interest or a first lien, not to keep outstanding students in school to bolster its prestige or increase its business potential [6, 8]. While Memorandum No. 38 is not a law, it reflects sound public policy and good morals [8, 9]. Under the law on contracts, courts will not recognize transactions that are prejudicial to public welfare, sound morality, or civic honesty [9]. A provision intended to "increase the business potential of an educational institution" by restricting a student's freedom to transfer is repugnant to sound morality [8, 9].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and Arellano University is ordered to pay Cui the sum of P1,033.87 with interest [10].
