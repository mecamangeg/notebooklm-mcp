I. CAPTION
INTERNATIONAL OIL FACTORY (CHENG BAN YEK CO., INC.), ET AL. v. THE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH, ET AL., G.R. No. L-13438, May 31, 1961, 2 SCRA 362, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, manufacturers of hydrogenated vegetable lard and oil, sought to prohibit the enforcement of Food and Drugs Act Administrative Decisions Nos. 268 and 269 issued by the Respondent Director of Health. These regulations prohibited an air content of more than 25% in hydrogenated vegetable lard and oil. Respondents argued that aeration exceeding 25% constitutes "adulteration" or "substitution" under Section 1115 of the Revised Administrative Code because it increases the bulk of the product, potentially deceiving consumers who might judge quantity by volume rather than weight. Petitioners contended the regulation was in excess of authority, asserting that air is harmless, does not replace the oil, and that they sell products by net weight printed on containers. The Court of First Instance of Manila declared the regulations null and void. Respondents appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the administrative regulation limiting air content to 25% is valid as a measure against food adulteration or substitution under the Food and Drugs Act.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the regulation was issued in excess of the powers delegated to the Director of Health. The Court ruled that aeration does not constitute "adulteration" under Section 1115(c) of the Revised Administrative Code.
1.  **No Reduction of Quality:** Aeration does not "reduce or lower or injuriously affect" the quality or strength of the lard [1, 2].
2.  **No Substitution:** The Court defined "substitution" as putting something in place of another, implying the removal of the original substance. Air does not displace the lard or oil; the full weight of the product remains because air has no weight. It merely makes the product opaque and bulky [2, 3].
3.  **Deception vs. Adulteration:** Mere increase in bulk is not adulteration. While Section 1115 covers specific forms of deception, deception regarding "quantity" (volume vs. weight) falls under "misbranding" (Section 1116), which is addressed by marking the net weight on the package—a requirement petitioners already complied with [4-6].

Petition granted; decision affirmed.
