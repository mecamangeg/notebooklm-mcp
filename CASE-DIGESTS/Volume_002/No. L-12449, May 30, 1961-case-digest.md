I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ESPIRIDION ALIDO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-12449, May 30, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On May 29, 1955, at around 6:00 P.M. in Maasin, Iloilo, Francisco Hervas was shot and killed at his home. His widow, Concepcion Laserna, and son, Demetrio, saw the assailants. Initially, the widow identified only accused Espiridion Alido and claimed she did not recognize his two companions. Later, she recanted and identified the appellants, Inocencio Hervas and Marcelo Hervas (cousins of the deceased), as the companions, pointing to Inocencio as the shooter. She explained her initial silence was due to fear, as Inocencio was present during her first interrogation and intimidated her. Inocencio had also advised her to claim the death was caused by a bolo wound and facilitated a prompt burial without investigation. Marcelo, a barrio lieutenant, failed to report the crime and feigned absence. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo convicted Inocencio and Marcelo of murder (Alido did not appeal).

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the identification of the accused-appellants as the perpetrators is credible despite the widow's initial inconsistent statement.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the conviction. The witnesses' identification was credible because the Court took **judicial notice** that in May and June, the sun sets after 6:00 P.M., providing sufficient light for the witnesses to recognize the assailants, who were well-known relatives [1-3]. The widow's delay in identifying the appellants was sufficiently explained by her fear of Inocencio, whose intimidating conduct during the investigation was corroborated by the Constabulary investigator [4-6]. Additionally, the appellants' post-crime conduct evidenced a guilty conscience: Inocencio attempted to suppress the truth by advising a false cause of death and rushing the burial [5, 7], while Marcelo evaded authorities and failed to perform his duty as barrio lieutenant to report the crime [8]. The killing was qualified by treachery (*alevosia*) due to the suddenness of the attack [9].

Judgment affirmed.
