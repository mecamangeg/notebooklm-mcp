I. CAPTION
MARCELO SARMIENTO, ET AL. v. PEDRO BELDEROL, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15719, May 31, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
The Municipal Council of Tagbilaran, Bohol, enacted Ordinance No. 12, series of 1956, prohibiting the operation of cockpits within 100 lineal meters of any public building or school [1, 2]. Respondent Inting applied for a permit to operate a cockpit, which was approved by the Mayor (Respondent Belderol) based on a certification that it was 131 meters away from Rafael Palma College [3, 4]. Petitioner Sarmiento, a licensed cockpit operator, protested, claiming Inting’s cockpit was actually less than 100 meters from the school's buildings [5].

Instead of acting on the violation, the Mayor and Council advised Sarmiento to go to court [6, 7]. Following an inquiry from the Office of the President regarding the violation, the Council hastily passed Ordinance No. 2, series of 1958 [7, 8]. This new ordinance amended Ordinance No. 12 by abolishing the distance requirement specifically for cockpits (while retaining limits for other amusement places) and was made retroactive to May 1955 [8, 9]. Sarmiento filed a case for damages and nullity. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, ruling that under Republic Act No. 1224, the Council had the discretion to abolish distance requirements [10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Municipal Council has the authority under RA 1224 to completely abolish the distance requirement for cockpits.
2. W/N Ordinance No. 2, series of 1958, is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Republic Act No. 1224 empowers municipal councils to regulate amusement places by imposing distance limitations. While the law gives the council discretion to determine the appropriate distance for cockpits (unlike the fixed 200 or 50 meters for other establishments), this discretion does not grant the authority to exempt cockpits from observing *any* distance at all [11]. The legislative intent is to regulate, not to dispense with protections for peace and health [12]. The authority to determine the distance does not carry with it the authority to abolish it entirely [11].

2. **NO.** Ordinance No. 2 is null and void for being partial. The circumstances—enacting the ordinance immediately after the Mayor was questioned by the President's office, and making it retroactive—clearly indicated that the measure was intended solely to favor the respondents (Inting, et al.) [13]. Citing *U.S. v. Abendan*, the Court held that an ordinance intended solely to favor a person or group is void [14].

The decision of the lower court is **REVERSED**. Ordinance No. 2, series of 1958, and the permit issued to the respondents are declared null and void [14].
