I. CAPTION
CIPRIANO E. UNSON v. HON. ARSENIO H. LACSON and GENATO COMMERCIAL CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-13798, July 31, 1961, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Cipriano E. Unson sued Mayor Lacson and Genato Commercial Corporation to annul Manila Ordinance No. 3470. This ordinance withdrew a portion of Callejon del Carmen from public use, converted it into patrimonial property, and leased it to Genato Commercial, which constructed a building thereon. Unson, whose building abutted the alley, argued the construction blocked his exit and prejudiced the public. In a prior decision (G.R. No. L-7909), the Supreme Court reversed the lower court and declared the Ordinance and the contract of lease null and void for violating Article 638 of the Civil Code regarding public easements.

However, the dispositive portion of the prior decision did not explicitly order the demolition of the building Genato had erected. When Unson sought execution of the judgment to remove the obstruction, Genato opposed, arguing that the decision did not direct the delivery of the land or the demolition of the structure. Genato also invoked Articles 448, 546, and 548 of the Civil Code, claiming rights as a builder in good faith. The Court of First Instance of Manila issued an order for execution (implying removal). Genato appealed this order.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the judgment declaring the ordinance and lease void includes the removal of the building erected on the leased property, despite the absence of an explicit order for demolition.
2. W/N Genato Commercial Corporation may claim reimbursement or retention as a builder in good faith.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A judgment is not confined to what appears upon the face of the decision, but also encompasses those matters necessarily included therein or necessary thereto. The previous decision declaring the Ordinance and lease null and void necessarily includes the removal of the building. The central issue in the main case was the validity of the ordinance; since it was declared invalid because the building prevented public use of the alley, the building has no reason to continue. To require Unson to institute a separate action for demolition would be a cumbersome process (*Marcelo v. Mencias*).

2. **NO.** Genato cannot invoke Articles 448, 546, and 548 of the Civil Code. Article 448 refers to the "owner of the land," but Unson is not the owner; the City of Manila is, and the City did not appeal. Articles 546 and 548 regarding necessary expenses and retention would only apply if Unson had been awarded possession, which was not the case as the property was restored for public use. Furthermore, Genato failed to raise the claim of being a builder in good faith in the original complaint, having relied solely on the validity of the ordinance.

**Order affirmed.**
