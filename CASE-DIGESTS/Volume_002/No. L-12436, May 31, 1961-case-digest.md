I. CAPTION
LA CARLOTA SUGAR CENTRAL and ELIZALDE & CO., INC. v. PEDRO JIMENEZ, AUDITOR GENERAL OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-12436, May 31, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In September 1955, petitioner La Carlota Sugar Central ("Central"), managed by co-petitioner Elizalde & Co., Inc. ("Elizalde"), imported 850 short tons of fertilizers. The letter of credit, invoices, and bills of lading were all in the name of the Central [1]. Upon arrival, the Central Bank imposed a 17% exchange tax amounting to P20,872.09, which the Central paid [2].

The Central filed for a refund, arguing the fertilizers were imported for the exclusive use of five haciendas owned or managed by Elizalde. They claimed exemption under Section 2 of Republic Act No. 601, as amended, which exempts fertilizers imported by planters or farmers [2]. The Auditor of the Central Bank denied the refund. On appeal, the Auditor General affirmed the denial, ruling that the importation did not fall within the scope of the exempting provisions [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the importation of fertilizers by the Central, acting as an agent for planters, is exempt from the 17% exchange tax under Republic Act No. 601.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the Auditor General's decision. Section 2 of Republic Act No. 601 exempts fertilizers only "when imported by planters or farmers directly or through their cooperatives" [4, 5]. The Court held that the word "directly" means "without anything intervening" or "without intervening agency or person" [6]. Consequently, importation through an agent other than a cooperative is not done "directly" [6].

The Central admitted it was not the planter ultimately benefited, nor was it a cooperative [5]. Although the Central argued it acted merely as an agent to accommodate the haciendas, the law explicitly designates "cooperatives" as the only recognized agent for the exemption [6, 7]. Furthermore, statutory provisions governing tax exemptions and refunds are construed strictly against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority [8]. The petition was denied, and the ruling of the Auditor General was affirmed [9].
