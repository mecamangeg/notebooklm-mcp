I. CAPTION
ERMIDIA A. MARIANO v. THE ROYAL INTEROCEAN LINES (Keninkijke Java-China-Fakitvaart Lijnen N. V. Amsterdam) and J. V. KAMERLING, G.R. No. L-12429, July 21, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellee Mariano filed a Motion for Reconsideration contending that the "Local Staff Allowances" regulations of the appellant company formed part of her employment contract, entitling her to retirement and old age benefits [1]. Previously, the trial court had denied this specific claim, ruling that Mariano failed to comply with the condition of completing ten successive years in permanent service from March 1, 1948, to August 21, 1955 [1]. Mariano attempted to appeal this adverse finding but failed because her record on appeal was filed beyond the reglementary period [1]. She subsequently filed two petitions for mandamus (G.R. Nos. L-12557 and L-13160) to compel the trial court to allow the appeal, but the Supreme Court dismissed both for lack of merit [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiff-appellee can claim retirement and old age allowances despite the trial court's prior rejection of said claim.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the trial court's judgment denying the claim for retirement and old age allowances is final and executory insofar as the appellee is concerned [1]. Because Mariano failed to file her appeal within the reglementary period and her subsequent petitions for mandamus were dismissed, the trial court's finding that she did not meet the ten-year service requirement is *res judicata* [1, 2]. Consequently, she is barred from raising this issue again, and the Court cannot adopt her view regarding the nature of the allowances in the contract [1]. The Motion for Reconsideration is denied [2].
