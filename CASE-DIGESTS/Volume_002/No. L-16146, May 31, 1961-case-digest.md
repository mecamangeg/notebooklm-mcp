I. CAPTION
THE ACTING DIRECTOR, NATIONAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, for and in behalf of the REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. THE HON. HERMOGENES CALUAG, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Branch IV—Quezon City), SIXTO MAGDALUYO, CARLOS MAGDALUYO and RODOLFO TAYLAN, G.R. No. L-16146, May 31, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On June 3, 1959, following the Supreme Court decision in *Philipps v. Municipal Mayor of Caloocan* declaring jackpot slot machines as illegal gambling devices, agents of the Petitioner Acting Director of the NBI seized 68 slot machines in Pasay City under search warrants issued by Respondent Judge Caluag. Criminal cases were filed against owners of 17 machines, but no charges were filed regarding the remaining 51 machines owned by private respondents Sixto Magdaluyo and Rodolfo Taylan, as these were covered by licenses under a Pasay City ordinance.

The private respondents moved for the return of the 51 machines. Petitioner opposed, invoking the "Theory of Preventive Justice" to prevent their use in crimes. On September 19, 1959, Judge Caluag ordered the return of the machines. Petitioner appealed this order, but the Judge dismissed the appeal on October 19, 1959, ruling that the order was merely interlocutory and unappealable. Subsequently, the Judge threatened to hold Petitioner in contempt for failure to return the machines. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the NBI Director has the legal personality to appeal the lower court's order.
2. W/N the order dated September 19, 1959, directing the return of the seized properties, is final and appealable.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** As a law enforcement agent with the duty to execute the law, the Petitioner has sufficient personality to assail the order directing the return of the seized slot machines and the order dismissing his appeal. This is particularly true where the court threatened to punish him for contempt. The Court likened the Petitioner to judicial administrators and receivers who, as officers of the court holding property in custody, have the right to appeal final orders affecting such custody that they consider erroneous [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The order of September 19, 1959, is a final order, not interlocutory. An order is final and appealable if it settles definitely the matter therein disposed of, and no further proceeding would ensue thereafter in connection therewith. Since there was no pending criminal case involving these specific slot machines, no further proceedings would follow the order of return. Had the Petitioner not appealed, the order would have become executory, a status which negates its alleged interlocutory character [3].

Petition GRANTED. The orders dismissing the appeal are set aside, and the Respondent Judge is directed to give due course to the Petitioner's appeal. The preliminary injunction is made permanent.
