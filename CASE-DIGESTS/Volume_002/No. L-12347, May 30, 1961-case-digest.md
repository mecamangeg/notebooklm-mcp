I. CAPTION
HERCULANO GRAPILON v. MUNICIPAL COUNCIL OF CARIGARA, LEYTE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-12347, May 30, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In the 1955 elections, Jose Aguilar and petitioner Herculano Grapilon were elected Mayor and Vice-Mayor, respectively, of Carigara, Leyte [1]. On March 6, 1957, Mayor Aguilar left for Manila on official business pursuant to a municipal council resolution [1]. Upon verifying the Mayor's departure, Grapilon informed the Municipal Secretary, Chief of Police, and Provincial Governor that he was assuming office as Acting Mayor under Section 2195 of the Revised Administrative Code [1]. The officials refused to recognize him, citing the Governor's advice that a Mayor's absence for official business does not create a vacancy for the Vice-Mayor to fill [2].

Grapilon filed a petition for Mandamus with the Court of First Instance of Leyte to compel the respondents to recognize his authority and to pay damages [2]. The lower court ruled in favor of Grapilon, declaring he was entitled to assume the office in the Mayor's absence [3]. The respondents appealed, arguing that "absence" under the law refers to disability, which does not apply when the Mayor is on official business [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Vice-Mayor may assume the powers of the Mayor when the latter is away on official business.
2. W/N the respondents are entitled to damages on their counterclaim.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the "absence" contemplated in Section 2195 of the Revised Administrative Code must be construed as "effective" absence or temporary disability, similar to "suspension" which disables an official from exercising their prerogatives [6]. When a Mayor is in Manila on official business, he is not disabled but is actually performing the duties of his office and exercising its powers, merely physically distant from the municipality [6], [7]. Furthermore, there was no emergency or occasion demanding the immediate exercise of executive powers for the preservation of public order that would necessitate replacing the absent official [8].

2. **NO.** Damages may not be awarded because there was no showing that Grapilon acted maliciously or in bad faith in filing the suit for Mandamus to assert what he believed were his rights, nor was there sufficient evidence to prove the damages claimed by the respondents [9], [10].

The decision of the lower court is **REVERSED** insofar as it granted the writ of Mandamus, and **AFFIRMED** insofar as it dismissed the respondents' counterclaim [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
