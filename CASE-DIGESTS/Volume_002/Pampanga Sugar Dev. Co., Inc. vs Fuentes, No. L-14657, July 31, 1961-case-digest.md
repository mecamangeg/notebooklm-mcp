I. CAPTION
PABLO FELICIANO v. HON. LADISLAO PASICOLAN and UNION C. KAYANAN, G.R. No. L-14657, July 31, 1961, Natividad, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pablo Feliciano was charged, along with 17 others, with kidnapping with murder in an amended information filed in Criminal Case No. 1984, *People v. Carlos Pabustan, et al.* Upon learning that a warrant for his arrest had been issued, Feliciano went into hiding and remained at large. Without surrendering to the authorities, he filed a motion asking the Court of First Instance of Pampanga (presided by Respondent Judge Pasicolan) to fix his bail at P10,000.00. The Respondent Judge refused to decide the motion on the merits. Feliciano filed a petition for *mandamus* with the Supreme Court, arguing that under the Constitution, all persons are bailable before conviction, and the Judge failed to perform a duty imposed by law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a person who is at large and not in the custody of the law is entitled to apply for admission to bail.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the constitutional mandate that all persons shall be bailable before conviction is subject to the limitation that the person applying for bail must be in the custody of the law or otherwise deprived of their liberty.

The Court cited Rule 110, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, which defines bail as security "required and given for the release of a person who is in custody of the law." Citing *Manigbas v. Luna*, the Court reasoned that the purpose of bail is to secure one's release, and it would be incongruous to grant bail to one who is free. While *Herras Teehankee v. Rovira* established that one need not wait for a formal complaint to seek bail, the right only accrues when a person is arrested or restrained. Since Feliciano was a free man at large when he filed the motion, he was not entitled to admission to bail.

Petition for *mandamus* is **DISMISSED**.
