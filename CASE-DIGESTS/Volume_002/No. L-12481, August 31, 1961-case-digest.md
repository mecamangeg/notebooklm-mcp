I. CAPTION
CO TUAN, petitioner, vs. THE CITY OF MANILA, respondent, G.R. No. L-12481, August 31, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Co Tuan owned a soap factory on Caballeros St., Manila, for which he paid a manufacturer’s license, and a separate store on M. de Santos St. regarding which he paid a retail license. City inspectors discovered invoices at the store covering wholesale transactions. Consequently, the City assessed Co Tuan a wholesale dealer’s tax of P2,582.90. Co Tuan paid under protest and filed a suit for refund, arguing that the wholesale sales were consummated at the factory and thus covered by his manufacturer’s tax. He claimed the invoices were merely kept at the store for lack of space. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Co Tuan, ordering a refund. The Court of Appeals reversed the decision but forwarded the records to the Supreme Court as the case involved the validity of a tax assessment.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a manufacturer selling products at a separate store is liable for the wholesale dealer’s tax.
2. W/N the petitioner is exempt from the dealer's tax under Section 18(o) of the Revised Charter of the City of Manila.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A manufacturer becomes a dealer if it carries on the business of selling its manufactured products at a store or warehouse apart from its place of manufacture. The Court applied the doctrine in *Cebu Portland Cement Co. v. City of Manila* and *Central Azucarera Don Pedro v. City of Manila*. Evidence showed that the invoices found at the store bore the store's address and lacked the "Factory Sales" stamp found on factory invoices, proving that wholesale transactions occurred at the separate store. Under Section 585 of the Revised Ordinances of the City of Manila, a separate license is required for each business conducted in a different place.

2. **NO.** The exemption provided in Section 18(o) of Republic Act No. 409 (Revised Charter of the City of Manila) refers only to dealers who are previously taxed *as such dealers* under other provisions of Section 18 (e.g., junk dealers), and not to manufacturers taxed under Section 18(m).

The judgment of the Court of First Instance was reversed, and the complaint was dismissed.
