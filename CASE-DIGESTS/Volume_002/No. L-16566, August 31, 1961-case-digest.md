I. CAPTION
JOSE I. LIM, petitioner, vs. HON. ENRIQUE MAGLANOC and PEDRO FRANCIA, respondents., G.R. No. L-16566, August 31, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jose I. Lim and respondent Pedro Francia were candidates for Mayor in Agdangan, Quezon during the November 10, 1959 elections. Discrepancies arose in the election returns of three precincts:
1.  **Precinct No. 1**: Lim’s votes appeared as "one hundred seven" in words but "117" in figures.
2.  **Precinct No. 3**: The written votes for Francia were alleged to be illegible.
3.  **Precinct No. 6**: Francia’s votes appeared as "seventy-nine" in words but "19" in figures.

Lim filed a petition for recount with the Court of First Instance of Quezon (presided by Judge Maglanoc). The Judge ordered a recount but directed that it be based on the corresponding tally sheets rather than the ballots themselves. Lim moved for reconsideration, insisting on reading the ballots, which was denied. He filed this petition for Certiorari, arguing the court acted with grave abuse of discretion. Respondent Francia argued that under Sections 163 and 168 of the Revised Election Code, a recount is only proper for discrepancies between different authentic copies of returns, not discrepancies within the same return (words vs. figures), and that words should prevail over figures.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the discrepancies in the election returns for Precincts 1, 3, and 6 warrant a judicial recount of the ballots.

IV. RULING
**YES, but only for Precinct No. 1.**

**Precinct No. 1:** The Court held that the discrepancy between the words ("one hundred seven") and figures ("117") in the return was substantial because it affected the result of the election. If Lim received 117 votes, the result would be a tie; if 107, Francia would win by 10 votes. To determine the true result, the Court ordered a recount of the ballots, modifying the lower court's order which relied only on tally sheets.

**Precinct No. 3:** **NO.** The Provincial Treasurer certified that the election return copies were "clear and legible," showing Francia obtained "one hundred twenty-seven" (127) and Lim "seventy" (70). The alleged illegibility was merely a difficulty encountered by board members in reading the text. Since the Treasurer attested the returns were clear, opening the ballot boxes was deemed unnecessary and dangerous [1].

**Precinct No. 6:** **NO.** The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) certified that there was no discrepancy in the returns, which clearly showed "seventy-nine" (79) for Francia and "one hundred fifteen" (115) for Lim. Given the clear certification by the constitutional body charged with supervising elections, further judicial intervention was unnecessary [2].

**Petition granted.** The order of the respondent court is modified, directing said court to recount the ballots cast in Precinct No. 1 only.
