I. CAPTION
EULOGIO RODRIGUEZ, SR. v. SOFRONIO FRANCISCO, G.R. No. L-12039, June 30, 1961, 2 SCRA 648, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Exequiel Ampil was the registered owner of a parcel of land under Original Certificate of Title No. 2497 [1]. On March 24, 1924, Ampil sold the land to Maximo Francisco for P1,500.00 via a deed of sale. Maximo took possession and paid taxes, but the deed was not registered, and the title remained in Ampil’s name [1].

On October 21, 1933, Ampil, being indebted to various creditors with plaintiff Eulogio Rodriguez, Sr. as guarantor, executed a "Venta Condicional" in favor of Rodriguez [2]. The deed, registered on November 15, 1933, provided that if Rodriguez paid Ampil's debts due to the latter's failure to pay, the sale would automatically become absolute [3]. Rodriguez eventually paid the debts. On December 10, 1936, Rodriguez filed an affidavit consolidating ownership, leading to the cancellation of Ampil's title and the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 31204 in Rodriguez’s name [4].

Defendant Sofronio Francisco (representing Maximo Francisco) claimed ownership based on the 1924 sale and adverse possession. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Rodriguez [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the "Venta Condicional" was an equitable mortgage or a valid conditional sale.
2. W/N the 1924 unregistered sale to Maximo Francisco prevails over the 1933 registered sale to Rodriguez.
3. W/N the defendant acquired the land by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The contract was a conditional sale, not an equitable mortgage. The Court held that the "Venta Condicional" did not merely provide security—the manifest purpose of a mortgage—but conditionally transferred ownership to the vendee [6]. This ownership became absolute and final automatically upon the fulfillment of the condition (payment of debts by the vendee), without need for a new deed of conveyance [3]. The Court found the contract to be a perfected sale subject to a resolutory condition authorized by the Civil Code and not a prohibited *pactum commissorium* [6, 7].

2. **NO.** The 1924 deed of sale in favor of Maximo Francisco was without legal effect as against third persons because it was not registered. The land was under the Torrens system, and Rodriguez duly registered his "Venta Condicional" on November 15, 1933 [7].

3. **NO.** The Court rejected the claim of ownership via prescription. Under Section 46 of Act 496, no title to registered land may be acquired by prescription or adverse possession [8].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [9].
