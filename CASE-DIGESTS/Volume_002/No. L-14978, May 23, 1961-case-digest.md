I. CAPTION
Bantoto Coo v. Republic, G.R. No. L-14978, May 23, 1961, Natividad, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Lily, William, Sober, Manuel, Mercy, Alven, Eve, and Joy, all surnamed Bantoto Coo, are the minor children of Coo Ak (a Chinese citizen) and Bernardina Bantoto (a Filipina). Although the petitioners were born out of wedlock to single parents in Negros Oriental, their birth certificates contained errors regarding their civil status and citizenship, as well as the civil status of their parents [1, 2]. Some entries listed them as "legitimate" or "Chinese," and their parents as "married" [3]. Petitioners filed a proceeding to correct these entries. The Republic opposed the petition, arguing that the alleged errors were not clerical but substantial, affecting civil status and citizenship, and thus could not be corrected in the instant proceeding. The trial court granted the petition. The Republic appealed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N corrections involving civil status and citizenship can be made under the summary proceeding provided in Article 412 of the New Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the trial court's order. The Court held that the proceeding contemplated in Article 412 of the New Civil Code is summary in nature and merely embraces corrections of mistakes that are clerical in nature, such as clearly misspelled names or the occupation of parents [5, 6]. It does not cover controversial issues that may affect the civil status, nationality, or citizenship of a person [5]. Citing *Ty Kong Tin v. Republic* and *Ansaldo v. Republic*, the Court emphasized that substantial changes affecting status or citizenship are grave matters that must be "threshed out in appropriate actions" where all affected parties are impleaded and evidence is submitted to ensure due process [7, 8]. Since the petitioners sought corrections regarding their legitimacy and citizenship, these were controversial matters outside the scope of a summary proceeding [9]. The petition was dismissed [10].
