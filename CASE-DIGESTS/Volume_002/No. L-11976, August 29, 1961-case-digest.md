**I. CAPTION**
COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. ANTONIO PRIETO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-11976, August 29, 1961, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Doña Teresa Tuazon y de la Paz died leaving a will that directed her estate be divided equally among her 14 heirs, including respondents Antonio, Benito, and Mauro Prieto. Because the estate's real properties could not be physically divided equally, the respondents were allotted properties with values higher than their proportionate shares. To equalize the shares as agreed, the respondents paid cash reimbursements to their co-heirs.

The Collector of Internal Revenue assessed inheritance taxes based on the full value of the properties allotted to the respondents, without deducting the cash payments they made to the other heirs. The respondents paid the taxes in installments, with the final payments made on March 11, 1953 (Antonio) and December 9, 1954 (Benito and Mauro). On January 12, 1955, they filed a claim for refund, arguing they overpaid because the cash reimbursements should have been deducted from their taxable inheritance. The Collector denied the claim. On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ordered the refund with interest. The Collector appealed to the Supreme Court, raising issues on non-joinder of parties, the computation of the tax, liability for interest, and prescription.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the executrix and other heirs are indispensable parties to the claim for refund.
2. W/N the cash payments made by respondents to their co-heirs should be deducted from the value of their inheritance for tax purposes.
3. W/N the claim for refund has prescribed.
4. W/N the Collector of Internal Revenue is liable for interest on the refunded taxes.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The executrix and other heirs are not indispensable parties. The respondents merely asked for the refund of the inheritance taxes they specifically paid. The Court of Tax Appeals could render a final determination on the respondents' tax liability without affecting the other heirs or the estate [1].

2. **YES.** Inheritance tax is paid on the basis of the value of the properties actually inherited by an heir. In reality, the share received by each respondent was the value of the allotted property *minus* the cash paid to co-heirs to equalize the partition. To claim otherwise would ignore the realities of the case. Thus, the cash payments must be deducted to determine the just and fair basis of the tax liability [2].

3. **NO.** The claim was filed within the prescriptive period. When a tax is paid in installments, the two-year prescriptive period provided in Section 306 of the National Internal Revenue Code is counted from the date of the **final payment**. Since the last installments were paid in March 1953 and December 1954, the claim filed on January 12, 1955, was well within the period [3], [4].

4. **YES.** Under the Internal Revenue Code, the Collector may be made to answer for interest at the legal rate on taxes improperly collected. This liability serves as a safeguard against arbitrariness in tax exaction (*Carcar Electric & Ice Plant Co., Inc. v. Collector of Internal Revenue*) [5].

**Decision affirmed.**
