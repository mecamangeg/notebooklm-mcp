I. CAPTION
VICENTE TAN v. MARCELINO SARMIENTO, in his capacity as City Treasurer of Manila, G.R. No. L-13407, May 24, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Vicente Tan, a Chinese citizen, filed a petition for mandamus to compel the City Treasurer of Manila to renew his license to engage in the retail business [1, 2]. The City Treasurer refused to renew the license for the year 1956, arguing that under Republic Act No. 1180 (Retail Trade Nationalization Law), Tan was disqualified because he was not a Filipino citizen and was not "actually engaged in the retail business on May 15, 1954" [3]. Tan admitted he only obtained his license to operate on May 22, 1954, but argued that he should be entitled to the exception, citing the case of *Kwan Kwai v. Perdices* where a license issued after the deadline was recognized [4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the petition, finding Tan was not actually engaged in business on the cut-off date [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is entitled to the exception under Republic Act No. 1180 allowing aliens to engage in retail trade.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. Section 1 of R.A. 1180 prohibits aliens from engaging in retail trade, with the specific exception of those "actually engaged in the retail business on May 15, 1954" [6]. The Court ruled that Tan did not fall under this exception because he was not actually engaged in the business on said date; his license was only issued on May 22, 1954 [7]. The Court distinguished this from *Kwan Kwai v. Perdices*, where the alien was actually engaged in business prior to May 15, 1954 and had paid taxes covering that period [7]. The initial issuance of a license to Tan on May 22 was a mistake by the Treasurer and did not grant Tan a vested right to its renewal [7].

Decision affirmed.
