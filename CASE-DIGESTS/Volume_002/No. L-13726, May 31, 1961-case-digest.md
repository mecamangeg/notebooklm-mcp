I. CAPTION
LORENZO E. MACANSANTOS and TOMAS E. MACANSANTOS v. HON. WENCESLAO L. FERNAN, TEOFILA DE GUINOO and VICENTE GUINOO, G.R. No. L-13726, May 31, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
In a previous case (G.R. No. L-5541), the Supreme Court rendered a final decision ordering respondent Teofila de Guinoo to "reconvey only one-half of Lot 127-A" to petitioners Lorenzo and Tomas Macansantos. The decision made no pronouncement regarding improvements on the land or the return of the purchase price [1]. During the execution of the judgment, the respondents (Guinoos) insisted that the deed of reconveyance include a consideration of P400.00 and exclude improvements, while the petitioners objected, arguing the deed should state no consideration but expressly include the improvements [2]. Respondent Judge Fernan issued orders directing that the reconveyance be strictly in accordance with the Supreme Court decision—"sans consideration and improvements"—and ruled that claims regarding money and improvements be settled in a separate proceeding [3]. Petitioners filed a petition for mandamus to compel the judge to order the execution of the deed including all improvements and to issue a writ of possession [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may modify the writ of execution to include improvements or consideration when the final appellate decision was silent on these matters.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court has no power to change, amplify, enlarge, alter, or modify the decision of an appellate court which has become final and executory [5]. The previous judgment was simple and plain: it sentenced the respondent to reconvey one-half of the lot, without mentioning improvements or the restoration of consideration [5]. The insertion of a consideration (as desired by respondents) or the inclusion of improvements (as desired by petitioners) in the deed of reconveyance would constitute an impermissible alteration of the final decision [5, 6].

Petition **DENIED** [7].
