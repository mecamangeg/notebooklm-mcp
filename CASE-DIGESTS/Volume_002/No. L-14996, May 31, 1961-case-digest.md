I. CAPTION
XERXES C. GARCIA v. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, G.R. No. L-14996, May 31, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On January 5, 1945, during the Japanese Occupation, Xerxes C. Garcia purchased a cashier’s check (demand draft) for P20,000.00 in Japanese military notes from the Philippine National Bank (PNB) agency in San Fernando, Pampanga. The check was payable on demand. Garcia presented the check for payment to PNB only on November 15, 1954, long after the Liberation. PNB refused payment, citing Executive Order No. 49, which declared deposits and liabilities incurred during the occupation as null and void.

Garcia filed a suit for recovery of the amount. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that PNB was no longer under obligation to honor the check because the Japanese war notes were no longer legal tender. Garcia appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N PNB is liable to pay the cashier's check issued in Japanese war notes but presented for payment after Liberation.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision but adjusted the amount payable.

The Court ruled that a check or obligation that matured during the Japanese occupation—when Japanese military notes were valid—but is presented for payment after Liberation—when said notes were no longer lawful—must be paid or discharged according to the **Ballantyne Schedule of Values**.

Applying the schedule for January 1945, where P120.00 in Japanese notes was equivalent to P1.00 in Philippine currency, the P20,000.00 check is equivalent to only P166.67.

**Disposition:** The judgment is reversed, and PNB is ordered to pay Garcia the sum of P166.67, Philippine currency, with lawful interest from May 22, 1958, until paid.
