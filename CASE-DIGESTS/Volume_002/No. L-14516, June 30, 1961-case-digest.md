I. CAPTION
VICTOR DE LOS REYES v. PIO PASTORFIDE, G.R. No. L-14516, June 30, 1961, 2 SCRA 706, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellee Victor de los Reyes is the registered owner of Lot No. 52 in Basilan City, covered by TCT No. 38 (T-1459). The lot was originally covered by OCT No. 330 issued to a homestead patentee in 1922. Defendant-appellant Pio Pastorfide occupied a portion of said lot. Pastorfide claimed ownership, alleging he purchased the land from the government through a sales application in 1935 and had been in continuous possession since 1927. The Bureau of Lands had awarded the land to Pastorfide in 1935 but later cancelled the sale upon discovering the land was already private property.

De los Reyes filed a complaint for recovery of possession and damages. The Court of First Instance of Basilan ruled in favor of De los Reyes, ordering Pastorfide to vacate the premises and pay back rentals, resurvey fees, and attorney's fees. Pastorfide appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Pastorfide acquired ownership of the land through the 1935 government sale or by prescription.
2. W/N Pastorfide is liable for back rentals.
3. W/N Pastorfide is liable for the resurvey fee and attorney's fees.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The 1935 sale conferred no right to Pastorfide because the land had already been adjudicated to a patentee in 1922 and covered by an Original Certificate of Title. Once titled, the land became private property and was released from the control and supervision of the Director of Lands; thus, it could no longer be the subject of another adjudication [1]. Furthermore, under Section 46 of Act 496 (Land Registration Act), lands brought under the operation of the Torrens system cannot be acquired by prescription or adverse possession [2].

2. **YES.** The owner, having been unjustly deprived of the use of his property, is entitled to reasonable rent for its occupancy and utilization. The Court affirmed the award of back rentals [2].

3. **NO.** The Court deleted the awards for resurvey fees and attorney's fees. The resurvey fee was an expenditure incurred by the plaintiff to determine the exact boundaries of his own property and was not included in the complaint, making it unfair to charge the defendant [3]. Attorney's fees were improper because the defendant's refusal to vacate was motivated by an honest belief that he had a valid cause under the law based on his sales application, rather than bad faith [3].

Decision MODIFIED; the award for resurvey fees and attorney's fees is eliminated, but the judgment is otherwise affirmed.
