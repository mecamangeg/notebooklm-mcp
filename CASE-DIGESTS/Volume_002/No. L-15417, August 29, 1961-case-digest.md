I. CAPTION
FELIX MONTE v. SANTIAGO G. ORTEGA and AUGUSTO S. CACERES, G.R. No. L-15417, August 29, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On April 16, 1955, Felix Monte filed a complaint for Replevin with Damages against defendants Santiago Ortega (Mayor) and Augusto Caceres (Chief of Police) of Iriga, Camarines Sur, for impounding his two cargo trucks [1]. The defendants alleged the trucks were seized because Monte was extracting materials from Waras River without a license, in violation of the Administrative Code [2]. On December 12, 1955, Monte filed a motion to admit an Amended Complaint including Provincial Fiscal Manuel Estipona as a defendant. Monte alleged that the original defendants induced the Fiscal to file a criminal information against him to escape liability, constituting malicious prosecution, and noted that the criminal case had already been dismissed [3]. The lower court denied the admission of the amended complaint, ruling that it introduced a new cause of action which was not shown to be existing at the time of the filing of the original complaint [4]. Monte appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court erred in refusing to admit the Amended Complaint.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the lower court erred in refusing to admit the amended complaint [5]. The Court relied on **Sec. 2, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court**, stating that the rule authorizes amendments so that "all matters in the action in dispute between the parties may, as far as possible, be completely determined in a single proceeding" [5, 6]. The Court found an intimate relation between the two causes of action: the first alleged illegal impounding, while the second averred that the impounding was sought to be justified by malicious prosecution induced by the respondents [5]. These related matters should be resolved in a single proceeding [5].

Accordingly, the orders were reversed and the case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [7].
