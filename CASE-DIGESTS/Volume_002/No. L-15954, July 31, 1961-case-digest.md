I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BENITO DE LA CRUZ Y REYES and THE ASSOCIATED INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-15954, July 31, 1961, 2 SCRA 952, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Benito de la Cruz was charged with theft in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. Associated Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. posted a P4,000.00 bail bond for his provisional liberty [1]. De la Cruz failed to appear for trial on December 10, 1957, leading the CFI to confiscate the bond on December 12 and enter judgment against the bondsman on January 16, 1958 [1, 2]. The bondsman’s initial motions were denied. On May 7, 1958—six months after the judgment on the bond—the bondsman apprehended De la Cruz and surrendered him to the court [3]. The bondsman moved to set aside the writ of execution and cancel the bond, arguing that the surrender of the accused warranted complete exoneration. The trial court denied the motion, prompting this appeal [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the bondsman is entitled to total exoneration after surrendering the accused six months after the judgment on the bond.

IV. RULING
**NO.** A bondsman is entitled to total exoneration only if, within 30 days after the order of confiscation, it: (1) produces the body of the principal or gives a reason for non-production; and (2) explains satisfactorily why the principal did not appear when first required (Sec. 15, Rule 110, Rules of Court) [5]. The bondsman failed these conditions; it did not produce the accused within the 30-day period, and the trial court found its explanation for the accused's non-appearance (illness) unsatisfactory, noting the accused's history of evading court [5].

However, the Court **GRANTED** a reduction of liability. Considering the bondsman eventually arrested and surrendered the accused after exerting efforts and incurring expenses, and noting the Solicitor General's recommendation for partial remission, the Court deemed it fair to mitigate the liability [6].

Decision modified; the bondsman's liability is reduced from P4,000.00 to P2,000.00 [6, 7].
