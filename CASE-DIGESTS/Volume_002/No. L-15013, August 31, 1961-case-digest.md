I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. ASTURIAS SUGAR CENTRAL, INC., G.R. No. L-15013, August 31, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Asturias Sugar Central, Inc. owned a mill in Capiz that was destroyed on April 18, 1942, by the USAFFE to resist enemy attack. In 1948, Asturias filed a claim for damages with the Philippine War Damage Commission. It received payments in February and November 1950, at which point it was informed no further funds were available. Consequently, in its 1950 income tax return, Asturias deducted the uncompensated portion of its war losses. Petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) disallowed the deduction, contending that the loss should have been deducted in 1942 when it was actually sustained, not in 1950. The CIR assessed deficiency taxes, which Asturias paid and then claimed for refund. The Court of Tax Appeals ruled in favor of Asturias, ordering the refund.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the war losses sustained in 1942 were properly deductible in 1950 when the amount of indemnity was finally determined.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals. Under Section 30(d)(2) of the Tax Code, losses are deductible if "actually sustained... and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise." Furthermore, Sections 94 and 96 of Revenue Regulations No. 2 provide that losses must be evidenced by "closed and completed transactions," and if a claim for indemnity exists, the loss is deductible in the year the claim is finally determined.

The Court held that the destruction of the central on April 18, 1942, was covered by "insurance" under Section 5g of Public Law 506 (War Damage Corporation Act). This law provided compensation for losses occurring between December 6, 1941, and July 1, 1942, "as if a policy... was in fact in force," thereby establishing a relationship identical to insurance by operation of law. Asturias, therefore, had the duty to wait until the amount of compensation was determined before claiming the deduction. The Court distinguished this from *Cu Unjieng v. Collector*, where the losses occurred in 1945 and were not covered by the Act, making them deductible in the year sustained.

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
