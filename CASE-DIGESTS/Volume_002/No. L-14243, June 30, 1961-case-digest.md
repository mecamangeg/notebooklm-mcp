I. CAPTION
JOSE L. UY v. OSCAR L. UY, G.R. No. L-14243, June 30, 1961, Natividad, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Jose L. Uy sold his share of a co-owned hacienda to his brother, defendant Oscar L. Uy, for P100,000.00. After Oscar allegedly failed to pay the full balance, Jose filed a complaint against Oscar, the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, and the Register of Deeds to recover P40,000.00 with 6% interest. Oscar filed an answer claiming he had overpaid. Subsequently, Jose moved to file an amended complaint to remove the other defendants and incorporate a deed titled "Amendment of Terms," which stipulated a 12% interest rate. Oscar opposed this, arguing it was improper after his answer was filed. The trial court admitted the amended complaint and later rendered judgment for Jose based on a commissioner's report calculated at the 12% rate found in the amended complaint. Oscar appealed, challenging the admission of the amendment.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court properly admitted the amended complaint after the filing of a responsive pleading.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the admission of the amended complaint was not an abuse of discretion. Under **Rule 17, Sections 1 and 2 of the Rules of Court**, courts have broad discretion to allow amendments to pleadings after the filing of responsive pleadings at any stage of the action before final judgment. The only limitations are that the amendment must not substantially change the cause of action, alter the theory of the case, or be made to delay the action.

Here, the amendment was not made to delay; it merely supplemented an incomplete allegation, eliminated parties, and incorporated a new document. The nature of the action (recovery of a sum of money) and its theory (that the sum was due under a valid obligation) were not changed or altered. Since the amendment was proper, the trial court correctly based its judgment on the figures derived from the "Amendment of Terms" contract.

**Judgment affirmed.**
