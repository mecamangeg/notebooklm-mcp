I. CAPTION
CIPRIANO B. MOTOS v. ROBERTO SOLER ET AL., G.R. No. L-11329, May 31, 1961, 2 SCRA 293, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellant Cipriano B. Motos filed an action to compel defendants-appellees Roberto Soler et al. to allow him to repurchase a specific property [1]. In their answer, Soler et al. denied Motos' right to repurchase under the Public Land Act and raised the defense of prescription [1]. The Supreme Court subsequently rendered a decision granting Motos the right to repurchase the property for the sum of P119.92 [2].

Following this decision, Soler et al. filed a motion to modify the dispositive portion of the judgment [2]. They requested that the case be remanded to the lower court to allow them to present evidence on the value of improvements they had introduced on the property since acquiring it in 1955, arguing they were entitled to reimbursement as possessors in good faith [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appellees' claim for the value of improvements is barred by their failure to plead it in the lower court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the claim for the value of improvements constitutes a compulsory counterclaim [1, 3]. The Court reasoned that the value of whatever improvements may have been introduced by the appellees during their possession should have been litigated in the lower court by setting up the corresponding counterclaim in their answer [1].

Citing established jurisprudence in *Berses v. Villanueva*, *Beltran v. Valbuena*, and *Pascual v. Lesaca*, the Court ruled that the appellees’ failure to plead this counterclaim in the proceedings below bars them from raising the claim at this stage [1]. Consequently, the request to remand the case for the purpose of proving the value of improvements was rejected.

Appellees’ motion for the modification of the dispositive part of the decision is DENIED [4].
