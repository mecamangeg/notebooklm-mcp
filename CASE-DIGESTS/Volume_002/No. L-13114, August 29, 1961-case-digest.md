I. CAPTION
ELENITA LEDESMA SILVA, ET AL. v. ESTHER PERALTA, G.R. No. L-13114, August 29, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Appellant Saturnino Silva deceived appellee Esther Peralta into living with him as his wife, concealing his prior undissolved marriage to an Australian woman. They had a child whom Saturnino later abandoned. Saturnino subsequently married appellant Elenita Ledesma in the United States. Esther, believing in good faith that she was the lawful wife, represented herself as "Mrs. Esther Silva." She filed a case for the child's support, which was dismissed because the child had not been legally recognized. Esther quit her job to prosecute the case. In a previous decision (Nov. 25, 1960), the Supreme Court enjoined Esther from using the surname "Silva" but awarded her pecuniary damages against Saturnino for the child's maintenance and her lost earnings. Appellants filed this Motion for Reconsideration, where Elenita claims moral damages for Esther's unauthorized use of the marital name, and Saturnino argues that the dismissal of the support case constitutes *res judicata* barring the damages award.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Elenita Silva is entitled to moral damages for Esther Peralta's use of the designation "Mrs. Silva."
2. W/N the award of pecuniary damages against Saturnino Silva (for child maintenance and lost earnings) is proper despite the dismissal of the separate support case.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court found that Esther Peralta employed the designation "Mrs. Silva" in good faith, having been led by Saturnino to believe she was his lawful wife. While she was legally forbidden from using the title due to Saturnino's valid marriage to Elenita, an award of moral damages requires a finding of bad faith or culpable negligence in the assumption of the disputed status. No such bad faith existed as Esther was unaware of Saturnino's marriage to Elenita before the institution of the case.

2. **YES.** The award is proper. 
   First, under the Spanish Civil Code of 1889, damages for torts are measured similarly to contracts in bad faith, covering both *damnum emergens* (actual loss) and *lucrum cessans* (lost profit) under Article 1106. Saturnino is liable for the prejudice caused by his deceit and abandonment.
   Second, the dismissal of the child's support case is not *res judicata* to the mother's claim for damages. The issue in the support case was filiation/recognition, while the issue here is the damage suffered by the mother due to Saturnino's tortious conduct. The expenses incurred for the child are elements of these damages.
   Third, the Court rejected Saturnino's argument that damages for maintenance should be limited to the income tax deduction amount (P600.00), ruling that tax deductions are fixed for a different purpose and do not constitute a reasonable basis for actual maintenance costs.

   The Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED**.
