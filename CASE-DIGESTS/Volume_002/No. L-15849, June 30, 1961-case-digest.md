I. CAPTION
BERNARDO SEBASTIAN v. JUAN N. GERARDO, in his capacity as Hearing Officer of Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor, and CRISPIN SELOSA, G.R. No. L-15849, June 30, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Crispin Selosa, employed as a helper mechanic by petitioner Bernardo Sebastian, filed a complaint for the collection of overtime pay with Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor [1]. The Hearing Officer, Juan N. Gerardo, rendered a decision awarding Selosa P850.37 [1]. Sebastian filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to declare the proceedings null and void, arguing the Regional Office lacked jurisdiction [2]. The CFI dismissed the petition on the ground that Sebastian failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not appealing to the Labor Standards Commission as required by Reorganization Plan No. 20-A [3]. Sebastian appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Regional Office No. 3 has jurisdiction over money claims such as overtime pay under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A.
2. W/N the petitioner’s failure to appeal to the Labor Standards Commission bars him from raising the issue of jurisdiction in court.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Regional Office No. 3 lacks jurisdiction. The Supreme Court held that the provision of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, particularly Section 25, which grants regional offices original and exclusive jurisdiction over money claims (e.g., overtime pay), is not authorized by Republic Act No. 997, the law creating the Government Survey and Reorganization Commission [4]. The legislature did not intend to empower the Commission to transfer jurisdiction over money claims from ordinary courts of justice to regional offices [4].

2. **NO.** The petitioner was not barred from filing the petition. Since the Regional Office had no jurisdiction to hear the claim, all proceedings before it were null and void [5, 6]. Consequently, it was not necessary for Sebastian to appeal first to the Labor Standards Commission to question said jurisdiction [6]. An objection to jurisdiction is not waived by the failure to appeal and may be raised at any time before the courts of justice [5, 6].

The proceedings before and judgment by the regional office are set aside [7].
