I. CAPTION
PAMPANGA SUGAR DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, INC. v. F. A. FUENTES, MARCOS PLOMANTES, et al., G.R. No. L-14738, July 31, 1961, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
On August 8, 1958, respondent employees filed a complaint against petitioner Pampanga Sugar Development Company, Inc. with Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor for the collection of unpaid wages for work rendered on Sundays and legal holidays [1]. Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the complaint stated no cause of action and that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, which granted jurisdiction to the regional offices, was unconstitutional [2]. Petitioner maintained that claims under Commonwealth Act No. 444 were exclusively cognizable by the Court of Industrial Relations [3]. The Hearing Officer denied the motion and subsequent reconsiderations [3]. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court to annul the proceedings and enjoin the respondents from proceeding with the case [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Regional Offices of the Department of Labor have jurisdiction over money claims under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the grant of original and exclusive jurisdiction to regional offices over money claims—including overtime pay, unpaid wages, and wages for Sundays and legal holidays—is not authorized by Republic Act No. 997 [4, 5]. The Legislature did not intend to grant the Government Survey and Reorganization Commission the authority to deprive courts of jurisdiction over such claims and transfer them to regional offices [5, 6]. The Court relied on its recent rulings in *Equitable Banking Corporation v. Regional Office 3* and *Corominas v. Labor Standards Commission* to invalidate the jurisdiction claimed by the respondents [7].

Petition is **GRANTED**, the orders of the respondent officials are set aside, and the preliminary injunction is made permanent [8].
