I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROLANDO DE LA CRUZ, G.R. No. L-13974, August 31, 1961, Padilla, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On November 20, 1957, at around 8:00 P.M. in Bacolod City, Maria Tan heard her husband, Gung Hoc, groan inside their store. Upon checking, she saw the appellant, Rolando de la Cruz, taking P400.00 from a drawer [3]. Maria grappled with the appellant, biting him on the breast, but he beat her with a piece of wood and escaped [3]. Gung Hoc died the following day from intracranial hemorrhage due to a skull fracture [4]. The trial court convicted De la Cruz of robbery with homicide and slight physical injuries, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* [2, 5]. The appellant appealed, claiming alibi, and later filed a motion for new trial in the Supreme Court, attaching a letter claiming another inmate confessed to the crime [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellant's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt.
2. W/N the motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence should be granted.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The appellant was positively identified by the victim, Maria Tan, and three other witnesses (Felisa Tañoan, Maria Saroña, and Abner Absin) [8, 9]. Physical evidence corroborated the victim's testimony; the trial court found a scar on the appellant's chest consistent with Maria Tan's testimony that she bit him, a scar the appellant could not explain [10]. The Court held that the defense of alibi and denial cannot prevail over positive identification and overwhelming evidence [9].

2. **NO.** The Court denied the motion because it failed to comply with Section 3, Rule 117 of the Rules of Court [7]. This provision requires that a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence "must be supported by the affidavits of the witnesses by whom such evidence is expected to be given" [11]. The appellant merely submitted a letter addressed to his counsel regarding the alleged confession, which was insufficient [7].

**Disposition:** The judgment is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the appellant is further ordered to indemnify the complainant Maria Tan in the sum of P400.00 [7, 12].
