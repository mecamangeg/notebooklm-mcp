I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. OSCAR CASTELO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-10774, August 24, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
The Supreme Court issued a resolution on February 16, 1961, ordering the case remanded to the lower court to reconstruct the testimony of witnesses whose stenographic notes were lost. The directive required retaking the testimony of original witnesses who were still available. Judge Cecilia Muñoz-Palma returned the case to the Supreme Court seeking new instructions, stating that reconstructing the "original testimony" was legally and physically impossible. She interpreted the order as requiring a word-for-word reproduction of the lost testimony. The record was complete except for the missing testimony of one deceased witness and four other witnesses who were still available.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the partial loss of testimonial evidence requires a new trial instead of reconstruction under Act No. 3110.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that a new trial is only applicable when the *entire* testimonial evidence has been lost or becomes unavailable. In cases of partial loss or destruction of a judicial record, Article 43 of Act No. 3110 applies, which allows the destroyed portion to be reconstituted. The Court clarified that its directive did not demand a physical impossibility (word-for-word reproduction), but rather a substantial reconstruction of the testimony originally given. Since most witnesses were available, the lower court was ordered to proceed with the reconstruction as originally directed.
