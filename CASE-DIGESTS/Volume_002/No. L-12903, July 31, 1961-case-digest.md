I. CAPTION
PEDRO C. PASTORAL v. THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, THE SHERIFF OF DAGUPAN CITY AND SILVINO CERVANTES, G.R. No. L-12903, July 31, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Silvino Cervantes filed a claim for injury against his employer, petitioner Pedro Pastoral, and obtained an award of P3,000.00 from the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC). After the award allegedly became final and executory, the WCC issued a writ of execution on May 6, 1957, directing the Sheriff of Dagupan City to enforce the decision. The Sheriff subsequently advertised Pastoral's properties for sale. Pastoral filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition, contending that the WCC lacked the authority to issue writs of execution, as Section 51 of the Workmen’s Compensation Law vests such power in the courts. Respondents argued that the WCC was authorized to issue writs of execution under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A and Republic Act No. 997.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Workmen’s Compensation Commission has the power to issue a writ of execution to enforce its awards.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is without authority to issue a writ of execution of its award or decision.

The Court held that the power to order the execution of a decision is essentially a judicial function. Under Section 51 of Act No. 3428 (Workmen’s Compensation Law), the proper procedure for enforcement is for the interested party to file a certified copy of the Commission's decision in the court of record where the accident occurred. It is this court that renders judgment based on the decision and issues the writ of execution. The Court emphasized that the Reorganization Acts (R.A. No. 997) could not validly transfer judicial power from the courts to the WCC, as the legislature cannot delegate the power to create courts or diminish the jurisdiction of existing courts to an executive body like the Reorganization Commission. Thus, the writ of execution issued by the WCC was declared null and void.

Petition granted; the order of execution is set aside.
