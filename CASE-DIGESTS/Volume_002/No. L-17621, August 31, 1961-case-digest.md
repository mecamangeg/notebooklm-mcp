I. CAPTION
TOMAS MALLORCA v. NICOLAS C. ADOLFO and ZACARIAS V. MENDOZA, G.R. No. L-17621, August 31, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On August 24, 1960, the Chief of Police filed a complaint in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Subic, Zambales, charging petitioner Tomas Mallorca with theft of United States property valued at $1,478.05. The offense was allegedly committed on August 18, 1960, within the U.S. Naval Base in Subic Bay. The JP of Subic issued a warrant of arrest, leading to Mallorca's detention.

Mallorca filed a petition for *habeas corpus* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zambales, arguing that the JP of Subic lacked jurisdiction because the crime occurred outside its territorial limits. Historically, Olongapo was a barrio of Subic, but its JP court had exercised jurisdiction over the U.S. Naval Base since 1947. On December 7, 1959, Olongapo became a separate municipality. The prosecution argued that because the crime scene lay outside the new boundaries of the "Community of Olongapo," it fell under Subic's jurisdiction. The CFI granted the writ and ordered Mallorca's release, ruling that the JP of Olongapo retained jurisdiction. The Fiscal appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Justice of the Peace of Subic has jurisdiction over an offense committed within the U.S. Naval Base following the separation of Olongapo as a municipality.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the Justice of the Peace of Olongapo retains jurisdiction.

The Court relied on **Section 69 of the Judiciary Act (R.A. 296, as amended)**, which provides that when a new political division affects the territorial jurisdiction of a justice of the peace, the justice exercising jurisdiction over the territory prior to the change shall continue to do so until the President designates otherwise. Since the JP of Olongapo had exercised jurisdiction over the entire U.S. Naval Base since 1947, and no contrary designation was made by the President when the crime was committed in 1960, the JP of Olongapo retains jurisdiction over the area. Consequently, the warrant issued by the JP of Subic was null and void.

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**, without prejudice to the refiling of the complaint in the Justice of the Peace Court of Olongapo.
