**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FLORO TILA-ON, BELTRAN AGRAVA and VICTOR DAZO, G.R. No. L-12406, June 30, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
On June 18, 1955, at around 5:00 PM in Burauen, Leyte, accused Floro Tila-on, Beltran Agrava, and Victor Dazo went to the store-residence of Severo Agustin [3]. Pretending to buy cigarettes, they waited for Severo to turn his back to get the merchandise [3]. Suddenly, Tila-on stabbed Severo in the back [3]. Agrava and Dazo then delivered additional stab blows to the victim [3]. Severo managed to wound Dazo on the thigh before dying from internal hemorrhage caused by three stab wounds on his back [3, 4]. The motive was traced to Severo reporting a 1952 robbery committed by Tila-on’s group [4].

The Court of First Instance of Leyte convicted the three accused of murder and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua* [2]. Tila-on withdrew his appeal, leaving Agrava and Dazo as the appellants [2]. The defense claimed Tila-on acted in self-defense and defense of Dazo, alleging Severo was the aggressor due to jealousy, but the Court found this version inconsistent and improbable [5, 6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the killing was qualified by treachery.
2. W/N there was conspiracy among the accused.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The crime committed is murder qualified by treachery. The Court held that the attack was sudden, achieved from behind the victim who was misled into remaining passive and unsuspecting, and executed while the victim was not in a position to offer an effective defense [7]. This aligns with Art. 14, par. 16 of the Revised Penal Code [7].

2. **YES.** Conspiracy existed among the accused. Their collective criminal design was inferred from their arrival at the scene together, their presence from the start up to the consummation of the crime, and their acting in concert throughout the commission of the offense pursuant to the same evident objective [7]. Citing *People v. Mandagay*, the Court ruled their responsibility is collective [7]. Consequently, the appellants are guilty as principals by direct participation under Art. 17, par. 1 of the Revised Penal Code [7].

**Judgment affirmed.** [8]
