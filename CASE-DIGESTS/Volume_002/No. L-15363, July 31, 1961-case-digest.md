I. CAPTION
NATIONAL LABOR UNION v. INSULAR-YEBANA TOBACCO CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-15363, July 31, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner National Labor Union filed charges of unfair labor practice (ULP) against respondent Insular-Yebana Tobacco Corporation in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). The Union alleged the discriminatory dismissal of employees Juana Torres, Dominador Gonzales, and Honorato Gabriel due to union activities.

After trial, the CIR Judge found that the dismissals were not caused by union activities but by other reasons (e.g., a quarrel for Gonzales, machine breakdown for Gabriel). Consequently, the Judge recommended the dismissal of the complaints. The CIR *en banc* sustained this decision. However, a dissenting opinion in the CIR argued that since the dismissals were not "fully justified" and the offenses were trivial, the employees should be reinstated with back wages. The Union appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning whether the CIR could order reinstatement and back pay even if the ULP charge was not proved.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations can order the reinstatement of dismissed employees in an unfair labor practice case when the charge of unfair labor practice is not proved.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has no power to grant a remedy such as reinstatement or back wages if the unfair labor practice charge is not proved.

Under Section 5(c) of the Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act No. 875), the law expressly mandates that if the acts alleged to constitute unfair labor practice have not been proved, the CIR "shall issue an order dismissing the said complaint." ULP proceedings are in the nature of public prosecutions for offenses against public right or policy. In contrast, a breach of an employer's obligation to an employee (such as an unjustified dismissal without union discrimination) is a private contractual breach to be redressed like an ordinary obligation, not through ULP proceedings.

Furthermore, Section 5(b) of R.A. 875 prohibits the CIR from exercising powers of mediation and conciliation in ULP cases. The power of mediation and conciliation generally lies with the Department of Labor under Section 18 of the same Act, or with the CIR only in certified cases involving industries indispensable to the national interest, which was not the case here.

Consequently, the SC affirmed the lower court's decision.

**Charges dismissed.**
