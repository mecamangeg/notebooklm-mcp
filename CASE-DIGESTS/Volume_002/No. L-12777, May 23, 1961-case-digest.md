I. CAPTION
SEPTEMIO CEBEDO, ET AL. v. DIRECTOR OF LANDS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-12777, May 23, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Septemio and Abelardo Cebedo were issued Free Patents and Original Certificates of Title for portions of Lot No. 2012 in Tangub, Misamis Occidental in May 1952 [1]. Private respondents (Pescadero, et al.), claiming to be the actual occupants, filed civil cases for annulment of titles, but these were dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies [2]. Consequently, respondents filed a protest with the Director of Lands, who subsequently ordered an investigation to determine if the titles should be cancelled [3, 4]. Petitioners filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance to stop the investigation, arguing the Director lacked jurisdiction [4]. The trial court ruled against petitioners [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for prohibition is proper given the failure to appeal to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.
2. W/N the Director of Lands has the authority to investigate the validity of free patent titles that have already been issued.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the writ of prohibition cannot be granted because the petitioners failed to exhaust available administrative remedies. Specifically, they failed to appeal the Director of Lands' order to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources before resorting to the courts. The writ of prohibition is an extraordinary remedy that issues only in the absence of an appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law [7, 8].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that under **Section 91 of the Public Land Law (Commonwealth Act No. 141)**, it is not only the right but the duty of the Director of Lands to conduct investigations to determine whether facts exist (such as fraud) that would justify filing a court action for the annulment of titles and the reversion of the property to the State [9, 10]. The investigation complained of is merely preliminary and necessary for the Director to determine if steps should be taken in the proper court [11].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [6].
