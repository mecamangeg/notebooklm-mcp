I. CAPTION
INTERNATIONAL TOBACCO CO., INC. v. WANG WAN TAT and PEK HOCK LENG, G.R. No. L-12808, May 30, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On December 10, 1956, defendant Wang Wan Tat executed a promissory note for P5,000.00 in favor of plaintiff International Tobacco Co., Inc., payable in four equal quarterly installments [1]. To secure the note, Wang Wan Tat and co-defendant Pek Hock Leng (as surety) executed a Surety Bond stipulating that the amount was payable in four equal installments for a period of twelve months commencing on December 10, 1956, and that the surety would immediately pay the full amount upon the principal's failure to pay [2, 3].

On June 28, 1957, due to Wang Wan Tat's failure to pay any installment, the plaintiff filed a complaint for collection [4]. The defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing the action was premature because the promissory note stated "Twelve (12) months after date," implying maturity only on December 10, 1957 [5]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that the obligation had not yet matured and thus stated no cause of action [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the complaint states a valid cause of action despite being filed before the expiration of the twelve-month period stated in the promissory note.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the dismissal. While the promissory note contained the phrase "Twelve (12) months after date," the Surety Bond, which formed part of the complaint, explicitly provided that the P5,000.00 sum was "payable on four (4) equal installments for a period of twelve (12) months commencing on December 10, 1956" [6].

The Court ruled that the failure to pay any of the installments on the respective quarter constituted a breach giving rise to a valid cause of action [7, 8]. Furthermore, under the conditions of the Surety Bond, the principal's failure to pay the stipulated obligation made the whole amount immediately demandable against the surety [8].

The Order was SET ASIDE and the case was REMANDED to the lower court for further proceedings [9].
