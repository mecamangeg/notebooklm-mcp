I. CAPTION
FLAVIANO LOTA v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and MOISES SANGALANG, G.R. No. L-14803, June 30, 1961, Natividad, J.

II. FACTS
Moises Sangalang served as the caretaker of the municipal cemetery of Taal, Batangas since 1951. On July 1, 1955, the local Health Officer extended a new promotional appointment to him to increase his salary. However, on February 13, 1956, Mayor Flaviano Lota appointed Jose Sangalang to the position, alleging that Moises had abandoned the office. Moises filed an action to recover the office. The Court of First Instance ruled in Moises' favor, declaring him the legal appointee and ousting Jose. The Court of Appeals affirmed Moises' right to the office but declined to rule on the salary payment, leaving it to administrative officials. Mayor Lota appealed, arguing that the proper remedy was *mandamus*, that the Municipality of Taal was an indispensable party, and that Moises was validly replaced.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action is properly one of *quo warranto* rather than *mandamus*.
2. W/N the Municipality of Taal is an indispensable party to the action.
3. W/N Moises Sangalang is entitled to hold the office.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** *Quo warranto* is the proper remedy to try the right to an office and oust the holder from its enjoyment, whereas *mandamus* only lies to enforce clear legal duties and not to try disputed titles [1, 2]. Since Jose Sangalang claims to be the duly appointed caretaker and is currently occupying the office, the purpose of the action is to try the title to the public office and oust the alleged unlawful holder [3].
2. **NO.** In an action for *quo warranto*, the only necessary parties are the person in unlawful possession of the office and those claiming to be entitled to it [4, 5]. The Municipality of Taal is not an essential party because it does not claim the right to occupy the office itself [5]. Furthermore, unlike cases requiring a new appropriation of funds, the funds for the salary already existed, and the municipal treasurer only needed to disburse them [5].
3. **YES.** Moises Sangalang held the position since 1951 and had not resigned or abandoned the office when the new appointment was issued [6]. Under Section 2199 of the Revised Administrative Code, the local health officer is empowered to appoint the cemetery caretaker, and under Section 2201, such employee cannot be dismissed without cause [7]. As no formal charges were filed against Moises, his ouster was illegal [7].

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [8].
