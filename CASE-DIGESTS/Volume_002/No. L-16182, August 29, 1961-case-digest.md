**I. CAPTION**
ZAMBALES CHROMITE MINING CO. v. JOSE ROBLES, G.R. No. L-16182, August 29, 1961, Labrador, J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
On November 2, 1956, Zambales Chromite Mining Company filed a complaint against Jose Robles in the Justice of the Peace Court of Sta. Cruz, Zambales, seeking his ejectment from certain mining claims and the payment of rentals and royalties [1, 3]. In the lower court, Robles did not file a written answer but only made a verbal denial of the allegations [3]. After the Justice of the Peace Court rendered judgment in favor of the company, Robles appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zambales [3]. In the CFI, Robles filed an answer containing several counterclaims for damages and overpayments which were not pleaded in the lower court [4]. The company moved to dismiss the counterclaims on the ground that these issues were not raised in the Justice of the Peace Court [5]. The CFI granted the motion and dismissed the counterclaims, prompting Robles to appeal to the Supreme Court [1, 5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the defendant may raise counterclaims in the Court of First Instance on appeal that were not raised in the Justice of the Peace Court. [6, 7]

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal. Under Section 9, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court, an appeal from the Justice of the Peace Court to the Court of First Instance stands for trial *de novo* [6, 8]. This provision limits the parties to the issues raised in the inferior court and prevents them from raising new issues or counterclaims in the appellate court [6, 8]. Citing *Yu Lay v. Galmes* and *Sarreal v. Tan*, the Court held that parties cannot file pleadings in the CFI raising questions essentially distinct from those lawfully raised in the court of origin [9]. To allow litigants to raise issues without order and regulation would cause confusion [7, 10]. While the defendant is not precluded from filing a separate action for his claims, he cannot raise them for the first time on appeal [10].

The order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED** [2].
