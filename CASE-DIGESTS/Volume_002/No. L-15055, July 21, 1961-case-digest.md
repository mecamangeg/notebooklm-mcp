I. CAPTION
CONSOLACION ROSETE, et al. v. PABLO ROSETE, G.R. No. L-15055, July 21, 1961, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
On August 8, 1956, Consolacion Rosete and her minor siblings, assisted by their mother Eugenia Carag, filed a complaint in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court (JDRC) against Pablo Rosete. They sought recognition as his illegitimate children and support, alleging that Pablo, although legally married to another, cohabited with their mother starting in 1945 resulting in their births [1, 2]. Pablo denied the paternity, alleging the children were fathered by other men [3].

On August 18, 1958, the JDRC ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, ordering Pablo to recognize the minors as his illegitimate children and pay attorney's fees [4, 5]. Pablo appealed directly to the Supreme Court, arguing that the trial court erred in its factual findings regarding witness credibility. He also raised a constitutional argument, claiming his right against self-incrimination was violated when the court compelled him to write to provide handwriting samples [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the appeal falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals [7, 8].

Under Section 38-E of Republic Act No. 409 (Charter of the City of Manila), as amended by Republic Act No. 1401, decisions of the JDRC are appealed in the same manner as those from Courts of First Instance. The Court found that the appeal involved largely questions of fact regarding the appreciation of evidence, and the constitutional question raised regarding self-incrimination was not substantial [7]. Pursuant to Section 2 of Republic Act No. 2613, which amended the Judiciary Act of 1948, appeals involving factual questions fall under the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.

Accordingly, the case was ordered certified to the Court of Appeals for determination [8].
