I. CAPTION
AMELIA C. YUTUK v. MANILA ELECTRIC COMPANY, G.R. No. L-13016, May 31, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Amelia C. Yutuk, a lawyer, was a customer of defendant Manila Electric Company (Meralco). On October 13, 1955, Meralco’s meter inspector, Eliseo Jaime, entered Yutuk's premises without permission, broke the meter seal alone, and falsely alleged she was using a "jumper" to steal electricity [1-3]. Jaime treated Yutuk with disrespect, accusing her of theft, which caused Yutuk, who was convalescing from broncho-pneumonia, to suffer a relapse [4, 5]. Meralco subsequently demanded payment for unregistered consumption and threatened disconnection, prompting Yutuk to file a civil action for injunction and damages [6].

Nearly a month after the civil case began, Meralco filed a criminal complaint for theft of electricity against Yutuk [7]. The fiscal dismissed the criminal case for lack of *prima facie* evidence [7]. Yutuk then filed a supplemental complaint claiming moral and exemplary damages for the malicious filing of the criminal charge [8]. The trial court ruled in favor of Yutuk, awarding PhP 250,000 in moral damages, PhP 8,000 in exemplary damages, and attorney's fees [9]. Meralco appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Yutuk is entitled to moral and exemplary damages.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that Meralco's acts were wrongful and reckless. The inspector's conduct—dismantling the meter without a witness, using trickery to obtain a signature, and insulting the customer—constituted a wrongful act [10, 11]. Furthermore, Meralco's filing of the criminal charge was motivated by malice and bad faith, intended as a retaliatory measure and a "weapon to force an alleged debtor to pay" rather than a legitimate legal remedy [11, 12].

Under Article 2217 of the New Civil Code, moral damages are recoverable for mental anguish, besmirched reputation, and social humiliation resulting from the defendant's wrongful act [13]. Under Articles 2229 and 2234, exemplary damages are imposed for the public good [14]. However, the Supreme Court found the trial court's award of PhP 250,000 exorbitant.

The decision was **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**. The moral damages were reduced to PhP 25,000; exemplary damages were increased to PhP 10,000; and the award of PhP 5,000 for attorney's fees was maintained [15, 16].
