I. CAPTION
UDE SOLIMAN (BAGOBA) v. ICDANG (BAGOBO) and YO-ON (BAGOBA), G.R. No. L-15924, May 31, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Adolfo Icdang married Ude Soliman in 1940. In 1941, the Director of Lands approved Adolfo’s homestead application [1]. Adolfo died in 1944 during the Japanese occupation. Ude left the land, while Adolfo's parents, defendants Icdang and Yo-on, remained in possession and cultivated it [1, 2]. In 1954, Ude secured a patent and Original Certificate of Title No. U-549 issued in the name of the "Heirs of Adolfo Icdang" [1].

Ude filed an action for partition, claiming the land was conjugal property and she was entitled to one-half [1]. The Court of First Instance of Davao ruled that the land was conjugal property, awarding Ude one-half *pro-indiviso* as her exclusive share and the other half to the defendants as heirs [3]. The defendants appealed, arguing the land belongs solely to the heirs of Adolfo Icdang because the patent was issued to the heirs and not the conjugal partnership [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the homestead land belongs to the conjugal partnership of the deceased applicant and his widow.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the land belongs to the heirs of Adolfo Icdang, not the conjugal partnership. An applicant acquires a vested right over a homestead "only by the presentation of the final proof and its approval by the Director of Lands" (*Ingaran v. Ramelo*, *Balboa v. Farrales*) [5]. In this case, final proof was presented and approved after Adolfo's death, and thus after the dissolution of the conjugal partnership [5]. Consequently, the land could not have formed part of said partnership [6].

Under Section 105 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 (and Act No. 3517), the right of the widow to obtain the patent in her own name was abolished; instead, the deceased applicant is succeeded by his "heirs in law" if they show compliance with legal requirements [6, 7]. Applying Articles 935 and 836 of the Spanish Civil Code (the law in force at the time of Adolfo's death), his parents (defendants) inherit the land to the exclusion of collaterals, but the surviving spouse (Ude) is entitled to a usufruct over one-third of the estate [8, 9].

The decision was **MODIFIED** declaring the land belongs to the heirs: the parents are the owners, subject to Ude's usufruct over one-third of the property [10, 11].
