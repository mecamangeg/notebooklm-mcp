I. CAPTION
LAZARO BOOC v. SERGIO OSMEÑA, JR., et al., G.R. No. L-14810, May 31, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lazaro Booc was employed in the Office of the City Engineer of Cebu, with his last appointment as General Bridge Foreman effective July 1, 1956. The appointment was specific for the period ending September 30, 1956, and contained a notation that employment would cease automatically at the end of the period or via lay-off at the discretion of the City Engineer, depending on the availability of funds. On August 27, 1956, Respondent Mayor Osmeña dismissed Booc for dishonesty and serious misconduct. The Assistant City Engineer implemented the dismissal on August 29, 1956, advising Booc to appeal to the Secretary of Public Works and Communications. Instead of appealing to the Department Head, Booc filed a petition for mandamus in the Court of First Instance of Cebu on September 11, 1956. The lower court dismissed the petition, ruling that Booc’s employment was temporary. Booc appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for mandamus is barred by the failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to security of tenure against arbitrary dismissal.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that an aggrieved party must first exhaust all administrative remedies before resorting to court action. Under Section 21 of Commonwealth Act No. 58, the petitioner should have appealed the dismissal to the proper Department Head, the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, as advised by the Assistant City Engineer. His failure to do so renders the petition for mandamus without merit [1-3].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner is not covered by the mantle of protection against arbitrary dismissals afforded to permanent employees holding permanent items. His appointment was temporary, explicitly stating it was terminable at the end of the period or by reason of rotation or lay-off at the discretion of the appointing power. Since his job depended on the availability of funds, he could be removed at any time [3-5].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [6].
