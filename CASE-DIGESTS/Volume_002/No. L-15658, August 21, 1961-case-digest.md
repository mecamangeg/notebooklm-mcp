I. CAPTION
**CALTEX (PHILIPPINES), INC. v. CRISTETA VILLANUEVA, for herself and in behalf of her minor child, and the WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION**, G.R. No. L-15658, August 21, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Dominador Maramot was employed as a messboy on petitioner Caltex’s vessel, *MV Caltex Mindanao*. On October 10, 1956, while the vessel was in open sea near Ticao Pass, Samar, Maramot went missing [1]. Despite a diligent search, he was not found [2]. On October 24, 1956, respondent Cristeta Villanueva (Maramot's wife) filed a claim for death compensation [3]. Caltex admitted in a report dated November 6, 1956, that Maramot was "lost at sea and presumed dead as of October 10, 1956," but later argued that the claim was controverted [3, 4].

The Regional Administrator (Region 3) treated the claim as uncontroverted and awarded PHP 4,000 in compensation to the widow [5]. Caltex moved for reconsideration, arguing: (1) it had controverted the claim (albeit late) because it had to wait for marine inquiries; (2) the Regional Administrator lacked jurisdiction to decide controverted cases; and (3) under Article 391 of the Civil Code, a missing person cannot be presumed dead until four years have passed [4, 6]. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed the award, ruling that the disappearance gave rise to a reasonable inference of death by drowning [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Regional Administrator had jurisdiction to decide the claim as an uncontroverted case.
2. W/N the widow is entitled to compensation despite the non-lapse of the four-year period for presumption of death under the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Regional Administrator had jurisdiction because the claim was uncontroverted. Under the Workmen's Compensation Act and relevant rules, an employer must controvert a claim within 14 days of the accident or 10 days from knowledge thereof [8]. Caltex knew of the disappearance on October 10, 1956, but only filed notice on November 6, 1956, without filing a petition under oath to reinstate its right to controvert [9]. Consequently, Caltex waived its right to a hearing, and the Regional Administrator was authorized to adjudicate the uncontroverted claim [9, 10].

2. **YES.** The widow is entitled to immediate compensation. The Court ruled that the presumption of death under Article 391 of the Civil Code, which requires a period of four years, applies to the settlement of estates, not to claims under the Workmen’s Compensation Act [11]. In labor compensation cases, the disappearance of an employee on board a vessel in the open sea gives rise to a reasonable inference that he accidentally fell and drowned, making the death compensable as arising out of employment [7, 12].

The decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is **AFFIRMED** [13].
