**I. CAPTION**
TEODOSIA NATIVIDAD and RUFINO POQUIZ v. MARCELIANO NADAL, TOMAS NADAL, FILEMON NADAL and ISABELO MENDOZA, G.R. No. L-14852, May 30, 1961, Padilla, J.

**II. FACTS**
Mariano Natividad, father of petitioner Teodosia Natividad, was issued a Homestead Patent and Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 1633 in 1934 for a parcel of land in Pangasinan [1, 2]. However, an annotation on the back of the title indicated that a portion of the land (Lot No. 1) overlapped with a lot excluded from a previous land registration application by Antonia Tamondong (Lot No. 34) [2]. This exclusion was ordered by the land registration court in 1928 and affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1929 because respondent Marceliano Nadal had proved his ownership and possession of that specific portion [3, 4].

Respondents had been in actual possession of Lot No. 34 since 1908 or 1922 [5]. Petitioners only took possession in 1942, clearing the land over respondents' objections [5]. Petitioners filed a complaint to quiet title. The trial court dismissed the complaint and confirmed respondents' ownership, declaring the homestead patent void regarding the disputed portion [6]. Petitioners appealed, arguing that since no Torrens title was issued to Nadal, they acquired the land by prescription [7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the homestead patent issued to petitioners' predecessor over the disputed land is valid.
2. W/N petitioners acquired ownership of the land by prescription.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The homestead patent is null and void with respect to the disputed lot. The Supreme Court held that the Government cannot grant a homestead patent on a parcel of land already owned by another person [7]. Respondent Nadal had already acquired title to the lot through possession for over twenty years prior to the 1928 judgment in the land registration case [7]. His possession had ripened into ownership, converting the land to private property which is beyond the jurisdiction of the Director of Lands to dispose of [7].

2. **NO.** Petitioners could not acquire ownership by prescription because their possession was in bad faith. They were aware, or chargeable with knowledge, of the flaw in their title due to the explicit annotation on OCT No. 1633 regarding the exclusion of the lot in the prior case [7]. Furthermore, their possession since 1942 was objected to by respondents [7].

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** with the modification that the ownership confirmed to respondents refers specifically to the 45,827 sq. m. area of Lot No. 34 [7, 8].
