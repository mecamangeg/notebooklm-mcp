I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. J. AMADO ARANETA, AMADO ARANETA & CO., INC., and MANILA SURETY & FIDELITY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-14142, May 30, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Defendants J. Amado Araneta and J. Amado Araneta & Co. (Araneta) operated a vessel from 1946 to 1948 without paying the required fixed and common carrier’s taxes. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) assessed them a total liability of P6,364.28. To pay this liability in six monthly installments, Araneta and Manila Surety & Fidelity Co., Inc. (Manila Surety) executed a bond in favor of the Republic on March 18, 1949. The Collector of Internal Revenue received the bond but did not sign the space provided for approval.

Araneta defaulted on the installments. On February 22, 1957, the Republic filed a suit against Araneta and Manila Surety to recover the amount based on the bond. Araneta moved to dismiss, arguing that the action for tax collection had prescribed under the five-year period in Section 331 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) and that the bond was void for lack of the Collector's approval. Manila Surety filed a cross-claim against Araneta for indemnity based on a separate agreement. The lower court ruled in favor of the Republic but dismissed the surety’s cross-claim.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action to collect is barred by prescription.
2. W/N the bond is void because the Collector of Internal Revenue failed to sign/approve it.
3. W/N the surety is entitled to indemnity from the principal defendants.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the defense of prescription under Section 331 of the NIRC is inapplicable because the Republic was suing on the bond, not merely on the tax liability. The bond constitutes a separate and distinct obligation. An action to enforce a written contract prescribes in ten (10) years. Since the bond was executed on March 18, 1949, and the complaint was filed on February 22, 1957, the action was filed within the prescriptive period.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the Collector of Internal Revenue's acts of receiving and keeping the bond, deferring the collection of taxes in reliance on it, and subsequently suing upon it amounted to an approval of the bond. The lack of a signature did not invalidate the obligation.

3. **YES.** The indemnity agreement explicitly stated that the principal shall indemnify the surety "as soon as it has become liable for the payment of any amount... whether or not it shall have paid such sum." Therefore, Manila Surety was entitled to reimbursement from Araneta upon the court's finding of liability.

The judgment of the lower court is **MODIFIED**. The order for defendants to pay the Republic is affirmed, and defendants Araneta are further ordered to reimburse Manila Surety for the amounts paid to the Republic.
