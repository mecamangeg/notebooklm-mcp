I. CAPTION
COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. CONVENTION OF PHILIPPINE BAPTIST CHURCHES and the COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-11807, May 19, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On January 28, 1961, the Supreme Court rendered a decision in this case affirming the judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals "with costs" against the petitioner. On February 21, 1961, the petitioner Collector of Internal Revenue filed a Motion for Reconsideration, praying that the decision be amended to eliminate the imposition of costs of the suit upon him [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N costs can be imposed on the Collector of Internal Revenue.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that costs cannot be imposed on the Collector of Internal Revenue. Relying on previous rulings in *Collector vs. St. Paul’s Hospital* (G.R. No. L-12127) and *Collector vs. Sweeney* (G.R. No. L-12178), the Court found the motion well-founded [1, 2].

The Motion for Reconsideration is **GRANTED**, and the dispositive part of the decision rendered on January 28, 1961, is amended to eliminate the imposition of costs on the petitioner [1, 2].
