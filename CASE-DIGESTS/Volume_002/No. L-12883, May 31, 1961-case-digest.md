I. CAPTION
PEDRO BASES, ET AL. v. FLAVIANO PILARTA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-12883, May 31, 1961, 2 SCRA 333, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants Pedro Bases, et al. filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Abra against defendants-appellees Flaviano Pilarta, et al. to recover their alleged share in two parcels of land. Appellants claimed that the lands were acquired by Paulina Pilarta during her successive marriages to Lucio Perido and Damaso Venus, and were thus conjugal property. The lands were consolidated and registered under Act No. 496 in Paulina's name. The appellees contended that the property was Paulina's exclusive property, which she validly sold to Flaviano Pilarta in 1947, leading to the issuance of a new title in Flaviano’s name.

The CFI rendered judgment dismissing the complaint and declaring the property to be the conjugal property of the appellees (Flaviano Pilarta and his wife). Appellants appealed directly to the Supreme Court. In their record on appeal, appellants announced their intention to question findings of fact made by the lower court, specifically regarding the nature of the property's acquisition, the validity of the deed of sale to Flaviano, and allegations of fraud.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction because the appeal involved both questions of fact and law. The Court noted that to resolve the issues raised by the appellants—such as whether the property was conjugal or exclusive, whether the deed of sale was fraudulent, and whether the consideration was paid—it would be necessary to pass upon and decide several questions of fact based on the evidence.

Under the law at the time, where an appeal involves factual questions and there is no claim that the value of the property in controversy exceeds P200,000.00, jurisdiction belongs to the Court of Appeals. Since the value of the property was not claimed to exceed the statutory limit, the Supreme Court could not take cognizance of the case.

**Disposition:** Record certified to the Court of Appeals.
