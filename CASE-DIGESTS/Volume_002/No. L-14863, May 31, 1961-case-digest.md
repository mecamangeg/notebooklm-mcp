I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SIXTO ARIOJA, HERMOGENES ARARAO, MARIO MOJICA, RUFINO ARARAO, PEDRO VERANO and ALEJANDRO POLICARPIO, G.R. No. L-14863, May 31, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of June 6, 1957, in Bataan, the accused Hermogenes Ararao (appellant), Sixto Arioja, and four others went to the house of Mrs. Elisa Campos. Ararao, who was armed with a revolver, dragged Campos out of her house and the group took her to a field where she was raped by Ararao, Arioja, and others [1, 2]. After the rape, they moved the victim about 15 meters away to a place called Patawiran. There, Ararao and Arioja decided to kill her. She was beaten with a piece of wood until she died [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance of Bataan convicted the group of rape and murder. For the murder charge, the trial court found the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation and sentenced Ararao to death [3, 4]. Ararao appealed the death sentence.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the killing was qualified by evident premeditation to constitute murder.
2. W/N abuse of superior strength can qualify the crime to murder if not alleged in the information.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that evident premeditation was not present because there was no previously concerted plan to kill the victim and no sufficient time elapsed between the inception of the plan and its fulfillment. The evidence showed that the decision to kill was made only after the rape, and the distance between the place of the rape and the killing was only about 15 meters [3].

2. **NO.** While the Court found that abuse of superior strength was proven (six assailants, one armed with a gun and another with wood), it cannot qualify the crime to murder because it was not alleged in the information. Under *People v. Alonzo*, such a circumstance, if proved but not alleged, may only be considered as a generic aggravating circumstance [5].

Consequently, without a qualifying circumstance, the crime committed was Homicide, not Murder. It was attended by two aggravating circumstances: abuse of superior strength and nocturnity. The judgment was **MODIFIED**; the death penalty was set aside, and Ararao was sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 17 years, 4 months and 1 day to 20 years of *reclusion temporal* [6, 7].
