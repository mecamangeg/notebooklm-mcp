I. CAPTION
RICARDO S. SANTOS v. HON. MARIANO NABLE, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-12073, May 23, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ricardo S. Santos, owner of Ace Theater, was assessed a deficiency amusement tax of P4,242.04 by the Collector of Internal Revenue based on a report by a revenue agent [1, 2]. Santos requested a reinvestigation and a hearing before the Conference Staff to dispute the agent's findings, specifically asking to examine the books of account taken from him during the investigation [2]. However, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) could not produce the books, admitting they were lost while in its possession [2, 3]. The Conference Staff affirmed the assessment, and the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) subsequently upheld it, ruling that Santos failed to present evidence to disprove the assessment [2]. Santos appealed, arguing he was deprived of the best evidence to prove his case due to the loss of his books by the BIR [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the taxpayer should be allowed to prove the incorrectness of the assessment by secondary evidence given that his books were lost by the BIR.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while a taxpayer generally bears the burden of proving an assessment is incorrect, Santos was deprived of the best means of doing so because the BIR agent lost his books of account [5]. The Court observed that Santos was not acting in bad faith or merely attempting to delay payment, having already paid a considerable sum of P10,841.00 [6]. It would be unfair to affirm the assessment based solely on the presumption of regularity of official duty when the government itself rendered the taxpayer unable to use his own records [6]. In equity, the taxpayer must be given a last opportunity to prove his contention using secondary evidence [5]. The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the Bureau of Internal Revenue for further proceedings [7].
