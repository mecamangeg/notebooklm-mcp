I. CAPTION
PRISCILLA FERNANDEZ-SUBIDO v. ARSENIO LACSON, as Mayor of Manila, G.R. No. L-16494, August 29, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Fernandez-Subido was a school physician in the Division of City Schools, Manila. On July 22, 1958, Ordinance No. 4033 was enacted, creating four new positions for school physicians in the Manila Health Department. Petitioner claimed an understanding existed that these positions were intended for incumbent physicians like herself. Respondent Mayor Lacson, however, appointed other persons to the new positions, allegedly excluding Petitioner because she was the sister-in-law of a political critic and not affiliated with the Mayor's party. Petitioner filed an action for mandamus and prohibition to compel the Mayor to appoint her. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint upon a motion to dismiss, ruling it failed to state a cause of action.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N mandamus lies to compel the City Mayor to appoint the petitioner to the newly created position.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. The Court held that the power to appoint employees, vested in the Mayor by Section 11 of the Manila City Charter, is an executive function involving discretion that cannot be controlled by the courts. Under the principle of separation of powers, the judiciary cannot command the executive in the exercise of functions that are purely executive and confided to his conscience and judgment [1, 2].

Furthermore, mandamus requires a clear legal duty on the part of the respondent and a clear legal right on the part of the petitioner [3]. The Court found that the ordinance created entirely new positions in the Health Department (appointed by the Mayor), distinct from Petitioner's position in the Division of City Schools (appointed by the Secretary of Education) [4]. Thus, Petitioner had no clear legal right to the appointment. While she may have had a moral right, and the Mayor a moral duty, such are insufficient in law to justify mandamus [3]. Finally, the Court noted the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not appealing to the President or Department Head [5].

The order of dismissal is affirmed; petition denied.
