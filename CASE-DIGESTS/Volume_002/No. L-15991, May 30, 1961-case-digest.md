I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF ADRIAN FONG TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. ADRIAN FONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-15991, May 30, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Adrian Fong filed for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal [1]. On December 7, 1958, the CFI initially granted the petition, finding he possessed all qualifications [2]. On January 9, 1959, the Solicitor General moved to reopen the case to present new evidence that Fong had circumvented the Constitutional prohibition against aliens acquiring real property [2]. The CFI granted the reopening over Fong's objection [2].

The government’s evidence showed that a residential lot was purchased in the name of Fong’s Filipino mother-in-law, Filomena David [3]. However, David was elderly (69 years old), had no independent income, and lived with and was supported by Fong and his wife [4-6]. Checks for the housing loan were issued to Fong’s wife, who administered the construction, and the Fong family resided there [7, 8]. An affidavit also identified Fong as the person paying for the lot [6, 7]. Based on this, the CFI reversed its decision and denied the petition [9]. Fong appealed, challenging the reopening of the case and the findings [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in reopening the case to receive new evidence from the government.
2. W/N the petitioner is disqualified for circumventing the Constitutional prohibition against alien land ownership.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The trial court did not abuse its discretion in reopening the case. The Supreme Court held that naturalization is a privilege or a gift bestowed by the State upon an alien [9, 10]. Consequently, it is important that every opportunity be given to the government to determine if the applicant is truly deserving and qualified beyond peradventure of doubt [9, 10]. The court is justified in setting aside its own decision to receive new evidence involving an important policy of the State [9, 11].

2. **YES.** The petitioner is disqualified. The Court found that the circumstances regarding the property acquisition created serious doubts that must be resolved adversely to the petitioner [6]. The evidence indicated an attempt to circumvent the Constitution; the mother-in-law had no means to purchase the property, while Fong and his wife (who became a Chinese citizen upon marriage) were the actual interested parties who paid for and utilized the property [3, 5, 6, 8].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [12].
