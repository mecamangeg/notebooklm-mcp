I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE PLYWOOD CORPORATION v. NATIONAL LABOR UNION, G.R. No. L-15190, May 30, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In August 1950, petitioner Philippine Plywood Corporation dismissed 37 employees shortly after an administrative complaint was filed against its General Manager for various irregularities [1, 2]. The respondent Union filed a case with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). On October 22, 1958, the CIR rendered a decision declaring the dismissals unjustified and ordering reinstatement with backpay [1]. The CIR *en banc* denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration on January 30, 1959 [3]. Petitioner filed a notice of appeal on March 11, 1959, forty days after the decision, despite the 10-day period prescribed by Commonwealth Act No. 103 [3]. Realizing the appeal was time-barred, petitioner filed a "special civil action for certiorari" with the Supreme Court on April 16, 1959, alleging the CIR committed grave abuse of discretion in weighing the evidence [1, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition can be treated as an appeal by certiorari.
2. W/N the special civil action for certiorari is the proper remedy.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 14 of Commonwealth Act No. 103, an aggrieved party has ten (10) days from the date of the award or decision to appeal to the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari [3]. The petitioner filed its notice of appeal 40 days after the *en banc* resolution, and the petition itself was filed over two months after the deadline [3]. Consequently, the case cannot be considered an appeal by certiorari and must be treated only as a special civil action [3].

2. **NO.** The CIR had jurisdiction over the case and the parties, and its task was to determine the true cause of dismissal based on the evidence [5]. Whether the lower court should have given more credence to the petitioner's evidence is a matter that does not connote an abuse of discretion, much less a grave one, to warrant a special civil action for certiorari [6]. The proper remedy would have been an appeal by certiorari, which is plain, speedy, and adequate, but the petitioner failed to avail of it within the reglementary period [6]. Furthermore, the evidence on record supported the CIR's conclusion that the dismissals were retaliatory and without just cause [2].

Petition dismissed [7].
