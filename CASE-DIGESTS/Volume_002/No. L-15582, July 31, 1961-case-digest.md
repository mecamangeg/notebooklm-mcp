I. CAPTION
FELIX LECTURA v. REGIONAL OFFICE NO. 3 UNDER DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, et al., G.R. Nos. L-15582, L-16061, & L-16685, July 31, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
These are three consolidated cases involving money claims filed by laborers against their employers. In G.R. Nos. L-15582 (*Lectura*) and L-16061 (*Leung*), the Hearing Officers of Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor rendered decisions ordering the employers to pay unpaid wages, overtime, and separation pay. The employers filed petitions for certiorari and prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, questioning the jurisdiction of the Regional Office. The CFI ruled in favor of the employers, declaring Reorganization Plan No. 20-A unconstitutional. The respondents appealed these decisions. In G.R. No. L-16685 (*Regina Inc.*), laborers filed claims for terminal pay. The employers moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, but the Regional Office denied the motion. The employers then filed an original action for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court. The common issue across all cases is the legality of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, under which the Regional Offices assumed jurisdiction over the money claims [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, which grants Regional Offices of the Department of Labor original and exclusive jurisdiction over money claims of laborers, is valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, particularly Section 25, is null and void. The grant of original and exclusive jurisdiction over money claims of laborers to the regional offices was made without the authority of Republic Act No. 997. The Court held that the authority vested by R.A. No. 997 in the Government and Survey and Reorganization Commission was limited to promoting "the better execution of the laws, and the more effective management of the government, and more expeditious administration of public business," as well as "economy" and "efficiency." This legislative delegation did not include the power to confer judicial functions upon the Department of Labor [4-6]. The Court relied on its recent decision in *Corominas v. Labor Standards Commission* (G.R. No. L-14857, June 30, 1961), which established that the Department had no such authority at the time R.A. No. 997 was approved [7].

Accordingly, the decisions appealed from in G.R. Nos. L-15582 and L-16061 are **AFFIRMED**, and the petition in G.R. No. L-16685 is **GRANTED** [8].
