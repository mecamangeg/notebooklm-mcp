I. CAPTION
GUILLERMO GONZALES v. THE HON. JAIME HERNANDEZ, as Secretary of Finance and JOVENCIO FOJAS, G.R. No. L-15482, May 30, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Guillermo Gonzales was an attorney-agent in the Department of Finance. In 1955, he was found guilty of disreputable conduct in an administrative case and ordered to resign or be separated. On May 23, 1955, he tendered his resignation expressly "subject to the result of my appeal with the Civil Service Board of Appeals" [1]. The Undersecretary of Finance accepted this resignation on May 28, 1955 [2]. While his appeal was pending, Gonzales worked as an emergency helper at the GSIS [3], and his wife was appointed to his former position [2]. Subsequently, respondent Jovencio Fojas was appointed to the position after the wife was promoted [3].

On August 5, 1957, the Civil Service Board of Appeals (CSBA) modified the decision, imposing only a two-month suspension without pay and allowing reinstatement [4]. Gonzales attempted to return to duty but was refused by the Secretary of Finance [5]. He filed a petition for *mandamus* and *quo warranto*. The Court of First Instance ruled in his favor, ordering reinstatement but denying back salaries [6]. Both parties appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner’s conditional resignation and its acceptance constituted a valid and complete resignation.
2. W/N the petitioner abandoned his office by accepting temporary employment at the GSIS.
3. W/N the petitioner’s reinstatement is barred due to his wife’s employment in the same office (nepotism).
4. W/N the petitioner is entitled to back salaries.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** There was no complete and operative resignation because there was no clear intention to relinquish the position. The resignation was expressly made "subject to the result of my appeal." Since the CSBA modified the decision and ordered reinstatement, the condition for the resignation (affirmance of dismissal) was not met. The acceptance by the Undersecretary could not convert a conditional resignation into an absolute one [7-9].

2. **NO.** The acceptance of a temporary position as an emergency laborer in the GSIS did not constitute abandonment. The position was not incompatible with his former office. An employee deprived of his office and emoluments during a pending appeal has the right to seek employment to support himself. He could resign from the temporary position once his case was decided in his favor [10-12].

3. **NO.** The objection regarding nepotism is untenable because the petitioner was already employed in the office *before* his wife was appointed. If any objection is to be made, it should be against the wife's subsequent appointment, not the petitioner's reinstatement to his original position [13, 14].

4. **NO.** Back salaries may only be ordered if the officer is completely exonerated and the suspension or dismissal is declared illegal. In this case, the petitioner was not completely exonerated; the CSBA merely modified the penalty to a two-month suspension without pay. Thus, he is not entitled to back salaries [15, 16].

**The decision of the Court of First Instance is AFFIRMED *in toto*.** [17]
