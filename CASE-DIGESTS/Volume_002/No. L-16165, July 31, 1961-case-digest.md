I. CAPTION
PEDRO S. ALIALY, ET AL. v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, G.R. No. L-16165, July 31, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On September 1, 1959, the Nacionalista Party (Victoria, Oriental Mindoro Chapter) filed a collective certificate of candidacy for the petitioners (candidates for councilor) and others for the November 10, 1959 elections. The certificate was signed and sworn to by the Chapter Chairman but lacked the signature of the Party Secretary. On October 14, 1959, respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC) resolved not to give due course to the certificate, ruling that it failed to comply with Section 35 of the Revised Election Code, which requires subscription by both the president (chairman) and secretary of the party. Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration and submitted an amended certificate signed by both officers on October 29, 1959. COMELEC denied the motion, noting the amendment was filed after the September 11 deadline. Petitioners filed for Certiorari and Mandamus, arguing the defect was merely formal. A preliminary mandatory injunction was issued, and petitioner Alialy was subsequently elected.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the collective certificate of candidacy is valid despite lacking the Party Secretary's signature at the time of the filing deadline.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the absence of the Secretary's signature on the certificate filed by the Chairman was a "harmless irregularity" and did not render the certificate invalid. While Section 35 of the Revised Election Code prescribes the form for nomination, a departure from this form, when not used for fraudulent practices, is not fatal. The Court ruled that the amendment of the certificate, although made after the filing deadline but before the election, constituted substantial compliance with the law and effectively cured the defect (*Canceran v. COMELEC*). Furthermore, election laws regarding candidacy requirements are generally construed as directory to give effect to the will of the electorate, particularly where a candidate (Alialy) has already been elected.

The resolution of the Commission on Elections is reversed, and the petition is granted.
