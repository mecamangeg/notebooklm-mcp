I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. THE HON. L. PASICOLAN, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Pampanga (Branch II), JOSE P. INGAL and MARCELIANO CALIUAG, G.R. No. L-17365, May 31, 1961, Concepcion, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
The Republic of the Philippines instituted expropriation proceedings (Civil Case No. 763) for an estate in Pampanga, which was amended in 1956 to include Lots Nos. 2599, 2609, and 2625 [2]. These lots were alleged to be owned by Cecilia Lagman Vda. de Salas and the Salas family ("Salases") based on a decision in a separate cadastral case [2]. The Republic deposited ₱3,240.00 as the provisional value of the lots, which the Salases collected [2]. Subsequently, respondents Jose Ingal and Marceliano Caliuag ("Intervenors") intervened, claiming ownership of the lots [3]. The Salases and Intervenors eventually entered into a compromise agreement wherein the Salases transferred their rights to the Intervenors, and the Intervenors recognized the provisional payment made to the Salases as valid [3-5].

Following the compromise, the Republic filed motions praying for the delivery of possession of the lots and for the substitution of the Intervenors as party-defendants in place of the Salases [6]. Judge Pasicolan denied both motions, reasoning that the Intervenors were the real parties in interest and the original decision favoring the Salases had been vacated [6, 7]. The Republic filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Republic is entitled to the possession of the lots and the substitution of the Intervenors as defendants despite the transfer of ownership via compromise [6, 7].

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the respondent Judge's order and enjoined him to place the Republic in possession of the lots and allow the substitution of parties [8].

The Court ruled that by virtue of the compromise agreement, the Intervenors became the successors-in-interest of the Salases [9]. Since the Intervenors explicitly recognized the payment of the provisional value to the Salases as "legal and valid," they are bound by the effects of that payment [5, 10, 11]. Under Rule 69, Section 3 of the Rules of Court (now Rule 67), the collection of the provisional deposit by the landowners is a recognition of the Government's right to take possession, rendering such right "effective and executory" [11].

Consequently, the Intervenors' rights in the expropriation are limited to collecting the difference between the provisional value already paid and the just compensation to be fixed later [9]. The respondent Judge gravely abused his discretion in denying the motions, as he unlawfully excluded the Government from the use and enjoyment of a right to which it is entitled under Rule 67, Sections 1 and 3, and Rule 69, Section 3 of the Rules of Court [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, Paredes, De Leon, and Natividad concurred [12]. Justices Padilla, Barrera, and Dizon took no part [12].
