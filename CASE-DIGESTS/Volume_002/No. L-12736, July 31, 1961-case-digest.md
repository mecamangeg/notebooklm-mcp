I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO L. LAZATIN v. ANGEL C. TWAÑO and GREGORIO T. CASTRO, G.R. No. L-12736, July 31, 1961, 2 SCRA 842, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Twaño and Castro previously obtained a favorable judgment against Petitioner Lazatin in a civil case involving the sale of auto-trucks. Lazatin’s property was levied and sold to Respondents, but Lazatin exercised his right of redemption by depositing P13,849.88 with the Sheriff of Pampanga. On the same day, Lazatin filed the present action against Respondents to recover an alleged balance of P19,676.09. He secured a writ of preliminary attachment on the redemption money he had just deposited, alleging that Respondents were disposing of their property to defraud creditors. The Sheriff consequently refused to deliver the money to Respondents.

The trial court eventually dissolved the writ and dismissed Lazatin's complaint on the grounds of *res judicata* and prescription. It awarded Respondents 6% interest on the withheld money, P2,500.00 each in moral damages, and P3,000.00 in attorney's fees. Lazatin appealed to the Supreme Court, specifically questioning the award of moral damages and attorney's fees.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the attachment defendants are entitled to moral damages for the wrongful issuance of the writ of attachment.
2. W/N the award of attorney's fees is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that for an attachment defendant to recover moral damages, they must allege and establish that the writ was **maliciously sued out** [1, 2]. Under Article 2219 of the Civil Code, moral damages are recoverable in cases analogous to "malicious prosecution" [3]. The Court held that wrongful attachment is analogous to malicious prosecution, and thus requires proof of malice [2, 3]. Absent malice, an attachment defendant is entitled only to actual or compensatory damages [1, 4]. The trial court made no finding of malice on the part of Lazatin, and the dissolution of the writ was based on technical grounds [5]. Consequently, the award of moral damages was improper.

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the award of attorney's fees, citing Article 2208, paragraph 11 of the Civil Code, which allows recovery "where the court deems it just and equitable" [6, 7]. Although the Court rejected the lower court's finding that the action was "clearly unfounded" (which would imply bad faith), it held that it was just and equitable to award fees because the Respondents were drawn into litigation by Lazatin and were compelled to hire counsel to defend their rights [7].

**Disposition:** The decision appealed from is MODIFIED with the elimination of moral damages, and AFFIRMED in all other respects.
