I. CAPTION
LUIS SARABIA AND JOSE LEIDO v. THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, THE DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES and FRANCISCO B. LARDIZABAL, G.R. No. L-16002, May 23, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On August 27, 1951, petitioners Sarabia and Leido filed fishpond applications with the Bureau of Fisheries. Respondent Lardizabal filed a similar application on July 16, 1952. The Director of Fisheries adjudicated 50 hectares each to Sarabia and Leido, rejecting Lardizabal's application [1, 2]. Lardizabal appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources (SANR), who issued an order on August 22, 1955, modifying the Director's decision by reducing petitioners' areas to 33-1/3 hectares each and awarding the remaining portion to Lardizabal [3].

Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with the CFI of Manila (Civil Case No. 28932) to annul the SANR's order. The trial court dismissed the petition because petitioners failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not appealing to the President, and because appeal, not certiorari, was the proper remedy [3, 4]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-11107), but the appeal was dismissed for being filed out of time [4]. Subsequently, on January 16, 1959, petitioners filed a petition for prohibition with the CFI of Manila (Civil Case No. 38988) on the same grounds. The trial court dismissed this second petition on the ground of *res judicata* [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for prohibition is barred by *res judicata* due to the dismissal of the prior petition for certiorari.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The dismissal of the prior certiorari case based on the failure to exhaust administrative remedies was tantamount to a dismissal based on the petitioners' lack of a cause of action [7, 8]. Such dismissal was a dismissal on the merits, and since the petitioners' appeal to the Supreme Court was dismissed for being filed out of time, the judgment became final and constitutes *res judicata* in all subsequent suits on the same points [8].

The Court held that a party cannot escape the effects of *res judicata* by varying the form of action or adopting a different method of presenting the case [9-11]. Although the present petition is for prohibition and the former was for certiorari, they raised exactly the same cause of action and sought the same relief: the nullification of the SANR decision [8, 12].

Judgment affirmed [13].
