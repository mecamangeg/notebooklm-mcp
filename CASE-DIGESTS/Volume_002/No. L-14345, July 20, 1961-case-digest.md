I. CAPTION
FAUSTINO LAGRIMAS v. JUSTICE OF THE PEACE OF CAMILING, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14345, July 20, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Faustino Lagrimas and Fortunato Patayan executed a "Contract of Lease of Real Property" in 1953, where Lagrimas leased land for three years at an annual rental of 57 cavanes of palay. They also signed a separate "Agreement of Tenancy" intended to commence after the lease expired in 1957. In December 1954, Lagrimas failed to pay the full rental balance and returned possession of the property to Patayan, who accepted Lagrimas' son-in-law as the new tenant. Patayan subsequently filed Civil Case No. 217 in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Camiling solely for the collection of the unpaid rentals (26 cavanes). Lagrimas was declared in default, and the JP Court rendered judgment for Patayan. A writ of execution was issued, resulting in the sale of Lagrimas' lands. Later, Patayan's heirs filed a motion for contempt against Lagrimas for allegedly re-entering the sold properties. Lagrimas filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Tarlac, arguing the JP Court lacked jurisdiction because the case involved a tenancy relationship. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling the case was a collection suit, not a tenancy dispute.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Justice of the Peace Court had jurisdiction over the case.
2. W/N the petitioner's re-entry into the properties sold on execution constitutes contempt of court.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed that the contract between the parties was clearly one of lease of real property, not tenancy. The "Agreement of Tenancy" relied upon by the petitioner was intended for a future period (1957–1960) and was never enforced because the petitioner returned the property in 1954, effectively rescinding both contracts. Since Civil Case No. 217 was an ordinary action to recover the value of unpaid rentals—an amount well within the jurisdictional limit of inferior courts—the Justice of the Peace Court properly exercised jurisdiction and did not abuse its discretion [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The Court held that in actions other than those for forcible entry or detainer, a re-entry by the judgment debtor into property sold in an ordinary execution sale does not constitute contempt of court. Instead, such an act gives the purchaser or his heirs a cause of action for a separate suit for forcible entry against the debtor. Consequently, the contempt proceedings in the JP Court were improper [3].

The decision appealed from is **MODIFIED**; the dismissal regarding jurisdiction is affirmed, but the contempt proceedings are ordered discontinued.
