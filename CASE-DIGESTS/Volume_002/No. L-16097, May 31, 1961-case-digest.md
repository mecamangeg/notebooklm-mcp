I. CAPTION
LUIS ALMEDA v. ANASTACIA MANRILLA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16097, May 31, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellant Luis Almeda filed an action for reconveyance of Lot No. 4695 of the Calamba Friar Lands Estate against defendants-appellees Anastacia Manrilla, et al. Almeda claimed he inherited the lot from his father, Catalino, who had possessed it since 1930. Manrilla, widow of Marcelino Odpaga, asserted that Odpaga purchased the lot from the government and was issued Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-11791 in 1957.

The defendants raised the defense of *res judicata*, citing a previous case (Civil Case No. B-142) involving the exact same parties, subject matter, and cause of action (ownership based on inheritance vs. purchase), where the appeal was dismissed and the decision became final. The only difference was the relief sought: cancellation of title in the first case versus reconveyance in the present case. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground of *res judicata* and on the merits, ordering Almeda to vacate the land.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the present action for reconveyance is barred by *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the present action is barred by the principle of *res judicata*. A comparison with the former case (Civil Case No. B-142) revealed that the judgment was on the merits, final, and rendered by a court with jurisdiction. Furthermore, there was identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action. The Court held that although the reliefs prayed for were not the same (cancellation of title vs. reconveyance), *res judicata* still applies because both remedies arose from the same cause of action [1]. The Court cited *Juan v. Go Co Tay* and Section 44, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court [1]. On the merits, the Court also affirmed that the evidence supported the defendants' ownership via the validly issued title [2].

Decision affirmed.
