I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. EFREN MIRANDA, G.R. No. L-16122, May 30, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Efren A. Miranda, the postmaster of Cantillan, Surigao, was charged with malversation of public funds through falsification of public documents for allegedly altering records to misappropriate P3,684.81 between 1955 and 1956 [1]. On August 21, 1959, Miranda filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that he had reimbursed the missing amount within 24 hours of discovery, which supposedly negated criminal intent and extinguished his liability [2]. He further argued that prosecuting him was discriminatory because another government employee who committed a similar offense was not prosecuted after making restitution [3].

The Court of First Instance of Surigao dismissed the case, ruling that the return of funds before the filing of the information meant no crime was committed, erroneously citing *People v. Tolentino*. The trial court also cited "fairness" against the alleged discrimination [3-5]. The prosecution moved for reconsideration, arguing that the charge included falsification which is not negated by reimbursement, but the motion was denied [5]. The government appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the return of the malversed funds before the filing of the information extinguishes criminal liability.
2. W/N the dismissal of the information on the grounds of lack of criminal intent and alleged discrimination was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that in malversation of public funds, payment, indemnification, or reimbursement of the amounts misappropriated after the commission of the crime affects only the civil liability of the offender but does not extinguish criminal liability [6]. The crime is a public offense that must be prosecuted by the Government, even if complete reparation is made. The Court cited established jurisprudence, including *People v. Benitez* and *U.S. v. Mendezona*, to support this principle [6].

2. **NO.** The dismissal was improper and premature. First, Miranda's claims that the return of funds negated criminal intent and that the falsifications were "honest mistakes" are mere defenses that must be proven during trial, not grounds for a motion to dismiss/quash before the prosecution has presented evidence [7]. Second, the neglect, laxity, or complacency of government officials in failing to prosecute another erring employee does not justify dismissing the criminal action against the accused [8]. Finally, even if malversation liability were extinguished, the information also charged falsification of public documents, a separate offense which remained valid [9].

The order of dismissal was **REVERSED** and set aside, and the lower court was ordered to proceed with the trial on the merits [10].
