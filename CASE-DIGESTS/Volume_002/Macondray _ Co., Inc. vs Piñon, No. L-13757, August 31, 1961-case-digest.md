I. CAPTION
SEBASTIAN COSCOLLUELA v. TRANQUILINO H. VALDERRAMA, G.R. No. L-13757, August 31, 1961, 2 SCRA 1096, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellee Sebastian Coscolluela, owner of the Escos Lumber Mill and a timber concession in Negros Occidental, was in financial distress. On October 11, 1952, he entered into a contract (Exhibit F) with defendant-appellant Tranquilino Valderrama. Under this agreement, Coscolluela ceded 70% of his rights and interests in the mill and concession to Valderrama, who was to manage the operations and form a new corporation (Valco Lumber Co.) to carry on the business. Valderrama took possession and appointed Coscolluela as Superintendent.

However, the Bureau of Forestry rejected the renewal of the concession license for 1952-1953 due to non-payment of fees. Instead of seeking reconsideration for the partnership, Valderrama secretly secured the license in his own name, consolidated it with his other concessions, and dismissed Coscolluela. Coscolluela filed a suit for breach of contract and damages. Valderrama argued that Exhibit F was the sole agreement and that it was invalid as the concession rights had expired. The trial court ruled in favor of Coscolluela, rescinding the contract and awarding P950,726.33 in damages. Valderrama appealed, questioning the admission of parol evidence to prove collateral agreements regarding the incorporation.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N parol evidence is admissible to prove the existence of collateral agreements (specifically the organization of a corporation) not explicitly stated in the written contract (Exhibit F).
2. W/N Valderrama is liable for damages for breach of contract and bad faith.
3. W/N the amount of damages awarded by the lower court was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that where the provisions of a written contract are ambiguous, and there is sufficient evidence showing the existence of collateral agreements, parol evidence is admissible to prove the real agreement of the parties. The Court found Exhibit F to be provisional and ambiguous, particularly regarding the payment of debts. It was proven that Valderrama's counsel had already drafted Articles of Incorporation for "Valco" (Valderrama-Coscolluela), confirming the intent to incorporate. Furthermore, since Valderrama's counsel drafted the contract, any ambiguity must be construed against him.

2. **YES.** Valderrama was guilty of bad faith. He violated the trust reposed in him by acquiring the concession exclusively for himself after the renewal application was rejected, without informing Coscolluela or attempting to cure the defect for their joint benefit. His subsequent dismissal of Coscolluela and refusal to incorporate the business constituted a clear breach of their agreement, entitling Coscolluela to damages under the Civil Code.

3. **NO.** The Supreme Court modified the damages awarded.
    *   **Unrealized Profits:** The award of P350,000 for the value of the concession rights was deleted. The concession belongs to the State, and the concessionaire is merely a lessee; damages can only be recovered for proven probable profits, which were not established in this case.
    *   **Mill Equipment:** The valuation of the mill's assets was reduced to 25% of the book value (approx. P75,000) to account for depreciation and wear, as opposed to the full acquisition cost awarded by the trial court.
    *   **Moral and Exemplary Damages:** The award was reduced from P300,000 to P20,000 for moral damages and P20,000 for exemplary damages, deemed sufficient to penalize Valderrama's bad faith.

The judgment of the lower court was **MODIFIED** regarding the amount of damages but affirmed in all other respects.
