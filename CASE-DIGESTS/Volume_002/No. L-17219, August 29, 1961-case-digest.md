I. CAPTION
SOUTHWESTERN SUGAR & MOLASSES (FAR EAST), INC. v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and SERAPIO D. VELASCO, G.R. No. L-17219, August 29, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On October 2, 1959, Serapio D. Velasco filed a complaint against Southwestern Sugar & Molasses (Far East), Inc. with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) seeking P3,834.65 in overtime pay and attorney's fees [1]. The company moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of a prior amicable settlement and lack of jurisdiction [1]. The CIR, through Judge Bugayong and affirmed *en banc*, denied the motion to dismiss, upholding its authority to hear the case [2-4]. The company petitioned the Supreme Court for review [2]. It is undisputed that Velasco was no longer an employee of the company, did not seek reinstatement, and his separation was not due to unfair labor practice [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over a money claim for overtime pay when the employer-employee relationship has terminated and the employee does not seek reinstatement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) lacks jurisdiction. The Court reiterated the principle established in *Price Stabilization Corporation v. Court of Industrial Relations* (G.R. No. L-13806, May 23, 1960), stating that the CIR only has jurisdiction over claims arising from employment (such as those under the Minimum Wage Law and Eight-Hour Labor Law) when the employer-employee relationship still exists or is sought to be reestablished through reinstatement [5, 6]. When the relationship has been terminated and no reinstatement is sought, such demands become mere money claims that fall within the jurisdiction of the regular courts [5].

The petition is **GRANTED**. The Resolution of the CIR is declared null and void, and the complaint is dismissed [7].
