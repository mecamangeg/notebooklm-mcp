I. CAPTION
SANTIAGO MERCADO v. ELIZALDE & COMPANY, INC. and MANUEL PALACIO, G.R. No. L-12654, May 31, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Santiago Mercado filed a complaint for differential and overtime pay against respondents Elizalde & Company, Inc. and its Branch Manager before the Wage Administration Service (WAS) in Cebu City [1]. Upon notice, respondents explicitly refused to submit the case for arbitration [1]. The Regional Labor Inspector proceeded with the investigation, noting it was "administrative in nature" solely to determine if the case should be indorsed to the fiscal for criminal prosecution [1, 2]. Petitioner’s counsel agreed to this limited purpose [2].

Despite the lack of an arbitration agreement, the Inspector rendered a decision ordering respondents to pay P9,508.60 [3]. After respondents' petition for certiorari was dismissed by the Supreme Court without prejudice to action in the lower court, Mercado filed a special proceeding in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu to enforce the WAS decision [3, 4]. Respondents filed a "Special Appearance" questioning the procedure [4]. The CFI treated this as a motion to dismiss and dismissed the proceeding, ruling that the WAS decision was void *ab initio* because the agency lacked jurisdiction absent an agreement to arbitrate [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Wage Administration Service (WAS) decision awarding money claims is valid despite the respondents' refusal to arbitrate.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. Under the Minimum Wage Law and Section 9 of the Code of Rules and Regulations of the Wage Administration Service, the WAS may only hear and decide claims if the parties agree in writing to submit the case for arbitration [7]. Where mediation fails and parties are unwilling to arbitrate, Section 14 mandates that the WAS only investigate to find if the claim is meritorious for the purpose of preparing a complaint for court action or referring it to the fiscal [8].

In this case, the respondents expressly refused to arbitrate, and the investigation was conducted solely for the "criminal aspect" [9]. Consequently, the Inspector had no jurisdiction to render a binding decision on the money claim, making the award void *ab initio* [10]. The Court distinguished this from *Brillantes v. Castro*, where parties had agreed to arbitrate [11]. Since the WAS decision was a nullity, there was nothing for the CFI to enforce, and the dismissal of the petition was proper [6].

**Petition DENIED. Decision AFFIRMED.**
