I. CAPTION
ANGELINA ARANETA VDA. DE LIBOON, in her own behalf and as mother and guardian ad litem of JUAN LIBOON, JR. and VICTORIA LIBOON v. LUZON STEVEDORING CO., INC., G.R. No. L-14893, May 31, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Juan Liboon y Mallorca was a stevedore-foreman for the defendant who retired due to old age after 21 years of service. On October 31, 1955, the defendant granted him retirement benefits totaling P7,350.00, payable at P175.00 per month for 42 months ending April 30, 1957. The agreement expressly stipulated that should Juan die before April 30, 1957, the monthly payments would stop, and neither his estate nor his beneficiaries would have further claims against the company.

Juan died on September 2, 1954. The company paid a total of P4,200.00 to Juan and his beneficiaries but refused to pay the remaining balance. Juan’s widow, Angelina Araneta Vda. de Liboon, and their minor children filed a collection suit in the Court of First Instance of Manila, arguing the condition terminating benefits upon death was contrary to law, morals, and public policy. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss, which the lower court granted.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the mother may sue on behalf of her minor children despite the lack of a formal appointment as guardian *ad litem*.
2. W/N the stipulation that pension benefits cease upon the death of the retiree is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The lack of a formal appointment designating the mother as the minors’ guardian *ad litem* may be overlooked. Under Articles 316 and 317 of the Civil Code, it is the duty of parents to represent their children in actions that redound to their benefit. Since the mother's capacity to sue was not questioned and the court impliedly allowed her representation, the procedural defect is not fatal [1].

2. **YES.** The condition is valid. The pension benefit was granted by the employer out of generosity and as a reward for the employee's long and faithful service. The stipulation that benefits would cease upon the grantee's death is not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy. The employer cannot be compelled to go beyond its understanding or obligation regarding a gratuity [2, 3].

**Order affirmed.**
