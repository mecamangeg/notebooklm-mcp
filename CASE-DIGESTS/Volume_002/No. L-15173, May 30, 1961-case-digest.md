I. CAPTION
PARSONS HARDWARE CO., INC. v. DELA RAMA STEAMSHIP CO., INC. and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-15173, May 30, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Parsons Hardware Co., Inc. (Plaintiff) ordered 302 rubber pneumatic tires and tubes from the USA, shipped aboard the SS "Maron" which arrived in Manila in April 1957. Upon delivery, twelve (12) tires valued at P1,509.91 were missing. Parsons Hardware filed a suit against Dela Rama Steamship Co. (agent of the vessel) and Manila Railroad Company (Appellant), the operator of the arrastre service doing business as Manila Port Service.

Manila Railroad Company denied liability, invoking Section 15 of its Management Contract with the Bureau of Customs. It argued that it was released from liability because Parsons Hardware failed to file a claim within fifteen (15) days from the discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel. The last package was discharged on April 9, 1957. Parsons Hardware had filed a "notice of missing or unlocated cargoes" on April 15, 1957, but the formal claim was only filed on April 25, 1957. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Parsons Hardware, prompting this appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the filing of a "notice of missing or unlocated cargoes" within fifteen (15) days from discharge constitutes sufficient compliance with the claim requirement of the Management Contract.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. While the trial court failed to make a specific finding on the Appellant's defense regarding the claim period, the evidence showed that the last package was discharged on April 9, 1957, and Parsons Hardware filed a "notice of missing or unlocated cargoes" on April 15, 1957.

The Court held that this notice, filed within the fifteen-day period prescribed by Section 15 of the Management Contract, constituted **sufficient compliance** with the requirement for the demandability of liability for lost goods. The fact that the formal claim was filed later (April 25, 1957) did not bar recovery since the earlier notice served the purpose of the provision.

**Decision affirmed.**
