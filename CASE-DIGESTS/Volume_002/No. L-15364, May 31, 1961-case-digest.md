I. CAPTION
VIRGINIA CLAREZA, ET AL. and FELIPE J. ZAMORA v. BENJAMIN A. ROSALES and AMADO A. DIMAYUGA, G.R. No. L-15364, May 31, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Virginia Clareza and her children filed a suit for damages against Benjamin Rosales and Amado Dimayuga for the death of Juan Luno (Clareza’s husband), a taxi driver who died in a collision caused by Rosales’ negligence [1]. Felipe J. Zamora, the owner of the taxi and Luno's employer, filed a motion to intervene or be substituted as plaintiff [2]. Zamora alleged that he had paid P4,000.00 to Luno's heirs under the Workmen’s Compensation Act and was thus subrogated to their rights against the defendants [2]. The defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that since the plaintiffs had already recovered compensation from Zamora, they had no remaining cause of action, and consequently, there was no basis for intervention [3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed both the complaint and the complaint in intervention [4]. Zamora appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the employer who paid workmen's compensation may be substituted as party plaintiff in the action against the tortfeasors.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court set aside the order of dismissal and allowed the substitution. While the Court acknowledged that intervention is merely ancillary to an existing litigation and ceases when the original plaintiff's rights cease [5], [6], it held that the employer may be substituted as party plaintiff under Section 20, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court regarding transfer of interest [7].

The Court applied Section 6 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, which provides that an employer who pays compensation "shall succeed the injured employee to the right of recovery from such person what he paid" [8], [9]. Since Zamora specifically prayed to be allowed to substitute the plaintiffs and amended the complaint to reflect this subrogation, the substitution should be allowed to subserve the policy of avoiding multiplicity of suits [10], [7]. The case was returned to the lower court for further proceedings [11].
