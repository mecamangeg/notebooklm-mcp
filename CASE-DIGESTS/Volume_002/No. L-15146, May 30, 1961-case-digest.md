I. CAPTION
MARY DE LA PEÑA, In Behalf of the Minor TERESITA LIM v. PENG HUAN LIM, G.R. No. L-15146, May 30, 1961, Natividad, J.

II. FACTS
Mary de la Peña filed an action for acknowledgment and support in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental on behalf of her minor daughter, Teresita Lim, against defendant Peng Huan Lim [1]. She alleged that she and the defendant lived together as husband and wife without the benefit of marriage, resulting in the birth of Teresita, whom the defendant initially supported but later abandoned [2], [3]. The defendant denied the allegations and raised the affirmative defense that the plaintiff lacked legal capacity to sue [4]. The CFI dismissed the complaint and the defendant's counterclaim, ruling that the plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence to substantiate her allegations [4]. The plaintiff appealed directly to the Supreme Court, raising issues regarding her legal capacity to sue and the trial court's appreciation of the evidence and credibility of witnesses [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review an appeal that raises both questions of law and of fact.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that where an appeal raises issues of both law and fact, the review of the judgment rendered by the trial court falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals pursuant to Section 17, paragraph 3(5) of the Judiciary Act [6], [7]. The Court observed that while the appeal raised a question of law regarding the plaintiff's legal capacity, it also raised an issue essentially of fact regarding the sufficiency of evidence [7]. Citing *Estrada v. Noble*, *Ramos v. People’s Surety*, and *Masangcay v. Valencia*, the Court ruled it could not decide the case on the merits [7].

Case certified to the Court of Appeals for proper action [8].
