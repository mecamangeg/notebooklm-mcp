I. CAPTION
JESUS T. GESOLGON, et al. v. ARSENIO H. LACSON, et al., G.R. No. L-16507, May 31, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, members of the Detective Bureau of the Manila Police Department, were dismissed by Respondent Mayor Lacson in 1952 but were reinstated by court order in 1955 and 1956. During their separation, the Mayor approved budget ordinances providing for salary increases and promotional appointments for the police force. Upon reinstatement, Petitioners were paid their old salary rates and were denied the increases granted by the ordinances. They filed a petition for mandamus. The lower court granted the petition, ruling that the salary increases were mere standardization of pay (a ministerial duty) rather than promotions, and ordered the payment of back salary increases. Respondents appealed, arguing the increases were promotions subject to discretion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the salary increases constitute a promotion requiring a new appointment.
2. W/N mandamus lies to compel the Mayor to issue the promotional appointments.
3. W/N the Petitioners are entitled to back salaries.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A salary increase is a promotion and not automatic. Under **Section 256 of the Revised Administrative Code**, a salary increase is deemed a promotion and requires an appointment to be effective [1, 2]. Furthermore, **Executive Order No. 94** classifies positions into grades; an increase in salary involves an ascent to a higher grade, which constitutes a promotion even without a change in position [3]. Therefore, enjoyment of the increase is conditioned on a promotional appointment, which is a discretionary function of the appointing power [4, 5].

2. **YES.** Mandamus lies to correct a gross abuse of discretion. While appointment is discretionary, the Mayor committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to appoint the Petitioners (except Campillo and Gonzales). The record showed Petitioners had long years of service and high efficiency ratings (above 85%), while other officers with pending or dropped charges were promoted [5, 6]. The refusal was found to be arbitrary, discriminatory, and based on considerations alien to fitness. Where there is palpable excess of authority resulting in manifest injustice, mandamus will lie (**Villanueva v. Araneta**) [7]. However, Petitioners Campillo and Gonzales were validly excluded due to efficiency ratings below 85% [5].

3. **NO.** The Court cannot order the payment of back salaries. **Section 256 of the Revised Administrative Code** explicitly provides that appointments cannot take effect prior to the date of appointment, unless approved by the Department Head for exceptional reasons [8]. To order payment of back salaries prior to the actual issuance of the appointment would impose on a co-equal branch of the government [8].

The appealed decision is **SET ASIDE**. Respondents are ordered to issue promotional appointments to the Petitioners (except Campillo and Gonzales), effective from the date of appointment [9].
