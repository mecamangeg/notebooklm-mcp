I. CAPTION
JOSE H. MENDOZA v. ANDRES ALANO and GREGORIO SALCEDO, G.R. No. L-16222, May 31, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Mendoza obtained a favorable judgment in a forcible entry and unlawful detainer case (Civil Case No. 90) against defendants Alano and Salcedo, awarding him possession of two parcels of land. The Clerk of Court issued a writ of execution commanding the defendants to vacate the premises and deliver them to the plaintiff. When the Deputy Sheriff attempted to serve the writ, the defendants refused to vacate. Consequently, Mendoza filed a motion to declare them in contempt. The Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur declared the defendants guilty of contempt under Rule 64, Section 3(b) of the Rules of Court and sentenced them to four months imprisonment. The defendants appealed, arguing the writ was unauthorized because it was directed to them rather than the sheriff.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendants are liable for contempt of court for refusing to vacate the land pursuant to the writ of execution.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the lower court's order. The judgment involved the delivery of possession of real property, which must be executed in accordance with **Section 8(d), Rule 39** of the Rules of Court. This rule requires the writ to be directed to the sheriff, authorizing the officer to place the plaintiff in possession, rather than commanding the defendants to vacate. The Clerk of Court erroneously issued a writ under Section 9 (special judgment), directed to the defendants themselves. Since the writ was invalid, there was no legal order disobeyed [1, 2].

Furthermore, the Court held, citing *Quizon v. PNB*, that a refusal to comply with a judgment ordering delivery of real property is not punishable for contempt under **Rule 64, Section 3(b)**. It is punishable under **Section 3(h)** only if the defendants re-enter or disturb possession *after* the plaintiff has already been placed in possession by the sheriff. Since the sheriff had not yet placed Mendoza in possession, the defendants could not be punished for contempt [2, 3].

**Order set aside.**
