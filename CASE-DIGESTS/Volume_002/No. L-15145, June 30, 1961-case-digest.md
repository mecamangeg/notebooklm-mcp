I. CAPTION
AURELIA T. DE PINEDA v. FELINO V. VELOIRA, G.R. No. L-15145, June 30, 1961, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff De Pineda filed a forcible entry and illegal detainer case against Defendant Veloira, which was appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal [1]. Veloira received notice that the appeal was docketed on March 25, 1958. Two days later, on March 27, 1958, he filed a Motion to Dismiss (MTD) instead of an answer [2, 3]. On May 17, 1958, the CFI denied the MTD in open court and verbally notified the parties. However, Veloira only received the written copy of the order of denial by registered mail on June 27, 1958. He filed his Answer on June 30, 1958 [4]. On that same day, the CFI declared him in default, ruling that the prescriptive period to answer had resumed from the verbal notice on May 17 and had already expired. Veloira appealed the order of default [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the period to file an answer resumes from the verbal notice of the denial of a Motion to Dismiss given in open court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the running of the period to file an answer resumes not from the date of verbal notification in open court, but from the date the defendant actually received a copy of the order of denial. Notice given orally in open court regarding the denial of a motion is not sufficient and does not constitute service under Rule 27 of the Rules of Court [5, 6].

Under Section 7 of Rule 40, the defendant has 15 days to answer from the notice of docketing. Veloira used two days before filing his MTD (March 25 to March 27), which interrupted the period (Rule 8, Sec. 4). He had 13 days remaining. Since he received the written order of denial on June 27, 1958, he had until July 10, 1958, to file his answer. His answer filed on June 30, 1958, was therefore within the reglementary period [3].

The order appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the case is remanded to the court below for further proceedings [7].
