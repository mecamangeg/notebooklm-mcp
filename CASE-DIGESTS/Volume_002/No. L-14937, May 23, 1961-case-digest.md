I. CAPTION
MAGDALENA AGUILOR, et al. v. FLORENCIO BALATICO and GREGORIO AGUILOR, G.R. No. L-14937, May 23, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Hilario Aguilor was the registered owner of a parcel of land in Cagayan. He had a daughter, Magdalena (petitioner), with his wife Fausta Unday, who died in 1918. Hilario later lived with Beatriz Asuncion, whose descendants (Ga et al.) are co-petitioners. The land originally formed part of a homestead patent issued to Juan Aguilor in 1924. In 1939, the homestead was subdivided, and a Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) for the subject lot was issued to Hilario Aguilor, described as a "widower."

On April 25, 1949, Hilario sold the land to respondents Florencio Balatico and Gregorio Aguilor for P1,000. Consequently, Hilario’s title was cancelled, and a new TCT was issued to the respondents. Petitioners filed a complaint to recover the land, alleging that it was conjugal property of Hilario and Fausta (or acquired during cohabitation with Beatriz) and that the sale was invalid. The Court of First Instance of Cagayan dismissed the complaint, ruling Hilario was the exclusive owner and the sale was valid. Petitioners appealed on questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the land was conjugal property of Hilario and Fausta (or co-owned with Beatriz) limiting Hilario's right to sell.
2. W/N the sale is void for violating the prohibition on alienation under the Public Land Act.

IV. RULING
1. **NO**. The Court ruled that the property belonged exclusively to Hilario Aguilor. Fausta Unday died in 1918, six years before the original homestead patent was issued to Juan Aguilor in 1924. Thus, the conjugal partnership had long been dissolved. Regarding Beatriz Asuncion, the titles described Hilario as a widower, negating the existence of a marriage. Furthermore, since the patent was issued in 1924, the land must have been cleared before that year, whereas Hilario only acquired his specific title to the subdivided lot in 1939. Therefore, neither the first conjugal partnership nor the subsequent cohabitation contributed to the acquisition, and Hilario, as absolute owner, validly sold the land without the petitioners' consent.

2. **NO**. The Court held that the sale was valid and not violative of Section 118 of the Public Land Act. This provision prohibits the encumbrance or alienation of homestead lands from the date of application approval and for a term of five years from the date of patent issuance. The patent in this case was issued on May 5, 1924, while the disputed sale took place on April 25, 1949—over 25 years later. The transaction was therefore well beyond the statutory prohibition period.

Decision affirmed.
