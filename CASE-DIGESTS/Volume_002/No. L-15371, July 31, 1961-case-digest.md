**I. CAPTION**
MARCELO LIWANAG v. CENTRAL AZUCARERA DON PEDRO, G.R. No. L-15371, July 31, 1961, 2 SCRA 936, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiff-appellant Marcelo Liwanag initially filed a claim for overtime, nighttime, and vacation leave pay amounting to P59,429.13 with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), which was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction [1]. On October 3, 1956, Liwanag filed the same claim with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Batangas [1].

Defendant-appellee Central Azucarera Don Pedro moved to dismiss the case, arguing that under Section 25, Article 6 of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, jurisdiction over money claims for services was exclusively conferred upon the regional offices of the Department of Labor [1]. Liwanag opposed, contending that Republic Act No. 997 did not authorize the Government Survey and Reorganization Commission to transfer judicial functions to the executive department [1, 2]. The CFI granted the motion to dismiss, and Liwanag appealed directly to the Supreme Court on a question of law [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Section 25 of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A validly divested the Court of First Instance of jurisdiction over money claims in favor of the regional offices of the Department of Labor.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that Section 25 of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, which grants regional offices of the Department of Labor exclusive and original jurisdiction over money claims, is null and void [3, 4].

Relying on the doctrine in *Corominas, Jr. v. Labor Standards Commission* and *Manila Central University v. Calupitan*, the Court held that such a grant of jurisdiction is not authorized by the provisions of Republic Act No. 997, the law creating the Government Survey and Reorganization Commission [4]. Consequently, the Commission had no authority to transfer functions of a judicial nature to the executive department [2, 4].

The order of dismissal was **set aside**, and the case was **remanded** to the lower court for further proceedings [5].
