I. CAPTION
MIGUEL DE LOS SANTOS v. DR. FRANCISCO QUISUMBING, G.R. No. L-15376, June 30, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Miguel de los Santos filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against his former employer, Dr. Francisco Quisumbing, seeking to recover P11,221.08 for overtime services rendered as a taximeter mechanic [1]. De los Santos alleged he worked 12 hours daily, including Sundays and holidays, which exceeded the hours provided by Commonwealth Act No. 444 [1]. Quisumbing denied the claim, alleging he never consented to overtime work, that the plaintiff was fully paid, and that the claim had prescribed [2]. The CFI ruled in favor of De los Santos, awarding him P2,000.00 [3]. Quisumbing appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA) [4]. The CA, however, certified the case to the Supreme Court, believing it lacked jurisdiction over overtime claims under C.A. No. 444, citing 1958 jurisprudence which suggested such cases belonged to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [4]. At the time the complaint was filed, the employer-employee relationship had already terminated, and De los Santos did not seek reinstatement [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the regular courts have jurisdiction over a money claim for overtime pay where the employer-employee relationship has terminated and no reinstatement is sought.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the regular courts have jurisdiction. The Court clarified the prevailing rule citing *Price Stabilization Corp. v. CIR* and *NASSCO v. CIR*: where the employer-employee relationship is still existing or is sought to be reestablished (e.g., reinstatement), the CIR has jurisdiction over claims arising from employment such as the Eight-Hour Labor Law [6, 7]. However, after the termination of the relationship and where no reinstatement is sought, such claims become mere money claims properly cognizable by the regular courts [7]. Since De los Santos was no longer employed by Quisumbing and did not seek reinstatement, the CFI had jurisdiction [5]. As the issues on appeal were dominantly factual, the case was remanded to the Court of Appeals for determination on the merits [5, 8].
