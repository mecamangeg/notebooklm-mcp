I. CAPTION
LUCIANO VALENCIA and FRANCISCA OCAMPO v. HON. JOSE T. SURTIDA, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur, and RUFINA SUBASTIL, G.R. No. L-17277, May 31, 1961, 2 SCRA 622, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On February 14, 1959, respondent Rufina Subastil filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Sur against petitioners Luciano Valencia and Francisca Ocampo. Subastil alleged that she was the owner of a riceland which petitioners cultivated under a verbal tenancy contract since 1950. She claimed petitioners failed to pay the agreed rental of five cavans of palay per agricultural year after the 1950-1951 season and refused to vacate the land. She prayed for their ejectment and payment of damages.

Petitioners failed to file an answer and were declared in default. The CFI rendered judgment finding that petitioners were tenants of the agricultural land and ordered them to vacate and pay P400.00. Petitioners moved for reconsideration, arguing that the CFI lacked jurisdiction as the case fell under the exclusive competence of the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR), but the motion was denied. Petitioners then filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over an ejectment case involving agricultural tenants.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the ejectment of tenants of agricultural land is beyond the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance [1].

Under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 1199, all cases involving the dispossession of a tenant by the landholder or disputes arising from their relationship fall under the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the court authorized by law to take cognizance of tenancy relations [1]. Furthermore, Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1267 vests the Court of Agrarian Relations with original and exclusive jurisdiction over controversies involving relationships in the cultivation and use of agricultural land [2]. Since the respondent Judge himself found that the petitioners were tenants of agricultural land, the case falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations [1].

The Court also rejected the argument that R.A. 1199 does not apply to tenancy relations created before its enactment. Laws enacted in the exercise of police power, such as R.A. 1199, may constitutionally affect tenancy relations created prior to their effectivity [3].

The decision of the Court of First Instance is ANNULLED [4].
