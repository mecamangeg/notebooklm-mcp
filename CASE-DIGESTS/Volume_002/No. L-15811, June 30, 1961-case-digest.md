I. CAPTION
IN RE: PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME. JUAN MANUEL, ET AL., petitioners-appellees, vs. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, oppositor-appellant., G.R. No. L-15811, June 30, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Juan Manuel and his children (Alexander, Gloria, Jack, and Victor) filed a petition to change their surname from "Manuel" to "Eaton," the surname of Juan's alleged natural father, John Eaton [1]. Juan admitted in his petition that he had always used the name "Juan Manuel" and only signified his intention to adopt the surname "Eaton" in 1958, after the death of his alleged father [2]. There was no evidence that John Eaton had acknowledged Juan or acquiesced to Juan's use of the surname "Eaton" [2]. The Supreme Court initially denied the petition in a decision promulgated on March 27, 1961, holding that an unacknowledged natural child cannot use the putative father's surname [1]. Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the ruling in *Valencia vs. Rodriguez* allows an unacknowledged natural child to use the natural father's surname [3]. The Republic, as oppositor-appellant, had failed to assign the lower court's granting of the petition as an error in its brief [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N an unacknowledged natural child may use the surname of the natural father.
2. W/N the Supreme Court may consider an error regarding the granting of the petition even if the appellant failed to assign it as an error in their brief.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Article 366 of the New Civil Code, a natural child may only use the father's surname if he is acknowledged by both parents; otherwise, he shall employ only the surname of the recognizing parent [3, 6, 7]. The Court held that the doctrine in *Valencia vs. Rodriguez* is inapplicable because it was decided before the effectivity of the New Civil Code and involved a father who acquiesced to the use of his surname [2, 8]. In this case, there was no acknowledgment or acquiescence by the putative father [2].

2. **YES.** Under Section 5 of Rule 53 of the old Rules of Court (now Sec. 5, Rule 51), the Court may take notice of a plain error even if it was not assigned by the appellant [4, 5]. The granting of the petition for change of name despite the lack of acknowledgment was considered a plain error that the Court could properly pass upon [5].

The Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED [5].
