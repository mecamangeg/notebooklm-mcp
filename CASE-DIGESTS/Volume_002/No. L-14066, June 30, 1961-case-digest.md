I. CAPTION
VENANCIO CASTAÑEDA, ET AL. v. PASTOR D. AGO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14066, June 30, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellees Castañeda et al. filed an action to recover machinery and money from defendant-appellant Ago, stemming from a logging business agreement [1]. On August 14, 1956, neither Ago nor his counsel appeared for trial, leading the trial court to allow plaintiffs to present evidence *ex parte* [2]. On May 30, 1957, the trial court rendered a decision in favor of the plaintiffs [3].

Appellant filed a Motion for Reconsideration on July 1, 1957, claiming excusable negligence because the notice of trial was sent to his former counsel, Atty. Mariano Yap, rather than his intended new counsel, Atty. Cupin, due to a clerk's error [2]. However, this motion was not accompanied by an affidavit of merits [4]. Seven months later, on February 1, 1958, Appellant filed an Amended Motion for Reconsideration attached with affidavits attempting to prove a valid defense, specifically that the contract had been cancelled [5]. The lower court denied both motions, ruling that the original was patently defective and the amended motion was filed beyond the reglementary period [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court erred in denying the motions for reconsideration and new trial.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. The Court held that service of the notice of trial was proper because it was received by Atty. Yap, who was still one of the attorneys of record, as no withdrawal of appearance had been filed by his law firm or himself [7].

Furthermore, the Court ruled that the original motion for reconsideration was fatally defective for two reasons: (1) it did not sufficiently prove the alleged accident, mistake, or excusable negligence; and (2) it was not supported by an affidavit of merits showing a good and valid defense [8]. The Appellant's attempt to cure this defect by filing an amended motion seven months later was rejected because it was filed too late [8]. As the plaintiffs' evidence remained uncontradicted, the judgment in their favor was proper [9].

Decision affirmed [10].
