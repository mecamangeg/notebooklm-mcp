**I. CAPTION**
**THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. MANUEL B. PINEDA as one of the heirs of the deceased ATANASIO PINEDA**, G.R. No. L-14522, May 31, 1961, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
Atanasio Pineda died on May 23, 1945. His estate proceedings were closed on June 8, 1948. Years later, the BIR investigated and found no income tax returns filed for the estate for 1945-1948. On January 29, 1951, a BIR examiner filed returns for the estate based on available data. Assessments were issued in August 1951, which respondent Manuel Pineda (an heir) contested. On August 24, 1953, Pineda filed returns for the estate for 1945-1947. Revised assessments were issued on October 19, 1953. The BIR also demanded payment for residence tax for 1945 and real estate dealer's tax for 1946-1947. Pineda appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), arguing prescription. The CTA ruled that the government's right to collect the taxes had prescribed, noting that the judicial action (deemed filed on August 7, 1957) was beyond the five-year period from the filing of returns or assessments.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the government's right to assess and collect income taxes for 1945 and 1946 has prescribed.
2. W/N the government's right to assess and collect income tax for 1947 has prescribed.
3. W/N the government's right to collect real estate dealer's tax and residence tax has prescribed.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** For 1945, no return was filed by the estate; the first return was filed by the examiner in 1951. For 1946, the return filed by the widow was in her personal name and did not reference the estate; thus, it did not trigger the prescriptive period for the estate. Under **Sections 331 and 332 of the Tax Code**, the period for assessment/collection is computed from the returns filed by the examiner (Jan 29, 1951) or the respondent (Aug 24, 1953). Since the revised assessment was issued on Oct 19, 1953, and the judicial action began on Aug 7, 1957, the government's right has not prescribed [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The widow filed the 1947 return specifically "for and in behalf of the Estate." This return was valid for assessment purposes. Since it was filed on March 1, 1948, the five-year period under **Section 331** expired in 1953. The revised assessment issued on October 19, 1953, was beyond the five-year period and is therefore void. The prior assessment made within the period had been cancelled and superseded [3-5].

3. **NO.** No returns were filed for these specific taxes. Under **Section 332(a) of the Tax Code**, a court proceeding for collection may be begun without assessment within ten years after the discovery of the omission to file a return. The discovery occurred in 1951; the action instituted in 1957 is well within the ten-year period [5, 6].

**Decision modified.** The decision is reversed regarding 1945-1946 income taxes and other taxes, and affirmed regarding the 1947 income tax. Case remanded to the CTA for determination of remaining issues [6].
