I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MODESTO MALABANAN Y ARANDIA, G.R. No. L-16478, August 31, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Modesto Malabanan, a bus driver, was charged in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Laguna with "double serious physical injuries with damage to property thru reckless imprudence" [1]. On January 20, 1957, in Biñan, Laguna, Malabanan's bus collided with a jeepney, causing serious physical injuries to the jeepney driver and a passenger, and property damage to the jeepney amounting to P3,000.00 [2, 3]. The CFI found Malabanan guilty and sentenced him to pay a fine of P8,000.00 [4]. Malabanan appealed, challenging the CFI's jurisdiction [5]. He argued that under *Lapuz v. Court of Appeals*, the jurisdiction should lie with the Justice of the Peace Court because the penalty for the "graver" offense of physical injuries (arresto mayor) fell within the lower court's jurisdiction [5, 6]. The Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court due to the jurisdictional issue raised [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over a complex crime of reckless imprudence resulting in physical injuries and damage to property, where the penalty for the physical injuries falls under the lower court but the fine for property damage falls under the CFI.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that jurisdiction is determined by the fine imposable for the damage to property, not the penalty for the physical injuries [7, 8]. The Information cannot be split into two separate charges for damages and physical injuries [8]. Relying on *Angeles v. Jose* and *People v. Villanueva*, the Court reasoned that if the charge were solely for damage to property (P3,000.00), the fine would inevitably fall within the CFI's jurisdiction [8, 9]. It would be absurd to hold that the lower court has jurisdiction over the complex crime (injuries plus damage) when the CFI would have jurisdiction over the simple offense of damage to property alone [9]. Furthermore, if the prosecution failed to prove the injuries but established the damage, the lower court would lack jurisdiction to impose the corresponding fine [10].

The case was **REMANDED** to the Court of Appeals for determination and disposition of the remaining factual issues [11].
