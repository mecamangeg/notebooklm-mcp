I. CAPTION
DIRECTOR OF LANDS v. LELITA JUGADO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14702, May 23, 1961, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
On May 4, 1954, a Homestead Patent was issued to respondent Lelita Jugado covering a parcel of land in Himamaylan, Negros Occidental. On December 5, 1956, the petitioner Director of Lands filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental to cancel the patent, alleging it was fraudulently issued due to a prior subsisting application by one Conrada Villavera.

The Philippine National Bank (PNB) intervened as a mortgagee in good faith and moved to dismiss the petition. PNB argued that since more than one year had elapsed from the issuance of the patent, the title had become perfect and indefeasible. The CFI granted the motion and dismissed the petition. The Director of Lands appealed, contending that the one-year prescriptive period under Section 38 of Act 496 should not apply to the homestead patent in this instance.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Director of Lands can institute an action to cancel a homestead patent after the lapse of one year from its issuance.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that once a patent is registered and the corresponding certificate of title is issued, the land ceases to be part of the public domain and becomes private property subject to the safeguards of **Act 496** (Land Registration Act). **Section 38 of Act 496** prohibits raising any question concerning the validity of a certificate of title after one year from the entry of the decree of registration. In the case of public land grants, this one-year period begins from the issuance of the patent (*Sumail v. CFI of Cotabato*; *Nelayan v. Nelayan*). Since the patent was issued in May 1954 and the petition was filed only in December 1956, the Director of Lands no longer had the right to contest its validity.

Furthermore, while **Section 101 of Commonwealth Act 141** provides a remedy for the reversion of fraudulently awarded public lands, it explicitly requires that such actions be instituted by the **Solicitor General** in the name of the **Republic of the Philippines**. As the petitioner here is the Director of Lands and not the Republic, the action cannot prosper.

The order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED**, without prejudice to the Government's right to institute the proper action for reversion.
