I. CAPTION
AMANDA TRIGAL, MANUEL T. PAZ, ET AL. v. SABINA TOBIAS, as Administratrix of the trusteeship of AURELIO REYES and MARIANO V. TAJONERA, G.R. No. L-15869, August 31, 1961, 112 Phil. 1154, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants, heirs of Fermin Paz, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Manila on December 21, 1948, seeking to annul the tax sale of two parcels of land (TCT No. 23783) originally owned by Paz. The properties were sold at public auction to Aurelio Reyes for tax delinquency and subsequently transferred to defendant Mariano V. Tajonera. Plaintiffs alleged the sale was void *ab initio* due to lack of notice to the deceased owner or his heirs, and failure to comply with publication and posting requirements.

Defendants moved to dismiss on grounds of *res judicata*, citing a February 27, 1943 Land Registration Court order which cancelled Paz's title and issued a new one to Reyes based on the auction sale. They also alleged lack of jurisdiction because plaintiffs failed to allege compliance with Section 77 of R.A. No. 1837 (requiring deposit of the tax amount sold plus interest). The lower court dismissed the complaint, ruling the 1943 order constituted *res judicata*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action is barred by *res judicata* due to the 1943 registration order.
2. W/N the action to annul the tax sale has prescribed.
3. W/N the trial court lacks jurisdiction due to the failure to allege compliance with the deposit requirement under Sec. 77 of R.A. No. 1837.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The validity of the public auction sale was not put in issue when the court issued the 1943 order. That order merely cancelled the old title and issued a new one based on the purchaser's petition. Plaintiffs alleged the tax sale was made without notice, publication, or posting. If these allegations are true, the tax sale is void *ab initio*, meaning the 1943 order was entered without jurisdiction and cannot be invoked as a basis for *res judicata* [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The complaint asserts that statutory requirements for the tax sale were not observed, rendering the sale void *ab initio*. Under Article 1410 of the New Civil Code and established jurisprudence (*Eugenio v. Perdido*), an action to set aside a contract which is void *ab initio* does not prescribe [3].

3. **NO.** While Sec. 77 prohibits courts from entertaining suits assailing tax sales without the required payment into court, the mere failure to allege compliance or attach a receipt in the complaint does not prove payment was not made. Since the court entertained the complaint, the presumption is that legal requirements were fulfilled. It is incumbent upon defendants to prove non-compliance during trial [4].

The Order of dismissal is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED to the lower court for further proceedings.
