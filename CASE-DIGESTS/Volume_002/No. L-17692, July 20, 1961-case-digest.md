I. CAPTION
KAISAHAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA SA LA CAMPANA (KKM) v. HON. HERMOGENES CALUAG, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-17692, July 20, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner union (KKM) obtained a final order from the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) in 1957 directing La Campana Starch and Coffee Factory and its administrator, Ricardo Tantongco, to reinstate certain employees and pay P65,534.01 in back wages [1, 2]. After the respondents failed to comply and the Supreme Court denied their previous petition to stop contempt proceedings (G.R. No. L-13119), the CIR issued another writ of execution on March 8, 1960 [2].

To prevent the enforcement of this writ, Tantongco and La Campana Food Products, Inc. filed an action for prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon City, presided by respondent Judge Caluag [2]. KKM moved to dismiss the CFI case on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, but Judge Caluag denied the motion and ordered KKM to answer [2]. KKM filed this petition for certiorari and prohibition to challenge the CFI's jurisdiction [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to issue a writ of injunction or prohibition against the Court of Industrial Relations.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) is equal in rank with the Courts of First Instance [3]. Under settled jurisprudence, writs of injunction or prohibition may be issued only by a court to another tribunal or officer exercising judicial or ministerial functions that is **lower in rank** [3, 4]. Since the CFI and CIR are co-equal courts, the CFI presided by Judge Caluag has no jurisdiction to issue such writs against the CIR or its officers [3].

The petition was **GRANTED** [5].
