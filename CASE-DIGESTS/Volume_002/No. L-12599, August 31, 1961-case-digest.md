I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE IRON MINES, INC. v. PEDRO A. VENIDA and DIRECTOR OF MINES, G.R. No. L-12599, August 31, 1961, 2 SCRA 1076, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Pedro A. Venida applied for a lease of a mining claim known as "Paracale 19". Petitioner Philippine Iron Mines, Inc. filed an adverse claim with the Bureau of Mines, alleging that "Paracale 19" overlapped with its own mining claims, "Villa 1" and "Villa 2". Pursuant to Section 73 of the Mining Act, Petitioner filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Camarines Norte against Venida and the Director of Mines to determine the controversy.

Venida moved to dismiss, arguing the adverse claim was insufficient under the Mining Act for failing to detail metes and bounds or submit survey plans, thus preventing the court from acquiring jurisdiction. The Director of Mines also moved to dismiss, claiming no cause of action existed against him. The trial court dismissed the complaint on both grounds: it held the adverse claim was insufficient to confer jurisdiction, and the Director was not a party to the controversy. Petitioner appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the adverse claim filed by the petitioner was sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the court under Section 73 of the Mining Act.
2. W/N the Director of Mines is a necessary party to the case.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the adverse claim was sufficient. Under Section 73 of the Mining Act, a claimant must file an adverse claim and subsequently present a complaint to a competent court within 30 days [1, 2]. The Petitioner's adverse claim sufficiently stated that Venida's application covered portions of their claims and included declarations of location showing overlapping cadastral lots (Lots Nos. 93, 116, 519) [3, 4]. The Court noted that the Director of Mines had already accepted the adverse claim as duly filed, implying it met the necessary requirements [5]. Thus, the trial court erred in finding the identification of claims insufficient.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the Director of Mines is not a necessary party. Section 73 of the Mining Act provides that once an adverse claim is filed, the controversy is referred to the court [6]. The Director acts merely as a disinterested and impartial party who must wait for the court's decision before acting on the lease application [7, 8].

**Disposition:** The order dismissing the complaint against the Director of Mines is **AFFIRMED**. The order dismissing the complaint against Pedro A. Venida is **SET ASIDE**, and the case is **REMANDED** for further proceedings.
