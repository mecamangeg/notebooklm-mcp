I. CAPTION
PEDRO TY BELIZAR v. FLORENCIO BRAZAS, FELIX HILARIO, LUCIO BALDONILO, FELIX BALATO, TEODORO BALATO, and TODESCO CEBUANO, G.R. No. L-15992, May 31, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Pedro Ty Belizar, operator of the Samar Express Transit, filed a complaint for damages against the defendants, who were employees of the Bureau of Public Highways. Belizar alleged that due to the defendants' gross negligence in failing to provide safety devices on a ferry boat they operated, one of his auto-trucks fell into the Taft River and was submerged for over 30 hours [1]. The defendants filed motions to dismiss, arguing that they were being sued in their official capacities and that the claim should be directed against the State [2]. The Court of First Instance of Samar dismissed the complaint on June 6, 1959 [3]. Belizar appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N government employees can be sued personally for their negligent acts committed during the performance of their duties.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that although Article 2180 of the Civil Code provides for the liability of an employer for the tortious acts of employees, this does not exempt the employees from personal liability, especially when there is proof of negligence on their part [3]. The injured party may bring an action directly against the author of the negligent act. The Court clarified that the indication of the defendants' official duties and positions in the complaint did not convert the suit into an action against the Government [4]. Furthermore, the Court noted that this action was based on quasi-delict (tort), making the authorities relied upon by the lower court regarding contracts of transportation inapplicable [3].

Accordingly, the Order of dismissal was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [4].
