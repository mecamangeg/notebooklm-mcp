**I. CAPTION**
LUNETA MOTOR COMPANY v. RUBEN A. VILLALUZ, G.R. No. L-14210, June 30, 1961, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Maximino Salvador, the original owner of a REO truck, renewed its registration for the year 1956 but paid only the first installment (50%) of the annual fee, availing of the mode of payment allowed under Act No. 3992. In May 1956, the truck was sold at a public auction to Luneta Motor Company (Luneta). The second installment, due in August 1956, was not paid on time [1].

Luneta eventually paid the balance on August 30, 1957. The Motor Vehicles Office, led by Chief Ruben Villaluz, imposed a penalty of P240.00, representing 50% of the *entire* annual registration fee. Luneta paid under protest and filed a suit for reimbursement, arguing the penalty should be calculated only on the unpaid balance [2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Luneta, holding that the penalty should be charged only against the amount of delinquency. Villaluz appealed [1, 3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the 50% penalty for delinquent registration fees should be based on the entire annual fee rather than just the unpaid installment.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court held that the penalty must be based on the registration fee for the whole year.

Under Act No. 3992 (Revised Motor Vehicles Law), registration is yearly, not quarterly or semestral. The provision allowing payment in two installments is merely a privilege for the convenience of the taxpayer and does not alter the fact that the vehicle is registered for the entire year [4].

Section 67(a) of the Act imposes a 50% penalty on fees "corresponding to the portion of the year for which the vehicle is registered for use" [4, 5]. Since the truck was registered for the full year of 1956, the penalty applies to the whole annual fee. The failure to pay the second installment rendered the registration delinquent, and the subsequent penalty calculation correctly covered the entire year's fee [4, 5].

The appealed decision was **REVERSED** and the action dismissed [6].
