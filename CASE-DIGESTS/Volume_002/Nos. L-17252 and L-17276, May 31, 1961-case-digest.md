I. CAPTION
GORGONIO MIRANDA, ET AL. v. CITY OF MANILA, G.R. Nos. L-17252 and L-17276, May 31, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellees Miranda et al. filed complaints before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to invalidate Ordinance No. 3628, which regulated pinball machines, and Ordinance No. 3941, which prohibited the granting of licenses for the operation of pinball machines entirely. They sought to enjoin the City of Manila from enforcing these ordinances against their businesses. The CFI rendered a decision declaring both ordinances null and void. The City appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the cases to the Supreme Court as they involved the constitutionality of Ordinance No. 3941.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N pinball machines are gambling devices.
2. W/N Ordinance No. 3941 prohibiting pinball machines is valid and constitutional.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that pinball machines, whether of the non-flipper (one-ball) or flipper (five-ball) type, are gambling devices because winning depends mostly, if not wholly, upon chance or hazard, and the element of skill involved is nil [1-3]. Citing *Uy Ha v. The City Mayor*, the Court reasoned that these machines encourage the gambling instinct, leading to idleness, economic waste, and criminality, particularly among school children [3, 4]. Since their operation depends on chance, they are prohibited and penalized under Article 195 of the Revised Penal Code [5].

2. **YES.** The Municipal Board of Manila acted correctly in enacting Ordinance No. 3941 to suppress pinball machines under the General Welfare Clause of the City Charter [2, 6]. While the City Charter empowers the board to regulate "slot machines," this power applies only to machines that are not *per se* gambling devices; devices that are gambling in nature and prohibited by law, such as pinball machines, cannot be the subject of regulation and are properly subject to suppression [7].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the cases are dismissed [8].
