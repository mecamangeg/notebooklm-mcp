I. CAPTION
DAVID FUENTES v. ISABELO V. BINAMIRA, G.R. No. L-14965, August 31, 1961, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
On August 23, 1954, the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded David Fuentes P308.23 as compensation for injuries sustained while employed by respondent Isabelo Binamira. This decision became final and executory. On April 4, 1957, Fuentes filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu to enforce the WCC decision. Binamira opposed, claiming he was denied due process before the WCC because he was never informed of the proceedings, although he admitted receiving a "letter-computation" to which he replied disclaiming liability.

On September 5, 1958, the CFI heard the petition. Binamira failed to appear. The CFI rendered judgment confirming the WCC award and ordering payment. Binamira moved for reconsideration, alleging he was not notified of the September 5 hearing. The CFI denied the motion, ruling that notice of the hearing was not required for the execution of a final WCC award. Binamira appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CFI judgment is void due to lack of notice of the hearing to the respondent.
2. W/N the respondent can challenge the validity of the WCC award during the judicial enforcement proceedings.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 51 of Act No. 3428 (Workmen’s Compensation Act), there is no requirement for notification to the other party before the court hears a petition for enforcement. The law provides that upon the filing of a certified copy of the referee's or Commissioner's decision, the court "shall render a decree or judgment in accordance therewith and notify the parties thereof" [1, 2]. Thus, the respondent is entitled to notice only of the judgment rendered, not the hearing itself [3, 4].

2. **NO.** The function of the court in proceedings to enforce a WCC award is merely ministerial—to render judgment in accordance with the award [5, 6]. It has no power to modify or alter the decision, as doing so would make the matter controversial and subject to appeal, which the law expressly prohibits [6]. If the respondent intended to question the denial of his right to a hearing or lack of notice regarding the WCC award, he should have done so in a proper proceeding, such as a petition for relief, not during execution [5, 7, 8]. Furthermore, since Binamira failed to controvert the claim initially despite implicit knowledge, he is deemed to have waived his right to interpose defenses [9-11].

The appeal is dismissed, and the judgment of the lower court is affirmed [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
