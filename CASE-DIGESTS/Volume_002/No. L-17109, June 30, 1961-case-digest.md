I. CAPTION
SAMAR MINING CO., INC. v. FRANCISCO P. ARNADO, POMPEYO V. TAN, and RUFINO ABUYEN, G.R. No. L-17109, June 30, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Rufino Abuyen filed a claim for compensation with the Workmen’s Compensation Commission for a disease contracted while employed by petitioner Samar Mining Co., Inc. Respondent Pompeyo V. Tan, a Labor Attorney, set the hearing in Catbalogan, Samar [1]. Petitioner objected, arguing that authority lay with Regional Office No. VI in Cebu City under Reorganization Plan 20-A, not with Tan. Tan proceeded, ruled in favor of Abuyen, and denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration [1, 2].

Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against respondents Arnado (Regional Administrator) and Tan to annul the proceedings [3]. The CFI of Manila dismissed the petition on the ground of wrong venue, as the respondents and the Regional Office were based in Cebu/Samar, not Manila [4, 5]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that Rule 67, Section 4 is a jurisdiction provision allowing filing in any CFI, and that under Rule 5, venue was proper at the plaintiff's residence (Manila) [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance of Manila is the proper venue for a petition for certiorari and prohibition against officers acting in Cebu and Samar.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. Rule 67, Section 4 of the Rules of Court, entitled "Where petition filed," contemplates venue but makes it coterminous with jurisdiction over the "corporation, board, officer or person" whose acts are in question [8].

The Court held that the rule-making power of the Supreme Court is limited to procedure, while the power to define and apportion jurisdiction belongs to Congress [8]. Under the Judiciary Act of 1948 (Section 44[h]), Courts of First Instance only have the power to issue writs of certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus within their respective provinces and districts [5, 8]. Consequently, the CFI of Manila lacks jurisdiction to issue writs against respondents Arnado and Tan, who are officers acting for Regional Office No. VI in Cebu and enforcing acts in Samar [8, 9]. Thus, venue was improperly laid in Manila.

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [10].
