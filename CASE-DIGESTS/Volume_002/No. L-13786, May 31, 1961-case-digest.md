**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF LEE PA TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. TAN LIN, ET AL. v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-13786, May 31, 1961, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
Lee Pa filed a petition for naturalization which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Manila on March 31, 1953 [1]. Under Republic Act No. 530, the decision would not become executory until after a two-year probationary period, ending March 31, 1955 [1]. Lee Pa did not request the execution of the judgment or take his oath of allegiance. He fell ill and died on September 26, 1956, leaving his widow, petitioner Tan Lin, and nine minor children [1, 2]. On March 6, 1958, Tan Lin filed a petition invoking Section 16 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 (Revised Naturalization Law) to continue the proceedings, praying that Lee Pa be declared a naturalized citizen and that she be allowed to take the oath of allegiance for herself and their children [2, 3]. The Solicitor General opposed, arguing that Section 16 applies only if the applicant dies *before* a final decision is rendered, and that Lee Pa had abandoned his application [4, 5]. The lower court denied Tan Lin’s petition [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the widow and minor children may continue the naturalization proceedings under Section 16 of C.A. No. 473 when the petitioner died after the decision was rendered but before it became executory.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that the widow and minor children may continue the proceedings. Although Section 16 of C.A. No. 473 states that the right to continue proceedings applies if the petitioner dies "before the final decision has been rendered" [7], the Court held that a judgment in naturalization cases does not become final in the strict sense until after the certificate of naturalization is issued and the requirements of R.A. No. 530 are complied with [8, 9]. The Court noted that when Section 16 was enacted, the additional two-year probationary period under R.A. No. 530 did not yet exist, so the law did not contemplate a death occurring during this interim [9]. The intent of the law is to treat the proceedings as if the petitioner were alive for the benefit of the widow and children [10]. Additionally, the Court found the widow's delay in filing to be excusable negligence due to her husband's illness and her subsequent responsibilities managing the family business and children [11].

The order appealed from is set aside, and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [12].
