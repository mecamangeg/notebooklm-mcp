**I. CAPTION**
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. TAN TIAM alias J. CHUA KE SENG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-14802, May 30, 1961, De Leon, J.

**II. FACTS**
On October 22, 1956, the Court of First Instance of Manila issued an order declaring petitioner Tan Tiam a naturalized citizen, subject to the two-year probationary period required by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 530. On October 7, 1958, petitioner filed a petition to take his oath of allegiance, claiming compliance with all requirements. However, during the hearing, it was revealed that on February 5, 1957—within the two-year probationary period and while still a Chinese citizen—petitioner entered into a "Contract to Sell" with Sta. Mesa Realty, Inc. for a parcel of land in Sampaloc, Manila. He admitted to consenting to be described as "Filipino" in the contract, allegedly upon the advice of an agent that he would be naturalized before the ten-year payment period lapsed. The lower court denied his petition to take the oath for failure to comply with Section 1 of R.A. No. 530. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner's execution of a contract to sell real property and misrepresentation of his nationality as "Filipino" during the two-year probationary period disqualify him from taking the oath of allegiance.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's denial. The Constitutional prohibition against aliens acquiring private agricultural lands is a "government-announced policy." Under Section 1 of R.A. No. 530, an applicant must not engage in acts "prejudicial to the interest of the nation or contrary to any Government announced policies" during the two-year probationary period. By executing the contract and misrepresenting himself as a Filipino, the petitioner acted contrary to this policy and arrogated unto himself a prized attribute of citizenship he did not yet possess, casting doubt on his sincerity.

Although ownership might only transfer after ten years of payments, the contract gave him immediate rights to enforce the sale and take possession. The Court emphasized that an applicant has no right to presume admission to citizenship at the end of the probationary period. Strict compliance with R.A. No. 530 is essential to prevent abuse, confusion, and falsehood (*Dee Sam v. Republic*).

**ORDER AFFIRMED.**
