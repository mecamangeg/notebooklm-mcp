I. CAPTION
PAULO ANG and SALLY C. ANG v. FULTON FIRE INSURANCE CO., G.R. No. L-15862, July 31, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant Fulton Fire Insurance Company issued a fire insurance policy covering the plaintiffs' department store in Ilocos Norte [1, 2]. The policy contained a condition (Paragraph 13) stipulating that if a claim is rejected, an action must be commenced within 12 months after such rejection, or all benefits under the policy would be forfeited [3, 4]. The store was destroyed by fire on December 27, 1954 [2]. Fulton denied the plaintiffs' claim, and plaintiffs received the notice of denial on April 19, 1956 [5]. On May 11, 1956, plaintiffs filed a civil case against Paramount Surety (Fulton's agent) but not against Fulton itself; this case was dismissed without prejudice on September 3, 1957 [3, 6]. On May 5, 1958, plaintiffs filed the present action against Fulton [3]. Fulton argued the action was barred by the 12-month contractual prescriptive period [3]. The trial court ruled in favor of plaintiffs, holding that the filing of the previous suit against the agent tolled the running of the prescriptive period under the Civil Code rules on prescription [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the filing of a previous action against the insurer's agent tolls the running of the 12-month contractual period for filing an action against the insurer.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the condition in the policy requiring claims to be presented within one year after rejection is not merely procedural but a condition precedent to the liability of the insurer [8, 9]. It operates as a resolutory clause intended to terminate all liabilities if the suit is not brought within the stipulated period [9, 10]. The Court ruled that filing an action against the agent has no legal effect on the principal (Fulton) other than notification, and there is no law extending the effect of such action to the principal [11-13].

Furthermore, the Court emphasized that contractual limitations in insurance policies prevail over statutory limitations and exceptions, such as Article 1155 of the Civil Code regarding the interruption of prescription [14-16]. Citing *E. Macias & Co. vs. China Fire Insurance & Co.*, the Court declared that the contract is the law between the parties and its terms regarding the limitation of actions must govern over general statutory rules [16, 17]. Since the action against Fulton was filed more than 12 months after the rejection of the claim, the benefits were forfeited.

The judgment appealed from is set aside and the case dismissed [18].
