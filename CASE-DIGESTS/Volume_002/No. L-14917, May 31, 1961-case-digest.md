I. CAPTION
AURELIO P. REYES and FRANCISCO REYES v. THE HON. GUILLERMO ROMERO and THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-14917, May 31, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Judge Romero, the Justice of the Peace of Parañaque, was designated as Acting Municipal Judge of Pasay City via Administrative Order No. 134 while the regular judge, Judge Tianco, was on leave [1]. Romero began trying Criminal Case No. 8370 against petitioners [2, 3]. Upon Judge Tianco's return to office on December 11, 1958, Romero continued to hear the case [4]. Petitioners moved for Romero's inhibition, arguing that Tianco's return terminated Romero's designation, but the motion was denied [4].

Subsequently, the Secretary of Justice issued Administrative Order No. 183, designating Romero to try the specific case whenever Judge Tianco went on leave for those hearings [2]. This arrangement was requested by Judge Tianco himself to allow Romero to finish the case he had started [3]. Petitioners filed a petition for Prohibition, claiming the order violated the Pasay City Charter and judicial independence [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Administrative Order No. 183 designating Judge Romero to continue hearing the specific case is valid.
2. W/N Judge Romero acted with grave abuse of discretion in refusing to inhibit himself.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Administrative Order No. 183 is valid. The Supreme Court ruled that Section 70 of the Judiciary Act of 1948 and Section 76 of the Pasay City Charter authorize the designation of a temporary judge from a nearby locality (like Parañaque) when the exigencies of the service demand it or in case of the regular judge's absence [3, 5, 6]. Here, the "exigency" was the interest of justice in having the judge who started the trial complete it, and Judge Tianco officially went on leave during the hearings to satisfy the requirement of "absence" [3].

2. **NO.** Judge Romero did not commit grave abuse of discretion. The Court noted that the petitioners failed to allege any lack of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion in their petition [3]. Furthermore, the Court held that a judge cannot be deemed to have abused their discretion—much less gravely—by merely complying with a valid and legal Administrative Order issued by the Secretary of Justice [3, 7].

The petition is denied, and the writ of preliminary injunction is dissolved [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Concepcion and Barrera took no part [8].
