I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LIBERATO GAGUI, ET AL. (EUSEBIO V. NAVARRO, Respondent)**, G.R. No. L-15473, June 30, 1961, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
On November 8, 1957, Criminal Case No. 2193 was called for trial in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga [1]. Atty. Eusebio V. Navarro, counsel of record for accused Liberato Gagui, failed to appear [1]. He had filed an urgent motion for postponement, alleging he was engaged in a civil case in Camarines Sur [2]. The trial judge found the explanation unsatisfactory, noting that the trial date had been set in open court with Navarro’s consultation and that the case had been pending for a considerable time [2]. Consequently, the court issued an order summarily imposing a fine of P100.00 on Navarro for delaying the case, followed by subsequent orders threatening subsidiary imprisonment and arrest if the fine was not paid [3, 4]. Navarro appealed, questioning the validity of the summary contempt orders [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the failure of counsel to appear for trial constitutes direct contempt that may be punished summarily.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the failure of counsel to appear for trial is not a direct contempt summarily punishable under Section 1 of Rule 64 of the Rules of Court [5]. Direct contempt requires misbehavior committed "in the presence of or so near a court or judge as to interrupt the administration of justice" [5]. Instead, an unjustified absence constitutes **indirect contempt** under Section 3(b) of Rule 64, defined as "disobedience of or resistance to a lawful writ, process, order, judgment, or command" [5]. Punishment for indirect contempt requires a written charge and an opportunity to be heard [5, 6]. Citing *Rivera v. Arellano*, the Court emphasized that absence from trial is not a contempt occurring in the view of the court [7]. Since the lower court punished Navarro summarily without a written charge or hearing, it acted in excess of jurisdiction [6].

The orders complained of were **SET ASIDE** [8].
