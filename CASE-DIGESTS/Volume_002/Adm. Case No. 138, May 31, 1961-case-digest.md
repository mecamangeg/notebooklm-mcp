I. CAPTION
CONRADO S. ACUÑA v. ISIDRO DUNCA and TIMOTEO DAVID, Adm. Case No. 138, May 31, 1961, Natividad, J.

II. FACTS
Adoracion Acuña, daughter of the complainant, sought to marry Alfonso Eugenio despite knowing he was already married to Marta Cruz. To "redeem her honor" and show good intentions, Adoracion asked respondent Atty. Timoteo David to draft an affidavit stating she knew of Eugenio's existing marriage but still intended to marry him. David acceded and drafted the affidavit on May 31, 1947, which Adoracion signed before marrying Eugenio that same day. Four days later, on June 4, 1947, respondent Atty. Isidro Dunca notarized the affidavit upon the request of Adoracion and David [1, 2]. Complainant filed a disbarment case against the respondents. Although the complainant later moved to dismiss the charge due to a "misunderstanding," the Supreme Court denied the motion and ordered the investigation to proceed [3]. Respondents admitted to the acts but claimed they acted out of courage to help a friend and employee, not for profit [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondents are administratively liable for preparing and notarizing an immoral affidavit.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the preparation and ratification of an immoral affidavit are disgraceful acts that constitute gross misconduct in office and a violation of the attorney's oath [4]. The Court relied on **Rule 127, Section 25 of the Rules of Court** and the doctrine in ***Panganiban v. Borromeo*** to establish that such acts warrant discipline [4]. However, the Court noted that the respondents acted out of "pure generosity" rather than for monetary consideration, entitling them to lenient treatment [4].

Accordingly, respondents Attorneys Isidro Dunca and Timoteo David were **SEVERELY CENSURED** with an admonition that a repetition of similar acts would be dealt with more severely [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS (if any)
Barrera, J., took no part [5].
