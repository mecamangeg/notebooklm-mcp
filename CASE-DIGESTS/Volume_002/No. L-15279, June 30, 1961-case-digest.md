**I. CAPTION**
**PHILIPPINE WOOD PRODUCTS and ALFREDO UY v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, TEODORICO GORME, et al., G.R. No. L-15279, June 30, 1961, Padilla, J.**

**II. FACTS**
Respondents Teodorico Gorme and seven others filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against petitioners Philippine Wood Products and Alfredo Uy [1]. They sought the recovery of minimum wage differentials under Republic Act No. 602, overtime and holiday pay under Commonwealth Act No. 444, and separation pay under Republic Act No. 1052 [1]. Crucially, they also prayed for **reinstatement** to their respective positions with back wages from the date of their dismissal [1].

Petitioners moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the CIR lacked jurisdiction over mere money claims and that there was no allegation of a dispute likely to cause a strike or lockout [1]. The CIR initially dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction [1]. However, respondents filed a petition to reopen the case citing the Supreme Court's ruling in *Gomez v. North Camarines Lumber Co.*, which held that such claims are within CIR jurisdiction [2]. The CIR reopened the case and denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration based on *res judicata* [2]. Petitioners then filed this petition for certiorari with prohibition [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the CIR has jurisdiction over claims for minimum wage, overtime, and separation pay when accompanied by a prayer for reinstatement.
2. W/N the fact that the employees are fewer than thirty-one (31) divests the CIR of jurisdiction.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that where the employer-employee relationship is still existing or is **sought to be reestablished** because of its wrongful severance (as where the employee seeks reinstatement), the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over all claims arising out of, or in connection with, the employment [4, 5]. This includes claims related to the Minimum Wage Law and the Eight-Hour Labor Law [5]. It is only when the relationship has been extinguished and *no* reinstatement is sought that the claims become mere money claims falling within the jurisdiction of regular courts [6, 7].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the requisite that the employees be thirty-one (31) in number for the Court to acquire jurisdiction is **not required** of those claiming payment for overtime service and minimum wage and seeking reinstatement [6, 7].

Petition denied [3, 8].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Concepcion, J., took no part) [8].
