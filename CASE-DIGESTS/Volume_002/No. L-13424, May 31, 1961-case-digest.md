I. CAPTION
BASILIA F. VDA. DE ZALDARRIAGA, ETC. v. PEDRO ZALDARRIAGA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-13424, May 31, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On June 5, 1953, plaintiff-appellee Basilia F. Vda. de Zaldarriaga, as administratrix of her husband Jose Zaldarriaga’s estate, filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental against defendants-appellants Pedro Zaldarriaga and others for partition, accounting, and annulment of a prior partition of certain lots and sugar quotas [1]. After trial, the lower court rendered a judgment declaring the prior partition and sale void, ordering Pedro Zaldarriaga to pay the estate specific sums, and allotting specific shares of the land and sugar quota to the parties [2-5]. However, because the boundaries of the respective shares were not yet delineated, the court appointed the Clerk of Court and another individual as commissioners under Rule 71 of the Rules of Court to make an equitable partition and report back to the court [6]. The defendants filed a notice of appeal against this decision before the commissioners could perform their duties [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal instituted by the defendants is premature on the ground that the lower court's decision was interlocutory.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, holding it was taken prematurely. The Court reasoned that the decision appealed from was not final but merely interlocutory because it did not put an end to the litigation in the trial court [8, 9]. Citing *Fuentebella v. Carrascoso*, the Court explained that under Rule 71 of the Rules of Court, substantial proceedings remained to be done, specifically: the appointment of commissioners, hearings where parties present evidence for equitable partition, the submission of the commissioners' report, and a subsequent court hearing on that report [9]. It is only after the hearing on the commissioners' report that the court may render a final judgment disposing of the action pursuant to Section 7, Rule 71 [9]. By appealing immediately after the appointment of commissioners, the defendants prevented the completion of these necessary proceedings.

Accordingly, the appeal is **DISMISSED** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings in accordance with Rule 71 [10].
