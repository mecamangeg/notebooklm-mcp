I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE COTTON DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION v. THE HON. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and RODRIGO SISON, G.R. No. L-16871, May 19, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Rodrigo Sison was employed as a tool-keeper by petitioner in General Santos, Cotabato. On November 14, 1957, he suffered a hemorrhage at work and sought treatment. He later returned to his home in Lingayen, Pangasinan, where he continued treatment and filed a compensation claim with Regional Office No. 1 in Dagupan City. Petitioner moved to transfer the hearing to General Santos, arguing that the venue should be the place of employment and that a hearing in Dagupan would be inconvenient and expensive for the company. The hearing officer denied the motion and the subsequent motion to dismiss, eventually rendering a decision in favor of Sison. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed the decision. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the residence of the claimant for venue purposes should be his place of abode during employment.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the claim for compensation was properly filed and heard in the regional office of the claimant's residence instead of the place of employment.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the WCC decision. Under **Section 1, Rule 16 of the Rules of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission**, a claim may be filed and heard in the regional office where the accident occurred, where the claimant resides, or where the respondent resides, **at the option of the claimant** [1]. The Court held that these provisions clearly grant the claimant the choice of venue to foster their convenience as the aggrieved party [1]. While this may cause inconvenience or pecuniary disadvantage to the employer, the rules prioritize the welfare of the laborer [2]. The Court also noted that petitioner's request for interrogatories to mitigate this inconvenience was filed too late, after the decision on the merits had explicitly been rendered [3].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [4].
