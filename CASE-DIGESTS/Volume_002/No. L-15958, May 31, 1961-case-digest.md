I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LEON RAMOS, FRANCISCA DE RAMOS, AVELINA RAMOS and one "INTSIK RAMOS", G.R. No. L-15958, May 31, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Aurora Padilla filed a case for grave slander by deed against the accused Leon Ramos, et al. in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Nueva Ecija [1]. The complaint alleged that the accused, conspiring together, uttered defamatory words against her ("HETO ANG IYO, PUTA KA, MALANDI KA") and subsequently attacked, boxed, and slapped her [2].

Prior to this, the accused had already been charged with slight physical injuries in the Justice of the Peace Court of Peñaranda, Nueva Ecija, regarding the same incident [3]. The CFI dismissed the complaint for grave slander by deed on the ground of double jeopardy, reasoning that the slander and the physical injuries arose from the same criminal impulse and constituted a single act [3, 4]. The Solicitor General appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the prosecution for grave slander by deed constitutes double jeopardy following a charge of slight physical injuries arising from the same incident.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal, ruling that double jeopardy was not present [5].

The Court explained that the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy bars punishment for the same *offense*, not necessarily for acts proceeding from the same criminal impulse [4]. In this case, the act of insulting (slander) is entirely distinct from the act of inflicting physical injuries [4]. Slander is an offense against honor, whereas slight physical injuries is an offense against persons [5, 6]. One offense is not included in the other, and they constitute different acts even if they occurred on the same occasion [5]. The Court distinguished the case from *People vs. Carmen*, noting that here, different acts constituting distinct offenses arose, rather than a single act producing multiple offenses [4].

Consequently, the Order appealed from was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [7].
