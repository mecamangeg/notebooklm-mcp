I. CAPTION
JULIAN BOÑAGA v. ROBERTO SOLER, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15717, June 30, 1961, 2 SCRA 755, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In the intestate proceedings for the estate of spouses Alejandro Ros and Maria Isaac, the probate court authorized the administrator, Juan Garza, to sell certain estate properties. On August 30, 1944, Garza sold over 1,000 hectares of land to Roberto Soler, which the court approved. The records were destroyed during the war and subsequently reconstituted. In 1951, Julian Boñaga was appointed as the new administrator. On May 9, 1952, Boñaga filed an action to annul the 1944 sale, alleging it was fraudulent and made without the required notice to the heirs. Soler filed a third motion to dismiss in 1955, raising prescription and estoppel for the first time. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, ruling that the action had prescribed and that Boñaga, as the successor administrator, was estopped from questioning the acts of his predecessor. Boñaga appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action to annul the sale has prescribed.
2. W/N the successor administrator is estopped from questioning the validity of the sale made by his predecessor.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the sale was null and void *ab initio* because it failed to comply with Sections 4 and 7 of Rule 90 of the Rules of Court, specifically the mandatory requisites of notice to the heirs and a hearing on the application to sell [1]. Under Article 1410 of the New Civil Code, actions to declare the inexistence of contracts do not prescribe [2]. Furthermore, Soler failed to raise prescription in his first two motions to dismiss and his answer; thus, the defense was deemed waived [3].

2. **NO.** A decedent’s representative is not estopped from questioning the validity of his own void deed purporting to convey land. *A fortiori*, a successor administrator cannot be estopped from questioning the acts of his predecessor that are not conformable to law [4].

The Order of the lower court dismissing the complaint is **REVERSED**, and the case is remanded for further proceedings [5].
