I. CAPTION
SOUTHERN MOTORS, INC. v. ANGELO MOSCOSO, G.R. No. L-14475, May 30, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant Angelo Moscoso bought a Chevrolet truck from plaintiff Southern Motors, Inc. on installments. He executed a promissory note for the balance of P4,915.00, secured by a chattel mortgage on the truck [1]. After paying P550.00, Moscoso failed to pay three installments, leaving an unpaid balance of P4,475.00 [1].

Southern Motors filed a complaint to recover the unpaid balance on the promissory note. Upon plaintiff's petition, the trial court issued a writ of attachment [2]. The Sheriff attached the mortgaged truck and Moscoso's house and lot [2]. Before trial, the truck was sold at a public auction to the plaintiff for P1,000.00 [3]. The trial court later ruled in favor of Southern Motors, ordering Moscoso to pay the remaining deficiency of P4,475.00 plus interest and fees [3]. Moscoso appealed, arguing that the attachment and sale of the truck amounted to a foreclosure of the chattel mortgage, which should bar the recovery of any deficiency under Article 1484 of the Civil Code [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the attachment and sale of the mortgaged property in an action for specific performance bars the recovery of a deficiency judgment under Article 1484.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that Southern Motors clearly chose the first remedy under Article 1484: to "exact fulfillment of the obligation" (specific performance), rather than the third remedy of foreclosure [6]. The complaint was an ordinary civil action for the recovery of the balance on the promissory note, governed by the Rules of Court, not a foreclosure proceeding under the Chattel Mortgage Law (Act No. 1508) [6].

The Court reasoned that the attachment was merely an incident to the civil action under Rule 59 [7]. Had the plaintiff intended to foreclose, it would not have filed an action in court or attached the defendant's house and lot [6]. Citing *Southern Motors, Inc. v. Magbanua*, the Court emphasized that a mortgage creditor who elects specific performance may enforce execution of the judgment on any of the debtor's properties, including the mortgaged property itself [8, 9]. Since the plaintiff did not foreclose the mortgage, the prohibition against deficiency judgments under Article 1484(3) does not apply.

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**J.B.L. Reyes, J.** (Concurring): Noted that a substantial difference exists between foreclosure and attachment: in attachment, the debtor may retain possession of the property by filing a counterbond, a remedy not available in foreclosure proceedings [10].
