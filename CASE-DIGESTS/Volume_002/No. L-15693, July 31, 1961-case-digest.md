I. CAPTION
LUCIA PITOGO v. SEN BEE TRADING COMPANY, MACARIO TAN and SERGIO TAN, G.R. No. L-15693, July 31, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Lucia Pitogo worked as a seamstress for defendant Sen Bee Trading Company from June 5, 1952, to January 11, 1958. She filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu to recover wage differentials, overtime pay, vacation and sick leave pay, and damages totaling P50,000.00 [1, 2].

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the CFI lacked jurisdiction. The lower court sustained the motion and dismissed the complaint, ruling that under Section 25, Article VI of Reorganization Plan 20-A, jurisdiction over money claims arising from labor standards violations belonged to the Regional Office of the Department of Labor, not the courts [2]. Pitogo appealed to the Supreme Court, challenging the constitutionality of Reorganization Plan 20-A insofar as it divested ordinary courts of jurisdiction conferred by law [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Regional Offices of the Department of Labor have jurisdiction over money claims of laborers under Reorganization Plan 20-A.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the Regional Offices of the Department of Labor are without jurisdiction to hear and decide money claims of laborers against their employers [4].

The Court held that the provisions of Reorganization Plan 20-A, particularly Section 25, which granted regional offices original and exclusive jurisdiction over such claims, are null and void. Relying on the doctrine in *Corominas, Jr., et al. v. Labor Standards Commission*, the Court explained that in enacting Republic Act No. 997, the Legislature did not intend to authorize the transfer of powers and jurisdiction from the courts of justice to officials or offices created by the Reorganization Plan. The Legislature cannot delegate its power to legislate or create courts of justice to any other agency of the Government [3, 5].

Consequently, the order of dismissal by the lower court is **REVERSED** and **SET ASIDE**, and the case is remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings [6].
