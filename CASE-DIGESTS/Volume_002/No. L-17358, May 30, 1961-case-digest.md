I. CAPTION
MOHAMAD-ALI DIMAPORO v. HON. MANUEL ESTIPONA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17358, May 30, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Mohamad-Ali Dimaporo and respondent Salvador T. Lluch were candidates for provincial governor of Lanao del Norte in the November 10, 1959 elections. Dimaporo was proclaimed the winner with 27,537 votes against Lluch’s 27,259. On December 10, 1959, Lluch filed an election protest covering 92 precincts, alleging frauds and irregularities. Dimaporo filed a counter-protest [1, 2].

On June 15, 1960, after recanvassing 29 precincts, Lluch moved to withdraw the protest regarding 36 precincts, deeming it unnecessary as he had won in the recanvassed ones. Dimaporo objected, arguing that the period for filing pleadings had expired and recanvassing had commenced [3]. The trial court initially denied the motion but later granted it upon reconsideration. Subsequently, Lluch moved that the keys to the ballot boxes be turned over to the Clerk of Court to facilitate the work, and that only two out of three commissioners be authorized to canvass. Dimaporo opposed this, citing Section 70 of the Revised Election Code which designates specific officials (Provincial Commander, Treasurer, Fiscal) as custodians of the keys. The trial court granted Lluch's motions [4, 5]. Dimaporo filed a petition for certiorari, alleging abuse of discretion [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the withdrawal of the protest regarding 36 precincts after the period for pleadings expired and recanvassing had started.
2. W/N the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the transfer of ballot box keys to the Clerk of Court and authorizing only two commissioners to conduct the canvass.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The trial court did not abuse its discretion. Although the motion to withdraw was filed after the period for pleadings expired and recanvassing began, the move was not to amend the protest but merely to inform the court of the protestant's desistance, which is his exclusive prerogative [6]. While election protests are impressed with public interest, substantiation depends on the protestant; if he desists, the case may be dismissed for lack of proof. The petitioner cannot claim prejudice because the precincts involved were not part of his counter-protest [6].

2. **NO.** Section 70 of the Revised Election Code provides that keys shall be kept by the Provincial Commander, Treasurer, and Fiscal "if before said date the Court did not order otherwise" [7]. This proviso confirms the Legislature's intent to grant the court discretion to order otherwise when circumstances, such as the officials' inability to attend due to other duties, might defeat the purpose of the protest or cause delay [7]. The Clerk of Court is a responsible official entitled to the confidence of the court [8]. Similarly, authorizing two out of three commissioners to canvass prevents unnecessary delay and falls within the court's sound discretion [9].

Petition denied [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Reyes, J.B.L., J., dissenting:**
Dissenting on the ground that public policy demands inquiry into allegations of fraud and terrorism. Treating the issue as the sole concern of the parties encourages irresponsibility; if frauds occurred, perpetrators must be punished, and if not, those making reckless charges should be liable for damages [10].
