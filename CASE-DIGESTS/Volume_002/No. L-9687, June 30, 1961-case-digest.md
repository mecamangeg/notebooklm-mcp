I. CAPTION
LIDDELL & CO., INC. v. THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-9687, June 30, 1961, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Liddell & Co., Inc. (Liddell & Co.) was engaged in importing and retailing cars and trucks. Frank Liddell owned and controlled the corporation, holding the vast majority of shares personally or through agreements with employees. On December 20, 1948, Liddell Motors, Inc. (Motors) was organized with a capital stock of P100,000, of which P20,000 was subscribed and paid by Irene Liddell, Frank’s wife. Beginning January 1949, Liddell & Co. stopped retailing vehicles and instead sold them to Motors at a lower price. Motors then sold the vehicles to the general public with a steep mark-up. Liddell & Co. paid sales tax based on its sales to Motors, not on the sales to the public.

The Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) determined that Motors was merely an *alter ego* of Liddell & Co. used to reduce tax liability under the progressive sales tax rates. The CIR assessed a sales tax deficiency of P1,317,629.61, basing the tax on the price sold to the public. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) upheld the CIR. Petitioner appealed, arguing, among others, that CTA Judge Umali was disqualified for having been a BIR official and that the decision was void for being signed past the 30-day period in R.A. No. 1125.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CTA decision is void due to Judge Umali's disqualification or failure to decide within the 30-day period.
2. W/N Liddell Motors, Inc. is the *alter ego* of Liddell & Co., Inc., justifying the disregard of their separate corporate personalities.
3. W/N the deficiency sales tax and surcharges were correctly computed.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The mere participation of a judge in a prior proceeding as an administrative official does not disqualify him from acting as a judge. Furthermore, the requirement in Section 13 of R.A. No. 1125 that cases be decided within 30 days is merely directory; decisions signed after this period are valid [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that Liddell Motors, Inc. was the *alter ego* of Liddell & Co. Evidence showed that Frank Liddell owned Liddell & Co. and also effectively owned Motors, as his wife Irene had no independent funds to pay her subscription [3-5]. Motors pursued no independent activities other than selling vehicles secured from Liddell & Co., often on the same day [6]. The arrangement was a scheme to evade the higher progressive sales tax rates [7, 8]. Where a corporation is a dummy, serves no business purpose, and is intended as a blind to shield tax evasion, the corporate form may be ignored [9, 10].

3. **NO.** The computation was modified. Following the *Yutivo* case, the deficiency sales tax should be based on the selling price to the public *after deducting* the tax already paid by Liddell & Co. on its original sales to Motors [11]. Additionally, the 50% fraud surcharge was removed because the transactions were embodied in proper documents subject to inspection, negating deliberate fraud. However, the 25% penalty for late payment was imposed [12].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is MODIFIED. Liddell & Co. is liable for P426,811.67 plus a 25% surcharge and interest [13].
