I. CAPTION
CONCEPCION NAVAL, ET AL. v. DOLORES JONSAY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-13664, May 30, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
In the execution of a judgment regarding property partition, the trial court appointed a Commissioner to designate a portion for the usufruct of defendant-appellant Dolores Jonsay, the surviving spouse [1]. The Commissioner submitted a report offering three "positions" or options [1]. Jonsay manifested her preference for the "third position," arguing it was the most productive and contained coconut trees she had planted [2-4]. The plaintiffs-appellees countered that the "first position" should be awarded, claiming it was advantageous and used for planting palay [4].

On March 14, 1957, without conducting a formal hearing or receiving evidence, the trial court issued an Order awarding the "first position" to Jonsay [5, 6]. Jonsay filed a motion for reconsideration, offering to present evidence that the awarded portion was unproductive, but the trial court denied the motion [5]. Jonsay appealed, arguing the court erred in disregarding her choice and denying her the opportunity to prove the awarded land was not beneficial [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in awarding the usufruct portion based solely on conflicting manifestations without receiving evidence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court could not properly determine which portion should be awarded to the widow solely based on pleadings and conflicting manifestations [6]. The truth of the parties' opposing claims regarding the productivity of the land could not be ascertained without the adduction of proofs [8, 9]. The parties should have been given the opportunity to present evidence to support their respective contentions, specifically regarding Jonsay's claim that the "first position" was unproductive and violated the purpose of usufruct intended by law [6]. Judicial decisions must be based on proven facts [9].

The Orders dated March 14, 1957, and March 28, 1957, are **REVERSED**, and the case is **REMANDED** to the trial court for further proceedings [9].
