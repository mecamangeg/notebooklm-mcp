I. CAPTION
EULALIO PARINGIT v. THE HON. HONORATO MASAKAYAN, SILVERIO CERTEZA, GAVINA DUA, EVE CERTEZA, FABIAN LABORIDA, and MARIANO ERIGINO, G.R. No. L-16578, July 31, 1961, Natividad, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Eulalio Paringit filed a complaint for malicious mischief against Silverio Certeza and others in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Aritao, Nueva Vizcaya, alleging they filled up his irrigation canal and caused damages of P5,600.00 [1]. The accused challenged the JP Court's jurisdiction, but the court proceeded, convicted five of the accused, and ordered them to pay a fine and indemnity [2]. The accused appealed the conviction, and Paringit appealed the civil aspect to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Nueva Vizcaya [3]. The CFI (Respondent Judge Masakayan) dismissed the case on the ground that the JP Court lacked jurisdiction originally because the damages claimed exceeded its jurisdiction [3]. Instead of appealing this dismissal, Paringit filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court alleging abuse of discretion [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for certiorari is the proper remedy to question the CFI's order dismissing the case on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that certiorari is not the proper remedy because an appeal was available. The Order of December 17, 1959, dismissing the case was a final order that completely disposed of the action [4]. Under Rule 67, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, certiorari lies only when there is no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law [5]. Even if the CFI erred in its assessment of jurisdiction, such an error is one of judgment or jurisdiction which is correctible only by appeal [5], [6].

Although the High Court noted that the CFI was indeed in error—because under the Judiciary Act of 1948, JP courts have original jurisdiction over malicious mischief regardless of the civil liability claimed, which is not part of the punishment [7], [8], [6]—the petitioner's failure to utilize the proper remedy of appeal was fatal. The petition was dismissed [9].
