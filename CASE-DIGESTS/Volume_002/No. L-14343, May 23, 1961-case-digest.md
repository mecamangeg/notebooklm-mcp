I. CAPTION
IN RE: PETITION FOR PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP, JEW CHONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-14343, May 23, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jew Chong, a Chinese citizen residing in the Philippines since 1921, filed a petition for naturalization [1]. He is married to a Filipino woman and has six children [1]. Regarding his livelihood, he is a partner and assistant manager at Dainty Restaurant in Iloilo City [1]. His financial evidence showed a monthly salary of P120.00 with free board and lodging, plus an annual profit share of roughly P112.50 (approximately P9.375 per month) from his P2,000 investment [1, 2]. This amounted to a total monthly income of about P129.375 [2]. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo granted his petition [1, 3]. The Republic appealed, initially questioning the children's use of the surname "Chia" instead of "Jew," but the Supreme Court focused on the petitioner's qualifications regarding his income [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner satisfies the requirement of having a known lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation. [2]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner failed to comply with the fourth paragraph of Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, which mandates that an applicant must have a "known lucrative trade, profession or lawful occupation" [2].

The Court calculated his total monthly income at approximately P129.375, which it deemed clearly not lucrative [2]. Citing *Lo Chicombing v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-14865), the Court noted that it had previously denied citizenship to a purchasing agent earning P120.00 a month who was single and had no dependents [2]. The Court reasoned that the petitioner's situation was far more precarious than that of *Lo Chicombing* because Jew Chong had to support a wife and six children [2]. Consequently, the decision of the lower court was set aside and the petition was dismissed [4].
