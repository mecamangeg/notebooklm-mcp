I. CAPTION
EQUITABLE BANKING CORPORATION and GO KIM PAH v. REGIONAL OFFICE 3 OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR and ALEJO GARCIA, G.R. No. L-14442, June 30, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On July 15, 1957, respondent Alejo Garcia filed a complaint with Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor against petitioners Equitable Banking Corporation and Go Kim Pah [1]. Garcia sought to collect P2,000.00 representing unpaid overtime, vacation, and separation pay earned as a janitor-messenger from 1951 to 1957 [1].

Petitioners filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the grant of adjudicatory power to regional offices under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A was null and void as it constituted an undue delegation of legislative power [1]. The Regional Office denied the motion [1]. Petitioners then filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [1]. The CFI rendered judgment in favor of petitioners, declaring Reorganization Plan No. 20-A unconstitutional insofar as it divested courts of jurisdiction over money claims and transferred them to executive offices, which was not authorized by the enabling statute, Republic Act No. 997 [2]. Respondents appealed the decision [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Regional Office of the Department of Labor has jurisdiction over money claims such as overtime and separation pay under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that Regional Office No. 3 had no jurisdiction to hear and decide Garcia's claim [4, 5]. The Court held that the grant of original and exclusive jurisdiction to regional offices over cases involving money claims—including overtime pay, unpaid wages, and wages for Sundays and legal holidays—is not authorized by the provisions of Republic Act No. 997 [4, 6]. The legislature did not intend to grant authority to the Government Survey and Reorganization Commission to deprive the courts of jurisdiction over said claims and transfer them to regional offices [4, 6]. The Court relied on the precedent set in recently decided cases, including *Corominas v. Labor Standards Commission* and *Manila Central University v. Calupitan* [4].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [5].
