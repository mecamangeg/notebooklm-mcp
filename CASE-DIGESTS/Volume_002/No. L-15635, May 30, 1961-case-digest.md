I. CAPTION
ISAAC PERAL BOWLING ALLEYS, petitioner, vs. UNITED EMPLOYEES WELFARE ASSOCIATION and the COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, respondents., G.R. No. L-15635, May 30, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In a previous decision (G.R. No. L-10327, Sept. 30, 1958), the Supreme Court affirmed a Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) order directing the petitioner, Isaac Peral Bowling Alleys, to reinstate four pinboys with back wages from November 11, 1952, to December 22, 1954. The Court clarified that wages earned by the pinboys elsewhere during their suspension should be deducted from the back wages.

The petitioner reinstated the pinboys, and the CIR received evidence to determine the deductible earnings. On May 25, 1959, the CIR issued an order calculating the specific amounts to be deducted for pinboys Petronio Beriña and Claro Bordones and ordered the petitioner to deposit the net back wages. The petitioner moved for reconsideration, which the CIR en banc denied. The petitioner then filed an appeal by certiorari, arguing that the CIR lost jurisdiction to hear the incidents of the case under Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act) and disputing the factual computation of the earnings.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR retained jurisdiction to hear and decide the incidents of the case regarding back wages.
2. W/N the Supreme Court can review the factual findings regarding the amounts deductible from the back wages.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The CIR retained jurisdiction. The original case (Case No. 751-V) commenced on October 10, 1952, which was prior to the approval of the Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act No. 875) on June 17, 1953. Pursuant to Section 27 of R.A. No. 875, the CIR retains its authority to hear and decide all incidents of cases pending at the time of the Act's approval, in accordance with the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 103, until all issues are fully settled and disposed of.

2. **NO.** Questions of fact cannot be raised in an appeal by certiorari under Commonwealth Act No. 103, Section 14. The petitioner's claim that the CIR should have deducted additional sums based on alleged earnings is a factual issue. The Court reiterated the doctrine that factual findings of the CIR are generally binding and not reviewable in this mode of appeal, citing *Indias v. Philippine Iron Mines* and *Olaivar v. Meralco*.

The order and resolution appealed from are AFFIRMED.
