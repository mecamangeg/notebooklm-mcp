**I. CAPTION**
NATIONAL LABOR UNION, petitioner, vs. ZIP VENETIAN BLIND and/or EUSEBIO NAZARIO, General Manager, respondents., G.R. Nos. L-15827 and L-15828, May 31, 1961, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Zip Venetian Blind and the Zip Workers Union executed a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) on July 2, 1956, containing a closed-shop provision. Pursuant to the union's demand, respondent management issued a memorandum requiring all employees to join Zip Workers Union within 48 hours or face dismissal. Nineteen factory workers, who were members of petitioner National Labor Union (NLU), refused to join and were subsequently dismissed in July and August 1956. NLU filed unfair labor practice charges. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ordered the reinstatement of the 19 laborers but denied their claim for back wages, ruling that the employer acted in good faith by relying on the CBA's stipulations. Petitioner NLU appealed, questioning the denial of back wages [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the dismissed employees are entitled to back wages despite the employer's claim of good faith in enforcing the closed-shop provision.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's order. The Court held that the CIR is vested by law with the discretion to award or not to award back pay under Section 5(c) of Republic Act No. 875 [8]. The CIR's pronouncement regarding the employer's good faith is a finding of fact which depends on the credibility of evidence and is generally not reviewable on appeal by certiorari [7].

The Court noted that the CBA stipulation ("The EMPLOYER further agrees not to maintain in its employ any laborer or employee who is not a member of the UNION") explicitly applied to persons already in the service. Thus, the respondent honestly believed it was bound to dismiss non-members and could not have anticipated that the courts would later invalidate the provision as applied to old employees [9]. Citing *Confederated Sons of Labor vs. Anakan Lumber Co.*, the Court reiterated that where an employer acts in good faith under analogous conditions, reinstatement without back pay is proper [9], [8].

**Petition denied; Order and resolution affirmed.**
