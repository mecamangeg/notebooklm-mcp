I. CAPTION
BENITO SY HUAN v. HONS. JOSE P. BAUTISTA, ET AL. and LUMBER SAWDUST WORKERS’ UNION (PLUM), G.R. No. L-16115, August 29, 1961, Natividad, J.

II. FACTS
On September 22, 1954, respondent Lumber Sawdust Workers’ Union (PLUM) filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against petitioner Benito Sy Huan, seeking compensation for overtime, Sunday, and holiday services for 23 of its members [1]. Sy Huan filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction as there was no industrial dispute [2]. The CIR initially dismissed the petition on August 22, 1955 [3]. However, on May 13, 1959, the CIR issued a resolution setting aside the dismissal, declaring it had jurisdiction, and setting the case for hearing [3]. Sy Huan filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition, contending that since the employer-employee relationship had ceased and no reinstatement was sought, the CIR had no jurisdiction over the mere money claims [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over money claims for overtime and holiday pay when the employer-employee relationship has terminated and no reinstatement is sought.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations extends to cases involving the Minimum Wage Law, Eight-Hour Labor Law, or unfair labor practices only when the controversy arises while the employer-employee relationship exists, or when the former employee seeks reinstatement [4, 5].

The Court cited *Price Stabilization Corporation vs. Court of Industrial Relations*, holding that "after the termination of the relationship and no reinstatement is sought, such claims become mere money claims, and come within the jurisdiction of the regular courts" [5, 6]. In this case, the Union’s petition did not allege that the 23 members were still employed or seeking reinstatement, and the pleadings indicated the relationship had been severed [7, 8]. Thus, the demand was a purely money claim falling under the jurisdiction of the regular courts [9].

The petition is GRANTED; the CIR resolution of May 13, 1959 is VACATED and SET ASIDE, and the writ of injunction is made permanent [9].
