I. CAPTION
PACIENCIA B. SALITA v. EDUARDO CALLEJA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17314, June 30, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Eduardo Calleja obtained a money judgment against Francisco Domingo. On January 7, 1954, Calleja levied a preliminary attachment on a house belonging to Domingo. The house stood on a lot that Domingo's wife had purchased on installment from Realty Investments, Inc., and the land title was still in the vendor's name. Calleja registered the attachment under Act No. 3344, noting that the house was not registered under the Torrens system (Act 496) or the Spanish Mortgage Law. This attachment was not annotated on the land title.

On February 3, 1955, Domingo's wife sold the house and lot to Paciencia Salita, who assumed the outstanding mortgage to Realty Investments, Inc. Salita obtained a new Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT), which contained no annotation of Calleja's attachment. Salita later paid off the mortgage. When Calleja sought to sell the house to satisfy his judgment against Domingo, Salita filed a third-party claim and subsequently an action for injunction and damages to stop the execution sale. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed Salita's complaint, upholding the validity of Calleja's attachment. Salita appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the registration of an attachment on a house under Act No. 3344 is valid and binding against a subsequent purchaser for value when the land on which it stands is registered under the Torrens System (Act No. 496).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the registration of the attachment under Act No. 3344 was invalid and had no binding effect on Salita.

Act No. 3344 allows for the registration of instruments referring only to "unregistered land and its own improvements only." It does not apply to improvements on lands already registered under the Torrens system. To rule otherwise would create an anomalous situation of dual registration. Since the house was built on titled land, Calleja should have perfected his lien by filing a petition under Section 112 of Act No. 496 to have the attachment annotated on the certificate of title.

Salita, a purchaser in good faith, acquired the land with a clean title. Under the Civil Code and jurisprudence, unless otherwise stated on the title, the land includes all improvements existing thereon (Art. 2127, Civil Code; Art. 440, Civil Code). Having failed to properly annotate his lien on the Torrens title, Calleja cannot enforce it against Salita.

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the injunction is granted.
