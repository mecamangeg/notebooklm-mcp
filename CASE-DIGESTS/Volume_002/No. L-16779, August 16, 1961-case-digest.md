I. CAPTION
NATIONAL ABACA AND OTHER FIBERS CORPORATION v. APOLONIA PORE, G.R. No. L-16779, August 16, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On November 14, 1953, petitioner National Abaca and Other Fibers Corporation (NAFCO) filed a complaint against respondent Apolonia Pore in the Municipal Court of Tacloban for the recovery of money advanced for hemp purchases. The Municipal Court ruled in favor of NAFCO. Pore appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte.

In the CFI, Pore moved to dismiss, arguing NAFCO had no legal capacity to sue because it was abolished by Executive Order No. 372 on November 24, 1950. NAFCO opposed, arguing it retained corporate existence for three years (until November 1953) to prosecute suits, and this action was filed within that period. The CFI ordered NAFCO to amend its complaint to include the Board of Liquidators as a co-party plaintiff. NAFCO failed to file the original amended complaint on time due to the excusable negligence of its mailing clerk, though a copy was sent to Pore. Consequently, the CFI dismissed the case and denied NAFCO's Motion for Reconsideration. NAFCO appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a corporation may continue a pending action in its own name after the expiration of the three-year liquidation period.
2. W/N the lower court erred in denying the motion for reconsideration and dismissing the case due to the failure to file the amended complaint.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** In the absence of a statutory provision to the contrary, pending actions by or against a corporation are abated upon the expiration of the period allowed by law for liquidation. The Court held that the Corporation Law contains no provision authorizing a corporation to continue actions in its corporate name after the three-year period. Section 77 provides that a corporation continues "for three years... for the purpose of prosecuting and defending suits," implying that thereafter it no longer enjoys corporate existence for such purpose [1]. Section 78 authorizes the conveyance of property to trustees within those three years to enable said trustees to prosecute suits [1]. Without such conveyance or substitution, the corporation ceases to exist as an entity capable of suing [2].

2. **YES.** The Supreme Court found that the complete loss of NAFCO's corporate existence impelled the creation of the Board of Liquidators to manage pending matters [3]. The lower court erred in not admitting the amended complaint which sought to include said Board. The record showed that NAFCO had actually prepared the amended complaint and sent a copy to the respondent; the failure to file the original with the court was due to the excusable negligence of the mailing clerk [3]. Given the validity of the claim as evidenced by the favorable municipal court judgment, the amended complaint including the Board of Liquidators is admitted.

The orders appealed from are **REVERSED** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [4].
