I. CAPTION
In the Matter of the Petition for Consolidation of Ownership of Real Property, Maria V. Lindayag v. Dioscoro M. Dana, G.R. No. L-16734, July 31, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lindayag filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zambales (Civil Case No. 143) to consolidate ownership over a residential house based on a Deed of Sale with *pacto de retro*, claiming Respondent Dana failed to repurchase the property [1]. Dana moved to dismiss on the ground of *res judicata*, citing a previous final decision by the same court in Civil Case No. 1728 [1].

Civil Case No. 1728 was originally filed by Lindayag in the Justice of the Peace Court as an unlawful detainer case to eject Dana, claiming absolute ownership after the repurchase period expired [2]. Dana argued the contract was an equitable mortgage. The Justice of the Peace dismissed the case as premature [2]. On appeal, the CFI affirmed the dismissal but ruled on the merits, declaring the transaction an **equitable mortgage** under Article 1602 of the Civil Code due to the inadequate price and Dana’s continued possession [3, 4]. This decision became final [5].

In the present case (Civil Case No. 143), the CFI dismissed Lindayag’s petition for consolidation, sustaining the *res judicata* argument [1]. Lindayag appealed, arguing the first case was merely for unlawful detainer involving possession, not ownership [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for consolidation of ownership is barred by *res judicata* due to the prior judgment in the unlawful detainer case.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the order of dismissal, holding that the prior judgment constitutes a bar to the subsequent action [6, 7].

Although Civil Case No. 1728 was titled "unlawful detainer," the complaint specifically sought a ruling that Lindayag had become the absolute owner of the property [8]. While the Justice of the Peace Court lacked jurisdiction over ownership, when the case was appealed to the CFI and the parties did not raise the jurisdictional issue again, the CFI obtained original jurisdiction pursuant to Section 11, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court [9].

Consequently, the CFI in the first case validly tried and decided the nature of the contract, ruling it to be an equitable mortgage [9]. Since the question of ownership and the nature of the contract (Exhibit "A") were actually and necessarily included and adjudged in the former judgment, they cannot be raised again between the same parties under Section 45, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court [6, 10].

The order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED**.
