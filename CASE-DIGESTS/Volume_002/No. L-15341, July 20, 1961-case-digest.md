I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE TESTATE ESTATE OF JOSE COLLANTES; FELIX COLLANTES and ANITA RIUS DE COLLANTES v. JUAN M. COLLANTES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15341, July 20, 1961, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Felix and Anita Collantes filed for the probate of the will of the decedent, Jose L. Collantes, alleging the estate was worth approximately P38,780. Oppositors Juan M. Collantes et al. objected, alleging the estate was worth P176,000 [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila admitted the will to probate and issued letters testamentary to Felix [3].

The oppositors appealed. Although they initially filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals, they subsequently amended their record on appeal to request that the case be forwarded to the Supreme Court, claiming the estate's value exceeded P50,000 [2]. The errors assigned by the appellants in their brief focused on the competency and credibility of the witness Anita Rius de Collantes and the due execution of the will [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court found that the case falls within the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals [5].

Under Section 2 of Republic Act No. 2613, the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction when the amount involved does not exceed P200,000.00 [5]. In this case, the amount involved was found not to exceed this statutory limit [5]. Furthermore, the Supreme Court noted that the questions raised in the appellants' assignment of errors—specifically regarding the credibility of witnesses and the execution of the will—were purely factual in nature [5]. Matters involving purely factual questions and amounts within the statutory limit belong to the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court ordered the case certified to the Court of Appeals for determination [6].
