I. CAPTION
PEDRO REBADULIA, ET AL. v. HON. EMILIO BENITEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15971, July 31, 1961, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were bondsmen who used their properties as bail for the accused in Criminal Case No. 2909. After a judgment was rendered against the bonds, petitioners received a copy of the decision on April 11, 1959. On April 14, 1959, they filed a motion to set aside the judgment and a notice of appeal. The trial court initially denied the appeal, ruling that the judgment was already final and unappealable. However, upon petitioners' motion, the court reconsidered and gave due course to the appeal (docketed as G.R. No. L-15584). Despite the pending appeal, Respondent Sheriff issued a "Notice of Public Auction Sale" of petitioners' properties based on a writ of execution issued on March 31, 1959. Petitioners filed this action for prohibition to enjoin the sale.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the execution sale of petitioners' properties should proceed despite the pendency of the appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the sale should be held in abeyance. Under **Section 2, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court**, execution may issue in the discretion of the court before the expiration of the time to appeal only upon good reasons stated in a special order. However, after the appeal is perfected or the record on appeal is approved, the trial court generally loses jurisdiction to issue execution [1, 2]. Citing *Vda. de Sy Quia v. Concepcion* and *Unero v. Court of Appeals*, the Court noted that while the writ here was issued before the appeal was perfected, the lower court subsequently allowed the appeal. Therefore, without passing on the validity of the writ itself, the Court held that the interest of justice would be better served if the sale is suspended until the appeal in G.R. No. L-15584 is finally disposed of [3].

Petition granted. The preliminary injunction is made permanent subject to the decision in G.R. No. L-15584.
