I. CAPTION
FELICISIMO C. JOSON vs. EDUARDO JOSON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-9686, May 30, 1961, Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Tomas Joson died in 1945, and his son, Felicisimo Joson, was appointed administrator of his estate. Felicisimo filed accounts for the years 1945-1948. The heirs, including Eduardo Joson, opposed these accounts, alleging that the administrator diminished the heirs' shares, padded expenses, and failed to account for a difference of P132,600.00 in income [1], [2].

On December 30, 1952, the heirs entered into an extrajudicial settlement and partition of the estate to end their differences [3]. Subsequently, the administrator moved to close the proceedings and be relieved of his duties and accounts. The trial court granted the motion, ruling that the extrajudicial settlement implied that the heirs had approved the accounts and waived their opposition, rendering the accounting a "mere incident" that must yield to the settlement [4], [5]. The heirs appealed [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the execution of an extrajudicial settlement by the heirs implies a waiver of the administrator's duty to render an accounting of his administration.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the duty of an administrator to render an account is not a mere incident of an administration proceeding that can be waived or disregarded upon termination. It is a duty that must be performed and duly acted upon by the Court before the administration is finally closed [6].

The Court cited Rule 86 of the Rules of Court (1940), specifically:
1.  **Section 1:** Charges the administrator with the whole of the estate and its proceeds [7];
2.  **Section 8:** Imposes the duty to render an account within one year and such further accounts as required [7];
3.  **Sections 9 and 10:** Require notice to interested persons and examination of the administrator under oath regarding the accounts [8], [7].

The extrajudicial settlement did not expressly state that the accounts were waived or condoned. Given the alleged shortage of P132,600.00, the settlement could not be interpreted as a release of the administrator's obligation to prove his accounts [9].

**Order set aside and case remanded to trial court for further proceedings.**
