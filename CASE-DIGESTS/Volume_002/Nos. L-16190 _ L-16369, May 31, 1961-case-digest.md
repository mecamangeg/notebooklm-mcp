I. CAPTION
LUCIO L. MAYOR, ET AL. v. THE HON. RAYMUNDO VILLACETE, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-16190 & L-16369, May 31, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were registered voters in San Agustin, Romblon. Exclusion petitions were filed against them in the Justice of the Peace Court, alleging they were not Filipino citizens. The cases were elevated to the Court of First Instance (CFI). Petitioners moved to dismiss, arguing that citizenship cannot be inquired into in exclusion proceedings, but the CFI denied the motion. On November 7, 1959, the CFI ruled that petitioners were not Filipino citizens and disqualified them from the November 10, 1959 elections. Petitioners filed petitions for prohibition and certiorari with the Supreme Court to challenge the CFI's jurisdiction and the exclusion order.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitions challenging the exclusion order have become moot.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The petitions are dismissed as moot and *functus officio* because the elections of November 10, 1959, have already taken place [1]. The purpose of the petitions was to allow the petitioners to vote in that specific election. However, the Court emphasized that due to the summary character of an exclusion case, a decision rendered therein—even if final and unappealable—does not acquire the nature of *res judicata* [2]. Citing *Nuval v. Guray* (52 Phil. 645), the Court held that such a decision does not operate as a bar to any future action the petitioners may take to establish their Filipino citizenship and qualifications as voters [2].

Petitions dismissed.
