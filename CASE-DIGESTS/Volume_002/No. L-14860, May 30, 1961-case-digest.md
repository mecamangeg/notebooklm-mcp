I. CAPTION
ZACARIAS G. TAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-14860, May 30, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On May 31, 1956, Zacarias G. Tan, a Chinese citizen, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte [1]. He alleged he was employed with a monthly salary of P120.00 but did not submit a declaration of intention [1]. Upon the Republic’s motion to dismiss for failure to allege educational qualifications exempting him from said declaration, the CFI ordered an amendment [2]. Tan filed an amended petition alleging he completed his education in government-recognized schools, but this amended petition was never republished [2, 3]. The CFI granted the petition and directed the Clerk of Court to forward papers "as soon as possible," implying immediate execution [4]. The Solicitor General appealed, questioning the court's jurisdiction due to non-publication, the sufficiency of Tan's income, and the violation of the two-year waiting period [3, 5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court had jurisdiction to hear the amended petition without new publication.
2. W/N the petitioner satisfied the requirement of a lucrative trade or occupation.
3. W/N the decision violated Republic Act No. 530 regarding the execution of the judgment.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The amendment regarding educational completion is a material fact that entitles the petitioner to exemption from filing a declaration of intention [7]. This fact must be published to enable the public to furnish evidence to the government regarding such qualification [7]. Under Section 1 of R.A. No. 530, no petition should be heard until six months after the last publication; thus, the failure to publish the amended petition deprived the court of jurisdiction to hear and grant it (*Kiat Chun Tan v. Republic*) [7].

2. **NO.** A monthly income of P120.00 is not considered sufficiently lucrative due to the prevailing high cost of living (*Swee Din Tan v. Republic*) [8]. Furthermore, the employment certification issued by Tan's father was unsworn and incompetent, and the fact that Tan lived with his father raised suspicion that he was employed only for the purpose of the petition [5].

3. **YES.** The lower court's decision was objectionable because it directed the forwarding of papers "as soon as possible," giving the impression that the petitioner could take his oath without waiting for the mandatory two-year period provided by R.A. No. 530 [6].

The decision is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DISMISSED** [9].
