I. CAPTION
BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and OSCAR C. MELLA, G.R. No. L-16518, May 31, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Oscar C. Mella, a paying teller for the Philippine National Bank (PNB), was suspended on April 15, 1952, in connection with a criminal case involving fraudulent withdrawals by a third party. On May 27, 1953, the PNB Board of Directors approved his dismissal for cause based on a confidential NBI report [1]. Mella was never notified of specific charges nor afforded a formal hearing despite his requests, as PNB officials merely conducted interrogations to elicit facts [2], [3], [4]. PNB argued its Charter (Act 2612) grants the Board plenary power to remove employees with or without cause and without investigation [5]. Mella filed a petition for mandamus for reinstatement on April 12, 1955, which the lower court granted and the Court of Appeals affirmed (removing the damages award) [6], [7]. PNB appealed, contending the dismissal was valid and Mella’s action was barred by the one-year prescriptive period applicable to public officers [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the PNB Board may dismiss an employee without prior investigation or hearing despite its Charter powers.
2. W/N Mella’s action for reinstatement is barred by the one-year prescriptive period.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** While the PNB Charter grants the Board broad power to remove employees, the Board expressly promulgated Rules and Regulations requiring "proper investigation" before dismissal for specific offenses, including dishonesty and infidelity in handling funds [5], [9]. These Rules are binding and cannot be disregarded [10]. The Court held that mere interrogations do not constitute a due hearing where the employee can defend against specific charges [4]. The PNB’s claim that "lack of confidence" justifies dismissal without investigation was rejected because, for a teller, such loss of confidence necessarily relates to the handling of funds, which is a specified offense requiring investigation under the Rules [11].

2. **NO.** The rule fixing a one-year period to question the legality of a dismissal applies only to public officers and employees governed by the Civil Service Law [12]. The Court ruled that since positions in the PNB are not governed by the Civil Service Law, this prescriptive period does not apply to its employees [12]. Furthermore, Mella was not guilty of laches as he consistently requested a hearing and followed up on his case [13].

**Disposition:** The decision of the Court of Appeals is MODIFIED. Oscar C. Mella is ordered reinstated to the service of the Philippine National Bank, though not necessarily to the same position from which he was dismissed [14], [15].
