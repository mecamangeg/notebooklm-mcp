**I. CAPTION**
**ALBERTA DE PASION v. FLORENTINO DE PASION (ADRIANA ANCA, Intervenor-Appellant)**, G.R. No. L-15757, May 31, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
The land in litigation was covered by a Homestead Patent and registered in the name of Bernardino de Pasion (deceased) in 1929. Bernardino had a son, Ramon (father of defendant Florentino), with his first wife. He later married Epifania Anca, with whom he had no children, though Epifania had an acknowledged natural child, Alberta de Pasion (plaintiff).

After Bernardino’s death, his son Ramon executed a deed of extrajudicial partition in 1941, adjudicating the entire land to himself, resulting in the issuance of a new title in his name. Alberta filed an action to annul the partition and titles. Adriana Anca (Intervenor-Appellant), the sister of Epifania, intervened, claiming entitlement to one-half of the land as Epifania’s sole legitimate heir.

The lower court dismissed both the complaint and the intervention on the ground of prescription, ruling that the action, being based on fraud, should have been filed within four years from the 1941 registration. Only the Intervenor, Adriana Anca, appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Intervenor-Appellant (Adriana Anca) is entitled to claim the portion of the land allegedly belonging to her deceased sister, Epifania Anca.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the intervention but on different grounds.

First, the Court clarified that the lower court erred in ruling that the action had prescribed. Under the principle of **constructive trusteeship**, the right of a *cestui que trust* against a trustee who has committed a breach of trust (such as adjudicating the entire property to himself) does not prescribe. Ramon, by taking the property solely, acted as a constructive trustee for the other heirs.

However, the intervention must still fail because Adriana Anca is not the legal heir of Epifania Anca. The trial court found that Epifania had an acknowledged natural child, Alberta de Pasion. Under Articles 939 and 946 of the old Civil Code, the presence of an acknowledged natural child excludes collateral relatives (such as sisters) from intestate succession. Thus, Adriana Anca is excluded by Alberta de Pasion and has no right to claim the property.

**Decision affirmed.**
