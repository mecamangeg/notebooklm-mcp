I. CAPTION
**KENG GIOK v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-13347, August 31, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Keng Giok, a Chinese citizen born in 1921, arrived in the Philippines in 1930 and filed a petition for naturalization [1]. He is married with five children, all of whom attend school [2]. He works as the manager of Cosmopolitan Jewelry Store. His annual income was P14,250.00 in 1954, P9,054.50 in 1955, and P8,687.50 in 1956 [2, 3]. In his petition, he stated his residence as 713 Ongpin Street, Manila [4, 5]. However, during the hearing, he admitted he was actually residing at 814 Ongpin Street and had previously lived at 706 Ongpin Street (1942) and 428 Batangas Street (1945) [4]. None of these former addresses were listed in his petition [4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila denied the petition, ruling that he failed to state all former places of residence and lacked a lucrative trade [3, 6, 7]. Keng Giok appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner's failure to state all former places of residence in the petition bars his naturalization.
2. W/N an annual income of P8,687.50 with a wife and five children constitutes a lucrative trade.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473) explicitly requires a petition for citizenship to set forth not only the present but also the former places of residence of the petitioner [5]. This requirement is mandatory to facilitate the investigation of the petitioner's character and activities by the government and private individuals in the localities where they lived [5, 8]. The Court ruled that the petitioner's omission of his former addresses in Manila falsified the truth and indicated a lack of good moral character, disqualifying him from citizenship [5]. The argument that all residences were within Manila does not excuse non-compliance, as the law makes no distinction [5].

2. **NO.** The Court held that an annual income of P8,687.50 (in 1956) is not considered lucrative for a petitioner who has a wife and five children of school age to support and owns no real estate [9-11]. "Lucrative" means substantial, and given the high cost of living and the low purchasing power of the peso, the petitioner's diminishing income was deemed insufficient to meet the requirement of Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 [3, 11].

**The decision of the lower court is affirmed.**
