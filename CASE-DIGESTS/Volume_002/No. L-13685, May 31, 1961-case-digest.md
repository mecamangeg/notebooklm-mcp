I. CAPTION
**QUIRICO CAMUS v. THE CIVIL SERVICE BOARD OF APPEALS, ET AL.**
G.R. No. L-13685, May 31, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Quirico Camus, the Administrative Officer of the Bureau of Public Works, was administratively charged for signing applications to import asphalt and opening a letter of credit for the Bureau without the Bureau providing the necessary funds. The Commissioner of Civil Service found him guilty of "gross misconduct," suspending him for two months without pay and demoting him.

Camus appealed to the Civil Service Board of Appeals (CSBA). The CSBA affirmed the decision but observed that Camus merely committed an "error of judgment" acting in "good faith" under the belief he was authorized, and that the government suffered no loss. Camus then filed a petition for Certiorari and Mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the Commissioner had the power to impose the penalties and that Camus failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not appealing the CSBA decision to the President. Camus appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is guilty of gross misconduct.
2. W/N the petition is premature for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner is guilty only of **simple negligence**, not gross misconduct. "Misconduct in office implies a wrongful intention and not a mere error of judgment" (*In re Horilleno*). Since the CSBA itself found that the petitioner's acts were done in good faith, were not motivated by ulterior or selfish purposes, and resulted in no loss to the government, these acts constitute only an error of judgment. Acts done in good faith cannot be characterized as gross misconduct [1].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that there was **substantial compliance** with the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies. Although the petitioner did not formally appeal the CSBA decision to the President as provided in C.A. No. 598, he sent two letters to the President requesting reinstatement, which were subsequently denied by the Cabinet. Therefore, the action was not premature, and the trial court properly acquired jurisdiction [2].

**Disposition:** The decision of the lower court is AFFIRMED insofar as it is not incompatible with the Court's findings; Petitioner is declared guilty of simple negligence only.
