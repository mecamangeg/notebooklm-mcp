I. CAPTION
HAP HONG HARDWARE CO., INC. v. PHILIPPINE MILLING COMPANY, G.R. No. L-16778, May 23, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Hap Hong Hardware Co., Inc. (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Philippine Milling Company (Defendant) to recover P2,084.90, representing the unpaid balance for hardware materials delivered. The Defendant admitted the purchase and the initial payment of P200.00 but denied the unpaid balance.

The trial was initially set for July 1956 but was postponed multiple times. notably twice at the instance of the Defendant. The hearing was eventually reset to January 3, 1957. On the day of the trial, the Defendant filed another motion for postponement, alleging that its witnesses (company officers) could not attend because the milling season in San Jose, Mindoro Occidental had begun and their presence at the central was necessary. The Defendant failed to appear at the hearing. Consequently, the trial court denied the motion, allowed the Plaintiff to present evidence *ex parte*, and rendered judgment in favor of the Plaintiff. The Defendant appealed, arguing that the denial of the postponement deprived it of its day in court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in denying the Defendant’s motion for postponement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court was perfectly justified in denying the motion. Postponements lie within the discretion of the court. The Court noted that the Defendant had secured various postponements prior to the last hearing date, indicating an intention to delay the case. Furthermore, the reason adduced—the milling season—was not unavoidable or unforeseen; the Defendant ought to have known the schedule long before the trial date. The motion should have been presented well in advance to avoid inconvenience to the adverse party, yet it was presented only on the day of the trial.

The appeal is DISMISSED, and the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED.
