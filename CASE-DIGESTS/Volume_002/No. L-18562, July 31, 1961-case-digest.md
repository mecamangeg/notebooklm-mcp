I. CAPTION
UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES, ET AL. v. THE CITY FISCAL OF QUEZON CITY, G.R. No. L-18562, July 31, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Tomas S. Fonacier and Leopoldo Y. Yabes were the editor and managing editor, respectively, of the *Philippine Social Sciences and Humanities Review*, a scholarly publication of the University of the Philippines. In its Golden Jubilee issue published in July 1959, the *Review* featured an article titled "The Peasant War in the Philippines."

On June 7, 1961, Carlos Albert filed a complaint with the respondent City Fiscal of Quezon City, charging Fonacier and Yabes with incitement to sedition under Article 142 of the Revised Penal Code. After a preliminary investigation, the City Fiscal threatened to file a criminal information against them. Petitioners filed an original action for prohibition with preliminary injunction before the Supreme Court, arguing that the filing of the information constituted harassment, was oppressive, and infringed upon their academic freedom.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the City Fiscal may be enjoined or prohibited from filing a criminal information against the petitioners.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the petition. It is the sworn duty of the Fiscal to conduct an investigation upon the filing of a complaint and to file the corresponding information if the evidence shows that a criminal offense has been committed and the party charged is probably guilty.

The general rule is that neither an injunction nor a writ of prohibition may be issued by the courts to restrain a criminal prosecution (*Kwong Sing vs. City of Manila*, 41 Phil. 103). An exception exists only in extreme cases where it is necessary for the orderly administration of justice or to prevent the use of the strong arm of the law in an oppressive or vindictive manner (*Dimayuga vs. Fernandez*, 43 Phil. 304). The Court found that the facts alleged did not prove that the Fiscal's action would be oppressive or vindictive. On the contrary, the presumption is that the Fiscal's decision to file the information was justified by the evidence presented during the preliminary investigation, in accordance with the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty.

Accordingly, the petition for preliminary injunction and the main petition for prohibition were denied for lack of merit.
