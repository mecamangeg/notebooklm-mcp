**I. CAPTION**
**REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES (Represented by the Land Tenure Administration) v. GORGONIA VDA. DE CALIWAN**, G.R. No. L-16927, May 31, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
The Republic acquired the Fabie Estate in Manila under Republic Act No. 1162 for subdivision and sale to *bona fide* tenants or occupants [1]. The Land Tenure Administration (LTA) administered the estate. A survey showed Lot 10, Block 41 was vacant, but Gorgonia Vda. de Caliwan later entered without permission and built a *barong-barong* (makeshift house) despite posted notices prohibiting entry [2, 3]. Meanwhile, the LTA allocated the lot to Perfecto Magaway, a lawful tenant displaced by road construction within the estate [2]. When Caliwan refused to vacate, the LTA filed ejectment proceedings [3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ordered Caliwan to vacate [3]. She appealed, arguing that even as a "squatter," she was an actual "occupant" under RA 1162 and entitled to priority over Magaway [4, 5]. The Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved a question of law [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a squatter or illegal entrant is considered an "occupant" entitled to the benefits of expropriation under Republic Act No. 1162. [4]

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that persons guilty of illegal entry, such as squatters, cannot invoke the benefits of expropriation laws. The Court cited established jurisprudence (*Enriquez v. Panlilio* and *Bernardo v. Bernardo*) stating that the purpose of such laws (like Commonwealth Acts Nos. 20 and 539) is to aid lawful tenure, not to benefit the lawless or cloak bad faith [6-8]. RA 1162 is *in pari materia* with these acts; thus, the term "occupant" must be understood as "bona fide occupant" even if not explicitly qualified in the text [9]. Legislative records for House Bill No. 930 (the source of RA 1162) disclose no intent to benefit squatters [9]. The government's policy regarding squatters is relocation, not the sale of landholdings to them [10].

The judgment appealed from is **AFFIRMED**. [11]
