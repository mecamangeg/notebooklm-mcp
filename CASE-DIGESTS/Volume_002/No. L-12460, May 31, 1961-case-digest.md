I. CAPTION
MARCOS ABIG, ET AL. v. EUSEBIO CONSTANTINO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-12460, May 31, 1961, 2 SCRA 299, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On February 11, 1946, Eusebio Constantino filed a homestead application for a 24-hectare parcel of land in Solana, Cagayan, reconstituting a previous 1924 application lost during the war. During a relocation survey, petitioners Marcos Abig, Honorata Cagumbay, and Lino Pagulayan claimed portions of the land, alleging possession since 1921. The Bureau of Lands investigated the adverse claims.

Prior to the administrative decision, Constantino had filed an unlawful detainer case against Abig and an action to quiet title against the others. These cases were abandoned or dismissed after the parties agreed in writing to submit themselves to the decision of the Bureau of Lands and the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DANR). The Bureau of Lands eventually ruled in favor of Constantino, finding the petitioners were mere tenants or croppers. The DANR affirmed this decision.

Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cagayan, alleging the administrative officials acted with grave abuse of discretion. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the findings of fact by the administrative officials were based on evidence and thus conclusive. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the findings of fact and decision of the Director of Lands and Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources may be reviewed by certiorari.
2. W/N the petitioners are estopped from attacking the administrative decision.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that a petition for certiorari must be based on jurisdictional grounds. As long as the respondent acted with jurisdiction, errors in the appreciation of evidence or conclusions of fact amount only to errors of judgment, which are reviewable by appeal, not certiorari [1, 2]. Abuse of discretion justifies certiorari only if it is "grave," meaning capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment equivalent to lack of jurisdiction [3]. Furthermore, findings of fact by the Director of Lands, when approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, are conclusive upon the courts in the absence of fraud, imposition, or mistake other than error of judgment in estimating the value of evidence (*Urtua v. Singson*) [4, 5].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the petitioners are in estoppel to attack the decision of the public officials. The parties had previously agreed in writing in the antecedent court cases (unlawful detainer and quiet title) to respect and submit to the decision of the Bureau of Lands and the DANR regarding the homestead application [6, 7]. Additionally, regarding the alleged violation of Section 90 of the Public Land Act, the Court sustained the Secretary's finding that the petitioners were merely "croppers" or employees receiving a share of crops as wages, not tenants with an estate in the land, and thus the arrangement did not violate the homestead law [8].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED**.
