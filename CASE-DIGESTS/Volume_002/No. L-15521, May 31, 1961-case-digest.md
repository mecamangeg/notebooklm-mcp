I. CAPTION
MANILA JOCKEY CLUB, INC. v. N. BAENS DEL ROSARIO, as Associate Commissioner of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission, and BERNARDO S. REYES, G.R. No. L-15521, May 31, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Bernardo S. Reyes, a jockey, filed a claim for workmen's compensation against petitioner Manila Jockey Club, Inc. after suffering an injury from a fall during a race on March 31, 1957 [1, 2]. The hearing officer ruled in favor of Reyes, holding that he was an employee of the petitioner and awarding him compensation [2, 3]. Petitioner sought review from the Workmen’s Compensation Commission [4]. Respondent Associate Commissioner N. Baens Del Rosario rendered a decision modifying the award but maintaining the petitioner's liability [4, 5]. Instead of seeking reconsideration by the Commission *en banc*, petitioner filed a petition for certiorari directly with the Supreme Court [5]. Respondents moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was premature [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal to the Supreme Court is premature for failing to seek reconsideration by the Workmen's Compensation Commission *en banc*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the appeal was premature. Under the Rules of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission, specifically Section 3, Rule 24 and Section 1, Rule 25, a party aggrieved by the decision of an individual Commissioner should first seek a reconsideration of the decision by the Commission *en banc* [6, 7]. It is only when the decision of the Commission *en banc* is adverse that the party may appeal to the Supreme Court [6]. Since the petitioner failed to exhaust this administrative remedy, the petition for review was improper.

Appeal dismissed [8].
