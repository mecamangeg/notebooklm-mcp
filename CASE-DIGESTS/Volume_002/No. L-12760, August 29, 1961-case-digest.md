I. CAPTION
J. M. TUASON & CO., INC. v. REGISTER OF DEEDS OF QUEZON CITY and CORNELIO M. AGUILA, G.R. No. L-12760, August 29, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. is the registered owner of a parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 1267 in Quezon City. On July 7, 1956, respondent Cornelio M. Aguila requested the Register of Deeds to annotate an adverse claim on the petitioner's title pursuant to Section 110 of Act No. 496. Aguila claimed to have purchased 1,400 square meters of the land from Florencio Deudor in 1951. He alleged that the original registration of the land in 1914 was fraudulent because the land truly belonged to Telesforo Deudor (Florencio's predecessor) under a possessory information title dated 1893.

The Register of Deeds annotated the adverse claim on the petitioner's entire title—covering over 5 million square meters—because Aguila failed to provide a technical description of the specific 1,400 square meters he claimed. Petitioner filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to cancel the adverse claim. The CFI, acting as a land registration court, granted the petition and ordered Aguila to pay treble costs for filing a frivolous claim. Aguila appealed, arguing that the lower court should have heard the case as a court of general jurisdiction rather than a land court, and that his claim was valid.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court, acting as a land registration court, had jurisdiction to hear the petition for cancellation.
2. W/N an adverse claim based on a right allegedly existing prior to the original registration is registrable under Section 110 of Act No. 496.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the lower court properly exercised its limited jurisdiction as a land registration court. The appellant himself invoked Section 110 of Act No. 496 in his specific request to the Register of Deeds for the annotation of his adverse claim. Furthermore, the petitioner's motion for cancellation was also expressly based on Section 110. Since the proceedings for both the annotation and the cancellation were grounded in the Land Registration Act, the court had the authority to determine the validity of the adverse claim under that specific provision [1].

2. **NO.** Section 110 of Act No. 496 explicitly provides that an adverse claim must consist of a right or interest arising **subsequent** to the date of the original registration. The Court reasoned that under this section, the validity of the original registration is assumed, and the land registration court cannot pass upon it. Aguila's claim was based on the alleged title of Telesforo Deudor dating back to 1893, while the original registration of the subject land occurred in 1914. Because Aguila's alleged right arose *before* the original registration, it does not qualify as a registrable adverse claim under Section 110 [2-5]. Additionally, the Court affirmed the award of treble costs, finding the claim frivolous and vexatious because Aguila allowed the annotation to encumber the entire estate despite claiming only a minute portion, causing the petitioner irreparable injury [6, 7].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed [8].
