I. CAPTION
**IN RE: PETITION OF ARTURO EFREN GARCIA for admission to the Philippine Bar without taking the examination**, August 15, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Arturo Efren Garcia, a Filipino citizen, finished the law course in Spain and graduated as "Licenciado En Derecho" from the Central University of Madrid. He was authorized to practice law in Spain. Garcia filed a petition with the Philippine Supreme Court to be admitted to the practice of law in the Philippines without taking the required Bar examinations. He invoked the privileges under the "Treaty on Academic Degrees and the Exercise of Professions" between the Philippines and Spain, arguing that his credentials entitle him to practice in the Philippines [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a Filipino citizen who finished a law course in Spain may be admitted to the Philippine Bar without taking the examinations based on the Treaty on Academic Degrees and the Exercise of Professions.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the petition. The Court held that the Treaty invoked by Garcia does not exempt him from the Bar examinations for two reasons:

1.  **Nationality and Reciprocity:** Under Article 11 of the Treaty, the privileges are intended for nationals of one country desiring to practice in the *other* country (i.e., Filipinos in Spain or Spaniards in the Philippines). Since Garcia is a Filipino citizen desiring to practice in the Philippines, he is subject to the laws of his own country and is not entitled to privileges extended to Spanish nationals [2, 3].
2.  **Constitutional Prerogative:** The Treaty cannot modify the regulations governing admission to the Philippine Bar. The Executive Department cannot encroach upon the Supreme Court's constitutional prerogative to promulgate rules for admission to the practice of law. Under Section 13, Article VIII of the 1935 Philippine Constitution, the power to repeal, alter, or supplement such rules is reserved solely to the Congress of the Philippines, not the Executive via treaty [4, 5].

**Petition denied.**
