I. CAPTION
**COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. ST. STEPHEN’S ASSOCIATION, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-15562, May 31, 1961, Bengzon, C.J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
St. Stephen’s Association (Association) was organized in 1931 to support and maintain St. Stephen’s School (School), which was originally founded by the St. Stephen's Church [3, 4]. To address the School's financial difficulties, the Association solicited voluntary contributions from church members and the Chinese community, collecting an aggregate of P50,000 earmarked as an Endowment Fund [4]. From this fund, the Association transferred P9,252.48 to the School [5]. The Collector of Internal Revenue assessed a gift tax on this transfer, arguing it was a donation by the Association. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled in favor of the Association, holding that the transfer was not a gift by the Association but by the individual contributors, and since no individual gave more than P1,000, no tax was due [5, 6]. The Collector appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the transfer of P9,252.48 from the Association to the School constitutes a taxable gift by the Association. [5, 6]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's decision. The Court held that the money transferred was not a gift by the Association but a gift by the various persons who contributed to the Endowment Fund [6, 7]. The Association merely held the funds in trust, being under an obligation to give them to the School in compliance with the purpose of the contributions [5]. Since the transfer was legally a gift by the individual contributors, and it was established that none of said contributors had given more than P1,000, no donor’s or donee’s tax was demandable under the Tax Code [7, 8].

**Judgment affirmed.** [7]
