I. CAPTION
PACIANO M. MIRALLES, ET AL. v. FRANCISCO G. GARIANDO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16584, May 23, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Miralles, et al. and Respondents Gariando, et al. were rival candidates for mayor, vice-mayor, and councilors in Alangalang, Leyte during the November 10, 1959 elections [1]. Petitioners alleged that Respondents failed to file valid certificates of candidacy, submitting only unsigned mimeographed copies [1]. On November 19, 1959, Petitioners filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus with the Court of First Instance of Leyte to enjoin the municipal board of canvassers from canvassing the votes and to compel the board to proclaim Petitioners as the duly elected officials [1]. The trial court dismissed the petition, ruling that Respondents had duly filed their certificates and that the court could not interfere with the board's duties [2, 3]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the court may intervene to prevent the municipal board of canvassers from complying with its duty to canvass votes based on the alleged invalidity of candidates' certificates of candidacy.
2. W/N the remedy of mandamus and prohibition is proper to question the eligibility of candidates.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court cannot intervene to prevent the board from fulfilling its duties. Under Section 168 of the Revised Election Code, the municipal board of canvassers has the "imperative duty" to meet immediately after the election, count the votes from the election statements, and proclaim the winners [4]. This duty is purely ministerial and mechanical; the board cannot open ballot boxes or judge the validity of certificates, but must rely exclusively on the election returns [4]. Courts are barred from intervening in this process except in specific cases provided by Section 163 of the Revised Election Code, which does not apply in this instance [4].

2. **NO.** The proper remedy is *quo warranto*. If a winning candidate is ineligible due to a failure to properly file a certificate of candidacy, the specific remedy provided by law is to contest the election under Section 173 of the Revised Election Code [5]. However, this remedy must be availed of within one week after the proclamation of the winning candidate [5].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [6].
