I. CAPTION
NATIONAL RICE & CORN CORPORATION (NARIC) v. JUAN ANTONIO and THE CAPITAL INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-11926, June 30, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On December 29, 1951, NARIC approved an application in the name of Juan Antonio to purchase empty sacks, conditioned on the filing of a P2,000 surety bond. The Capital Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. (Surety) issued the bond, and the sacks were delivered on January 2, 1952. An indemnity agreement was allegedly signed by Antonio and Carmen Loriaga in favor of the Surety. When the obligation was not paid, NARIC sued Antonio and the Surety. Both Antonio and Loriaga (impleaded as third-party defendant) were declared in default.

The trial court rendered a decision on September 10, 1955, ordering the Surety to pay NARIC and Antonio/Loriaga to indemnify the Surety. On January 14, 1956, the Surety satisfied the judgment by paying NARIC P2,656.62. However, on March 5, 1956, Antonio filed a petition for relief from judgment, claiming he was never served summons and that his signatures were forgeries. The trial court set aside the entire decision. After a new trial, the court rendered a second decision on December 17, 1956: (1) dismissing the case against Antonio upon finding he was impersonated; (2) ordering the Surety to pay NARIC P2,000 again; and (3) ordering NARIC and the Surety to pay Antonio damages and attorney's fees for filing the suit. NARIC and the Surety appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in setting aside the first decision against the Surety and ordering it to pay NARIC again.
2. W/N NARIC and the Surety are liable for damages to Antonio for filing the complaint and cross-claim.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court erred in setting aside the original decision insofar as it affected the Surety. First, the Surety had not filed any petition for relief; second, the Surety had already satisfied the judgment [1, 2]. Consequently, it was erroneous to sentence the Surety in the second decision to pay the sum it had already paid under the first decision [3]. The order setting aside the decision was valid only regarding Antonio, who successfully proved the court lacked jurisdiction over his person due to lack of summons [4].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that NARIC and the Surety are not liable for damages and attorney's fees. The evidence showed they acted in good faith and were themselves victims of fraud by the impersonator who forged Antonio's signature [5, 6]. At the time they filed their claims, they had no knowledge of the forgery and were in the legitimate exercise of their rights [6].

**Disposition:** The appealed decision is **MODIFIED**. The dismissal of the case against Antonio is affirmed. The award of damages against NARIC and the Surety is reversed. The order for the Surety to pay NARIC is reversed as the obligation was already satisfied. The liability of Loriaga to indemnify the Surety stands [7, 8].
