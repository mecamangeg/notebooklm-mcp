I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MAXIMINO GUMAYAN and PEOPLE’S SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY, G.R. No. L-16780, May 31, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Defendant Maximino Gumayan, licensed to store palay, posted three bonds issued by People’s Surety & Insurance Company to insure the return of palay to depositors [1, 2]. In turn, Gumayan executed indemnity agreements in favor of the Surety—one signed alone and another jointly with Pablo H. Hinon—covering two of the three bonds (Bond Nos. 35 and 82) [2, 3]. These agreements stipulated indemnity for damages, costs, 15% attorney’s fees, and 12% interest in case of delay [2].

The Republic sued Gumayan and the Surety for failing to return 2,733 cavans of palay [4]. On the trial date, Gumayan’s counsel was absent, having filed a motion for postponement only three days prior to attend an administrative case [5]. The trial court denied the motion, allowed the plaintiff to present evidence, and rendered judgment against the defendants [5, 6]. The court also granted the Surety's cross-claim against Gumayan and third-party complaint against Hinon but failed to include the stipulated interest and attorney's fees [6, 7]. Gumayan appealed the denial of his postponement, while the Surety appealed to enforce the indemnity stipulations [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in denying Gumayan’s motion for postponement.
2. W/N the Surety is entitled to recover attorney’s fees and interest based on the indemnity agreements.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that motions for postponement are addressed to the sound discretion of the court, and a movant has no right to assume the motion will be granted, especially when filed with less than three days' notice [7, 9]. Gumayan’s counsel provided no valid reason to prioritize an administrative case over the trial, and the motion was served by mail too late for the other parties to receive proper notice [9]. Thus, the denial was not an abuse of discretion.

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the terms of the indemnity agreements are binding on the parties [10]. Gumayan and Hinon expressly agreed to pay costs, 15% attorney's fees, and 12% interest in case of delay [11, 12]. Consequently, the judgment was modified to order Gumayan to pay these additional amounts for the bonds covered by the agreements (Nos. 35 and 82), and Hinon for the bond he secured (No. 35) [3, 13]. For the third bond (No. 67), which was not covered by an indemnity agreement, the Surety is entitled only to reimbursement [13].

The judgment was **MODIFIED** regarding the amounts due to the Surety and **AFFIRMED** in all other respects [14, 15].
