I. CAPTION
AMERICAN MAIL LINE, ET AL. v. CITY OF BASILAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-12647, May 31, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On September 12, 1955, the City Council of Basilan enacted Ordinance No. 180, Series of 1955, amending Ordinance No. 7 [1]. The new ordinance imposed an "anchorage fee" on foreign vessels engaged in coastwise trade anchoring within the city's territorial waters [2]. The fee was set at 1/2 centavo (P0.005) per registered gross ton for the first 24 hours, with a maximum charge of P75.00 per day [2].

The plaintiffs, foreign shipping companies, filed an action for Declaratory Relief, arguing the ordinance was invalid [3]. The City of Basilan (defendants) contended that the ordinance was a valid exercise of its legislative powers under its Charter (Republic Act No. 288) to levy taxes or fix charges for watercraft, or alternatively, an exercise of police power for regulatory purposes [4-6]. The Court of First Instance of Manila declared the ordinance illegal and void [1]. The City appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the City of Basilan has the authority to enact Ordinance No. 180 and collect anchorage fees from foreign vessels.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The City of Basilan lacks the authority to enact the subject ordinance.

First, under Section 14(a) of its Charter (R.A. 288), the City may only levy taxes "for general and special purposes in accordance with law" [5]. This does not grant a blanket power of taxation; the phrase "in accordance with law" limits this power, and there is no specific law authorizing such an anchorage fee [7]. Second, Section 14(v), which authorizes the City to fix charges for watercraft "landing at or using public wharves, docks, levees, or landing places," does not encompass the power to collect "anchorage" fees for vessels merely anchoring in open bays or channels [7, 8].

Third, regarding police power, the power to regulate does not include the power to impose fees for revenue purposes [6]. To be valid as a regulatory fee, the amount must be no more than sufficient to cover the actual cost of inspection or regulation (*Manila Electric Co. v. Auditor General*) [6]. Here, the fees are clearly for revenue purposes because: (1) they are based on tonnage and have no reasonable relation to the cost of inspection; (2) the P75.00 maximum exceeds the P50.00 harbor fee imposed by the National Government; and (3) the City admitted the fees would generate "considerable amounts" and argued it was an exercise of taxation power [9, 10].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [10].
