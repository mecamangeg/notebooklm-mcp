I. CAPTION
JUAN CRUZ, JR. v. CRISANTO DIAZ, G.R. No. L-15740, May 23, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Juan Cruz, Jr. alleged that in December 1953, defendant Crisanto Diaz executed a public instrument transferring all his homestead rights over a parcel of land in Davao to Cruz for a consideration. Cruz subsequently took possession, cultivated the land, and introduced improvements worth P10,000. However, in 1954, Diaz fraudulently obtained an Original Certificate of Title (OCT) over the land by misrepresenting to the authorities that he had not transferred his rights. Cruz demanded the surrender of the title, but Diaz refused.

Cruz filed a complaint for the annulment of the patent and title, damages, and "such further and equitable remedy as may be deemed proper." The Director of Lands intervened, supporting the cancellation of the title as the transfer violated the Public Land Act. The lower court granted Diaz's Motion to Dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to state a cause of action, reasoning that: (1) only the government may seek reversion; (2) the one-year period to review the decree of registration had prescribed; and (3) if Diaz’s title were nullified, Cruz would have no rights to derive from him.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the complaint states a sufficient cause of action to survive a motion to dismiss.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the complaint sufficiently states a cause of action. First, the lower court overlooked the second cause of action regarding damages, which was distinct from the issue of the title's validity [1]. Second, regarding the land dispute, the Motion to Dismiss hypothetically admitted the truth of the complaint's allegations, including the validity of the transfer of rights from Diaz to Cruz [2].

Although the specific prayer was for the annulment of the title (which might be barred or improper), the general prayer for "further and equitable remedy" allows the court to grant appropriate relief warranted by the facts alleged [2, 3]. Under the doctrine in *Tolentino v. Baltazar*, if the transfer of rights was valid, the plaintiff is entitled to compel the defendant to execute a deed of conveyance and assignment of the land covered by the certificate of title [2, 3]. Thus, the allegations were sufficient to justify this equitable relief.

The order of dismissal is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED to the lower court for further proceedings [4].
