I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. BIENVENIDO A. TAN, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila and LIM HOA alias LIM HOA TING, G.R. No. L-16014, May 23, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Lim Hoa was charged with unfair competition under Article 189 of the Revised Penal Code for selling "Lantern Brand Food Seasoning" with packaging intended to deceive the public into believing it was "Oak Barrel Brand Food Seasoning" [1]. Previously, Judge Tan granted a motion to quash the information, but the Supreme Court reversed this in G.R. No. L-16012, remanding the case for trial [2].

During the trial, the prosecution presented a Food Health Inspector to testify that the actual ingredients of Lim Hoa's product did not match the label description. The defense objected, arguing this evidence did not support the allegations in the information. Judge Tan sustained the objection, barring the evidence and threatening to dismiss the case if the prosecution insisted on this theory [3]. Alleging bias and grave abuse of discretion, the prosecution filed a petition for prohibition and certiorari. During the pendency of this action, Judge Tan retired from the Bench [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for prohibition to restrain the respondent Judge is moot.
2. W/N the writ of certiorari should issue against the trial court's order barring the prosecution's evidence.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The issue regarding the prayer to restrain Judge Tan from hearing the case is moot because the respondent Judge has already retired from the Bench [4].

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that it is not proper to determine the admissibility of evidence in a special civil action for certiorari. Even if the trial court's exclusion of the evidence was erroneous, such an error would constitute a "mere mistake of judgment" rather than a grave abuse of discretion affecting the court's jurisdiction [4, 5]. Furthermore, since the trial must resume before a different judge due to Judge Tan's retirement, the new presiding judge may not share the former judge's view. Consequently, the prosecution possesses "another plain, adequate and speedy remedy in the ordinary course of law" [4].

Petition dismissed [6].
