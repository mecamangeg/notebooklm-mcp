I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MARCIANO VILLEGAS, EMIGDIO VILLEGAS, and ALFREDO VILLEGAS, G.R. No. L-16818, May 31, 1961, 2 SCRA 587, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On December 26, 1959, in San Jacinto, Pangasinan, the deceased Felix Jugo arrived at the scene where the Villegas brothers (Marciano, Emigdio, and Alfredo) were resting. Believing they had stolen his chickens, Felix rushed at Marciano and struck him with an iron pipe. Marciano, aged 36 and of larger build, managed to parry the blow and wrest the pipe from Felix, who was 60 years old. Marciano then struck Felix multiple times with the pipe, killing him. During the scuffle, Emigdio and Alfredo threw stones at Felix and his son Gabriel, but did not inflict mortal injuries or join Marciano in hitting Felix once he was down. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan convicted all three brothers of murder and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua*, giving credence to the prosecution's version of a treacherous ambush. The brothers appealed, arguing self-defense.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Marciano Villegas acted in valid self-defense.
2. W/N Emigdio and Alfredo Villegas are liable as co-principals in the killing.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Marciano Villegas is entitled only to the privileged mitigating circumstance of **incomplete self-defense**. While the Court found that unlawful aggression came from the deceased without sufficient provocation from Marciano, there was **no reasonable necessity** for the killing. The Court held that the "test of reasonableness depends not only on the character of the weapon employed, but also on the physical condition, age, size and other circumstances, pertaining to the combatants" [1]. Marciano, who was younger, taller, and bigger than the 60-year-old Felix, had already disarmed the deceased. With the presence of his two brothers, there was no impelling danger that necessitated dealing mortal blows to the disarmed victim [1]. Consequently, Marciano is liable for **Homicide**, not Murder [2].

2. **NO.** Emigdio and Alfredo are liable only as **accomplices**. The Court found no evidence of conspiracy or unity of purpose and design to make them co-principals. They merely cooperated in the execution of the offense by simultaneous acts (throwing stones) which were not indispensable to the killing (citing *People v. Tumayao*, 56 Phil. 587) [3].

**DISPOSITION:** The decision is **SET ASIDE**. Marciano Villegas is found guilty of **Homicide** with incomplete self-defense and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 4 years, 2 months of *prision correccional* to 6 years, 1 day of *prision mayor*. Emigdio and Alfredo Villegas are sentenced as **accomplices**.
