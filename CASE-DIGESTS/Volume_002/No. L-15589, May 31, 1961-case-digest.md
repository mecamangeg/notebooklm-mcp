I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SATURNINO R. ARICHETA, G.R. No. L-15589, May 31, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
The Republic of the Philippines filed an action to eject Saturnino R. Aricheta from a parcel of land located in the East Triangle of the Quezon Memorial Park, Diliman, Quezon City. The Republic alleged it owned the park, established under Proclamation No. 42 (1954) as amended, and that the land was covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 1356 in the name of the People’s Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC).

Aricheta, a lawyer, claimed ownership based on a deed of sale from Marcelino Tiburcio, who allegedly held a Spanish grant from 1877. Aricheta argued he was a purchaser in good faith and that the Republic's title was invalid. The Court of First Instance of Quezon City ruled in favor of the Republic, finding that Tiburcio’s application for registration had already been denied in a final court order. Aricheta appealed, raising issues regarding the verification of the complaint, the validity of the Republic's title, and the President's authority to create the park.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the complaint was defective for lack of verification.
2. W/N the defendant was a possessor in good faith.
3. W/N the Presidential Proclamation converting the land into a park is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The defect regarding the lack of verification in the complaint pursuant to Rule 72 cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. The defendant failed to raise this issue at the opportune time in the trial court [1-3].

2. **NO.** The defendant is an attorney-at-law and should have known that land in Quezon City is likely covered by a Torrens Title. Furthermore, the fact that his vendor (Tiburcio) did not possess a Torrens Title and merely bound himself to issue a clear title in the deed of sale should have caused the defendant to doubt the validity of the vendor's title. Consequently, he cannot claim to be a possessor in good faith [2, 4, 5].

3. **YES.** The entire land constituting the park is covered by TCT No. 1356 in the name of the PHHC. Since the land is the property of the Government of the Philippines, the authority of the President to convert the same into a park cannot be questioned [6-8].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**, with treble costs against the defendant-appellant [8].
