I. CAPTION
BARTOLOME E. SAN DIEGO v. ELIGIO SAYSON, G.R. No. L-16258, August 31, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
In November 1954, petitioner Bartolome San Diego and respondent Eligio Sayson entered into a contract where Sayson would furnish labor for the construction of a building for P15,000 [1]. During construction, the plans were modified to include extra work such as increasing the building's width and changing materials, which Sayson valued at P6,840.31 [1, 2]. San Diego refused to pay this additional amount, invoking Article 1724 of the Civil Code [1]. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Sayson, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment, holding that despite the absence of a written agreement for the alterations, justice and equity required compensation to prevent the owner's unjust enrichment [1, 3]. San Diego appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the contractor may recover the cost of additional labor resulting from changes in the plans without the written authorization of the owner.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that under Article 1724 of the Civil Code, a contractor can demand an increase in price due to changes in plans or specifications only if: (1) the change has been authorized by the proprietor in writing; and (2) the additional price has been determined in writing by both parties [4, 5]. The Court explained that this provision is not merely procedural to prohibit oral testimony (like the Statute of Frauds), but is a substantive provision and a "condition precedent to recovery" [6, 7]. The strict requirement was adopted by the legislature to prevent misunderstandings and litigation over additional costs [8]. Consequently, without written authorization, the contractor cannot recover.

The petition was **GRANTED**, the decision of the Court of Appeals was **REVERSED**, and the respondent's action was **DISMISSED** [9].
