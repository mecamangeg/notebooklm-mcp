I. CAPTION
BASILAN LUMBER COMPANY v. CAGAYAN TIMBER EXPORT COMPANY, PEOPLE’S SURETY & INSURANCE CO., and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-15908, June 30, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Basilan Lumber Company (Petitioner) entered into a contract with Cagayan Timber Export Company (Respondent) to supply logs for export. Respondent failed to deliver the agreed quantity and comply with loading conditions, resulting in Petitioner becoming liable for dead freight and demurrage amounting to $9,814.59 (P19,629.18) regarding its transaction with a Japanese buyer. The evidence showed that the Petitioner’s agent, East Asiatic Company, had already paid these damages to the Japanese buyer. However, there was no proof that Petitioner had paid East Asiatic or had been required to pay said amount.

The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Petitioner, awarding the damages. The Court of Appeals reversed this decision, dismissing the complaint on the ground that the damages were speculative because Petitioner had not yet actually paid them. Petitioner appealed, arguing that under American jurisprudence and the contract terms, liability to the buyer is sufficient to recover damages from the seller.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner can recover damages for dead freight and demurrage which it has not yet paid to the third party.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that under **Article 2199 of the Civil Code**, damages must be "duly proved." This provision, which is new and distinct from the Spanish Civil Code, denies the grant of speculative damages—those not actually proved to have existed and to have been caused to the party claiming them [1, 2].

While the evidence showed the agent (East Asiatic) paid the Japanese buyer, there was no proof that the Respondent paid the agent, or that the Petitioner had paid the agent or was demanded to do so. Until the Petitioner actually suffers the damage (by paying), the damage has not been caused to him [2]. The Court held that contract stipulations indemnifying the buyer for liability to third parties are merely declaratory of the obligation; compliance can only be demanded when the obligee actually suffers the damage or pays the same [3, 4].

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
