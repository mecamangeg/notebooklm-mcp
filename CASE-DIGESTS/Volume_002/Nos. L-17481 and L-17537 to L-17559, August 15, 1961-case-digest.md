**I. CAPTION**
LIBERATA ANTONIO ESTRADA, ET AL. v. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS and FAUSTINO F. GALVAN, G.R. Nos. L-17481 and L-17537 to L-17559, August 15, 1961, Natividad, J.

**II. FACTS**
On January 6, 1961, the Supreme Court issued a resolution ordering the manager of the Moncada Bonded Warehouse to release to petitioners their shares of palay deposits (10% of the first crop and 15% of the second crop). The warehouse manager refused to comply unless the original warehouse receipts were surrendered. Consequently, on April 12, 1961, the Court ordered respondent Faustino F. Galvan to surrender said original receipts to the manager [1-3].

However, both the manager and Galvan failed to comply. The manager insisted on the surrender of the receipts to protect the warehouse against third parties to whom the receipts might have been negotiated. Galvan, on the other hand, claimed he could not surrender the receipts because they were lost or destroyed during a fire in Divisoria and his building in Manila in May 1961. Petitioners, claiming dire need of the palay for subsistence, filed a petition to declare the manager and Galvan in contempt of court [4, 5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the warehouse manager may be compelled to release the deposited palay to the petitioners despite the non-surrender of the original warehouse receipts.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** While the excuses offered by the respondents were not without merit—as the manager has the unquestionable right to protect the warehouse's interests against receipts negotiated to innocent third parties, and Galvan's claim of loss due to fire was uncontradicted—these incidents do not constitute a valid excuse to evade compliance with the Court's order. Considering the petitioners' precarious situation and dire need for subsistence, the Court ordered the manager or owner of the Moncada Bonded Warehouse and respondent Galvan to release and deliver the palay shares to the petitioners. The release was conditioned upon the issuance by the petitioners of the corresponding receipts for the goods, dispensing with the necessity of producing and surrendering the original warehouse receipts [5-7].

Petition granted with modification.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Chief Justice Bengzon and Justice Concepcion took no part) [8].
