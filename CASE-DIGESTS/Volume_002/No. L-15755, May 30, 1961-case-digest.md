I. CAPTION
RAMONA REYES v. MARIA VILLAFLOR, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15755, May 30, 1961, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Ramona Reyes had possession of a parcel of foreshore land in Catbalogan, Samar since 1936 under a revocable permit from the Bureau of Lands [1, 2]. Defendant Maria Villaflor obtained possession of the premises through a verbal month-to-month lease contract with Reyes at P50.00 per month [2]. Villaflor paid rentals until shortly before a fire razed Catbalogan on April 1, 1957 [3]. After the fire, Reyes prevented Villaflor from rebuilding and made a formal demand to vacate on June 24, 1957, intending to construct her own building [3, 4]. Villaflor refused to vacate, filing her own application for the land with the Bureau of Lands and claiming Reyes' permit had been cancelled during the Japanese occupation in 1944 [4, 5].

Reyes filed an action for illegal detainer in the Justice of the Peace Court, which ruled in her favor [1]. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Samar affirmed the decision, ruling that the only issue in detainer is physical possession and that a tenant cannot deny the landlord's title [6, 7]. Villaflor appealed to the Supreme Court, insisting Reyes' right expired upon the alleged permit cancellation [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lessee can deny the title of the lessor in an action for illegal detainer based on an alleged defect in the lessor's title.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Supreme Court held that a tenant is prohibited from denying the title of his landlord at the time of the commencement of the relation of landlord and tenant between them [8]. This is a conclusive presumption under Rule 123, Sec. 68(b) of the Rules of Court [8].

Since Villaflor admitted entering into a verbal lease with Reyes in 1957, she is estopped from asserting that Reyes had no title or right to lease the foreshore land based on an alleged permit cancellation in 1944 [8]. The Court cited the principle that "a subtenant is estopped to deny the title of his immediate landlord" [8]. Consequently, the questions regarding the conflicting applications before the Bureau of Lands were deemed unnecessary for the resolution of the detainer case [9].

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [9].
