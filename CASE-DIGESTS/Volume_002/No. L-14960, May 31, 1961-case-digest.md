I. CAPTION
LAND SETTLEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION v. CAROLINO MUNSAYAC, G.R. No. L-14960, May 31, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant Carolino Munsayac purchased tractors from the Agricultural Machinery and Equipment Corporation (AMEC), the predecessor of the plaintiff, Land Settlement and Development Corporation (LASEDECO) [1, 2]. Munsayac failed to pay the installments due, resulting in an unpaid balance. LASEDECO filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to collect the sum of P2,185.67 (representing the balance plus accumulated interest), along with 25% attorney's fees and costs [3].

Munsayac filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the CFI lacked jurisdiction because the principal indebtedness, exclusive of interest, was only P1,927.28, which was below the jurisdictional amount of P2,000 provided under Republic Act No. 296 [4]. The CFI denied the motion and rendered judgment ordering Munsayac to pay P2,185.67 with interest and attorney's fees [5, 6]. Munsayac appealed, questioning the court's jurisdiction and the imposition of 6% interest instead of the stipulated 4% [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction over the case.
2. W/N the trial court correctly imposed a 6% interest rate instead of the stipulated 4%.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that when a party has several claims for money against another arising from different transactions, they may sue for the recovery of the total amount in a single complaint, and the totality of claims (exclusive of costs and interests) determines the jurisdictional amount [9, 10]. Additionally, consequential damages and attorney's fees, when properly recoverable, are included in the jurisdictional amount [10]. In this case, the parties also stipulated that unpaid interest would be compounded and added to the principal; thus, the accrued interest became part of the principal indebtedness [11]. The total claim of P2,185.67, therefore, exceeded the P2,000 jurisdictional threshold [11].

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the imposition of 6% interest. The stipulated 4% interest was the rate agreed upon for the payment of installments [8]. The 6% interest imposed by the trial court was a penalty for the defendant's failure to satisfy the plaintiff's valid and demandable claim after extrajudicial demand (or judicial demand) [8]. In the absence of a stipulation regarding the rate of interest in case of such default, the legal rate of 6% applies [8].

Judgment affirmed [12].
