I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. APOLONIO ANDIA, alias SOFRONIO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14862, May 31, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of August 25, 1957, in Borongan, Samar, a dispute arose when Ciriaco Andia refused to pay for tuba. Policeman Jaime Lucana intervened, resulting in a struggle where Ciriaco, Iniego, and Restituto Andia manhandled the officer. Sgt. Afable arrived to assist and chased away the appellant, Apolonio Andia, who was armed with a knife. Apolonio evaded the sergeant, returned to the scene, and stabbed Lucana while the officer was held helpless by the three brothers [1]. Lucana died shortly thereafter from multiple wounds [2]. Before his death, Lucana identified Apolonio as his assailant in a statement given to the Justice of the Peace [3]. The Court of First Instance convicted Apolonio of murder, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua*. Apolonio appealed, claiming it was his brother Iniego who killed the victim in self-defense and arguing that treachery was absent [4-6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the killing was qualified by treachery.
2. W/N the victim's dying declaration was admissible to prove the appellant's guilt.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The crime committed is murder qualified by treachery. The Court held that the accused stabbed the helpless victim while the latter was being held by the accused's brothers, thereby ensuring the execution of the crime without any risk to himself [7, 8]. The defense's argument that treachery was absent because it did not exist at the inception of the attack was untenable; the evidence showed the appellant did not participate in the initial assault but arrived later, taking advantage of the victim's helpless condition [6].

2. **YES.** Although the written statement was not signed by the victim, the testimony of the doctor and the Justice of the Peace sufficiently established the dying declaration. The Court ruled that the "character and seriousness of the wounds and the fact that death supervened shortly afterwards may be considered as circumstantial evidence of the victim’s consciousness of his impending death" [7, 9]. The Court affirmed the conviction, noting that the aggravating circumstance of disregard of rank (as the victim was a policeman on duty) was offset by the mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction [10, 11].

**Judgment affirmed.**

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
