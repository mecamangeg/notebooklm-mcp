I. CAPTION
FEARNLEY & EGER and MACONDRAY & CO., INC. v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and/or MANILA PORT SERVICE, G.R. No. L-15164, May 31, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Fearnley & Eger (a foreign shipping company) and its agent Macondray & Co., Inc. filed an action against defendants Manila Railroad Company and Manila Port Service (arrastre operator) to recover the value of missing cargo. On May 15, 1957, plaintiffs' vessel discharged five bales of cotton piece goods into the custody of the defendants in Manila. Two bales, with a CIF value of P1,708.23, were lost and not delivered to the consignee [1]. Plaintiffs paid the owner, were subrogated to their rights, and demanded payment from defendants [1]. Defendants admitted the loss but invoked Section 15 of the Management Contract between the Manila Port Service and the Bureau of Customs, which limits liability to P500.00 per package unless the value is specified and arrastre charges are paid [2]. The plaintiffs were not signatories to this Management Contract [3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of plaintiffs, awarding the full value of P1,708.23 and P400.00 in attorney's fees [4]. Defendants appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the limitation of liability under the Management Contract is binding on the plaintiffs who were not parties thereto.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that Section 15 of the Management Contract, which limits the liability of the arrastre operator to P500.00 per package unless the value is otherwise specified or manifested and the corresponding arrastre charges have been paid, is valid and binding upon the plaintiffs even if they were not parties or signatories to said contract [3, 5, 6].

In this case, the value of the two bales of cotton piece goods was not specified or manifested in the bill of lading [3]. Consequently, the defendants' liability is limited to P500.00 per bale, for a total of P1,000.00 [3]. Furthermore, because the defendants were justified in refusing to pay the full amount claimed, the award for attorney's fees was deleted [3].

**Judgment modified.** Appellants are ordered to pay Appellees the sum of P1,000.00, without costs [7].
