I. CAPTION
MARIA VELASCO and MARIA ABORDE v. CARLOS VELASCO, G.R. No. L-15129, June 30, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Exequiel Velasco died intestate in 1917, leaving three parcels of land. In 1929, defendant Carlos Velasco took possession of Parcels I and II. Parcel III became the subject of a prior litigation (Civil Case No. 833) between plaintiff Maria Aborde (daughter of Exequiel’s daughter) and Carlos Velasco. Aborde lost that case because Carlos presented documents (Annexes A, B, and C) proving the properties belonged to his father, Fr. Mariano Velasco, and were ceded to him [1, 2]. The Court of Appeals affirmed this decision, which became final [1].

Subsequently, Maria Aborde and Maria Velasco (daughter of Exequiel’s son) filed the present complaint. They sought to be declared owners of Parcels I and II, and for Aborde to be declared owner of Parcel III. They also prayed for the annulment of the judgment in the prior case (Case No. 833) regarding Parcel III, alleging it was obtained through fraud by presenting falsified documents [3, 4]. The lower court dismissed the complaint with respect to Parcel III on the grounds of *res judicata* [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action regarding Parcel III is barred by *res judicata* despite the addition of a new plaintiff.
2. W/N the previous judgment can be annulled based on the allegation that forged documents were presented during the trial.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The action is barred by *res judicata*. The Court held that the joining of new parties does not remove the case from the operation of the doctrine of *res judicata* if the party against whom the judgment is offered in evidence was a party in the first action [7, 8]. Otherwise, parties could renew litigation by simply joining new parties (citing *Peñalosa v. Tuason* and *Alzua and Arnalot v. Johnson*) [9]. Here, the new plaintiff, Maria Velasco, is a first cousin of Aborde and they share a community of interest, making her a privy to the co-plaintiff [9].

2. **NO.** The judgment cannot be annulled. The Court ruled that as a general rule, only extrinsic or collateral fraud warrants the setting aside of a judgment [10]. The alleged fraud—admission of supposedly forged documents—is *intrinsic* in character, not extrinsic [10, 11]. Once a judgment becomes final, it can no longer be annulled on the ground of intrinsic fraud [11, 12].

**Order affirmed.**
