I. CAPTION
THE EARNSHAWS DOCKS & HONOLULU IRON WORKS v. ATANACIO A. MARDO, in his capacity as Chief Hearing Officer of the Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor (Manila), RAYMUNDO POLANCOS, AGUSTIN DINIO and LUIS RAMOS, G.R. No. L-14759, July 31, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents-appellants Raymundo Polancos, Agustin Dinio, and Luis Ramos filed a complaint in Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor against petitioner-appellee Earnshaws Docks & Honolulu Iron Works, claiming overtime pay, attorney’s fees, and damages [1]. Petitioner-appellee filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, arguing the regional office had no authority to hear money claims [1]. Respondent Chief Hearing Officer Atanacio A. Mardo denied the motion [1].

Petitioner-appellee then filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to declare Reorganization Plan No. 20-A and the Rules and Regulations No. 1 unconstitutional and void [1]. The CFI rendered judgment holding that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A was void insofar as it granted judicial or quasi-judicial powers to the regional office, and permanently enjoined the hearing officer from proceeding with the claims [2]. Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Reorganization Plan No. 20-A validly vests the Regional Offices of the Department of Labor with original and exclusive jurisdiction over money claims of laborers.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that the provisions of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, particularly Section 25, which empowers and vests in regional offices original and exclusive jurisdiction over money claims of laborers, are not authorized by Republic Act No. 997 [3]. Consequently, these provisions are null and void [3, 4]. The Court relied on the precedent set in *Corominas, et al. vs. Labor Standards Commission* and related cases [3].

Judgment affirmed [5].
