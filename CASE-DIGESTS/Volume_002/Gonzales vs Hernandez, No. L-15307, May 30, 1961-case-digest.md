I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CONSTANTINO DUEÑAS, FELIPE GONZALES, JUANITO TOBIAS, ANGEL FLORES, SOFRONIO DAGAMI, PABLO ROXAS and CUSTODIO MAINAR, G.R. No. L-15307, May 30, 1961, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On February 16, 1958, a fight occurred in the National Penitentiary (Muntinglupa) between the "Sigue-sigue" gang (Manila boys) in Brigade 3-A and the "OXO" gang (Visayans and Ilocanos) in Brigade 3-D [1]. Seeking revenge, members of the "OXO" gang, including the appellants, broke out of their brigade the following morning to attack Brigade 3-A. However, they failed to enter as the door was locked [2].

While outside, appellant Constantino Dueñas was seen leading Carlos de los Reyes (a "Sigue-sigue" member and "ranchero") from Brigade 3-B. As they approached the fire escape, appellant Felipe Gonzales suddenly struck De los Reyes on the head with a piece of wood, and appellant Juanito Tobias stabbed him in the chest. Appellants Sofronio Dagami and Pablo Roxas then helped lower the body down the fire escape [2, 3]. The trial court convicted all seven appellants of murder and sentenced them to death [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N all appellants are criminally liable for the death of De los Reyes based on conspiracy.
2. W/N the crime committed is murder punishable by death.

IV. RULING
1. **NO** for appellants Flores, Dagami, Roxas, and Mainar; **YES** for appellants Dueñas, Gonzales, and Tobias. The Court held that the conspiracy was specifically to attack the inmates of Brigade 3-A, not to kill De los Reyes or any "Manila boy" they encountered [5]. Since the attack on De los Reyes was not part of the original agreement and was not induced by the co-accused, only the actual perpetrators are responsible. Dueñas (who led the victim out), Gonzales (who struck the victim), and Tobias (who stabbed the victim) directly participated in the killing [6]. Dagami and Roxas merely moved the body and did not participate in the attack [5].

2. **YES.** The crime is murder qualified by treachery because the attack was sudden, unprovoked, and the victim was defenseless [7]. Since the appellants were serving sentences for previous crimes at the time of the commission of the felony, the maximum period of the penalty prescribed by law must be imposed in accordance with Article 160 of the Revised Penal Code (Quasi-recidivism). The penalty for murder is *Reclusion Temporal* in its maximum period to Death; thus, the death penalty was correctly imposed [7].

**Disposition:** The judgment is AFFIRMED as to Constantino Dueñas, Felipe Gonzales, and Juanito Tobias. The judgment is SET ASIDE as to Angel Flores, Sofronio Dagami, Pablo Roxas, and Custodio Mainar, who are ACQUITTED [8].
