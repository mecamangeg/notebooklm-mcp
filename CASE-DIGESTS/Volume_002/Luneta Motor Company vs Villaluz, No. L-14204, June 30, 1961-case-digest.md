I. CAPTION
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. ROSALINDA DE LA PEÑA VDA. DE OLIVEROS, G.R. No. L-14204, June 30, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Napoleon Oliveros, a civil engineer employed by Tuazon, Hizon & Ocampo Construction Company, was killed by a laborer while directing the construction of a bridge in Bacnotan, La Union. The bridge project was owned by petitioner Manila Railroad Company (MRR). Under the contract, MRR furnished the materials while the contractor provided the labor. However, MRR exercised close supervision over the project to ensure compliance with specifications.

Respondent Rosalinda Vda. de Oliveros (widow) filed a claim for compensation against the contractor and later amended it to include MRR. MRR moved to dismiss, arguing there was no employer-employee relationship and that the claim was barred by Section 24 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act because the notice of claim was filed more than three months after the death (accident occurred Jan. 1955; MRR impleaded Sept. 1956). The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) ruled that MRR was the statutory employer and liable for compensation. MRR appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Manila Railroad Company is the statutory employer liable for the death of the contractor's employee.
2. W/N the claim for compensation is barred by the delay in filing the notice of claim under Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed that Manila Railroad Company is the statutory employer. The rule is that where the owner of an industrial or business establishment lets another execute a job directly or necessarily connected with the conduct of its usual business, and the owner retains direct supervision and control over the work, the owner becomes the statutory employer of the contractor's employees. Here, the construction of the bridge was directly connected to MRR’s transportation business, and MRR "exercised close supervision" over the construction. Thus, MRR cannot escape liability under the Workmen’s Compensation Act.

2. **NO.** The claim is not barred. While Section 24 generally requires notice within three months, Section 27 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act provides that "failure to or delay in giving notice shall not be a bar... if it is shown that the employer, his agent or representative had knowledge of the accident." The Court found that MRR's project engineer knew of the accident and even notified the Chief Train Dispatcher, yet the company failed to submit the required employer's report. Therefore, the delay in the formal notice did not bar the claim.

The decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is affirmed.
