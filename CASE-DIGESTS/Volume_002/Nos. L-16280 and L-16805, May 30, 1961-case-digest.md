I. CAPTION
ANACLETA RIVERA, HERMOGENA ALZADON, MACARIA CAPUNO, ET AL. v. FELICIDAD TALAVERA, ET AL. and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. Nos. L-16280 and L-16805, May 30, 1961, 2 SCRA 272, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Rivera et al. filed a suit for recovery of land and damages against defendants Talavera et al. in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Tarlac. During the proceedings, defendants posted several counterbonds to discharge the receivers appointed by the court. The CFI rendered judgment for plaintiffs, ordering the return of the property and payment of damages. Defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA) and posted an additional counterbond with Visayan Surety to maintain possession pending appeal.

While the appeal was pending, plaintiffs filed a "supplemental complaint" in the CFI to hold the counterbond sureties liable. Despite the sureties' objection regarding jurisdiction, the CFI declared them in default and held them liable. Meanwhile, plaintiffs also petitioned the CA to allow an application for damages against the sureties. The CA, however, issued a resolution relieving the trial court sureties from liability, ruling that the application was filed out of time because it was not made before the trial court's judgment was rendered. The CA also denied the application regarding the appeal bond. Plaintiffs appealed the CA resolution (L-16280), while the sureties filed a petition against the CFI orders (L-16805).

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CFI had jurisdiction to entertain the application for damages against the sureties while the case was pending appeal.
2. W/N the application for damages against the sureties was barred for being filed after the trial court rendered its decision.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The CFI had lost jurisdiction over the case upon the perfection of the appeal, retaining only the power to adopt conservatory measures. Under **Section 20, Rule 59 of the Rules of Court**, damages sustained during the pendency of an appeal must be claimed in the appellate court. The trial court cannot validly entertain a supplemental complaint to hold sureties liable unless the appellate court expressly allows it or refers the application to the trial court for hearing and decision. Consequently, the proceedings and award of damages by the CFI were void for lack of requisite authorization.

2. **NO.** The Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the claim was late. The Supreme Court held that the phrase "before entry of the final judgment" in **Section 20, Rule 59** signifies "not later than the date when the judgment becomes **final and executory**" (citing *Del Rosario v. Nava* and *Alliance Ins. & Surety Co. v. Piccio*). Since the CFI judgment was appealed, it was not yet final and executory. Therefore, the application for damages was seasonably made in the CA before the appellate judgment became final. The CA should have either heard the application itself or referred it to the trial court.

**Disposition:** The proceedings taken by the CFI are SET ASIDE. The supplemental complaint is ordered elevated to the CA. The CA is ordered to take action on the applications for damages against all sureties.
