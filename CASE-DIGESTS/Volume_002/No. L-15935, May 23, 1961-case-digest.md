**I. CAPTION**
**SERREE INVESTMENT v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS**, G.R. No. L-15935, May 23, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
On August 28, 1954, petitioner Serree Investment imported garlic from Hongkong, which was subjected to seizure proceedings for violating Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45. While the seizure case was pending, petitioner filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. On November 24, 1954, the Collector of Customs rendered a decision declaring the shipment forfeited. On December 29, 1954, petitioner sent a letter to the Collector requesting that action on the decision be held in abeyance until the civil case in the CFI was terminated. The letter further stated: "For the same reason, we reserve our right to appeal... in the event that the civil case is not decided in our favor" [1, 2].

After the Supreme Court ruled in a separate proceeding that the CFI had no jurisdiction over the matter, the Collector transmitted the records to the Commissioner of Customs, treating the letter as a notice of appeal. The Commissioner dismissed the appeal. Petitioner appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), which dismissed the case on the ground that the letter was not the notice of appeal required by law [3, 4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a letter reserving the right to appeal constitutes a valid notice of appeal under Section 1380 of the Revised Administrative Code.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's dismissal. Section 1380 of the Revised Administrative Code requires a person aggrieved by the decision of the Collector of Customs to give written notice "signifying his desire to have the matter reviewed by the Commissioner" [5].

The Court held that there is a distinction between a mere reservation to take an appeal and an actual notice of appeal. A reservation implies withholding a definite decision and indicates only a probable future action, whereas a notice of appeal is an explicit announcement of the intention to have the case reviewed. Petitioner's letter was conditional, stating they would appeal only if the civil case was decided against them, and simultaneously asked for the decision to be held in abeyance. The Court found it inconsistent to ask for abeyance and appeal at the same moment [6]. Since the letter did not constitute a valid notice of appeal, the timeliness of its filing was inconsequential [7].

The petition for review is **dismissed**.
