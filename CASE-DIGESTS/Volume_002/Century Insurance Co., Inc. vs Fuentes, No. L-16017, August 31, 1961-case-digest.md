I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE TOBACCO FLUE-CURING & REDRYING CORPORATION v. MANUEL SABUGO, FRUCTUOSO ALBAN, and PEDRO A. DE LEON, G.R. No. L-16017, August 31, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Manuel Sabugo filed a complaint against Philippine Tobacco Flue-Curing & Redrying Corporation (Phil. Tobacco) with Regional Office No. 1 of the Department of Labor, claiming overtime compensation for services rendered in excess of eight hours from 1951 to 1958 [1]. Phil. Tobacco filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon City to restrain the labor officials from hearing the case, arguing that Reorganization Plan 20-A, which granted regional offices jurisdiction over such claims, was null and void [1, 2]. The CFI rendered judgment on the pleadings in favor of Phil. Tobacco, ruling that Plan 20-A constituted an undue delegation of judicial power and failed to meet constitutional requirements for enacting laws [2]. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Reorganization Plan 20-A validly confers jurisdiction over money claims to Regional Offices of the Department of Labor.
2. W/N Reorganization Plan 20-A became a valid law through legislative inaction pursuant to Republic Act No. 997.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that Reorganization Plan 20-A constitutes an undue delegation of judicial power. While Republic Act No. 997 empowered the Government Survey and Reorganization Commission to create or abolish offices for the efficient conduct of government service, this power refers only to administrative functions, as the Commission was created to reorganize the Executive Branch [3]. Judicial power rests exclusively in the Supreme Court and inferior courts established by law [4]. While the legislature may confer quasi-judicial powers on administrative bodies, these must be incidental to administrative duties and cannot cover matters exclusively vested in the courts, such as the adjudication of money claims [4].

2. **NO.** The Court held that Plan 20-A never became a law because the procedure prescribed in Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. 997 violates the Constitution. Section 6(a) allowed plans to be deemed approved by legislative inaction (silence or adjournment) [5]. This contravenes the constitutional requirement that laws be enacted through positive and separate action by each House of Congress and presented to the President for approval [6, 7]. Consequently, the Regional Offices lack the authority to hear money claims or issue writs of execution [8, 9].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [9].
