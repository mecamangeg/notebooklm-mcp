I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF NG LIAM KENG alias JOSE TANGCONKONG TO BE ADMITTED CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. NG LIAM KENG alias JOSE TANGCONKONG vs. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-14146, June 30, 1961, 2 SCRA 664, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner-appellant Ng Liam Keng filed a petition for naturalization, which was dismissed "with prejudice" by the Court of First Instance of Rizal [1]. The Supreme Court initially affirmed this dismissal in a decision promulgated on April 29, 1961 [1]. Subsequently, the petitioner filed a "Motion for Partial Reconsideration," praying that the decision be reconsidered to allow him to file another application for naturalization if he possesses all qualifications and none of the disqualifications—essentially asking that the dismissal be modified to "without prejudice" [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the petition for naturalization should be modified from "with prejudice" to "without prejudice."

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court granted the motion, finding the grounds relied upon to be valid and meritorious [1, 2]. The Court amended the dispositive portion of its April 29, 1961 decision to affirm the lower court's dismissal but with the modification that it shall be "without prejudice" [3]. This allows the petitioner to file another application in accordance with law [1].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, and Natividad concurred with the resolution [3].
