I. CAPTION
**EMILIO DABLEO v. LUZON STEVEDORING CO., INC.**, G.R. No. L-15370, May 31, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Emilio Dableo, a former deckhand for Luzon Stevedoring Co., Inc., filed a pauper’s action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to collect P2,045 in unpaid overtime wages for services rendered in 1950, 1952, 1953, and 1954 [1]. He did not seek reinstatement [2]. The parties stipulated that Dableo rendered overtime services for 864 nights, but the specific number of hours per night was disputed [3].

After hearing evidence, the CFI ruled in favor of Dableo, finding he worked four hours for "one half night" and eight hours for "one night." The court ordered Luzon Stevedoring to pay P1,319.36 (balance after deducting coffee money allowance) plus attorney's fees [4]. Luzon Stevedoring appealed to the Supreme Court, assigning errors regarding the trial court's factual findings on the number of overtime hours and the validity of a release signed by Dableo [5], [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction over the claim for overtime pay.
2. W/N the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of First Instance had jurisdiction. The Supreme Court reiterated the settled rule that where the employer-employee relationship has been terminated and no reinstatement is sought, claims arising from employment (such as those under the Eight-Hour Labor Law) become mere money claims. These fall within the jurisdiction of regular courts, not the Court of Industrial Relations [2].

2. **NO.** The appeal involves questions of fact, specifically the number of overtime hours rendered, which requires a review of evidence. Additionally, the amount involved is less than P200,000. Under the Judiciary Act of 1948 (R.A. No. 296), as amended, the case falls within the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, not the Supreme Court [6], [7].

Accordingly, the appeal was remanded to the Court of Appeals for review and judgment [7].
