I. CAPTION
JAIME HERNANDEZ v. DELFIN ALBANO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17081, May 31, 1961.

II. FACTS
Respondent Congressman Delfin Albano filed five charges against Petitioner Jaime Hernandez for violations of Article 216 of the Revised Penal Code, Commonwealth Act No. 626, and Republic Act No. 265 [1]. The Manila City Fiscal assigned two assistants to conduct a preliminary investigation [1]. Hernandez moved to dismiss the charges, arguing that under Section 2, Rule 106 of the Rules of Court, a complaint must be subscribed by the "offended party," which Albano was not [1]. The motion was denied [1]. Hernandez filed a petition with the trial court to stop the investigation, but the court dismissed the petition, ruling that the fiscal had the authority to investigate even without a complaint conforming to Section 2, Rule 106 [2]. Hernandez appealed, maintaining that the complaint contemplated by the Rules is the one filed with the fiscal [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the City Fiscal has the authority to conduct a preliminary investigation based on charges not sworn to by the offended party as defined in Section 2, Rule 106 of the Rules of Court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The City Fiscal and his assistants are vested with the power to investigate all charges of crimes and violations of ordinances irrespective of whether the person who complains is the offended party [4, 5]. The law does not require that a sworn written complaint be first filed before the city fiscal to initiate an investigation, except for (1) offenses which cannot be prosecuted *de oficio* (private crimes), or (2) cases required by law to be endorsed by specified public officers [6, 7]. The charges against Hernandez did not fall under these exceptions [7].

The Court held that the "complaint" defined in Section 2, Rule 106 of the Rules of Court is the one filed in court *after* the preliminary investigation is concluded, not the initial charge filed with the fiscal to start the inquiry [8, 9]. Under Section 38-B of the Revised Charter of the City of Manila, the fiscal is authorized to investigate charges based on oral evidence or reports without a need for a previous sworn complaint [3, 7, 10]. To rule otherwise would restrict the "effective machinery in the administration of criminal justice" established by law and practice [11].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed.
