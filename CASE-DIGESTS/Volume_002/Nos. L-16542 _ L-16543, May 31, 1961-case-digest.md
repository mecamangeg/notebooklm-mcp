I. CAPTION
SEBASTIAN S. TOMACRUZ v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, FILEMON SILVA, SEVERINO MANIEGO, PEDRO SIMBULAN, JUAN MIRANDA, and LAURENTINO AUSTRIA, G.R. Nos. L-16542 & L-16543, May 31, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Filemon Silva claimed to be the landholder of a parcel of land in San Luis, Pampanga, having purchased it from spouses Jose Laxamana and Agapita Gonzales in 1957. His tenants, respondents Simbulan, Miranda, and Austria, cultivated the land with Silva defraying the planting expenses. Petitioner Sebastian Tomacruz, claiming to be the true owner, entered the land, appropriated 10 cavans of the harvest, and threatened the tenants. Silva and the tenants filed petitions with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). Tomacruz moved to dismiss, arguing that the CAR lacked jurisdiction to resolve the question of ownership and should suspend proceedings pending the outcome of a civil case regarding the land's title in the ordinary courts. The CAR denied the motion and ruled in favor of Silva, recognizing him as the landholder based on the deed of sale and ordering Tomacruz to pay damages. Tomacruz appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction to admit evidence of ownership to determine who the landholder is in a tenancy dispute.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) may, in the course of proceedings, admit evidence of ownership for the limited purpose of determining who, as between two claimants, is the landholder to whom the tenant's share should be delivered. This authority is grounded in Section 21 of Republic Act No. 1199, which grants the CAR original and exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving the dispossession of a tenant by a "third party" and the settlement of disputes arising from the landholder-tenant relationship.

The Supreme Court emphasized that for the CAR's purposes, it is sufficient that the sale of the land to the claimant (Silva) is in proper form and that he is the legal possessor. The determination of whether Tomacruz's title is superior to Silva's is a matter left for the ordinary courts to decide, but this does not divest the CAR of jurisdiction to resolve the immediate tenancy dispute.

Petition denied. Decision affirmed.
