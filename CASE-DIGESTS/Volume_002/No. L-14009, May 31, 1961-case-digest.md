**I. CAPTION**
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF SEGUNDO SY CEZAR TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. SEGUNDO SY CEZAR v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-14009, May 31, 1961, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Segundo Sy Cezar, born in Gingoog, Misamis Oriental, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu. He claimed residence in Cebu City since 1951, where he completed high school and pre-medicine [1, 2]. However, at the time of the hearing, he was studying medicine in Manila and receiving a monthly allowance of ₱100.00 from his parents, who permanently resided in Gingoog [2, 3]. He also claimed to be employed as a commercial agent for *Botica Pacifica* in Cebu, owned by his uncle, earning ₱1,800.00 annually [2]. The Government opposed the petition, questioning the court's jurisdiction regarding his residence, the credibility of his witnesses, and his lucrative trade [4]. The CFI of Cebu granted the petition [1]. The Republic appealed [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the CFI of Cebu had jurisdiction to hear the petition given the petitioner’s residence.
2. W/N the petitioner had a lucrative trade or occupation.
3. W/N the character witnesses were credible.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The CFI of Cebu lacked jurisdiction. Under Section 8 of Commonwealth Act No. 530, a petition must be filed in the CFI of the province where the petitioner has resided for at least one year immediately preceding the filing [5]. Legal residence (*animus manendi*) requires physical presence and intent to remain; to acquire a new residence, one must abandon the old one [3, 5]. The Court found that the petitioner, being a student dependent on his parents for support, retained his parents' permanent residence in Gingoog, Misamis Oriental [3]. His stay in Cebu and Manila was temporary for educational purposes, and he had not abandoned his legal residence in Gingoog [3].

2. **NO.** Even assuming the petitioner earned ₱1,800.00 per annum, this does not constitute a lucrative trade absent proof that he received free board and lodging [6, 7]. Furthermore, the employment was doubtful as he did not present an Income Tax Return and claimed to work as an agent in Cebu while studying medicine in Manila [3, 7].

3. **NO.** The credibility of the character witnesses was found wanting. There were discrepancies in the affidavits regarding how long they had known the petitioner [8]. Moreover, the witnesses testified to meeting the petitioner in Manila, a fact the petitioner himself expressly denied in his testimony [9-11]. In naturalization cases, witnesses become insurers of the petitioner's character, and when doubt exists, the benefit goes to the Government [11, 12].

**Decision reversed.** Petition for Philippine citizenship is **DENIED** [13].
