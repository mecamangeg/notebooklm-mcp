I. CAPTION
JUANITO SUAREZ v. HON. DAMASO S. TENGCO, DOMINGO DE LA ROCA, BENEDICTA UMALI and DANILO DE LA ROCA, G.R. No. L-17113, May 23, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Juanito Suarez was the defendant in Civil Case No. 1053 for damages arising from a vehicular collision involving a jeep ridden by respondents De la Roca and Umali and an automobile driven by Suarez. A separate criminal case (Criminal Case No. 1458) for the same incident was also pending against Suarez in the same court [1]. On the first day of the civil trial, the respondents (plaintiffs) called Suarez to the stand as their first witness. Suarez objected, arguing that compelling him to testify would violate his constitutional guaranty against self-incrimination solely because the criminal case based on the same acts was still pending [1]. Respondent Judge Tengco overruled the objection and directed Suarez to testify. Suarez filed a petition for prohibition to restrain the judge [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a defendant in a civil case may be compelled to take the witness stand by the adverse party despite the pendency of a criminal case against him involving the same facts.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that no legal impediment exists against a litigant calling any of the adverse parties to be his witness, as expressly authorized by Section 83, Rule 123 of the Rules of Court [2].

The Court distinguished the rule in criminal cases from other proceedings. In a criminal case, the accused may not be compelled to take the stand or utter a word [3]. However, in civil or administrative cases, the privilege against self-incrimination is considered an "option of refusal" rather than a "prohibition of inquiry" [3]. Consequently, the privilege cannot be invoked to decline taking the stand entirely; it must be invoked only when a specific question calling for an incriminating answer is propounded [4]. This is because, prior to the question being asked, there is no way to determine if the information elicited will be incriminating [4]. Furthermore, the civil action is regarded by law (Art. 2177, Civil Code) as entirely separate and distinct from the criminal action [5].

The petition was denied [6].
