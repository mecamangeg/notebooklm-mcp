I. CAPTION
INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE LATE DON GIL MONTILLA. MERCEDES MONTILLA v. GERTRUDES MONTILLA, G.R. No. L-14462, June 30, 1961, De Leon, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Gil Montilla died on July 20, 1946 [2]. In 1947, his widow, Mercedes Montilla, was appointed administratrix of his estate [2, 3]. In 1955, Gertrudes Montilla intervened, claiming to be an acknowledged natural child of the deceased [3]. To prove her status, she presented: (1) an entry in a parish marriage book; (2) private letters from Gil Montilla addressing her as his daughter; and (3) the will of Gil’s sister, Petronila, referring to Gertrudes as Gil's daughter [4]. The Court of First Instance applied the Old Civil Code (Civil Code of 1889) and denied the intervention, ruling the evidence insufficient [5]. Gertrudes appealed, arguing that the New Civil Code should apply retroactively under Article 2253 to favor her recognition [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the New Civil Code applies to the acknowledgment of a natural child when the parent died before its effectivity.
2. W/N the evidence presented is sufficient to establish acknowledgment under the applicable law.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The rights to the inheritance of a person who died before the effectivity of the New Civil Code are governed by the Civil Code of 1889 [7]. Gil Montilla died on July 20, 1946, prior to the August 30, 1950 effectivity of the New Civil Code [8]. The Court held that Article 2263, a specific transitional provision for inheritance, requires the application of the Old Civil Code and prevails over the general transitional provision of Article 2253 [6]. Furthermore, acknowledgment is not a new right declared for the first time in the New Code, rendering Article 2253 inapplicable [6, 9].

2. **NO.** Under Article 131 of the Old Civil Code, acknowledgment of a natural child must be made in a record of birth, a will, or a public document [10]. The Court ruled that the parish marriage book entry and private letters were mere private writings and not recognized evidence of acknowledgment [11, 12]. Additionally, the mention of Gertrudes in the will of Gil's sister was insufficient because Article 129 requires acknowledgment to be made by the parents themselves, either jointly or separately [12, 13].

The order of the lower court is affirmed [14].
