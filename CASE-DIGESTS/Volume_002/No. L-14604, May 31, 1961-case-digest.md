I. CAPTION
PEDRO TABOADA v. THE MUNICIPALITY OF BADIAN, ALFONSO D. SUERTE & JULIO LLENOS, G.R. No. L-14604, May 31, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pedro Taboada, a non-civil service eligible, was appointed as a "temporary municipal policeman" of Badian, Cebu on January 24, 1950 [1]. He subsequently received two new appointments on December 13, 1954, and July 1, 1955, which were designated as "promotions" in salary but did not explicitly contain the word "temporary" [2]. On January 7, 1956, respondent Mayor Alfonso Suerte advised Taboada to resign due to his lack of civil service eligibility and subsequently terminated his services effective January 31, 1956 [3]. Taboada filed a petition for Mandamus, claiming his dismissal was unjustified because his later appointments made him a permanent employee [4, 5]. The Court of First Instance of Cebu ruled in his favor, ordering reinstatement and payment of back salaries [6]. The respondents appealed, arguing that Taboada’s status remained temporary [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a non-eligible employee originally appointed as temporary acquires permanent status when subsequent promotional appointments omit the designation "temporary."

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, ruling that the petitioner remained a temporary employee. Under Sec. 682 of the Revised Administrative Code, temporary appointments of non-eligibles generally cannot exceed three months [7]. The mere absence of the word "temporary" in subsequent promotional appointments does not convert a temporary status into a permanent one [8]. The Court held that the extension of a temporary appointment is merely an act of grace by the appointing officer and does not imply a change of status (*Jimenez v. Francisco*, G.R. No. L-9699, Feb. 28, 1957) [8]. Furthermore, one holding a temporary appointment has no fixed tenure and may be terminated at the pleasure of the appointing power without need to show cause (*U.P. v. CIR*, L-15416, April 28, 1960; *Mortero v. Castellanes*, L-12694, June 30, 1960) [9, 10].

The decision appealed from is reversed and the case is dismissed [11].
