I. CAPTION
In the Matter of the Petition of Roberto Ong to be Admitted a Citizen of the Philippines. Roberto Ong v. Republic of the Philippines, G.R. No. L-15764, May 19, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Roberto Ong filed a petition for naturalization on March 1, 1958, initially stating he was a high school student. He later amended the petition on April 22, 1958, claiming he was a salesman in a family-owned rice and furniture store earning ₱130.00 per month and that he owned a residential house worth ₱6,000.00. To prove his income, he submitted an unsworn statement from his sister. The Court of First Instance of La Union ruled in his favor, finding him qualified for citizenship [1-3]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that Ong failed to prove he owned property worth ₱6,000.00 and lacked a lucrative trade or profession [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner possesses a lucrative trade or profession.
2. W/N the petitioner proved ownership of real property worth ₱6,000.00.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that an applicant earning less than ₱250.00 a month is not considered as possessing the necessary lucrative trade or profession in view of the high cost of living. The Court cited *Din Tan v. Republic* and *Republic v. Lim* to support this threshold. Furthermore, Ong's claim of employment was deemed "flimsy and unbelievable" as it was contradicted by his status as a student in Manila and supported only by hearsay evidence (his sister's unsworn statement) [3, 4].

2. **NO.** The Court found no credible evidence to support Ong's claim of owning real property. He relied solely on his own testimony regarding a house where he and his parents lived. The Court ruled that if he were the true owner, he should have presented tax declarations or receipts in his name [5, 6].

Consequently, Ong failed to meet the requirements of Section 2, par. 4 of the Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473). The judgment was **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization was **DISMISSED** [7].
