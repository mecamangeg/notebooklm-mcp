I. CAPTION
MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and ASSOCIATED WATERFRONT SUPERVISORS UNION (PIWO), G.R. No. L-16994, June 30, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On December 10, 1958, the Associated Waterfront Supervisors Union (PIWO) filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against petitioners Manila Port Service and Manila Railroad Company. The Union sought overtime compensation for work rendered by its members on Saturdays from June 22 to September 30, 1957, relying on Republic Act No. 1880 and Commonwealth Act No. 444 [1]. Under R.A. 1880 and Executive Order No. 251, government office hours were prescribed as 8 hours a day from Monday to Friday, totaling 40 hours a week [2, 3]. However, the parties had a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) dated July 17, 1957, which fixed working hours at 7 hours from Monday to Friday and 5 hours on Saturdays [4].

The Union argued that since the law established a Monday-to-Friday work schedule, Saturday work should be paid as overtime [5]. The Manila Railroad Company had passed a resolution granting overtime for Saturday work effective October 1, 1957, but the Union wanted it retroactive to July 1957 [5]. The CIR ruled in favor of the Union, ordering the petitioners to pay overtime for the Saturday work [6]. The petitioners appealed, questioning the CIR's jurisdiction and the validity of the overtime claim [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over the claim.
2. W/N the employees are entitled to overtime compensation for work performed on Saturdays under R.A. 1880.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of Industrial Relations has exclusive jurisdiction. The Court held that whenever a claim for overtime compensation is made and an employer-employee relationship exists (or reinstatement is sought), the case falls within the CIR's jurisdiction [8]. Furthermore, the existence of a labor dispute likely to cause a strike places the matter under the CIR's cognizance [8].

2. **NO.** R.A. 1880 prescribes a **minimum** of 40 work hours per week; it does not declare Saturday a non-working day unless the employee has already completed the 40-hour requirement during the preceding five days [5, 9]. Under the CBA, the Union members worked only 7 hours from Monday to Friday, totaling 35 hours—five hours short of the minimum [9]. Consequently, the 5 hours rendered on Saturdays were necessary to complete the 40-hour legal requirement and cannot be considered overtime [9]. Although the Union claimed members actually worked 8 hours on weekdays, the Court noted that the 8th hour was already paid as overtime and cannot be counted twice to satisfy the basic 40-hour weekly requirement [10].

The order of the CIR is **REVERSED**, and the claim for differential overtime pay is **DISMISSED** [11].
