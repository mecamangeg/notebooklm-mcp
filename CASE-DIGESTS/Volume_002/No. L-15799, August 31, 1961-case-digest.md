I. CAPTION
ANGEL VILLARICA and NIEVES PALMA GIL VILLARICA v. CONCEPCION PALMA GIL, et al., G.R. Nos. L-15799 and L-15801, August 31, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In Civil Case No. 1160, the CFI of Davao rendered a judgment based on a compromise agreement ordering Nieves Palma Gil Villarica to convey 256.20 square meters of Lot No. 59-C to Concepcion Palma Gil. Lot No. 59-C had a total area of over 800 square meters. The decision affirmed by the Court of Appeals did not specify which particular portion of the lot was to be conveyed. When Nieves refused to execute the deed, the court authorized the Provincial Sheriff to do so. The Sheriff unilaterally surveyed and subdivided the lot, then executed a deed conveying specific subdivided lots (Lots 59-C-1 and 59-C-2) to Concepcion.

Concepcion subsequently filed an unlawful detainer case (Civil Case 2246) against the Villaricas based on this conveyance and obtained a favorable judgment. The Villaricas filed two actions: (1) a motion in the original Civil Case No. 1160 questioning the Sheriff's authority to subdivide the land (subject of G.R. No. L-15799); and (2) a separate civil action (Civil Case 2151) to annul the unlawful detainer judgment and the Sheriff's deeds (subject of G.R. No. L-15801). The lower court denied the motion in the first case and dismissed the complaint in the second.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Sheriff has the authority to determine and convey a specific portion of a larger lot when the judgment fails to designate it.
2. W/N a separate action for annulment is the proper remedy against an adverse unlawful detainer judgment.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Sheriff has no authority to determine the specific portion to be conveyed. Since the decision and the writ of execution did not state what specific portion of Lot No. 59-C was to be conveyed to Concepcion, the Sheriff had no authority to select such portion, survey it, or subdivide the lot. The determination of the specific area involves the exercise of judicial discretion or requires the agreement of the parties, not merely a ministerial act by the Sheriff. Consequently, the Sheriff's acts of subdivision and conveyance were unauthorized.

2. **NO.** The remedy against the decision in the unlawful detainer case is appeal, not annulment. The Municipal Court had jurisdiction over the unlawful detainer case, and its decision was valid and binding. Any errors committed therein should have been corrected by appealing that decision, rather than filing a separate action for its annulment.

Accordingly, the decision in G.R. No. L-15801 (dismissing the annulment case) is **AFFIRMED**, and the order in G.R. No. L-15799 (upholding the Sheriff's acts) is **REVERSED** and remanded for further proceedings.
