I. CAPTION
ROMAN LICUP v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-16196, May 30, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On October 20, 1956, Roman Licup filed Civil Case No. 31161 in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against the Manila Railroad Company and the GSIS, seeking a writ of mandamus to compel his retirement under Republic Act No. 660 [1]. He alleged he was separated from service in 1951 pursuant to the Reorganization Act of 1950 (R.A. No. 422) [2]. On January 7, 1957, the trial court dismissed the case, ruling that Licup’s own Annex "B" showed his separation was not due to reorganization under R.A. No. 422, hence he was not entitled to the retirement benefits claimed [3]. The court dismissed the case "for lack of merits" [3]. Licup did not appeal this order [4].

Two years later, on August 14, 1959, Licup filed Civil Case No. 41210 against the same defendants, alleging substantially the same facts and seeking the same relief [4]. The defendants moved to dismiss based on *res judicata*. The trial court dismissed the second complaint [4]. Licup appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the dismissal of the first case was not a judgment on the merits and thus could not constitute *res judicata* [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the first case (Civil Case No. 31161) constitutes *res judicata* barring the second action.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the dismissal of the first case bars the second action under the principle of *res judicata* because there is an identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action [5].

Under Section 4, Rule 30 of the Rules of Court, "unless otherwise ordered by the court, any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, operates as an adjudication upon the merits" [6]. The dismissal of the first case was not based on lack of jurisdiction or technical defects (such as improper venue or want of capacity to sue), but on a determination that Licup had no right to the relief sought based on the facts alleged and the annexes presented [7, 8]. The trial court’s order definitively ruled that Licup was not separated due to reorganization and thus had no right to retire under R.A. No. 660, dismissing the case "for lack of merits" [8, 9]. This adjudication became final and conclusive upon Licup's failure to appeal, precluding a subsequent action on the same cause [9].

The order appealed from is affirmed [10].
