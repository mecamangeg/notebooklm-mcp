I. CAPTION
ESTANISLAWA CANLAS v. CHAN LIN PO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16929, July 31, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Juanito Chan was charged with homicide through reckless imprudence for the death of Nicolas Paras. During the criminal trial, the private prosecutor reserved the right to file a separate civil action. Juanito was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment and to indemnify the heirs of Paras in the amount of P5,000.00.

Pursuant to the reservation, Estanislawa Canlas (Paras' widow) filed a separate civil action against Chan Lin Po and Remedios Diala (alleged parents of Juanito) and Lim Koo (alleged employer/owner of the vehicle). The complaint sought to enforce their primary liability under the Civil Code or subsidiary liability under the Revised Penal Code. The trial court dismissed the civil action, ruling that the indemnity awarded in the criminal case constituted *res judicata*, barring the civil suit. The trial court also noted that no evidence was presented to prove the relationship between Juanito and the defendants (employment or minority).

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the adjudication of indemnity in the criminal case constitutes *res judicata* barring a separate civil action against persons primarily or subsidiarily liable who were not parties to the criminal case.
2. W/N the defendants are liable for the damages caused by Juanito Chan.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The judgment in the criminal case, except as to the fact of the commission of the act, cannot be considered *res judicata* constituting a bar to the separate civil action, whether to enforce subsidiary or primary liability of defendants who were not parties to the criminal case. The two cases are different in nature and purpose, and affect different parties. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's ruling insofar as it held the action was barred by the criminal indemnity.

2. **NO.** The dismissal of the action was proper on the merits due to lack of evidence.
   *   **As to Lim Koo (Alleged Employer):** There was no proof that Juanito was an employee of Lim Koo at the time of the mishap, or that Lim Koo was engaged in business or industry (for subsidiary liability under Art. 103, Revised Penal Code). Nor was there proof that Juanito acted within the scope of assigned tasks (for primary liability under Art. 2180, New Civil Code).
   *   **As to Chan Lin Po and Remedios Diala (Parents):** They cannot be held liable under Art. 2180, par. 2 of the New Civil Code because there was no proof that Juanito was a minor living in their company. In fact, the Court of Appeals decision offered in evidence stated he was a married man.

Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** regarding the doctrine of *res judicata*.
