I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. OTIAK OMAL and LUZON SURETY COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-14457, June 30, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In 1954, Otiak Omal was charged with robbery in band. Luzon Surety Company, Inc. posted a bail bond of P10,000 for his provisional liberty, and Omal was released. On August 10, 1956, Omal was arrested anew on a separate charge of rape and was subsequently placed under the custody of the Provincial Governor. On December 12, 1956, while in such custody, Omal disappeared and escaped.

It was only on December 20, 1957—a year after the escape—that Luzon Surety filed an *ex parte* motion to withdraw the bail bond, claiming it could not locate the accused and that the escape was due to the negligence of the Provincial Warden and Governor. The State opposed the motion, arguing that the surety failed to ask for the cancellation of the bond when Omal was rearrested and thus remained liable. The Court of First Instance of Cotabato granted the motion and cancelled the bond. The State appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the surety is discharged from liability when the accused is rearrested on another charge and subsequently escapes, where the surety failed to inform the court of the rearrest.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's order. The Court held that upon posting bail, the surety becomes the "jailer" of the accused and assumes the obligation to keep him under surveillance at all times. This duty continues until the bond is cancelled or the surety is discharged.

While the performance of the bond may be rendered impossible by an "act of law" (such as the rearrest of the accused), it remains the duty of the surety to inform the court of this event so that appropriate action may be taken to discharge the surety, pursuant to Section 16, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court. In this case, Luzon Surety failed to inform the court of Omal's rearrest and only requested relief after he had already escaped. By keeping silent during the accused's detention, the surety is presumed to have chosen to continue with its liability. The subsequent arrest of the principal on another charge does not operate *ipso facto* as a discharge of the original bond.

Order reversed.
