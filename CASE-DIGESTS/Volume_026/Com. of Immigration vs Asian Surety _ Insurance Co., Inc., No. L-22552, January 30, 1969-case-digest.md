I. CAPTION
THE COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION v. ASIAN SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-22552, January 30, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Asian Surety & Insurance Co., Inc. executed a bond of P7,000 to guarantee that Cua Giok Ke, a non-immigrant Chinese student, would depart the Philippines on or before April 7, 1958, "or within such period as, in his discretion, the Commissioner of Immigration or his authorized representative may properly allow." The Bureau of Immigration granted several extensions of the student's stay without notifying Asian Surety. On June 13, 1961, the Commissioner declared the bond confiscated due to the student's failure to depart. Asian Surety surrendered the student three days later and sought to lift the confiscation, which was denied. The Commissioner filed an action to recover the bond amount. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling it inequitable to penalize the surety for extensions granted without its knowledge. The Commissioner appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Asian Surety is liable under the bond despite the extensions granted without its notice or consent.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court, holding that the bond constitutes the law between the parties. Asian Surety expressly undertook that the alien would depart on the specified date or within such period as the Commissioner "may properly allow" [1], [2]. By agreeing to these terms, the surety could not later claim exemption based on a lack of notice regarding extensions [3].

Furthermore, the Court ruled that the doctrine of *strictissimi juris* (strict construction in favor of the surety) does not apply to compensated sureties organized for profit. Citing *Pastoral v. Mutual Security Insurance Corp.* and *Pacific Tobacco Co. v. Lorenzana*, the Court explained that unlike accommodation sureties who act out of friendship, corporate sureties are insurers engaged in the indemnity business [4], [5]. They are not entitled to the same protection against "unjust pecuniary impoverishment" [6].

The decision is **REVERSED**, and Asian Surety & Insurance Co., Inc. is held liable under the bond [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Dizon, J.** (Concurring): Clarified that Article 2079 of the Civil Code, which extinguishes a guaranty if an extension is granted without the guarantor's consent, does not apply. The specific phrase in the bond granting discretion to the Commissioner to allow other periods amounted to the Surety's prior consent to all extensions [8], [9].
