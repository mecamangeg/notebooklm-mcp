I. CAPTION
Republic of the Philippines v. Sylvia de Kalintas, et al. (Ricardo Dequito, et al., Petitioners-Appellants v. Heirs of Salvador Lopez, Oppositors-Appellees), G.R. No. L-25141, January 31, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Ricardo Dequito and 33 others (Appellants) filed a motion in the Court of First Instance of Davao to set aside a February 28, 1959 decision rendered by the Justice of the Peace of Mati, acting as a Cadastral Court. This 1959 decision awarded Lot No. 1285 to the Municipality of Mati for use as a school site, subject to reversion to the Heirs of Salvador Lopez (Appellees). Appellants, claiming to be adverse possessors, argued the decision was void for lack of jurisdiction as the lot was controverted and valued over P5,000.

Pending this motion, Appellants learned that the Land Registration Commission had already issued a decree of registration for the lot on October 14, 1963. Consequently, Appellants moved to withdraw their motion to set aside the judgment and instead filed a petition for review of the decree, alleging that the Heirs of Lopez procured the decision through fraud and connivance with the judge. The CFI allowed the withdrawal of the original motion but dismissed the petition for review, ruling that it impermissibly changed the theory of the case and should have been filed as a separate action since the original motion was withdrawn.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for review was properly dismissed for changing the theory or cause of action of the original motion.
2. W/N the petition for review must be filed as a separate action rather than in the original cadastral proceeding.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the dismissal was erroneous. First, a petition for review is not a mere amendment to a motion to set aside a judgment because they have distinct objectives; the review attacks the decree, which has a "virtuality all its own" and serves as the basis for the certificate of title [1]. Second, even if viewed as an amendment, the theory of action remained unaltered: the nullification of the cadastral proceedings and award [2]. The Court ruled that adding allegations of fraud in the petition for review was not incompatible with the original grounds of lack of jurisdiction [2].

2. **NO.** Citing Section 112 of the Land Registration Act, the Court ruled that all petitions and motions after original registration "shall be filed and entitled in the original case in which the decree of registration was entered" [3]. The purpose of this rule is to avoid confusion and difficulty in tracing the origin of entries in the registry [3].

The Order of the Court of First Instance is set aside, and the records are remanded for further proceedings.
