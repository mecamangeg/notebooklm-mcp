I. CAPTION
MARCIAL T. CAEDO, et al. v. YU KHE THAI and RAFAEL BERNARDO, G.R. No. L-20392, December 18, 1968, 26 SCRA 410, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On March 24, 1958, at 5:30 A.M., plaintiff Marcial Caedo was driving his Mercury car on Highway 54 (now EDSA) with his family. Coming from the opposite direction was a Cadillac owned by defendant Yu Khe Thai and driven by defendant Rafael Bernardo. Yu Khe Thai was present in the vehicle. A *carretela* was traveling ahead of the Cadillac. Bernardo, speeding and failing to notice the *carretela* until he was only eight meters away, swerved to the left to overtake it. In doing so, he hit the *carretela's* wheel, skidded obliquely into the opposite lane, and collided with Caedo's oncoming car [1-3].

The Court of First Instance of Rizal found Bernardo negligent and held Yu Khe Thai solidarily liable with him for damages [4, 5]. The case was certified to the Supreme Court by the Court of Appeals [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the owner Yu Khe Thai is solidarily liable with his driver for the negligence that caused the accident under Article 2184 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the imputation of solidary liability to Yu Khe Thai was an error [7]. Under **Article 2184 of the Civil Code**, an owner present in the vehicle is solidarily liable only if he could have, by the use of due diligence, prevented the misfortune [8]. The Court held that the basis of this liability is the relationship of *paterfamilias*, not *respondeat superior* [9]. The test of imputed negligence is subjective; owners are not held to the same "uniform and inflexible standard of diligence as are professional drivers" [10].

Relying on the doctrine in *Chapman v. Underwood*, the Court explained that for the owner to be liable, the driver's negligent acts must be continued for such a length of time that the owner has a reasonable opportunity to observe them and direct the driver to desist [11]. In this case, Bernardo had a clean driving record for over 20 years [9]. The negligence—a sudden risky decision to overtake rather than slow down—occurred too quickly for Yu Khe Thai to effectively intervene [3, 12]. The owner's failure to prevent the sudden maneuver did not constitute negligence on his part.

The judgment is **MODIFIED**, declaring Yu Khe Thai free from liability, and **AFFIRMED** regarding the sole liability of Rafael Bernardo [13].
