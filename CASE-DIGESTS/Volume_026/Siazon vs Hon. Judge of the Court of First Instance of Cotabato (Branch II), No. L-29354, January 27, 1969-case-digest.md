I. CAPTION
ACTING PROVINCIAL FISCAL OF COTABATO ALEJANDRO C. SIAZON v. THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF COTABATO, BRANCH II, et al., G.R. No. L-29354, January 27, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alejandro C. Siazon was designated by the Secretary of Justice as Acting Provincial Fiscal of Cotabato specifically to investigate and prosecute the "Anchinges" murder case against respondents Adan de las Marias, et al., pursuant to Section 1679 of the Revised Administrative Code [1-3]. Despite this designation, the accused filed motions for bail and hospitalization serving copies only to the *regular* Provincial Fiscal, not the Petitioner [4, 5]. The lower courts granted these motions without Petitioner's knowledge [4, 6]. Petitioner challenged these orders via certiorari (Civil Case No. 848), but the respondent Judge dismissed said petition on September 10, 1968, ruling that Petitioner lacked legal capacity and that his designation did not divest the regular fiscal of authority [7]. However, records showed that a new judge had already qualified to preside over the same court branch on August 27, 1968, terminating the respondent Judge's temporary assignment [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the designation of an Acting Provincial Fiscal under Sec. 1679 confers exclusive authority to prosecute a specific case, rendering service of pleadings to the regular fiscal insufficient.
2. W/N the respondent Judge had the authority to issue the order dismissing Civil Case No. 848 on September 10, 1968.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 1679 of the Revised Administrative Code contemplates not a joint responsibility, but a complete takeover by the designated fiscal of "all the duties" ordinarily discharged by the regular fiscal which the latter is unable to perform [9, 10]. The prosecution is under the sole supervision of the designee. Consequently, the Petitioner, as the proper government counsel, should have been served with copies of pleadings and orders. Pleadings without proof of service to the proper counsel are "scraps of paper," and court orders issued upon them are null and void [8].

2. **NO.** For a judgment or order terminating a case on the merits to be valid, it must be promulgated during the judge's incumbency [8]. Since a new judge had qualified to preside over Branch II as of August 27, 1968, the temporary assignment of the respondent Judge was effectively terminated. Therefore, the dismissal order issued by the respondent Judge on September 10, 1968, was issued without due authority and is void [11].

Petition granted; orders declared null and void; writ of preliminary injunction made permanent [12].
