I. CAPTION
ERNESTO ESCALER, ET AL. v. HON. TOMAS P. PANGANIBAN AND SEVERO LISING, G.R. No. L-23457, December 16, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondent Severo Lising filed a petition (later amended) in the Court of Agrarian Relations against petitioners Escaler et al. to redeem a landholding or annul a deed of sale [1-3]. Petitioners filed a motion to dismiss alleging failure to state a cause of action and a supplemental motion alleging lack of jurisdiction over the second cause of action [3]. On July 11, 1964, respondent Judge Panganiban issued an order deferring the resolution of the motions to dismiss until the trial on the merits, stating that the grounds pleaded, especially regarding jurisdiction, did not appear to be "indubitable" [4]. Claiming the Judge acted without or in excess of jurisdiction by deferring the resolution and requiring them to answer, petitioners filed a petition for prohibition with the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge acted without or in excess of jurisdiction by deferring the resolution of the motion to dismiss until the trial on the merits.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the respondent Judge did not act without or in excess of jurisdiction. The Rules of Court (specifically Section 3, Rule 16) plainly authorize a trial judge to defer action on a motion to dismiss submitted for resolution if, in his opinion, the ground relied upon is not indubitable [5, 6]. The Court noted that the order neither granted nor denied the motion; at most, the Judge might have committed an error of judgment in believing the grounds were not indubitable, but this does not constitute an excess of jurisdiction [5]. Furthermore, the orderly procedure for judicial cases should be followed absent a clear showing of unnecessary and substantial prejudice to the litigants [6].

The writ prayed for is denied and the writ of preliminary injunction issued heretofore is dissolved [7].
