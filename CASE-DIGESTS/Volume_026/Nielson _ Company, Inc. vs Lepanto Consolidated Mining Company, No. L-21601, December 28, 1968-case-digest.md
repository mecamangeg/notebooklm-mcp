I. CAPTION
NIELSON & COMPANY, INC. v. LEPANTO CONSOLIDATED MINING COMPANY, G.R. No. L-21601, December 28, 1968, 26 SCRA 540, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Nielson & Company, Inc. (Nielson) and Lepanto Consolidated Mining Company (Lepanto) executed a management contract in 1937 whereby Nielson would operate and develop Lepanto's mines for five years, renewable for another five. Nielson was to receive a monthly fee plus 10% of the net profits (later modified to 10% of dividends declared, depletion reserves, and capital account expenses). In 1942, operations ceased due to World War II and the destruction of the mines. After liberation in 1945, Lepanto took control and prevented Nielson from resuming management, claiming the contract was terminated.

Nielson sued for damages and specific performance. The Supreme Court initially ruled in favor of Nielson in 1966. Lepanto filed a Motion for Reconsideration, raising a new theory that the management contract was one of agency, which is revocable at will, and thus properly terminated in 1945. Lepanto also argued that the suspension of the contract due to war ended upon liberation in 1945, not upon the actual resumption of operations in 1948. Finally, Lepanto questioned the validity of awarding shares of stock (stock dividends) to Nielson, a non-stockholder, as compensation.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the management contract is a contract of agency revocable at the will of Lepanto.
2. W/N the contract period was suspended and extended until the rehabilitation of the mines was completed in 1948.
3. W/N Nielson is entitled to receive shares of stock (stock dividends) as compensation for services rendered.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The contract is a lease of services (Article 1544, Old Civil Code), not a contract of agency (Article 1709, Old Civil Code). The distinction lies in representation: an agent executes juridical acts (creation, modification, or extinction of relations with third parties) on behalf of the principal, while a lessor of services performs material acts for an employer. Under the contract, Nielson's principal undertaking was to operate the mine and mill—material acts—subject to Lepanto's control. While Nielson could act as a purchasing agent, it required Lepanto's prior approval, making it merely an intermediary. Since it is a lease of services, it could not be unilaterally revoked by Lepanto at will.

2. **YES.** The contract expressly provided that in cases of *force majeure* like war which "adversely affects the work of mining and milling," the agreement would be suspended. The Court held that the suspension lasted not just during the war, but until the adverse effects (destruction of the mine) were remedied. The period of suspension is reckoned from February 1942 until the resumption of operations on June 26, 1948. To avoid injustice to Nielson, who invested spade-work and capital, the contract period is extended for a time equal to the suspension.

3. **NO.** Under Section 16 of the Corporation Law, stock dividends may only be issued to stockholders in lieu of undistributed profits. Issuing stock dividends to Nielson, a non-stockholder, for services rendered is invalid as it would alter the proportional interest of existing stockholders. **However**, the Court ruled that the contractual intention was to use the cash value of the stock dividends as a basis for computation. Therefore, Lepanto must pay Nielson the *cash equivalent* of the stock dividends (P300,000.00), not the shares themselves.

The Court **reversed** the trial court decision and **modified** its previous ruling, ordering Lepanto to pay Nielson specific cash amounts including the P300,000.00 equivalent of stock dividends, with interest and attorney's fees.
