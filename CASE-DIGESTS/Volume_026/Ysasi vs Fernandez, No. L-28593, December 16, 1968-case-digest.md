I. CAPTION
JUAN YSASI v. HON. JOSE F. FERNANDEZ, MARIA ALDECOA DE YSASI, and JON YSASI, G.R. No. L-28593, December 16, 1968, 26 SCRA 393, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On June 25, 1968, the Supreme Court rendered a judgment upholding petitioner Juan Ysasi's right to administer conjugal properties and directing respondent Judge Fernandez to issue a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction ordering private respondents Maria Aldecoa de Ysasi and Jon Ysasi to turn over possession of Hacienda Manucao-A to petitioner upon the filing of a P50,000 bond. On August 5, 1968, Judge Fernandez approved the bond and issued the injunctive writ. However, private respondents refused to comply. Instead, they moved to dissolve the injunction under Rule 58, Section 6, alleging that its continuance would cause them great damage while petitioner could be compensated. On August 10, 1968, Judge Fernandez dissolved the very injunction he was ordered to issue, accepting a counterbond of P60,000 from respondents. Petitioner filed urgent motions with the Supreme Court to annul the dissolution order and cite respondents in contempt. Despite a subsequent restraining order from the Supreme Court against the dissolution, private respondents persisted in their refusal to surrender the properties.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court may dissolve a preliminary mandatory injunction issued pursuant to a specific directive of the Supreme Court.
2. W/N private respondents are liable for contempt for refusing to comply with the injunctive order.
3. W/N respondent Judge acts in contempt or disrespect of the Supreme Court by dissolving the injunction.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that so long as the same facts upon which the Supreme Court issued the mandate exist, the Court of First Instance may not invoke Section 6 of Rule 58 to dissolve the writ. The lower court cannot dissolve the writ upon a mere counterbond because if every lower court could overrule decisions of the Supreme Court, litigation would never end and judicial chaos would result (Shioji v. Harvey). The dissolution destroyed the effectiveness of the Supreme Court’s directive. The husband’s power of administration is statutory (Art. 165, Civil Code) and cannot be removed by the mere filing of a counterbond without proof of abuse of administration.

2. **YES.** Private respondents were declared in contempt. Their refusal to turn over the hacienda was unjustified. Maria Aldecoa’s claim that she could not comply due to her son’s absence was a pretext, as she had custody of the properties. Jon Ysasi was also aware of the order. Their "contumacious disobedience" and adamant refusal to honor the injunctive order, even after the Supreme Court issued a restraining order against the lower court's dissolution, constituted disrespect to the Court.

3. **YES.** (Warned). While not formally punished with a fine or imprisonment in the disposition, the Judge was sternly warned. The Court ruled that the official character of a judge does not insulate him from punishment for insubordination of an order from the highest Tribunal (Commissioner of Immigration v. Cloribel). By dissolving the injunction, the Judge effectively reversed the Supreme Court’s decision, implying he could correct a "mistake" of the appellate court.

The Order of August 10, 1968 was **SET ASIDE**; private respondents were **DECLARED IN CONTEMPT** and fined P1,000 each; and respondent Judge was **WARNED**.
