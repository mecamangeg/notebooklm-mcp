I. CAPTION
VIRGINIA L. DE CASTRO v. HON. PIO MARCOS, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Baguio City, and RUFITO AKIA, G.R. No. L-26093, January 27, 1969, 26 SCRA 644, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Rufito Akia filed a petition under Republic Act No. 931 to reopen cadastral proceedings (Civil Reservation Case No. 1) regarding a parcel of land in Baguio City. Petitioner Virginia L. De Castro moved to intervene, claiming 1,000 square meters of the subject land. De Castro was an awardee of a Township Sales Application who had won the public bidding and paid the purchase price in full.

Respondent Judge Marcos initially granted the intervention but later dismissed De Castro's opposition upon Akia’s motion. The Judge ruled that De Castro, as a mere applicant, lacked the personality to sue independently of the Bureau of Lands. The Judge also relied on a manifestation that De Castro’s award had been cancelled for failure to introduce improvements. De Castro moved for reconsideration, citing that the cancellation was pending reconsideration by the Director of Lands (who eventually reinstated the award) and that improvements were impossible due to lack of facilities. The Judge denied her motions. De Castro filed a petition for certiorari, arguing grave abuse of discretion and that the reopening proceedings were jurisdictionally defective for lack of publication.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for reopening of cadastral proceedings under R.A. 931 requires publication for the court to acquire jurisdiction.
2. W/N a sales awardee of public land has the legal standing to oppose a petition for reopening of cadastral proceedings.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the procedure for reopening under Section 1 of R.A. 931 does not include publication; it merely requires notice to the Solicitor General. The cadastral court had already acquired jurisdiction over the land in the original cadastral case instituted by the Director of Lands. The doctrine in *Director of Lands v. Benitez*, which required publication, applies only when *additional* territory not included in the original survey is sought to be included. Since the land in question was already embraced in the original proceedings, new publication is not jurisdictionally fatal.

2. **YES.** Petitioner De Castro has legal standing. R.A. 931 expressly bars reopening with respect to parcels of land that have been "alienated, reserved, leased, granted, or otherwise provisionally or permanently disposed of by the Government." Although De Castro’s award was not yet a permanent disposition (title), it was at least a provisional one sufficient to bar reopening. The Court cited *Heirs of Pelagio Zara v. Director of Lands*, ruling that persons claiming possession who have applied for purchase of public land have the personality to oppose registration. As an awardee who paid the full price, De Castro is considered an equitable owner with the right to protect her interest. The dismissal of her opposition constituted grave abuse of discretion.

The petition is GRANTED, the assailed orders are annulled, and the respondent Judge is directed to reinstate petitioner's opposition.
