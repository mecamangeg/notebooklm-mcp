I. CAPTION
UNITED RESTAUROR'S EMPLOYEES & LABOR UNION-PAFLU v. HON. GUILLERMO E. TORRES and DELTA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-24993, December 18, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Delta Development Corporation (Delta), owner of the Makati commercial center, filed a complaint for injunction against petitioner United Restauror's Employees & Labor Union (Union), an association of employees of Suló Restaurant, a lessee of Delta. Delta sought to stop the Union from picketing on its private property, arguing there was no employer-employee relationship between them. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, presided by Judge Torres, issued a writ of preliminary injunction against the picketing [1], [2].

The Union filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court to annul the writ, claiming the CFI lacked jurisdiction as the case involved unfair labor practices falling under the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [3]. However, during the pendency of the case, a consent election was held on October 4, 1965, where the Union was defeated by a rival union, Suló Employees Labor Union (SELU). SELU was subsequently certified as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of Suló's employees [4], [5]. Delta moved to dismiss the petition as moot [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition to annul the injunction against picketing has become moot and academic due to the Union's defeat in the certification election.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition for being moot and academic.

The Court held that the Union's right to strike and picket ceased upon its defeat in the consent election [6]. Under Section 12(a) of Republic Act No. 875, the right to be the exclusive representative for collective bargaining is vested in the labor union designated by the majority of the employees [7]. Since SELU was certified as the majority union, it acquired the exclusive right and obligation to represent the employees [7].

A minority union cannot demand collective bargaining, and a strike or picket by a minority union to compel an employer to bargain with it is unlawful after the proper bargaining representative has been certified [8]. Consequently, the Union may not continue to picket, and the object of the case was lost. The petition was dismissed, and the writ of preliminary injunction was dissolved for being *functus officio* [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
