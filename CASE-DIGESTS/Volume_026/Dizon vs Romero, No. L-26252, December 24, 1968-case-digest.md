I. CAPTION
CONRADO DIZON, ET AL. v. HON. HONORIO ROMERO and PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, G.R. No. L-26252, December 24, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Paula Sanchez Vda. de Dizon executed a general power of attorney in favor of her son, Jesus Dizon, in 1949. Using this, Jesus obtained crop loans from respondent Philippine National Bank (PNB) secured by mortgages on Paula's land. Paula died in 1960, survived by Jesus and the petitioners (her other children).

In 1964, PNB initiated intestate proceedings and recommended the appointment of a Deputy Clerk of Court as administratrix. PNB then filed a foreclosure suit against Jesus and the administratrix. The administratrix failed to answer the complaint. When petitioners urged her to defend the estate, she replied she would "consult the Bank" first. Petitioners filed a motion to intervene to protect their inheritance, attaching their answer with defenses including prescription and the invalidity of the mortgage (arguing a special power of attorney was required). Judge Romero denied the motion. The Court of Appeals dismissed petitioners' subsequent mandamus petition, ruling that intervention is discretionary and not reviewable by mandamus.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial judge committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the motion to intervene, making mandamus the proper remedy.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision. While the allowance of a motion to intervene rests in the sound discretion of the court, such discretion is not unlimited. A denial may constitute an arbitrary or capricious exercise of discretion correctible by mandamus if an ordinary appeal is not an adequate remedy [1-3].

The Court found grave abuse of discretion because: (1) The administratrix was apparently in collusion with the plaintiff Bank, evidenced by her refusal to answer and her "consultation" with the Bank [4]; (2) The motion was filed *before* the default order [5]; (3) The petitioners, as forced heirs, had a material interest transmitted immediately upon death (Art. 777, Civil Code) [6]; and (4) Their answer raised valid defenses, specifically that a general power of attorney is insufficient to create real rights like mortgages under Art. 1878 of the Civil Code [5]. An appeal would not be speedy or adequate as it would require a retrial.

Petition GRANTED. Judge Romero is directed to allow the intervention.
