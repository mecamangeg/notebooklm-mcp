I. CAPTION
ASSOCIATED INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC. v. ANTONIO BANZON and ROSA BALMACEDA, G.R. No. L-23971, November 29, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Associated Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. (Petitioner) obtained a final executory judgment for a sum of money against Antonio Banzon and Maximo Sta. Maria in Civil Case No. 31237 before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [1]. A writ of execution was issued, and two parcels of land in Rizal covered by TCT Nos. 39685 and 53759, registered in Banzon's name, were levied upon and sold to Petitioner as the highest bidder [2].

After the redemption period expired without redemption being made, Petitioner requested Banzon to surrender the owner's duplicate titles. Banzon refused [3]. Petitioner then filed a petition with the CFI of Rizal to compel the surrender of the titles for cancellation. Banzon opposed, arguing that: (1) the judgment in the Manila case was void because he was never served with summons; and (2) the properties levied upon were conjugal assets of him and his wife, Rosa Balmaceda, and thus the levy was void [4]. The CFI of Rizal ruled in favor of Petitioner, ordering the surrender of the titles [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court acquired jurisdiction over Banzon despite his claim of non-service of summons.
2. W/N the subject properties constitute conjugal property exempt from the levy.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the regularity of official actions and proceedings is presumed until the contrary is proved. The records of the original case showed that counsel appeared on behalf of "all the defendants," including Banzon [6]. The presumption that summons was duly served or that Banzon voluntarily appeared stands, as he failed to rebut it with competent evidence, such as the sheriff's return [6]. Furthermore, Banzon received notices of execution, levy, and sale but failed to file a third-party claim or injunction, which militates against his claim of lack of due process [7].

2. **NO.** The Transfer Certificates of Title were issued solely in the name of Antonio R. Banzon [8]. There was no evidence presented to show that the properties were acquired during his marriage to his present wife [8, 9]. Consequently, the contention that the property was conjugal cannot be sustained [10].

Decision affirmed [11].
