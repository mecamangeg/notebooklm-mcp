I. CAPTION
JOSE S. MATUTE v. THE COURT OF APPEALS (Third Division) and MATIAS S. MATUTE, G.R. No. L-26751; JOSE S. MATUTE v. HON. JUDGE VICENTE P. BULLECER and MARIANO NASSER, G.R. No. L-26085; JOSE S. MATUTE and LUIS S. MATUTE v. HON. VICENTE P. BULLECER, et al., G.R. No. L-26106, January 31, 1969, 26 SCRA 768, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
These are three consolidated petitions involving the Estate of Amadeo Matute Olave.
**L-26751:** Heirs sought the removal of co-administrator Matias Matute for incompetence. Matias filed a "Motion to Dismiss and/or Demurrer to Evidence," reserving the right to present evidence if denied. The Probate Court (Judge Nietes), without ruling on the motion or receiving Matias's evidence, removed him *motu proprio* based on court records and appointed Jose Matute as successor without a separate hearing. Matias filed certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA). Jose challenged the CA’s jurisdiction, arguing the estate's value exceeded P200,000.
**L-26085:** Armed with his appointment, Jose attempted to take over haciendas leased to Mariano Nasser. Nasser filed an injunction suit in Davao. Jose filed a Motion to Dismiss, which was denied. Due to mailing delays, Jose was declared in default and judgment was rendered against him before his counsel received the notice of the denial of his motion to dismiss.
**L-26106:** Matias (on behalf of the Estate) filed a complaint to annul a compromise judgment regarding attorney's fees (Atty. Canlas). Jose intervened. The trial court dismissed the complaint with prejudice on the ground of *res judicata*. It subsequently declared the intervenors in default on the defendants' counterclaim for damages and issued a writ of execution. Jose filed certiorari to annul these orders.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over a contest for administration where the estate value exceeds P200,000.
2. W/N the Probate Court’s removal of Matias and appointment of Jose were valid.
3. W/N the order of default in L-26085 was valid.
4. W/N certiorari lies to annul the dismissal order and default judgment in L-26106.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction. In a contest for the administration of an estate, the amount in controversy is the value of the whole estate, not the value of the specific assets being administered. Since the Matute estate was worth over P200,000, jurisdiction belonged to the Supreme Court. (Citing *Fernandez v. Maravilla*).
2. **NO.** The removal and appointment were void for lack of due process. **Removal:** Under Rule 35 (Demurrer to Evidence), a defendant has the right to present evidence if his motion is denied. The judge committed grave abuse of discretion by removing Matias based on *motu proprio* findings without affording him a "day in court" to present evidence. **Appointment:** The appointment of Jose was made without the requisite hearing and notification to all interested parties, which is essential for validity (Citing *Eusebio v. Valmores*).
3. **NO.** The order of default was a patent nullity. Under Rule 16, Section 4, the period to file an answer commences to run anew from the time the defendant *receives notice* of the denial of his motion to dismiss. Jose was declared in default on April 16, but his counsel only received notice of the denial on April 25. Thus, the period to answer had not even begun.
4. **As to Dismissal of Complaint: NO.** The dismissal was an adjudication on the merits based on *res judicata*. The proper remedy was appeal, not certiorari. Having failed to appeal within the reglementary period, the order became final. **As to Default on Counterclaim: YES.** The trial court acted in excess of jurisdiction. When the main complaint was dismissed on defendants' motion, the proceedings were terminated, and the counterclaim was deemed abandoned. Furthermore, the answer filed by Matias to the common cause of action in the counterclaim inured to the benefit of the intervenors.

**Disposition:**
**L-26751:** Petition GRANTED. Order of removal and appointment set aside.
**L-26085:** Petition GRANTED. Default order and judgment set aside.
**L-26106:** Petition DENIED as to the dismissal of the complaint; GRANTED as to the default judgment on the counterclaim.
