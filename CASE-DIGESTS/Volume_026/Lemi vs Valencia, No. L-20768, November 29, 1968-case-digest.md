I. CAPTION
ELISEO B. LEMI v. BRIGIDO VALENCIA, et al., G.R. No. L-20768, November 29, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lemi operated radio station DZQR under a license expiring on May 23, 1961 [1]. He filed renewal applications and paid the corresponding fees in April 1961 and May 1962, but the Radio Control Office (RCO) took no action on them [2]. Despite the lack of formal renewal, Lemi continued operating the station without interference and with the official tolerance of the RCO, which even requested him to play specific songs [2, 3].

On January 11, 1963, respondents (Public Works Secretary Valencia, RCO Chief San Andres, and agents), armed with a search warrant, seized Lemi’s radio transmitter [4]. They alleged the transmitter lacked a nameplate and differed from the authorized unit, and that Lemi had filed his renewal applications late [5, 6]. Lemi filed an original petition for mandamus with preliminary injunction before the Supreme Court, arguing the seizure was illegal and violated his right to a hearing [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the seizure of the transmitter and effective disapproval of the license renewal were valid despite the lack of a hearing.
2. W/N the petitioner’s failure to exhaust administrative remedies bars the petition for mandamus.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the seizure and refusal to renew were illegal. Under **Section 3(l) of the Radio Control Law (Act 3846)**, no application for renewal shall be disapproved without giving the licensee a **hearing** [9, 10]. The Court held that the respondents' seizure of the transmitter, though under a search warrant, was an attempt to evade this statutory requirement and violated due process [10]. Regarding the alleged late filing, the Court applied the ruling in *Bolinao Electronics Corp. v. Valencia*, noting that an RCO circular dated July 24, 1962, condoned previous late filings if corrected by August 10, 1962, which Lemi had done [11, 12]. Since the RCO had tolerated the station's operation, the violations had ceased to exist in legal effect [10].

2. **NO.** The principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply when the acts complained of are **patently illegal** and there is an urgency for judicial intervention [13]. The Court found no statute providing an appeal to the Secretary, and even if one existed under his general supervision powers, it was not an adequate remedy given the seizure completely immobilized the station, demanding immediate relief [13].

The writ of preliminary mandatory injunction previously issued is made permanent [14].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**J.B.L. Reyes, J. (Concurring):** Expressed "emphatic condemnation" of the RCO's practice of indefinitely delaying action on license applications. He viewed this official indolence as a "subtle attempt to impose absolute radio censorship" and silence critical views, which constitutes indirect subversion of constitutional liberties [15].
