I. CAPTION
**JOSE MA. LOCSIN, JESUSA LOCSIN, CONCEPCION LOCSIN, EMMA LOCSIN, ROSARIO LOCSIN and TERESITA LOCSIN v. HON. RAFAEL C. CLIMACO, in his capacity as District Judge of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, and HAWAIIAN-PHILIPPINE COMPANY, G.R. No. L-27319, January 31, 1969, Castro, J.**

II. FACTS
Petitioners Locsin are owners of Hacienda San Vicente in Negros Occidental. Respondent Hawaiian-Philippine Company (Central) operates a sugar mill and a railway system, a portion of which traverses the petitioners' hacienda. The Central's right of way was based on milling contracts executed in 1919 and a 1953 Memorandum Agreement, which expired in the 1963-1964 crop year. Paragraph 10 of the 1953 Agreement stipulated that upon expiration, the Central had two years to remove the tracks, otherwise they would become the property of the planters.

After the contract expired and negotiations for a renewal failed, the petitioners sought to enforce their property rights. Jose Ma. Locsin notified the Central that he would close the hacienda to the railway traffic. In response, the Central filed a third-party complaint and an urgent *ex parte* motion for preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental (presided by respondent Judge Climaco) to restrain the Locsins from obstructing the railway. The Central argued that even without a contract, it was entitled to the right of way under the Sugar Limitation Law (Act 4166) or as a legal easement. Judge Climaco issued the writ of preliminary injunction. The Locsins filed a motion to dissolve the writ, which was denied. They then filed this petition for certiorari, alleging grave abuse of discretion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a motion for reconsideration was a necessary condition precedent before filing the petition for certiorari.
2. W/N the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction granting the Central a right of way was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A motion for reconsideration is generally required, but it is not necessary when a definite question has been properly raised, argued, and submitted to the lower court, and the latter has decided the question. The petitioners' "motion to dissolve" the writ of injunction raised the same arguments regarding excess of jurisdiction and grave abuse of discretion. Since the lower court denied this motion and maintained the writ, a subsequent motion for reconsideration would have been a "patent superfluity."

2. **NO.** The injunction was issued with grave abuse of discretion because the Central's right to the easement was not clear and unquestioned. The Court held that the function of an injunction is to protect a present, existing right. Here, the contractual right of way had indisputably expired with the 1953 Agreement. Unlike the case of *Asturias Sugar Central v. Montinola*, there was no "indeclinable reassumption" or renewal of the contract relations between the parties.

Furthermore, the Central failed to establish the existence of a compulsory legal easement under the Civil Code. Under Articles 649 and 650, the owner of a dominant estate must prove four requisites: (1) the estate is surrounded by other immovables without adequate outlet; (2) payment of proper indemnity; (3) the isolation was not due to the proprietor's own acts; and (4) the right of way is at the point least prejudicial to the servient estate. The Central did not allege or prove these preconditions. Finally, the Court ruled that the Sugar Limitation Law (Act 4166) regulates quotas but does not confer rights of way on sugar centrals. Without a clear legal right or title, the issuance of the injunction was unwarranted.

**Petition granted; orders annulled and set aside.**
