I. CAPTION
AURELIO ARCILLAS v. HON. GREGORIO D. MONTEJO, MODESTA ALFARO, GERONIMO ARCILLAS and VICENTE ARCILLAS, G.R. No. L-21725, November 29, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Eustaquio Arcillas died intestate in 1958, leaving Lot No. 276. On November 12, 1962, respondent Geronimo Arcillas filed a "cadastral motion" under Section 112 of Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act) to cancel the title and issue a new one reflecting the heirs' shares, alleging that some heirs had sold their shares to respondent Vicente Arcillas [1, 2]. On November 16, 1962, petitioner Aurelio Arcillas and other heirs filed Special Proceeding No. 632 for letters of administration, stating the estate had no debts [2, 3]. Aurelio opposed the cadastral motion, citing the pending administration case [3]. Respondents opposed the administration petition, arguing it was unnecessary and expensive since the estate had no debts and Lot 276 was the only asset [4]. Aurelio insisted there were other properties and no unanimity for extrajudicial settlement [4]. The CFI of Zamboanga dismissed the administration petition and gave due course to the cadastral motion, ruling that under Rule 74, Section 1, administration was superfluous and would deplete estate funds [5]. Petitioner filed for certiorari [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the administration proceedings were properly dismissed under Rule 74, Section 1 because the estate had no debts.
2. W/N the "cadastral motion" under Section 112 of Act 496 was the proper remedy to settle the estate distribution.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that Rule 74, Section 1 is not mandatory. The provision states that heirs "may" divide the estate among themselves if there are no debts, which indicates discretion, not compulsion [7]. Citing *Rodriguez v. Tan*, the Court ruled that heirs are not precluded from instituting administration proceedings if they do not desire to resort to extrajudicial partition for good reasons [8]. Heirs cannot be rebuffed in this discretion merely because administration is more expensive; by choosing this path, they voluntarily assume the resultant delay and expenses [9]. Furthermore, the veracity of the claim regarding other properties is better ascertained in administration proceedings [9].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that relief under Section 112 of Act 496 for the alteration of a certificate of title can only be granted if there is unanimity among the parties or no adverse claim [10]. Here, petitioner's express objection demonstrated a lack of unanimity, rendering the case controversial. Such issues must be litigated in an ordinary case or the appropriate proceeding (the administration case), as the summary nature of land registration proceedings is inadequate for resolving such disputes [10].

The appealed orders were SET ASIDE, and the respondent Judge was directed to reinstate Special Proceedings No. 632 [11].
