I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION and LEONCIO B. MONZON v. MLQSEA FACULTY ASSOCIATION and DIONISIO Q. QUIMOSING, G.R. No. L-24019, November 29, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Dionisio Q. Quimosing, a professor at the Philippine Educational Institution and president of the respondent Union, was dismissed from his employment. After his election as union president and the subsequent filing of unfair labor practice (ULP) charges against the petitioners, Quimosing's teaching load was reduced and eventually eliminated for the 1960-1961 school year. Petitioners claimed the reduction was due to diminished enrollment and Quimosing's interest in teaching at another institute. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) rejected these defenses, finding the petitioners guilty of ULP for dismissing Quimosing due to his union activities, and ordered his reinstatement with back pay. Petitioners appealed, questioning the CIR's factual findings and arguing that reinstatement was impossible because the corporation was dissolved on March 12, 1964.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N faculty members of educational institutions are entitled to the protection of the Industrial Peace Act.
2. W/N the Supreme Court can review the factual findings of the CIR regarding the unfair labor practice.
3. W/N Quimosing is entitled to reinstatement and full back wages if the employer-corporation has been dissolved.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Faculty members of educational institutions may avail of the full protection of the Industrial Peace Act. Citing *Far Eastern University v. CIR* and *Feati University v. Bautista*, the Court affirmed the CIR's power to inquire into alleged unfair labor practices attributed to educational institutions [1], [2].

2. **NO.** Findings of fact by the CIR are conclusive upon the Supreme Court in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion. The Court found that the CIR's decision—that Quimosing was dismissed for union activities rather than the alleged diminished enrollment—was supported by evidence and thus must remain undisturbed [3], [4], [5].

3. **YES, subject to limitations.** While the finding of ULP is affirmed, the remedy is contingent on the corporation's status. If the Philippine Educational Institution was indeed dissolved on March 12, 1964, reinstatement is impossible, and Quimosing's right to back wages is limited to the period from his dismissal up to the date of dissolution. The Court remanded the case to the CIR to determine the fact of dissolution [6], [7], [8].

**Decision affirmed insofar as respondents are found guilty of ULP; case remanded to the CIR to determine the dissolution status and fix the scope of back wages [9].**
