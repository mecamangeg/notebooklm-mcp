I. CAPTION
DIONISIO PALTENG, et al. v. THE HONORABLE JUSTICES OF THE COURT OF APPEALS, FLORENTINA RESPICIO and ROSA MALLABO, G.R. Nos. L-25739 & L-25886, January 31, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners (defendants) lost two ejectment cases in the Justice of the Peace Court and subsequently in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Isabela. During the trial, they were represented by Atty. Pacifico Capuchino. Following the adverse decision of the CFI, petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA). The notice of appeal, appeal bond, and record on appeal were filed by a different lawyer, Atty. Teodulo E. Mirasol. However, there was no formal relief of Atty. Capuchino as counsel, nor was there a formal substitution of counsel by Atty. Mirasol.

The CA dismissed the appeal for failure to pay the required docket fees. The notice to pay said fees had been sent to Atty. Capuchino, the counsel of record in the lower court, and not to Atty. Mirasol. Petitioners moved for reconsideration, arguing that the dismissal was a grave abuse of discretion because the notice should have been served on Atty. Mirasol, who was handling the appeal. The CA denied the motion.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the service of notice to pay docket fees on the original counsel (Atty. Capuchino) instead of the new counsel (Atty. Mirasol) was valid to bind the petitioners.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the notice was valid. Although Atty. Mirasol filed the appeal documents, Atty. Capuchino remained the counsel of record because there was no formal withdrawal or substitution of counsel filed in accordance with Section 26, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court. As such, the petitioners were considered to be represented by two lawyers on record.

Under Section 2, Rule 46 of the Revised Rules of Court, attorneys of the parties in the court below are considered their attorneys in the Court of Appeals. Furthermore, the Court applied the doctrine established in *Dujon v. Villarosa* and *Ortega v. Pacho*, which holds that where a party is represented by two attorneys, service of notice or pleading on either of them is sufficient to bind such party. Since the notice to pay docket fees was validly served on Atty. Capuchino, the failure to pay said fees was a proper ground for dismissal.

The petitions are **DISMISSED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
