The source material provided appears to be incomplete, as it only contains the short title "Santos vs. Mojica" and the name of the Ponente, Justice Concepcion [1].

Without the full text of the decision—specifically the facts, issues, and ruling—I cannot create a case digest derived from your sources.

Would you like me to search for the full text of this Philippine Supreme Court decision so I can write the digest for you?
