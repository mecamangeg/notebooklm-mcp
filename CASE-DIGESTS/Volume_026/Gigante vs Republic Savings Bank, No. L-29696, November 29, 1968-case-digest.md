I. CAPTION
JESUS GIGANTE v. REPUBLIC SAVINGS BANK and ROLANDO MALLARI, G.R. No. L-29696, November 29, 1968, 26 SCRA 329, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Jesus Gigante obtained a judgment for a sum of money against Dominador Mallari on May 6, 1958, in the Municipal Court of Caloocan. However, the tax declaration of the house in question was transferred from Dominador to his son, defendant Rolando Mallari, on October 8, 1958. On April 24, 1959, Rolando mortgaged the house and the land (covered by a TCT in his name) to defendant Republic Savings Bank to secure a loan. This mortgage was duly recorded.

When Rolando defaulted, the Bank foreclosed and purchased the property at a public auction on June 28, 1960. Subsequently, on May 29, 1961, the Sheriff levied on the same house pursuant to Gigante's 1958 judgment against Dominador, and Gigante purchased it at the auction on June 23, 1961. Gigante filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Rizal to annul the transfer from Dominador to Rolando as fraudulent and to claim ownership. The lower court dismissed the complaint, declaring the Bank the owner.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Bank's registered mortgage is superior to Gigante's unregistered judgment and levy.
2. W/N the action for rescission of the transfer from Dominador to Rolando can prosper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Bank's right is based on a real estate mortgage duly recorded on April 24, 1959. In contrast, neither Gigante's judgment (1958) nor the Sheriff's levy (1961) and sale (1961) were recorded on the Torrens title. A registered mortgage is superior to an unregistered judgment, levy, and sale. Since the Bank acted in good faith and lawfully acquired ownership through foreclosure, the property is beyond the reach of Gigante's action. The Court cited *Sikatuna v. Guevarra* and *Gatchalian v. Manalo* to support the superiority of the registered interest.

2. **NO.** The action for rescission cannot prosper because the vendor, Dominador Mallari, was not impleaded. He is an indispensable party in an action for rescission of sale alleged to be fraudulent. The validity of the transfer to his son cannot be finally determined without his presence in court, as he is entitled to be heard.

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.
