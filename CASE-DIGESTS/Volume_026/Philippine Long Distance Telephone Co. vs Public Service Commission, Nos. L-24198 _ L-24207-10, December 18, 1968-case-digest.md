I. CAPTION
**PHILIPPINE LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE COMPANY v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION**, G.R. Nos. L-24198 & L-24207-10, December 18, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Following Typhoon "Dading" in June 1964, numerous complaints were filed against petitioner PLDT for inadequate service and delayed repairs in Manila and suburbs. While other utilities restored service quickly, many telephones remained unusable a month later. In hearings before the Public Service Commission (PSC), PLDT claimed the damage was too extensive for its limited workforce. However, a rebuttal expert testified that repairs could have been completed within 30 days had PLDT sought assistance from other agencies.

On August 18, 1964, the PSC ordered PLDT to complete all typhoon-related repairs by August 25, 1964, imposing a daily fine of P50.00 for non-compliance. PLDT filed a comprehensive 23-page Motion for Reconsideration (MR), citing transcripts and exhibits to argue that the deadline was unreasonable. The PSC denied the MR without conducting a hearing or oral argument on the motion. PLDT appealed, arguing a violation of the Public Service Act and due process, and claiming the PSC’s order was arbitrary.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the PSC's denial of the Motion for Reconsideration without a hearing violated due process.
2. W/N the PSC order imposing a deadline for repairs and daily fines was arbitrary or unsupported by evidence.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** While Section 34 of the Public Service Act (Commonwealth Act No. 146) generally provides for a hearing on motions for reconsideration, strict observance is not imperative, particularly given the proliferation of cases before the Commission. The Court held that PLDT’s 23-page motion contained a complete discussion of legal and factual grounds, quoting transcripts and exhibits, which adequately informed the Commission *en banc* of the issues. The absence of a hearing did not deprive the petitioner of due process because no material prejudice was shown, and the PSC, as a quasi-judicial body, is not strictly bound by procedural rules provided cardinal rights are not sacrificed (*Serrano v. Public Service Commission*).

2. **NO.** The PSC’s findings were supported by substantial evidence. PLDT's own witness admitted that 85-90% of the repair work had been accomplished by August 4, making the August 25 deadline reasonable. Furthermore, the Court rejected the argument that the fines were arbitrary for potentially covering future fortuitous events; the order was construed to apply only to situations connected to Typhoon "Dading" or existing troubles, and the Court will not overturn orders based on hypothetical possibilities (*Moreta v. Tan Chay*).

The orders appealed from are AFFIRMED.
