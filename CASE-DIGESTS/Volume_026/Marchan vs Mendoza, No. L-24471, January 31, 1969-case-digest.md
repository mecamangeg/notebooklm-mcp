I. CAPTION
SILVERIO MARCHAN and PHILIPPINE RABBIT BUS CO., INC. v. ARSENIO MENDOZA, LEONARDA ILAYA, and ZENAIDA MENDOZA, G.R. No. L-24471, January 31, 1969, 26 SCRA 89, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Silverio Marchan and Philippine Rabbit Bus Co., Inc. filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the Supreme Court’s decision promulgated on August 30, 1968. They specifically questioned the portion of the decision condemning them to pay P30,000.00 in exemplary damages, P5,000.00 in attorney's fees, and interest [1]. The Court of Appeals previously held the petitioners liable for exemplary damages, a ruling sustained by the Supreme Court [2]. In their motion, petitioners argued that exemplary damages were improper, citing *Rotea v. Halili* (claiming no participation by the employer in the wrongful act) and *Munsayac v. De Lara* (claiming the act must be coetaneous with the breach) [3], [4]. The underlying facts established that the petitioner's driver was found guilty of gross negligence and recklessness which caused injury to the respondents [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the award of exemplary damages to the respondents is proper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court denied the Motion for Reconsideration. Under **Article 2232 of the Civil Code**, in contracts and quasi-contracts, the court may award exemplary damages if the defendant acted in a "wanton, fraudulent, **reckless**, oppressive or malevolent manner" [5].

The Court held that the petitioners' reliance on *Rotea* and *Munsayac* was misplaced. *Rotea* involved subsidiary liability where no aggravating circumstances were present, while *Munsayac* involved acts subsequent to the breach of contract. Instead, the Court applied the ruling in *Laguna-Tayabas Bus Co. v. Diasanta*, establishing that where a driver (agent) is found guilty of **recklessness** (gross negligence), the award of exemplary damages against the carrier is justified under Article 2232 [5]. Consequently, since the award of exemplary damages is proper, the grant of attorney's fees is also justifiable [6].

**Motion for reconsideration denied.**
