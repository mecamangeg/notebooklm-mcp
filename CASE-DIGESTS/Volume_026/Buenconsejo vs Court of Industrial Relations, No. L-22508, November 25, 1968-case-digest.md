I. CAPTION
FLORO BUENCONSEJO v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, UNION OBRERA DE TABACO and TITO BILANGEL, G.R. No. L-22508, November 25, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Floro Buenconsejo filed his certificate of candidacy for president of the Union Obrera de Tabaco for the election scheduled on March 1, 1964 [1]. On February 14, 1964, the union returned his certificate, advising him that he could not participate [1, 2]. Buenconsejo filed an unfair labor practice charge against the union and Tito Bilangel with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) and sought a preliminary injunction to compel his inclusion as a candidate [2, 3]. Claiming the CIR failed to act on his urgent motion, he filed a petition for mandamus with the Supreme Court [4]. The Supreme Court issued a resolution ordering the CIR to act, but the election proceeded on March 1, 1964, without Buenconsejo’s participation because he failed to post the bond required by the CIR for the issuance of the writ [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for mandamus is moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court dismissed the petition as moot and academic for lack of justiciable controversy [6]. The respondents established that the election on March 1, 1964, was regularly held without the petitioner's participation [5]. This exclusion was due to the petitioner's admitted inability to post the required bond to secure the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction from the CIR [5]. Since the election had already concluded, the relief sought by the petitioner could no longer be granted. The petition was dismissed [6].
