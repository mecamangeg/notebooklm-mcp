I. CAPTION
MARIQUITA LUNA v. GERONIMO CARANDANG, G.R. No. L-27145, November 29, 1968, 26 SCRA 306, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
On March 6, 1962, Mariquita Luna (lessor) and Geronimo Carandang (lessee) entered into a 10-year lease contract involving agricultural land in Calapan, Oriental Mindoro. The contract stipulated that the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Batangas would have exclusive jurisdiction over any cases arising from the contract [1], [2]. Carandang failed to pay the stipulated rent for the first two years. On May 26, 1964, Luna filed a complaint for rescission with damages in the CFI of Batangas [3].

The trial court rendered a decision granting the rescission and damages due to non-payment of rent. However, the court declined to order Carandang to vacate the premises, ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to do so because the land was located in Oriental Mindoro [3]. Luna appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the stipulation conferring exclusive jurisdiction to the Court of Batangas is valid.
2. W/N the CFI of Batangas has jurisdiction to order the lessee to vacate and return the property situated in Oriental Mindoro.
3. W/N the plaintiff is entitled to the stipulated future rent after the filing of the action for rescission.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The stipulation that "the Court of Batangas shall have the exclusive jurisdiction" is void because jurisdiction is conferred by law and cannot be the subject matter of contracts [2]. However, the filing in Batangas was procedurally valid for different reasons (see below).

2. **YES.** A Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over suits involving title to or possession of real estate wherever situated in the Philippines, subject only to the rules on venue [4]. The rule requiring actions involving real property to be brought in the province where the land lies (Rule 4, Section 2) is a rule on venue, which may be waived expressly or impliedly [5]. In this case, Carandang impliedly waived the improper venue by answering and going to trial without objection [5]. Since rescission necessarily requires the return of the thing leased, the CFI, having acquired jurisdiction through waiver of venue, should have ordered the lessee to vacate and return the premises [5].

3. **NO.** Rescission and performance are incompatible [6]. Ordering payment of the stipulated rent for the remaining years would amount to performance. The plaintiff is entitled to unpaid rents only up to the filing of the rescission on May 26, 1964 [6]. Thereafter, the lessee is liable for the "reasonable rental value" of the land (fixed by the Court at P4,500/year) for as long as he retains possession [7].

The decision is **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS**; appellee is ordered to vacate the premises and pay reasonable rental value from the filing of the complaint until the land is returned [7].
