I. CAPTION
SINFOROSA ALCA v. HONORABLE COURT OF TAX APPEALS and THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-24624, November 27, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Sinforosa Alca, owner of Pacific Industrial Manufacturing (Phil.), manufactured rubbing alcohol using denatured alcohol from June 6, 1953, to August 24, 1960. She paid percentage sales taxes on these products. Following the Supreme Court decision in *Central Azucarera Don Pedro* (1960), the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed Alca on September 12, 1960, for unpaid specific taxes on the rubbing alcohol produced during the said period. Alca protested, arguing that the assessment had prescribed under the five-year period in Section 331 of the Tax Code. However, on December 9, 1959, Alca had signed a waiver extending the prescriptive period "beginning January 20, 1956... but not after December 31, 1966."

The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) sustained the assessment, ruling that Alca failed to file returns (transcript sheets not being considered returns), thus the ten-year prescriptive period under Section 332(a) applied. Alca appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the government's right to assess the specific tax has prescribed.
2. W/N the petitioner is liable for specific tax on rubbing alcohol produced after August 23, 1956.
3. W/N the petitioner is entitled to deduct the percentage taxes previously paid from the specific tax liability.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The assessment has not prescribed. Although the demand on September 12, 1960, was beyond the five-year period for taxes due from 1953 to 1955, the petitioner signed a waiver on December 9, 1959. The Court held that this waiver was not merely an extension of the period of limitation but a renunciation of the petitioner's right to invoke the defense of prescription which was already available to her. The right to avail of the defense of prescription is waivable (*Sambrano v. Court of Tax Appeals*).

2. **NO.** The petitioner is not liable for specific taxes on denatured alcohol used after the effectivity of Republic Act No. 1608. Citing *Abad v. Court of Tax Appeals*, the Court ruled that prior to August 23, 1956, the specific tax was payable by the producer of the finished product (rubbing alcohol). However, upon the amendment of Section 133 of the Tax Code by R.A. 1608 on August 23, 1956, liability shifted to the manufacturer, producer, owner, or possessor of the distilled spirits. Thus, Alca is not liable for specific tax on alcohol purchased and used after August 23, 1956.

3. **YES.** Elementary principles of equity dictate that Alca should be credited with the amounts she previously paid as percentage tax. Under Section 188 of the Tax Code, goods subject to specific tax are exempt from percentage tax, and vice-versa. Since the government is collecting the specific tax, the percentage tax payments made in good faith must be deducted (*Central Azucarera Don Pedro v. Court of Tax Appeals*).

The decision is **SET ASIDE**, and the records are **REMANDED** to the Court of Tax Appeals for re-hearing and recomputation of petitioner's tax liability.
