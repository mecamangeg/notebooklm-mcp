I. CAPTION
DIVERSIFIED CREDIT CORPORATION v. FELIPE ROSADO and LUZ JAYME ROSADO, G.R. No. L-27933, December 24, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Luz Jayme Rosado was one of 13 co-owners of Lot 62-B in Bacolod City, holding a 1/13 pro-indiviso share [3]. In 1957, her husband, Felipe Rosado, built a house on the lot without the property being partitioned among the co-owners [3]. On May 11, 1964, Luz Jayme and her co-owners sold the lot to Diversified Credit Corporation; however, Felipe did not give his conformity to the Deed of Sale [3, 4]. When the corporation demanded the spouses vacate the premises, Felipe refused, arguing that the house was conjugal property and, pursuant to Article 158 of the Civil Code, the construction of the house converted his wife's paraphernal share in the land into conjugal property, rendering the sale of that share void without his consent [5-7]. The Municipal Court ordered the spouses to vacate, and the Court of First Instance of Bacolod City affirmed this decision, rejecting the claim of conversion [2, 8]. The case was certified to the Supreme Court on questions of law [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the construction of a house at the expense of the conjugal partnership on land owned in common by one spouse converts that spouse's undivided share into conjugal property under Article 158 of the Civil Code. [9]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the appellant's thesis is legally untenable because, under the law of co-ownership, no individual co-owner can claim title to any definite portion of the land until partition [10]. Prior to partition, a co-owner possesses only an ideal or abstract quota of the entire thing owned in common [10]. Since Luz Jayme's share was never physically determined, the house constructed by her husband cannot be said to have been built on land "belonging to her" within the context of Article 158 of the Civil Code [11]. The Court emphasized that a house cannot be erected on an abstract undivided share [11]. Citing *Lopez v. Ilustre* and *Mercado v. Liwanag*, the Court reiterated that a co-owner has no right to sell or convey a divided, physical part of the real estate owned in common [10]. Consequently, the claim of conversion from paraphernal to conjugal property was rejected, and the husband was ordered to vacate without reimbursement as the construction was not done in good faith [11, 12]. The judgment of the Court of First Instance was affirmed [12].
