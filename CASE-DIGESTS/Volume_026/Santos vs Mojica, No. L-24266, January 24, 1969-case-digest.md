I. CAPTION
AMPARO D. SANTOS v. HON. ANGEL H. MOJICA, EMMA R. GENIZA, AURELIO GENIZA, CATALINA CARREON-RlVERA, ZACARIAS RlVERA, LORENZO RlVERA, THE SHERIFF OF MANILA and THE SHERIFF OF QUEZON CITY, G.R. No. L-24266, January 24, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Amparo D. Santos and her co-defendants were sued by respondents Emma R. Geniza et al. (plaintiffs) for damages resulting from fraud. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal rendered a decision on April 30, 1964, ordering the defendants to pay P100,000.00 plus interest, significant compensatory damages, and moral damages. Santos appealed the decision. While the appeal was pending perfection, the plaintiffs moved for immediate execution, arguing the appeal was dilatory. Judge Mojica granted the motion on November 19, 1964, unless the defendants filed a supersedeas bond within ten days. Santos failed to file the bond, leading to the issuance of a writ of execution and levies on her properties, salary, and stock shares. Santos filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court to annul the execution order, alleging grave abuse of discretion.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in ordering the execution of the judgment pending appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the execution of a decision pending appeal is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the court, which was properly exercised in this case. The Court cited several valid grounds for the execution:
1.  **Imminent Insolvency:** Santos's co-defendants had no property, and her own house was mortgaged for an amount exceeding its assessed value, placing her in imminent danger of insolvency [1].
2.  **Lack of Available Property:** No other property appeared available to satisfy the judgment as her other assets were subject to third-party claims or claimed as exempt for support [2].
3.  **Failure to File Bond:** Santos failed to file a supersedeas bond to stay the execution. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Javellana v. Querubin* that failure to avail of this remedy is sufficient ground to deny certiorari against an execution order [3].
4.  **Dilatory Appeal:** The trial court found the appeal was taken for delay, as the evidence of fraud—including handwriting analysis—was strong. A finding that an appeal is dilatory is sufficient to justify execution pending appeal (*Iloilo Trading Center & Exchange v. Rodas*) [4].

The petition was dismissed and the writ of preliminary injunction was dissolved.
