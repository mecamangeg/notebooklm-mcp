I. CAPTION
NATIONAL MARKETING CORPORATION v. GABINO MARQUEZ, ET AL. and PLARIDEL SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY, G.R. No. L-25553, January 31, 1969, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On June 24, 1950, Gabino Marquez acquired a tractor and rice thresher from the Philippine Relief and Trade Rehabilitation Administration (PRATRA), the predecessor of the National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO). Marquez paid a down payment and executed a promissory note for the balance of P12,000.00, payable in installments from June 1951 to June 1952, with 7% interest per annum and a stipulation for 10% attorney's fees in case of default [1, 2]. To guarantee the obligation, Marquez and Plaridel Surety & Insurance Company executed a Guaranty Bond, binding themselves jointly and severally to pay the P12,000.00 [2]. The surety expressly waived the right to demand payment and notice of non-payment [3].

Marquez defaulted after making partial payments. NAMARCO sent written demands to the defendants in 1956, 1963, and 1964 [3]. On December 16, 1964, NAMARCO filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to collect the principal sum of P10,000.00 plus accrued interest and attorney's fees [4, 5]. The CFI ruled in favor of NAMARCO. Plaridel Surety appealed directly to the Supreme Court, questioning the lower court's jurisdiction, the prescription of the action, and the extent of its liability [4, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction over the case.
2. W/N the action against the surety is barred by prescription.
3. W/N the surety’s liability can exceed the bond limit of P12,000.00 to include accrued interest.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of First Instance had jurisdiction. Under Republic Act No. 3828, the CFI has original jurisdiction over cases where the demand, exclusive of interest, exceeds P10,000.00. Here, the demand consisted of P10,000.00 in principal and P1,000.00 in attorney's fees (10% of the amount due), totaling P11,000.00, which is within the CFI's jurisdictional amount [5].

2. **NO.** The action is not barred by prescription. While the promissory note fell due in 1952 and the case was filed in 1964, the course of extinctive prescription was interrupted by written extrajudicial demands made by the creditor in 1956, 1963, and 1964 pursuant to Article 1115 of the Civil Code [7]. A demand upon the principal debtor interrupts prescription against the surety, especially since the surety is solidarily liable and waived notice of non-payment [8, 9].

3. **YES.** The surety is liable for interest and costs beyond the original P12,000.00 bond. Under Article 2055 of the Civil Code, a simple or indefinite guaranty comprises not only the principal obligation but also all its accessories, including judicial costs [9, 10]. Furthermore, compensated sureties are not entitled to have their contracts interpreted *strictissimi juris* in their favor [11]. The judgment for P10,000.00 principal plus moratory interest merely enforces the indemnity for damages due to the delay (mora), which is a legal consequence of the principal obligation [12].

The judgment of the Court of First Instance is AFFIRMED [11].
