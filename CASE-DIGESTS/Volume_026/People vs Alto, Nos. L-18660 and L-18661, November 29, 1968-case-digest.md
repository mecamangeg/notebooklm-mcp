I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JOSE ALTO, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-18660 and L-18661, November 29, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Jose Alto and Eduardo Joson were political rivals for the mayoralty of Quezon, Nueva Ecija. On November 12, 1950, Huk dissidents ambushed Joson's group, wounding Joson and others (Frustrated Murder). On December 15, 1951, Huks again ambushed Joson's group, killing three policemen (Multiple Murder). The prosecution linked Alto to the crimes solely on the theory that he gave a P2,000 reward to the Huks for Joson's liquidation. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Nueva Ecija convicted Alto based largely on the testimony of Laureano Salvador, a self-confessed accomplice who claimed to witness the payment; Toribio Garcia, a former Huk; and a sworn statement by co-accused Melencio Marcos. Alto appealed, arguing the evidence was insufficient and the witnesses lacked credibility.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice and the other prosecution evidence were sufficient to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s decision. The Court held that while the law does not exclude accomplice testimony, it must be exercised with the greatest caution. Citing *People v. Asinas*, the Court emphasized that a conviction cannot be sustained on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice; there must be other evidence tending to show the guilt of the defendant.

Here, the testimony of the accomplice Salvador was uncorroborated on vital points, particularly the alleged delivery of money. His testimony was also marred by material contradictions and rendered suspicious by his long silence of four years before testifying. The Court also rejected the testimony of Garcia for being inconsistent with Salvador’s account and inherently improbable, noting that human testimony must conform to common experience (*Daggers v. Van Dyke*). Furthermore, the sworn statement of co-accused Marcos was inadmissible because it was retracted and proven to have been obtained through promises of leniency by Mayor Joson. A confession made under the influence of a threat or promise of reward is inadmissible (*U.S. v. Caballeros*). The prosecution failed to overturn the presumption of innocence with competent proof.

Appellant Jose Alto is ACQUITTED.
