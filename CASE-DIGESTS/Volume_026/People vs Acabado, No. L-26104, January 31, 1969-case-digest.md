I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CELSO ACABADO, G.R. No. L-26104, January 31, 1969, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of May 14, 1963, during the barrio fiesta of San Isidro, Samar, Manuel Penis and Sunday Jabole were walking towards the seashore. Suddenly, Celso Acabado approached them from the opposite direction and stabbed Manuel in the epigastric region before running away. Despite the sudden attack, Manuel recognized Acabado, stating, "I know you. You are Celso Acabado." Jabole also positively identified the assailant. Manuel later gave a dying declaration identifying Acabado to the barrio lieutenant and his mother before dying of internal hemorrhage.

Acabado raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was at a dance in Barrio Nato, nine kilometers away. The Court of First Instance of Samar convicted Acabado of homicide, ruling that the attack was not treacherous because it was frontal. The case was certified to the Supreme Court by the Court of Appeals, which found that the crime committed was murder punishable by *reclusion perpetua*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the killing was attended by treachery qualifying the crime to murder.
2. W/N the defense of alibi should be sustained.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that treachery was present. Although the attack was frontal, it was sudden and committed in the dark, rendering the victim unable to defend himself [1]. Consequently, the crime is qualified as murder, not homicide.

2. **NO.** The Court rejected the defense of alibi, noting it is one of the weakest defenses and easily fabricated. Acabado was positively identified by an eyewitness and the victim himself. Furthermore, it was not physically impossible for the accused to be at the scene, as the distance could be covered in 30 minutes by bicycle or less than two hours on foot [2].

The judgment is **MODIFIED**. Appellant Celso Acabado is sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* for the crime of murder. The civil indemnity is increased from P6,000.00 to P12,000.00 in accordance with *People v. Pantoja* [3].
