I. CAPTION
ANTHONY CHAN v. OCEANIC WIRELESS NETWORK, INC., G.R. No. L-22705, November 27, 1968, 26 SCRA 68, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On July 18, 1962, Anthony Chan filed an action for damages against Oceanic Wireless Network, Inc. in the Justice of the Peace Court of Mati, Davao. The court rendered judgment in favor of Chan. On October 26, 1962, within the reglementary period, the defendant filed a notice of appeal and deposited a P25.00 appeal bond, but only remitted P12.00 for the appellate court docket fee via postal money order [1].

The plaintiff moved to dismiss the appeal because the correct docket fee under Rule 30, Section 5 of the old Rules of Court was P32.00, not P12.00. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao dismissed the appeal for failure to pay the full docket fee [2]. Oceanic Wireless moved for reconsideration, arguing substantial compliance and claiming the deficiency was due to an honest mistake in computation by its counsel, a new practitioner. The CFI denied the motion [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal to the Court of First Instance was perfected despite the failure to pay the full appellate court docket fee.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. The rule is settled that in appeals from inferior courts to the Court of First Instance, the appellate court docket fee must be deposited in full within the fifteen-day period [4]. If only half is deposited and the balance is tendered after the period expires, the appeal is not deemed perfected (*Gambol v. Barcelona*, citing *Lazaro v. Endencia*).

While the Court has relaxed this rule in cases where government officials (clerks of court or treasurers) misled the appellant, no such circumstance existed here [4, 5]. The failure to pay was due to the inexcusable negligence or ignorance of the defendant's counsel. Under Rule 30, Section 5 of the old Rules of Court, no computation was necessary to determine the fee. Furthermore, the P12.00 paid was even below the statutory minimum of P16.00, proving counsel did not refer to the Rules. The fact that counsel was a new practitioner does not justify negligence; rather, it should have made him more careful [6].

The order appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellant.
