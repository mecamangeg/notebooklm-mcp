I. CAPTION
RAUL R. INGLES, ET AL. v. AMELITO R. MUTUC, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20390, November 29, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Raul R. Ingles and others were civil service eligibles holding WAPCO-classified positions (Senior Executive Assistant II, Clerk I, Supervising Clerk I, and Stenographer) in the "Private Secretaries" subdivision of the Office of the President [1, 2]. In January 1962, Executive Secretary Amelito Mutuc informed them that their services were terminated as of January 1, 1962 [3]. Plaintiffs appealed to the President, but Mutuc denied the appeal [3].

Plaintiffs filed a suit for reinstatement and back pay [3]. Defendants argued that plaintiffs occupied positions that were "primarily confidential" and, therefore, subject to removal at the pleasure of the appointing power [4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that the positions were primarily confidential because plaintiffs handled confidential matters [2, 4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs' positions are primarily confidential and subject to termination at the pleasure of the appointing power.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision.

First, the Court clarified the doctrine regarding "primarily confidential" positions. It held that the assumption that such officers are subject to "removal" at pleasure is inaccurate [4]. Instead, when the appointing power's confidence is lost, the officer is not "removed" or "dismissed," but rather their term merely "expires" [6]. This is because the term of a confidential officer is indefinite and ends when the appointing power decides to terminate the services [6].

However, in this specific case, the Court found that the defendants failed to prove that the plaintiffs actually held primarily confidential positions [7]. Although their items were listed under "Private Secretaries" in the budget, the designations and compensation (e.g., Clerk, Stenographer) indicated purely or mainly clerical work [8]. The Court ruled that the fact that an employee handles confidential matters at times does not characterize their position as *primarily* confidential, drawing an analogy to physicians and judges who handle confidential matters but are not confidential employees [8, 9]. Since plaintiffs did not belong to the excepted class of primarily confidential positions, they were protected by the Civil Service Law and could not be removed without cause [7].

The decision was reversed, and plaintiffs were ordered reinstated with back pay from January 1, 1962 [10].
