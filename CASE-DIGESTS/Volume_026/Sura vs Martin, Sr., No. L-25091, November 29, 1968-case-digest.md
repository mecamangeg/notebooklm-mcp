I. CAPTION
NILDA SURA, in her behalf and in behalf of her minor child VICENTE MARTIN, JR. v. VICENTE SILVESTRE MARTIN, SR., G.R. No. L-25091, November 29, 1968, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
In a civil case for acknowledgment and support, the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental ordered defendant Vicente Martin, Sr. to recognize the minor plaintiff and pay P100.00 monthly for past and future support, plus attorney's fees [1, 2]. The Court of Appeals affirmed this decision [3]. A writ of execution was issued, but the Provincial Sheriff returned it unsatisfied, reporting that the defendant was jobless, possessed no leviable property, and was certified insolvent by the Municipal Treasurer [4].

Plaintiff filed a motion to declare the defendant in contempt for failure to satisfy the writ [5]. The trial court granted the defendant a period to pay, but upon his failure to do so, issued orders on January 9 and February 1, 1965, directing his arrest and confinement until he complied with the judgment [6, 7]. The defendant appealed these orders to the Supreme Court [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendant can be held in contempt and imprisoned for failure to satisfy the judgment for support.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the orders of arrest and imprisonment [9].

The Court held that the judgment ordering the payment of support was a final disposition of the case enforceable by a writ of execution under Rule 39, Section 8 of the Rules of Court, specifically directing the sheriff to satisfy the amount from the debtor's property [10]. It was not a "special judgment" under Rule 39, Section 9—defined as one requiring the performance of an act *other than* the payment of money or delivery of property—which is the only type of judgment enforceable by contempt proceedings under Rule 71, Section 3(b) [11].

Furthermore, the writ of execution is an order directed to the sheriff, not the judgment debtor; thus, the debtor could not technically disobey it [10]. Finally, because the defendant was proven insolvent, ordering his imprisonment for failure to pay would violate the Constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt [11].
