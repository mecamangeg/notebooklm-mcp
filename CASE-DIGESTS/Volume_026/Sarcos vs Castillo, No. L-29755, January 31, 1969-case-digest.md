I. CAPTION
DOMINGO N. SARCOS v. HON. RECAREDO CASTILLO, et al., G.R. No. L-29755, January 31, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Domingo N. Sarcos, the elected Mayor of Barobo, Surigao del Sur, was charged with misconduct and dishonesty in office by respondent Governor Recaredo Castillo for allegedly conniving to cut and sell timber from a communal forest for personal use. Sarcos denied the charges, claiming the logs were seized by police and sold to fund police uniforms. Respondent Governor issued an administrative order preventing suspending Sarcos from office, citing Section 5 of Republic Act No. 5185 (The Decentralization Act of 1967), and designated the Vice-Mayor as Acting Mayor. Sarcos filed an original petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court, challenging the Governor's authority to order the suspension under the new law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Provincial Governor has the power to preventively suspend a Municipal Mayor under the Decentralization Act of 1967 (RA 5185).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the power of preventive suspension is not lodged in the Provincial Governor but in the Provincial Board under Section 5 of RA 5185. While the former law (Section 2188 of the Revised Administrative Code) authorized the Governor to order preventive suspension, this was repealed by the Decentralization Act.

The Court applied the rule of strict construction regarding laws on the suspension and removal of elective officials, citing *Lacson v. Roque*. The deliberate elimination of the Governor's power in the new statute manifests the legislative intent to vest such authority solely in the Provincial Board. This interpretation accords with the Act's declared policy of local autonomy and decentralization. Furthermore, lodging the power in a collective body like the Provincial Board, rather than a single individual, serves as a safeguard against the use of suspension for partisan harassment.

The writs were granted, the preventive suspension was annulled and set aside, and the immediate reinstatement of the petitioner was ordered.
