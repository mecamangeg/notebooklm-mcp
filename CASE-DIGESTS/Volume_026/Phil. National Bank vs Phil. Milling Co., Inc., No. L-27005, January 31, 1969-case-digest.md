I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK and DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PHILIPPINE MILLING CO., INC., HECTOR TORRES, FRANCISCO GOMEZ and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-27005, January 31, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Philippine Milling Co., Inc., et al. appealed a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila to the Court of Appeals (CA) regarding Civil Cases Nos. 42133 and 42322 [1]. In the CA, respondents obtained two extensions to file their brief. They requested a third extension on November 14, 1966, which was granted for only 10 days, expiring on November 21, 1966 [2]. On November 24, 1966—three days after the expiration of the period—respondents filed a motion for a fourth extension [2]. Petitioners PNB and DBP moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the extension was sought late and the CA had lost jurisdiction [2-4]. The CA granted the respondents' extension and denied the petitioners' motions to dismiss [2, 3]. Petitioners filed this suit for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus, asserting that the CA had a ministerial duty to dismiss the appeal due to the late filing [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals has a ministerial duty to dismiss an appeal when the appellant fails to file a motion for extension of time to file their brief within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court of Appeals does not lose jurisdiction and is not bound by a ministerial duty to dismiss the appeal in such cases. The Supreme Court ruled that under Section 1, Rule 50 of the Rules of Court, an appeal "*may* be dismissed" for failure to file a brief within the reglementary period [4]. This provision confers a power, not a duty, and is directory rather than mandatory [4]. The CA has the discretion to dismiss or not to dismiss, which must be exercised soundly in accordance with the tenets of justice and fair play [5, 6]. The petitioners failed to show that the CA abused this discretion [5, 6]. The claim that dismissal is "ministerial" is devoid of legal foundation and inconsistent with the Court's views in *Viuda de Ordoveza v. Raymundo* and *Alquiza v. Alquiza* [5-7].

The petition is **DISMISSED** and the writs prayed for are **DENIED** [7].
