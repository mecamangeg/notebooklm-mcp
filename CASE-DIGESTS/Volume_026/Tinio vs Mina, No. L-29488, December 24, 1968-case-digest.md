I. CAPTION
ANGEL M. TINIO v. DALMACIO MINA, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-29488, L-29489, & L-29490, December 24, 1968, 26 SCRA 512, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Angel M. Tinio, a landholder, sought to eject his tenants (respondents Dalmacio Mina, Florencio Antonio, and Bartolome Natividad) to mechanize his farm. Under the previous law, the Agricultural Tenancy Act (R.A. 1199), dispossession for mechanization was allowed subject to certification by the Agricultural Tenancy Commission and the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA). Tinio obtained these certifications in March and May 1963.

However, on August 8, 1963, the Agricultural Land Reform Code (R.A. 3844) took effect. Section 168 of the new Code preserved pending mechanization applications only if proper notices were served on tenants at least two months prior to the Code's approval. Tinio filed his complaints for mechanization in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) only in July and August 1965, almost two years after the new Code took effect. The tenants moved to dismiss, arguing the CAR lacked jurisdiction under Section 168. Tinio opposed, contending that Section 168 was unconstitutional for being retroactive and depriving him of a vested right acquired under the old law. The CAR dismissed the cases.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Section 168 of the Agricultural Land Reform Code is unconstitutional for violating due process by retroactively impairing vested rights.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. The Court held that Section 168 is essentially procedural in nature. Under the doctrine in *Gregorio v. Court of Appeals* and *Laurel v. Misa*, there is no constitutional objection to the retroactive application of procedural laws, and no vested rights attach to remedies or procedure [1, 2].

Even assuming the right was substantive, the Court ruled there was no violation of due process. Due process signifies freedom from arbitrariness and is the embodiment of fair play (*Ermita-Malate Hotel Assn. v. Mayor of Manila*). The enactment of the Land Reform Code was widely discussed, and landholders were not left in the dark. Tinio failed to exercise his rights under the previous statute timely, allowing two years to lapse before filing suit. Consequently, he cannot claim his rights were arbitrarily violated [3-5].

The Orders of the Court of Agrarian Relations dismissing the complaints are AFFIRMED [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Concepcion, C.J.** concurs in the result [6].
**Reyes, J.B.L., J.** concurs on the ground that the petitions do not state a cause of action [6].
