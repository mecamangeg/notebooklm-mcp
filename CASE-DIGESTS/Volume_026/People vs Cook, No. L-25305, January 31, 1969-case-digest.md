I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CONCHITA COOK and S/SGT. DONALD COOK, G.R. No. L-25305, January 31, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
The City Fiscal of Angeles City prosecuted Donald Cook and Conchita Cook for the crime of estafa involving the sum of P5,100.00 [1]. The defendants filed a motion to quash the information on the ground that the City Court of Angeles City did not have jurisdiction over the offense charged [1]. The City Court granted the motion and dismissed the case [1]. The State appealed the order of dismissal to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the City Court of Angeles City has jurisdiction over the estafa case involving the amount of P5,100.00.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the City Court has jurisdiction. The Court interpreted Section 87 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended by Republic Act No. 3823, finding no conflict between paragraphs (b) and (c) [2]. Paragraph (b) grants municipal judges original and *exclusive* jurisdiction over estafa cases where the amount involved does not exceed P200.00 [2]. Paragraph (c) grants municipal judges in chartered cities original but *concurrent* jurisdiction with the Court of First Instance over offenses where the penalty provided by law does not exceed *prision correccional*, or imprisonment for not more than six years, or a fine not exceeding P6,000.00 [2].

Since the penalty prescribed by Article 315, paragraph 3 of the Revised Penal Code for estafa involving P5,100.00 is *arresto mayor* in its maximum period to *prision correccional* in its minimum period, it falls within the concurrent jurisdiction defined in paragraph (c) [3].

The order appealed from is set aside and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [3].
