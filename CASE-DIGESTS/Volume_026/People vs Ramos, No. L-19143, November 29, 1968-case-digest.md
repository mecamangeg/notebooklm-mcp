**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SANTOS RAMOS, PEDRO ALEMANIA, LUCILO ESMA and ALFONSO ESMA, G.R. No. L-19143, November 29, 1968, Dizon, J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
On the evening of January 24, 1960, in a restaurant owned by appellant Alfonso Esma in Mainit, Surigao del Norte, the victim, Agapito Montaner, Jr., entered the premises [3]. Appellant Lucilo Esma approached Agapito and placed his right arm over the victim's left shoulder [3]. As Agapito struggled to free himself, appellant Santos Ramos approached from behind and stabbed him in the left side with a double-bladed dagger [3, 4]. Immediately after, appellant Pedro Alemania punched the victim in the face, and Alfonso Esma pushed the victim out of the restaurant, where he subsequently died [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance of Surigao convicted Santos Ramos of Murder as principal and the other appellants as accomplices [2]. The appellants appealed, claiming insufficiency of evidence and arguing that if Santos Ramos was guilty, the crime should only be Homicide [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the killing was attended by treachery, qualifying the crime to Murder.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that the attack was treacherous. The evidence clearly established that Santos Ramos stabbed the victim from behind while the latter was rendered "to a certain degree, helpless" because co-accused Lucilo Esma had his right arm over the victim's left shoulder [5-7]. This method of attack deprived the victim of the opportunity to defend himself [5, 6]. Consequently, the crime committed is Murder, not Homicide [5].

The decision is **AFFIRMED** except as to indemnity [1].
