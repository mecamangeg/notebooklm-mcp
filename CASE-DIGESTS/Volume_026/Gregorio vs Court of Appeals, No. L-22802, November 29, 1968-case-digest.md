I. CAPTION
MAXIMO H. GREGORIO v. COURT OF APPEALS and LORENZO G. VALENTIN, G.R. No. L-22802, November 29, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner’s deceased father, the original appellant, sought to elevate the evidence presented in two appealed cases to the Court of Appeals (CA). He invoked Section 2, Rule 41 of the Revised Rules of Court (effective January 1, 1964), which allows a party appealing from a denial of relief under Rule 38 to also assail the judgment on the merits [1]. The CA denied the motion and the subsequent motion for reconsideration, ruling that the appeal was perfected before the Revised Rules took effect. The CA held that applying the new rule would create a new right in derogation of the appellee's vested rights and would delay the disposition of the case [2]. Petitioner filed a special action for certiorari and mandamus to annul the CA resolutions [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Section 2, Rule 41 of the Revised Rules of Court should be applied retroactively to the pending appeal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the retroactive application of a procedural law does not violate any right of a party who may feel adversely affected [4]. Citing the doctrine in *Enrile v. CFI of Bulacan* and *Billones v. CIR*, the Court reiterated that statutes regulating court procedure are applicable to cases pending at the time of their passage because they affect procedure rather than substantive rights [5, 6].

While Rule 144 of the Revised Rules of Court allows a court to deny retroactive application if it "would not be feasible or would work injustice," this exception did not apply to the case at bar [7]. On the contrary, refusing to apply the new rule would work injustice by preventing the petitioner from disputing the merits of the decision due to a lack of evidentiary support [7, 8].

The writs of certiorari and mandamus were **GRANTED**, annulling the CA resolutions and compelling the CA to elevate the evidence [8].
