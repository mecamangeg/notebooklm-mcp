I. CAPTION
ENRIQUE V. MORALES v. ABELARDO SUBIDO, as Commissioner of Civil Service, G.R. No. L-29658, November 29, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Enrique Morales, the Chief of the Detective Bureau of the Manila Police Department (MPD) holding the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, was designated Acting Chief of Police of Manila by the City Mayor following the resignation of the incumbent. Morales had risen from the ranks since 1934 but did not possess a bachelor's degree. Respondent Civil Service Commissioner Abelardo Subido rejected Morales' appointment for failure to meet the minimum educational and civil service eligibility requirements prescribed by Section 10 of the Police Act of 1966 (Republic Act No. 4864). Subido announced the vacancy and listed the qualifications, which included a bachelor's degree. Morales demanded inclusion in the list of qualified eligibles, arguing that under Section 10, his service as a captain for more than three years was an alternative qualification that exempted him from the bachelor's degree requirement. When Subido refused, Morales filed a petition for mandamus.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a person who has served as a captain in a city police department for at least three years but possesses only a high school diploma is qualified for appointment as Chief of Police under the Police Act of 1966.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that Section 10 of Republic Act No. 4864 clearly requires a bachelor's degree as a minimum educational qualification for appointment as Chief of Police, in addition to the requisite service experience.

The Court interpreted Section 10 to mean that no person may be appointed unless he holds a bachelor's degree *and* meets one of the specific service requirements (service in AFP/NBI, or as chief of police, or as captain for three years). The only exception provided in the law is for a "high school graduate who has served as officer in the Armed Forces for at least eight years with the rank of captain and/or higher." Morales did not fall under this exception.

The Court applied the **Enrolled Bill Theory**, citing *Mabanag v. Lopez Vito*. The Court held that the text of the Act, which was signed by the presiding officers of both Houses of Congress and approved by the President, imports absolute verity and is binding on the courts. Although legislative records suggested a proposed amendment (the "Rodrigo amendment") might have intended to include high school graduates with city police service, this phrase was not found in the final Enrolled Bill. The judiciary cannot supply omissions in the law, whether careless or calculated. Therefore, Morales was neither qualified nor eligible.

Petition denied.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Dizon, J., Concurring:**
Justice Dizon concurred in the result. He noted that while Morales' interpretation of the ambiguous provision was "not unreasonable," it failed to establish a clear legal right or an imperative duty on the part of the respondent necessary for the issuance of a writ of mandamus.
