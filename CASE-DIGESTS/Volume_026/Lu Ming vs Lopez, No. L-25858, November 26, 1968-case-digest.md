I. CAPTION
LU MING, LAM LOY and LEE E. WON v. VICENTE LOPEZ, TIMOTEO FERNANDEZ, FRANCISCO LEE LLACER, LEONG CHEW, KOK KO, MANILA CANTONESE ASSOCIATION, INC. and the REGISTER OF DEEDS OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-25858, November 26, 1968, Concepcion, C.J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs (Lu Ming, et al.) and defendants (Vicente Lopez, et al.) were members of the *Asociacion Cantonesa de Manila*, a corporation whose 50-year term expired on September 1, 1958 [3]. Just prior to expiration, the 1958 Board of Directors (including plaintiffs) constituted themselves as a Board of Liquidators [3]. However, plaintiffs lost their bid for re-election in 1961, and the defendants were elected as the new Board of Directors [3]. On March 31, 1961, the new Board constituted themselves as the new Board of Liquidators and authorized the conveyance of the *Asociacion's* properties to the newly organized *Manila Cantonese Association, Inc.* (Corporation) [4]. The transfer was executed, and a new title (T.C.T. No. 63964) was issued to the Corporation [4]. In 1965, plaintiffs filed a complaint to compel the Register of Deeds to cancel the new title, claiming they acted as trustees of the dissolved *Asociacion* [2, 5]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint on the ground that plaintiffs lacked the legal capacity to sue [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N plaintiffs have the legal capacity to sue as trustees of the dissolved corporation to recover its property. [6]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the plaintiffs lacked authority to sue [7, 8]. The Court reasoned that plaintiffs ceased to be members of the Board of Directors in 1960 when their successors were elected, thus ending their authority to participate in the liquidation [5]. Furthermore, there was no allegation that the properties were ever conveyed to the plaintiffs as trustees [7]. Under Sections 77 and 78 of the Corporation Law (Act No. 1459), the *Asociacion* effectively lost its juridical existence for purposes of liquidation on September 1, 1961, three years after its dissolution [7, 9]. Since the corporation itself could no longer bring the action after the three-year statutory period, the plaintiffs, who held no title to the property, were similarly barred from suing [7, 9]. The order appealed from is affirmed [8].
