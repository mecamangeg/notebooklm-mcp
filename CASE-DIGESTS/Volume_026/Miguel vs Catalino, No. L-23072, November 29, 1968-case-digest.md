I. CAPTION
SIMEON B. MIGUEL, ET AL. v. FLORENDO CATALINO, G.R. No. L-23072, November 29, 1968, 26 SCRA 234, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
The subject property is a parcel of land in Tuba, Benguet, covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 31 issued in 1927 in the name of Bacaquio, a non-Christian resident. In 1928, Bacaquio sold the land to Catalino Agyapao, the father of defendant Florendo Catalino, for P300.00. No formal deed was executed, and the sale lacked the approval of the Provincial Governor, which was required for conveyances by non-Christians. Agyapao and subsequently the defendant occupied, cultivated, improved, and paid taxes on the land for over 30 years. Bacaquio died in 1943.

In 1962, Bacaquio's heirs (petitioners) filed a complaint for recovery of possession, claiming ownership under the OCT. They argued the 1928 sale was void. One of the heirs, Grace Ventura, had also executed a document in 1949 "selling" the land again to the defendant. The trial court dismissed the complaint and declared the defendant the owner. The petitioners appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners’ action to recover the land is barred by laches despite the 1928 sale being void ab initio.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal.

The Court conceded that the 1928 sale was **void ab initio** under the Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu (Sections 145[b] and 146) due to the lack of executive approval [1, 2]. Consequently, Bacaquio remained the owner in law until his death [3].

However, the Court ruled that the petitioners are barred from recovering the property due to **laches**. Laches is different from prescription; while prescription is a matter of time and statutory law, laches is based on the inequity of permitting a claim to be enforced [4]. The Court found all four elements of laches present: (a) conduct of the defendant giving rise to the complaint; (b) delay by the complainants in asserting their rights despite opportunity; (c) lack of notice to the defendant that rights would be asserted; and (d) injury or prejudice to the defendant if relief is granted [5].

Bacaquio and his heirs allowed the defendant to possess and improve the land for 34 years (1928–1962) without protest. The Court held that it cannot look with favor upon parties who, by their silence and inaction, induce another to spend time and effort on a property, only to "spring from ambush" and claim title when values have risen. Thus, despite the registered title, the equitable defense of laches applies [3].

The decision of the lower court was **AFFIRMED**.
