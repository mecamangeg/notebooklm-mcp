I. CAPTION
ILOILO DOCK & ENGINEERING CO., petitioner, vs. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and IRENEA M. PABLO, for herself and in behalf of her minor children EDWIN, EDGAR and EDNA, all surnamed PABLO, respondents., G.R. No. L-26341, November 27, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Teodoro G. Pablo, a mechanic employed by petitioner Iloilo Dock & Engineering Co. (IDECO), finished his overtime work at 5:00 P.M. on January 29, 1960 [1]. While walking home at about 5:02 P.M., he was shot to death on a private road known as the "IDECO road," approximately 20 meters away from the petitioner's main gate [1]. The assailant, Martin Cordero, was killed before he could be tried, and the motive for the crime remained unknown [1]. Although IDECO denied ownership of the road, the road led directly to the main gate and was used as the principal means of ingress and egress for the company and its employees [2], [3]. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed the Regional Office's decision awarding compensation to Pablo's widow and children, ruling that the death occurred within the employment zone [4], [5]. IDECO appealed, arguing that the injury happened off-premises and did not arise out of or in the course of employment [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the employee's death, which occurred outside the employer's premises but on a road serving as the principal access, is compensable under the Workmen's Compensation Act.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the WCC decision, holding that the injury is compensable under the "proximity rule" exception to the general "going and coming" rule [7], [8].

The Court explained that employment includes not only the actual work but also a reasonable margin of time and space for passing to and from the workplace [9]. While injuries sustained off-premises are generally not compensable, an exception exists when the injury happens in close proximity to the premises while using a customary means of ingress and egress [10]. The "IDECO road," being the chief means of access and in close proximity (20 meters) to the gate, is considered an "access area" so clearly related to the employer's premises as to be treated as part of it [11]. Because the injury occurred in the *course* of employment (satisfied by the proximity and time factors), the law presumes it also *arose* out of employment, even if the motive for the assault was unexplained [12]. IDECO was under an obligation to keep this access area safe for its employees [11].

Decision affirmed [8].
