I. CAPTION
ANTONINO M. MILANES v. EULOGIO F. DE GUZMAN, Provincial Governor of La Union, VICE-GOVERNOR and MEMBERS OF THE PROVINCIAL BOARD of La Union, G.R. No. L-23967, November 29, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Antonino M. Milanes, the Mayor of Agoo, La Union, acted as a toastmaster during a political rally for the Nacionalista Party on November 13, 1961 [1, 2]. During his speech, he ridiculed Rolando Rivera's physical defect, then descended from the stage, shook Rivera by the neck, and threatened to kill him if he persisted in attacking Milanes' administration [2]. Rivera filed criminal cases against Milanes, which were dismissed [3]. Rivera also filed administrative charges with Respondent Governor Eulogio De Guzman, who subsequently suspended Milanes from office on February 8, 1962, for oppression, abuse of authority, and misconduct in office [1, 4].

Milanes filed a petition for prohibition and injunction with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of La Union, arguing the acts were not grounds for suspension under Section 2188 of the Revised Administrative Code [1, 5]. The CFI ruled in favor of Milanes, making the injunctions permanent [6]. Respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved purely questions of law [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the acts of the Mayor committed during a political rally constitute misconduct in office under Section 2188 of the Revised Administrative Code to justify administrative suspension.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that the acts did not constitute misconduct in office [7].

The Court held that under Section 2188 of the Revised Administrative Code, a municipal officer may be suspended for (1) maladministration "of office" or (2) conviction by final judgment of a crime involving moral turpitude [3]. Since there was no final conviction, the ground relied upon must be misconduct "in office" [8].

To warrant suspension, the misconduct must be committed in the performance of official duties [8]. Here, Milanes was acting in his private capacity as a toastmaster for a political party, not discharging his duties as Mayor [9]. His acts of slander and threats were personal, motivated by wounded pride rather than official function [10, 11]. Citing *Lacson v. Roque* and *Mondano v. Silvosa*, the Court emphasized that not all acts of a mayor during their tenure are official acts; there must be a connection to the performance of duties or the use of official power [11, 12].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [7].
