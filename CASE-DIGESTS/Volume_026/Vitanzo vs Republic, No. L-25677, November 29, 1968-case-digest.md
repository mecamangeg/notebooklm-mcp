I. CAPTION
JOVITO O. VITANZO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, represented by THE BOARD OF LIQUIDATORS OF THE DEFUNCT NATIONAL COCONUT CORPORATION, ILDEFONSO LABAO, MARCELO MANTALA, ESTEFANIA DE MUHI and VICTORINO MORENO, G.R. No. L-25677, November 29, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Eusebio Arceo was the registered owner of five parcels of land in Marinduque. In a separate civil case, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila rendered a final judgment against Arceo and in favor of the Republic of the Philippines for a sum of money. A writ of execution was issued on February 2, 1962. The Provincial Sheriff of Marinduque received the writ on July 7, 1962, and levied on Arceo's lands on the same date [1]. The execution sale was conducted on March 16, 1963, where the properties were sold to the Republic and other private defendants [1].

Arceo died, and his heirs assigned their rights to the lands to petitioner Jovito Vitanzo on February 13, 1964. Vitanzo subsequently filed a complaint for reconveyance in the CFI of Marinduque, arguing that the levy and sale were null and void because the levy was not made during the lifetime of the writ [1]. Vitanzo contended the writ's lifetime was 60 days from its *issuance*, and the levy occurred five months after issuance [2]. The CFI dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, ruling the levy was valid [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the sheriff's levy was validly made within the lifetime of the writ of execution.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The levy was valid. Under Section 11, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, the writ of execution may be made returnable at any time not less than 10 nor more than 60 days *after its receipt by the officer* [4, 5]. The lifetime of the writ is not calculated from its issuance date, but includes the period up to the return day, which is a maximum of 60 days from the sheriff's receipt of the writ [4].

In this case, the Sheriff received the writ on July 7, 1962, and levied on the property on the very same day. Thus, the levy was properly made within the lifetime of the writ [6]. Furthermore, the fact that the auction sale took place on March 16, 1963—long after the 60-day return period—does not affect the validity of the sale. As held in *Government v. Echaus*, a valid levy made within the period provided by law may be enforced by a sale thereafter, as the sale is simply the carrying out of the writ and levy [6].

The order of dismissal is AFFIRMED [6].
