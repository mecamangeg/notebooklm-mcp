I. CAPTION
NORBERTO DE LA REA v. HON. ABELARDO SUBIDO and HON. JOSE D. CALDERON, G.R. No. L-26082, November 29, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner De la Rea, originally the Auditor of Pasay City, was appointed as Auditor of the National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO). Respondent Civil Service Commissioner Subido disapproved this appointment. De la Rea challenged the disapproval and continued acting as NAMARCO Auditor, involving himself in a legal conflict between the Auditor General and the Civil Service Commissioner. The Supreme Court previously ruled that upon the disapproval of his NAMARCO appointment, De la Rea was deemed reverted to his former position as Pasay City Auditor.

De la Rea filed a motion seeking clarification and reconsideration, claiming entitlement to: (1) salary increases corresponding to the hike in the NAMARCO Assistant General Manager's pay; and (2) back salaries for the period he was out of service. Respondents opposed, arguing that De la Rea had abandoned his Pasay City post by refusing to return immediately after the Commissioner disapproved his promotion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the salary increase of the NAMARCO Assistant General Manager automatically increases the salary of the NAMARCO Auditor.
2. W/N De la Rea is entitled to back salaries for the period he was out of service.
3. W/N De la Rea abandoned his former position as Auditor of Pasay City.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the increase, by law or otherwise, of the annual salary of the Assistant General Manager of NAMARCO did not automatically and correspondingly increase that of its Auditor. To be entitled to the increase, there was a need for a new appointment (promotional as to salary) fixing the compensation at the increased rate. The Court relied on the ruling in *Genato v. Sychangco* (G.R. No. L-23095, May 12, 1967).

2. **NO.** Compensation for services not actually rendered is not the rule. The Court found that the respondents did not act in bad faith or illegally; they merely acted upon the decisions of the Civil Service Commissioner, which are presumed valid until reversed. Since De la Rea chose to litigate his right to the NAMARCO position, he must bear the consequences of his stand. Even broad principles of equity do not justify his claim for back pay.

3. **NO.** Abandonment of public office requires clear and strong proof. The Court ruled that De la Rea did not abandon his Pasay City post; his continued stay at NAMARCO was justified by the pending legal proceedings regarding the validity of the Commissioner's ruling. Consequently, he is reverted to his position as Pasay City Auditor. The Court noted that any persons appointed to the Pasay position *pendente lite* are charged with knowledge of the pending case and are bound by the result.

The motions were **DENIED**.
