I. CAPTION
**ANTONIO J. VILLEGAS, et al. v. ABELARDO SUBIDO, et al.**, G.R. No. L-29588, December 27, 1968, 26 SCRA 531, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
Pursuant to Republic Act No. 5185 (Decentralization Act of 1967), the City of Manila created the position of City Legal Officer. On January 23, 1968, Petitioner Mayor Villegas appointed Gregorio A. Ejercito to the position and submitted the appointment *directly* to the Civil Service Commission (CSC), bypassing attestation by the City Treasurer due to a previous arrangement. After more than six months without action, Mayor Villegas demanded the release of the appointment, invoking Section 20 of Republic Act No. 2260 (Civil Service Act of 1959), which provides that appointments not acted upon within 180 days are deemed properly made. Respondent CSC Commissioner Subido disapproved the appointment on October 1, 1968, ruling that Section 20 did not apply to directly submitted appointments and that Ejercito failed to meet the qualification standard of "four years experience in trial work." Petitioners filed a special civil action for Mandamus to compel the approval.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Section 20 of R.A. 2260 (automatic approval after 180 days) applies to appointments submitted directly to the Civil Service Commission.
2. W/N the appointee Ejercito is qualified for the position of City Legal Officer.
3. W/N Mandamus lies to compel the Commissioner to approve the appointment.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Section 20 of R.A. 2260 contemplates a situation where an appointment is attested by the City Treasurer in his capacity as a deputy of the Commissioner of Civil Service. Since Ejercito's appointment was submitted directly to the Commissioner and not attested by the Treasurer, the specific statutory provision for automatic approval after 180 days does not apply by analogy. The previous arrangement regarding direct submission did not equate to attestation.

2. **YES.** The Court found that Ejercito met the qualification standards, including the disputed "four years experience in trial work." A certification from the Clerk of Court showing Ejercito’s appearance in 18 civil cases, combined with his 22 years of legal and administrative service to the City, sufficiently established his competence and experience.

3. **YES.** Although Section 20 of R.A. 2260 does not strictly apply, **public policy and public interest demand that the Commissioner take action within a reasonable time of 180 days** from the receipt of appointments directly submitted to him. Since the appointee is qualified and the appointment was received on January 26, 1968, the Commissioner had a duty to approve it once the reasonable period elapsed. Citing *Villanueva v. Balallo*, the Court held that when an appointee is admitted qualified, the Commissioner has no choice but to attest to the appointment.

**Petition granted.** The Commissioner is commanded to approve Ejercito’s appointment and act on the staff appointments.
