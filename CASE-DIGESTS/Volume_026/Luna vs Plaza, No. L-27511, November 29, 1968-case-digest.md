I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS, SIMON LUNA v. HON. LORENZO M. PLAZA, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-27511, November 29, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
A criminal complaint for murder was filed against petitioner Simon Luna by T-Sgt. Patosa in the Municipal Court of Tandag, Surigao del Sur. Supporting the complaint were sworn statements of witnesses in question-and-answer form taken by the investigator [1]. Respondent Judge Lorenzo Plaza personally examined the witnesses by reading the questions and answers from their affidavits, verifying their truthfulness under oath, and adopting the investigator's questions as his own "searching questions" [1, 2].

Judge Plaza issued a warrant of arrest, and Luna was detained [3]. Luna subsequently waived his right to preliminary investigation and filed a petition for bail, which was initially granted but later revoked [3, 4]. Luna then filed a petition for *habeas corpus* with the Court of First Instance (CFI), arguing that his detention was illegal because the Judge failed to strictly comply with Republic Act No. 3828, which requires the judge to personally examine witnesses with searching questions reduced to writing [4, 5]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the Judge substantially complied with the law [6]. Luna appealed directly to the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the warrant of arrest was validly issued in compliance with Republic Act No. 3828 despite the Judge adopting the questions of the investigator.
2. W/N the petitioner waived the right to question the irregularity of the arrest.
3. W/N *habeas corpus* is the proper remedy.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the requirements of Republic Act No. 3828—(1) personal examination, (2) under oath, and (3) reduced to writing in the form of searching questions and answers—were fulfilled [8]. The law does not prohibit a Municipal Judge from adopting questions asked by a previous investigator, provided the Judge is satisfied they are "searching questions" that tend to show the commission of a crime and the perpetrator [9, 10]. In this case, the Judge personally examined the witnesses under oath by reviewing the previous questions and answers with them, and these were in writing and sworn to before him [9, 11].

2. **YES.** The petitioner waived the preliminary investigation and applied for bail. These acts subsequent to the arrest constitute an implied admission of probable cause and a waiver of any irregularity that may have attended the issuance of the warrant of arrest, citing *Doce v. Branch II of the CFI of Quezon* [12, 13].

3. **NO.** Under Section 4, Rule 102 of the Rules of Court, the writ of *habeas corpus* shall not be allowed if the person alleged to be restrained is in the custody of an officer under process issued by a court or judge having jurisdiction [14]. Since the Municipal Judge had jurisdiction to issue the warrant, and the warrant was found to be valid, the writ cannot be granted. The proper remedy would have been a motion to quash the warrant or a petition for reinvestigation [15].

The decision of the trial court is **AFFIRMED** [16].
