I. CAPTION
MUNICIPALITY (NOW CITY) OF LEGASPI v. A. L. AMMEN TRANSPORTATION CO., INC., G.R. No. L-22377, November 29, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent A. L. Ammen Transportation Co., Inc. (ALATCO) filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Albay to recover possession of a parcel of land (Lot No. 1114) against the Province of Albay, the Municipality (now City) of Legaspi, and private individuals. Prior to this, ALATCO successfully petitioned for the judicial reconstitution of its Transfer Certificate of Title covering said lot. Despite the reconstitution, the City of Legaspi refused to surrender possession, arguing that the land had been converted into a public road (Quezon Avenue) since 1947 and was vital to local commerce.

The CFI dismissed ALATCO’s complaint. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the CFI, declaring ALATCO the registered owner based on the valid reconstituted title. The CA ordered the City to pay rentals and granted it a period of one year to expropriate the portion occupied by the road; otherwise, it must return the land to ALATCO. The City filed a petition for review on certiorari.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the judicial reconstitution of respondent's title was valid despite the alleged lack of individual notice to the petitioner.
2. W/N the registered owner can enforce the return of possession of land that has been converted into and used as a public road.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A judicially reconstituted certificate of title has the same validity and legal effect as the original thereof under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 26 [1]. Proceedings for judicial reconstitution are *in rem*; thus, no individual notice to specific persons is required for the court to acquire jurisdiction [2]. Jurisdiction is acquired upon compliance with the posting of notices and publication in the Official Gazette. Failure to send notice to the City did not amount to a jurisdictional defect [3].

2. **NO.** While the respondent, as the registered owner, technically has the right to recover possession as an attribute of ownership, restoration of possession is "neither convenient nor feasible" because the property is now used for road purposes [4]. Citing *Alfonso v. Pasay City* (106 Phil. 1017), the Court held that when registered land has been converted into a public road, the appropriate relief is for the government to make due compensation to the owner [4]. Consequently, the Court affirmed the CA decision which gave the City of Legaspi a period of one year to expropriate the portion occupied by the road if it does not wish to return the property [5, 6].

**WHEREFORE**, the appealed decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
