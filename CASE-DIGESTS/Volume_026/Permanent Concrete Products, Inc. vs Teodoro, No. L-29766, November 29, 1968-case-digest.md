I. CAPTION
PERMANENT CONCRETE PRODUCTS, INC. v. DONATO TEODORO and CLEMENTINA VDA. DE GUISON, G.R. No. L-29766, November 29, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant Clementina Vda. de Guison hired contractor Teodoro & Associates to construct a building for a lump sum of P44,000. The contract explicitly stated that the contractor would supply all labor and materials. During construction, the contractor ordered hollow blocks worth P759.88 from plaintiff Permanent Concrete Products, Inc. but refused to pay, claiming Guison was liable.

The plaintiff sued both parties in the City Court of Manila, which ruled against Guison. Guison appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. At the CFI pre-trial conference, the parties agreed to limit the legal issues to three specific points, none of which questioned defendant Donato Teodoro's participation in the transaction. The CFI rendered judgment ordering Teodoro to pay the plaintiff. Teodoro appealed, arguing that there was no evidence linking him to the transaction and that the owner, Guison, should be liable.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellant can raise the defense of his non-participation in the transaction on appeal despite not raising it during the pre-trial conference.
2. W/N the owner of the building is liable for the cost of materials ordered by the contractor.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The appellant is bound by the delimitation of issues agreed upon during the pre-trial conference. The Court held that one of the objectives of pre-trial procedure is to remove the element of surprise and maneuvering [1]. The failure to disclose the defense of non-participation at the pre-trial stage waived the appellant's right to raise it later, as the pre-trial order controls the subsequent course of the action [2]. Furthermore, the record revealed circumstances—such as sharing an address with "Teodoro & Associates" and representation by the same counsel—that negatived his contention of non-connection [3].

2. **NO.** The contractor is liable because he expressly assumed the obligation to supply all labor and materials in the construction contract for a lump sum [4]. Although the installation of materials benefited Guison, she was not unjustly enriched because she was bound to pay the agreed contract price of P44,000. In the absence of proof that she failed to pay the contractor, the contractor is legally obliged to fulfill the undertaking to furnish all materials [5].

The judgment appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
