I. CAPTION
EUSEBIO VILLANUEVA, ET AL. v. CITY OF ILOILO, G.R. No. L-26521, December 28, 1968, 26 SCRA 578, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On January 15, 1960, the Municipal Board of Iloilo City enacted Ordinance No. 11, Series of 1960, imposing a "municipal license tax" on persons engaged in the business of operating tenement houses. This was enacted pursuant to Republic Act No. 2264 (Local Autonomy Act), following a previous Supreme Court decision (*City of Iloilo v. Villanueva*, L-12695) which declared a similar 1946 ordinance *ultra vires* for lack of authority under the City Charter.

Eusebio Villanueva and other owners of tenement houses in Iloilo City challenged the validity of Ordinance No. 11. They argued that the tax was a "real estate tax" beyond the City's power to impose, constituted double taxation as they already paid real estate taxes, was oppressive, and violated the rule of uniformity of taxation. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo declared the ordinance illegal, ruling that it was beyond the City's powers, oppressive due to its penal clause, and constituted double taxation. The City of Iloilo appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City of Iloilo is empowered to impose the tenement tax under the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. No. 2264).
2. W/N the ordinance constitutes prohibited double taxation.
3. W/N the ordinance violates the rule of uniformity of taxation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Local Autonomy Act grants local governments broad taxing authority extending to almost everything, except those specifically mentioned in Section 2 of the Act. The tax in question is not a real estate tax, but a license tax on the business or occupation of operating tenement houses [1, 2]. Unlike a real estate tax, it is not based on the assessed value of the property, does not require assessors, and is not a lien on the land [2]. Since it does not fall under the exceptions in Section 2 of R.A. No. 2264, the City has the authority to impose it [3].

2. **NO.** There is no double taxation in the objectionable sense because the two taxes are not of the same kind or character. The real estate tax is a tax on ownership of property, while the ordinance imposes a license tax on the business or calling of operating tenement houses [2, 4]. The State may collect an *ad valorem* tax on property used in a calling and simultaneously impose a license tax on that calling [5]. Furthermore, there is no constitutional prohibition against double taxation in the Philippines; it is permissible provided it does not violate other constitutional requirements like uniformity [6].

3. **NO.** Tenement houses constitute a distinct class of property and business enterprise, separate from hotels or lodging houses [7]. The rule of uniformity constitutes that all property of the same class within the taxing authority be taxed equally. The fact that owners of other classes of buildings do not pay this specific tax does not violate uniformity, as the burden falls equally on all tenement house owners similarly situated [8, 9].

ACCORDINGLY, the judgment *a quo* is reversed, and, the ordinance in question being valid, the complaint is hereby dismissed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
