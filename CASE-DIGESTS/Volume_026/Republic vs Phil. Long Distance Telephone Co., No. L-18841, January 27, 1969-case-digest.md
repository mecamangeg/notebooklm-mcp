I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PHILIPPINE LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE COMPANY, G.R. No. L-18841, January 27, 1969, 26 SCRA 620, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
The Bureau of Telecommunications (Bureau) was created in 1947 under Executive Order No. 94 to operate the Government Telephone System (GTS). The Bureau rented trunk lines from the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) to enable government offices to call private parties. However, the Bureau eventually extended its services to the general public using these trunk lines, in competition with PLDT. PLDT complained that this violated the conditions of their Private Branch Exchange (PBX) agreement, which limited the service to government use, and subsequently disconnected the trunk lines, isolating the Philippines from most international telephone services.

The Republic filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to compel PLDT to execute a contract for the use of its facilities and to enjoin the disconnection. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that it could not coerce PLDT to enter into a contract when the parties could not agree on terms, but it made the preliminary injunction permanent to prevent public prejudice. Both parties appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the court can compel the parties to enter into a contract for interconnection.
2. W/N the Republic can require PLDT to permit interconnection between the GTS and PLDT’s system.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The parties cannot be coerced to enter into a contract where no agreement is had between them as to the principal terms and conditions. Freedom to stipulate such terms is of the essence of the contractual system, and a contract may be annulled if tainted by violence, intimidation, or undue influence (Articles 1306, 1336, 1337, Civil Code).

2. **YES.** While the Republic may not compel PLDT to celebrate a contract, it may, in the exercise of the sovereign power of **eminent domain**, require the telephone company to permit interconnection of the government telephone system and that of PLDT, subject to the payment of **just compensation**. The power of eminent domain is not limited to the taking of title or possession but may be availed of to impose a burden, such as an easement of right of way, upon the owner of the condemned property for public use. The High Court held that the use of PLDT’s lines to allow inter-service connection is a burden for public benefit, similar to an easement. The CFI should have treated the case as one of condemnation proceedings rather than dismissing it.

**Disposition:** The decision of the Court of First Instance is AFFIRMED, except insofar as it dismissed the petition to compel service. The records are REMANDED to the court of origin for the determination of just compensation and further proceedings.
