I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE AMERICAN EMBROIDERIES, INC., ALBERT NASSER and JACK NASSER v. EMBROIDERY & GARMENT WORKERS UNION, G.R. No. L-20143, January 27, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Philippine American Embroideries, Inc., managed by the Nasser brothers, operated a machine-made department for scalloping handkerchiefs [1, 2]. Since 1956, the company practiced laying off employees who failed to meet quotas [3]. The department suffered continued financial losses amounting to over P108,000 from 1957 to 1958 [4]. To avoid total collapse, management warned employees of potential closure [4].

In October 1958, employees organized the respondent Embroidery & Garment Workers Union to prevent their lay-off [3, 5]. On November 3, 1958, the union submitted collective bargaining proposals [6]. That same afternoon, the company announced the closure of the Machine Made Department and the opening of a Knitting Gloves Department, advising dismissed employees to file applications for the new department [6, 7]. The company's machines were transferred to provinces and leased to independent contractors [7, 8].

The union filed a complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP). The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) Trial Judge dismissed the complaint, finding the closure justified by losses [9]. However, the CIR *en banc* reversed this, ruling the petitioners guilty of ULP for interfering with union rights and discrimination, and ordered the reinstatement of the dismissed members [10]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners are guilty of unfair labor practice for closing the department and dismissing the union members.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CIR *en banc* resolution. The Court held that the closure of the department was not an act of discrimination or dismissal for union activities but the result of continued losses in operations, a ground entirely justified by law [11].

The evidence showed the department had been suffering financial reverses for two years, and the decision to close was not sudden [5]. The union was organized specifically to prevent lay-offs due to the impending cessation of work [5]. Furthermore, the company did not refuse to bargain; it merely requested proof of majority representation and certification from the CIR, which was the proper legal procedure given an existing agreement with another union [12]. The transfer of machines to independent contractors did not negate the bona fide nature of the closure [8]. Since the closure was for a legitimate business reason, there was no ULP [11].

The Resolution appealed from is **REVERSED** and **SET ASIDE**, and the complaint is **DISMISSED** [11].
