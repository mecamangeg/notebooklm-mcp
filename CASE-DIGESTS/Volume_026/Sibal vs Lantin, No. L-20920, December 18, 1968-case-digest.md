I. CAPTION
RESTITUTO M. SIBAL v. GREGORIO T. LANTIN, in his capacity as Presiding Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch VII, THE SPOUSES LORENZO & INOCENCIA VALDEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20920, December 18, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Restituto Sibal and Mariano Guison, owner of the Angela Building, executed a lease contract and a "Contract of Transfer of Management" regarding the building spaces previously occupied by Valleson, Inc. [1, 2]. Following this, Sibal filed unlawful detainer cases in the Municipal Court of Manila against various sublessees (respondents) who refused to vacate [3]. The sublessees moved to dismiss the ejectment cases, arguing that a pending case in the Court of First Instance (CFI Case No. 51476) involving the alleged lease rights of Valleson, Inc. constituted a prejudicial question, but the Municipal Court Judge (Judge Cornejo) denied the motions [4].

Consequently, the sublessees filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition (CFI Case No. 52866) with the CFI of Manila against Sibal and Judge Cornejo [5]. Respondent Judge Lantin, presiding over the CFI, issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the Municipal Court from proceeding with the hearing of the ejectment cases [5, 6]. Sibal filed this petition to annul Judge Lantin's order [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent Judge Lantin committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain the Municipal Court from hearing the ejectment cases.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that Judge Lantin committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction [8, 9].

Under Section 3 of Rule 58 of the Rules of Court, a prerequisite for the issuance of a preliminary injunction is that "the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded" [8, 10]. The relief sought by the sublessees in the CFI was a writ of certiorari or prohibition, which can only be granted if the respondent judge acted without or in excess of jurisdiction [10, 11]. Unlawful detainer cases fall within the **exclusive original jurisdiction** of the municipal court under Section 88 of the Judiciary Act of 1948 (Rep. Act No. 296), giving Judge Cornejo the specific authority and duty to hear them [11].

The Court rejected the sublessees' contention that the pending CFI case regarding the lease ownership (Valleson vs. Sibal) was a prejudicial question [12]. The Court held that: (1) the sublessees were not parties to the pending CFI case; (2) the issue in the CFI case was the lease, while the ejectment cases concerned the subleases; (3) the decision in the CFI case would not bind the sublessees; and (4) Sibal's right to eject did not necessarily depend on his being the lessee of the owner, as even a usurper may eject a sub-possessor [12-14]. Since the Municipal Court had exclusive jurisdiction and committed no abuse of discretion, the sublessees were not entitled to the writ, and the issuance of the injunction by Judge Lantin was improper [9].

The writ and order of January 31, 1963, are declared null and void *ab initio*, and the petition is granted [15].
