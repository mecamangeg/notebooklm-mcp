I. CAPTION
Renato D. Tayag, Ancillary Administrator of the Testate Estate of Idonah Slade Perkins v. Benguet Consolidated, Inc., G.R. No. L-23145, November 29, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Idonah Slade Perkins died in New York, leaving behind stock certificates covering 33,002 shares of Benguet Consolidated, Inc., a Philippine corporation. The certificates were in the possession of County Trust Company of New York, the domiciliary administrator. Renato D. Tayag, the ancillary administrator in the Philippines, needed the shares to settle the estate and satisfy local creditors. However, the domiciliary administrator refused to deliver the certificates despite an order from the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. Consequently, the CFI issued an order considering the certificates as "lost" for all purposes of administration, cancelling the old certificates, and directing Benguet Consolidated to issue new ones to Tayag. Benguet Consolidated appealed, arguing that the certificates were not physically lost but were known to exist in New York, and that complying with the order would violate its by-laws regarding lost certificates.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the court may consider stock certificates "lost" and order the issuance of new ones when the certificates physically exist but are withheld by a foreign domiciliary administrator.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. An ancillary administrator has the inherent power and duty to gain control of the decedent's assets within the Philippines to satisfy the claims of local creditors [1], pursuant to Rule 84, Section 3 of the Rules of Court. While the certificates were not physically lost, the domiciliary administrator's persistent refusal to surrender them constituted a "loss" for the purposes of administration [2]. The Court applied a necessary legal fiction; otherwise, a valid judicial order would be rendered nugatory by the defiance of a foreign entity [3]. Furthermore, Benguet Consolidated, as a corporation created by Philippine law (Act No. 1459), owes its existence to the State and cannot refuse to obey a lawful court order by invoking its corporate by-laws [4, 5]. A corporation's internal rules cannot supersede judicial authority [4].

The appealed order of the Court of First Instance is affirmed.
