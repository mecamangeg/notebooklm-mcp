I. CAPTION
ILLUH ASAALI, et al. v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-24170, December 16, 1968, 26 SCRA 383, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were owners of five sailing vessels (kumpits) of Philippine registry. On September 10, 1950, a customs patrol team intercepted these vessels on the high seas, specifically between British North Borneo and Sulu, while they were heading toward Tawi-tawi. Upon inspection, the vessels were found laden with cases of foreign cigarettes and rattan chairs. The vessels did not possess the required permit from the Commissioner of Customs to engage in importation into the Sulu sea, and the cargoes lacked import licenses required by the Import Control Law (Republic Act No. 426). The Collector of Customs of Jolo declared the forfeiture of the vessels and cargo. This decision was affirmed by the Commissioner of Customs and the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). Petitioners appealed, arguing primarily that the seizure was invalid because it occurred outside Philippine territorial waters.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the seizure of the vessels and cargo on the high seas was valid.
2. W/N the expiration of the Import Control Law abated the liability of the petitioners.
3. W/N the petitioners were denied due process.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The seizure was valid. The Supreme Court ruled that a state has the right to protect itself and its revenues, a right which extends to the high seas under settled doctrines of International Law (*Church v. Hubbart*). Furthermore, the vessels were of Philippine registry, and under Article 2 of the Revised Penal Code, the law is enforceable against those committing offenses while on a Philippine ship. The facts clearly showed the vessels came from a foreign port (Sandakan) and were heading toward a domestic port (Tawi-tawi) with prohibited goods, violating Section 1363(a) of the Revised Administrative Code.

2. **NO.** The liability was not abated. Citing *Roxas v. Sayoc* and *Golay-Buchel & Cie v. Commissioner of Customs*, the Court held that the expiration of the Import Control Law (R.A. No. 650/426) did not legalize importations that were illegal when made, nor did it divest the Commissioner of Customs of jurisdiction acquired while the law was in force. Forfeiture cases are proceedings *in rem*, and jurisdiction is retained until final determination.

3. **NO.** There was no denial of due process. The Court found the vessels and merchandise were clearly subject to forfeiture under Section 1363(a) and (f) of the Revised Administrative Code. There was nothing arbitrary in the manner of seizure, and the petitioners' right to a hearing was respected. The Court emphasized that due process cannot be used as an instrument to escape liability arising from one's own "nefarious acts."

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed.
