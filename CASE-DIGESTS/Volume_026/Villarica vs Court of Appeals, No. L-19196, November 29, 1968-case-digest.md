I. CAPTION
ANGEL VILLARICA and NIEVES PALMA GIL DE VILLARICA v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, JULIANA MONTEVERDE, GAUDENCIO CONSUNJI and JOVITO S. FRANCISCO, G.R. No. L-19196, November 29, 1968, Capistrano, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On May 19, 1951, petitioners Spouses Villarica sold a lot in Davao City to respondents Spouses Consunji for P35,000 through a public instrument of absolute sale (Exh. "B") [2]. On May 25, 1951, the Consunjis executed a separate public instrument (Exh. "D") granting the Villaricas an option to buy the same property within one year for P37,750 [2]. The Consunjis registered the sale and obtained a new transfer certificate of title [2]. Later, in February 1953, the Consunjis sold the property to respondent Jovito S. Francisco [2]. On April 14, 1953, the Villaricas filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Davao for the reformation of the instrument of absolute sale into an equitable mortgage, claiming it was intended to secure a usurious loan [3]. The trial court ruled in favor of the petitioners, reforming the deed into an equitable mortgage [3]. The Court of Appeals reversed this decision, finding that the deed expressed the true intention of the parties as an absolute sale [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the instrument of absolute sale (Exh. "B") constitutes an equitable mortgage. [4]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' finding that the instrument was one of absolute sale and not an equitable mortgage [5]. The presumption of equitable mortgage under Article 1602 of the Civil Code did not apply for the following reasons:

1.  **Price:** The price of P35,000 was not inadequate; the petitioners had purchased the lot for only P20,000 a year earlier and made a profit, and P35,000 was the market value at the time of the sale [6].
2.  **Possession:** The vendors did not remain in possession of the land as lessees or otherwise [7].
3.  **Taxes:** The taxes paid by the vendors were back taxes accrued up to the time of the sale, which they were obligated to pay to sell the land free of liens [8].
4.  **Right of Repurchase vs. Option to Buy:** The Court held that the "right of repurchase" (conventional redemption) must be reserved by the vendor in the *same* instrument of sale under Article 1601 of the Civil Code [9]. Since the option to buy (Exh. "D") was granted in a separate instrument, it was not a right of repurchase but a distinct "option to buy" [9]. Consequently, the extension of the option period did not trigger the presumption under Article 1602(3) regarding the extension of a redemption period [9].

Petition denied. Judgment affirmed. [5]

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Concepcion, C.J., and Reyes, J.B.L., J., concurred in the result [5].
