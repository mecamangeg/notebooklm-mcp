I. CAPTION
OCTAVIO INFANTADO v. FELIPE LIWANAG and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-23697, December 28, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Infantado was the defendant in a civil case at the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, while respondent Liwanag was the plaintiff. The CFI rendered judgment dismissing Liwanag's complaint [1]. Liwanag appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), but failed to file his appellant's brief within the 45-day reglementary period, which expired on July 26, 1963 [1]. Consequently, the CA issued a resolution dismissing the appeal, which Liwanag received on August 26, 1963 [2, 3].

On August 27, 1963, Liwanag filed a motion for reconsideration [2]. The CA granted the motion, reinstated the appeal, and gave Liwanag a new period of 25 days to file his brief [2, 4]. Infantado did not question this at the time and filed his own brief [4]. Subsequently, on September 11, 1964, the CA rendered a decision reversing the CFI's judgment on the merits [5]. Infantado then filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the CA had already lost jurisdiction over the case when the original period to file the brief expired [5]. The CA denied the motion, prompting Infantado to file a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals lost jurisdiction over the appeal upon the expiration of the period to file the appellant's brief.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the mere lapse of the period to file the appellant's brief does not automatically result in the dismissal of the appeal and the loss of jurisdiction by the appellate court [6, 7]. After the expiration of the period, the appellate court must still act—either by ordering the dismissal upon motion or *motu proprio* [7, 8]. Even after an order of dismissal, the affected party retains the right to file a motion for reconsideration within fifteen days from notice [7, 8].

In this case, Liwanag filed his motion for reconsideration on August 27, 1963, just one day after receiving the notice of dismissal on August 26, 1963 [2, 3]. Since the motion was timely, the CA retained jurisdiction to reconsider its resolution and reinstate the appeal [3]. The Court emphasized that it is within the inherent power and discretion of the CA to amend its orders to render substantial justice, citing Section 5(g), Rule 135 of the Rules of Court and *Veluz v. Justice of the Peace of Sariaya* [2, 3]. The petition was dismissed [9].
