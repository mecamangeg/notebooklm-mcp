I. CAPTION
N. M. BALUYOT & CO. v. ANTONIO TY, HON. FELIX DOMINGO, Presiding Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch XV, and UNION TEXTILE CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-29905, December 24, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Antonio Ty and Union Textile Corporation (UTC) had a textile supply agreement. Upon its expiration, Petitioner N. M. Baluyot & Co. offered a sole buyership contract which UTC accepted. Ty filed Civil Case No. 73189 to enjoin this, obtaining a preliminary injunction. Baluyot intervened and petitioned the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 41449-R), which issued a writ restraining the enforcement of said injunction. Subsequently, Ty filed a second action (Civil Case No. 73530) for specific performance and damages before Respondent Judge Domingo, alleging short deliveries. Judge Domingo issued a restraining order preventing UTC from selling to others. Hearings on the preliminary injunction were repeatedly postponed at Ty's instance. Judge Domingo eventually ordered the injunction hearing to be held simultaneously with the trial on the merits, effectively maintaining the restraining order indefinitely without bond. Baluyot filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus directly with the Supreme Court, alleging grave abuse of discretion.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court should entertain the petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus despite the concurrent jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court declined to entertain the petition directly in adherence to established policy. Although the Court has original jurisdiction to entertain special civil actions for certiorari, prohibition, or mandamus (as the Court of Appeals' jurisdiction is not exclusive), the consistent policy is to require such petitions to be filed with the Court of Appeals when they are in aid of its appellate jurisdiction.

The Court observed that the facts clearly demonstrated arbitrariness and grave abuse of discretion by the respondent judge [1]—specifically by issuing a restraining order without bond that circumvented a standing injunction from the Court of Appeals, and by delaying the hearing to maintain the order indefinitely [1, 2]. However, under Section 29 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, the writs prayed for are in aid of the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals over the main case [3]. Citing *Breslin v. Luzon Stevedoring Company*, the Court held that petitions of this nature should be filed with the Court of Appeals, with the Supreme Court reserving its power to review the final judgments rendered therein [3, 4].

The case was **DISMISSED** without prejudice to filing the corresponding petition with the Court of Appeals [5, 6].
