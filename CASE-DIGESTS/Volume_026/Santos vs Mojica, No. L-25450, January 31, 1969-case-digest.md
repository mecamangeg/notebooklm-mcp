I. CAPTION
LEONARDO SANTOS v. HON. ANGEL H. MOJICA, THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF of Rizal, and TEODORICO ALLANIGUE, et al., G.R. No. L-25450, January 31, 1969, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondents, the Allanigue siblings, filed Civil Case No. 217-R against the parents of petitioner Leonardo Santos. The parents were summoned in 1959, and a judgment was subsequently rendered against them. Petitioner Leonardo Santos claimed ownership of the house and the portion of the lot where it stood, alleging he purchased it from his parents. However, records showed he reconstructed his house into a bigger one after March 1962, well after his parents had been summoned.

Leonardo and his parents previously filed a petition for certiorari (G.R. No. L-19618) challenging the lower court's jurisdiction to order demolition. The Supreme Court denied this petition on February 28, 1964, ruling that Leonardo should have filed a separate civil action to vindicate his ownership. After this decision became final, respondent Judge Angel H. Mojica, upon motion of the Allanigues, ordered the demolition of the houses on the lot. Other defendants complied, but Leonardo did not. On December 9, 1965, Judge Mojica issued an order directing the sheriff to demolish Leonardo’s house. Leonardo filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition questioning the jurisdiction of the respondent Judge and the validity of the demolition order.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the present petition is barred by *res judicata* due to the prior judgment in G.R. No. L-19618.
2. W/N the petitioner is bound by the judgment in the main civil case against his parents.
3. W/N the petitioner is a builder in bad faith and the order of demolition is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The petition is barred by the prior judgment in G.R. No. L-19618. The Court found identity of parties (Leonardo was a petitioner in the previous case against the same respondents), identity of subject matter (the portion of the lot and the house), and identity of cause of action (the validity of the order of demolition). The previous decision was on the merits and had become final, constituting *res judicata* on the validity of the demolition order.

2. **YES.** A final judgment is binding not only against the parties but also against their successors-in-interest. Leonardo Santos is the son of the defendants in Civil Case No. 217-R and claims the property under them. The Court ruled that the registration of the sale from his parents to him is of no moment because, as a successor-in-interest, he is bound by the judgment rendered against his predecessors.

3. **YES.** Leonardo Santos is deemed a builder in bad faith because he built and reconstructed his house into a bigger one after his parents (predecessors-in-interest) had already been summoned in 1959. Under **Article 449 of the Civil Code**, a builder in bad faith loses what is built without right to indemnity. Consequently, under **Article 450 of the Civil Code**, the owners of the land (the Allanigues) validly exercised their option to demand the demolition of the work at the expense of the builder.

The petition is **DENIED**, with treble costs against the petitioner. The writ of preliminary injunction is dissolved.
