I. CAPTION
EDUARDO J. BERENGUER v. PEDRO B. CARRANZA, Adm. Case No. 716, January 30, 1969, 26 SCRA 673, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Eduardo Berenguer filed an administrative case against respondent lawyer Pedro Carranza for deception practiced on the Court of First Instance of Sorsogon. Carranza introduced an "Affidavit of Adjudication and Transfer" in a cadastral case, executed by the mother of his client [1]. The affidavit falsely stated that the affiant left no legitimate heirs except herself, when in fact she was survived by four other daughters and a son (the complainant's father) [1]. Carranza admitted presenting the evidence but claimed he had no hand in preparing the documents (which were done in Pasay City) and was unaware of the falsity [2]. He argued he was not meticulous in checking the documents because there was no opposition to the petition [3], [4]. The Solicitor General found no evidence of deliberate deception but noted Carranza's lack of diligence, especially given his knowledge of existing family litigations involving successional rights [5], [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent lawyer is administratively liable for violation of his oath of office for submitting false evidence despite lack of intent to deceive.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that while the charge of deliberate deception could not be sustained due to lack of willful intent, the respondent is not exculpated from responsibility [7]. Every member of the bar must be on guard against oversight or inadvertence that could result in a failure of justice [8]. Lawyers are officers of the court held to strict accountability regarding candor and honesty; thus, even without intent to mislead, conduct betraying inattention or carelessness that causes confusion and prolongation of a suit violates the lawyer's oath [9], [10]. The Court cited *In re Rouss* and Section 3, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court requiring lawyers to do no falsehood nor consent to the doing of any in court [11].

Respondent Pedro B. Carranza is **REPRIMANDED** and warned that a repetition of the offense will be dealt with more severely [12].
