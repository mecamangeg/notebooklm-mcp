I. CAPTION
ALATCO TRANSPORTATION, INC., BICOL TRANSPORTATION CO., and CONSOLIDATED AUTO LINES, INC. v. ROSALIO S. BONETE, JR., G.R. No. L-25078, December 24, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Rosalio S. Bonete, Jr. applied for a certificate of public convenience to operate a PUB auto-truck service with four units on the Naga City-Legaspi City route. Petitioners, as affected operators, opposed the application. During the hearings, Bonete and a government auditor testified that despite existing operators, the current service was insufficient to cope with the public's needs [1]. Bonete also presented evidence of his financial capacity, including his salary as a salesman, unregistered real properties given by his father, a bank deposit, and ownership of trucks [2]. Petitioners' witness claimed their buses were not full, but the Public Service Commission (PSC) disbelieved him as he was petitioners' supervisor [3]. The PSC granted the application. Petitioners appealed, arguing the PSC abused its discretion in finding public necessity and financial qualification [4], relying on mathematical assumptions regarding costs to prove Bonete's insufficiency [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission erred in its findings of public necessity and the applicant's financial capacity.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision. The Court held that the credibility of witnesses in public service cases is not a proper subject for review by the Supreme Court, as doing so would convert the review into a trial *de novo* [6]. Regarding financial capacity, the Court ruled that this is essentially a finding of fact. Since the Commission's findings were supported by the record—noting Bonete already owned trucks and had other assets—they could not be declared patently unjustified [7]. The Court rejected petitioners' arguments based on "assumed probabilities" regarding unproven costs [7].

The decision of the Public Service Commission is **AFFIRMED** [8].
