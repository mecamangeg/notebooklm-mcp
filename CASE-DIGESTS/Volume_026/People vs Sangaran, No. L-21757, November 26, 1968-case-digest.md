**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. KASILA SANGARAN, G.R. No. L-21757, November 26, 1968, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
On June 1, 1959, in Bacolod, Lanao del Norte, Gregorio Lumacao was shot and killed inside his house while drinking water at the window [1, 2]. Shortly before the incident, his 15-year-old son, Victorio, saw the accused Kasila Sangaran (armed with a carbine) and one Rascal Tagua acting suspiciously near their house [1]. Tagua was initially charged but was acquitted in a separate trial [1, 3]. Sangaran was subsequently apprehended, tried, and found guilty of murder by the Court of First Instance, which sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* and ordered him to pay P6,000 in indemnity [3, 4]. Sangaran appealed, arguing that the evidence was insufficient and claiming that Tagua was the actual killer due to a prior grudge over a pig and a woman [5, 6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the trial court erred in giving full faith and credence to the testimony of prosecution witness Victorio Lumacao.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court relied on the established principle that the conclusions of the trial judge regarding the credibility of witnesses are entitled to full faith and credit, specifically noting the trial judge's observation of Victorio’s "demeanor and quick spontaneous answer[s]" [7, 8]. Furthermore, the Court found that Victorio had no apparent reason to falsely testify against the appellant [7, 9]. The appellant's defense trying to implicate Tagua was rejected because the alleged rivalry was not satisfactorily established, and evidence showed both men were together at the scene [9].

The Court affirmed the decision but increased the civil indemnity to P12,000.00, citing the leading case of *People v. Pantoja* [10].
