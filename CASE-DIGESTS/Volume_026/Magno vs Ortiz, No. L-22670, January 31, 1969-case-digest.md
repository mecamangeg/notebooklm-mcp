I. CAPTION
GUALBERTO V. MAGNO v. HON. MONTANO A. ORTIZ, THE CLERK OF COURT, THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF AGUSAN, and ROGACIANO SUAZO, G.R. No. L-22670, January 31, 1969, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On October 31, 1963, the Court of First Instance of Agusan rendered judgment in Civil Case No. 410 declaring plaintiff Rogaciano Suazo the owner of a parcel of land. Petitioner Gualberto V. Magno, an intervenor claiming the land, received a copy of the decision on December 12, 1963. On January 11, 1964, the thirtieth and last day of the reglementary period, Magno filed a motion for reconsideration by registered mail. However, the motion did not contain a notice of hearing.

On January 27, 1964, sixteen days after the period to appeal had expired, respondent Judge Ortiz *motu proprio* issued a notice setting the motion for hearing. Suazo moved for execution, arguing the judgment was already final. The trial court denied Magno's motion for reconsideration and granted the execution. Magno filed a petition for certiorari, contending that the lack of notice in his motion was cured by the court's subsequent issuance of a notice of hearing.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a motion for reconsideration filed without a notice of hearing suspends the running of the period for appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that a defective motion for reconsideration does not toll the running of the period of appeal.

The motion for reconsideration, which argued the decision was contrary to law, was effectively a motion for new trial under Rule 37. The applicable rules are Section 2 of Rule 37 in relation to Sections 4, 5, and 6 of Rule 15, which mandate that a written notice of the motion must be served by the movant on the adverse party. Without proof of such service, the court cannot act upon the motion. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Manila Surety & Fidelity Co., Inc. v. Batu Construction Co.* and *Fulton Insurance Co. v. Manila Railroad Co.*, stating that the duty to give notice devolves upon the movant, not the court.

The notice issued *motu proprio* by the respondent Judge did not cure the defect because Section 2 of Rule 37 repealed the old provision allowing court-served notice. Furthermore, even if the court had the authority, the notice was issued sixteen days after the thirty-day appeal period had already lapsed. Consequently, the judgment had become final and executory.

The petition is denied, and the preliminary injunction is lifted.
