**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. VICENTE OMPAD, ET AL., PASTOR LABUTIN, DOMINGO LABUTIN, and SANTIAGO RAYNADA, G.R. No. L-23513, January 31, 1969, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
On the evening of May 7, 1962, in Sta. Rita, Samar, Simplicio Tapulado and his common-law wife, Dominga del Monte, were in their farmhouse when Vicente Ompad called out to Simplicio to open the door. When Simplicio opened it, Ompad immediately shot and killed him. Angel Libre, standing beside Ompad, then shot and killed Dominga del Monte. Appellants Pastor Labutin, Domingo Labutin, and Santiago Raynada were present at the scene, stationed around the house. After the killing, Pastor Labutin remarked, "You Simplicio will not grab land anymore." The group then left.

The prosecution established that Pastor Labutin masterminded the plan to kill Simplicio due to a grudge, recruiting the others and supplying them with liquor and ammunition. The Court of First Instance of Samar convicted the appellants of double murder, sentencing Pastor Labutin to death and the others to *reclusion perpetua*. They appealed, raising the defense of alibi and questioning the discharge of co-accused Lucio Samar as a state witness.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the appellants are liable for the death of Dominga del Monte (scope of the conspiracy).
2. W/N the aggravating circumstances of nocturnity, abuse of superior strength, evident premeditation, and dwelling are present.
3. W/N the discharge of the co-defendant to become a state witness was reversible error.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The appellants are liable only for the death of Simplicio Tapulado. The rule is that co-conspirators are liable only for acts done pursuant to the conspiracy [1]. The evidence showed the conspiracy was directed solely against Simplicio ("You Simplicio will not grab land anymore") [2]. The killing of Dominga del Monte was not part of the plan and did not constitute a necessary consequence of the crime agreed upon; thus, only the actual perpetrator (Angel Libre) is liable for her death [3].

2. **YES** (as to Dwelling and Premeditation for Pastor) and **NO** (as to Nocturnity, Superior Strength, and Premeditation for others).
*   **Treachery:** Present. The attack was sudden and unexpected [4].
*   **Nocturnity:** Absent. The appellants did not purposely seek nighttime, and they identified themselves, negating furtiveness [4].
*   **Abuse of Superior Strength:** Absent. The superiority in numbers was not availed of nor did it enhance the crime [4].
*   **Evident Premeditation:** Present for Pastor Labutin, who planned the liquidation, supplied ammo, and stayed near the triggermen [5, 6]. Absent for Domingo and Santiago, as the time between the proposal and the crime (two hours) was insufficient for cool reflection, especially given their intoxication [7].
*   **Dwelling:** Present. Although the shots were fired from outside, the victims were attacked inside their own house [8, 9].

3. **NO.** The court may err in discharging a co-defendant, but such error is not reversible and does not affect the competency or quality of the discharged defendant's testimony (citing *People v. Jamero*) [10].

The judgment is **AFFIRMED** with modification. Appellants are found guilty of murder for the death of Simplicio Tapulado. The penalty for Pastor Labutin is reduced to *reclusion perpetua* for lack of sufficient votes for the death penalty. The indemnity is increased to P12,000 [11].
