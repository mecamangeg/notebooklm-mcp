I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO CRISOLOGO and CONSOLACION FLORENTINO CRISOLOGO v. ISAAC CENTENO and ASUNCION AQUINO CENTENO, G.R. No. L-20014, November 27, 1968, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
On January 18, 1955, petitioners filed an *ex parte* petition for consolidation of ownership in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur, claiming the respondents failed to repurchase two parcels of land sold with *pacto de retro*. The trial court granted the petition on January 28, 1955 [1]. Respondents later moved to set aside the order for lack of notice. After a series of motions and an appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) declared the January 28, 1955 order a patent nullity because the respondents had not been summoned, and remanded the case for proper proceedings [1]. Upon remand, respondents were duly summoned and alleged that the contracts were actually equitable mortgages securing usurious loans. The trial court ruled in favor of respondents, declaring the contracts as equitable mortgages and denying the consolidation of ownership [1-3]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law, arguing that the original January 28, 1955 order was valid and final [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for consolidation of ownership under Article 1607 of the Civil Code requires a contentious proceeding where the vendor is summoned and heard.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Article 1607 of the Civil Code provides that consolidation of ownership in the vendee shall not be recorded "without a judicial order, after the vendor has been duly heard." The Court held that this provision contemplates a **contentious proceeding** wherein the vendor *a retro* must be named as a respondent in the caption and title of the petition and must be duly summoned and heard [4].

In this case, the original petition named only the vendees as petitioners and failed to name the vendors as respondents or summon them. Consequently, the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over the persons of the vendors, rendering the January 28, 1955 order a patent nullity [5]. Furthermore, the CA's previous judgment setting aside the 1955 order is *res judicata* on the question of its nullity [5]. The proceedings taken after the remand, where the requirements of Article 1607 were met, were valid [6].

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [6].
