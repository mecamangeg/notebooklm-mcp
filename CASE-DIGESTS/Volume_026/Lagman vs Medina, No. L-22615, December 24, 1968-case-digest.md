I. CAPTION
BENEDICTO C. LAGMAN v. HON. ENRIQUE MEDINA, THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, et al., G.R. No. L-22615, December 24, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Public Service Commission (PSC) Commissioner Enrique Medina issued orders dated February 13, 1963, and subsequent amendments, banning provincial public utility buses from entering the City of Manila to minimize traffic congestion [1-3]. Operators were required to establish terminals outside the city limits (later extended to "Greater Manila") [1, 2]. Petitioner Lagman was granted a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) on March 20, 1963, to operate 15 buses on the Bocaue-Parañaque line via Manila [4]. When the ban was implemented in March 1964, Lagman filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition, arguing the ban was inapplicable to him as he was not an operator when the first order was issued, that he was not notified of hearings, and that the ban effectively amended his CPC without due process [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the PSC orders banning provincial buses from entering Manila are valid and applicable to the petitioner.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition. The Court held that the petitioner’s CPC, like all others, was issued subject to the condition that the operator shall comply with all rules and regulations of the Commission [7]. The contested orders were issued pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 17(a) of Commonwealth Act No. 146 (Public Service Act) and partake of the nature of such rules [7]. The Court rejected the theory that the orders constituted an amendment of the CPC requiring separate notice and hearing, ruling that this premise was false [8]. Furthermore, excluding the petitioner from the ban would defeat its purpose of minimizing traffic congestion [3]. The terms of the ban were substantially identical to a Manila ordinance previously upheld by the Court in *Lagman v. City of Manila* (G.R. No. L-23305) [6].

Petition dismissed and writs prayed for denied [8].
