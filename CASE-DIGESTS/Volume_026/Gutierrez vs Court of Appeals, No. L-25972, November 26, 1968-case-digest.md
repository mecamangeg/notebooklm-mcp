I. CAPTION
LEONARDO C. GUTIERREZ, et al. v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS and SILVESTRE D. FLORINDO, G.R. No. L-25972, November 26, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Florindo, a permanent market administrator, was appointed "Budget and Fiscal Officer" of Batangas with a higher salary. Despite the appointment, he received only his former salary. When he claimed the differential, Petitioner Provincial Treasurer Gutierrez denied it due to alleged lack of funds. Florindo filed a mandamus suit. Subsequently, the Provincial Board passed Resolution No. 872 abolishing Florindo's new position and reverting him to his old one.

The CFI nullified Resolution No. 872 but dismissed the mandamus for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the nullification of the resolution, reversed the dismissal of the mandamus (ordering payment of salary differentials), and held Gutierrez personally liable for damages.

Petitioners (sued in their official capacities) filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR), which the CA denied on March 22, 1966. Gutierrez, acting alone in his *private* capacity, filed a second MR solely regarding the personal damages awarded against him. The CA granted this second MR on April 23, 1966. Petitioners then filed the petition for review with the Supreme Court on April 29, 1966, arguing the period to appeal started from the resolution of the second MR.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for review was filed within the reglementary period.
2. W/N Florindo's failure to exhaust administrative remedies barred his action.
3. W/N the abolition of Florindo's position (Resolution No. 872) was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petition was filed late. The period to appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional. The petitioners' (official capacity) MR was denied on March 22, 1966, and they had 15 days from notice to appeal. Gutierrez's second MR was filed in his *private* capacity and limited to his personal liability for damages; it did not inure to the benefit of the petitioners in their *official* capacities regarding the main judgment (reinstatement and salary). As held in *Facundo v. Carbonnel*, where a decision makes independent rulings for different parties, an appeal by one does not obstacle the execution of the decision regarding the other. The judgment regarding the abolition of office and salary became final on April 9, 1966.

2. **NO.** The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is not indispensable where the issues are purely legal in nature and the action complained of is patently illegal, arbitrary, and oppressive (*Pascual v. Provincial Board of Nueva Ecija*). Here, the removal of Florindo via the abolition of his office was a clear violation of his rights.

3. **NO.** The abolition of the office was null and void. While the Provincial Board has the power to abolish positions, it cannot do so to circumvent the constitutional security of tenure of civil service employees (*Cruz v. Primicias*). The stated reason for abolition—that the position was created to locate "hidden funds" and Florindo failed to do so—was unproven. Florindo, a permanent employee, was effectively removed without cause and due process.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
