I. CAPTION
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LOURDES GASPAR BAUTISTA, THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS and THE NATIONAL TREASURER OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21362, November 29, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Lourdes Gaspar Bautista obtained a P4,000 loan from the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (now DBP), secured by a mortgage on a parcel of land covered by O.C.T. No. P-389 [1, 2]. Upon Bautista's failure to pay, DBP extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage, acquired the property as the highest bidder, and consolidated ownership in 1952, resulting in the issuance of a new title in DBP's name [3]. Subsequently, in a separate action (Civil Case No. 870) filed by third parties against the Government and DBP, the court declared the titles null and void [3]. Bautista was not made a party to this annulment proceeding [4, 5]. Consequently, DBP filed a complaint against Bautista to recover the original mortgage indebtedness, arguing that the satisfaction of the debt was negated by the annulment of the title [5]. The lower court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the annulment judgment could not bind Bautista as she was not given her day in court [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N DBP can recover the unpaid mortgage debt from Bautista after the foreclosed title was annulled in a judicial proceeding where she was not a party.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the fundamental due process requirement was disregarded [8]. Bautista cannot be made to suffer the effects of a decision rendered in a case where she was not a party [9]. Since DBP had already satisfied the obligation through extrajudicial foreclosure, it could not revive the debt based on the subsequent annulment of the title, as that judgment is null and void with respect to Bautista for lack of jurisdiction over her person [9, 10].

The Court applied the principle underlying **Article 1558 of the Civil Code**, which states that a vendor is not obliged to make good a warranty unless summoned in the suit for eviction. By analogy, Bautista should have been summoned to defend her title; having been denied this opportunity, she is not liable [11]. Additionally, DBP's claim against the Assurance Fund was denied because **Section 101 of the Land Registration Act** requires that the party sustaining loss must not be negligent, and DBP was found solely responsible for its predicament [12].

**Judgment affirmed.**
