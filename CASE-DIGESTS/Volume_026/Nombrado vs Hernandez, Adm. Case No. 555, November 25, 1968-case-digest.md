I. CAPTION
ERNESTO M. NOMBRADO v. ATTY. JUANITO T. HERNANDEZ, Adm. Case No. 555, November 25, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ernesto Nombrado filed a disbarment case against respondent Atty. Juanito Hernandez on two counts of malpractice. Under the first count, respondent was previously engaged by Arsenio Pansaon in 1952 as counsel in a criminal case for serious physical injuries against Eufemio Nazareno. The mauling incident in that case arose from a dispute over a parcel of land between Pansaon and Eufemio’s father, Crispin Nazareno. Years later, respondent Hernandez appeared as counsel for Crispin Nazareno in a civil case for forcible entry against Pansaon, involving the same parcel of land. Pansaon alleged that he lost the civil case because respondent used confidential information regarding the land's ownership acquired during their prior attorney-client relationship. Respondent denied this, claiming he only obtained information about the mauling incident itself, not the land.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N respondent is guilty of malpractice for representing a client whose interest is adverse to a former client in a case involving the same subject matter.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that respondent departed from the strict norms of professional conduct. Even if the respondent did not use any information acquired as counsel against his former client, he undeniably became privy to information regarding the ownership of the land, which was the root cause of the criminal case and the subject of the later forcible entry case [1].

Citing *Hilado v. David*, the Court ruled that the "existence of the bare relationship of attorney and client" is the yardstick for testing incompatibility of interests [2]. This rule is founded on public policy to protect the client's secrets and avoid the appearance of treachery and double-dealing [2]. Furthermore, under *San Jose v. Cruz*, an attorney owes loyalty to his client even after the relationship has terminated and is not permitted to defend another person against a former client under the pretext that the new case is distinct from the former one [3].

Respondent Juanito T. Hernandez is **REPRIMANDED and WARNED** that a repetition of unprofessional conduct will be dealt with more severely.
