I. CAPTION
MELECIO COQUIA, MARIA ESPANUEVA and MANILA YELLOW TAXICAB CO., INC. v. FIELDMEN'S INSURANCE CO., INC., G.R. No. L-23276, November 29, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Manila Yellow Taxicab Co., Inc. (Insured) held a common carrier accident insurance policy with Fieldmen's Insurance Co., Inc. (Company). On February 10, 1962, a taxi covered by the policy, driven by Carlito Coquia, met an accident in Pangasinan, resulting in Carlito's death. The Insured filed a claim for P5,000.00. The Company offered P2,000.00 as a compromise, which the Insured rejected. Consequently, the Insured and Carlito’s parents, Melecio Coquia and Maria Espanueva (Coquias), filed a complaint against the Company to collect the policy proceeds.

The Company admitted the policy's existence but raised two defenses: (1) the Coquias had no cause of action as they were not parties to the contract; and (2) the Insured failed to comply with the policy's arbitration clause, which was a condition precedent to any suit. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, sentencing the Company to pay P4,000.00. The Company appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Coquias have a cause of action against the insurer despite not being parties to the insurance contract.
2. W/N the plaintiffs' failure to resort to arbitration bars the filing of the suit.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the insurance policy is a contract *pour autrui* (a stipulation in favor of a third person) under the second paragraph of Article 1311 of the Civil Code [1]. The policy expressly provided indemnity for "any authorized Driver" and, in case of death, his "personal representatives," with the option to pay "heirs of claimants" directly [2]. The Court noted that the "true intention" of the policy was to protect the liabilities of the Insured towards third parties [2]. Furthermore, the deceased driver paid 50% of the premiums through deductions from his commissions [3]. As the sole heirs of the deceased, the Coquias have a direct cause of action against the Company [3].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the parties waived their right to demand arbitration [4]. The record showed that neither party invoked the arbitration section during the negotiations preceding the suit, nor did they suggest settling the dispute via arbitration [4]. Their conduct was inconsistent with the notion that they treated the arbitration provision as in effect, thereby amounting to a waiver [5, 6].

Decision affirmed [7].
