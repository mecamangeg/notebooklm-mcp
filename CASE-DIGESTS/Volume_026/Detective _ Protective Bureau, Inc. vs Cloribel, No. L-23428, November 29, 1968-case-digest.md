I. CAPTION
DETECTIVE & PROTECTIVE BUREAU, INC. v. THE HONORABLE GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL and FAUSTO S. ALBERTO, G.R. No. L-23428, November 29, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner corporation filed a complaint for accounting and receivership against respondent Alberto, its former managing director. Although stockholders removed Alberto from office, he refused to vacate and seized corporate records, claiming he owned the controlling interest (P57,727.29 vs. P4,000.00). The trial court (Judge Cloribel) initially issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining Alberto after a hearing. However, upon Alberto's filing of a counter-bond, the Judge issued an order admitting the bond and dissolving the writ. Petitioner filed this certiorari petition directly with the Supreme Court without filing a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing the dissolution was illegal because the motion was unverified and the injunction was issued after a hearing.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a motion to dissolve a preliminary injunction requires verification.
2. W/N a preliminary injunction issued after a hearing may be dissolved.
3. W/N the petition for certiorari is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO/DEPENDS.** Under **Section 6, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court**, the necessity of verification depends on the ground alleged. If the application is based on the insufficiency of the complaint, verification is not required. If based on the ground that the injunction would cause great damage to the defendant while the plaintiff can be fully compensated, the motion should be verified [1, 2]. Since the motion was not in the record, the Court presumed regularity in the trial court's order [3].

2. **YES.** A writ of preliminary injunction is an **interlocutory order** and remains under the control of the court before final judgment [4]. The rule that an injunction "if granted *ex parte*, may be dissolved" does not put injunctions granted after a hearing beyond the reach of the court [5]. Under **Section 7, Rule 58**, the trial court has wide latitude to modify or dissolve the writ as justice may require [6, 7]. Furthermore, as the controlling interest in the corporation was in dispute, the Court applied the principle that a preliminary injunction should not transfer property in litigation from the possession of one party to another when legal title is disputed [8, 9].

3. **NO.** The petition was **DISMISSED**. First, there was no manifest abuse of discretion by the trial court. Second, the petitioner failed to file a **Motion for Reconsideration** with the lower court before filing for certiorari. This procedural requirement is mandatory to give the trial court an opportunity to correct its error, and none of the exceptions (question of jurisdiction, patent nullity, or deprivation of due process) were present [10, 11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
