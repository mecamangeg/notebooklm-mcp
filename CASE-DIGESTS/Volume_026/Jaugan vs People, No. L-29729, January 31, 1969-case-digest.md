I. CAPTION
DEMETRIO JAUGAN v. THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES and THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-29729, January 31, 1969, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Demetrio Jaugan was convicted of homicide by the Court of Appeals. He received notice of the decision on June 20, 1968 [1], [2]. After being granted an extension, he filed a motion for reconsideration and/or new trial on July 23, 1968, which the Court of Appeals denied on August 6, 1968 [1], [3]. Jaugan received notice of this denial on August 22, 1968 [3], [4]. Under Section 1, Rule 45, he had 15 days from August 23, 1968, or until September 6, 1968, to appeal by certiorari to the Supreme Court [3], [4]. Instead of appealing, he filed a "motion for permission to file a second motion for reconsideration" with the Court of Appeals on August 23, 1968 [5], [4]. This was denied, and he subsequently filed his petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court on October 29, 1968 [5], [6]. The Supreme Court initially denied the petition for being late, prompting Jaugan to file the current motion for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration with the High Court [7], [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the filing of a motion for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration with the Court of Appeals suspended the 15-day period to appeal to the Supreme Court.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Supreme Court ruled that the motion for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration and/or new trial did not suspend the running of the 15-day period provided for in Section 1 of Rule 45 of the Rules of Court [5], [6]. Consequently, the period to appeal expired on September 6, 1968, making the petition for certiorari filed on October 29, 1968, significantly late [3], [6]. The Court emphasized that no more than one motion for reconsideration shall be filed without express leave of court under Section 1, Rule 52 [9].

Petitioner's motion for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration is denied [10].
