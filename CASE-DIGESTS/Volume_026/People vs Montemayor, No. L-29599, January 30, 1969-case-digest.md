I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ISABELO MONTEMAYOR, ET AL., G.R. No. L-29599, January 30, 1969, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
The Acting City Fiscal of Cadiz City sought to appeal a judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental on September 7, 1968, which acquitted the accused, Carlos Caramonte [1, 2]. The Fiscal filed the appeal alleging that the trial judge's decision constituted a "flagrant act of maladministration of justice" and argued the "enormity of the injustice" perpetrated [2, 3]. The Solicitor General commented that the appeal invoked by the Fiscal would constitute double jeopardy and should not be allowed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the State may appeal a judgment of acquittal based on a flagrant error committed by the trial court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the appeal is barred by the principle of double jeopardy [5]. Citing the doctrine in *People v. Bringas* and *Kepner v. United States*, the Court ruled that an appeal from a judgment of acquittal by the State is obnoxious to the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy [6]. The Court emphasized that no error, however flagrant, committed by the court against the State can be reserved for review once the defendant has been placed in jeopardy and discharged [7]. Arguments regarding the "flagrant error" or a desire for a "more severe penalty" are not sufficiently weighty to disregard this doctrine [8].

Appeal dismissed [5].
