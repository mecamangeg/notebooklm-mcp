I. CAPTION
RILECO, INC. v. MINDANAO CONGRESS OF LABOR-RAMIE UNITED FARM WORKERS' ASSOCIATION (LOCAL) and THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-22243, November 29, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Mindanao Congress of Labor-Ramie United Farm Workers' Association filed a petition for certification election, claiming to represent employees of the Manolita Plantation owned by petitioner Rileco, Inc. [1]. Rileco filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) lacked jurisdiction because the plantation was engaged solely in agricultural work [2]. The CIR denied the motion and ordered the Department of Labor to conduct an election among the workers [3, 4]. Rileco appealed, contending the nature of its operations—ramie culture—is agricultural. The process involves soil preparation, planting, care for 100 days, cutting stalks, stripping them using electric decorticating machines, drying, and brushing fibers for the market [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over workers engaged in ramie culture.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that ramie culture is an agricultural undertaking, and thus, the CIR has no jurisdiction.

Under Section 2 of Republic Act No. 602, "agricultural" includes farming in all its branches, including cultivation, growing, and harvesting of commodities, and practices performed by a farmer as an incident to farming operations [6]. The law excludes the manufacturing or processing of specific crops like sugar and pineapples, but ramie is not excluded [6].

The Court held that the processing of ramie fiber, involving the use of decorticating machines, stripping, and drying, is similar to the processing of abaca and hemp, which constitutes "purely agricultural work" [7]. The processing does not convert the fiber into a different product, and the mere use of modern machines as labor-saving devices does not alter the agricultural nature of the undertaking [7, 8]. Since the work is agricultural, the CIR lacked jurisdiction over the certification election [8].

The petition was granted, and the CIR decision was set aside [9].
