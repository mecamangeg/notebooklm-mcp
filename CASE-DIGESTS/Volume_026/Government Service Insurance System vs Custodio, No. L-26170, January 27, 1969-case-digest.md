I. CAPTION
GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM v. SUSANA CUSTODIO, et al., G.R. No. L-26170, January 27, 1969, 136 Phil. 659, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Simeon Custodio, a GSIS retiree, died intestate. He was survived by his sister, Susana Custodio, and several nephews and nieces (children of his predeceased brothers). An unsigned retirement application was found naming Susana as the beneficiary, but it was never submitted to the GSIS. On July 7, 1957, Susana and several nephews and nieces executed an "Extra Judicial Settlement of Estate" recognizing Susana as the sole beneficiary of Simeon's retirement benefits. However, three heirs—Macario C., Luisa, and David—did not sign the deed. The day after the execution, the signatory nephews and nieces wrote to the GSIS repudiating the settlement, claiming they signed inadvertently without understanding. GSIS filed an interpleader suit to determine who was entitled to the benefits. The trial court ruled in favor of Susana, holding the settlement valid absent proof of fraud. The nephews and nieces appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the non-signatory heirs (Macario C., Luisa, and David) are bound by the Extra Judicial Settlement recognizing Susana as sole beneficiary.
2. W/N the Extra Judicial Settlement is voidable due to fraud or mistake regarding the signatory heirs.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The intestate heirs who did not sign the deed cannot be considered as having recognized Susana Custodio as the sole beneficiary. There was no evidence that they agreed to the settlement or accepted benefits under it. Consequently, they are entitled to inherit *per stirpes* in accordance with Article 1005 of the Civil Code. Macario C. inherits by representation the one-fourth share of his father, while Luisa and David are entitled to their aliquot shares of their father's portion.

2. **NO.** The plea of fraud or error is not allowable as it was not specifically pleaded or stipulated upon, and is deemed waived under Rule 9, Section 9 of the Rules of Court. The signatories' repudiation was merely a self-serving act indicative of a "belated intention to squirm out of a disadvantageous transaction," which is not a ground for setting aside a validly executed instrument (*Noble v. City of Manila*). Weightier proof is required to invalidate a written instrument (*Mendezona v. Phil. Sugar Estates*).

Judgment is affirmed with modification granting Macario C., Luisa, and David their respective shares.
