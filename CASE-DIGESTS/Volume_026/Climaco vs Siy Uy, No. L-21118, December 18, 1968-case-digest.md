I. CAPTION
LEON CLIMACO v. CARLOS SIY UY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21118, December 18, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In a decision promulgated on April 27, 1967, the Supreme Court set aside the lower court's order dismissing the complaint against defendant Manuel Co and remanded the case for further proceedings "with costs," while affirming the dismissal regarding defendant Carlos Siy Uy [1, 2]. A motion was subsequently filed in the Supreme Court seeking a clarificatory judgment regarding who should pay the costs of the proceedings given the split result [1, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N defendant Manuel Co is solely liable for the payment of costs.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the costs should be paid by Manuel Co only [2]. The Court reasoned that while the dismissal of the complaint was correct regarding Carlos Siy Uy, it was erroneous with respect to Manuel Co [2]. Since the order of dismissal was issued to resolve a motion to dismiss filed in the name of both defendants, and the Supreme Court set aside that order concerning Manuel Co, he is the party responsible for the costs [2, 4]. The judgment was clarified accordingly [5].
