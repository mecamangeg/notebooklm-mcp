**I. CAPTION**
CITY OF LEGAZPI v. THE HONORABLE ROBERTO ZURBANO, et al., G.R. No. L-25589, November 29, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Several plaintiffs filed an action for damages in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Albay against the City of Legazpi and other defendants following a vehicular accident involving a city-owned fire truck [1, 2]. The City of Legazpi filed a motion to dismiss the complaint (except as to one plaintiff, Juan Marbella) on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the amount claimed by each of the other plaintiffs did not exceed P10,000.00, which was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Municipal Court at that time [3]. The CFI denied the motion, holding that it had jurisdiction based on the Rules of Court regarding joinder of causes of action, which it interpreted to allow the aggregation of claims [4, 5]. The City appealed directly to the Supreme Court [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the jurisdiction of the court is determined by the aggregate amount of the separate claims of multiple plaintiffs joined in a single complaint.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court, ruling that Section 88 of the Judiciary Act is the sole standard for jurisdiction [6]. This section explicitly states that "where the claims or causes of action joined in a single complaint are separately owned by or due to different parties, each separate claim shall furnish the jurisdictional test" [6]. The Court emphasized that the Constitution vests Congress with the power to define jurisdiction, and statutory enactments prevail over the Rules of Court [6]. Procedural rules on joinder are designed to save unnecessary work and expense but cannot be used to enlarge a court's jurisdiction [7].

Consequently, the order of the CFI assuming jurisdiction was annulled and set aside, and the lower court was directed to dismiss the claims of the plaintiffs that fell within the jurisdiction of the municipal court [8].
