I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. UNUH BAKANG and INDANAN TARANG**, G.R. No. L-20908, January 31, 1969, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of June 10, 1959, in Basilan City, nine Muslim bandits, including appellants Unuh Bakang and Indanan Tarang, armed with bladed weapons and firearms, entered the house of Paleng Toto. They hog-tied the inmates, ransacked the house for valuables, and hacked the victims with bladed weapons. Paleng Toto and Mahajiril Toto died from their wounds, while three others (Kapek, Sabu Paleng, and Enjeng) survived due to timely medical attention.

The appellants were charged with robbery in band (Case No. 910) and "double murder, with multiple frustrated murder" (Case No. 911). The trial court acquitted them of robbery but found them guilty in Case No. 911 of the complex crime of "double murder, with multiple frustrated murder," sentencing each to *reclusión perpetua*. The appellants appealed, challenging the finding of a complex crime and their liability.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the crimes committed constitute a complex crime of double murder with multiple frustrated murder.
2. W/N the aggravating circumstance of treachery was present.
3. W/N the aggravating circumstance of "by a band" should increase the penalty.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the crimes were not complex because different acts of hacking were performed by different bandits. Under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code, a complex crime exists only when a single act constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies. Here, there were distinct acts resulting in distinct crimes. Consequently, the appellants are criminally liable for two distinct murders and three distinct frustrated murders, not a single complex crime [1, 2].

2. **YES.** Treachery was present because the victims were hog-tied and defenseless when the bandits hacked them on vital parts of their bodies. This ensures the commission of the crime without risk to the offenders [1].

3. **NO.** While the crime was committed by a band, the Court affirmed the lower court's finding that this aggravating circumstance was offset by the mitigating circumstance of the appellants being illiterate non-Christians, pursuant to Section 106 of the Administrative Code of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu [2].

**Disposition:** The judgment is **MODIFIED**. The appellants are sentenced to two separate penalties of *reclusión perpetua* for the two murders, and indeterminate penalties for each of the three frustrated murders. They are ordered to pay *in solidum* increased civil indemnity of P12,000 to the heirs of each deceased victim [3].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Fernando, Teehankee, and Barredo concurred with the decision [4].
