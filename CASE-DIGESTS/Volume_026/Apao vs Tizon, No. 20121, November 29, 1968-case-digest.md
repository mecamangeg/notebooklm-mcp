I. CAPTION
ALFREDO APAO, ET AL. v. HON. TITO V. TIZON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20121, November 29, 1968, 26 SCRA 195, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On July 10, 1962, a complaint for double murder was filed against petitioners Alfredo Apao, et al. in the Justice of the Peace Court of Molave, Zamboanga del Sur. After petitioners waived their right to preliminary investigation, the case was remanded to the Court of First Instance (CFI). On July 17, 1962, petitioners filed an urgent motion for bail. Respondent Judge Tito V. Tizon denied the motion on July 24, 1962, ruling it was premature because the Provincial Fiscal had not yet filed the corresponding information. Despite petitioners urging the Fiscal to act, the filing was delayed as the Fiscal could not confer with witnesses. Petitioners then filed a petition for mandamus and habeas corpus with the Supreme Court to compel the respondent Judge to expeditiously hear and resolve their motion for bail. During the pendency of the action, the Fiscal finally filed the information on September 4, 1962, and the respondent Judge subsequently heard and denied the motion for bail on September 28, 1962.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for mandamus and habeas corpus has become moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the case had become moot and academic. The records established that during the pendency of the proceedings, the information for double murder (Criminal Case No. 2073) was filed against the petitioners. Furthermore, pursuant to a resolution issued by the Supreme Court, the respondent Judge had already set the hearing for the motion for bail and subsequently issued an order denying said motion on September 28, 1962. Since the acts sought to be compelled—the hearing and resolution of the motion for bail—had already been performed, there was no longer a justiciable controversy.

Case dismissed.
