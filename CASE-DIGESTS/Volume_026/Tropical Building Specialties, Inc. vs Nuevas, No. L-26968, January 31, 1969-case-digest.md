I. CAPTION
TROPICAL BUILDING SPECIALTIES, INC. v. JAIME NUEVAS, G.R. No. L-26968, January 31, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Tropical Building Specialties, Inc. (Tropical) filed a case against Jaime Nuevas in the Municipal Court of Manila to recover P3,815.63 for materials delivered between 1961 and 1964 [1, 2]. Nuevas admitted deliveries up to June 1961 but claimed lack of knowledge regarding subsequent deliveries, despite failing to request a bill of particulars [2]. The Municipal Court ruled in favor of Tropical [2].

Nuevas appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [3]. The hearing was postponed five times at Nuevas' instance on the ground of amicable settlement efforts [3, 4]. On March 15, 1966, the CFI granted a postponement to April 21, 1966, explicitly warning it was "for the last time" [5]. Nuevas failed to appear on April 21, allowing Tropical to present evidence *ex parte*, but the CFI later reconsidered and set a new hearing for July 7, 1966 [5]. On July 6, the eve of the hearing, Nuevas filed an unverified petition to postpone, claiming a conflicting hearing in Cavite [5]. The CFI denied the petition and dismissed the appeal [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court committed a reversible error in denying the motion for postponement and dismissing the appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the appeal. The Court held that postponements are matters primarily addressed to the discretion of the court, the exercise of which will not be interfered with on appeal in the absence of manifest abuse [4, 7].

The Court found no abuse of discretion given that: (1) the hearing had already been postponed five times at the defendant's request; (2) the defendant was explicitly warned that the April 21 hearing was the "last" and no further postponements would be countenanced; (3) although the defendant claimed a conflict with a Cavite case set earlier, he waited until the eve of the July 7 hearing to file his petition; and (4) the record suggested the appeal was purely dilatory as the defendant used the pretext of amicable settlement to secure postponements and apparently had no valid defense [4]. The Court cited established jurisprudence, including *Lichauco v. Lim* and *Samson v. Naval*, to support the principle that the trial court's discretion in such matters is paramount [4].

Accordingly, the order dismissing the appeal was **AFFIRMED** [8].
