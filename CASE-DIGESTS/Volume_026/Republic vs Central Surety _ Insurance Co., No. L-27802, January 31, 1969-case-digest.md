I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CENTRAL SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-27802, January 31, 1969, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On November 13, 1968, Central Surety & Insurance Company filed a "Motion to Modify Judgment" seeking corrections to the Supreme Court's decision dated October 26, 1968 [1]. The Surety requested the correction of the date of the complaint's filing to June 20, 1963, and the specific inclusion of third-party defendants Go Siu Eng and Jao Yan *alias* Go Liao Lian, alongside Po Kee Kam and Tony Go [1, 2]. Additionally, the Surety prayed for the inclusion of 12% interest per annum, compounded quarterly, and 15% attorney's fees in the dispositive portion regarding the third-party defendants' liability [2]. The Republic offered no objection, confirming the records supported the motion, while the third-party defendants failed to comment [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the decision dated October 26, 1968 should be modified to reflect the correct dates, parties, and indemnity obligations.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court granted the motion, finding the grounds meritorious and sustained by the record [4, 5]. The decision was modified to reflect that the Republic filed suit on June 20, 1963, and to explicitly name all third-party defendants [5]. The dispositive portion was also amended to order the third-party defendants to pay the Surety whatever sums the latter pays the Republic, plus interest at the rate of 12% per annum, compounded quarterly, and attorney's fees of 15% of the total amount [6].

Decision modified [7, 8].
