I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SENCIO GUTIERREZ, JOSE QUIRINO and DONDO CABRAL, G.R. No. L-25372, November 29, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On December 29, 1963, in Gandara, Samar, Liberato Tabuena was killed. Earlier that evening, a fight occurred between Tito Julaton and Ely Colili, leaving Ely wounded near Liberato's house. The accused Sencio Gutierrez, Jose Quirino, and Dondo Cabral arrived and asked Liberato for a hammock to transport Ely. After Liberato helped carry Ely to his yard and was tying the hammock, Gutierrez suddenly stabbed him in the back, followed by Quirino hacking his shoulder. As Liberato fled, the three accused pursued him and inflicted twelve wounds, causing his death.

The Court of First Instance of Samar convicted the accused of murder, sentencing them to life imprisonment. The accused appealed, claiming alibi—stating they were at the nearby house of Ildefonso Versoza—and argued that the trial court erred in denying their motion for a new trial to present Ely Colili as a witness.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi can prosper against positive identification.
2. W/N the lower court erred in denying the motion for a new trial.
3. W/N the crime committed was murder.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The defense of alibi cannot prosper because it was not physically impossible for the accused to be at the scene of the crime, as the house where they claimed to stay was only a few meters away. Furthermore, the "semi-alibi" cannot prevail over the positive identification by prosecution witnesses (the victim's son and housemate), whose testimony was fully corroborated by the number and location of the victim's wounds (*People v. Marasigan*).

2. **NO.** The granting of a new trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. The motion was untenable because the proposed testimony of Ely Colili was concededly corroborative and cumulative, not newly discovered evidence. The defense had previously waived this testimony (*PAL v. Salcedo*).

3. **YES.** The victim sustained multiple wounds, some inflicted from behind, and was attacked simultaneously by three men armed with bolos while he was unarmed. The accused acted with abuse of superior strength and treachery. Treachery absorbs the abuse of superior strength, qualifying the crime as murder (*People v. Verzo*).

**Disposition:** The decision is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the indemnity is increased from P6,000 to P12,000, in line with *People v. Pantoja*.
