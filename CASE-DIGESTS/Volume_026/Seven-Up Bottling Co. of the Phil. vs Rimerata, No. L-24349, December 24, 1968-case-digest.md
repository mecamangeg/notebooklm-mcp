I. CAPTION
SEVEN-UP BOTTLING COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES v. VIRGILIO RIMERATA and the WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-24349, December 24, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Virgilio Rimerata was employed as a laboratory helper in the production department of petitioner Seven-Up Bottling Company from 1953 to 1962 [1]. His duties included preparing sugar, tasting syrup mixtures, weighing ingredients such as citric acid and carbonated water, pouring caustic soda, and carrying 16-54 sacks of sugar daily [1]. On April 6, 1962, Rimerata suffered stomach pains and vomiting while working and was diagnosed with peptic ulcer by the company physician [1]. Despite medical treatment, his condition did not improve, and his services were terminated on December 15, 1962 due to his continued illness [1]. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) ordered Seven-Up to pay compensation benefits, finding the illness work-connected and the disability persisting until January 15, 1965 [2, 3]. Seven-Up petitioned for review, arguing that the ulcer was not work-connected and disputing the duration of the disability [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claimant's peptic ulcer is compensable under the Workmen's Compensation Act.
2. W/N the Supreme Court may review the WCC's factual finding regarding the duration of the claimant's disability.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the ailment was compensable because the evidence showed that the ingredients Rimerata was required to taste or swallow in the discharge of his duties probably irritated his stomach linings, producing or aggravating the peptic ulcer [5]. The Court applied the test of compensability: it is sufficient that the employee's ailment is shown to be attributable to, reasonably connected with, or aggravated by the nature and conditions of his work [5].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that it could not review the WCC's finding that the disability lasted until January 15, 1965 [3]. The Court reiterated the doctrine that findings of fact by the Workmen's Compensation Commission, if supported by substantial evidence in the record, are conclusive and may no longer be reviewed on appeal [3].

The appealed decision is AFFIRMED [6].
