I. CAPTION
MARIA REYES DE TOLENTINO, assisted by her husband LUCIO TOLENTINO v. HON. GODOFREDO ESCALONA, VIRGILIO C. LENTEJAS, and SINFOROSO B. ANOTA, G.R. No. L-26556, January 24, 1969, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Spouses Tolentino were plaintiffs in a civil case for reformation of a deed against the Llamas spouses, represented by respondent Atty. Sinforoso Anota [1]. After the Court of Appeals rendered a favorable decision permitting the Tolentinos to redeem the subject land, Atty. Anota filed a petition in the same lower court case (CFI Leyte) for attorney's fees [2, 3]. The Tolentinos opposed the amount but asked the court to fix the fees [3]. Respondent Judge Escalona issued an order fixing the fees at P4,000.00 [3]. The Tolentinos moved for reconsideration, and the judge conditionally reduced the fees to P2,000.00 provided it was consigned by a specific date; otherwise, the original P4,000.00 would stand [4]. The Tolentinos failed to consign the amount [5]. Consequently, a writ of execution was issued, and the sheriff sold the land at public auction to Atty. Anota [6, 7]. Eleven months later, the Tolentinos filed this petition for certiorari, arguing that the lower court lacked jurisdiction over the claim for attorney's fees as it was foreign to the main litigation and the amount was below the court's jurisdiction [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for certiorari is the proper remedy.
2. W/N the trial court had jurisdiction to hear and decide the claim for attorney's fees within the main action.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The proper remedy was an appeal from the trial court's orders fixing the attorney's fees. The Supreme Court held that certiorari is not available to offset the adverse effects of a failure to interpose a timely appeal [8]. The petitioners failed to appeal the contested orders and cannot now avail of certiorari [8].

2. **YES.** The trial court had jurisdiction on two grounds. First, the petitioners are in **estoppel** because they not only failed to object to the court's jurisdiction but actively asked the court to fix and later reduce the amount of the fees [9]. Second, a claim for attorney's fees is an **incident** of the case in which services were rendered [10]. It is well-settled that such a claim may be asserted in the very action where services were rendered, even if the amount is less than the minimum prescribed for the court's jurisdiction, provided the main action is within said jurisdiction [10, 11].

The petition is **DISMISSED** and the writ denied [12].
