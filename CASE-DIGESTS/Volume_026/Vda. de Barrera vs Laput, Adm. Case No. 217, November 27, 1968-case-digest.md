I. CAPTION
NIEVES RILLAS VDA. DE BARRERA v. CASIANO U. LAPUT, Adm. Case No. 217, November 27, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Atty. Casiano U. Laput was counsel for the complainant, Nieves Rillas Vda. de Barrera, a 72-year-old woman, in the settlement of her husband's estate [1, 2]. On January 10, 1955, wishing to close the proceedings to collect his fees, Laput presented a petition and notice for Barrera to sign [3]. When Barrera refused and requested to have the papers read by someone else first, Laput became angry at her distrust [1, 3]. He placed his revolver on his lap to intimidate her, compelling her to sign the documents out of fear [1, 3, 4]. Barrera filed an administrative complaint for misappropriation and coercion. The Solicitor General investigated, recommending the dismissal of the misappropriation charges but finding sufficient evidence for coercion, praying for a one-year suspension [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N respondent is guilty of gross misconduct for intimidating his client.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the respondent is guilty of gross misconduct in office [2, 7]. While he did not point the firearm at her, his intent in placing the gun on his lap was clearly to intimidate his client [2, 7]. The Court held that such acts are "improper and censurable," compounded by the fact that the offender is a member of the Bar and an officer of the Court who should set an example as a "man of peace" [8-10]. It is worse that the offended party was his own client, a 72-year-old woman he was pledged to protect [2, 10]. Although the Court noted mitigating circumstances—that he acted in obfuscation feeling insulted by her lack of trust and that the papers were legally harmless—the act remained gross misconduct [7].

Respondent is suspended from the practice of law for a period of one (1) year [11].
