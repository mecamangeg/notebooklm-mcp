I. CAPTION
LUCIANO A. SAULOG v. CUSTOMBUILT MANUFACTURING CORPORATION, ET AL., G.R. No. L-29612, November 15, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Luciano Saulog sued Custombuilt Manufacturing Corporation (Custombuilt) and others in the City Court of Manila for damages arising from the execution sale of Saulog's properties, which were levied upon to satisfy a judgment against Custombuilt's debtor. The City Court rendered judgment *ex-parte* in favor of Saulog after Custombuilt and its co-defendants failed to appear at trial [1, 2].

Custombuilt appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. During the scheduled pre-trial on November 5, 1964, Custombuilt's counsel was initially present but left the courtroom before the case was called, allegedly due to his wife's labor pains. The client (Custombuilt) was not present [3, 4]. Consequently, the CFI dismissed the appeal and revived the City Court’s judgment. Custombuilt filed a petition for relief, which the CFI denied, prompting this appeal to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CFI properly dismissed the defendant’s appeal and revived the lower court judgment due to the failure of the defendant and counsel to appear at the pre-trial.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of the trial court. Under Section 1, Rule 20 of the Rules of Court, the appearance of both the client and counsel at the pre-trial is mandatory [4]. The failure of the client to appear is a ground for dismissal [4].

While Custombuilt’s counsel claimed he left due to an emergency, he failed to notify the court or opposing counsel, which constitutes a lack of foresight and interest [4, 5]. Furthermore, the remedy of dismissing a defendant's appeal for failure to prosecute is authorized under Section 9, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court [6]. Upon such dismissal, the judgment of the inferior court is deemed revived and remanded for execution [7].

The Court of First Instance's order of November 5, 1964 is affirmed [8].
