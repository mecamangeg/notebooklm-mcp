**I. CAPTION**
BRIGIDO TOQUIB v. ATTY. VALERIANO TOMOL, JR., Adm. Case No. 554, January 3, 1969, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Atty. Tomol was counsel for the defendant, Hermogenes Toquib (complainant’s father), in a civil case regarding real property [1, 2]. After the plaintiffs rested their case, respondent moved to take the deposition of his client due to age and infirmity, which was granted [2]. However, the client failed to appear at the scheduled deposition on December 22, 1960 [2]. Respondent’s motion for postponement was denied, and he subsequently took no steps to reschedule the deposition or present evidence [2, 3]. Consequently, on May 19, 1961, the lower court submitted the case for decision, and on May 25, 1961, rendered judgment against the defendant, ordering him to vacate the property [4].

Although a copy of the decision was served on respondent on June 7, 1961, through his authorized agent, he failed to notify his client or file an appeal [5, 6]. When the complainant inquired about the case status, respondent repeatedly told him to wait for notice [7]. It was only in June 1962, when a writ of execution was served, that the client learned of the adverse decision [5]. Respondent advised them to accept the writ, as the period for appeal and relief from judgment had already lapsed [5, 8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N respondent is guilty of gross negligence and professional misconduct.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court found respondent's conduct to be not merely simple laxity but "insensibility to the misfortune of his client brought about by an adverse decision occasioned by the attorney's own gross negligence" [9].

The Court held that respondent failed in his duty to make representations to the court to withhold action or reschedule the deposition after his client failed to appear [3]. Furthermore, despite receiving the adverse decision, he did not notify his client, allowed the period of appeal to lapse, and failed to seek relief from judgment [9]. This conduct violated **Canon 15 of the Canons of Professional Ethics**, which requires a lawyer to owe "entire devotion to the interest of the client" [10]. Citing *Blanza vs. Arcangel*, the Court described his conduct as reprehensible and far below the standard of "par excellence" required of the legal profession [10].

**ACCORDINGLY**, respondent is **SUSPENDED** from the practice of law for one (1) year [11].
