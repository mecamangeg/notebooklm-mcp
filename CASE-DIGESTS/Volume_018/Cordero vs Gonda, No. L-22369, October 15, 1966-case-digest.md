I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE TESTATE ESTATE OF PATRICIO PONFERRADA, deceased. JOAQUIN CORDERO, administrator and appellee, vs. JOSE GONDA, in his capacity as Representative of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, claimant and appellant, G.R. No. L-22369, October 15, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On September 18, 1953, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) made a formal demand upon Patricio Ponferrada for the payment of P3,805.88 in forest charges covering the period from 1946 to 1949 [1]. Ponferrada made a partial payment, leaving a balance of P3,543.51 [1]. Ponferrada died in 1957, and Joaquin Cordero was appointed administrator of his estate [2].

On July 29, 1959, the BIR, through respondent Gonda, filed a claim for the unpaid balance in the testate estate proceedings [2]. The administrator opposed the claim on the ground of prescription [2]. The Court of First Instance of Masbate declared that the claim had prescribed [3]. The BIR appealed, arguing that forest charges are not taxes but contractual obligations (prices for timber) governed by the 10-year prescriptive period in the Civil Code, relying on the doctrine in *Collector v. Pio Barretto* [4-6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the government's action to collect the forest charges has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the action was barred by the five-year prescriptive period under the Tax Code [7, 8].

The Supreme Court explicitly abandoned the ruling in *Collector v. Pio Barretto*, which previously characterized forest charges as contractual prices for timber [5, 9]. The Court ruled that forest charges are unequivocally "internal revenue taxes" under Section 18 of the Tax Code, which lists "charges on forest products" as sources of national internal revenue [10, 11]. They are taxes on the privilege of severing or extracting natural resources, similar to mining taxes, and accrue to the general fund to support government services [12, 13].

Since forest charges are internal revenue taxes, the prescriptive periods in the Tax Code apply [14]. Under Section 332(c) of the Tax Code, a proceeding in court to collect an assessed tax must be begun within five years after the assessment [15, 16]. The assessment was deemed made on September 18, 1953, when the BIR made a formal demand for a definite amount [7]. The claim filed in court on July 29, 1959, was filed more than five years later [7].

The Court further ruled that Ponferrada's partial payment did not interrupt the prescriptive period because it did not constitute a "written agreement" to extend the period as required by Section 332(c), nor was it a waiver of the defense of prescription [17, 18].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [8].
