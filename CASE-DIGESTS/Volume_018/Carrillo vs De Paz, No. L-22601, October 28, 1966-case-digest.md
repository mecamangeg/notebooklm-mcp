**I. CAPTION**
PRIMA G. CARRILLO and LORENZO LICUP v. FRANCISCA SALAK DE PAZ and ERNESTO BAUTISTA, G.R. No. L-22601, October 28, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Severino Salak and Petra Garcia originally owned Lot No. 221 in Tarlac. Through a series of successions following the massacre of the Salak family during the war, a 1/2 portion of the lot passed to Agustina de Guzman Vda. de Carrillo. In a prior proceeding (Special Proceeding No. 23), the Court of Appeals declared that the properties inherited by Agustina were subject to *reserva troncal*. Agustina, the *reservista*, died on April 24, 1950. The defendant, Francisca Salak de Paz, had been in possession of the lot since 1946.

On April 22, 1963, plaintiffs Prima Carrillo and Lorenzo Licup filed a suit to recover their shares of the lot, claiming to be *reservatarios* (relatives within the third degree). The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of *res judicata* and prescription. The lower court dismissed the case based on *res judicata*. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the plaintiffs' action to recover the reservable property is barred by prescription.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal but grounded its ruling on prescription rather than *res judicata*.

The Court held that *reserva troncal* (under Article 891 of the New Civil Code and Article 811 of the old Civil Code) is extinguished upon the death of the *reservista*. Upon such death, the right of full ownership becomes vested in the *reservatarios*, who then have the standing to file a reivindicatory suit. Consequently, the plaintiffs' cause of action accrued on **April 24, 1950**, the date Agustina (the *reservista*) died.

The applicable law on prescription was Section 40 of the Code of Civil Procedure (applied via Article 1116 of the New Civil Code), which fixes a **ten-year** period for actions to recover real property calculated from the accrual of the cause of action. Since the plaintiffs filed their suit on **April 22, 1963**—nearly 13 years after Agustina's death—their right to recover the property had already prescribed. The Court cited authorities (Manresa and Scaevola) confirming that prescription runs against *reservatarios* if they fail to exercise their rights within the statutory period.

**Order of dismissal affirmed.**
