I. CAPTION
NEMESIA V. ALAMA v. THE HONORABLE MACAPANTON ABBAS and THE PROVINCIAL FISCAL OF DAVAO, G.R. No. L-19616, November 29, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alama pleaded guilty to five criminal cases for malversation of public funds through falsification of official documents in the Court of First Instance of Davao. Following the promulgation of judgment on December 19, 1961, she filed a notice of appeal on January 3, 1962, within the reglementary period. Respondent Judge Abbas ordered petitioner's counsel to file a manifestation stating the questions of law to be raised on appeal. Counsel complied, citing issues of misrepresentation in the plea and excessive penalties. On February 8, 1962, Judge Abbas disallowed the appeal, ruling that the plea of guilty waived defects in the information and that the other arguments involved questions of fact or were not supported by the record. Petitioner filed this petition for mandamus to compel the judge to give due course to the appeal [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court has the authority to disallow a perfected appeal in a criminal case on the ground that the issues raised are factual, frivolous, or waived by a plea of guilty.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that once an appeal in a criminal case is perfected, the court *a quo* loses jurisdiction over the record and the subject of the case [5]. In criminal proceedings, an appeal is perfected by filing a notice of appeal with the court and serving a copy upon the adverse party within 15 days [5].

The Court held that whether the issues to be raised are factual, or whether the appeal is frivolous or dilatory, is a matter for the appellate court to decide, not the trial court [6]. Furthermore, unlike in civil cases under Rule 42 (where an appeal on pure questions of law must be stated in the notice), the Rules of Court regarding criminal appeals (Rule 122) do not require the appellant to specify that the appeal is based purely on questions of law in the notice of appeal [7]. Consequently, the respondent Judge erred in requiring specifications of questions of law and in disallowing the appeal [8].

Petition is **GRANTED**. The order disallowing the appeal is set aside, and the respondent Judge is ordered to give due course to petitioner’s appeal [9].
