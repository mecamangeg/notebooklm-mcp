I. CAPTION
HOSPICIA ENCABO, et al. v. CEBU PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY, G.R. No. L-17571, December 17, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On December 2, 1953, petitioners (the Encisos) filed an action against respondent Cebu Portland Cement Company (Cepoc) to recover possession of a 17,341-square-meter parcel of land in Naga, Cebu. The Encisos claimed they sold only 15,000 square meters to Cepoc in 1937 and allowed Cepoc to use the adjacent lots (the subject property) upon a promise of rentals and employment. Cepoc constructed permanent improvements, including a hospital and residential houses, on the land.

Cepoc initially claimed ownership via the Law of Waters and a foreshore lease but later amended its answer to claim fee simple ownership of the entire 30,714.90 square meters based on a Deed of Sale dated September 1, 1936. A certified copy of this Deed was found in the Division of Archives. The Encisos alleged the Deed was a forgery, relying on an NBI handwriting expert's opinion stating the signatures were not genuine. The Court of First Instance of Cebu dismissed the complaint, ruling in favor of Cepoc.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 1936 Deed of Sale is genuine despite the adverse opinion of a handwriting expert.
2. W/N the trial court erred in admitting the second amended answer to conform to the evidence.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled the Deed of Sale is genuine. Opinions of handwriting experts are not binding upon the courts, particularly when the expert is not presented as a witness to allow for cross-examination. The Court found the alleged differences in signatures to be negligible or explainable by the passage of time. Conversely, the discovery of the Deed in the Division of Archives creates a strong presumption in favor of its genuineness. Furthermore, Cepoc’s ownership is supported by its registration of the land in 1937 without opposition and its open, continuous possession and construction of permanent improvements for over 15 years before the Encisos filed suit.

2. **NO.** The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the second amended answer. At the time the amendment was submitted, Cepoc had already introduced evidence proving the purchase of 30,000 square meters rather than 15,000. The amendment was properly allowed to make the pleadings conform to the evidence already in the record.

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.
