I. CAPTION
LEONARDO ABUYO, ET AL. v. CONCEPCION B. DE SUAZO, G.R. No. L-21202, October 29, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Ambrosio Abuyo, the father of the plaintiffs-appellants, was the original owner of a 10-hectare land covered by an Original Certificate of Title. On May 8, 1939, Ambrosio sold a 3-hectare portion of this land to Gregorio Suazo, the deceased husband of defendant-appellee Concepcion B. de Suazo [1]. The Suazos took possession of the portion, fenced it, and paid taxes on it. Ambrosio died in 1946 [1].

The plaintiffs filed a suit in the Court of First Instance of Basilan City to recover the 3-hectare portion, arguing that the deed of sale was unrecorded and therefore not binding. The trial court ruled in favor of the defendant [2]. The plaintiffs appealed directly to the Supreme Court, asking the Court to review the evidence regarding the genuineness of the deed and arguing that the unrecorded sale was invalid against them [1, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court can review the factual finding regarding the genuineness of the deed of sale in a direct appeal.
2. W/N an unrecorded deed of sale of registered land is binding on the heirs of the vendor.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A direct appeal from the Court of First Instance to the Supreme Court binds the appellant to the findings of fact of the trial court, as they are deemed to have accepted the facts found by the lower court. The appellant may only raise questions of law. Therefore, the trial court's finding that the deed of sale was genuine is final and not open to question [3, 4].

2. **YES.** Under Section 50 of the Land Registration Act, an unrecorded deed of sale operates as a contract between the parties and as authority to register. The Court held that such a deed is binding between the vendor and the vendee because actual notice is equivalent to registration [5]. This binding effect extends to the vendor's privies, which includes his heirs. Since heirs are not considered "third persons" for whom the protection of registration is intended, the failure to register the deed does not annul the vendee's ownership rights against said heirs [5-7].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [8].
