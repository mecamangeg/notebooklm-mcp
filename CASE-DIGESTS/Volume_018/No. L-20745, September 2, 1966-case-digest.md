**I. CAPTION**
**DOLORES GRANADA and ESTRELLA GRANADA, ET AL., petitioners, vs. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, ET AL., respondents**, G.R. No. L-20745, September 2, 1966, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners Dolores and Estrella Granada (along with their deceased sisters) obtained sugar crop loans from respondent Philippine National Bank (PNB), signing promissory notes as makers. When PNB filed a complaint for collection of the unpaid balances, petitioners filed a motion to dismiss, claiming they merely acted as agents of their parents, Matias and Cristeta Granada, who owned the hacienda for which the loans were used [1, 2]. Petitioners subsequently moved to have their mother, Cristeta, impleaded as a party defendant. The trial court granted this, and PNB filed an amended complaint [3, 4]. In this amended complaint, PNB inserted the phrase that the petitioners borrowed the funds "as representatives of their parents" [5].

Solely on the strength of this phrase in the amended complaint, the Court of First Instance held that petitioners were not personally liable and dismissed the case against them [6]. PNB appealed. The Court of Appeals reversed the decision, ruling that the petitioners were liable [6, 7]. The CA found that the insertion was a mistake and that PNB had consistently maintained petitioners' personal liability in its other pleadings and the promissory notes [8]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioners are personally liable for the loans despite the admission in the amended complaint that they acted "as representatives of their parents."

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals. While the general rule is that facts alleged in a party's pleading are deemed admissions binding upon them, this rule is not absolute or inflexible [7, 9]. Every admission must be taken as an entirety, and evidence *aliunde* can be presented to show that the admission was made through palpable mistake (*Irlanda v. Pitargue*) [10].

The Court found that PNB never intended to change the cause of action embodied in the original complaint, which sought to hold petitioners personally liable based on the promissory notes [11]. The amendment was made merely to comply with the trial court's order to implead the mother. Under the Rules of Court, which must be liberally construed, the amended complaint should be treated as including several defendants in the alternative—a course of action sanctioned by Section 13, Rule 3, and Section 9, Rule 15 [12, 13]. Since the promissory notes clearly showed petitioners signed as principals, and the "representative" allegation was an explainable mistake in pleading alternative reliefs, they remain personally liable.

The petition is dismissed, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [11].
