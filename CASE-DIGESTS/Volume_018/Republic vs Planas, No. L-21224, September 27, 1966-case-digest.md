I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CARMEN PLANAS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21224, September 27, 1966, 18 SCRA 132, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Carmen Planas was assessed war profits tax. She appealed the assessment to the Board of Tax Appeals (BTA) and subsequently to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-5866). To guarantee payment, Planas and respondent Alto Surety & Insurance Co., Inc. executed a bond conditioned upon the payment of the tax "if and when the decision of the Supreme Court [in G.R. No. L-5866] will be adverse to the principal." The Supreme Court later dismissed G.R. No. L-5866 "without prejudice" because the BTA lacked jurisdiction.

Subsequently, the Republic filed Civil Case No. 49206 against Planas to collect the tax. The trial court dismissed this case on the ground of prescription, and the Republic did not appeal. Later, the Republic filed the present action (Civil Case No. 51090) against Planas and Alto Surety to forfeit the bond and collect the same tax liabilities. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the grounds of *res judicata* and lack of cause of action.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the present action to collect the tax via the bond is barred by *res judicata*.
2. W/N the surety is liable under the bond.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The action is barred by *res judicata* due to the final dismissal of the prior Civil Case No. 49206 on the ground of prescription. The Court held that although the forms of the two actions (collection of tax vs. forfeiture of bond) and the relief prayed for may appear different, the parties are actually litigating the same cause of action: the collection of the alleged war profits tax. A party cannot escape *res judicata* by varying the form of action or presentation of the case (citing *Ipekdjian Merchandising Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals*). Furthermore, the inclusion of the Surety as an additional party in the second case does not nullify the effect of the prior judgment (citing *Aquino v. Sanvictores*).

2. **NO.** The surety is not bound because the condition of the bond was not fulfilled. The bond expressly stipulated liability only "if and when the decision of the Supreme Court... will be adverse to the Principal." Since the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal in G.R. No. L-5866 "without prejudice" and made no finding on the liability due to the BTA's lack of jurisdiction, the condition did not happen. Unlike in cases like *Republic v. Araneta* where bonds were posted to guarantee taxes *already acknowledged* as due, the bond here guaranteed a *pending controversy* contingent on a specific judicial outcome that never occurred.

Decision affirmed.
