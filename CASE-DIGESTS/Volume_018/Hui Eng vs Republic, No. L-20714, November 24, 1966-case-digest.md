**I. CAPTION**
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. HUI ENG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-20714, November 24, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Hui Eng filed for naturalization, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental. The Solicitor General appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. The records showed that the petitioner had an average annual income of P6,000. He was married with five children, four of whom were of school age (two were high school age). Furthermore, the petitioner sent his children to Chinese schools, specifically Chiang Kai Shek High School in Manila and Misamis Chinese High School in Ozamis City.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the petitioner has evinced a sincere desire to embrace Filipino customs and traditions.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that an average annual income of P6,000 is not lucrative for an applicant who is married with five children, considering the prevailing high cost of living. The Court noted that this insufficiency is even more apparent given that two of the children were of high school age. The Court relied on established jurisprudence in *Keng Giok v. Republic* and *Justo Tan v. Republic* regarding the economic qualification for naturalization.

2. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner failed to evince a sincere desire to embrace Filipino customs and traditions or to be socially assimilated. Sending his school-age children to Chinese schools (Chiang Kai Shek High School and Misamis Chinese High School) bars naturalization as it indicates a lack of intent to mingle with Filipinos. The Court cited *Ong Ching Guan v. Republic* and *Lim Yueng v. Republic* to support this denial.

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DISMISSED**.
