I. CAPTION
NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION v. FELIPE GATUANGCO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21865, November 12, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
The National Power Corporation (NPC) filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao to expropriate several parcels of land needed for the construction of access roads, canals, and flumes for the Talomo River No. 2 Hydro-Electric Project [1]. Some of the defendants, including Gatuangco, had acquired their lots from the National Abaca and Other Fibers Corporation (NAFCO) through sales patents under Republic Act No. 477 [1].

Commissioners appointed by the trial court recommended a just compensation of P1,000.00 per hectare [2]. NPC objected to this valuation regarding the lots acquired under R.A. 477, arguing that under Section 114 of the Public Land Law (Commonwealth Act No. 141) and Section 8 of R.A. 477, the indemnity should be limited to the amount the defendants originally paid to NAFCO [2]. The trial court rejected NPC's contention, ruling that the lands were now private properties acquired under a special law rather than the Public Land Law directly, and ordered NPC to pay the P1,000.00 per hectare rate [3, 4]. NPC appealed directly to the Supreme Court on a question of law [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the just compensation for lands acquired under R.A. 477 is limited to the amount paid to the government pursuant to Section 114 of the Public Land Law.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while the lands are now private property, they remain subject to the provisions of the Public Land Law (C.A. 141) because Section 8 of R.A. 477 explicitly provides that dispositions under said Act are governed by C.A. 141 [6, 7].

Section 114 of C.A. 141 reserves to the Government and its concessionaires the right to use the land for hydroelectric power purposes [8]. The law specifies that when the Government takes possession of such land for these purposes, the grantee is entitled to indemnity only "in the amount, if any, paid by him to the Government for the land taken from him" [8]. The Court ruled that these statutory reservations constitute legal encumbrances and limitations ingrained in the rights conveyed to the grantees, which bind the land even after it leaves the public domain [9]. Since the defendants failed to prove they introduced improvements, they are entitled only to reimbursement of the purchase price they paid to NAFCO [10].

The decision was modified to set the indemnity in proportion to the price paid by the appellees to NAFCO [11].
