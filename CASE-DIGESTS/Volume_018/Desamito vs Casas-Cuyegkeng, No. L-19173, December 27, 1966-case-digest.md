**I. CAPTION**
ROSE DESAMITO v. TRINIDAD CASAS-CUYEGKENG, assisted by her husband ALFONSO CUYEGKENG, G.R. No. L-19173, December 27, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Trinidad Casas-Cuyegkeng filed an ejectment suit against petitioner Rose Desamito in the Municipal Court of Manila for non-payment of rentals and need of the premises [1]. Desamito answered, alleging that Casas-Cuyegkeng breached an agreement to allow the transfer of the lease to a buyer, causing the buyer to withdraw and resulting in damages of P125,000 [2]. Desamito initially reserved the right to file a separate action for these damages [2]. While the ejectment case was pending, Desamito filed a separate complaint for damages in the Court of First Instance (CFI) (Civil Case No. 39449) based on the same facts [3].

The Municipal Court ruled in favor of Casas-Cuyegkeng [4]. Desamito appealed to the CFI (Civil Case No. 40481), where she filed a new answer reproducing her counterclaim for P125,000 damages [4], [5]. The CFI decided the appealed ejectment case in favor of Casas-Cuyegkeng and dismissed Desamito's counterclaim [6]. This decision became final after being affirmed by the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court [7]. Consequently, the CFI dismissed Desamito's separate damages suit (Case No. 39449) on the ground that the issue had been resolved in the ejectment case [7]. Desamito appealed, arguing that the CFI in the ejectment appeal could not have validly ruled on the damages claim because the amount exceeded the Municipal Court's jurisdiction [8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the separate action for damages is barred by the judgment in the appealed ejectment suit.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the separate action was barred by the final judgment in the ejectment case [9], [10]. Although the counterclaim for P125,000 was beyond the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court, the CFI in the appealed ejectment case (No. 40481) could and did take cognizance of the issue in the exercise of its **original jurisdiction** [11].

The Court applied **Section 11, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court**, which provides that if a case is tried by an inferior court without jurisdiction over the subject matter, the CFI on appeal may try the case on the merits in the exercise of its original jurisdiction if the parties file pleadings and go to trial without objection [11], [10]. Since Desamito squarely put the issue of damages in her answer in the appealed case and the parties did not object, the CFI’s resolution of that issue was valid [11]. Because that decision became final, *res judicata* applies, precluding further relitigation of the damages claim [12], [10].

Orders affirmed [9].
