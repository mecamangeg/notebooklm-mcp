I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED AS CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, DY BU SI alias FILADELFO DY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22076, October 29, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Dy Bu Si, a Chinese national born in 1927 who arrived in the Philippines in 1929, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Samar on December 10, 1959 [1, 2]. He is married with six children and reported an annual income of P4,612.10 [2]. The petition was published in the newspaper "Nueva Era" upon the order of the lower court [1, 2]. Evidence showed Dy Bu Si used the name "Filadelfo Dy" as an alias without authority [3]. Additionally, while he testified to having previously resided in Lucena, Quezon, and other towns in Samar, he failed to state these previous residences in his petition [4]. The lower court granted the petition and subsequently allowed his oath-taking [5]. The Republic appealed on the same day the oath-taking was allowed, challenging his qualifications [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the publication requirement was satisfied regarding the newspaper's general circulation.
2. W/N the petitioner is disqualified for using an unauthorized alias.
3. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative income.
4. W/N the failure to state previous places of residence in the petition is fatal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petitioner failed to prove that "Nueva Era" was a newspaper of general circulation in Samar. The Court held that even if the lower court ordered the publication, it is incumbent upon the petitioner to present positive evidence of general circulation in the province where he resides [2, 6]. An affidavit from the Editor is insufficient proof [6].
2. **YES.** The use of the alias "Filadelfo Dy" without judicial authority disqualifies the petitioner for naturalization, as established in *Tan v. Republic* and *Chiu Bok v. Republic* [3].
3. **NO.** An annual income of P4,612.10 is not considered lucrative for an applicant with a wife and six children to support, failing to satisfy the legal requirement [4].
4. **YES.** The failure to state all previous places of residence (specifically Lucena, Quezon, as admitted in testimony) makes the petition fatally defective under the ruling in *Cheng v. Republic* [4].

ACCORDINGLY, the decision granting the petition is REVERSED and the petition is DISMISSED [7].
