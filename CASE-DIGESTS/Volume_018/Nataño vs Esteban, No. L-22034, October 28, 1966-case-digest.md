I. CAPTION
PEDRO NATAÑO, ET AL. v. SENEN ESTEBAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22034, October 28, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Pedro Nataño discovered that his registered land was transferred to defendant Senen Esteban through a forged deed of sale. Esteban subsequently transferred the title to Ramona Dagle, who mortgaged the property to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC, now DBP). Nataño filed a suit to quiet title and annotated a notice of *lis pendens*.

Before trial on the merits, the defendants moved for a preliminary hearing on their affirmative defense, arguing that RFC was an innocent mortgagee for value. The trial court dismissed the complaint, ruling that RFC’s status as an innocent purchaser for value barred the plaintiffs from recovering the title. Following the dismissal, the court granted the defendants' *ex parte* motion to cancel the notice of *lis pendens*.

The plaintiffs moved for reconsideration, attaching a certification from the Register of Deeds showing that the RFC mortgage had actually been released/cancelled prior to the dismissal order. The trial court denied the motion for lack of an affidavit of merits.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal of the complaint based on the existence of a mortgage to a third party was proper.
2. W/N the cancellation of the notice of *lis pendens* was proper.
3. W/N an affidavit of merits was required for the motion for reconsideration.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The dismissal was erroneous. Under Section 55 of the Land Registration Act (Act 496), a registered owner deprived of title by fraud may pursue legal and equitable remedies against the parties to the fraud, subject only to the "rights of any innocent holder for value of a certificate of title." The fact that the land was mortgaged to a third party does not stop the suit by the legitimate owner against the fraudulent transferee to recover the title; the owner must merely respect the lien acquired by the innocent mortgagee. The Land Registration Act was never designed to serve as a shield for fraud [1, 2]. Furthermore, the mortgage relied upon by the trial court had already been released when the dismissal order was issued [3].

2. **NO.** The cancellation was improper for three reasons: (1) it was granted *ex parte*, depriving plaintiffs of their right to be heard; (2) the order dismissing the complaint had not yet become final; and (3) there was no showing that the notice was intended to molest the adverse party or was unnecessary to protect the plaintiffs' rights, as required by the Rules of Court [4].

3. **NO.** An affidavit of merits is not required because the motion for reconsideration was not a motion for a new trial, as the case was dismissed on a preliminary hearing without a trial on the merits [5]. Additionally, the certification of the Register of Deeds regarding the cancellation of the mortgage served the purpose of an affidavit of merits [6].

ACCORDINGLY, the orders of the lower court are REVERSED and SET ASIDE; the notice of *lis pendens* is declared in full force; and the case is remanded for trial on the merits.
