I. CAPTION
HERMINIGILDO GUEVARA v. HON. JUDGE JOSE M. SANTOS of the COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS and GUILLERMO PONCE, G.R. No. L-19716, November 23, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In 1958, respondent Guillermo Ponce filed ejectment cases against tenants-lessees Herminigildo Guevara and Apolonio Javinia in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) [1]. The CAR found that Guevara caused the death of 28 coconut trees by heaping hay at their base which was subsequently burned, while Javinia caused the death of 6 trees by negligently plowing too closely to them, thereby cutting their roots [2, 3]. Consequently, the CAR ordered them to vacate their landholdings [1]. Petitioners appealed, arguing that the destruction of the trees did not constitute "serious injury to the land" nor impair its productive capacity, and thus did not warrant ejectment under Section 50(f) of the Agricultural Tenancy Act [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the tenants-lessees may be dispossessed for causing the death of coconut trees on their landholdings.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the petitioners failed "to exercise the diligence of a good father of the family to preserve the improvements existing in their holdings" [4]. This negligence constituted a violation of **Section 43 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act (R.A. No. 1199)**, which mandates that a tenant-lessee must make proper use of the land and improvements and cultivate it in accordance with proven farm practices [4-6]. The Court ruled that a violation of Section 43 is a sufficient statutory ground for dispossession under **Section 50(b)** of the Act, which penalizes the failure to comply with the terms of the law [4, 7]. The Court rejected the petitioners' reliance on Section 50(f) (regarding injury to the land itself) as sophistic, emphasizing their failure to care for the improvements. Judgment affirmed [8].
