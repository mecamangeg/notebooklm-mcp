I. CAPTION
INTER-ISLAND GAS SERVICE, INC. v. BRIGIDO DE LA CERNA, G.R. No. L-17631, October 19, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Inter-Island Gas Service, Inc. filed an ejectment case against De la Cerna in the Municipal Court of Cebu City. After De la Cerna failed to appear at trial, the court rendered a decision *ex parte* ordering him to vacate and pay unpaid rentals [1], [2]. De la Cerna filed a Petition for Relief from Judgment with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu on May 22, 1953 [3]. Inter-Island Gas answered on December 24, 1953, joining the issues [4]. However, neither party moved for trial for nearly three years [5]. On June 16, 1956, the CFI dismissed the petition for failure to prosecute [4]. De la Cerna appealed, arguing he had checked with the court clerk but was told old cases were given preference [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the petition for relief for failure to prosecute was proper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The dismissal was proper. Under Section 3, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court (formerly Section 3, Rule 30), an action may be dismissed if the plaintiff fails to prosecute for an unreasonable length of time [7]. In this case, the petitioner allowed approximately three years to elapse from the joinder of issues without asking for relief or moving for trial [5].

The Court held that the burden to move the case forward lies with the plaintiff (here, the petitioner for relief) [8]. De la Cerna’s excuse that he relied on the clerk’s statement regarding the court's calendar was deemed insufficient to show diligent effort [6]. The dismissal of an action for failure to prosecute rests upon the sound discretion of the court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion [9].

**Orders affirmed.** Treble costs against the appellant [9].
