I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE REFINING CO., INC. v. RODOLFO GARCIA, EDILBERTO MARCELO and the COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. Nos. L-21871 & L-21962, September 27, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Philippine Refining Co., Inc. (PRC) received reports of losses in its warehouse. On July 8, 1957, respondents Garcia and Marcelo, employed as truck helpers, were on a delivery run inspected and accompanied by company guards and a supervisor. On July 11, 1957, PRC charged them with frustrated qualified theft and suspended them. The criminal charge was later dismissed by the fiscal for insufficiency of evidence. PRC subsequently reinstated the driver but dismissed Garcia and Marcelo effective retroactively to the date of their suspension. The employees filed a suit for reinstatement and damages. The Court of First Instance (CFI) dismissed the case, but the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the decision. The CA found PRC's evidence regarding the theft fabricated and physically impossible, awarding the employees separation pay and moral damages, but denying reinstatement. PRC appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court can review the factual findings of the Court of Appeals.
2. W/N the award of moral damages to the dismissed employees is proper.
3. W/N the employees are entitled to reinstatement.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** In cases appealed from the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court, the latter cannot review questions of fact, which are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals [1, 2]. The High Court is bound by the CA's finding that the charge of theft was untrue [3].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that PRC's conduct constituted an anti-social and oppressive abuse of its right to investigate and dismiss employees, violating Article 1701 of the Civil Code (prohibiting oppression) and Article 21 (human relations) [4, 5]. Bad faith was evident when PRC suspended the employees ostensibly pending the criminal case but dismissed them retroactively before the investigation concluded [6]. This abusive exercise of rights justifies the award of moral damages under Article 2219, No. 10 of the Civil Code [4, 5].

3. **NO.** Under Republic Act No. 1052, as amended by R.A. No. 1787, the law impliedly recognizes the employer's right to dismiss employees hired without a definite period, whether for just cause or not [7, 8]. If the dismissal is without just cause, the employer is liable for termination pay if they fail to serve notice, but the employees are not entitled to reinstatement [7, 8].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed [9].
