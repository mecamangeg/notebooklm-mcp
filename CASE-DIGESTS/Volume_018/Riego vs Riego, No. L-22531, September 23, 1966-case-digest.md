I. CAPTION
REMEGIA RIEGO and AGAPITO REVILLOSA v. PABLO RIEGO, JACINTO RABE and CATALINA PADOLINA, G.R. No. L-22531, September 23, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Remegia Riego and Agapito Revillosa filed a complaint for pre-emption regarding parcels of land sold by defendant Pablo Riego to defendant Catalina Padolina. On November 28, 1962, the trial court dismissed the complaint. A copy of the order of dismissal was served by mail directly on plaintiff Revillosa on December 6, 1962, instead of their counsel of record, Atty. Ortañes de Guia. Plaintiffs did not file a motion for reconsideration until June 26, 1963. The trial court denied the motion for being filed out of time. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing that the period to appeal should be computed from service upon their lawyer, not upon them. The trial court justified the direct service by citing that Atty. de Guia's whereabouts could not be ascertained despite efforts by authorities in Marinduque and Manila, and noted previous cases where he could not be located for service of pleadings or an arrest warrant.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the service of the order of dismissal upon the plaintiff directly, instead of their counsel of record, was valid.

IV. RULING
**YES.** While the general rule under the Revised Rules of Court is that notice must be served upon the attorney of record and not the client (*Santiago v. Court of Appeals*), an exception exists when the court orders otherwise or when the counsel's whereabouts cannot be ascertained (*Tanpinco v. Lozada*).

In this case, the trial court expressly ordered service on the plaintiffs because their counsel, Atty. de Guia, could not be located. The court took judicial notice of other pending cases where De Guia could not be found to receive service of pleadings or even a warrant of arrest. Consequently, the service on the plaintiffs on December 6, 1962, was valid. Since the plaintiffs failed to file their motion for reconsideration within the 30-day period following this valid service, their motion filed on June 26, 1963, was belated.

The order appealed from is affirmed.
