I. CAPTION
PAMPANGA BUS COMPANY, INC. v. REMEDIOS OCFEMIA and SOFRONIAS FLORES, G.R. No. L-21793, October 20, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On March 26, 1962, a cargo truck owned by respondent Remedios Ocfemia and driven by respondent Sofronias Flores collided with a bus owned by petitioner Pampanga Bus Company (Pambusco) in Nueva Ecija [1]. On November 2, 1962, Ocfemia and Flores filed a complaint for damages against Pambusco in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Nueva Ecija (Civil Case No. 4021) [2].

Subsequently, on December 5, 1962, Pambusco filed the present suit against Ocfemia and Flores in the CFI of Pampanga (Civil Case No. 2237) based on the same collision [2]. The respondents filed a Motion to Dismiss the Pampanga case on the ground of *lis pendens* [3]. Pambusco opposed, arguing that it had made an extrajudicial demand before the respondents filed their suit and that it was unaware of the Nueva Ecija case when it filed its complaint [4, 5]. The CFI of Pampanga dismissed the case. Pambusco appealed [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the complaint filed by Pambusco should be dismissed on the ground of *lis pendens*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the requisites of *lis pendens* were present: (1) identity of parties or interests; (2) identity of rights asserted and reliefs prayed for, founded on the same facts; and (3) identity such that the judgment in the pending case would amount to *res judicata* in the other [7, 8].

The Court rejected Pambusco's defense regarding its prior extrajudicial demand, ruling that *lis pendens* refers to a pending "action," which commences only upon the filing of a complaint in court, not upon extrajudicial demand [5]. Furthermore, the fact that Pambusco did not know of the first case when it filed the second is immaterial; the critical fact is the existence of a pending action between the same parties over the same issue [9]. Pambusco's proper remedy was to allege its claim as a counterclaim in the first case to prevent clogging court dockets [9].

The Order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED** [10].
