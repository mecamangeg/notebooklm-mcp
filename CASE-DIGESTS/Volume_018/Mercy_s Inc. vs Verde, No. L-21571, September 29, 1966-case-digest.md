I. CAPTION
MERCY'S INCORPORATED v. HERMINIA VERDE and ERLINDA VERDE, G.R. No. L-21571, September 29, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On November 1, 1951, petitioner Mercy's Inc. leased a store space in Manila to respondents Herminia and Erlinda Verde [1, 2]. The contract stipulated a duration of one year, "renewable at the option of the lessees" [2]. After the original period expired on November 1, 1952, the respondents continued occupying the premises and paying the monthly rental of P300.00 without expressly asking for a new agreement [3, 4]. On December 19, 1957, Mercy's Inc. notified the respondents to vacate the premises [3]. When they refused, Mercy's Inc. filed a complaint for unlawful detainer [1].

The Municipal Court ruled in favor of Mercy's Inc. [5]. On appeal to the Court of First Instance (CFI), the respondents argued that the renewal clause created an indefinite period dependent on their will [6]. The CFI rendered judgment on the pleadings, ruling that the lease had become month-to-month by tacit renewal and ordered the respondents to vacate [7]. Respondents appealed, arguing that the judgment on the pleadings was erroneous because the plaintiff theoretically admitted their defense that they had "exercised" their option to renew [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lease was tacitly renewed on a month-to-month basis upon the lessees' failure to expressly exercise their option to renew.
2. W/N the judgment on the pleadings was proper despite the lessees' allegation that they exercised their option.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the stipulation "renewable at the option of the lessees" required the lessees to actually exercise the privilege and ask for a new agreement before the original term expired [4]. Since they failed to do so, the contract expired on November 1, 1952 [4]. Their continued occupancy was merely upon the acquiescence of the lessor, creating an implied new lease (*tacita reconduccion*) under **Article 1670** of the Civil Code [9]. Since the rent was paid monthly, this implied lease is understood to be from month-to-month under **Article 1687**, not for the period of the original contract [9]. Therefore, the lease was validly terminated when the lessor notified the lessees to vacate [9].

2. **YES.** While a motion for judgment on the pleadings is an admission by the movant of the truth of the opposing party's material allegations, this admission applies only to allegations of **fact** and does not include **conclusions of law** [9]. The respondents' statements that they "exercised" the option and that the lease was "indefinite" were merely incorrect legal conclusions based on their interpretation of the contract, not factual allegations [9].

**Decision affirmed.** [10]
