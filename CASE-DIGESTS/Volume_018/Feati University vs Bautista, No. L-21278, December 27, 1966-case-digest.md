I. CAPTION
FEATI UNIVERSITY v. HON. JOSE S. BAUTISTA, Presiding Judge of the Court of Industrial Relations and FEATI UNIVERSITY FACULTY CLUB-PAFLU, G.R. Nos. L-21278, L-21462, and L-21500, December 27, 1966, 18 SCRA 1191, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On January 14, 1963, the Feati University Faculty Club-PAFLU (Union) informed Feati University (Petitioner) of its organization as a registered labor union composed of professors and instructors. The Union subsequently sent a letter containing twenty-six demands regarding employment terms. The University refused to bargain, questioning the Union's status. Consequently, the Union declared a strike on February 18, 1963, establishing picket lines and disrupting classes. On March 21, 1963, the President of the Philippines certified the dispute to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) pursuant to Section 10 of Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act).

The CIR took cognizance of the case (Case No. 41-IPA) and issued an order on March 30, 1963, denying the University's motion to dismiss and ordering the strikers to return to work. The University filed these petitions for certiorari and prohibition, arguing that the CIR lacked jurisdiction because the University is an educational institution not engaged in industry, and its instructors are independent contractors, not employees, to whom RA 875 does not apply.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Feati University is an "employer" within the purview of the Industrial Peace Act (RA 875) subject to CIR jurisdiction.
2. W/N the University professors and instructors are "employees" entitled to the right to unionize.
3. W/N the CIR has the jurisdiction to issue a return-to-work order in a certified labor dispute.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that while previous jurisprudence exempted educational institutions organized for "lofty purposes" and not for profit from the Industrial Peace Act, Feati University admitted it declares dividends to stockholders and operates for profit [1, 2]. Educational institutions operated for profit are included in the term "employer" under Section 2(c) of RA 875 [3]. The term "industry" in labor laws is given a broad meaning to cover all enterprises operated for profit where persons work to earn a living [4].

2. **YES.** Professors and instructors are employees, not independent contractors. The Court took judicial notice that a university controls the work of its faculty, prescribing courses, schedules, and places of teaching [5]. They are paid wages/salaries and can be laid off [5]. Section 2(d) of RA 875 defines "employee" broadly, and teachers fall within this definition [6, 7]. As employees, they have the right to self-organization under Section 3 of RA 875 [8].

3. **YES.** When a dispute is certified by the President to the CIR under Section 10 of RA 875, the case comes under the operation of Commonwealth Act No. 103 [9]. The power to "fix the terms of employment" in Section 10 is broad enough to authorize the CIR to order strikers to return to work and the employer to readmit them pending the settlement of the dispute [9, 10]. The return-to-work order is valid even if the legality of the strike has not yet been resolved [11].

The petition is **DISMISSED**, and the orders and resolutions of the Court of Industrial Relations are **AFFIRMED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Reyes, J.B.L., J., concurs but reserves his vote on the teacher's right to strike.
