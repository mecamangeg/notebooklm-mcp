I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF TSE VIW alias TSE VEW alias PABLO SIA TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. TSE VIW alias TSE VEW alias PABLO SIA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18281, November 22, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tse Viw filed an application for naturalization, claiming he was employed as a bookkeeper by Walter Johnson & Co. with a monthly salary of P250.00 plus free board and lodging [1]. To prove compliance with tax laws, he presented a certificate from the Assistant Provincial Revenue Officer stating he had "no outstanding tax obligation" as of October 18, 1960, but he did not present evidence that he filed income tax returns [1]. He also used the alias "Pablo Sia," his baptismal name, in his application [2]. The Court of First Instance of Leyte admitted him to Philippine citizenship [3]. The Republic appealed, questioning his tax compliance, the sufficiency of his character witnesses, and his use of an alias.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner sufficiently proved compliance with income tax laws.
2. W/N the character witnesses were competent to vouch for the petitioner.
3. W/N the petitioner's use of an alias was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A certificate stating that the petitioner has "no outstanding tax obligation" is not equivalent to proof that he filed the income tax returns required by law [1, 4]. It is incumbent upon an alien applying for citizenship to prove affirmatively that during the period of his stay in the country, he has complied with the law [1].

2. **NO.** Vouching witnesses stand as insurers of the petitioner's conduct and character [5, 6]. They are expected to testify on specific facts and events justifying the inference that the petitioner possesses all qualifications and none of the disqualifications provided by law [6]. Here, the testimony was too general, and the witnesses failed to show that their association with the petitioner enabled them to acquire definite knowledge of his qualifications [2].

3. **NO.** While "Pablo Sia" was the name given to the petitioner upon baptism, there is nothing in the record showing that he had been judicially authorized to use such name as an alias [2, 3]. Unauthorized use of an alias is a violation of the Anti-Alias Law.

**WHEREFORE**, the decision appealed from is hereby **REVERSED**, and the petitioner's application for citizenship is **DISMISSED** [7].
