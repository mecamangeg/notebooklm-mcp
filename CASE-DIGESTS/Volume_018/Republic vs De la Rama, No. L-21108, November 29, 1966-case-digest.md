**I. CAPTION**
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LEONOR DE LA RAMA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21108, November 29, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

**II. FACTS**
The estate of the late Esteban de la Rama was the subject of special proceedings, with Eliseo Hervas as the executor-administrator [1]. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) assessed a deficiency income tax of P56,032.50 (including surcharge) against the estate for the year 1950, alleging that the estate received P86,800.00 in undeclared cash dividends from the De la Rama Steamship Co. [1]. These dividends were not actually paid to the estate but were applied by the steamship company to offset alleged debts of the deceased and of "Hijos de I. de la Rama" [2, 3]. The administrator, Hervas, had disputed the validity of these debts [4].

Instead of sending the assessment notice to the administrator, the BIR sent notices to the heirs, Lourdes de la Rama-Osmeña and Leonor de la Rama, demanding payment [5]. When the tax remained unpaid, the Republic filed a complaint for collection against the heirs in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [6]. The heirs argued that the dividends were never received and that the assessment notice was invalid as it was not sent to the administrator [6]. The CFI dismissed the complaint [7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the dividends applied to the alleged debts constituted constructive receipt of income taxable to the estate.
2. W/N the tax assessment sent to the heirs, rather than the administrator, was valid and final.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that there was no constructive receipt of income. Under Sections 21 and 56 of the Tax Code, income tax is assessed only on income received [8, 9]. The offsetting of dividends against debts constitutes constructive receipt only if the debts are valid and demandable [10]. Here, the first debt was disputed and unproven, and the second debt was owed by "Hijos de I. de la Rama," a separate legal entity, without proof that the deceased had substituted himself as the debtor [4]. Since the debts were not established, the application of dividends to them was invalid, and the estate did not receive the income either actually or constructively [10, 11].

2. **NO.** The assessment was invalid and produced no legal effect. When an estate is under administration, the notice of assessment must be sent to the administrator, who is the legal representative charged with paying taxes [12]. In this case, notices were sent to the heirs who had no authority to represent the estate while the administration proceedings were still open regarding the collection of these very dividends [12, 13]. Since the proper party (the administrator) never received the assessment, it never became final, and the period to appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals did not commence [12, 14]. Consequently, the CFI had jurisdiction to dismiss the collection case [14].

**Disposition:** Judgment affirmed.
