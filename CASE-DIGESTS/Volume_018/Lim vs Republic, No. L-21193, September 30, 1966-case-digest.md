I. CAPTION
**ANACLETO LIM alias LIM ENG CHUAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-21193, September 30, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Anacleto Lim filed a petition for naturalization around June 1959. The Court of First Instance of Cebu rendered a favorable judgment on November 30, 1960 [1]. On January 19, 1963, after the two-year probationary period required by R.A. 530, the lower court issued an order allowing Lim to take his oath of allegiance. On the very same day, the presiding judge administered the oath to Lim, and a Certificate of Naturalization was subsequently issued [1, 2]. The Government appealed, questioning Lim's qualifications and the precipitate oath-taking.

Lim, who is single, claimed to have a lucrative income based on his employment at the Philippine Bank of Communications and co-ownership of a residential house and stocks inherited from his deceased father [3, 4]. His annual salary at the time of filing in 1959 was P1,620.00, exclusive of bonuses and allowances [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the administration of the oath of allegiance on the same day as the order allowing it was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner's occupation is far from lucrative. Income for naturalization purposes is determined as of the time of the filing of the petition [4, 6]. In 1959, Lim's annual salary was only P1,620.00 [5]. Bonuses, allowances, overtime, and vacation pay are excluded from the computation because of their "contingent character, unsteadiness or instability" (*Yu Kian Chio v. Republic*) [4, 7]. Furthermore, his claim of co-ownership in inherited properties was given little consideration because the estate had not been settled, rendering his specific share unascertained, and the stocks were not shown to be income-producing [3, 8].

2. **NO.** The administration of the oath by the presiding judge on the same day the order was issued was improper and void. The Court held that such precipitate action was "an attempt to render nugatory the government's right to appeal" (*Ong So v. Republic*) [5, 9]. The judge ought to have known the order was not yet final and should have waited for the expiration of the reglementary period for appeal [5].

Consequently, the appealed order, the oath administered, and the Certificate of Naturalization were declared **NULL AND VOID**, and the order was **SET ASIDE** [10].
