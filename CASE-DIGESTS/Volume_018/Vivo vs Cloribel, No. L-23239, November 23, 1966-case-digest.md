I. CAPTION
HON. MARTINIANO P. VIVO, as Acting Commissioner of Immigration v. HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch VI, et al., G.R. No. L-23239, November 23, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Sy King Fong and her minor children arrived in the Philippines on January 17, 1961, as temporary visitors to visit their husband/father, Co Chin. Their authorized stay was extended several times, eventually until October 17, 1961, by the Commissioner of Immigration. Meanwhile, Co Chin’s naturalization petition was granted by the lower court on June 24, 1961. Relying on a 1956 Cabinet Resolution, the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and Justice purported to change the visitors' status to special non-immigrants and extend their stay up to June 24, 1963 (the end of Co Chin's two-year probationary period). However, the Commissioner of Immigration maintained that only he had the authority to extend stays and ordered them to leave by September 18, 1962.

Respondents filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI). Respondent Judge Cloribel issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the Commissioner from arresting or deporting them. On January 7, 1964—long after the alleged extension date of June 24, 1963, had passed—the Commissioner filed a motion to dissolve the injunction. Judge Cloribel denied the motion, prompting the Commissioner to file this petition for certiorari and prohibition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to dissolve the writ of preliminary injunction.
2. W/N the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and Justice had the authority to extend the aliens' stay and change their status based on the Cabinet Resolution.
3. W/N the naturalization of the husband/father automatically entitled the wife and children to residence or citizenship.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The refusal to dissolve the injunction constituted grave abuse of discretion. Even assuming the extension granted by the Secretaries was valid, it expired on June 24, 1963. An extension of an alien's stay is a matter of grace, not of right, and must be strictly construed (*Vivo v. Arca*). Since the authorized period had expired, the case was moot, and the lower court's refusal to lift the injunction allowed the aliens to unduly prolong their unauthorized stay in violation of the law.

2. **NO.** The administration and enforcement of immigration laws lie with the Bureau of Immigration. Under the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, only the Commissioner of Immigration is vested with the power to grant such extensions. The Cabinet has no power to amend the law by resolution. Neither can the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and Justice authorize a change of status from temporary visitors to special non-immigrants without the aliens first departing from the country (*Lim Chiok v. Vivo*).

3. **NO.** The marriage of an alien woman to a Filipino citizen does not automatically make her a citizen; she must satisfactorily establish that she possesses all qualifications and none of the disqualifications (*Brito v. Commissioner of Immigration*). Regarding foreign-born minor children, citizenship is extended only if they are "dwelling" in the Philippines at the time of the parent's naturalization. "Dwelling" means lawful residence. Since the respondents' lawful period of stay expired before the father could take his oath of citizenship, they were no longer lawfully residing in the Philippines (*Kua Suy v. Commissioner of Immigration*).

Petition granted.
