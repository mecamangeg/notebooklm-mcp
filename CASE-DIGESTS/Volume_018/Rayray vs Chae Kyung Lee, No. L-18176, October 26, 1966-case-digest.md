I. CAPTION
LAZARO B. RAYRAY v. CHAE KYUNG LEE, G.R. No. L-18176, October 26, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Lazaro Rayray, a Filipino, met Chae Kyung Lee, a Korean, in Pusan, Korea. They cohabited and were subsequently married in Pusan on March 15, 1953 [1]. Rayray later filed an action for annulment of marriage in the Court of Juvenile and Domestic Relations of Manila, alleging that Lee had a prior subsisting marriage based on an unsigned Korean "police clearance" dated prior to their wedding [1, 2]. Since Lee's whereabouts were unknown, she was served by summons via publication and was eventually declared in default [2]. The City Fiscal intervened and found no collusion [2]. The trial court dismissed the complaint on two grounds: (1) it lacked jurisdiction to nullify a marriage contracted abroad; and (2) the evidence presented was insufficient to warrant relief [2]. Rayray appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court on the question of jurisdiction [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Philippine court has jurisdiction to annul a marriage celebrated in Korea.
2. W/N the marriage should be annulled on the ground of the respondent's alleged prior marriage.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The trial court has jurisdiction to annul the marriage. Jurisdiction over the subject matter is vested in the Courts of First Instance (and the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court in Manila), while jurisdiction over the *res*—the marriage status—depends on the nationality or domicile of the parties, not the *locus celebrationis* (place of celebration) [3, 4]. Marriage is a double status; a decree affects both parties, and jurisdiction is validly acquired if at least one party is a national of or domiciled in the forum [5]. Since the petitioner is a Filipino domiciled in the Philippines, the court has jurisdiction over the validity of his marriage regardless of where it was contracted [4, 5].

2. **NO.** The petitioner failed to prove the respondent's prior marriage. The "police clearance" presented was unsigned, prepared by an unknown person, and constituted hearsay evidence [6]. Furthermore, in the absence of competent evidence regarding Korean law on marriage, the doctrine of processual presumption applies: the foreign law is presumed to be the same as the *lex fori* (Philippine law) [7]. Since Philippine law does not permit bigamy, the fact that the Korean marriage license was issued creates a presumption that no legal impediment existed [7]. Finally, the Court found the petitioner's testimony unworthy of credence, as he admitted to lying about his own civil status in the marriage contract [8].

The decision of the lower court dismissing the complaint is **AFFIRMED** [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro concurred with the ruling [9].
