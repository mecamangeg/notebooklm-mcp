I. CAPTION
TESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED CARLOS GURREA Y MONASTERIO; MARCELO PIJUAN v. MANUELA RUIZ VDA. DE GURREA, G.R. No. L-21917, November 29, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Manuela Ruiz and Carlos Gurrea were married in Spain in 1932. Carlos abandoned her in 1945, moved to the Philippines, and lived maritally with another woman. In 1960, Manuela filed a case for support (Civil Case No. 5820), where she was granted a monthly alimony *pendente lite* of P1,000. Carlos died in 1962, leaving a will that named Marcelo Pijuan as executor and disinherited Manuela and their son. Pijuan instituted Special Proceedings No. 6582 for probate and was appointed special administrator. Manuela filed a motion for the continuation of her alimony and for her appointment as administratrix. The lower court denied the alimony, reasoning that there was no proof the estate properties were conjugal, and denied her appointment as administratrix because an executor was named in the will.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the widow is entitled to support *pendente lite* from the estate.
2. W/N the widow has a preferential right to be appointed administratrix over the executor named in the will.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The lower court erred in denying support due to lack of proof regarding the character of the estate's property. Under Article 160 of the Civil Code, in the absence of proof to the contrary, property is presumed to be conjugal [1]. One-half of these assets presumptively belongs to the widow, in addition to her share as a compulsory heir under Articles 887 and 892, even if the disinheritance clause is later nullified [2]. Given the estate's inventory value of P205,397.64, the P1,000 monthly alimony is justified.

2. **NO.** The preference accorded to the surviving spouse under Section 5, Rule 78 of the Revised Rules of Court applies only when "no executor is named in the will" or the named executor is incompetent or refuses the trust [3]. Here, the deceased left a will naming Pijuan, who accepted the trust. Furthermore, this preference refers to the appointment of a *regular* administrator, not a *special* administrator; the latter lies within the discretion of the probate court and is not appealable [3], [4].

The orders appealed from are **MODIFIED**, granting Manuela Ruiz Vda. de Gurrea a monthly allowance of P1,000.00 from the estate, and **AFFIRMED** in all other respects.
