I. CAPTION
RUSTICO GADDI v. HON. DOMINGO M. CABAÑGON, Judge, Court of Agrarian Relations and FELIPE DIZON, G.R. No. L-16890, October 29, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Felipe Dizon filed a complaint before the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) to eject petitioner Rustico Gaddi, his tenant, for an alleged violation of a surrender agreement. Gaddi failed to appear at the scheduled hearings despite notice. Consequently, the CAR allowed Dizon to present evidence *ex parte* and subsequently rendered a decision ejecting Gaddi for failure to deliver the landlord's share of the harvest.

Counsel for Gaddi received a copy of the decision on February 19, 1960. Five days later, on February 24, 1960, he filed a motion for reconsideration. Counsel received the order denying this motion on April 7, 1960. Instead of filing the petition for review immediately, Gaddi filed an "Urgent Ex-Parte Petition" for extension of time with the lower court. The petition for review was eventually filed with the Supreme Court on May 3, 1960.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for review was filed within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition for being filed out of time. Section 13 of Republic Act No. 1267, as amended, provides that an appeal from a decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations must be filed within 15 days from receipt of the notice of the decision.

In this case, the 15-day period began on February 19, 1960. It was interrupted after 5 days by the filing of the motion for reconsideration on February 24. The remaining 10 days began to run again upon receipt of the denial on April 7, 1960, making the final deadline April 17 or 18, 1960. Since the petition was filed only on May 3, 1960, it was late. The Court further noted that while the petitioner filed a request for extension with the lower court, such a motion should have been directed to the Supreme Court before the expiration of the period.

Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.
