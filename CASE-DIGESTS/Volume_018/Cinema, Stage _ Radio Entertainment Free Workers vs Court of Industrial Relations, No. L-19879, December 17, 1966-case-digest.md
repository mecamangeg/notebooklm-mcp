I. CAPTION
CINEMA, STAGE & RADIO ENTERTAINMENT FREE WORKERS (FFW), MARCIANO DE CASTRO, BRUNO AZORES, and RUFINA FERNANDEZ v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ANGEL GARCHITORENA and LUIS GARCHITORENA, G.R. No. L-19879, December 17, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, employees of respondents Angel and Luis Garchitorena (owners of Metro, Mercury, and Dapitan theaters), filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP). They alleged they were dismissed on November 21, 1954, because of their union activities, claiming respondents interfered with their right to organize, scolded them for forming a union, and offered consideration to dissolve it. Respondents filed a motion to dismiss, asserting the petitioners were supervisory employees and were dismissed for valid causes. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) rendered a decision exonerating respondents from the ULP charge, finding that the dismissals were for just causes such as habitual drunkenness, giving free admissions, negligence, and dishonesty, rather than union activities. The CIR en banc denied the petitioners' motion for reconsideration. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the CIR gravely abused its discretion by ignoring evidence of anti-union discrimination.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners were dismissed for just causes rather than union activities.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court. The Court ruled that it is bound by the findings of fact of the Court of Industrial Relations when such findings are supported by substantial evidence. In this case, the records substantiated the CIR's conclusion that the petitioners were dismissed for valid reasons: habitual drunkenness (De Castro), negligence and giving free admissions (Azores), and dishonesty and gossiping (Fernandez). The Court found no merit in petitioners' claims of anti-union harassment, noting that their transfers were routine policy to prevent connivance, and the alleged "scolding" by the employer was merely a general statement differentiating between honest and dishonest unionism. Since the dismissals were justified by the employees' misconduct, no Unfair Labor Practice was committed.

**Disposition:** Decision and resolution affirmed.
