I. CAPTION
MARTA MENDOZA and HILARIO NONATO v. FELISA DIAZ and DAVID LIWANAG, G.R. No. L-23140, September 29, 1966, 18 SCRA 417, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Felisa Diaz held usufructuary rights over several parcels of land which she leased to Santos Solapco in 1933. After Solapco died, his widow, petitioner Marta Mendoza, continued the lease but stopped paying rentals in 1940. In 1946, Mendoza and her second husband, petitioner Hilario Nonato, executed an affidavit claiming ownership over nine parcels of land and obtained new tax declarations in their names. Diaz filed a complaint in 1954 to recover possession and rentals.

In a prior appeal (CA-G.R. No. 16829-R), the Court of Appeals (CA) found that the parcels claimed by petitioners were "exactly the same" as those leased by Diaz and rejected the petitioners' defense of prescription. The CA remanded the case solely to determine the value of a specific lot and the amount of rentals due. The trial court subsequently rendered judgment ordering petitioners to return possession and pay rentals. The petitioners appealed again to the CA, which affirmed the trial court. Petitioners then elevated the case to the Supreme Court, seeking to relitigate the identity of the lands and the issue of prescription.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the issues of the identity of the lands and prescription may be relitigated in this second appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the questions raised by the petitioners were already passed upon and resolved in the first appeal to the Court of Appeals. The CA's previous finding that the properties leased were "exactly the same" as those claimed by petitioners, and its rejection of the defense of prescription, constitute the **Law of the Case**. Consequently, these matters cannot be relitigated in a second appeal. Furthermore, the Court noted that petitioners had admitted the identity of the lots in their answer to the amended complaint. Regarding petitioners' claim for P4,900, the Court observed this amount had already been deducted by the trial court from the rentals due.

The appealed decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
