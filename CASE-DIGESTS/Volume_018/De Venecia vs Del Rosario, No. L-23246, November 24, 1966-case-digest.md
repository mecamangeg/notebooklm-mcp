I. CAPTION
URBANO DE VENECIA and CRISANTA M. DE VENECIA v. AQUILINO DEL ROSARIO and MARIA DE LA PEÑA, G.R. No. L-23246, November 24, 1966, 18 SCRA 792, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Urbano and Crisanta De Venecia and defendants Aquilino Del Rosario and Maria de la Peña entered into a compromise agreement, approved by the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan on December 12, 1959. The defendants admitted a debt of P6,475.26, paying initial installments and agreeing to pay the balance of P5,000.00 within one year with 12% interest from March 20, 1959. The agreement contained a penal clause stating that if defendants failed to perform, "an additional 10% shall be charged, in addition to the interest, agreed upon, to cover damages."

The defendants failed to pay the balance. Plaintiffs sought execution, and a second alias writ was issued on December 4, 1963. However, the writ only included interest for six months. Plaintiffs moved to amend the writ to include the 12% interest *until the sum is fully paid* alongside the penalty. The lower court denied the motion regarding the continuous interest, ruling that under the law, the penalty takes the place of interest. Plaintiffs appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs may recover both the stipulated interest until full payment and the penalty charge.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court reversed the lower court's orders.

Under Article 1226 of the Civil Code, in obligations with a penal clause, the penalty substitutes the indemnity for damages and the payment of interests in case of non-compliance, *if there is no stipulation to the contrary*.

In this case, the compromise agreement explicitly stated that the 10% penalty is charged "*in addition to the interest, agreed upon*." This phrase constitutes the stipulation to the contrary sanctioned by the Civil Code. The intent of the parties was clearly to allow the recovery of both the penalty and the interest, with the interest running until the debt is fully paid. A writ of execution must conform to the judgment; thus, the writ should be amended to reflect the specific terms of the compromise agreement.

The appealed orders were reversed, and the alias writ of execution was ordered amended to include recovery of 12% interest per annum from March 20, 1959, until the whole debt is fully paid, plus the sum of P500.00 representing the 10% penalty.
