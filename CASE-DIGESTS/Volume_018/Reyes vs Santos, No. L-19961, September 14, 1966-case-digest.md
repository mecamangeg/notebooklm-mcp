**I. CAPTION**
**PILAR REYES v. HON. JOSE M. SANTOS, as Associate Judge of the Court of Agrarian Relations, and MAXIMINO ENRIQUEZ**, G.R. No. L-19961, September 14, 1966, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Pilar Reyes owned a two-hectare parcel of land in Calamba, Laguna, cultivated by respondent Maximino Enriquez under a verbal share tenancy agreement where they shared expenses and harvests equally [1]. On November 18, 1960, one month before the start of the next agricultural year, Enriquez notified Reyes of his intention to change their relationship from share tenancy to leasehold [1]. Reyes opposed the change and filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR), questioning the constitutionality of Section 14 of the Agricultural Tenancy Law (Republic Act No. 1199) [1].

On June 6, 1962, the CAR dismissed the petition, ruling that the respondent tenant had the right to change the tenancy system to leasehold upon proper notice [2]. Reyes appealed by certiorari to the Supreme Court, arguing that Section 14 violates the Constitution by depriving the landowner of property without due process, impairing the obligation of contracts, and constituting class legislation [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Section 14 of the Agricultural Tenancy Law (R.A. 1199), which grants tenants the privilege to change the tenancy agreement from share to leasehold, is constitutional.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations. The Court held that the constitutionality of Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199 has been repeatedly upheld in a line of decisions, specifically citing *Ramas v. Court of Agrarian Relations*, *Macasaet v. Court of Agrarian Relations*, *Uichanco v. Gutierrez*, *Gamboa v. Pallarca*, and *Cuizon v. Ortiz* [3]. The Court rejected the petitioner's arguments that the provision results in deprivation of property without due process, impairs the obligation of contracts, or constitutes class legislation [3].

Accordingly, the decision of the lower court is affirmed, with costs against the appellant [4].
