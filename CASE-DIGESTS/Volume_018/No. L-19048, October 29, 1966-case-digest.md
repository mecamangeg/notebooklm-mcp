I. CAPTION
CENTRAL COOPERATIVE EXCHANGE, INC. v. LA UNION UNITED WORKERS ASSOCIATION (PLUM), G.R. No. L-19048, October 29, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Central Cooperative Exchange, Inc. (CCE) operated a tobacco redrying plant in La Union. The work was seasonal; the 1956 season began in June and ended on August 31, 1956. All employees were served termination papers effective that date. During this season, respondent Union (PLUM) organized and demanded recognition. For the subsequent 1957 season, CCE implemented a hiring policy prioritizing recommendees of landowners who had sold their land to CCE at P0.20 per square meter. Several union members who worked in 1956, including Dominador Padilla (who had been dismissed for theft but later cleared), were not rehired for 1957. The Union filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP), alleging the failure to rehire was discriminatory due to union affiliation. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled in favor of the Union, ordering back wages, holding that the refusal to readmit union members constituted discrimination. CCE appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's failure to rehire seasonal workers who were union members constitutes Unfair Labor Practice.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CIR's decision. The Court ruled that in the case of seasonal workers whose employment explicitly expires at the end of the season, and where there is no preexisting contract between the employer and the union concerning hiring, the employer is free to establish a system of priorities as to whom it would rehire. Adherence to such a system does not constitute Unfair Labor Practice [1, 2].

The Court found that the rehiring for the 1957 season was in the nature of new employment. CCE’s policy of prioritizing recommendees of landowners who sold land at P0.20/sqm was valid and not questioned. There was no substantial evidence that the complaining union members were recommendees of such landowners, nor that they were rejected specifically due to union membership [3, 4]. Regarding Dominador Padilla, the Court noted his non-rehiring was consistent with the policy, as his parents sold land at P0.80/sqm, placing him outside the priority list [5].

The petition is granted. The judgment appealed from is reversed and set aside.
