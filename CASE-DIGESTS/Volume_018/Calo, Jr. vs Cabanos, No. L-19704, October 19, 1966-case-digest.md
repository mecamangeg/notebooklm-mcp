I. CAPTION
TRANQUILINO O. CALO, JR., et al. v. FRANCISCO CABANOS, et al., G.R. No. L-19704, October 19, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Tranquilino Calo, Sr. was the defendant in a civil case filed by Respondents Francisco and Aniana Cabanos for the recovery of possession of land and unpaid rentals. The lower court ruled against Calo, ordering him to pay back rentals in palay or its monetary equivalent until the land was redeemed or delivered. During the proceedings, Calo died and was substituted by his heirs (Petitioners). The judgment became final, and the heirs deposited P4,100 to redeem the property and pay part of the rentals.

Respondent Court granted a writ of execution for the unsatisfied balance of the rentals. The Sheriff issued a letter to Petitioner Calo, Jr., demanding payment of P7,000 within 15 days, warning that failure to settle would result in the confiscation of the land involved in the case. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, arguing, among other things, that the Sheriff’s demand for the full amount effectively and illegally made them solidarily liable for the obligation of the deceased.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Sheriff's demand for the heirs to pay the full judgment amount constitutes an invalid imposition of solidary liability.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the Sheriff’s demand did not render the heirs' liability solidary. The demand letter was addressed to Calo, Jr. simply because he was the lawyer for the other petitioners and they were relying on his decision [1]. The demand was logically for the satisfaction of the whole judgment debt. The Court held that it is of no importance to the judgment creditors how the heirs share in the obligation, as long as it is satisfied in full [1]. Furthermore, the Sheriff's statement regarding the levy on the land—which belonged to the original defendant, Tranquilino Calo, Sr.—to satisfy the indebtedness contracted by him, does not imply that the successors-in-interest are being held jointly and severally liable [1].

Petition denied.
