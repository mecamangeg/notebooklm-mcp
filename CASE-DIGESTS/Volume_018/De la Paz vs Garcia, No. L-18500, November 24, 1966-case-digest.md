I. CAPTION
ARSENIO DE LA PAZ and CLAUDIA MANIO v. MARIO F. GARCIA, assignee of the insolvent ENRIQUE GATBONTON and the COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-18500, November 24, 1966, 18 SCRA 779, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On July 21, 1952, Enrique Gatbonton (who would later be declared insolvent) and his wife sold three parcels of land to Patria Belmonte Anonas for P10,000, executing a simultaneous memorandum-agreement granting Gatbonton the right to repurchase the lands by December 31, 1952 [1]. On September 2, 1952, Gatbonton sold a residential house to petitioners Arsenio De la Paz and Claudia Manio (sister of Gatbonton's wife) for P3,500; this sale was registered on October 14, 1952 [1, 2]. On October 16, 1952, Anonas sold the three parcels of land to the petitioners for P9,000 [1]. On October 20, 1952, Gatbonton filed a petition for voluntary insolvency [3].

Respondent Mario F. Garcia, as assignee of the insolvent, filed an action to annul these transfers as fraudulent [4]. The petitioners argued that under the Civil Code, the sales were merely rescissible, requiring exhaustion of other remedies and restitution of the price, and that Anonas was an indispensable party [4, 5]. The trial court declared the transfers null and void, which the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed, ruling that the transactions were fraudulent schemes under the Insolvency Law rather than the Civil Code [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the transfers of the properties are void as fraudulent transfers under the Insolvency Law.
2. W/N the Civil Code provisions on rescissible contracts apply to this case.
3. W/N the sale of the house falls within the prohibited period under the Insolvency Law.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 70 of the Insolvency Law (Act No. 1956) considers any transfer of properties made by an insolvent within 30 days of the filing of a petition for insolvency as fraudulent and void, unless made in good faith and for valuable pecuniary consideration [6]. The Court found badges of fraud confirming the scheme: the close relationship between the petitioners and the insolvent (sisters); the timing of the sales immediately preceding the insolvency petition; and the fact that Anonas sold the lands to petitioners for P9,000, less than the P10,000 she allegedly paid, suggesting the initial transaction was an equitable mortgage or loan rather than a genuine sale [7-9].

2. **NO.** The Civil Code provisions on rescissible contracts (Arts. 1381, 1383, 1385), which assume the validity of the contract, cannot be invoked because the Insolvency Law regards these specific transfers as absolutely void [10, 11]. Consequently, petitioners' arguments regarding restitution and exhaustion of the debtor's properties are irrelevant [12]. Furthermore, the intermediate transferor, Anonas, is not an indispensable party because the transfer is void and she is immaterial to the title; the assignee can proceed directly against the parties in possession [13, 14].

3. **YES.** While the deed of sale for the house was executed on September 2, 1952 (outside the 30-day period), it was registered on October 14, 1952, only six days before the insolvency petition was filed [2]. The Court held that if a vendee registers the sale of a building, they cannot escape the effects of registration; thus, the date of registration is the basis for determining if the transfer falls within the prohibited period of the Insolvency Law [15, 16].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [17].
