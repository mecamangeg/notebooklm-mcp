**I. CAPTION**
KEATER HUANG, ET AL. v. ASSOCIATED REALTY DEVELOPMENT CO., INC., G.R. No. L-26421, October 29, 1966, Castro, J.

**II. FACTS**
In Civil Case No. 24091 before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, plaintiffs Keater Huang, et al. filed an amended bill of costs praying that the premium on an attachment bond in the amount of P206.85 be taxed against defendant Associated Realty Development Co., Inc. [1]. The Clerk of Court issued a taxation of costs excluding the bond premium [1]. The plaintiffs appealed to the presiding Judge, who affirmed the Clerk’s decision on May 30, 1966, ruling that premiums on attachment and appeal bonds are not allowed as costs [1, 2]. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the premium should be recoverable based on the ruling in *Hunter, Kerr & Co. v. Murray* [1, 3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the premium paid on an attachment bond in an ordinary civil action is taxable as costs against the losing party.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that under Section 10 of Rule 142 of the Revised Rules of Court, the items recoverable as costs by the prevailing party in the CFI are specifically enumerated, and the premium on an attachment bond is unmistakably not among them [4, 5]. The Court explained that the appellants' reliance on *Hunter, Kerr & Co. v. Murray* was misplaced because that case involved an insolvency proceeding where Section 79 of the Insolvency Law (Act 1956) expressly authorized the recovery of bond premiums as preferred debts [6, 7]. Since the present case is an ordinary civil action, the Insolvency Law does not apply, and costs are strictly limited to those listed in Rule 142 [8].

Finding the appeal manifestly and palpably frivolous and completely devoid of merit, the Court **DISMISSED** the appeal and imposed treble costs against the plaintiffs-appellants [9, 10].
