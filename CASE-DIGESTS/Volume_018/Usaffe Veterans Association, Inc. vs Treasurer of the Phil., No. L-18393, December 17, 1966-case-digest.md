I. CAPTION
USAFFE VETERANS ASSOCIATION, INC. v. THE TREASURER OF THE PHILIPPINES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18393, December 17, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In October 1954, petitioner USAFFE Veterans Association, Inc. filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to declare the Romulo-Snyder Agreement of 1950 illegal and to restrain government officials from disbursing funds under it. The CFI upheld the agreement's validity. On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the CFI's decision in G.R. No. L-10500 on June 30, 1959, which subsequently became final and executory.

Despite the finality of the judgment, the petitioner filed a motion for new trial with the CFI on December 28, 1959. They argued that the original decision was contrary to law and cited a manifestation by the Auditor General as a "confession of judgment." The CFI denied the motion, ruling that it could not set aside a final Supreme Court decision and that the evidence was not new. Petitioner appealed the denial orders to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an inferior court has the authority to set aside a final and executory decision of the Supreme Court and grant a new trial.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that it is elementary that an inferior court has no legal authority to set aside a final and executory decision of the Supreme Court and grant a new trial [1-3]. The Court emphasized that if every Court of First Instance were privileged to overrule decisions of the highest tribunal, there would be no end to litigation, resulting in judicial chaos [1, 4]. Inferior courts must maintain a "becoming modesty" and a conscious realization of their position within the integrated judicial system [2, 4]. The Court cited *People vs. Vera* (65 Phil. 56) and *Shioji vs. Harvey* (43 Phil. 333) in support of this principle [1, 2, 4]. The appeal was deemed frivolous, and the orders appealed from were **AFFIRMED** with double costs imposed upon the appellant [3-5].
