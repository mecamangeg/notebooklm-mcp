I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC FLOUR MILLS WORKERS ASSOCIATION and PAFLU v. THE HONORABLE JUDGE ANDRES REYES and AIA FEED MILLS, INC., G.R. No. L-21378, November 28, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On June 1, 1963, petitioners Republic Flour Mills Workers Association and PAFLU declared a strike against their employer, Republic Flour Mills, Inc. (RFM), and formed picket lines around the company premises [1]. Respondent AIA Feed Mills, Inc. (AIA), a lessee occupying a parcel of land owned by RFM, filed a petition for injunction with the Court of First Instance of Rizal. AIA alleged that it was a completely different corporation from RFM with a separate set of officers and employees, and that the picket lines prevented its employees from entering its premises, causing irreparable damage [1].

Petitioners moved to dismiss, arguing the case involved a "labor injunction" and the petition failed to allege the jurisdictional requisites of Section 9(b) of Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act) [2]. The respondent Judge found AIA to be a distinct entity from RFM and issued a writ of preliminary injunction ordering the unions to desist from preventing AIA's employees from entering the premises [2, 3]. Petitioners filed a certiorari petition, contending the Judge acted without jurisdiction by ignoring the strict requirements of R.A. 875 [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge had jurisdiction to issue the writ of preliminary injunction as an ordinary injunction despite non-compliance with the requirements of the Industrial Peace Act.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the respondent Judge acted within his jurisdiction. The Court affirmed the factual finding that AIA Feed Mills, Inc. is a distinct and separate entity from Republic Flour Mills, Inc., possessing a distinct personality and business [4].

Since there was no employer-employee relationship and no "labor dispute" between the petitioner unions and respondent AIA, the strict provisions of Section 9(d) of Republic Act No. 875 did not apply [4]. Citing *Associated Watchmen and Security Union v. United States Lines*, the Court held that if no labor dispute exists, the court may issue an ordinary injunction in accordance with Rule 60 (now Rule 58) of the Rules of Court [4, 5]. The injunction was lawful as it merely ordered the unions to desist from obstructing AIA's employees and did not curtail the unions' right to picket their actual employer, RFM [5].

The petition for certiorari is denied [6].
