I. CAPTION
PIO FELWA, et al. v. RAFAEL SALAS, et al., G.R. No. L-26511, October 29, 1966, 18 SCRA 606, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, the incumbent Provincial Governor, elective board members, and appointive officials of the old Mountain Province, filed an original action for prohibition challenging the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 4695. The Act, approved on June 18, 1966, divided the old Mountain Province into four new provinces: Benguet, Mountain Province, Ifugao, and Kalinga-Apayao [1], [2].

Under the Act's transitory provisions, petitioner Governor Lamen was assigned to the new "Mountain Province," which became a sixth-class province due to limited revenue. Conversely, respondent Vice-Governor Molintas was elevated to Governor of the new Province of Benguet, a second-class province. Petitioners argued this violated the Equal Protection Clause because a former subordinate (Molintas) effectively outranked his former superior (Lamen), and the succession rules treated board members differently from the Vice-Governor [3], [4]. They further alleged that the provision on succession was not covered by the law's title, and that the Act created congressional districts without the constitutional reapportionment and territorial requirements [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Republic Act No. 4695 violates the Equal Protection Clause regarding the assignment and succession of officials.
2. W/N the provision on the succession of officers is embraced in the title of the Act.
3. W/N the Act violates the Constitution regarding the apportionment of congressional districts and the requirement of contiguous and compact territory.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the Equal Protection Clause applies only to persons or things identically situated and does not bar reasonable classification [6]. The classification in R.A. 4695 is reasonable because: (a) the offices of Governor/Vice-Governor are executive, substantially different from the legislative functions of board members, justifying different succession rules [7], [8]; (b) the reduction in the class of the new Mountain Province is a result of its limited revenues, not the Act itself [9]; and (c) assignments were based on residence—Lamen resided in the new Mountain Province and Molintas in Benguet [9].

2. **YES.** (The provision is valid). The title "An Act Creating the Provinces of..." naturally includes providing for the officers who shall run the affairs of said provinces. The provision on succession is manifestly germane to the subject of the legislation [10], [11].

3. **NO.** (The Act does not violate these provisions).
   *   **On Apportionment:** The constitutional requirement for apportionment applies only when creating representative districts *within* a province by Act of Congress. It does not apply when a district comes into existence indirectly through the creation of a province, which occurs by operation of the Constitution ("each province shall have at least one member") [12], [13].
   *   **On Territory:** The requirement that districts comprise contiguous and compact territory is qualified by the phrase "as far as practicable." The delimitation in this case was validly based on the tribes or ethnic groups inhabiting the areas [14], [15].

   Petition dismissed; Judgment affirmed [16].
