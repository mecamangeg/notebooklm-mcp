I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION ASSOCIATION, INC. v. ISMAEL MATHAY and JOSE VELASCO, G.R. No. L-25554, October 4, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On June 20, 1964, Republic Act No. 4134 was approved, increasing the annual salaries of the Senate President and House Speaker to P40,000 and members of Congress to P32,000. Republic Act No. 4642 (The Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1965-1966) authorized the disbursement of these increases. Petitioner PHILCONSA, a non-stock association of taxpayers, filed a suit for prohibition against the Auditor General and the Auditor of Congress to enjoin the audit and payment of these increases to the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives before December 30, 1969.

Petitioners argued that under Article VI, Section 14 of the Constitution, the increases could not take effect until the expiration of the full terms of all members of the Senate and House who approved it. While the term of the House members who approved the Act expired on December 30, 1965, the term of the Senators elected in 1963 (who also participated in the approval) would not expire until December 30, 1969. Respondents contended that the House members elected in 1965 were entitled to the increase as the term of their predecessors who approved the law had already expired.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has legal standing to file the suit.
2. W/N the salary increase under R.A. No. 4134 can take effect for members of the House of Representatives before December 30, 1969.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Taxpayers may bring an action to restrain officials from wasting public funds through the enforcement of an invalid or unconstitutional law.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the salary increases are not operative until December 30, 1969. Article VI, Section 14 of the Constitution provides: "No increase in said compensation shall take effect until after the expiration of the full term of all the Members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives approving such increase." The Constitution treats the "Senate and the House" as a single unit for this purpose, evidenced by the use of the singular word "term" and the phrase "all the Members." The intent of the provision is to place a "legal bar" to legislators yielding to the temptation of increasing their own salaries, creating a deterrent by requiring a waiting period. Since the term of the Senators elected in 1963—who approved the increase—does not expire until December 30, 1969, the increase cannot take effect for any member of Congress until that date.

The writ of prohibition was **GRANTED**, and the items in R.A. No. 4642 authorizing the disbursement were declared void.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
*   **Bengzon, J.P., J. (Concurring):** The word "Congress" was not used because it dissolves every four years, while the Senate is a continuing body. The use of "all" implies the increase cannot take effect until the term of the most junior Senator approving it has expired.
*   **Zaldivar, J. (Concurring):** Recalled the 1940 Constitutional Convention deliberations, noting the intent was to ensure equal compensation for both Houses at the same time and to prevent any member from receiving an increase they approved during their term.
*   **Castro, J. (Concurring):** Emphasized the use of the conjunction "and" in the phrase "Senate *and* of the House," which signifies a joinder; the terms of both bodies must expire before the increase takes effect.
