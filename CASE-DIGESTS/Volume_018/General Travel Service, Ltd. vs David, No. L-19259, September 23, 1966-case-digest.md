I. CAPTION
GENERAL TRAVEL SERVICE, LTD. v. EDILBERTO Y. DAVID, personally and as Collector of Customs of the Manila International Airport, G.R. No. L-19259, September 23, 1966, 18 SCRA 59, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On August 25, 1961, SAS and KLM planes arrived at the Manila International Airport from Bangkok carrying eight packages owned by petitioner General Travel Service, Ltd. [1]. The cargo manifests and air waybills declared the shipment as "frozen goods" destined for Manila with specific local consignees [2, 3]. Respondent Collector of Customs Edilberto David ordered the unloading of the packages. Airline representatives objected, claiming the goods were erroneously brought to the Philippines and requested their return to the airport of origin [1].

Upon examination, the packages were found to contain highly dutiable commercial items (transistors, watches, etc.) instead of frozen goods [2]. Consequently, the Collector instituted seizure proceedings for violation of the Tariff and Customs Code regarding false declarations [2]. Petitioner filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to enjoin the seizure, arguing there was no "importation" as the goods were brought by mistake [2, 4]. The CFI dismissed the petition [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the packages were deemed "imported" into the Philippines, thereby justifying their seizure and forfeiture by the Collector of Customs.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the packages were imported. Under **Section 1202 of the Tariff and Customs Code**, "importation begins when the carrying vessel or aircraft enters the jurisdiction of the Philippines with the intention to unload therein" [6]. In this case, the cargo manifests and air waybills clearly indicated that the packages were destined for the Philippines, providing sufficient basis for the Collector to conclude they were imported [7]. The objective evidence of the manifests prevailed over the bare notice of "wrong shipment" served by the airlines [8].

Furthermore, **Section 2530** of the same Code subjects articles to forfeiture if imported on the strength of a false declaration [9]. Since there was indubitable proof that the goods were misdeclared as "frozen goods" when they were actually high-value items, the Collector had the power to order their seizure [10]. Finally, the Court held that the petitioner's remedy was not with the CFI, but by appeal to the Commissioner of Customs and subsequently the Court of Tax Appeals, which has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over seizure and confiscation cases [11].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [12].
