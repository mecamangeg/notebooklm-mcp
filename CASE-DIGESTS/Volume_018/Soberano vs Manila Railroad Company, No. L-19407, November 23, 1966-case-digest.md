I. CAPTION
JUANA SOBERANO and JOSE B. SOBERANO v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, THE BENGUET AUTO LINE, and SANTIAGO CACCAM, G.R. No. L-19407, November 23, 1966, 18 SCRA 733, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On March 8, 1955, petitioner Juana Soberano was a passenger on a bus operated by Benguet Auto Line (BAL), a subsidiary of respondent Manila Railroad Company (MRR), driven by Santiago Caccam. The bus hit an embankment and fell into a precipice in Baguio, causing Juana serious physical injuries and the loss of her cargo (eggs). Caccam pleaded guilty in the criminal case for double homicide and serious physical injuries through simple imprudence. Juana reserved her right to institute a separate civil action [1, 2].

Juana and her husband filed a civil suit for damages against MRR, BAL, and Caccam based on breach of contract (*culpa contractual*). MRR had previously paid some medical expenses and offered P5,000 in settlement, which petitioners rejected [2]. The trial court dismissed the complaint against the driver Caccam, ruled MRR liable, but denied moral damages and attorney's fees, awarding only P5,000 for loss of earning capacity plus specific expenses [3-6]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law regarding Caccam's dismissal and the adequacy of damages [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal of the complaint against the driver Caccam was proper.
2. W/N the petitioners are entitled to moral damages and attorney's fees.
3. W/N the amount of compensatory damages awarded by the trial court was adequate.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The dismissal was proper. First, the trial court could not declare Caccam in default *motu proprio* without a motion from the plaintiff [7]. Second, the action was predicated on *culpa contractual* (breach of contract). The driver, Caccam, was not a party to the contract of carriage; the contract was between the passenger and the common carrier (MRR/BAL). Consequently, the carrier's liability is direct and immediate under Art. 1733 of the Civil Code, while the driver cannot be held liable on the contract [8, 9].

2. **NO.** Moral damages in cases of breach of contract of carriage are recoverable only where the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith (Art. 2220, Civil Code). "Bad faith" refers to wanton, reckless, or oppressive conduct, or gross negligence amounting to malice [10]. The Court found that MRR did not act with malice, as evidenced by their payment of medical bills and offer of settlement [5, 11]. Attorney's fees were also correctly denied because the defendants did not compel the plaintiffs to litigate; rather, the plaintiffs rejected a valid settlement offer to pursue exorbitant claims [5]. Additionally, moral damages for physical injuries are recoverable only by the injured party, not by the spouse [4].

3. **NO.** The award was inadequate. The Supreme Court increased the indemnity for loss of earning capacity from P5,000 to P15,000. Medical testimony established that Juana suffered permanent disfigurement, vision defects, and jaw limitations that would adversely affect her occupation as a merchant [12-14]. The Court also awarded P600 for unpaid living expenses during her medical treatment in Quezon City and P45.36 for unrealized profits from the eggs destroyed during the accident [6, 14].

**Disposition:** Judgment modified. Respondents are ordered to pay additional sums for unpaid allowances, increased loss of earning capacity, and unrealized profits, with interest [15].
