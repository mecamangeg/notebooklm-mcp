I. CAPTION
LEON DEL ROSARIO v. HON. BIENVENIDO CHINGCUANGCO, PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF NUEVA ECIJA and TOMAS IMPERIO, G.R. No. L-25503, December 17, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Leon del Rosario was a leasehold tenant of respondent Tomas Imperio. In July 1963, the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) rendered a decision ordering Del Rosario's ejectment, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in 1965. When Imperio moved for execution, Del Rosario opposed, arguing he had a right of retention over the land until indemnified for improvements he made, citing Section 43 of Republic Act No. 1199 (Agricultural Tenancy Act). The CAR rejected this, ruling that the claim for indemnity could be determined later and did not bar the execution of the judgment. A writ of execution was issued, and Imperio took possession of the land on December 18, 1965. Del Rosario filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court issued a preliminary injunction on January 8, 1966, after the writ had already been implemented. Both parties subsequently filed petitions for contempt against each other.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the tenant must be indemnified for improvements before he can be dispossessed by a writ of execution.
2. W/N the respondents are liable for contempt for enforcing the writ.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the tenant's claim for one-half of the value of improvements must be "threshed out, determined and resolved" before he can be dispossessed. Under Section 43 of R.A. No. 1199, a tenant is entitled to indemnity for improvements upon termination of the relationship. Section 1, Rule 15 of the old CAR Rules specifically prohibited the issuance of a writ of execution until such indemnity was paid. Although the Agricultural Land Reform Code (R.A. No. 3844) later mandated the use of the Rules of Court (which lack this specific retention provision), the Supreme Court applied Rule 133, which allows the use of "former procedure" in pending cases if the new rules would work an injustice. Dispossessing the tenant without prior reimbursement would be unjust and contrary to the social justice policy of the law.

2. **NO.** Regarding the contempt charge against Imperio, the Court found that the writ of execution was implemented on December 18, 1965, before the Supreme Court issued its preliminary injunction on January 8, 1966. Thus, there was no violation of the Court's order. The Court also dismissed Imperio's contempt charge against Del Rosario's counsel regarding a typographical error in a case citation, deeming it a trivial mistake rather than a deception.

**Disposition:** The orders of the respondent court and the writ of execution are SET ASIDE. Respondents are ordered to restore petitioner to the landholding until his claim for improvements is determined. The petitions for contempt are DENIED.
