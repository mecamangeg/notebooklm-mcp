I. CAPTION
JUAN DE BORJA, et al. v. HON. EULOGIO MENCIAS, et al., G.R. No. L-20609, September 29, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners (De Borjas) obtained a money judgment for P46,210.78 against respondent Crisanto de Borja in Civil Case No. 2414 [1, 2]. To satisfy the judgment, the sheriff levied on Crisanto's rights and participation in the estates of his deceased parents, Josefa Tangco and Francisco de Borja, which were pending settlement [2]. Respondent Judge Mencias initially ordered the sale of these rights, an order affirmed by the Supreme Court in a prior appeal (G.R. No. L-14851) [3, 4]. However, respondents moved for reconsideration, arguing that under Section 9, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court, the rights could only be sold after final settlement [5]. Consequently, Judge Mencias issued an amendatory order on May 19, 1962, instructing the sheriff to merely "garnish" the interests and wait for the estate's distribution, rather than proceed with the public sale [6]. Petitioners filed this action to set aside the amendatory order, claiming it illegally modified the final judgment in the previous appeal [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the rights and interest of a judgment debtor in a decedent's estate may be sold at public auction to satisfy a money judgment while the estate settlement is still pending.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the rights, interest, and participation of a judgment debtor in the estate left by his deceased parents may be sold at public auction to satisfy a money judgment rendered against him, even pending settlement [8]. However, the Court clarified that such a sale is subject to the *caveat* that it covers "only of whatever rights, interest and participation may be adjudicated to said heir as a result of the final settlement of the estates" [8]. Furthermore, the actual delivery of the sold interest to the judgment creditor or purchaser can only be effected "after the final settlement of the estates" and in the manner provided by Section 9, Rule 57 [8]. The petition was granted, and the lower court was directed to proceed with the sale subject to these conditions [8, 9].
