I. CAPTION
FIREMAN'S FUND INSURANCE COMPANY v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-21413, September 23, 1966, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Fireman's Fund Insurance Company filed a suit for sum of money against Manila Port Service (arrastre operator) and Manila Railroad Company for lost and damaged goods. The defendants operated under a Management Contract with the Bureau of Customs. Paragraph 15 of said contract relieved the Contractor of liability unless a suit was brought within one year from discharge or rejection of claim, *provided* that a claim for value was filed with the Contractor within 15 days from the discharge of the last package.

The plaintiff did not file a claim directly with the defendants. Instead, it filed provisional claims with the shipping companies and merely furnished the defendants with copies of these claims within the 15-day period. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the plaintiff, holding that furnishing copies of the claims constituted sufficient compliance with the Management Contract. The defendants appealed, arguing the claims were not filed "with the Contractor" as required.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the provisional claims filed with shipping companies, copies of which were furnished to the arrastre operator, satisfy the requirement of filing a claim with the Contractor.
2. W/N the action is barred by the failure to file a claim within the 15-day period.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the clear intendment of Paragraph 15 is that a claim must be filed directly with and against the contractor in unequivocal terms to place it on notice that the claimant intends to hold it liable. The provisional claims in this case were directed against the shipping companies for carrier liability (short-landing or bad order), matters not within the responsibility of the arrastre contractor. Thus, the defendants rightfully disregarded the copies as they did not constitute claims filed with and against them.

2. **YES.** The filing of a claim within the 15-day period is a condition precedent to the contractor's liability. Citing *Tomas Grocery v. Delgado Brothers* and *Consunji v. Manila Port Service*, the Court ruled that if no claim is filed within the 15-day period, the action cannot prosper, even if filed within one year. Since the plaintiff failed to file a valid claim with the defendants, the condition precedent was not met.

The judgment of the lower court is reversed and the complaint is dismissed.
