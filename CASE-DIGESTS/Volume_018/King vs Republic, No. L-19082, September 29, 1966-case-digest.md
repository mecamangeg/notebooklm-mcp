I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. CASIANO KING v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-19082, September 29, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Casiano King, born in Manila in 1933 and residing there since birth, filed a petition for naturalization. To support his petition, he presented two character witnesses, Angelina Baluyut and Dr. Jose Velasco, who came to know him only in 1939 and 1947, respectively. Regarding his financial capacity, King claimed an annual income of approximately P10,000.00 as a sales supervisor, which included a basic monthly salary of P500.00 and significant bonuses and commissions. The Court of First Instance of Manila denied the petition on the ground that the witnesses did not sufficiently prove that King conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during the "entire period of his residence" in the Philippines [1]. King appealed, arguing that the law only requires witnesses to attest to the statutory 5 or 10-year residence period, not his entire life [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the character witnesses were competent to attest to the petitioner's good conduct as required by law.
2. W/N the petitioner satisfied the requirement of a lucrative trade or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that under Section 2, paragraph 3, and Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law, an applicant must prove good moral character and irreproachable conduct "during the entire period of his residence in the Philippines" [3]. Character witnesses must act as "insurers of the latter's conduct and behaviour" and must have known the petitioner during this entire period. Since King was born in 1933 but his witnesses only knew him starting 1939 and 1947, they were not in a position to vouch for his conduct for the entire period required by law, rendering the petition defective (*Lim v. Republic; Ng v. Republic*) [2].

2. **NO.** The Court found that King's income tax return showed a fixed salary/allowance of P5,165.00 and bonuses/commissions of P5,000.00. The Court ruled that bonuses and commissions are excluded from the computation of lucrative income because "they are contingent, speculative and precarious" (*Tse v. Republic*) [4]. Without these inclusions, his income of P5,165.00 is not considered lucrative for a married applicant with one child to support, as even P6,300.00 had been previously declared insufficient (*Tan v. Republic*) [4].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Concepcion, C.J., and Makalintal, J., concurred in the result [5].
