I. CAPTION
CO PEK, LIM WUN CHEE, ET AL. v. HON. MARTINIANO VIVO, Acting Commissioner of Immigration, G.R. No. L-21775, December 17, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On November 28, 1960, Lim Wun Chee and her minor children applied for non-immigrant passport visas in Hong Kong to visit their husband/father, Co Pek, a permanent resident in Manila [1]. Lim Wun Chee executed an affidavit stating they would stay only for three months and would never apply for a change of status [1]. They arrived on December 16, 1960, and Co Pek posted a P30,000 cash bond [1]. On February 8, 1961, Co Pek’s naturalization application was granted by the CFI of Manila [2]. The family's stay was extended until 1963 based on a Cabinet Policy, which was later nullified in January 1962 [2, 3]. Consequently, the Commissioner of Immigration ordered them to leave by September 1962 [3].

The petitioners filed a prohibition case with the CFI of Manila to enjoin the deportation and confiscation of the bond [3]. During the pendency of the case, Co Pek took his oath of allegiance as a Filipino citizen [3]. The CFI granted the petition, declaring the wife and children Filipino citizens by reason of Co Pek's naturalization and ordering the refund of the bond [4]. The Commissioner appealed [4]. During the appeal, the petitioners manifested that they had voluntarily left and re-entered as quota immigrants, rendering the case academic, but the Supreme Court opted to decide the case in the interest of justice [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the wife of a naturalized Filipino automatically becomes a Filipino citizen upon his naturalization.
2. W/N foreign-born minor children admitted as temporary visitors are considered "dwelling in the Philippines" for automatic citizenship under the Revised Naturalization Law.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization Law (Com. Act No. 473), a wife shall be deemed a citizen only if she "might herself be lawfully naturalized" [6]. This phrase means she must not only be free of disqualifications but must also possess all the qualifications for acquiring Philippine citizenship [7]. The husband's naturalization does not *ipso facto* make her a citizen [7, 8]. Here, while Lim Wun Chee might not be disqualified, there was no proof she possessed all qualifications [7].

2. **NO.** The requirement in Section 15 that foreign-born minor children be "dwelling in the Philippines" at the time of the parent's naturalization means they must have a domicile or permanent residence in the country [9, 10]. Petitioners were admitted as temporary visitors with a specific representation that they would stay for a limited time and not change their status [11]. The Court held that an alien who gains admission via false pretenses or voluntary representation of temporary stay cannot subsequently claim a right to permanent admission without first departing [12, 13]. Their stay was obtained through fraud to satisfy Co Pek's naturalization requirements regarding children's schooling [14, 15].

The decision of the lower court is **REVERSED** and set aside [16].
