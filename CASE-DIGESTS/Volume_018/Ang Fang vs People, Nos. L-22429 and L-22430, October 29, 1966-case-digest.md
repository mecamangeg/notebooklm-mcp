**I. CAPTION**
**ANG FANG and ANG KIM TIAO v. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. Nos. L-22429 and L-22430, October 29, 1966, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
In March 1955, petitioner Ang Fang, an importer, and his cousin/employee Ang Kim Tiao, facilitated the importation of four bales declared as "joss papers" from Hong Kong [1, 2]. Due to reports of illegal importations, Customs authorities subjected the shipment to rigid inspection [3]. While the documents (bill of lading, commercial invoices) only declared "joss papers," the inspection revealed that the bales actually concealed 2,860 watches, various jewelry, and 170 tins of opium [3, 4].

Ang Kim Tiao had processed the release papers but failed to appear for the scheduled examination after being notified. Ang Fang also took no action to claim the goods after the release was refused [5, 6]. The Court of First Instance of Manila convicted both petitioners of fraudulent practice against customs revenues (Smuggling) under Section 2703 of the Revised Administrative Code and illegal importation of prohibited drugs under Article 192 of the Revised Penal Code [7]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty for the smuggling charge [8]. Petitioners appealed, claiming they were ignorant of the clandestine shipment and blamed the shipper [9].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N petitioners are criminally liable for smuggling and illegal importation despite their claim of lack of knowledge regarding the undeclared goods.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court rejected the defense of ignorance, holding that it would be "sheer naiveté" to believe the petitioners were victims of a plot [6]. The Court reasoned that import documents will naturally not declare smuggled goods to escape detection [9]. Furthermore, a shipper would not risk sending valuable contraband like watches and opium without a secret understanding with the local importer, lest they lose the goods entirely [9].

The Court also noted that the petitioners' conduct—specifically their failure to attend the inspection despite notice and their lack of effort to inquire why the goods were not released—was inconsistent with the behavior of innocent consignees [6].

The petition was **DENIED**. The judgment of the Court of Appeals was **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**, increasing the minimum term of the indeterminate penalty for the violation of Section 2703 of the Revised Administrative Code to one (1) year [10].
