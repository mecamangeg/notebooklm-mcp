I. CAPTION
NARCISO DEL ROSARIO v. HON. JUDGE YATCO, PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF BULACAN and ISABELO DE CHANGCO, G.R. No. L-18735, December 29, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On June 16, 1955, respondent Isabelo de Changco obtained a judgment for a sum of money against petitioner Narciso del Rosario in Civil Case No. 2869 [1]. On February 10, 1956, a writ of execution was issued, and a notice of levy was annotated on Del Rosario's property (TCT No. 4853) shortly thereafter [1, 2]. Years later, on June 14, 1961, Del Rosario filed a petition to cancel the notice of levy, arguing that since more than five years had elapsed since the entry of judgment without an execution sale taking place, the judgment was barred and could only be enforced by an ordinary action [3].

The lower court denied Del Rosario’s petition and granted Changco sixty (60) days to proceed with the sale of the levied properties [2]. Del Rosario filed a petition for certiorari with injunction, contending that the execution sale could no longer legally take place after the five-year period [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an execution sale may validly be held after the lapse of the five-year period for execution, provided the levy was made within said period.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court limits the time within which a writ of execution may be issued to five years, it does not prescribe a period for the actual sale at public auction [4]. Citing *Government of the Philippines v. Echaus* and *Quiambao v. Manila Motor Co., Inc.*, the Court ruled that a valid execution and levy made within the statutory period may be enforced by a sale thereafter [4]. The levy is the essential act by which the property is set apart for the satisfaction of the judgment and taken into the custody of the law [5]. Once the property is validly taken from the defendant within the period, his interest is limited to its application to the judgment, irrespective of when the sale takes place [5].

Petition dismissed; writ of preliminary injunction dissolved [6].
