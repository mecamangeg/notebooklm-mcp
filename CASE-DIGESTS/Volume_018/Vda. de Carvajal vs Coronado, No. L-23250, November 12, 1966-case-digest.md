I. CAPTION
NATIVIDAD TRINIDAD VDA. DE CARVAJAL v. MARIA NATIVIDAD FLORENCIA CORONADO, et al., G.R. No. L-23250, November 12, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Januario Coronado owned a parcel of land in Manila covered by TCT No. 22035. Due to tax delinquency, a portion of the land (161.24 sq. m.) was sold at a public auction in November 1930 to the petitioner, Natividad Trinidad Vda. de Carvajal [1]. Januario failed to redeem the property within the one-year period [2]. Petitioner immediately took possession and paid real estate taxes until 1952 [2].

However, the tax sale was not annotated on the certificate of title. In 1954, the respondents (heirs of Coronado) secured the cancellation of TCT No. 22035 and the issuance of a new title in their names, which included the portion already sold to the petitioner [2]. Through subsequent transfers, the property was eventually registered solely under respondent Maria Natividad Florencia Coronado [3]. Petitioner filed a complaint for reconveyance, alleging that the respondents acted in bad faith and had full knowledge of the tax sale [4].

Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing it failed to state a cause of action because the tax sale was not registered as required by Section 77 of the Land Registration Act [5]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiff has a cause of action despite the failure to register the tax sale under the Land Registration Act.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the order of dismissal.

While Section 77 of the Land Registration Act requires the registration of tax sales to bind third parties and start the one-year redemption period, the Court held that the strict requirement of registration does not apply when the party to be affected has actual knowledge of the sale [7]. The purpose of registration is merely to serve as notice; thus, actual knowledge is equivalent to registration [8].

The Court emphasized that the Torrens system protects only titleholders in good faith and cannot be used as a shield for fraud [9]. Since the complaint specifically alleged that the respondents had actual knowledge of the 1930 tax sale and the petitioner's possession before they secured their new titles in 1954, a valid cause of action exists [10]. Owners cannot be allowed to let years pass and then rely on the lack of registration to reacquire property sold for taxes to the prejudice of a purchaser in possession [11].

The order of the trial court dismissing the case was **REVERSED** and the case was remanded for further proceedings [12].
