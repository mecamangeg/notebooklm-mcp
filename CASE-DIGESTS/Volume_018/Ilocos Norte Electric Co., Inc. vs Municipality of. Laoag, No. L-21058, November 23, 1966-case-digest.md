I. CAPTION
ILOCOS NORTE ELECTRIC COMPANY, INC. v. MUNICIPALITY OF LAOAG and MUNICIPAL TREASURER OF LAOAG, G.R. No. L-21058, November 23, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Ilocos Norte Electric Company, Inc. (Company) operates an electric plant in Laoag, Ilocos Norte, under a municipal franchise granted pursuant to Act No. 3636. Under this franchise, the Company pays a franchise tax of 2% of its gross earnings "in lieu of any and all taxes" [1]. On September 29, 1960, the Municipality of Laoag enacted Ordinance No. 20, series of 1960, imposing an annual tax of P800.00 on persons engaged in the business of supplying electricity [2]. The Company paid P1,200.00 under protest and filed a suit to declare the ordinance void and recover the amount paid, arguing that the ordinance impaired the obligation of its contract/franchise [2]. The Municipality defended its power to tax under the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. No. 2264) [2]. The Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte ruled in favor of the Company, declaring the ordinance null and void [3]. The Municipality appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipality of Laoag may impose an additional tax on an electric power company that is already subject to a franchise tax, invoking the Local Autonomy Act.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, declaring the ordinance null and void [4].

The Court applied the doctrine laid down in *Butuan Sawmill, Inc. v. City of Butuan* (G.R. No. L-21516), which harmonized Sections 2(d) and 2(j) of the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. No. 2264). While Section 2(d) seemingly allows local governments to tax electric light, heat, and power utilities by excepting them from the prohibition on taxing public utilities, Section 2(j) explicitly prohibits the imposition of taxes of any kind on "persons paying franchise tax" [5, 6].

The Court held that the logical construction of the law is that local governments may only tax electric light and power utilities that are *not* subject to franchise taxes, unless the franchise itself specifically authorizes additional taxation [6]. Since Ilocos Norte Electric Company, Inc. is already subject to a franchise tax under Act No. 3636, the Municipality is without power to impose the additional tax provided in Ordinance No. 20 [1, 6].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [4].
