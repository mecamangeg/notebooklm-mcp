**I. CAPTION**
PEDRO R. PALTING v. SAN JOSE PETROLEUM INCORPORATED, G.R. No. L-14441, December 17, 1966, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent San Jose Petroleum, Inc. (SJP), a corporation organized in Panama, filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell voting trust certificates representing its capital stock in the Philippines [1, 2]. The proceeds were intended to finance San Jose Oil Company, Inc. (SJO), a domestic mining corporation 90% owned by SJP [2, 3]. SJP is majority-owned by Oil Investments, Inc. (Panama), which in turn is wholly owned by Pantepec Oil Company and Pancoastal Petroleum Company, both Venezuelan corporations [3]. Petitioner Pedro R. Palting, as a "prospective investor," filed an opposition, arguing that the tie-up between SJP and SJO violated the Constitution, the Petroleum Act, and the Corporation Law, and that the offering was fraudulent [4]. The SEC denied the opposition and granted the registration [5]. SJP challenged Palting's standing to appeal, arguing he was not an "aggrieved party," and claimed the issue was moot as the registration had already taken effect [6, 7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N Palting has legal personality to appeal the SEC order.
2. W/N SJP is a business enterprise entitled to parity rights under the Constitution and Laurel-Langley Agreement.
3. W/N the sale of SJP’s securities is fraudulent or contrary to law.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** Palting has standing to appeal. While the Old Rules of Court required an appellant to be an "aggrieved" party, Section 1, Rule 43 of the Revised Rules of Court permits "any party" to appeal a final order of the SEC [8]. Palting filed an opposition pursuant to the notice published by the SEC and actively participated in the hearings, thereby becoming a party to the proceedings [8]. This interpretation aligns with "Blue Sky Laws" designed to protect prospective investors [8].

2. **NO.** SJP is not entitled to parity rights. Under the Parity Amendment and the Laurel-Langley Agreement, the privilege to exploit natural resources is extended to business enterprises owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by citizens of the United States [9, 10]. SJP is not owned *directly* by US citizens, as it is owned by a Panamanian corporation [11]. It is not owned *indirectly* by US citizens because its parent company is owned by two Venezuelan corporations [11]. Even if the stockholders of the Venezuelan entities were Americans, SJP failed to prove that their respective US states grant reciprocal rights to Filipinos [12]. The Court held that stretching "indirect" ownership through a long chain of intervening foreign corporations strains the intent of the law and makes determining the citizenship of controlling stock a practical impossibility [13, 14].

3. **YES.** The sale of securities is fraudulent. SJP's Articles of Incorporation contain provisions violative of the Philippine Corporation Law, such as allowing directors who are not shareholders and relieving directors/officers of responsibility for contracts in which they have a personal interest [15, 16]. These provisions, combined with a voting trust agreement that completely disassociates stockholders from management, would work or tend to work fraud upon Philippine investors [17, 18].

**Disposition:** Orders set aside; case remanded to Securities and Exchange Commission for further proceedings [19].
