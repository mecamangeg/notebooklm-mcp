I. CAPTION
FELICISIMA BALLECER and JOSE S. AGAWIN v. JOSE BERNARDO, THE HON. JESUS P. MORFE, Presiding Judge, Branch XIII of the Court of First Instance of Manila, and the SHERIFF OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-21766, September 30, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On May 4, 1960, petitioners Ballecer and Agawin filed a civil case against respondent Bernardo to recover damages and possession of a 0.80-square-meter portion of their lot, alleging Bernardo encroached upon it by building a wall. Bernardo filed an answer denying the allegations and interposed a counterclaim, arguing that the petitioners were actually the ones who encroached upon 3.70 square meters of his property.

On the last day to answer the counterclaim, petitioners filed an *ex parte* urgent motion for extension of time, citing inability to contact counsel due to a typhoon. The trial court denied the motion for failing to set it for hearing, declared petitioners in default on the counterclaim, and allowed Bernardo to present evidence *ex parte*. The court subsequently rendered judgment on the counterclaim ordering petitioners to vacate and pay damages. After their motions for reconsideration and relief from judgment were denied and a writ of execution was issued, petitioners filed this original action for certiorari.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court gravely abused its discretion in declaring petitioners in default for failing to file an answer to the counterclaim.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the lower court committed a grave abuse of discretion. First, a motion for extension of time to file an answer may be heard and granted *ex parte* (*Moya v. Barton*). Second, and more importantly, the issues raised in the counterclaim (that petitioners encroached on Bernardo) were inseparable from the issues posed in the complaint (that Bernardo encroached on petitioners). The counterclaim was based on facts already controverted by the allegations in the complaint.

The Court held that where the issues in the counterclaim are inseparable from those in the complaint, it is not absolutely necessary for the plaintiff to file an answer thereto (*Arejola v. Cayetano*; *Rosario v. Martinez*). As stated in *Navarro v. Bello*, requiring an answer would merely force the plaintiffs to replead facts already alleged. Since the allegations were deemed controverted by the complaint itself, there was no occasion for default.

The petition is granted; the orders declaring default, the judgment on the counterclaim, and the writs of execution are annulled and set aside.
