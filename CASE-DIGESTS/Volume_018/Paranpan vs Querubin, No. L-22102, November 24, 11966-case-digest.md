I. CAPTION
JUAN PARANPAN v. HON. PERFECTO B. QUERUBIN, HON. JESUS S. RODRIGUEZ, HON. WENCESLAO L. FERNAN, and TERESA B. BUENDIA, G.R. No. L-22102, November 24, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
In the 1959 general elections for Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo, Augusto Araneta was elected Mayor, and respondent Teresa Buendia was elected as the third-ranking municipal councilor [1]. On September 13, 1963, the incumbent Mayor, Vice-Mayor, and the two highest-ranking councilors filed certificates of candidacy for other offices, resulting in their permanent resignation [1]. Respondent Buendia, being the next ranking councilor, claimed the office of Municipal Mayor under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 2264 and took her oath [2]. On the same day, President Diosdado Macapagal designated petitioner Juan Paranpan as Acting Mayor [2, 3].

Buendia filed a case for injunction against Paranpan in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo [3]. Respondent Judge Querubin issued a writ of preliminary injunction *ex parte* enjoining Paranpan from assuming office [3]. Paranpan’s subsequent motions to dissolve the writ were denied by respondent Judges Rodriguez and Fernan [3]. Paranpan filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [4]. During the pendency of the case, the November 11, 1963 general elections were held, and a new Mayor assumed office on January 1, 1964 [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition to determine the rightful successor to the office of Municipal Mayor has become moot.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court took judicial notice that a new set of municipal officials was elected in the November 11, 1963 general elections and that the duly elected Mayor assumed office on January 1, 1964 [5]. Consequently, respondent Buendia ceased to occupy the contested office, and there was no longer a vacancy that petitioner Paranpan could claim by virtue of his presidential appointment [5]. The Court ruled that where the disputed position is no longer vacant due to the assumption of office of the duly elected official, the question of succession becomes moot and academic [5-7].

The petition is **DISMISSED** [8].
