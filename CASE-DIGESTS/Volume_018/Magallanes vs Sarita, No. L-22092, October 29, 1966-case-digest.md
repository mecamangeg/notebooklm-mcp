I. CAPTION
ANTONIO MAGALLANES v. HEIRS OF LEON SARITA, G.R. No. L-22092, October 29, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Antonio Magallanes filed a special civil action for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) to enjoin the Director of Lands and Leon Sarita from enforcing an administrative decision awarding half of a disputed lot to Sarita. Sarita answered the original petition but failed to file an answer to the amended petition. Consequently, the CFI declared Sarita in default and rendered judgment declaring Magallanes the absolute owner of the land and the administrative decisions void.

After the judgment became final, the CFI granted Magallanes’ motion for execution and issued a writ of possession. Sarita moved to quash the writ. The CFI subsequently set aside the writ of possession, ruling it improper. Magallanes appealed, arguing that Sarita had no standing due to the default and that the writ was valid.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent had standing to move to quash the writ despite being declared in default.
2. W/N a writ of possession may be issued to enforce a judgment in a special civil action for prohibition.
3. W/N the respondents are liable for contempt for disobeying the writ.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under the Rules of Court (Section 3, Rule 11), an answer filed before an amendment stands as an answer to the amended complaint. Sarita’s failure to file a new answer did not put him in default, as default arises only upon failure to answer on time, not merely for failure to appear at the hearing. Thus, Sarita did not lose his standing in court and had the right to move to quash the writ [1].

2. **NO.** A writ of possession is justified only where the action is for the recovery of possession over real property, not in an action for prohibition [2]. A judgment in a special civil action for prohibition is classified as a special judgment under Section 9, Rule 39 (formerly Rule 69), enforced by serving a certified copy of the judgment upon the person concerned [3, 4]. The function of prohibition is to prevent the exercise of power without jurisdiction; an execution like a writ of possession is foreign to this function and void [4].

3. **NO.** Disobedience to an unlawful writ does not constitute contempt of court because no one can be bound by a void writ [5].

The orders of the lower court setting aside the writ of possession are **AFFIRMED** [5].
