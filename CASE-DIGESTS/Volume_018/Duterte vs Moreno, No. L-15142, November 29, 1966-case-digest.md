I. CAPTION
RAMON DUTERTE, ET AL. v. FLORENCIO MORENO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15142, November 29, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were the incumbent Mayor of Cebu City and various officers and employees of the Osmeña Waterworks System. The employee-petitioners had been appointed by the Secretary of Public Works and Communications. However, in July 1956, then Mayor Sergio Osmeña, Jr. issued new appointments to them pursuant to Section 21 of the Cebu City Charter (Commonwealth Act No. 58), purportedly superseding their previous appointments. The Commissioner of Civil Service and the Executive Secretary disapproved the Mayor's appointments. Consequently, the Auditor General suspended the payment of their salaries. Petitioners filed an action to compel the national authorities to approve the appointments and pay their salaries. The lower court ruled against the petitioners regarding the appointing power but declared them entitled to salaries for services rendered.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the City Mayor of Cebu has the power to appoint the officers and employees of the Osmeña Waterworks System.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The power to appoint officers and employees of the Osmeña Waterworks System is lodged in the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, not the City Mayor.

The Court held that Section 21 of the Cebu City Charter, which empowers the Mayor to appoint city employees, applies only if the appointment is "not otherwise provided for by law." Under Section 30 of the Charter, the City Engineer has custody of the waterworks. Commonwealth Act No. 424 places city engineers under the supervision of the Director of Public Works and provides that their subordinates be appointed in accordance with existing laws governing the Bureau of Public Works. Applying *Morales v. City Engineer of the City of Cavite*, the controlling provision is Section 79(d) of the Revised Administrative Code, which vests the power to appoint subordinate officers in the Department Head (Secretary of Public Works). Additionally, Act 2009 gives the Director of Public Works exclusive charge over the Osmeña Waterworks System.

The decision was affirmed with the modification that the City of Cebu is liable for the back salaries of the employees for services actually rendered, based on equity and prior jurisprudence holding cities liable even if not originally impleaded.
