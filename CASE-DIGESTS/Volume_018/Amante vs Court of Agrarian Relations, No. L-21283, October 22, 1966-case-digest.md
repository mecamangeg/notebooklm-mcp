I. CAPTION
ADRIANO AMANTE v. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, 6th Regional District, and SERGIO PAMA, G.R. No. L-21283, October 22, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Adriano Amante is the landowner of a tract of land in Buhi, Camarines Sur, cultivated by respondent Sergio Pama as a tenant. On May 28, 1962, Amante forcibly ousted Pama. Pama subsequently filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) for reinstatement and reliquidation of harvest [1]. Amante claimed that under a compromise agreement dated December 14, 1960, he was entitled to repossess the land after one year from June 1961 [2].

The CAR set the hearing for September 18, 1962. On the eve of the hearing (September 17), Amante’s counsel filed a motion for postponement, alleging he was just hired that day and had a conflict in another court. Neither Amante nor his counsel appeared at the scheduled hearing. The CAR denied the postponement, heard Pama's evidence, and rendered a decision ordering Pama's reinstatement [3, 4]. Amante appealed, challenging the denial of the postponement and the decision on the merits.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court abused its discretion in denying the motion for postponement.
2. W/N the tenant was validly dispossessed based on the expiration of the tenancy contract or the compromise agreement.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Motions for postponement are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent abuse of authority. There was no abuse of discretion because the petitioner’s failure to have counsel present was due to his own unjustified inaction and negligence; he was served notice of the hearing two months prior (July 17) but only engaged counsel on the eve of the trial [5, 6].

2. **NO.** A landlord cannot take the law into his own hands by forcibly ejecting a tenant. Even assuming the compromise agreement was valid, it was not submitted for court approval until six months after the ouster and was ultimately denied approval [7]. Furthermore, the expiration of a tenancy contract period does not extinguish the tenancy relationship (Section 9, R.A. No. 1199, as amended). Under Section 49 of R.A. No. 1199, a tenant may only be dispossessed for cause and only after the dispossession is authorized by the court [8].

The petition is DENIED and the decision affirmed. Treble costs are imposed on the petitioner for filing a manifestly frivolous appeal [9].
