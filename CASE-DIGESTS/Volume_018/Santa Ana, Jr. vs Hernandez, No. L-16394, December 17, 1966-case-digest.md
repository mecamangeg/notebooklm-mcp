**I. CAPTION**
JOSE SANTA ANA, JR. and LOURDES STO. DOMINGO v. ROSA HERNANDEZ, G.R. No. L-16394, December 17, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners, spouses Santa Ana, owned a parcel of land in Bulacan. On May 28, 1954, they sold two separate portions to respondent Hernandez for a lump sum of P11,000.00. The deed of sale described the boundaries of the lots and stated their areas as 12,500 sqm and 26,500 sqm, respectively, qualified by the phrase "more or less" (*humigit kumulang*). Hernandez occupied the land, but petitioners later claimed she was occupying an excess of 17,000 sqm beyond the area stated in the deed. Petitioners prepared a subdivision plan excluding the excess, which Hernandez refused to sign. Instead, Hernandez had a separate plan approved which matched her actual occupation defined by the boundaries.

Petitioners filed suit to recover the alleged excess area. The Court of First Instance (CFI) ruled in favor of petitioners, ordering Hernandez to vacate the excess. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the CFI, finding that the sale was for a lump sum and that the lots were identified by conspicuous boundaries (a long, continuous *pilapil* or dike). The CA declared Hernandez the owner of the entire area within the boundaries.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are binding on the Supreme Court.
2. W/N the contract was a sale for a lump sum (*corpus certum*), entitling the vendee to all the land within the boundaries regardless of the area stated in the deed.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The credibility of witnesses and weighing of conflicting evidence are within the exclusive authority of the Court of Appeals. Its factual findings are conclusive and not reviewable by the Supreme Court unless totally devoid of support in the record or glaringly erroneous. The CA found that the parties agreed to a lump sum price and identified the land by conspicuous boundaries.

2. **YES.** The transaction was a sale of a definite and identified tract (*corpus certum*) under Article 1542 of the Civil Code. The Court held that when real estate is sold for a lump sum and not at the rate of a certain sum for a unit of measure, the vendor is bound to deliver all the land included within the stated boundaries, even if the actual area exceeds that specified in the contract. The deed recited a single price of P11,000.00 for both lots, and the area was qualified as "more or less." The CA found the lots were separated from the rest of the property by a visible dike (*pilapil*), which served as the boundary. The Court also noted that Section 58 of Act 496 is merely a procedural directive for registration and does not modify the substantive rights of vendor and vendee under the Civil Code regarding sales *a cuerpo cierto*.

The petition is denied, and the decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
