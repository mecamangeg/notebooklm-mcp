I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE MILLING COMPANY, HECTOR A. TORRES and FRANCISCO M. GOMEZ v. CELSO LLOBREGAT, JULIAN C. SINGSON, and VILLAABRILLE & COMPANY, G.R. No. L-15090, October 29, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Defendants Singson and Llobregat were lessees of sugar plantations 30-5 and 30-6 adhered to the Mindoro Mill District, operated by petitioner Philippine Milling Company (PMC). PMC obstinately refused to recognize defendants as regular planters and refused to mill their cane, despite directives from the Sugar Quota Administration (SQA). Consequently, the planters obtained SQA permission to transfer their 60% "planter's share" of the sugar quota to another central. Later, they transferred the remaining 40% "mill share" to defendant Villa-Abrille & Co., a non-miller, based on a Department of Justice opinion allowing such assignment to any entity that would perform milling obligations. PMC filed suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to annul the transfers and claim damages. The CFI upheld the 60% transfer but declared the 40% transfer to Villa-Abrille void because the transferee was not a miller, and awarded damages to PMC. The defendants appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the planters could validly transfer the 40% "mill share" of the sugar quota to a non-miller despite the original miller's objection.
2. W/N the defendants are entitled to recover damages and attorney's fees from the plaintiffs.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the miller's right to the 40% share is based entirely on its contribution to the production of sugar. By obstinately and culpably refusing to mill the planters' cane, PMC is deemed to have waived its rights to the plantations' quota [1]. The splitting of the production allowance is a direct consequence of the division of resulting sugar based on respective contributions (cane and industry) [2]. To allow a miller who refuses to mill to retain the 40% share is unjust enrichment and would enable the miller to reduce the planter's marketing allotment (*Suarez v. Mt. Arayat Sugar Co.*) [1, 3]. To preserve their rights, the planters must be able to transfer the entire quota (100%) to another entity to secure milling services, regardless of whether the transferee is a miller or not [4].

2. **YES.** The Court found that plaintiffs obstinately ignored SQA directives, refused to manufacture sugar from the plantations, and filed suit to vindicate unfounded claims [5]. This compelled the planters to engage counsel to defend their interests. Under Article 2208 (11) of the Civil Code, the defendants are entitled to recover counsel fees and damages [6].

**Disposition:** The appealed judgment is MODIFIED. The transfer of the 40% mill share to Villa-Abrille & Co. is declared VALID; the award of damages to plaintiffs is ELIMINATED; and plaintiffs are ordered to pay defendants Llobregat and Singson P10,000 each in damages and counsel fees.
