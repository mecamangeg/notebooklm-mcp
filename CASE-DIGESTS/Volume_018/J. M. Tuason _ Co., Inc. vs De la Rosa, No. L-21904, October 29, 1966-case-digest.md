I. CAPTION
J. M. TUASON & CO., INC. v. EMILIO DE LA ROSA, G.R. No. L-21904, October 29, 1966, 18 SCRA 591, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff J. M. Tuason & Co. filed a suit to recover possession of a parcel of land in Quezon City covered by a Transfer Certificate of Title against defendant De la Rosa, who refused to vacate [1]. De la Rosa answered, claiming he was the rightful owner by virtue of "lawful titles" [2]. The trial was reset to February 9, 1961, at 8:30 A.M. upon defendant's motion [2].

On the scheduled date, neither defendant nor his counsel appeared. The trial court consequently issued an order delegating the reception of plaintiff's evidence to a commissioner (the Judicial Reporter) [2]. Defendant’s counsel arrived late and moved to set aside the order and the judgment rendered that same day, which ordered his eviction and payment of damages [3, 4]. The trial court denied the motion and the subsequent motion for reconsideration, noting the lack of an affidavit of merits [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court validly delegated the reception of evidence to a commissioner due to the defendant's non-appearance.
2. W/N the trial court correctly denied the motion to set aside the judgment despite the alleged excusable negligence of counsel.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that there was no irregularity in the order authorizing a commissioner to receive evidence. The commissioner merely took the evidence, a ministerial act involving no discretion, while the "all-important function—rendition of judgment" was performed personally by the judge [7, 8]. The Court cited Rule 34 (now Rule 33) of the Rules of Court, which sanctions such delegation when defendants fail to appear [8]. Furthermore, even if such delegation were an error, it was merely procedural and harmless, as it did not impair the substantial rights of the defendant or taint the proceedings with nullity [9].

2. **YES.** The denial was proper because the defendant failed to attach an affidavit of merits, a prerequisite under Section 2, Rule 37 of the Rules of Court [6, 10]. While the defendant's answer claimed ownership via "lawful titles," he failed to specify these titles or recite facts constituting legal possession under oath [10, 11]. To set aside a judgment, it is essential to show that a different result could reasonably be expected; otherwise, a reversal would be an "idle ceremony" [6, 12].

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [13].
