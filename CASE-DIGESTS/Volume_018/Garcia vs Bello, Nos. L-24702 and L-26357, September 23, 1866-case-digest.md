I. CAPTION
FABIAN GARCIA, ANATALIA GARCIA and BENJAMIN GARCIA v. HON. ELOY B. BELLO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan and PEDRO DE GUZMAN, G.R. Nos. L-24702 and L-26357, September 23, 1966, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Pedro de Guzman registered a tract of land in San Carlos, Pangasinan, in 1923 under the Torrens system (OCT No. 25381) [1]. In 1959, petitioners filed a case for reconveyance against De Guzman, which was dismissed on the grounds of *res judicata* and prescription; this dismissal was affirmed by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-15988 in 1962 [1]. Subsequently, De Guzman secured a writ of possession from respondent Judge Bello [1]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari (G.R. No. L-21355) to restrain the enforcement of the writ, but the Supreme Court dismissed this in April 1965, affirming the lower court's authority to issue the writ [2], [1].

Despite these rulings, Judge Bello issued an order on May 29, 1965, granting the writ of possession and giving petitioners 20 days to vacate [3]. Petitioners then filed the present petitions (L-24702 and L-26357), alleging grave abuse of discretion [2], [4]. They argued that the decision in L-21355 was not yet final due to a pending motion for reconsideration and claimed ownership of a 17-hectare portion of the land based on deeds of sale allegedly executed by De Guzman in favor of their father, Juan Garcia, in 1916 and 1938 [2], [5], [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge abused his discretion in issuing the writ of possession in favor of De Guzman. [7]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the writ of possession was proper because the question of ownership had already been finally determined in previous cases (L-15988 and L-21355) involving the same parties and subject matter [8].

The Court applied the doctrine of **res judicata**, stating that the decree of land registration in favor of De Guzman bars the petitioners' claims over the land [8]. Regarding the newly alleged deeds of sale for the 17-hectare portion, the Court ruled they were of no avail [6]. Petitioners' father, Juan Garcia, failed to oppose De Guzman's original registration application in 1918 or seek annulment before his death in 1950 [6]. Furthermore, the Court reiterated that even without the Torrens title, De Guzman would have acquired the land by **prescription**, precluding any action for recovery [8], [9].

The petitions were dismissed for being patently unmeritorious, with double costs imposed against the petitioners [10].
