I. CAPTION
ANGELINA MEJIA LOPEZ, AURORA MEJIA VILLASOR, and ROY P. VILLASOR v. THE CITY JUDGE, CESAR L. PARAS, TRINIDAD T. LAZATIN, and TERRA DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-25795, October 29, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Lopez and Villasor entered into a contract with respondent Trinidad Lazatin (later transferred to Terra Development Corporation) for the development of a subdivision. Subsequently, Lazatin and Terra filed a complaint for falsification of a private document against Petitioners in the City Court of Angeles. The information alleged that Petitioners falsified the contract by stating they were the guardians of minors George and Alexander Mejia, when they knew they were not.

Petitioners filed a motion to quash the information on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. They argued that the alleged act of falsification—the signing of the private document—occurred in Makati and Quezon City, outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Angeles City Court. The respondent City Judge denied the motion to quash. Petitioners then filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court to restrain the lower court from proceeding with the case.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City Court of Angeles has jurisdiction over the crime of falsification of a private document when the document was signed outside its territorial jurisdiction.
2. W/N the writs of certiorari and prohibition are proper remedies to challenge the denial of a motion to quash.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The City Court of Angeles lacks jurisdiction. Under Section 86 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, municipal courts have original jurisdiction only over criminal offenses committed within their respective territorial jurisdictions. The crime of falsification of a private document (Article 172, Par. 2, Revised Penal Code) is consummated at the time and place where the document is actually falsified with the intent to prejudice a third person, regardless of whether the document is later put to the illegal use for which it was intended (*U.S. v. Barretto*). Since the signing of the document and the coetaneous intent to cause damage occurred in Makati and Quezon City, the offense was consummated outside the territorial jurisdiction of Angeles City.

2. **YES.** While the general rule is that certiorari and prohibition will not issue to annul an order denying a motion to quash (the remedy being to go to trial and appeal upon conviction), this rule is not absolute. These extraordinary writs are intended to annul void proceedings and prevent the unlawful and oppressive exercise of legal authority. Where the court's lack of jurisdiction is patent, as in this case, the writs will issue to restrain the court from further proceedings to ensure the orderly administration of justice and prevent the accused from suffering the embarrassment and anguish of an unnecessary trial.

The petition is granted, and the City Court of Angeles is restrained and prohibited from further proceedings in the case.
