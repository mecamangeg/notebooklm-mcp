I. CAPTION
AMANCIO BALITE v. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21475, September 30, 1966, 18 SCRA 280, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
In December 1958, petitioner Amancio Balite proposed that a P10,000.00 donation from a copra exporter be given solely to the officers of the Democratic Labor Association. When Union President Delfin Mercader opposed this, Balite threatened to destroy the union and was subsequently expelled. On May 21, 1959, in Cebu City, Balite told members of the Marine Officers Guild that Mercader "sold the union," "swindled the money," "received bribe money," and was engaged in "racketeering" and "enriching himself with the capitalists."

Mercader filed a complaint for grave oral defamation with the City Fiscal. The Fiscal conducted a preliminary investigation, attested to the complaint, and filed it with the City Court of Cebu. The City Court convicted Balite. On appeal, the Court of Appeals modified the judgment by increasing the penalty. During the Supreme Court review, Mercader submitted an affidavit forgiving Balite and waiving all civil and criminal actions. Balite challenged the jurisdiction of the court and argued the crime had prescribed.

III. ISSUES
1. W/N the criminal action was properly commenced via a complaint filed by the Fiscal instead of an Information.
2. W/N the City Court of Cebu had jurisdiction over the case given the penalty for grave oral defamation.
3. W/N the crime committed was slight oral defamation and had prescribed.
4. W/N the affidavit of pardon by the offended party extinguished the petitioner's criminal and civil liability.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the commencement of the action complied with the rules. While Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code mandates that defamation imputing private crimes (adultery, etc.) must be brought upon complaint by the offended party, it does not prohibit the prosecution of defamation imputing public crimes (like *estafa*, as in this case) via a complaint filed by the Fiscal. The Fiscal investigated, found probable cause, and adopted the complaint as his own, satisfying the requirement that the fiscal direct the prosecution.

2. **YES.** Although the Cebu City Charter limited the City Court's jurisdiction to offenses punishable by up to 6 months imprisonment, Section 10 of Republic Act No. 2613, which took effect on August 1, 1959, expanded the jurisdiction of City Courts to include offenses punishable by imprisonment up to 6 years. Since the complaint was filed on August 29, 1959, and the penalty for grave oral defamation falls within this limit, the City Court had jurisdiction.

3. **NO.** The Court held that the crime was grave oral defamation, which had not prescribed. The defamatory words imputed serious crimes such as *estafa* ("swindling," "racketeering," "bribe") and were insulting in nature. Under the doctrine in *U.S. v. Lim San*, the averments characterize the crime. Since the offense was grave, the two-month prescriptive period for slight oral defamation did not apply.

4. **NO (Criminal); YES (Civil).** Pardon by the offended party does not extinguish the criminal act, except in private crimes specified in Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code. However, under Article 23 and Article 112 of the Revised Penal Code, express condonation by the offended party waives civil liability. Thus, Mercader's affidavit extinguished the monetary indemnity but not the prison sentence.

**Disposition:** The judgment is MODIFIED. Petitioner is sentenced to a prison term ranging from 4 months of *arresto mayor*, as minimum, to 1 year and 8 months of *prision correccional*, as maximum. The civil indemnity of P5,000.00 is deleted.
