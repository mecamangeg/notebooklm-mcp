I. CAPTION
NICEFORO S. AGATON v. HON. PATRICIO PEREZ, CARLOS S. MARTINEZ, and FELIZA B. MARTINEZ, G.R. No. L-19548, December 22, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On June 15, 1960, Petitioner Niceforo Agaton leased the second floor of Respondent Spouses Martinez's house in Baguio City. On May 8, 1961, Respondents filed a complaint in the Municipal Court of Baguio against Petitioner for unpaid rents and other debts [1]. Petitioner filed a written answer containing counterclaims, alleging that Respondents misrepresented the availability of transportation and that Respondent Feliza maliciously inquired about his salary at his workplace to humiliate him [2].

During the hearing, Respondents verbally denied the counterclaims, asserting their claim was filed in good faith. Petitioner then moved for judgment on the pleadings regarding his counterclaims, arguing that Respondents' verbal answer was a mere general denial that tendered no triable issue. The Municipal Court denied the motion. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance of Baguio alleging grave abuse of discretion, which was dismissed [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipal Court committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the motion for judgment on the pleadings regarding the counterclaims.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that Section 6, Rule 4 of the old Rules of Court does not require a written answer to a counterclaim in the Municipal Court [4, 5]. Furthermore, following the rule on new matters under Rule 11, Section 1 of the old Rules of Court, allegations in the counterclaims may be deemed controverted even if not specifically challenged in a reply [4].

The Court held that the Respondents specifically traversed the basic allegations of misrepresentation and malice by verbally alleging good faith in their answer to the counterclaims. Thus, the Municipal Court acted correctly and with proper judicial circumspection in denying the motion for judgment on the pleadings [4, 6].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [6].
