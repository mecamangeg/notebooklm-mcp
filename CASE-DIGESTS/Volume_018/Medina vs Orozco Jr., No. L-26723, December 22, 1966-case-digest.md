**I. CAPTION**
**ARTHUR MEDINA Y. YUMUL v. MARCELO F. OROZCO, JR., Acting City Warden of Caloocan City**, G.R. No. L-26723, December 22, 1966, 18 SCRA 1169, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Arthur Medina was arrested for murder on November 7, 1965. On November 10, 1965, an Information for murder was filed against him in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, and the court issued an order of commitment. Medina filed a petition for *habeas corpus*, arguing that his detention was illegal because: (1) he was arbitrarily detained beyond the 18-hour period prescribed by Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code before the Information was filed; (2) no preliminary investigation was conducted; and (3) he was deprived of his right to a speedy trial due to postponements [1, 2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petitioner should be released via *habeas corpus* due to the alleged arbitrary detention prior to the filing of the Information.
2. W/N the petitioner was denied his right to a speedy trial.
3. W/N the alleged lack of preliminary investigation warrants the petitioner's release.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** Even assuming the initial detention was arbitrary due to the lapse of the 18-hour period, the petitioner is currently detained under a valid judicial process. The Court held that detention under a valid information and a court-issued warrant of commitment is distinct from the arbitrary detention anterior to it. Once the Information is filed and the court orders the commitment of the accused, the detention becomes legal. *Habeas corpus* will not lie to release the accused after a warrant of commitment has been issued, regardless of defects in the initial arrest or detention [3, 4].

2. **NO.** The Court found that the delays in the arraignment and trial were primarily caused by the motions for postponement filed by the petitioner and his counsel. A delay of the accused's own making cannot be deemed oppressive or a violation of the constitutional right to a speedy trial [5].

3. **NO.** The petitioner failed to prove the absence of a preliminary investigation, and the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties prevails. Furthermore, the absence of a preliminary investigation does not affect the court's jurisdiction but only the regularity of the proceedings. This issue should be raised in the trial court, not in the Supreme Court via *habeas corpus*, and the right to it may be waived [4, 6].

**Petition denied.**
