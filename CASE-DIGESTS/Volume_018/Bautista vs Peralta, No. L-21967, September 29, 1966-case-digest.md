**I. CAPTION**
EDUARDO G. BAUTISTA v. GENERAL MACARIO PERALTA, JESUS G. PERLAS, OLEGARIO CANTOS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21967, September 29, 1966, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Eduardo G. Bautista, an employee of the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NWSA), was charged with dishonesty and violation of office regulations. He was placed under preventive suspension on May 30, 1958. The Civil Service Commission initially ordered his dismissal, but upon appeal, the Civil Service Board of Appeals modified the decision on May 13, 1963, reducing the penalty to a suspension of two months without pay, chargeable to his preventive suspension.

Despite the modification, NWSA reinstated Petitioner only on September 3, 1963, without paying his back wages for the five-year period he was suspended. Petitioner demanded payment of back salaries, living allowances, damages, and attorney's fees. Various government officials, including the Undersecretary of Public Works and Communications, had already ruled that Petitioner was entitled to back salaries. Petitioner filed a petition for mandamus with the Supreme Court to compel the respondents to pay the claimed amounts.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N a writ of mandamus lies to compel the payment of the petitioner's back salaries.
2. W/N a writ of mandamus lies to compel the payment of living allowances, damages, and attorney's fees.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the government's obligation to pay the back salaries is enforceable by mandamus. While money claims are ordinarily not enforceable by mandamus, the Petitioner's right in this case is clear. The penalty imposed was only two months of suspension, which was effectively served during the first two months of his five-year preventive suspension. Preventive suspension is not a penalty but a precautionary measure; if the employee is exonerated—or in this case, served a penalty lesser than the suspension period—reinstatement with back pay for the excess period is proper. To deny back salaries for the period exceeding the two-month penalty would inevitably increase the penalty imposed by the Board, which is not allowed. Furthermore, government officials had already recognized his right to back salaries pursuant to Section 260 of the Revised Administrative Code [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].

2. **NO.** The Court held that mandamus is not the proper remedy for the claims regarding living allowances, damages, and attorney's fees. There was nothing in the decision of the Civil Service Board of Appeals or the petition that showed a clear legal right to these specific items. These claims require an ordinary civil action where the right to and extent of recovery can be litigated and proved [6], [7], [8].

**Petition is GRANTED in part with respect to back salaries and DENIED with respect to other claims.**
