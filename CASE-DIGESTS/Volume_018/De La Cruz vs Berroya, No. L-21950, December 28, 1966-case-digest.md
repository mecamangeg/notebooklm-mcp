I. CAPTION
AMBROCIO DE LA CRUZ and PAULINA SIGURADO v. PRIMITIVA BERROYA and ELISA MANALO, G.R. No. L-21950, December 28, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On January 6, 1960, a jeepney owned by the respondents and driven by Igmidio Senin hit and killed the petitioners' child [1]. Senin was convicted of homicide through reckless imprudence and ordered to pay P6,000.00 in civil indemnity, but the writ of execution against him was returned unsatisfied [2]. Consequently, petitioners filed a civil case in the Court of First Instance of Manila to enforce the subsidiary civil liability of the respondent owners [1].

Respondents filed a Motion to Dismiss, presenting a "Release of Claim" document wherein petitioners, for a consideration of P750.00, released the driver and the transport company from all claims arising from the accident [3]. The lower court dismissed the complaint based on this release [4]. Petitioners appealed, arguing that release is not a ground for a motion to dismiss and that the defense was barred because it was not raised as a compulsory counterclaim in the criminal case against the driver [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the complaint for subsidiary liability was properly dismissed on the ground of release.
2. W/N the defense of release was barred for not being raised as a compulsory counterclaim in the criminal case.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that under Rule 16, Section 1(h) of the Rules of Court, "release" is a specific ground upon which a motion to dismiss may be based [5, 6]. Furthermore, the Court held that the release of the driver, who is the party primarily liable, necessarily implies the release of the owners who are only subsidiarily liable [7, 8]. Since the petitioners executed a valid document acknowledging payment and releasing the primary party, they cannot enforce subsidiary liability against the owners.

2. **NO.** The Court held that a release of claim is a matter of defense and is not in the nature of a compulsory counterclaim [7, 8]. Therefore, the respondents were not required to raise it in the criminal proceedings against the driver, and their failure to do so did not bar them from invoking it in the civil suit.

The order of dismissal is AFFIRMED [9].
