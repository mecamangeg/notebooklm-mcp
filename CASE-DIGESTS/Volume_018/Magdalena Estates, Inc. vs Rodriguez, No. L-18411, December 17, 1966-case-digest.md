I. CAPTION
MAGDALENA ESTATES, INC. v. ANTONIO A. RODRIGUEZ and HERMINIA C. RODRIGUEZ, G.R. No. L-18411, December 17, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Antonio and Herminia Rodriguez purchased a lot in Quezon City from Magdalena Estates, Inc., leaving an unpaid balance of P5,000.00. On January 4, 1957, they executed a promissory note for said amount with 9% interest per annum, payable within 60 days. When the obligation became due, Luzon Surety Co., Inc. paid Magdalena Estates the principal sum of P5,000.00 on June 20, 1958. Magdalena Estates subsequently demanded payment of P655.89 from the spouses representing the accumulated interest on the principal. The spouses refused to pay, arguing that Magdalena Estates' unqualified acceptance of the P5,000.00 from the surety, without reservation regarding the interest, extinguished their obligation via payment or novation. The Municipal Court of Manila ruled in favor of Magdalena Estates, and the Court of First Instance of Manila affirmed the decision.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the creditor's acceptance of the principal amount from the surety without reservation extinguished the principal debtors' obligation to pay accrued interest.
2. W/N the acceptance of the surety bond constituted a novation of the promissory note.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that there was no waiver or condonation of the interest due. The liability of the surety was strictly limited to the specific amount of P5,000.00 stated in the bond and could not be extended by implication [1]. Therefore, Magdalena Estates was entitled to accept the P5,000.00 as full compliance with the surety's undertaking, but could not apply any part of it to the interest [1]. The reliance on Article 1253 of the Civil Code (stating payment of principal shall not be deemed made until interests are covered) was misplaced because said article is merely directory, not mandatory [2], [1]. Furthermore, the rules on application of payment do not apply to a surety whose obligation is contingent and singular [2].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that novation did not occur. Novation by presumption is not favored and requires that the old and new obligations be incompatible on all points, or that the parties expressly agree to novate [3]. The surety bond was merely an accessory to the promissory note, not a new and separate contract incompatible with the original obligation [4]. The mere acceptance of payment from a third person (the surety) who agreed to assume the obligation does not release the principal debtor unless there is an express agreement to that effect [4].

Judgment affirmed.
