I. CAPTION
LEONARDO CABUDOL, PASTOR CABUDOL, DANIEL CABUDOL and JESUS CABUDOL v. HON. NUMERIANO G. ESTENZO, REMIGIO BACUNAL, and GENEROSA VENCESLAO-BACUNAL, G.R. No. L-21170, September 27, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Remigio and Generosa Bacunal filed a civil case against petitioners (the Cabudols) in the Court of First Instance of Ormoc City for the recovery of possession of a portion of Lot No. 10266 [1]. Petitioners claimed they were occupying Lot No. 10103, not the respondents' lot [2]. The parties entered into a compromise agreement to conduct a relocation survey, stipulating that the trespasser would pay the surveyor's fee and yield possession [2, 3]. The trial court rendered a decision based on this compromise [4].

The surveyor's report revealed that petitioners encroached on 5.3686 hectares of the respondents' lot [5]. Consequently, the trial court ordered petitioners to pay the surveyor and directed execution of the judgment [5]. Petitioners' motion for reconsideration and subsequent notice of appeal were denied for being filed out of time [6, 7]. Petitioners then filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Supreme Court [7]. However, during the pendency of the case, petitioners filed a manifestation in the lower court stating they had sold their lot, were moving to Mindanao, and were waiving their claims [8]. They subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the petition before the Supreme Court, signifying their lack of interest in prosecuting the case [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition has become moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the case had become academic because the petitioners signified their lack of interest to further prosecute the case and explicitly filed a motion to dismiss their petition [9, 10]. When a party voluntarily desists from pursuing the action and waives their claims, the issues raised cease to present a justiciable controversy. Accordingly, the petition was dismissed [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Dizon, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Sanchez and Castro, JJ., concurred) [10].
