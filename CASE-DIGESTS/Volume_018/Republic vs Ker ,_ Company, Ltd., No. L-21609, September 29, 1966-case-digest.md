**I. CAPTION**
**REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. KER & COMPANY, LTD.**, G.R. No. L-21609, September 29, 1966, 18 SCRA 207, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Ker & Company, Ltd. (Ker & Co.) filed its income tax returns for the years 1947 to 1950. In 1953, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) examined the books and issued deficiency income tax assessments [1]. Ker & Co. filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) on March 1, 1956, but the CTA dismissed it for being filed beyond the 30-day reglementary period. The Supreme Court affirmed this dismissal in 1962 [2].

On March 27, 1962, the Republic filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to collect the taxes [3]. Summons was served not on the corporation directly, but on its counsel, Leido and Associates, who handled the administrative proceedings [4]. Ker & Co. filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction over its person due to invalid service of summons and that the cause of action had prescribed. The CFI denied the motion. Ker & Co. then filed an answer raising the same defenses [4, 5]. The CFI eventually ruled that the 1947 tax claim had prescribed but ordered Ker & Co. to pay the deficiencies for 1948, 1949, and 1950. Both parties appealed [5, 6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the CFI acquired jurisdiction over the person of the defendant Ker & Co.
2. W/N the government’s right to assess deficiency income tax for 1947 has prescribed.
3. W/N the filing of the petition for review in the CTA suspended the running of the prescriptive period to collect taxes for 1948, 1949, and 1950.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The service of summons upon the counsel was valid. Under Section 13, Rule 7 (now Section 13, Rule 14) of the Rules of Court, service upon a domestic corporation may be made on its agent. Since the counsel represented Ker & Co. in the administrative stage and was still acting on its behalf when summons was served, they were considered the taxpayer's agent [7]. Furthermore, by interposing the affirmative defense of prescription in its motion to dismiss, Ker & Co. voluntarily submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the court, curing any defect in the service of summons [8, 9].

2. **YES.** The assessment for 1947 was issued on July 25, 1953, more than 5 years after the return was filed on April 12, 1948, violating Section 331 of the Tax Code [10]. The Republic claimed the return was fraudulent, which would allow a 10-year prescriptive period, but fraud was neither alleged in the complaint nor proved by clear and convincing evidence [11]. While the tax assessment had ostensibly become final, the Republic waived its right to object to the defense of prescription by litigating the issue on the merits before the lower court [12, 13].

3. **YES.** Under Section 333 of the Tax Code, the prescriptive period is suspended during the time the Commissioner is prohibited from instituting a proceeding in court [14]. The pendency of the taxpayer’s appeal in the CTA and the Supreme Court effectively stayed the hands of the Commissioner from filing a civil action to collect [15]. To hold otherwise would encourage taxpayers to delay payment by filing appeals, even if the court ultimately lacks jurisdiction, in the hope that the tax liability would prescribe [16].

**Disposition:** Judgment modified. The delinquency interest at the rate of 1% per month shall be computed from March 15, 1953 for the 1948 and 1949 taxes, and from February 15, 1954 for the 1950 tax [17].
