I. CAPTION
**NIELSON & COMPANY, INC. vs. LEPANTO CONSOLIDATED MINING COMPANY**, G.R. No. L-21601, December 17, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Nielson & Company, Inc. (Nielson) and Lepanto Consolidated Mining Company (Lepanto) executed a management contract on January 30, 1937, for a five-year period, later renewed in 1941 for another five years [1, 2]. The contract provided that in case of force majeure, such as war, the agreement would "remain in suspense" [3, 4]. In February 1942, during World War II, the mining properties were destroyed upon orders of the U.S. Army to prevent utilization by the invading Japanese forces [2, 5]. After the war ended in 1945, Lepanto took possession and rehabilitated the mines, officially resuming operations on June 26, 1948 [6, 7].

Nielson contended that the war suspended the contract and its term should be extended by the duration of the suspension [8]. Lepanto argued the contract expired in 1947 [8]. Despite Nielson's insistence on resuming management, Lepanto refused and took over operations exclusively [8, 9]. After prolonged negotiations and attempts at arbitration failed, Nielson filed a complaint in 1958 for damages and specific performance [10, 11]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint on the grounds of prescription and laches [12].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the management contract was extended for a period equivalent to the suspension caused by the war.
2. W/N Nielson's action is barred by prescription or laches.
3. W/N Nielson is entitled to management fees and a share in profits for the extension period despite not actually managing the mines.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The contract was suspended from February 1942 until June 26, 1948, and the term of the contract should be extended for a period equivalent to this suspension (60 months) [7, 13]. The Court ruled that the intention of the parties, as gleaned from the "suspense" clause and contemporaneous acts, was that suspension meant the extension of the contract term to enable the manager to perform the full period agreed upon [14, 15]. The Court cited the admission of Lepanto's own Board Chairman, C.A. DeWitt, who expressed the belief that the suspension provision or the law itself extended the contract [16, 17].

2. **NO.** On laches: The delay was justified by the protracted negotiations and arbitration attempts between the parties [11]. Laches is a doctrine of equity based on the inequity of permitting a claim to be enforced due to changes in conditions, while prescription is a matter of law based on fixed time [18]. On prescription: The action is based on a written contract (including unsigned Board minutes modifying profit sharing which constitute a written agreement) [19]. Under the Moratorium Law (Executive Order No. 32), the prescriptive period was suspended for over eight years; deducting this from the elapsed time, the ten-year prescriptive period for written contracts had not yet expired [20].

3. **YES.** Lepanto is liable for management fees and profit shares. Since Nielson insisted on performing its duties but was prevented by Lepanto, there was constructive fulfillment of the obligation under Article 1186 of the Civil Code [21]. Nielson is entitled to the management fee of P2,500.00 monthly for the 60-month extension period, as well as its 10% share in cash dividends, stock dividends, depletion reserves, and capital account expenses declared or incurred during said period [22-24].

The decision of the lower court is **REVERSED**. Lepanto is ordered to pay Nielson management fees, shares in dividends and reserves, and P50,000.00 in attorney's fees [22, 25].
