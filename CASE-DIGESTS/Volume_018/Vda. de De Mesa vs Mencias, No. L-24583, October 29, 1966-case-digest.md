I. CAPTION
MAGDALENA SIBULO VDA. DE MESA, et al. v. HON. EULOGIO MENCIAS, et al., G.R. No. L-24583, October 29, 1966, 18 SCRA 533, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Francisco De Mesa and Maximino Argana were candidates for Mayor of Muntinlupa, Rizal in the 1963 elections. De Mesa was proclaimed the winner and assumed office, with Demetrio Loresca elected as Vice-Mayor. Argana filed an election protest in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal presided by Judge Mencias. During the pendency of the protest, De Mesa was assassinated. By operation of law, Vice-Mayor Loresca succeeded him.

The trial court ordered De Mesa’s widow and children to substitute him, but they failed to appear. Consequently, the court declared them non-suited and allowed Argana to proceed *ex parte*, without appointing a legal representative for the deceased protestee as required by the Rules of Court. The CFI rendered judgment declaring Argana the winner. The widow and the local Liberal Party chapter sought to intervene and appeal, followed later by Vice-Mayor Loresca. The CFI and subsequently the Court of Appeals (CA) denied their pleas, with the CA ruling that the rule on substitution of parties does not apply to election cases.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N an election contest survives the death of the protestee.
2. W/N Section 17, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court regarding substitution of parties applies to election contests.
3. W/N the proceedings taken by the trial court *ex parte* without a legal representative for the deceased are valid.
4. W/N the Vice-Mayor is the proper legal representative to be substituted for the deceased protestee.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** An election contest involves public interest and must be prosecuted to final judgment despite the death of the protestee [1]. The protestee retains a party interest to keep his opponent out of office and maintain his successor, and the court retains jurisdiction to pursue the proceeding [2, 3].

2. **YES.** Although the Revised Election Code did not expressly provide for the contingency of a protestee's death, Rule 143 of the Rules of Court allows the Rules to be applied by analogy or in a suppletory character [1]. Therefore, Section 17, Rule 3, which governs the procedure for the death of a party, applies to election contests with the same force and effect as in ordinary civil actions [4].

3. **NO.** The trial court's failure to strictly adhere to Section 17, Rule 3 rendered the proceedings null and void [4]. The rule mandates that if the legal representative fails to appear, the court "may order the opposing party to procure the appointment of a legal representative." By ignoring this and proceeding *ex parte*, the court denied the deceased protestee due process and lost jurisdiction over the person [4, 5]. The *motu proprio* appointment of a commissioner for the revision of ballots was not substantial compliance, as the commissioner is an agent of the court, not a legal representative of the party [6].

4. **YES.** Upon the death of the mayor, the Vice-Mayor (Loresca) succeeded to the office by operation of law under the Local Autonomy Act [7]. He is the real party in interest to defend the deceased’s title to protect his own succession [8, 9]. The widow's interest was limited only to costs, and the political party lacked personality to sue [9]. Loresca was not guilty of laches because the court failed in its duty to order his substitution or notification [10].

**Disposition:** The judgment is REVERSED. The decision of the CFI is declared NULL and VOID. Protestant Argana is ordered to vacate the office in favor of Loresca. The CFI is ordered to appoint Loresca as the legal representative and conduct a new trial [11, 12].
