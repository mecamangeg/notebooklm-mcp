I. CAPTION
SEVERINO GAGOLA v. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, EMILIANO ALCALA-ALCALA and WENCESLAO DE CASTRO, G.R. No. L-19740, December 17, 1966, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Severino Gagola filed a petition for reinstatement and damages against respondent landowner Emiliana Alcala-Alcala before the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). Gagola claimed he had been a tenant on Alcala's one-hectare land in Sariaya, Quezon since 1945 and was unlawfully ejected in January 1955. Alcala countered that Gagola was merely a hired laborer who was dismissed in 1952 for negligence.

The CAR found that while Gagola was indeed a tenant on a share basis, he was not unlawfully ejected but had voluntarily abandoned the landholding. Consequently, the CAR dismissed the petition. Gagola appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that since Alcala admitted to dismissing him, the burden was on her to prove a lawful cause, and the CAR erred in ruling based on abandonment.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the tenancy relationship was extinguished by the petitioner's voluntary abandonment of the land.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CAR's decision, ruling that the tenancy relationship is extinguished by the "abandonment of the land by the tenant" under Republic Act No. 1199. The Court explained that because a tenant has possession of the land only through personal cultivation, the act of leaving the land constitutes abandonment. Since the relationship was terminated by Gagola's own voluntary act, he has no standing to invoke the protection of the principle of security of tenure. The Court upheld the CAR's factual finding of abandonment as it was supported by substantial evidence.

The judgment dismissing the petition is affirmed.
