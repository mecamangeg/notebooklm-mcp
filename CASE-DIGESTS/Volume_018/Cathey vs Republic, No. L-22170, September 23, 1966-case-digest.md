I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MINOR BERTHA ANN RIVERA. ROBERT H. CATHEY and HELEN O. CATHEY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22170, September 23, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Spouses Robert H. Cathey (an American citizen and permanent resident of the Philippines) and Helen O. Cathey (a Filipino citizen) filed a petition in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Manila to adopt the minor Bertha Ann Rivera [1-3]. The minor is the natural child of Violeta O. Rivera, who provided her written consent to the adoption [2].

During proceedings, the natural mother refused to appear in court to testify, although she was located by a police investigator and reaffirmed her written consent before him [4]. The trial court denied the petition on two grounds: (1) it was not convinced that genuine efforts were exerted to present the natural mother in court, and (2) Robert Cathey, being an alien, was disqualified from adopting [5]. The petitioners appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the personal testimony of the consenting parent is required in adoption proceedings.
2. W/N the petitioner is disqualified from adopting due to his alienage.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Neither substantive nor procedural laws require the testimony of the consenting parent before the court aside from the requisite written consent attached to the petition [4]. Article 340 of the New Civil Code and Section 3, Rule 99 of the Rules of Court only require the *written* consent of the parents to be filed with the petition [4, 6]. Furthermore, the evidence showed petitioners exerted all reasonable efforts to locate the mother, and the welfare of the child should not be prejudiced by the mother's refusal to appear, especially since she had effectively abandoned the child [3, 7].

2. **NO.** Alienage by itself does not disqualify a foreigner from adopting under Philippine laws [8]. Article 335 of the New Civil Code only disqualifies aliens who are: (a) non-residents, or (b) residents whose government has broken diplomatic relations with the Republic of the Philippines [8]. Citing *Uggi Therkelsen v. Republic*, the Court held that outside these two cases, aliens are eligible to adopt [8]. As Robert Cathey is a resident alien with an Immigrant Certificate of Residence, he is qualified to adopt [3].

The judgment appealed from is reversed and the court *a quo* is directed to allow the adoption [9].
