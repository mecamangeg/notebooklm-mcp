**I. CAPTION**
ELIGIO T. LEYVA and IRENEO L. SANTIAGO v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, MUNICIPALITY OF GENERAL SANTOS, COTABATO, et al., G.R. No. L-25469, October 29, 1966, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Republic Act No. 4413 created the City of Rajah Buayan, comprising the jurisdiction of the Municipality of General Santos. Section 92 provided that the Act would take effect on January 1, 1966, if accepted by a "majority of the qualified voters" of the municipality in a plebiscite held on November 9, 1965 [1]. Of the 15,727 registered voters in General Santos, only 7,488 cast votes in the plebiscite: 4,422 voted "Yes" and 3,066 voted "No" [2, 3].

The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) proclaimed the creation of the city, interpreting "majority of qualified voters" to mean the majority of the *votes cast* [2]. Petitioners, residents and property owners, challenged this proclamation, arguing that the approval required a majority of the *total registered voters* [2]. The COMELEC denied their petition, prompting this appeal to the Supreme Court [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the phrase "majority of the qualified voters" in R.A. No. 4413 requires the approval of the majority of the total registered voters rather than just the majority of votes cast.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the phrase "majority of the qualified voters" clearly and unequivocally means "majority of the registered voters" [4, 5].

The Court reasoned that if Congress intended to base the result on the votes cast, it would have expressly used the phrase "majority of the votes cast," as it did in the charter for the City of Laoag (R.A. No. 4584) passed the same year [6]. Furthermore, under the Revised Election Code, the registry list is the conclusive gauge of who possesses the right to vote [7, 8]. A person’s status as a qualified voter does not disappear simply because they fail to vote [8]. To interpret otherwise would lead to absurd results where a minority of the electorate could impose their will on the majority by the mere fact of the latter's absence [3].

Since the 4,422 affirmative votes did not constitute a majority of the 15,727 registered voters, the charter was not validly accepted [5].

The petition is granted, and the COMELEC resolution proclaiming the creation of the City of Rajah Buayan is annulled and set aside [5].
