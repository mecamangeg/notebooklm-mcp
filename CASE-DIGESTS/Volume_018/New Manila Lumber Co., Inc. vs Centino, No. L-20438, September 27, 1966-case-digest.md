I. CAPTION
NEW MANILA LUMBER CO., INC. v. FERMIN CENTINO and THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-20438, September 27, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Fermin Centino filed an unfair labor practice case against petitioner New Manila Lumber Co., Inc. (Case No. 2178-ULP). The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) rendered a decision on March 24, 1961 ordering Centino's reinstatement with back wages. This decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court on May 24, 1961 and became final [1, 2]. On September 21, 1961, petitioner filed an urgent motion to reopen the case, alleging it discovered that Centino had been employed by Manila Mahogany Mfg. Corp. during the pendency of the case, and his earnings there should be deducted [3].

During the hearing on June 7, 1962, petitioner presented evidence of Centino's earnings at Manila Mahogany but moved for a continuance to present evidence of earnings from *other* establishments [4]. The CIR denied the continuance because the urgent motion did not allege earnings from other sources [4]. Subsequently, Centino filed an *ex parte* motion for partial execution. On September 8, 1962, the CIR granted the motion without a hearing, ordering the computation of back wages minus the P226.95 earned at Manila Mahogany [5]. Petitioner moved for reconsideration, claiming the order was issued without notice and hearing, and that it should be allowed to prove other deductible earnings [6]. The CIR denied the motion, prompting this petition for certiorari [7].

III. ISSUES
1. W/N the CIR abused its discretion in granting the writ of execution *ex parte* without notice or hearing.
2. W/N the CIR abused its discretion in denying the motion to adduce evidence on earnings from other firms.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court of Industrial Relations can order the execution of its decision or order which is already final and executory upon a motion *ex parte* by the prevailing party, or even *motu proprio* [8]. It is not necessary that notice of the motion be served on the adverse party, nor is a hearing required [8, 9]. Execution should issue as a matter of right upon a final judgment or order and is mandatory under Section 3, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court [10, 11]. Since the main decision had long become final, the CIR acted within its jurisdiction and did not abuse its discretion [11].

2. **NO.** The power of the CIR under Section 17 of Commonwealth Act No. 103 to modify, alter, or reopen an award can be exercised only upon grounds coming into existence *after* the decision was rendered, not upon grounds already directly or impliedly litigated, or which were available to the parties during the original hearings [10, 12]. The urgent motion only alleged earnings from Manila Mahogany, which were already heard and deducted; earnings from other companies were not alleged in the motion [12]. Furthermore, the issue regarding the right to reinstatement had already been conclusively decided in the previous final judgment [13].

The appeal is found to be without merit [2].
