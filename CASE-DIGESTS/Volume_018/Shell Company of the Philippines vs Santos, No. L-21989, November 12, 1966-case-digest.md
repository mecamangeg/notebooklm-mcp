I. CAPTION
THE SHELL COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FRANCISCO R. SANTOS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21989, November 12, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
This is a direct appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 47564 [1]. The Record on Appeal submitted by the appellants (defendants), including Mutual Security Insurance Corporation, contained "sizeable, substantial and important omissions" regarding the lower court's findings of fact and the dispositive portion of the decision [2, 3]. Specifically, the findings of fact were mixed up with the dispositive portion, and clause "(a)" of the judgment was entirely missing, making it impossible to determine the full ruling [2]. These deficiencies appeared in both the typewritten and printed copies of the record [3]. Consequently, the Supreme Court could not verify the true findings of fact or the legal basis for the appeal [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed due to the omissions in the Record on Appeal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court dismissed the appeal pursuant to **Rule 50, Section 1(e) of the Revised Rules of Court**, which authorizes dismissal for "unauthorized alterations, omissions or additions in the printed record on appeal" [5].

The Court held that while the Clerk of Court has the duty to verify the correctness of copies under Rule 41, Section 10, it is the **primary responsibility of the appellant** to ensure that pleadings, decisions, and orders are correctly transcribed before the record is elevated [4, 6]. This ensures the appellate court can understand the case without resorting to the originals [4]. The Court characterized the omissions as "rank carelessness," rendering the appeal frivolous [3, 5].

**Appeal dismissed.** Appellants were ordered to pay treble costs [5].
