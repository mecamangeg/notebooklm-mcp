I. CAPTION
ESTELITA BERNABE v. ANDRES BOLINAS, JR. and ALFONSO B. BAGUIO, G.R. No. L-22000, November 29, 1966, 18 SCRA 812, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of November 25, 1962, Sedesias del Castillo was walking home when a jeep driven by Pedro del Castillo, Jr. sped towards him. Although Sedesias warned his companions, the jeep intentionally veered toward him, bumping and throwing him to the ground. Pedro del Castillo, Sr. then jumped from the vehicle, struck the fallen Sedesias on the head, and stabbed him twice in the neck, causing his death [1]. The police filed a complaint for Homicide. Petitioner Estelita Bernabe, the victim's widow, requested a reinvestigation, contending the crime was Murder qualified by treachery. However, respondent Fiscals maintained the charge as Homicide, arguing that since the victim saw the jeep coming, the attack was not sudden [2, 3]. Petitioner filed a petition for Mandamus to compel the amendment of the information, but the Court of First Instance dismissed it, ruling that Fiscals have the discretion to determine the nature of the offense [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a writ of Mandamus lies to compel the Provincial Fiscal to amend the information from Homicide to Murder.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's dismissal. While prosecutors have discretion, they are sworn to file information in accordance with the facts and evidence [5]. The Court found that treachery (*alevosia*) was clearly present because the accused adopted a mode of attack—intentionally bumping the victim with a vehicle and stabbing him while he was prostrate—that ensured the crime's commission without risk to themselves [6, 7]. The fact that the victim saw the jeep did not mean he was prepared for the subsequent attack while helpless on the ground [7]. Since the established facts constituted Murder, the Fiscals had a mandatory legal duty to file the corresponding charge. Their refusal to do so constituted a neglect of duty properly remediable by Mandamus [5].

The Order appealed from is reversed, and respondents are directed to amend the information in Criminal Case No. 9624 accordingly [8].
