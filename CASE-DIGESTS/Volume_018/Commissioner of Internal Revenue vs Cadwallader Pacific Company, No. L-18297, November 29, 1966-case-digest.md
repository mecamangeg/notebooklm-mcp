**I. CAPTION**
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. CADWALLADER PACIFIC COMPANY, G.R. No. L-18297, November 29, 1966, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Cadwallader Pacific Company is a domestic corporation with a branch office in California, USA [1]. Its primary purpose is to buy, sell, and deal in general merchandise, though it is also authorized to act as a commercial agent [1]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed respondent for fixed and percentage taxes and surcharges as a commercial broker for the years 1955 to 1957, amounting to P3,651.23 [2].

The assessment was based on transactions where respondent executed contracts in Manila with local buyers [3]. Upon execution, respondent's California branch would procure the goods from manufacturers and ship them directly to the local buyers on its own invoice [4]. The buyers opened irrevocable letters of credit in favor of respondent, not the manufacturers [5]. Respondent assumed the risk of non-payment and owned the price paid by the customers [5]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) set aside the assessment, ruling that respondent was not acting as a commercial broker [2], [1]. The CIR appealed, arguing respondent brought local customers and foreign sellers together [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Cadwallader Pacific Company is a commercial broker or commission merchant liable for the fixed and percentage taxes under Section 194(t) of the Tax Code.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA decision, holding that the respondent is neither a commercial broker nor a commission merchant [6], [7].

Under Section 194(t) of the Tax Code, a commercial broker negotiates for others or brings proposed buyers and sellers together [8]. Citing *Danon v. Brimo & Co.*, the Court held that a broker's duty is to bring the minds of the buyer and seller to an agreement [9], [6]. Here, respondent did not act as a middleman; it bought the merchandise from foreign suppliers and sold it to local customers in its own name [5], [6]. There was no privity of contract between the local buyers and the foreign manufacturers [6].

Furthermore, respondent is not a commission merchant, defined as an agent entrusted with the possession of goods to sell for a principal while title remains with the latter [10]. Respondent purchased merchandise with its own capital, took title in its own name, and sold for its own account [5], [10]. The fact that title passed to the buyer upon shipment in California does not negate that respondent first acquired title from the supplier to transfer it to the buyer [11].

**Petition denied. Judgment affirmed.** [7]
