I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, HERMOGENES CONCEPCION, JR., as City Fiscal of Manila, MANUEL R. PAMARAN, as Investigating Assistant Fiscal and JOSE G. LUKBAN, Director, National Bureau of Investigation v. THE HON. EULOGIO MENCIAS of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, MARTINIANO ABAD and COSME P. GARCIA, G.R. No. L-19633, November 28, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On January 2, 1962, the City Fiscal of Manila received a criminal complaint against respondents Martiniano Abad and Cosme P. Garcia, directors of Continental Oil Company, for violations of the Corporation Law and the Anti-Graft Law regarding the company's purchase of a lot from Xavier School, Inc. [1]. While the preliminary investigation was pending, a minority stockholder filed a civil suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal regarding the same transaction [2]. Abad and Garcia intervened in the civil case and filed a third-party complaint against the petitioners (City Fiscal of Manila et al.), seeking to enjoin the criminal investigation on the ground of a prejudicial civil question [3, 4]. Respondent Judge Mencias of the CFI of Rizal issued a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the petitioners from proceeding with the investigation in Manila [4, 5]. Petitioners moved to dissolve the writ, arguing the CFI of Rizal lacked jurisdiction to enjoin acts in Manila, but the motion was denied [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance of Rizal has jurisdiction to issue a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the City Fiscal of Manila from conducting a preliminary investigation. [6]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the jurisdiction or authority of Courts of First Instance to control or restrain acts by means of a writ of injunction is limited to acts which are being committed or about to be committed within the territorial boundaries of their respective provinces and districts [7, 8]. Since the preliminary investigation was being conducted by the City Fiscal in Manila, it was outside the territorial jurisdiction of the CFI of Rizal [9]. The Court rejected the respondents' argument that the rule should not apply because the writ was sought via a third-party complaint, stating there is no fundamental difference [10].

Furthermore, the Court reiterated the general rule that an injunction will not be granted to restrain a criminal prosecution, citing *Kwong Sing v. City of Manila* [9].

The petition is **GRANTED** and the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the respondent Judge is made permanent [11].
