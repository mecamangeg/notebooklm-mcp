**I. CAPTION**
SPOUSES BASILISA ROQUE and FRANCISCO BAUTISTA v. ARACELI W. VDA. DEL ROSARIO, G.R. No. L-24873, September 23, 1966, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiffs-appellees Spouses Roque filed a petition before the Supreme Court to dismiss the appeal of defendant-appellant Vda. Del Rosario. The ground for the dismissal was that the record on appeal was filed in the trial court 14 days beyond the reglementary period, a fact admitted by the appellant. Previously, the plaintiffs had filed motions for execution of judgment and dismissal of the appeal in the lower court, but these were denied. The trial court reasoned that the notice of appeal and the appeal bond had been filed on time. Appellant opposed the petition in the Supreme Court, relying on the trial court's reasoning and the case of *Santiago v. Valenzuela*.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the appeal should be dismissed for failure to file the record on appeal within the reglementary period, notwithstanding the timely filing of the notice of appeal and appeal bond.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court held that the timely perfection of an appeal is a jurisdictional requisite to enable the appellate court to take cognizance of the case. Citing *Government of the Philippines v. Luis Antonio, et al.*, the Court emphasized that unless the appeal is perfected on time, the appellate court acquires no jurisdiction over the case and has the power only to dismiss it. The Court further noted that the doctrine in *Santiago v. Valenzuela*, cited by the appellant, had already been abandoned in the cases of *Miranda v. Guanzon* and *Valdez v. Acumen*.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
