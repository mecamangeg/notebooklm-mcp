I. CAPTION
SIMEON CHUAH TAK SENG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21599, October 29, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Simeon Chuah Tak Seng filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Manila on July 13, 1959 [1]. He alleged he was single, employed with an average annual income of P2,300, and born in Manila to Chinese parents [1, 2]. The lower court initially granted the petition on October 20, 1960 [3]. However, when petitioner filed to take his oath of citizenship in 1962, the court denied the request [3]. The denial was based on the discovery that petitioner used the names "Simeon Chua" and "Simeon S. Chua" during his elementary and high school studies, respectively, but failed to include these names in his petition and the required publication [4, 5]. Petitioner appealed, arguing the published name was sufficient to identify him [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to include the petitioner's aliases in the publication of the petition is a fatal defect.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The non-inclusion of the petitioner's other names in the publication is fatal. The Court reasoned that such omission deprives persons who knew the petitioner by those names of the opportunity to come forward and inform the authorities of any legal objection to his citizenship [6]. Since the publication was incomplete and insufficient, the trial court did not validly acquire jurisdiction over the case [6]. The Court applied the ruling in *Yu Seco v. Republic* and *Saw Cen v. Republic*, affirming that the failure to disclose all names used constitutes a fatal defect [6, 7].

2. **NO.** The petitioner's income does not qualify as lucrative. The Court noted that the petitioner earned only P2,300 per annum [2]. Citing established jurisprudence, the Court held that even an annual income of P3,000 for a single applicant, free from board and lodging, is not considered a lucrative trade or occupation sufficient to warrant naturalization [2].

The Order appealed from is AFFIRMED and the petition for naturalization is DENIED [8].
