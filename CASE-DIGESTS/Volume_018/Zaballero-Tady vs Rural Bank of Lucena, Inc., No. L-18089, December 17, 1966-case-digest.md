I. CAPTION
INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED VICTORINA ZABALLERO-MILLAR. ESTER ZABALLERO-TADY v. RURAL BANK OF LUCENA, INC., G.R. No. L-18089, December 17, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Victorina Zaballero and Angelina Pansacolo executed a promissory note on October 30, 1957, in favor of the Rural Bank of Lucena for P10,000.00, payable one year after date [1, 2]. The note stipulated that if it was "placed in the hands of an attorney for collection," the makers would pay 10% of the amount due as attorney's fees [3]. Victorina passed away, and on June 12, 1958, the settlement court ordered creditors to file claims against her estate [4]. Pursuant to this order, the Bank filed a claim for the P10,000.00 on September 17, 1958, before the note's maturity date of October 30, 1958 [4, 5]. The administratrix, Ester Zaballero-Tady, acknowledged the principal debt but contested the 10% attorney's fees [4]. The Court of First Instance of Quezon Province ordered the administratrix to pay the principal plus interest and the 10% attorney's fees [6]. The administratrix appealed to the Supreme Court solely on the issue of the attorney's fees [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the estate is liable for the stipulated 10% attorney's fees when the claim was filed before the promissory note's maturity.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the estate is not liable for the attorney's fees. The stipulation "in the event this note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection" contemplates a situation where the note has become due and demandable, and the debtor has refused or neglected to pay [5]. Here, the Bank filed the claim on September 17, 1958, prior to the maturity date of October 30, 1958 [5]. The filing was merely a compliance with the court order under the Rules of Court (formerly Rule 87, now Rule 86) to inform the estate of a contingent obligation [5]. The involvement of the Bank's lawyer was routine and not necessitated by a default [5]. Citing *Shenandoah National Bank v. Marsh*, the Court held that "for collection" implies securing payment *after* maturity [8]. Furthermore, since the debtor died, the debt could only be satisfied through estate settlement proceedings, preventing the estate from being in default [9]. The appealed order is modified by eliminating the award of attorney's fees [10].
