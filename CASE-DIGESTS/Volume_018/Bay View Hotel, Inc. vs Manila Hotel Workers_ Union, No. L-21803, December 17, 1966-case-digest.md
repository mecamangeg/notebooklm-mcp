I. CAPTION
BAY VIEW HOTEL, INC. v. MANILA HOTEL WORKERS' UNION-PTGWO, G.R. No. L-21803, December 17, 1966, 18 SCRA 946, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On September 27, 1962, respondent Manila Hotel Workers' Union filed grievances in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against petitioner Bay View Hotel, Inc., the operator of Manila Hotel. The claims included: (1) non-payment of overtime pay in violation of the Eight-Hour Labor Law (Commonwealth Act No. 444); (2) illegal monthly deductions of P2.00 for medical fees in violation of the Minimum Wage Law (Republic Act No. 602); (3) failure to refund "service charges" collected in lieu of tips; (4) violation of the Collective Bargaining Contract regarding vacation leaves; and (5) Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) involving the dismissal and lockout of 65 employees due to union activities [1-4].

Petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction and that the ULP charge was already the subject of another pending case (Case 3387-ULP) [5]. CIR Judge Tabigne dismissed the petition for want of jurisdiction. However, the CIR *en banc* reversed the dismissal, declaring it had jurisdiction because the employer-employee relationship existed, reinstatement was sought, and the dispute could cause a strike [5]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has jurisdiction over the respondent union's claims.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the jurisdiction of the CIR. Under the doctrine in *Campos v. Manila Railroad Co.*, the CIR has jurisdiction if: (a) an employer-employee relationship exists or reinstatement is sought; and (b) the controversy relates to the Minimum Wage Law, Eight-Hour Labor Law, or involves an unfair labor practice [6].

Here, the employer-employee relationship existed, and the dismissed employees sought reinstatement [7]. The claims regarding overtime pay and medical deductions fall squarely under the Eight-Hour Labor Law and Minimum Wage Law, respectively [8]. The dismissal of union members constitutes an unfair labor practice charge [9]. Regarding the separate ULP case (Case 3387-ULP), the Court held that jurisdiction was not lost because the present complaint was filed prior to the admission of the other case, and the charges were interwoven [9].

Furthermore, regarding the claims for "service charges" and "vacation leaves," the Court applied the principle against split jurisdiction. Since the CIR had jurisdiction over the main causes of action (wages, overtime, ULP), it should exercise jurisdiction over *all* claims arising out of the same employment to avoid multiplicity of suits, as held in *Gomez v. North Camarines Lumber Co.* and *PRISCO v. CIR* [10-13].

Petition for certiorari denied; CIR *en banc* resolution affirmed [14].
