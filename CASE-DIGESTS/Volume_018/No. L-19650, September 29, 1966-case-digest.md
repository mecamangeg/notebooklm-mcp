I. CAPTION
CALTEX (PHILIPPINES), INC. v. ENRICO PALOMAR, in his capacity as THE POSTMASTER GENERAL, G.R. No. L-19650, September 29, 1966, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
In 1960, Caltex (Philippines), Inc. conceived the "Caltex Hooded Pump Contest" to promote its oil products [1]. Participants were asked to estimate the number of liters a hooded gas pump would dispense during a specified period [1]. Participation was open to all motor vehicle owners and licensed drivers, required no fee or consideration, and did not require the purchase of Caltex products [1].

Caltex requested clearance from the postal authorities to use the mails for the contest [2]. Postmaster General Enrico Palomar denied the request, arguing the scheme violated the anti-lottery provisions of the Postal Law (Sections 1954, 1982, and 1983 of the Revised Administrative Code) [3], [4]. Palomar threatened to issue a fraud order if the contest was conducted [4]. Caltex filed a petition for declaratory relief with the Court of First Instance of Manila [5]. The trial court ruled that the contest did not violate the Postal Law, prompting Palomar to appeal to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition states a sufficient cause of action for declaratory relief.
2. W/N the "Caltex Hooded Pump Contest" violates the Postal Law.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that all conditions *sine qua non* for declaratory relief were present: (1) there is a justiciable controversy; (2) the controversy is between persons with adverse interests; (3) the party seeking relief has a legal interest; and (4) the issue is ripe for judicial determination [7]. A live controversy existed because Caltex asserted a legal right to use the mails which Palomar denied, accompanied by a threat of a fraud order [8], [9]. The Court rejected the argument that there was no question of construction, ruling that determining whether the scheme fell within the Postal Law required interpreting the law's intended meaning and application [10].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the contest does not violate the Postal Law.
   
   First, regarding the allegation of a **lottery**, the Court cited *El Debate, Inc. v. Topacio*, establishing that the three essential elements of a lottery are consideration, prize, and chance [11]. While prize and chance were present, the element of **consideration** was absent because participants were not required to pay a fee or buy merchandise [12]. The Court held that the true test of consideration is whether the participant pays valuable consideration for the chance, not whether the sponsor benefits from increased patronage [13].
   
   Second, regarding the allegation of a **gift enterprise**, the Court applied the principle of *noscitur a sociis* (a word is known by its associates) [14]. Since the term "gift enterprise" is used in the Postal Law alongside "lottery," it must be construed to require the same element of consideration to be prohibited [14]. As the contest involved the gratuitous distribution of property by chance without consideration, it is not a condemnable gift enterprise under the law [15].

   The judgment of the lower court was **affirmed** [16].
