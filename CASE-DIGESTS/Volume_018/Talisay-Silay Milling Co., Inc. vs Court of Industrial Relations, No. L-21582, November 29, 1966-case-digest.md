I. CAPTION
TALISAY-SILAY MILLING CO., INC. and J. AMADO ARANETA v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and CENTRAL AZUCARERA DEL DANAO, G.R. No. L-21582, November 29, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Talisay-Silay Milling Co. (Talisay-Silay) and its president, J. Amado Araneta, owned 93% of respondent Central Azucarera del Danao (Danao). In 1960, they transferred their shares to the Philippine National Bank (PNB) under an agreement whereby Talisay-Silay/Araneta assumed liability for obligations incurred prior to the transfer that were not listed in Danao's books [1-3]. Subsequently, the Negros Occidental Federation of Labor filed a complaint for unfair labor practice against Danao in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), seeking reinstatement of employees dismissed in 1953 [4].

Danao filed a third-party complaint against petitioners, alleging the unfair labor practices occurred when petitioners controlled the central and that petitioners were liable under their 1960 agreement [5]. Petitioners moved to dismiss, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction over the third-party complaint due to the absence of an employer-employee relationship between them and Danao. The CIR assumed jurisdiction and denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over a third-party complaint despite the absence of an employer-employee relationship between the third-party plaintiff and third-party defendant.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that while an employer-employee relationship is generally a requisite for CIR jurisdiction, this requirement need not concur for a third-party complaint if the court has already acquired jurisdiction over the main case [6].

The Court explained that a third-party complaint is not an independent action but a continuation of the main action, intended to seek contribution, indemnity, or subrogation under Rule 6, Section 12 of the Revised Rules of Court [6]. Its purpose is to avoid multiple suits and save time and costs. Where a court has jurisdiction over the principal action, it also has jurisdiction over ancillary proceedings, even if it would lack jurisdiction over them as original actions [7]. The Court distinguished a third-party complaint from a counterclaim (which requires independent jurisdiction) and likened it to a cross-claim [8].

The petition is denied and the injunction dissolved [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
J. B. L. Reyes concurred in the result. J. Dizon reserved his vote. J. Barrera took no part [9].
