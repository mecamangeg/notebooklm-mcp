I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. NARCISO DE GRACIA and RAYMUNDO SORIMA, G.R. No. L-21419, September 29, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On May 13, 1961, in Kauswagan, Lanao del Norte, accused Narciso de Gracia, Raymundo Sorima, and Alfredo Salva were drinking together. After Sorima was denied credit for rice at a store, he angrily threatened to "paregla" (kill someone). Later that evening, the three waited by a tree near the road. When the victim, Ernesto Flores, passed by and greeted them, de Gracia and Sorima suddenly held his arms, immobilizing him. Sorima ordered Salva to stab Flores, which Salva did, inflicting a fatal abdominal wound. Flores managed to run to his father's house. Vice-Mayor Agawin, responding to shouts for help, found Flores with his intestines protruding. Flores identified Salva as the stabber and "Naring" (de Gracia) and "Mundo" (Sorima) as the ones who held him. Flores died shortly after. Salva pleaded guilty, while de Gracia and Sorima were tried and convicted of murder by the Court of First Instance, sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua*. They appealed, questioning the credibility of witnesses and the admissibility of Flores' statement.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused are guilty of murder based on the credibility of the eyewitnesses and the victim's declaration.
2. W/N the crime was qualified by treachery (*alevosia*).
3. W/N the mitigating circumstance of intoxication should be appreciated.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court found the eyewitness testimonies credible, noting that inconsistencies in minor details reinforce rather than weaken credibility as they indicate a lack of rehearsal [1]. Furthermore, the victim's statement to Vice-Mayor Agawin identifying the appellants was admissible as an *ante mortem* statement (dying declaration) because the nature of the wound allowed the inference that the victim was conscious of impending death [2]. It was also admissible as part of the *res gestae*, having been made spontaneously and immediately after the startling occurrence [2].

2. **YES.** The crime committed was murder qualified by *alevosia*. The immobilization of the victim by the appellants while their co-accused stabbed him, coupled with the suddenness of the attack on an unprepared victim who had just greeted them friendly, ensured the execution of the crime without risk to the attackers [3]. The Court ruled that treachery absorbs the aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior strength and nocturnity [4].

3. **YES.** The record established that the appellants were under the influence of liquor at the time of the offense, and there was no proof of habituality. Consequently, drunkenness is appreciated as a mitigating circumstance [4].

**Disposition:** The judgment is **MODIFIED**. The conviction for murder is upheld, but due to the presence of the mitigating circumstance of intoxication and the application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the penalty is reduced to an indeterminate sentence of twelve (12) years of *prision mayor* as minimum to eighteen (18) years of *reclusion temporal* as maximum.
