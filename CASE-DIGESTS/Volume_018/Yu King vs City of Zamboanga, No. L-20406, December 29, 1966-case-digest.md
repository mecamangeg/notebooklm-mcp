I. CAPTION
ENRIQUE R. YU KING v. CITY OF ZAMBOANGA, G.R. No. L-20406, December 29, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Enrique R. Yu King filed a complaint against the City of Zamboanga to annul City Ordinances Nos. 340, 503, and 672, and sought a refund of P26,779.92 paid as specific taxes on gasoline, kerosene, and oil sold from 1950 to 1955 [1]. The Court of First Instance of Zamboanga declared the ordinances void and ordered the refund [1]. The City appealed, asserting its authority to enact the ordinances under its charter, Commonwealth Act No. 39, and Republic Act No. 1435 [2]. Yu King argued the ordinances were invalid because they lacked the required certification by the City Mayor for emergency measures, and specifically challenged Ordinance No. 340 for being retroactive [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City of Zamboanga has the authority to enact ordinances imposing specific taxes on gasoline and oil.
2. W/N the ordinances are void due to alleged defects in their enactment as emergency measures or due to retroactivity.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The City of Zamboanga has the specific power to tax. Under Section 14(a) of Commonwealth Act No. 39, as amended, the City is authorized "to tax, fix the license fee for... the storage and sale of... oil, gasoline, benzine... or any of the products thereof" [5].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the ordinances are valid. Regarding the alleged lack of certification, the presumption is that official duty in connection with the enactment of ordinances has been duly complied with [6]. It was incumbent upon Yu King to prove the lack of certification, which he failed to do [3, 4]. As for Ordinance No. 340, the fact that it was passed on October 6, 1950, and made retroactive to October 3, 1950—a period of only five days—is an insignificant circumstance that does not render the measure void [4, 7].

The decision appealed from is REVERSED, and the complaint is DISMISSED [8].
