**I. CAPTION**
CITIZENS' LEAGUE OF FREEWORKERS AND/OR BALBINO EPIS, NICOLAS ROJO, ET AL., petitioners, vs. HON. MACAPANTON ABBAS, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Davao and TEOFILO GERONIMO and EMERITA MENDEZ, respondents, G.R. No. L-21212, September 23, 1966, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondents-spouses Geronimo and Mendez were owners and operators of auto-calesas in Davao City. The individual petitioners were drivers who operated these vehicles under a "boundary system." Asserting their status as employees, the drivers formed the petitioner Union and demanded collective bargaining. When the spouses refused to bargain, claiming the drivers were merely lessees, the Union declared a strike on February 20, 1963 [1].

On March 11, 1963, the spouses filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 3966) with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao, presided by respondent Judge Abbas, seeking to restrain the Union from interfering with their business. Judge Abbas issued a writ of preliminary injunction on the same day [1, 2]. The Union subsequently filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice against the spouses with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) on March 12, 1963. The Union then moved to dissolve the CFI injunction, arguing it was void under Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act). Judge Abbas denied the motion, ruling that no employer-employee relationship existed under the boundary system; hence, the Rules of Court, not the labor law, applied [2]. The Union filed this petition for certiorari.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction to issue and maintain the preliminary injunction against the drivers operating under the boundary system.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Court of First Instance erred in assuming jurisdiction and maintaining the injunction.

The Court reiterated the doctrine in *National Labor Union v. Dinglasan* and *Isabelo Doce v. Workmen's Compensation Commission*, ruling that a driver operating under the "boundary system" is considered an **employee** of the owner/operator within the meaning of the law [3]. The features of the boundary system (lack of fixed wage, fuel paid by driver) are insufficient to withdraw the relationship from that of employer-employee [4].

Since an employer-employee relationship existed, the controversy was a valid labor dispute. Consequently, upon the filing of the complaint for unfair labor practice on March 12, 1963, the Court of Industrial Relations acquired complete and exclusive jurisdiction over the matter [5, 6]. The CFI should have dismissed Civil Case No. 3966 or suspended proceedings until the CIR resolved the labor dispute.

**Petition granted.** The writ of preliminary injunction issued by the respondent judge is set aside [6].
