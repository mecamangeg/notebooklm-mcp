I. CAPTION
CITIZENS LABOR UNION-CCLU v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, MALAYANG MANGGAGAWA SA ESSO, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR and ESSO STANDARD EASTERN, INC., G.R. No. L-24320 (consolidated with L-24431), November 12, 1966, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent union Malayang Manggagawa sa Esso (MME) filed a petition for certification election to determine the bargaining agent for the rank-and-file employees of Esso Standard Eastern, Inc. (ESSO) at its Pandacan Terminal. MME sought to administer the remaining term of the existing Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between petitioner Citizens Labor Union (CLU) and ESSO. CLU and ESSO moved to dismiss the petition citing the "Contract-Bar Policy," but the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) denied the motion and ordered the election. MME won the election and was certified by the CIR as the exclusive bargaining agent. CLU filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Supreme Court. During the pendency of the case, the subject CBA expired on July 8, 1966. Consequently, CLU and ESSO alleged that the employee composition had substantially changed due to retirements and layoffs, rendering the previous election results inaccurate.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition should be dismissed for CLU's failure to file a notice of appeal with the CIR.
2. W/N the Court should uphold MME as the bargaining agent based on the March 1965 election results despite the expiration of the CBA and alleged changes in employee composition.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court rejected the jurisdictional objection. Although CLU initially filed a special civil action for certiorari and mandamus, the Court treated it as a petition for review in the interest of justice, given the CIR's inaction on motions for reconsideration which effectively amounted to a denial. This aligns with the ruling in *Cruz vs. Court of Industrial Relations*.

2. **NO.** The expiration of the CBA rendered the "Contract-Bar" arguments academic. However, the Court could not definitively declare a bargaining agent because of the conflicting assertions regarding the change in the workforce. While there is a presumption of continued majority status, this does not apply "in face of an assertion and offer of proof to the contrary" or in view of "altered circumstances" (*Steward Die Casting Corp. vs. NLRB*; *Reliance Mfg. Co. vs. NLRB*). The burden of proving majority status rests on the union asserting it. Since the record was barren of evidence regarding the *current* factual situation, the Court could not resolve the representation issue.

**CASE REMANDED** to the Court of Industrial Relations to investigate and certify the appropriate bargaining unit pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Industrial Peace Act.
