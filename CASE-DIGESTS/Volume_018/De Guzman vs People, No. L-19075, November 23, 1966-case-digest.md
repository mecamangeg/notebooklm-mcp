I. CAPTION
ESTEFANIA DE GUZMAN v. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-19075, November 23, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On October 31, 1958, petitioner Estefania De Guzman, a section chief at the Philippine National Bank (PNB), called complainant Lourdes Tagle, a job analyst in the same bank, to her office to discuss a debt. After Tagle left, De Guzman noticed that her cash amounting to P90.00 was missing. She summoned Tagle back and confronted her, stating that Tagle was the only one who had approached her table and that the money disappeared immediately after Tagle left. When Tagle denied taking the money, De Guzman replied, "who knows?" and questioned why Tagle was no longer carrying her wallet. De Guzman then suggested that Tagle submit to a body search. These statements were made in a loud voice in the presence of other employees. Tagle was subsequently charged and convicted by the Court of First Instance of Manila for Slander under Article 358 of the Revised Penal Code, which the Court of Appeals affirmed. De Guzman appealed, arguing she did not directly call Tagle a "thief" and that she acted without malice.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is guilty of slander despite not directly calling the complainant a thief.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that slander was committed because, while the petitioner did not directly call the offended party a thief, the implication of her acts and statements was clearly to that effect [1, 2]. The Court found that malice in fact existed, evidenced by the petitioner's remarks made in a loud voice in the presence of many persons, particularly the suggestion that the complainant submit to a search of her person [1, 3]. The Court noted that a legitimate inquiry should have been done discreetly and not in the form of imputations within the hearing of other employees [3].

The petition is **DENIED**. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the indemnity awarded to the complainant is reduced from P1,000.00 to P500.00 [3].
