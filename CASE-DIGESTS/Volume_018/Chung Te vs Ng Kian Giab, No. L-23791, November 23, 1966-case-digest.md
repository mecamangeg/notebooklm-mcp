**I. CAPTION**
CHUNG TE v. NG KIAN GIAB and THE HONORABLE DIRECTOR OF PATENTS, G.R. No. L-23791, November 23, 1966, Makalintal, J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Chung Te filed an application for registration of the trademark "Marca Piña" on November 25, 1958, claiming use since January 8, 1951. Respondent Ng Kian Giab had filed an application for the same trademark earlier on July 16, 1957, claiming use since December 6, 1955. An interference proceeding was declared by the Director of Patents to determine priority of adoption and use [2, 3].

During the hearings, both parties presented evidence of earlier use. However, the Director of Patents disregarded the evidence of both parties, finding neither had satisfactorily proven their asserted dates of first use. Relying on Rule 173 of the Rules of Practice in the Philippines Patent Office, the Director restricted the parties to their respective filing dates. Consequently, Ng Kian Giab (filing date July 16, 1957) was declared the senior party over Chung Te (filing date November 25, 1958) and was granted registration. Chung Te appealed, arguing the Director erred in disregarding his evidence of prior use, including a prior abandoned application filed on March 31, 1957 [4-6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N petitioner Chung Te established prior use of the trademark "Marca Piña" superior to that of respondent.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Director of Patents.

While findings of fact by the Director of Patents are generally conclusive on the Supreme Court, this rule applies only when supported by substantial evidence (*Anchor Trading Co. v. Director of Patents*) [6, 7]. In this case, the Director overlooked substantial evidence establishing the petitioner's prior use.

First, even if testimonial evidence were disregarded and reliance placed solely on filing dates, the Court held that an abandoned application filed by a junior party becomes "cogent evidence" that he used the trademark as of the date of that filing (*Smith v. Hall*) [7, 8]. Chung Te had filed a prior application for the same mark on March 31, 1957 (Application No. 5544), which predates Ng Kian Giab’s application of July 16, 1957 [6, 8].

Second, the petitioner presented substantial documentary evidence—including business licenses, receipts for the purchase of "Marca Piña" labels, and sales receipts—proving use of the trademark as early as 1952 [9-11]. Conversely, the respondent failed to substantiate his claim of use prior to 1955. When an applicant seeks to prove a date of first use earlier than what was stated under oath in the application, they must present "clear and convincing evidence" (*B.R. Baker Co. v. Lebow Bros.*), which the respondent failed to do [12-14].

**Decision reversed.** Petitioner is adjudged the prior user and registration in his name is ordered [15].
