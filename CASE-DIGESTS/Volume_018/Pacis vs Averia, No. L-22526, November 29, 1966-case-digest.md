I. CAPTION
PEDRO PACIS, in his capacity as Acting Collector of Customs, Port of Manila, et al. v. HON. ALBERTO V. AVERIA, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Cavite, et al., G.R. No. L-22526, November 29, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On December 26, 1963, the Philippine Navy intercepted the M/B "Bukang Liwayway" carrying untaxed foreign cigarettes [1]. The vessel and goods were turned over to the Bureau of Customs. On January 13, 1964, petitioner Pedro Pacis, Acting Collector of Customs, instituted seizure and forfeiture proceedings [2]. On the same day, respondent Eusebio Marges, the alleged owner, filed a civil case for replevin in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cavite, presided by respondent Judge Averia, claiming the boat had been stolen [2].

Judge Averia issued a writ of replevin on January 14, 1964 [3]. The petitioners moved to dismiss the case and lift the writ, arguing that the CFI lacked jurisdiction as the vessel was already subject to seizure proceedings [4]. The CFI denied the motion [4]. Consequently, the Provincial Sheriff, respondent Silangcruz, took the vessel and delivered it to Marges [5]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court. Despite a mandatory injunction issued by the Supreme Court ordering the Sheriff to retake possession of the vessel, the Sheriff failed to comply, claiming the boat was lost in a typhoon—a claim contradicted by weather reports [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to issue a writ of replevin for property subject to seizure and forfeiture proceedings by the Collector of Customs.
2. W/N the respondent Sheriff is liable for contempt of court.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court of First Instance should yield to the jurisdiction of the Collector of Customs [8]. While the Judiciary Act of 1948 grants the CFI original jurisdiction over cases involving property valued above a certain amount, the Tariff and Customs Code (R.A. 1937) is a later law that must prevail [8]. The Court reasoned that the legislative intent was to divest the CFI of the prerogative to replevin property subject to seizure and forfeiture, as allowing such actions would undermine the enforcement of customs laws [8]. Furthermore, Section 2303 of the Tariff and Customs Code provides the owner due process within the administrative proceedings; the proper judicial recourse is an appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals after exhausting administrative remedies, not an action in the CFI [9].

2. **YES.** The Sheriff is guilty of contempt for failing to enforce the Supreme Court's writ of preliminary mandatory injunction and failing to make a return for an extended period [10]. His negligence and false justifications regarding the vessel's loss directly interfered with and obstructed the Court's processes, causing a setback to the administration of justice [10].

Petition granted. The writ of replevin and the CFI order are declared null and void. Respondent Sheriff is sentenced to imprisonment and a fine [11, 12].
