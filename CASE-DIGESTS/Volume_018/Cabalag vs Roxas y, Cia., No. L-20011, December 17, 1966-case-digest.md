I. CAPTION
HEIRS OF PEDRO CABALAG, ETC., ET AL. v. ROXAS Y CIA., ET AL., G.R. No. L-20011, December 17, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On December 2, 1958, the Heirs of Pedro Cabalag (Petitioners) filed an action in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) against Roxas y Cia. (Respondents) to be recognized as farm tenants of Lot 105-A of Hacienda Palico [1]. On May 3, 1962, the CAR rendered a decision dismissing the petitioners' claim [2]. Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied on June 4, 1962 [2]. Subsequently, petitioners filed with the Supreme Court a petition for leave to appeal as pauper and for an extension of time, which the Court granted [2]. On July 10, 1962, petitioners filed their petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [3]. However, they failed to file a notice of appeal with the respondent CAR [3, 4]. Respondents Roxas y Cia. moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that the appeal was not perfected [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners perfected their appeal despite their failure to file a notice of appeal with the Court of Agrarian Relations.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the failure of the petitioners to file a notice of appeal with the Court of Agrarian Relations within the reglementary period resulted in the non-perfection of their appeal [4, 5]. Under the applicable rules (Rule 44 of the Rules of Court, applied to CAR cases), an appeal by certiorari must be perfected by filing a notice of appeal with the lower court (CAR) *and* a petition with the Supreme Court [6, 7]. The requirement to file a notice of appeal with the Agrarian Court is mandatory and jurisdictional [4, 8].

Consequently, the decision sought to be reviewed became final and executory, precluding the Supreme Court from acquiring jurisdiction over the case [4, 5]. The Court emphasized that a client is bound by the mistakes of their counsel in the conduct of the case [4]. Citing *Montejo v. Cabangon* and *Heirs of Patricio Pabores v. Workmen's Compensation Commission*, the Court ruled that the omission is fatal to the action [8, 9].

Petition dismissed [10].
