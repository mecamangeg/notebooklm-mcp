**I. CAPTION**
ASUNCION ABORDO, ET AL. v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS and ROMAN ABORDO, G.R. No. L-22288, November 29, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners Asuncion, Jose, and Mercedes (heirs of the late Isidoro Abordo) filed an action for reconveyance of Lot No. 2438 against respondent Roman Abordo (Isidoro's brother). Petitioners alleged that Isidoro had entrusted Roman to file an answer for the lot in Isidoro’s name, but Roman breached this trust by registering the title (OCT No. 18962) in his own name in 1936 [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance of Leyte ruled in favor of Roman, declaring him the owner [1]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the decision, finding the evidence insufficient to establish the creation of an express trust due to the lack of a written instrument and contradictions in testimony. The CA also upheld the finding that Roman had been in exclusive and adverse possession of the land since 1939 [3, 4]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, framing their legal questions on the assumption that an express trust existed, citing a portion of the CA decision discussing the "possibility" of such a trust [5, 6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Supreme Court may review the Court of Appeals' factual finding regarding the non-existence of an express trust.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the finding of fact by the Court of Appeals as to the non-establishment of an express trust is final and not reviewable by the Supreme Court [7].

The Court cited *Cabrera vs. Lopez* and *Pacheco vs. Arro* in ruling that such factual findings are conclusive [7]. Consequently, the legal questions raised by petitioners regarding the repudiation of trust and prescription could not be resolved because they lacked a factual basis; without a trust, there is no trustee, and there is no legal obstacle to applying the rules of adverse possession in favor of the respondent [5, 7]. The Court further clarified that the CA's statement regarding the "possibility" that a trust existed was not a finding of fact but merely an observation stressing the petitioners' laches for sleeping on their rights for over twenty years [6, 8].

The appeal is dismissed [8].
