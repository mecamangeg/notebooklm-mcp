I. CAPTION
**TESTACY OF MAXIMA SANTOS VDA. DE BLAS. ROSALINA SANTOS (Executrix), petitioner and appellee, vs. FLORA BLAS DE BUENAVENTURA (Legatee), oppositor and appellant.**, G.R. No. L-22797, September 22, 1966 (Resolution Amending Decision dated November 29, 1966), Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Maxima Santos Vda. de Blas died on October 5, 1956. Rosalina Santos, her niece and executrix, filed a petition for the probate of Maxima's will allegedly executed on September 22, 1956. Flora Blas de Buenaventura, a devisee named in the will but not related by blood, filed an opposition alleging fraud, undue influence, and mental incapacity of the testatrix [1-3].

However, before the oppositors could close their evidence, Flora filed a manifestation on November 6, 1957, withdrawing her opposition and joining the petition for probate. She claimed she did so to protect her rights and upon the advice of the petitioner’s lawyer after selling her house to fund the litigation [4-6]. The trial court allowed the probate. Subsequently, Flora moved for the delivery of her specific devise (a fishpond). Rosalina opposed, invoking the "no-contest and forfeiture" clause (Item 14) of the will, which stated that any heir or legatee who contests or opposes the probate or the carrying out of provisions shall lose their right to the inheritance [6, 7]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal denied Flora’s motion, ruling she had violated the forfeiture clause [8]. Flora appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Flora violated the "no-contest and forfeiture" clause of the will despite withdrawing her opposition.
2. W/N Flora is entitled to the fruits and income of the specific devise from the time of the testatrix's death.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court, holding that Flora did not violate the clause. The Court found that Flora's initial opposition was grounded on "strong doubts" and was not malicious, given the testatrix's advanced age (86), severe medical condition (requiring blood transfusions), and the sudden change from a previous will [9-12]. Crucially, Flora withdrew her opposition *before* resting her case, which contributed to the speedy probate of the will [13]. The Court noted that the clause prohibited contesting the probate *and* the carrying out of provisions; by withdrawing, Flora conformed to the testatrix's wish that the dispositions be carried out. Her actuations, taken as a whole, served rather than violated the testatrix's intention [13, 14].

2. **YES.** Under Articles 948 and 951 of the New Civil Code, a devise of a specific and determinate thing includes its growing fruits and uncollected income accruing from the moment of the testator's death [15]. Furthermore, under Article 1166, the obligation to give a determinate thing includes delivering all accessions [16]. The Court ordered the delivery of the fishpond with all fruits or rents acquired from the testatrix's death until delivery [17]. However, the Court ruled Flora was not entitled to interest on these fruits because the administratrix incurs no delay (and thus no liability for interest under Arts. 1169 and 2209) until the court orders the delivery of the legacy, which had not yet occurred [18].

**Orders reversed.** Case remanded for the delivery of the devise, fruits, and accounting; P5,000 attorney's fees awarded to appellant [17].
