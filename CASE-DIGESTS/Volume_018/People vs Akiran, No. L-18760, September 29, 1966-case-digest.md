**I. CAPTION**
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. KAMAD AKIRAN, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-18760, September 29, 1966, 18 SCRA 239, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
On July 26, 1960, Isirani Sakili, his brother Hadji Hassan, and their driver were stopped by a group of armed men, including accused Jarang Askali, Kamad Akiran, Alammara Dumpas, and Kastiri Sappari, at the Indanan-Lapa road in Sulu [1]. Jarang Askali ordered Isirani to alight and demanded P1,600 from Hadji Hassan for Isirani's release, threatening to kill Isirani otherwise [1]. Isirani was detained in an abaca plantation and later at a house for several hours while Hadji Hassan raised the money [1]. Isirani was released only after Hadji Hassan and his father-in-law paid P1,000 to Jarang Askali, with a promise to pay the balance later [1, 2]. The defense claimed that the money was intended as payment for the hospitalization expenses of Jarang's brother, who had been shot by Isirani's relative, and thus was not "ransom" [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance of Sulu convicted the accused of kidnapping for ransom and sentenced them to death [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the money demanded, allegedly for hospitalization expenses, constitutes "ransom" under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that even if the purpose was to compel payment for hospitalization expenses, the crime is still kidnapping for ransom under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 1084 [6-8]. Interpreting the provision derived from the U.S. Lindbergh Law, "ransom" is defined in its ordinary sense as "money, price or consideration paid or demanded for redemption of a captured person or persons, a payment that releases from captivity" [9]. Since the accused demanded and received money as a requisite for releasing Isirani from captivity, the money is ransom regardless of the motive [9].

The judgment of conviction is **AFFIRMED**, with the modification that the penalty is reduced to *reclusion perpetua* due to the lack of necessary votes to impose the death penalty [10].
