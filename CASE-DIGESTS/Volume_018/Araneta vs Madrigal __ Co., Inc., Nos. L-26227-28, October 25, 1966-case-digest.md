I. CAPTION
J. ANTONIO ARANETA v. MADRIGAL & CO., INC., and THE HONORABLE JOSE S. RODRIGUEZ, et al., G.R. Nos. L-26227-28, October 25, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Araneta filed civil cases against respondent Madrigal & Co., Inc. for damages resulting from fires that spread from Madrigal’s orchard to Araneta’s property. The Court of First Instance rendered a decision ordering Madrigal to pay P24,996.00 plus interest [1]. Madrigal appealed to the Court of Appeals. Araneta moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing that Madrigal's record on appeal failed to include data showing that the appeal was perfected on time, in violation of Rule 41, Section 6 of the Rules of Court [1]. The Court of Appeals denied the motion, claiming discretion to give due course to appeals if actually perfected on time [1, 2]. Araneta filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals acquired jurisdiction over the appeal despite the record on appeal failing to show data that the appeal was perfected on time.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The requirement under Rule 41, Section 6 of the Revised Rules of Court that the record on appeal shall include "such data as will show that the appeal was perfected on time" is **mandatory and jurisdictional** [3]. Unless the appeal is perfected on time, the appellate court acquires no jurisdiction over the case and has power only to dismiss the appeal [3]. The Court emphasized its ruling in *Government of the Philippines v. Antonio*, stating that the burden is on the appellant to show timeliness in the record itself because original records are not forwarded in ordinary appeals [3, 4]. The certification of the record by the trial court after the expiration of the period cannot restore lost jurisdiction [3]. The amendment to the Rules was specifically designed to eliminate the waste of time involved in verifying conflicting allegations regarding the timeliness of appeals [5, 6].

The resolutions of the Court of Appeals were set aside, and it was directed to dismiss the appeal [7].
