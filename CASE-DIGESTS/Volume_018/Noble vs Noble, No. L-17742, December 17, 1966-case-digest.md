I. CAPTION
**TESTATE ESTATE OF THE LATE DON VICENTE NOBLE. JUAN NOBLE v. MARIA S. NOBLE**, G.R. No. L-17742, December 17, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Don Vicente Noble died on April 25, 1959. Juan Noble, the executor named in the will, instituted proceedings for the probate of the decedent's last will. Maria S. Noble opposed the probate, claiming to be an illegitimate (spurious) child of the deceased born out of an illicit relationship. She alleged that the will was void and prayed to be declared an heir entitled to one-half of the hereditary estate [1], [2]. Maria filed a motion to present evidence of her filiation, alleging she was in "continuous possession of status of a child" and had evidence that the deceased was her father [3]. Juan Noble opposed this motion, arguing that her claim was effectively an action for compulsory recognition, which is barred after the putative father's death under Article 285 of the New Civil Code [4]. The Court of First Instance admitted the will to probate and dismissed Maria's petition to prove filiation on the ground of prescription [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an illegitimate (spurious) child may bring an action to establish filiation and claim inheritance rights after the death of the putative father, based solely on allegations of "continuous possession of status" and material paternity without alleging voluntary acknowledgment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. Under Article 887 of the Civil Code, while illegitimate children must prove their filiation, this filiation must be *acknowledged* by the presumed parent [6], [7]. Proof of mere "naked paternity" is insufficient, as it would expose the decedent to scandalous inquiries and fictitious claims when they can no longer defend themselves [6].

Article 289 allows investigation of paternity for illegitimate (not natural) children only under the circumstances for compulsory recognition in Articles 283 and 284 [7]. Consequently, the time limits for actions for recognition under Article 285 apply: the action must generally be brought during the lifetime of the presumed parent [4], [8]. Maria Noble merely alleged "continuous possession of status of a child," which is a ground for *compelling* recognition, but she did not allege that her father had voluntarily acknowledged her [3]. Citing *Paulino v. Paulino*, the Court held that acknowledgment is the essential basis for the right to inherit; without an allegation of voluntary acknowledgment, the action is one to compel recognition, which cannot be brought after the putative father's death [9], [10].

The order appealed from is hereby **AFFIRMED**.
