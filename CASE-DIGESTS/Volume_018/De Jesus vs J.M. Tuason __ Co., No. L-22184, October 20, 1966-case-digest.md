I. CAPTION
**JOSE C. DE JESUS, PEDRO ALCANTARA, ET AL. v. J. M. TUASON & CO., ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-22184, October 20, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
J.M. Tuason & Co. (Tuasons) held a Torrens title over a large tract of land in Quezon City [1]. They entered into a Compromise Agreement in 1953 with the Deudors, who claimed the same land under an *informacion possessoria*, wherein the Deudors renounced their rights in exchange for payment [1, 2]. Subsequently, the Tuasons filed ejectment suits against the petitioners, occupants of the land who claimed they had purchased their lots from the Deudors and were entitled to rights under the Compromise Agreement [3, 4].

Instead of answering the ejectment suits, petitioners filed a separate amended complaint in the Court of First Instance of Rizal on December 5, 1962, seeking to enforce their alleged preferential right to buy the lots under the Compromise Agreement and to enjoin the Tuasons from ejecting them [4]. The trial court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the Compromise Agreement had already been rescinded by the Supreme Court in a prior case (*Deudor v. Tuason*) [5]. Petitioners appealed directly to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners can maintain a separate action to enforce their rights under the Compromise Agreement while ejectment suits against them are pending.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the petitioners' action is barred because it is in the nature of a **compulsory counterclaim** [6, 7]. The asserted right of the petitioners to buy the land is necessarily connected with the subject matter of the possessory actions (ejectment suits) already filed by the Tuasons against them [7, 8].

Under Section 4, Rule 9 (formerly Section 6, Rule 10) of the Revised Rules of Court, a counterclaim that arises out of or is necessarily connected with the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim must be set up in the same action [7, 8]. As compulsory counterclaims, they cannot be set up in subsequent or separate actions such as the present case [9, 10]. To avoid multiplicity of suits, these claims must be asserted in the possessory actions if those judgments are not yet final [10].

Decision affirmed [11].
