**I. CAPTION**
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ALOD MANOBO and MALOMPON MANOBO**, G.R. No. L-13798, September 20, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
On August 8, 1954, in Kilain, Davao, Uy Kee Kang (*alias* Chiquito), his wife Mandoloon Manoba, and Te Chu (*alias* Tiago) were killed in their home. The bodies bore multiple stab and gunshot wounds. Appellants Alod and Malompon Manobo executed extrajudicial confessions on August 16, 1954, admitting they conspired with two others to rob and kill the victims. They detailed their weapons and method of entry. However, at trial, they retracted these confessions, claiming they were obtained through maltreatment and torture by the PC officers and the victim’s father. They also presented an alibi.

The Court of First Instance of Davao convicted them of triple homicide, finding insufficient evidence for robbery. The Court of Appeals, believing the penalty should be *reclusion perpetua* for each murder, certified the case to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the extrajudicial confessions are admissible despite claims of maltreatment.
2. W/N the appellants can be convicted of robbery with homicide.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the claim of maltreatment was untenable. The appellants failed to complain to the Justice of the Peace when they swore to their confessions, and a physician who examined them at the instance of their counsel certified that they showed no external signs of injury [1, 2]. Furthermore, a confessant carries the burden of convincing the judge that admissions are involuntary or untrue [3]. A voluntary extrajudicial confession, when supported by evidence of *corpus delicti*, sustains a finding of guilt [4, 5]. Here, the *corpus delicti* of the slayings was unquestionable and corroborated by the recovery of murder weapons in Alod's house [4, 6].

2. **NO.** The appellants cannot be convicted of robbery with homicide because there was no adequate independent proof of the robbery. Although the appellants admitted an intent to rob in their confessions, this does not constitute actual robbery [7, 8]. Under Rule 133, Section 3 of the Revised Rules of Court, extrajudicial confessions will not support a conviction for robbery without separate proof of the *corpus delicti* of the robbery itself [9, 10]. Since no robbery was proven, the crime is Triple Murder, qualified by treachery and aggravated by dwelling [11, 12].

**Judgment modified.** The appellants are convicted of Triple Murder and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* [13].
