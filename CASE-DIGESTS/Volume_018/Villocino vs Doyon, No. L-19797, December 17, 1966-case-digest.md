I. CAPTION
MARCIANA VILLOCINO and PROTASIO RODRIGUEZ v. PEDRO DOYON and CLETO P. EVANGELISTA, G.R. No. L-19797, December 17, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Marciana Villocino and her husband Bartolome Rodriguez acquired two parcels of land (one in Kananga, Leyte, and another in Ormoc City) prior to the effectivity of the New Civil Code on August 30, 1950 [1, 2]. Bartolome, who was living with a concubine, sold these conjugal lots to defendant Pedro Doyon without the knowledge and consent of his wife [3-5]. Doyon subsequently sold one of the lots to intervenor Cleto P. Evangelista [4].

In a prior case (Civil Case No. 549), the trial court had found that Bartolome fraudulently disposed of conjugal properties and consequently transferred the administration of the conjugal partnership to Villocino [4, 5]. Villocino and Protasio Rodriguez then filed the present suit to recover possession and ownership of the lots [1, 6]. The Court of First Instance of Leyte ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring the sale void under Article 166 of the New Civil Code due to the lack of the wife's consent [1, 6]. Appellants Doyon and Evangelista appealed, arguing that since the properties were acquired before the New Civil Code, the Spanish Civil Code should apply, which allowed the husband to alienate conjugal property without the wife's consent [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the sale of conjugal properties acquired before the New Civil Code by the husband without the wife's consent was valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the sale was invalid insofar as it affected the rights of the wife [3, 9].

The Court agreed with the appellants that the New Civil Code (Article 166) does not apply to properties acquired before August 30, 1950, and that under the Spanish Civil Code, the husband generally had the power to alienate conjugal property without the wife's consent [2]. However, citing *Simbre v. Agustin* and *Liguez v. Court of Appeals*, the Court ruled that this power is not absolute and cannot be exercised to the prejudice of the wife or her heirs [2]. Alienations made without the knowledge of the wife are presumed to be in fraud of her [2].

Since the husband sold the lots without the wife's knowledge while maintaining a concubine, the transaction was fraudulent and prejudiced the wife's interest [5]. Under *Baello v. Villanueva*, such alienation is invalid to the extent that it includes the wife's half of the conjugal property [2]. Consequently, the sale is subject to the outcome of the liquidation of the conjugal partnership, and this condition should be annotated on the title [3].

Judgment modified [10].
