I. CAPTION
MARINO J. BAUTISTA v. THE HON. JUAN DE BORJA and G. A. MACHINERIES, INC., G.R. No. L-20600, October 28, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On December 28, 1961, respondent G. A. Machineries, Inc. filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Bulacan (Civil Case No. 2486) against petitioner Marino J. Bautista for replevin and damages arising from Bautista's failure to pay installments on personal properties purchased and secured by a chattel mortgage [1, 2]. Bautista filed a supplemental motion to dismiss on the ground of improper venue, citing an express stipulation in their sales and chattel mortgage contracts which stated that "in case of any litigation arising (t)herefrom or in connection (t)herewith, the venue of action shall be in the City of Manila, Philippines" [3].

Respondent Judge De Borja denied the motion to dismiss and subsequent motion for reconsideration, and allowed G. A. Machineries, Inc. to present evidence *ex parte* [4, 5]. Bautista filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court, arguing the Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion as the venue stipulation was valid and exclusive [6, 7]. Respondent corporation argued the stipulation was merely for its benefit and did not waive its right to choose the venue fixed by law [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the venue was improperly laid in the Court of First Instance of Bulacan given the stipulation in the contracts.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the venue was improperly laid in Bulacan. The Court found that the parties expressly stipulated in their written contracts that the venue of action "shall be in the City of Manila" [9]. Neither party reserved the right to choose the venue fixed by law (e.g., residence of the parties), which is usually done if they intend to retain that right [9]. It is reasonably inferred that the parties intended to definitely fix the venue in the City of Manila only, to the exclusion of other courts [10].

Such stipulation is expressly sanctioned by Section 3, Rule 4 of the Revised Rules of Court, which allows venue to be changed or transferred by written agreement [10]. Citing *Central Azucarera de Tarlac v. De Leon* (56 Phil. 169), the Court held that such a waiver of legal venue is valid and effective as it is merely a personal privilege and not contrary to public policy [10, 11]. Consequently, the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion in denying the motion to dismiss based on improper venue [11].

The writ of prohibition is GRANTED, and the respondent trial court is ordered to dismiss the complaint of G. A. Machineries, Inc. without prejudice to filing in the proper court [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Concepcion, C.J., Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro, JJ., concurred [12].
