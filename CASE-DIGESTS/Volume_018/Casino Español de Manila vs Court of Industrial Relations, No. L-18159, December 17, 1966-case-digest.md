I. CAPTION
CASINO ESPAÑOL DE MANILA, petitioner, vs. THE HONORABLE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and MAMERTO FERIA, respondents., G.R. No. L-18159, December 17, 1966, 18 SCRA 1111, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Mamerto Feria was employed as a cook by petitioner Casino Español de Manila, a non-stock corporation organized not for profit but to promote closer relationships among Spanish residents and provide service to its members. Feria was dismissed and subsequently filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) seeking reinstatement, back wages, and differential pay for services rendered on Sundays, legal holidays, and at night.

Casino Español contested the action, arguing that the CIR lacked jurisdiction and that there was no cause of action. The petitioner contended that the Eight-Hour Labor Law (Commonwealth Act No. 444) applies only to employers engaged in an "industry or occupation" for gain or profit. Since Casino Español is a non-profit entity, it argued it should be exempt from the law's coverage, citing previous jurisprudence exempting charitable institutions.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a non-stock, non-profit corporation like Casino Español de Manila is subject to the provisions of the Eight-Hour Labor Law (Commonwealth Act No. 444).

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the CIR, holding that the petitioner is subject to the Eight-Hour Labor Law.

The Court clarified that the requirement in Section 2 of Com. Act No. 444 ("employed in any industry or occupation") refers to the **employee**, not the employer [1]. Respondent Feria, working as a cook, was engaged in an occupation [2, 3]. Conversely, Section 4, which applies to the **employer** ("person, firm or corporation... or place or center of labor"), does not require the employer to be engaged in an industry or for profit; it is sufficient that the employer is the entity in whose favor the labor is rendered [1, 4].

Furthermore, the Court distinguished Casino Español from charitable or educational institutions (e.g., Red Cross, Boy Scouts, UST Hospital) previously held exempt due to their "benevolent and lofty purpose" [5]. The petitioner's purpose is limited to providing comfort and service to its members and guests, and upon dissolution, its accumulated profits would inure to the benefit of its members [2, 6]. Therefore, it is not exempt from the law. The CIR has jurisdiction over claims for reinstatement and overtime pay under the Eight-Hour Labor Law [7, 8].

Decision affirmed.
