I. CAPTION
ANTONIO Y. MAYUGA v. CESAR R. MARAVILLA and AQUILINO GALLOMOSA, G.R. No. L-18826, December 17, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On March 22, 1960, a criminal information for Homicide Through Reckless Imprudence was filed against Dr. Antonio Mayuga for allegedly failing to remove a surgical pack during a cesarean operation on Avelina Gallomosa, causing her death [1]. Respondent Justice of the Peace (JP) Cesar Maravilla conducted a preliminary examination, found a *prima facie* case, and ordered Mayuga’s arrest [2]. Mayuga moved to quash the information, arguing that the evidence—specifically an unauthenticated autopsy report and death certificates—was hearsay and insufficient [2], [3]. The JP denied the motion [2]. Mayuga then filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Romblon, alleging grave abuse of discretion [2]. The CFI dismissed the petition for lack of merit without requiring the respondents to answer [4]. Mayuga appealed, and the case was certified to the Supreme Court on questions of law [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Justice of the Peace committed grave abuse of discretion in finding probable cause based on the evidence presented.
2. W/N the CFI erred in dismissing the petition for certiorari without requiring an answer.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that a preliminary investigation is not the occasion for the full and exhaustive display of the parties' evidence; it is intended only to present such evidence as may engender a well-grounded belief that an offense has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof (*Hashim v. Boncan*) [5]. The proceeding is generally *ex parte* [6], and a justice of the peace is not prohibited from finding probable cause based on the statement of the prosecuting attorney or other persons entitled to credit [5], [7].

2. **NO.** The dismissal of a petition for certiorari is proper even before an answer is filed where the attention of the court is called to the fact that the petition is deficient in substance or appears to be without merit from its own allegations (*Santos v. Galang*; *Arvisu v. Vergara*) [8], [9].

The order of dismissal appealed from is affirmed [10].
