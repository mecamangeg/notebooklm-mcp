I. CAPTION
AURORA CAMARA VDA. DE ZUBIRI v. WENCESLAO ZUBIRI alias BEN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16745, December 17, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Aurora Camara Vda. de Zubiri filed a complaint against defendant Wenceslao Zubiri for the recovery of her alleged share in two commercial lots, claiming they were conjugal properties. Subsequently, four pleadings were filed: (1) Wenceslao's Answer, signed by him alone; (2) a Stipulation of Facts; (3) a Motion to Render Judgment on the Pleadings; and (4) the Answer of co-defendant Standard Vacuum Oil Co. Notably, the Stipulation and Motion were signed by the plaintiff with counsel, but by Wenceslao without counsel. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff based on the Stipulation of Facts.

Wenceslao, now assisted by counsel, filed a petition to set aside the judgment. He alleged that the plaintiff's counsel had prepared the pleadings and induced him to sign them while he was gravely ill (suffering from fever) and without legal assistance. He also argued the action was barred by a prior judgment declaring him the sole heir of the decedent. Wenceslao’s counsel moved to postpone the hearing on this petition due to conflicting commitments, but the trial court denied the postponement and the petition to set aside the judgment.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in denying the motion for postponement.
2. W/N the trial court erred in denying the petition to set aside the judgment given the allegations of fraud and irregularity.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The denial of the motion for postponement prevented rather than served the ends of justice. The motion was the first filed by appellant's counsel, submitted a week prior to the hearing with notice to the opposing party, and was based on a reasonable ground (contractual commitments). Although postponement is discretionary, such power must be exercised prudently and justly.

2. **YES.** The petition to set aside the judgment should have been granted. The Court found the allegations serious, particularly that the plaintiff’s counsel prepared the defendant’s pleadings. The active participation of a lawyer in one party's affairs while representing the opposing party is brazenly unethical and constitutes malpractice (*Cantorne v. Ducusin*). The Canons of Legal Ethics explicitly declare it unprofessional to represent conflicting interests.

Furthermore, the "total and unqualified repudiation" of the defendant's interests in the Answer, signed while he was unassisted and allegedly ill, should have prompted the trial court to inquire into his capacity and the validity of his consent. Finally, the lower court should have determined the validity of the defense of *res judicata* regarding the prior inheritance adjudication.

The Order of the lower court is **SET ASIDE** and the case is remanded for trial on the merits.
