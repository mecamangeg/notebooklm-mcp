I. CAPTION
MOBIL PHILIPPINES EXPLORATION, INC. v. CUSTOMS ARRASTRE SERVICE and BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-23139, December 17, 1966, 18 SCRA 1120, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
In November 1962, four cases of rotary drill parts consigned to Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. (Mobil) arrived in Manila and were discharged to the custody of the Customs Arrastre Service (CAS), the unit of the Bureau of Customs (BOC) handling arrastre operations. The CAS delivered only three cases to Mobil; one case valued at P18,493.37 was lost.

Mobil filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against CAS and BOC to recover the value of the lost merchandise. The defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that they are not persons under the law and cannot be sued. The CFI dismissed the complaint. Mobil appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the BOC is discharging proprietary functions by operating the arrastre service and, therefore, can be sued by private individuals.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Customs Arrastre Service and the Bureau of Customs have the capacity to be sued.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that neither the Bureau of Customs nor the Customs Arrastre Service can be sued. Under Section 1, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, a defendant must be a natural or juridical person, or an entity authorized by law to be sued [1]. The BOC and CAS are merely parts of the machinery of the national government and possess no separate personality of their own [2].

Although the arrastre service may be deemed a proprietary function, it is a "necessary incident" to the primary governmental function of the BOC, which is the assessment and collection of revenues [3, 4]. The Court held that "sovereign immunity, granted as to the end, should not be denied as to the necessary means to that end" [4]. Since the government cannot be sued without its consent, and there is no statute waiving this immunity for the BOC, the suit cannot prosper [5]. The proper remedy for the consignee is to file a money claim with the General Auditing Office pursuant to Commonwealth Act No. 327 [5].

The order of dismissal is affirmed [6].
