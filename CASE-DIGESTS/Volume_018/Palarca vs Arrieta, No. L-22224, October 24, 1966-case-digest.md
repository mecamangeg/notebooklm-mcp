**I. CAPTION**
ALFREDO BER. PALARCA v. HON. ABUNDIO ARRIETA, PEDRO G. PEREZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22224, October 24, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Alfredo Palarca and respondent Jose Neri were candidates for lieutenant-governor of Camiguin Subprovince in the November 12, 1963 elections [1]. During the canvass, the Nacionalista Party representative alleged discrepancies in the election returns and moved for a judicial recount, which the Provincial Board of Canvassers refused [1]. Palarca filed a petition for judicial recount with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Misamis Oriental, presided by respondent Judge Arrieta [1, 2].

Upon examination, the CFI found that for Precincts 9, 14, 18, 19, and 25, the copies of the returns for the Provincial Treasurer, Municipal Treasurer, and the Ballot Box all tallied with one another [3]. The only discrepancy found was in the copy furnished to the Nacionalista Party [3]. Consequently, the CFI dismissed the petition for recount regarding these precincts [4]. Palarca filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court to annul the dismissal order [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the copy of election returns furnished to a political party constitutes "another copy or other authentic copies" under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code to justify a judicial recount. [5]

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the copy of the election returns given to a political party is not one of those contemplated by Section 163 of the Revised Election Code for purposes of a judicial recount [6].

The Court affirmed the doctrine in *Acuña v. Golez*, stating that the phrase "another copy or other authentic copies" refers only to the four copies prescribed in Section 150 of the Code: one for the ballot box, one for the municipal treasurer, one for the provincial treasurer, and one for the Commission on Elections [7]. The law did not prescribe any "other" copies [7]. The Court reasoned that Section 163 must be construed restrictively to avoid delays in proclamation that could leave offices without incumbents or allow defeated candidates to extend their tenure [8, 9]. Furthermore, copies given to political parties are susceptible to tampering to suit partisan objectives [6].

The petition was dismissed, and the writ of preliminary injunction was lifted [10].
