I. CAPTION
ANTONIO J. VILLEGAS, as Mayor of Manila, and THE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRIAL SUPPLIERS (FAR EAST), INCORPORATED v. THE AUDITOR GENERAL and CITY AUDITOR JOSE ERESTAIN, G.R. No. L-21352, November 29, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
The City of Manila appropriated funds for the purchase of 20 refuse collection trucks. A public bidding was held by the Committee on Awards, composed of the City Mayor, City Auditor, and City Treasurer, as required by Republic Act No. 2264. At the meeting where the award was decided, Mayor Villegas was absent but represented by his technical assistant, Fernando Manalastas. The Committee, with the presence of the City Treasurer and City Auditor, awarded the contract to Business & Industrial Suppliers, Inc. (BISI).

Competitors CCH and GAMI protested the award to the Auditor General. The Auditor General’s office, through a technical committee, found CCH’s bid more advantageous and directed City Auditor Erestain to withhold the pre-audit of the voucher. Consequently, Erestain refused to sign the voucher for P571,310.65 needed to open the letter of credit for BISI, despite the contract being approved by the Mayor and attested to by the City Auditor earlier. Villegas and BISI filed a petition for *mandamus* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to compel the audit. The CFI ruled in favor of Villegas, ordering the respondents to sign the voucher. The respondents appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the award to BISI was valid despite the Mayor delegating his duties as a member of the Committee on Awards to a technical assistant.
2. W/N the Auditor General has the discretion to refuse to pass in audit a voucher for a perfected contract on the ground that it is unwise or another bid is more advantageous.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While the Mayor’s powers on the Committee on Awards are discretionary and judicial in nature—and thus cannot be delegated to a technical assistant like Manalastas—the award remained valid. The Committee is composed of three members, and two constitute a quorum to transact business. The City Treasurer and City Auditor were present and voted for the award; their action as a majority is valid. Furthermore, Mayor Villegas subsequently ratified the award by approving the purchase order and insisting on the contract.

2. **NO.** The authority of the Auditor General is limited by Section 2, Article XI of the Constitution to auditing expenditures regarding appropriations, conformity with law, and proper delivery. Once these requirements are met, his duty to approve the voucher is ministerial. He has no discretion to disapprove payment because he believes a contract is unwise or unreasonable. If he finds an expenditure "irregular, unnecessary, excessive, or extravagant," his constitutional duty is merely to bring it to the attention of the proper administrative officer, not to veto it (*Guevara v. Gimenez*). Since the contract was legally entered into and supported by an appropriation, *mandamus* lies to compel the audit.

The judgment of the Court of First Instance is **AFFIRMED**.
