I. CAPTION
JESUS AGUIRRE v. VICTOR S. PHENG, in his capacity as General Manager of the LEONORA & COMPANY, and NATIONAL SHIPYARDS AND STEEL CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-20851, September 3, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Jesus Aguirre purchased a steel tank from the Aldabas for P900.00 but failed to take immediate physical possession. The Aldabas subsequently sold the same tank to Zosimo Gabriel, who then sold it to Leonora & Company for P2,500.00. Acting in good faith, Leonora & Company spent P11,299.00 to recondition and improve the tank, later selling it to the National Shipyards and Steel Corporation (NASSCO) for P14,500.00.

Aguirre filed a suit (Civil Case No. 24914) asserting ownership. The trial court declared Aguirre the absolute owner and ordered the delivery of the tank to him, or the payment of P900.00 if delivery was impossible; this judgment became final. In a related case regarding the purchase price (Civil Case No. 27988), the trial court ruled that if the tank were delivered to Aguirre, he must reimburse Leonora & Company P11,299.00 for the improvements. If delivery was not possible, Aguirre would receive only P900.00, while Leonora & Company would receive P11,299.00 from NASSCO. The Court of Appeals affirmed this decision. Aguirre petitioned, arguing that under Article 440 regarding accession, he is entitled to the full P14,500.00 value without reimbursement.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Aguirre is entitled to the full value of the tank including the improvements made by Leonora & Company without reimbursement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. The Court held that this is a case of **accession by specification** where Leonora & Company, as a purchaser acting in good faith, spent P11,299.00 for the reconditioning of the tank later adjudged to belong to Aguirre.

Under **Article 466 of the New Civil Code**, while the owner of the principal thing ordinarily acquires the accessory, the rule is different when works or improvements are made by one acting in good faith. In such cases, the owner who acquires the accessory must indemnify the former owner for its value. To grant Aguirre the full P14,500.00 price (which includes the value of improvements) would allow him to unjustly enrich himself at the expense of Leonora & Company. Furthermore, the judgment in Civil Case No. 24914, ordering NASSCO to pay Aguirre only P900.00 if delivery was impossible, had already become final and constitutes *res judicata*.

The petition is dismissed and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
