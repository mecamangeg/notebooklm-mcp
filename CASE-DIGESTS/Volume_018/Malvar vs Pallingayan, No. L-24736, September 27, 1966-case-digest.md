I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO MALVAR and NATIVIDAD LOPEZ v. PABLO PALLINGAYAN and CATALINO CHUA, G.R. No. L-24736, September 27, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants spouses Malvar filed an action to annul a contract of lease executed in 1962 between defendants Pallingayan and Chua over a building in Olongapo, Zambales [1]. The Malvars claimed they were the true owners of the building by virtue of a deed of sale executed by Pallingayan in their favor in 1961 [1]. The defendants moved to dismiss on the ground of *res judicata*, citing two prior Civil Cases (Nos. 2399 and 2359) involving the same building [1]. In those previous cases, the Malvars had intervened as plaintiffs to assert their ownership against Pallingayan and others [2, 3]. However, on October 4, 1962, the lower court dismissed the Malvars' intervention in both cases because they and their counsel failed to appear at the scheduled hearing despite due notice [4]. The Malvars did not appeal this order of dismissal [5]. The trial court in the present case sustained the defense of *res judicata* and dismissed the complaint, prompting this appeal [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the plaintiffs’ intervention in the previous cases constitutes *res judicata* barring the present action.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal. The Court ruled that all the requisites of *res judicata* were present: (a) a final judgment or order; (b) jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties; (c) a judgment on the merits; and (d) identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action [7].

Specifically regarding the third element, the Court applied **Section 3, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court**, which states that if a plaintiff fails to appear at the time of trial or to prosecute his action, the dismissal "shall have the effect of an adjudication upon the merits, unless otherwise provided by the court" [8]. Since the Malvars failed to prosecute their intervention in the previous cases and did not appeal the dismissal order, it became a final judgment on the merits regarding their claim of ownership [5, 8]. Consequently, they are barred from re-litigating the same ownership claim against Pallingayan in this subsequent suit.

The order appealed from is affirmed [5].
