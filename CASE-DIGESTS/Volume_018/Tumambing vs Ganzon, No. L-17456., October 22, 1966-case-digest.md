I. CAPTION
GELACIO E. TUMAMBING v. MAURO GANZON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17456, October 22, 1966, 18 SCRA 411, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On January 30, 1959, defendant Mauro Ganzon was served summons in a civil case filed by plaintiff Gelacio Tumambing. Two days before the expiration of the filing period, Ganzon filed an urgent *ex parte* motion for a 10-day extension to file an answer, citing that his counsel had just been retained and needed time to study the case. The trial court denied this motion on February 21, 1959, and declared Ganzon in default.

Ganzon received the default order on February 25, 1959, and on the same day filed a verified motion to set aside the order of default accompanied by his answer. The trial court denied this motion. Subsequently, the court rendered a decision based on a commissioner's findings, holding Ganzon liable for over P47,000. Ganzon filed a petition for relief with an affidavit of merits, explaining his counsel's absence in Zambales and lack of intent to delay, but this was also denied. Ganzon appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved only questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to set aside the order of default.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the refusal to set aside the order of default constituted a grave abuse of discretion.

Citing *Bañares v. Flordeliza*, the Court ruled that when a motion to set aside a default order is made without loss of time, before the hearing on the merits, and is accompanied by a sworn statement of merits and evidence of a valid defense, it is an abuse of discretion to deny it. In this case, Ganzon filed his motion to set aside immediately upon receiving the notice of default and before trial.

The Court emphasized that default judgments are not looked upon with favor and should only be used as a final expedient to induce a defendant to join issues. Under Section 7, Rule 11 of the Rules of Court, trial courts have discretion to allow answers even after time limits expire. Following *Coombs v. Santos* and *Macaraig v. Dy Sun*, this discretion must be exercised to subserve the ends of justice. Since granting the motion would not prejudice the plaintiff, there was no intent to unduly delay, and the amount involved was substantial (P47,000), the default should have been lifted to give the defendant his day in court.

**WHEREFORE**, the orders appealed from are set aside, and the case is remanded to the court of origin to allow the defendant to answer the complaint and present evidence.
