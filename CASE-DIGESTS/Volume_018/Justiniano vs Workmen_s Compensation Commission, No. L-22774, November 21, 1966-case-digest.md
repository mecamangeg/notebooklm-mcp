I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO JUSTINIANO v. THE HONORABLE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and CEBU STEVEDORING CO., INC., G.R. No. L-22774, November 21, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Francisco Justiniano was employed as a sailor by Cebu Stevedoring Co., Inc. starting in 1946, with duties involving cleaning, watching barges, and heavy manual labor [1]. On June 20, 1958, at 4:00 A.M. while on duty, he suffered an attack of high blood pressure, resulting in hemiplegia (paralysis) on his left side [2, 3]. Consequently, he resigned and filed a claim for compensation. The Hearing Officer awarded him total disability compensation [4]. However, on appeal, the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed the decision and absolved the employer, ruling that Justiniano failed to prove his illness was caused or aggravated by his employment [4, 5]. Justiniano appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the illness (hypertension) which supervened during employment is compensable despite the lack of direct evidence that it arose out of or was aggravated by the employment.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that under Section 44(1) of the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act 3428), there is a rebuttable presumption that a claim is compensable [6]. Once the claimant establishes that the illness supervened *during* the time of his employment, the law presumes it arose out of or was aggravated by said employment [6]. The burden of proof shifts to the employer to demonstrate substantial evidence to the contrary [6].

In this case, it was undisputed that the attack occurred during Justiniano's "tour of duty" and there was no evidence of pre-existing hypertension [7]. Since the employer failed to rebut the statutory presumption, the illness is compensable. The WCC decision was reversed, and the Hearing Officer's award was reinstated [8].
