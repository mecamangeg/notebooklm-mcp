I. CAPTION
ALICIA S. GONZALES v. THE SECRETARY OF PUBLIC WORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS, DISTRICT ENGINEER, Province of Davao and LUCIA O. TOLENTINO, G.R. No. L-21988, September 30, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alicia S. Gonzales constructed dams in Davao. Upon a complaint filed by respondent Lucia O. Tolentino, the Secretary of Public Works and Communications (respondent) ultimately ordered the demolition of said dams. The Office of the President affirmed this decision, and the District Engineer of Davao notified Gonzales that the demolition would proceed.

Gonzales filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao (Civil Case No. 3689) to prevent the demolition. The CFI of Davao dismissed the case on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. Relying on the cases of *Samar Mining Co. v. Arnaldo* and *Acosta v. Alvendia*, the lower court reasoned that it could not enjoin the Secretary of Public Works, whose office is in Manila [1-3]. Gonzales appealed the order of dismissal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance of Davao has jurisdiction to enjoin the Secretary of Public Works and Communications from enforcing an order to be executed in Davao.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the CFI of Davao has jurisdiction because the acts sought to be restrained (the demolition of dams) were about to be performed within the territorial boundaries of the province of Davao, where the court sits [4].

The lower court misapplied the rulings in *Acosta* and *Samar Mining*. Those cases held that the CFI of Manila did *not* have jurisdiction to restrain acts committed *outside* Manila (in Nueva Ecija and Cebu, respectively) [3, 5]. Under Section 44(h) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 and Rule 67, Section 4 of the Rules of Court, the authority of a Court of First Instance to issue writs of injunction is limited to acts committed or about to be committed within its territorial boundaries [3, 5]. Since the demolition was to take place in Davao, the CFI of Davao—not Manila—had the authority to hear the case, regardless of the fact that the Department Head was in Manila [4, 6].

The order appealed from is **REVERSED** and the record remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [4].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro concurred [7].
