I. CAPTION
MANILA ELECTRIC COMPANY v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, G.R. Nos. L-24762, L-24841, L-24854, & L-24872, November 14, 1966, 18 SCRA 651, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On October 22, 1964, Meralco filed an application with the Public Service Commission (PSC) for a revised (increased) rate schedule to ensure a fair return on the present value of its assets and to attract foreign capital necessary for expanding its facilities. The Republic of the Philippines, the City of Manila, and Ricardo Rosal opposed the petition. On March 15, 1965, the PSC rendered a decision disapproving Meralco's proposed schedule but authorizing a modified rate increase. Following motions for reconsideration by the oppositors, the PSC issued an Order on July 16, 1965, which "reconsidered" the decision and reduced the authorized increases for residential customers. Meralco, the Republic, the City of Manila, and Rosal all appealed to the Supreme Court. Meralco moved to dismiss the appeals of the Republic and the City, arguing they were filed beyond the 15-day period prescribed in Section 36 of the Public Service Act (Commonwealth Act No. 146), calculated from the denial of a motion for reconsideration. The oppositors argued that since their motions were effectively granted by the modification of rates, the 30-day period under Rule 44 of the Rules of Court applied.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appeals of the Republic and the City of Manila were filed on time.
2. W/N the PSC properly authorized rate increases based on a 12% rate of return.
3. W/N the "present or market value" theory is the valid basis for computing Meralco's capital assets.
4. W/N the PSC has jurisdiction over Meralco in areas outside the City of Manila.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The 15-day period provided in Section 36 of Commonwealth Act No. 146 governs only when a motion for reconsideration has been *denied*. When the motion is *granted* (as in this case, where the PSC modified the rates in the July 16 Order), it results in a "new decision" in contemplation of law. Consequently, the proper period for appeal is **thirty (30) days** from notice of said new decision, pursuant to Rule 44, Section 1 of the Rules of Court [1]. Since the appeals were filed within this 30-day period, they were timely [2].

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the 12% rate of return fixed by the PSC. The rate of return depends on existing conditions, and Philippine decisions have consistently adopted the 12% rate for public utilities [3]. The Court noted that prevailing interest rates on loans in the Philippines are generally higher than in the United States, and Meralco would be unable to borrow necessary funds for expansion if its returns were fixed at a lower rate [4]. The increases were justified by the need to prevent deterioration of service and meet the demands of a growing population and industry [5].

3. **YES.** The PSC correctly adopted the "present or market value" theory as the basis for computing earnings, rather than the "historical cost" theory proposed by oppositor Rosal. This theory is consistent with the practice adhered to in Philippine jurisdiction and upheld in an uninterrupted line of decisions, such as *Inchausti v. Public Utility Commission* and *Metropolitan Water District v. PSC* [6]. The Court rejected the argument that *Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co.* (320 U.S. 591) discarded this theory, clarifying that said case merely refused to interfere with the commission's choice of formula provided the "end result" was reasonable [7].

4. **YES.** The alleged lack of a legislative franchise for suburbs or a certificate of public convenience affects Meralco's cause of action, not the PSC's jurisdiction [8], [9]. Furthermore, under Act No. 484 and R.A. No. 150, Meralco is authorized to operate in the "City of Manila and its suburbs" [9]. A certificate of public convenience was not a prerequisite because Meralco was already in operation under Act No. 484 (1902) before the first public utility law (Act No. 2307) took effect in 1913 [10].

Decision and order affirmed.
