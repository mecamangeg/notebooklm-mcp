I. CAPTION
ADOLFO RACAZA v. SUSANA REALTY, INC., G.R. No. L-20330, December 22, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Adolfo Racaza leased a portion of a lot in Pasay City owned by Respondent Susana Realty, Inc. starting in 1952. Racaza claimed the agreement allowed him to stay as long as he paid the P15.00 monthly rent, while the nature of the lease was essentially month-to-month. On December 16, 1955, Susana Realty demanded Racaza to vacate; an ejectment suit was filed but dismissed for failure to prosecute [1, 2].

On December 17, 1957, Susana Realty sent a second letter demanding the surrender of the premises [2]. On February 19, 1958, Respondent filed a new complaint for ejectment in the Municipal Court of Pasay City [2]. Racaza argued that the Municipal Court lacked jurisdiction because the one-year period for unlawful detainer should be reckoned from the first demand in 1955 or when he stopped paying rent in July 1955 [3, 4]. The Municipal Court and Court of First Instance ordered his eviction [5, 6]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the eviction but awarded Racaza P3,500.00 as reimbursement for half the value of his house, applying Article 1678 of the Civil Code [7]. Racaza appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the action was time-barred and claiming full reimbursement under Article 448 [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Municipal Court had jurisdiction over the ejectment suit filed in 1958 despite the first demand to vacate being made in 1955.
2. W/N the lessee is entitled to full reimbursement for improvements under Article 448 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The one-year period for filing an unlawful detainer case is reckoned from the second demand to vacate. The lessor has the right to waive the cause of action based on the first demand and allow the lessee to remain in the premises [10]. Furthermore, since the lease was on a month-to-month basis, it expired at the end of every month (Article 1687, Civil Code). Consequently, a demand to vacate was not even necessary for the expiration of the term, unlike in cases of failure to pay rent (Article 1669, Civil Code; *Co Tiamco v. Diaz*) [11, 12]. The demand merely served to negate any inference of an extension of the lease [10].

2. **NO.** Article 448, in relation to Article 546 of the Civil Code, applies only to possessors in good faith. Lessees are not possessors in good faith because they know their occupation is temporary and limited to the duration of the lease [9]. A lessee's right to improvements is governed exclusively by Article 1678, which allows reimbursement of only one-half of the value of useful improvements if the lessor chooses to appropriate them [9].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
