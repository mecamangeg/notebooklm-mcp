I. CAPTION
NATIONAL MARKETING CORPORATION v. PRISCO WORKERS UNION, ET AL., and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-19945, December 29, 1966, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) rendered partial decisions in 1953 and 1955 ordering the Price Stabilization Corporation (PRISCO) to pay overtime and holiday compensation to its employees. When PRISCO was abolished, its assets and liabilities were transferred to the National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO). On May 20, 1960, the CIR issued an order directing NAMARCO to pay specific employees listed in "Annex A" for services rendered from January 1, 1956.

On January 10, 1961, the Prisco Workers Union filed a petition (Case No. 840-V[1]) to extend the benefits of the May 20, 1960 order to other NAMARCO employees and General Auditing Office (GAO) personnel assigned to NAMARCO. NAMARCO opposed, arguing that the claims had prescribed under the three-year prescriptive period of R.A. 1993, and that no employer-employee relationship existed with the GAO personnel. The CIR *en banc* ruled that the claims had not prescribed and that GAO employees were entitled to overtime compensation. NAMARCO appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claims for overtime and holiday work have prescribed.
2. W/N GAO employees assigned to NAMARCO are entitled to overtime compensation from NAMARCO.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the petition filed on January 10, 1961, was not a new cause of action but a petition for the execution of the partial decision of May 20, 1960. Since the petition was filed less than eight months from the date of the latest execution order, the claim had not prescribed. The Court viewed the action as a continuation of the original case to implement the benefits for employees similarly situated to those in the May 20, 1960 order.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that GAO employees, even if paid by government-owned corporations like NAMARCO, are not corporate employees. They are agents of the Government, appointed and supervised by the Auditor General, and have independent tenure. Consequently, they are not covered by the Eight-Hour Labor Law but by the Revised Administrative Code (Sections 566 and 259). Citing *Batungbakal v. National Development Co.* and *NAMARCO v. CIR*, the Court declared they are not entitled to overtime pay from the corporation as there is no employer-employee relationship.

The order and resolution of the CIR were **AFFIRMED** regarding the NAMARCO employees' non-prescription but **REVERSED** regarding the GAO employees' entitlement.
