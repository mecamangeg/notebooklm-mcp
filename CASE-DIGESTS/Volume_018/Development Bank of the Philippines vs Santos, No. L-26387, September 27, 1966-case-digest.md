I. CAPTION
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SPOUSES ADRIANO V. SANTOS, MARTINA HABACON, and EVARISTO PICAZO, G.R. No. L-26387, September 27, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Appellee Evaristo Picazo moved to dismiss the appeal of the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) on the ground that the record on appeal failed to show it was filed within the reglementary period. The record indicated that DBP received the lower court’s order of dismissal on March 16, 1966, filed a Motion for Reconsideration on March 23, 1966, and that said motion was denied on April 11, 1966 [1, 2]. However, the record on appeal failed to disclose the specific date when DBP received the notice of the order denying its Motion for Reconsideration [2, 3]. DBP opposed the motion, arguing that the record was actually filed on time based on an extension granted by the lower court, and that the omission was cured by the appellee's failure to object during the approval of the record [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed for failure of the record on appeal to disclose the date when the appellant received the notice of the order denying the motion for reconsideration.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court granted the motion and dismissed the appeal. The date when the appellant received notice of the order denying the motion for reconsideration is essential for determining whether the record on appeal was filed on time [5, 6]. The failure of the record to disclose this date violates Rule 50, paragraph (a), in connection with Rule 56, Section 1, and Rule 41, Section 6 of the Revised Rules of Court [1, 6].

The Court applied the doctrine in *Government of the Philippines v. Antonio*, holding that the burden is on the appellant to show the appeal is timely. The requirement under Rule 41, Section 6 to include data showing the appeal was perfected on time is mandatory and jurisdictional [7]. Without such data, the appellate court acquires no jurisdiction, and the trial court's subsequent approval of the record cannot restore jurisdiction already lost [7].

Appeal dismissed [8].
