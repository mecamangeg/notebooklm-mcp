I. CAPTION
CONSOLACION INSURANCE AND SURETY COMPANY, INC. v. HON. ANGEL H. MOJICA, et al., G.R. No. L-21282, September 29, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Claro Cortes filed a collection suit against Natalia L. Sison and Sergio Mendoza (Kapit Bahay Restaurant). A writ of preliminary attachment was issued against the defendants but was dissolved upon the filing of a counterbond by petitioner Consolacion Insurance and Surety Co., Inc. [1]. The trial court subsequently rendered judgment based on a compromise agreement between Cortes and the defendants [2]. Cortes later moved for execution against the defendants and the petitioner surety for the unpaid balance [3]. Petitioner objected, arguing it was not bound by the compromise agreement executed without its consent and claimed the right of exhaustion [3, 4]. The trial court issued the writ of execution, prompting petitioner to file a petition for certiorari [4]. During the proceedings, Cortes manifested that the defendants had substantially paid the judgment and he was no longer interested in proceeding against the surety [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition to set aside the writ of execution against the surety has become moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the case had become moot and academic. Respondent Cortes expressly admitted that the principal debtors had made arrangements for the payment of the balance and that he was "not interested in proceeding against the petitioner for its liability under the bond" [5]. Where the principal debtor has made arrangements for the payment of the judgment to the creditor, the petition for certiorari to set aside the writ of execution against the surety becomes moot [6, 7].

**Disposition:** Case dismissed.
