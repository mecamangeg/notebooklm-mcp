I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. VENANCIO H. AQUINO, G.R. No. L-23908, October 29, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Venancio H. Aquino, counsel for the plaintiff in Civil Case No. N-151 (a suit for damages for libel), filed a "Reply and Answer to Counterclaim" on July 27, 1960 [1]. In this pleading, Aquino responded to the defendant Thomas Gonzales's claims of good faith by quoting a Supreme Court opinion, referring to Gonzales as an "imposture that only ignorants, blackhands and other mental pachyderms (like him) can swallow" and an "impertinent assaulter of plaintiff's reputation" [2], [3]. Gonzales filed a criminal complaint for libel against Aquino based on these statements [4]. Aquino filed a motion to quash, arguing that the allegations were absolutely privileged [5]. The Court of First Instance of Cagayan dismissed the case, ruling that the statements were made in the course of judicial proceedings and were relevant to the issues [6]. The prosecution appealed the order of dismissal to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the allegedly defamatory statements made by the lawyer in his responsive pleading are absolutely privileged.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Statements made in the course of judicial proceedings are absolutely privileged—regardless of defamatory tenor or the presence of malice—if they are relevant, pertinent, or material to the cause in hand or subject of the inquiry [7]. The privilege is granted for the administration of justice so that lawyers may speak their minds freely without incurring the risk of criminal prosecution or civil liability [8].

The Court held that relevancy should be liberally considered and words should not be scrutinized with microscopic intensity [9]. In the civil case, the subject of inquiry was whether Gonzales acted with malice or in good faith [10]. Aquino's statements, characterizing Gonzales's defense as a "shameless pretense" and describing him as a "blockhead" (a person deficient in understanding) and a "mental pachyderm" (a distorted, insensible mind), were responsive to the defendant's allegations and reasonably pertained to the subject of inquiry [11], [12], [13]. The Court corrected the clerical error of "blackhands" to "blockheads" based on the original jurisprudence quoted by Aquino [12].

The Order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED** [14].
