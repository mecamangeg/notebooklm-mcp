I. CAPTION
MILAGROS PACHECO RIVERA v. HON. ARSENIO SANTOS, Presiding Judge, Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch IV, The Sheriff of the City of Manila, and GLORIFICADOR R. TIGLAO, G.R. No. L-24563, November 29, 1966, 18 SCRA 870, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Glorificador R. Tiglao filed a petition for letters of administration for the estate of his deceased wife, Emerenciana S. Pacheco-Tiglao [1]. He subsequently moved *ex parte* to be appointed special administrator [2]. Milagros Pacheco-Rivera, the deceased’s sister, opposed the motion, claiming that as an heir and co-owner, she was entitled to three-fourths of the estate and should be the administratrix [2].

The Court of First Instance of Manila (Judge Santos) issued an order appointing Tiglao as special administrator without passing upon the issue of his fitness or unfitness [3]. The court stated this was solely to enhance the early settlement of the estate, specifically to pay taxes and debts, and to administer the "D. R. Pacheco Private Detective and Special Watchman Agency" and other unsettled portions of the estate [3]. Rivera moved for reconsideration, which was denied [4]. The court further granted Tiglao’s motion for authority to administer the Detective Agency [5]. Rivera filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, arguing the judge abused his discretion by appointing Tiglao without determining his fitness and by including properties (the Agency and a house and lot) that she claimed to own as a co-owner and heir of their deceased father, Donato Pacheco [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court may appoint a special administrator without first passing upon the issue of the appointee's fitness or unfitness.
2. W/N the special administrator’s powers should extend to properties claimed by the oppositor to be outside the decedent's estate.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the appointment of a special administrator lies entirely in the sound discretion of the court [7]. Under Section 1, Rule 80 of the Rules of Court, a special administrator may be appointed to take possession and charge of the estate when there is a delay in granting letters testamentary or of administration [8]. Because a special administrator has specific and limited powers—primarily to preserve the estate for the regular administrator—the court is not required to first pass upon and resolve issues of fitness or unfitness as would be necessary for a regular administrator [9]. Thus, the lower court's order appointing Tiglao was valid regarding the payment of taxes and preservation of the estate [9].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the "D. R. Pacheco Private Detective and Special Watchman Agency" and the house and lot in Sampaloc, Manila, should be excluded from the coverage of the special administrator’s powers [10]. The record indicated these properties were likely owned by the late Donato R. Pacheco (the father of the deceased and the petitioner) and that Rivera claimed a substantial ownership share as heir and co-owner [6, 11]. Since these properties did not clearly form part of the decedent's estate, they must be excluded from the special administrator's control pending final adjudication of their ownership [10].

The petition was **denied in part** (sustaining the appointment) and **granted in part** (excluding the specific properties from administration). The respondent Judge was directed to appoint a regular administrator without further delay [12].
