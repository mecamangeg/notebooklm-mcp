I. CAPTION
GO TIAN CHAI v. THE COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION and the OVERSEER, Detention Station of the Bureau of Immigration, G.R. No. L-20645, September 22, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Go Tian Chai, a Chinese national, entered the Philippines as a temporary visitor in 1947 and overstayed. In 1951, the Board of Commissioners ordered his deportation to Formosa (Taiwan). Although the warrant was issued in 1951, he was only taken into custody on October 8, 1962.

On November 26, 1962, while detained pending deportation, petitioner filed a petition for *habeas corpus* in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. He argued that his detention was unreasonable as deportation was unlikely in the near future due to diplomatic negotiations, citing *Borovsky v. Commissioner*. The CFI denied the petition but ordered that if the Commissioner could not deport him within six months, he should be released on bail. The Commissioner appealed solely the portion of the decision granting bail.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court has the authority to order the release of a deportable alien on bail if deportation is not effected within a fixed period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that aliens in deportation proceedings have no inherent right to bail. Section 37(9)(e) of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940 (Com. Act No. 613, as amended) provides that an alien under arrest "may be released under bond or under such other conditions as may be imposed by the Commissioner of Immigration."

The use of the word "may" indicates that the grant of bail is permissive and wholly within the exclusive discretion of the Commissioner, not the courts. Courts do not administer immigration laws [1, 2]. Furthermore, the doctrine in *Borovsky* does not apply because the petitioner is not a stateless individual but a national of Formosa. The Court reiterated the ruling in *Tan Seng Pao v. Commissioner of Immigration*, stating that detention pending deportation is not "unjust" even if delayed by diplomatic negotiations, as such delay is not the fault of the Philippine government [3, 4].

The decision of the lower court ordering release on bail is ANNULLED and SET ASIDE, and the dismissal of the petition for *habeas corpus* is AFFIRMED.
