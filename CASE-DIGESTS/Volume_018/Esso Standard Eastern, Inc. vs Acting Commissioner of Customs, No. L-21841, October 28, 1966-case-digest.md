**I. CAPTION**
ESSO STANDARD EASTERN, INC. v. ACTING COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-21841, October 28, 1966, 18 SCRA 488, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Esso Standard Eastern, Inc., engaged in the industry of processing gasoline and manufacturing lubricating oil, imported pump parts in 1956. It paid P722.84 as a special import tax but subsequently claimed a refund [1]. Esso argued that the articles were exempt under Section 6 of Republic Act No. 1394, which grants exemptions for machinery and spare parts "for the use of industries" [2].

The imported pump parts were installed in gasoline stations owned by Esso but leased to and operated by independent dealers. These dealers used the pumps to dispense gasoline from underground tanks into customers' vehicles for retail sale [3]. The Collector of Customs rejected the refund claim. This ruling was affirmed by the respondent Acting Commissioner of Customs and subsequently by the Court of Tax Appeals [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the imported pump parts used by lessees of gasoline stations are exempt from the special import tax under Section 6 of R.A. 1394.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the pump parts are not exempt. Section 6 of R.A. 1394 expressly limits the tax exemption to equipment and spare parts "for the use of industries" [2].

The Court found that the parts were actually used by gasoline dealers in the retail sale of gasoline, not in the petitioner's specific *industry* of processing gasoline or manufacturing lubricating oil [3]. The Court rejected Esso's argument that marketing is merely incidental to its industrial operations [4]. Citing the principle that exemptions in tax statutes are never presumed and must be construed *strictissimi juris* against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority, the Court refused to expand the coverage of the law to include equipment for retail use [4, 5].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED [6].
