I. CAPTION
RAFAEL M. ABAYA v. ANTONIO J. VILLEGAS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25641, December 17, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Abaya passed the patrolman examination in 1962 and was appointed by respondent Mayor Villegas in 1964. His appointment was approved by appellant Civil Service Commissioner Subido, subject to the condition that there were no pending administrative cases or adverse decisions against him [1]. In 1965, Commissioner Subido cancelled Abaya’s eligibility and directed his termination, alleging Abaya gave a false "No" answer to a question regarding pending criminal accusations in his application, when in fact he had cases pending at the time [2, 3]. Despite the City Fiscal's opinion that a hearing was required, the Mayor terminated Abaya without a formal investigation upon the Commissioner's insistence [4-6]. Abaya filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus. The trial court ordered his reinstatement. The Commissioner appealed, arguing that a formal investigation was unnecessary because Abaya admitted the false answer [6-8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioner was denied due process when he was dismissed without a formal investigation.
2. W/N the petition should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that Abaya was denied due process. Section 32 of the Civil Service Law (R.A. 2260) and the Constitution provide that no officer in the civil service shall be removed except for cause and after due process, which includes the right to a formal investigation [7]. The Civil Service Rules invalidate eligibility only when an applicant *intentionally* makes a false statement [9, 10]. A false answer does not automatically imply intent, as good faith is presumed [10]. Without a hearing to prove the falsehood was intentional, the cancellation of eligibility and subsequent dismissal were illegal [8, 10].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that exhaustion of administrative remedies is not necessary in this case. Exceptions to the rule apply when: (1) the administrative remedy is not expeditious and adequate; (2) the question is purely legal; (3) the controverted act is patently illegal; and (4) there is a denial of due process [11, 12]. All these circumstances were present, justifying Abaya's immediate resort to the courts [12].

Judgment affirmed [13].
