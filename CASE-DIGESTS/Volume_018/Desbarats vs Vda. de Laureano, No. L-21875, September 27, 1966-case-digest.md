**I. CAPTION**
MARY BURKE DESBARATS, ET AL. v. JOSEFINA SEGARRA VDA. DE LAUREANO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21875, September 27, 1966, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiffs-appellees (Desbarats, et al.) leased a parcel of land in Manila to defendant-appellant Laureano in 1949 [1]. Due to unpaid rentals, plaintiffs demanded payment and vacation of the premises via a letter dated March 11, 1955 [2]. Following this, plaintiffs filed multiple suits: an action for rescission in the Court of First Instance (CFI) which was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, and two unlawful detainer cases in the Municipal Court, the second of which was dismissed in October 1957 because it was filed more than one year after the March 1955 demand [3, 4].

On December 27, 1957, plaintiffs sent another letter reminding Laureano to surrender the property [4, 5]. On January 28, 1958, plaintiffs filed the present action for recovery of possession (*accion publiciana*) in the CFI [4]. Laureano challenged the CFI's jurisdiction, arguing that the one-year period for unlawful detainer should be counted from the December 27, 1957 letter, making the case cognizable by the Municipal Court [6]. The CFI ruled it had jurisdiction, holding that the one-year period began from the first demand in March 1955 [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction over the complaint filed on January 28, 1958.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's jurisdiction. The Court held that the one-year period for filing an ejectment suit in the inferior court is computed from the **first demand** to vacate, which was made on March 11, 1955 [7]. The subsequent letter of December 27, 1957, was merely a reiteration or reminder of the original demand and did not constitute a new demand that would reset the period [5].

The Court distinguished this from cases where the lessor waives the right to eject by tolerating the lessee's possession after the initial demand. Here, there was no waiver or tolerance; the plaintiffs persistently filed actions to enforce their rights [5]. Since the lessee's possession became unlawful from the first demand in 1955, and the present action was filed in 1958 (more than one year later), the suit is an *accion publiciana* for the recovery of possession, which properly falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance [8]. Citing *Zobel v. Abreu* and *Cruz v. Atencio*, the Court ruled that where there is no tolerance of the unlawful possession, the time is reckoned from the original demand [7, 9].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed [8].
