I. CAPTION
A. D. SANTOS, INC., doing business under the name and style of "CITY CAB" v. DABOCOL, G.R. No. L-19051, November 23, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Zosimo Dabocol filed a claim for workmen's compensation against petitioner A. D. Santos, Inc. (City Cab) [1]. The Regional Administrator awarded compensation to Dabocol [2]. Petitioner moved to set aside the award, claiming it was denied its "day in court" to cross-examine witnesses and present evidence proving that no employer-employee relationship existed [2]. The Regional Administrator denied the motion, noting that during the scheduled conferences where petitioner’s counsel was present, the counsel presented a release form regarding insurance payments and requested a computation of benefits, but did not press the defense that Dabocol was not an employee or present evidence to disprove the claim [3, 4]. The Workmen's Compensation Commission affirmed the decision. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner was denied due process for allegedly not being given the opportunity to present evidence regarding the non-existence of an employer-employee relationship.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner was afforded reasonable opportunity to present evidence and prove its claim [5]. The record showed that petitioner appeared by counsel in the conference called by the Regional Office but failed to press its defense or present evidence to disprove the respondent's claim [5]. The Court emphasized that to expedite the disposition of compensation cases, the Workmen's Compensation Commission is not bound by technical or formal rules of procedure, pursuant to Section 2, Rule 7 of its Rules [5]. The Court found the petitioner's claim frivolous and intended merely for delay [5].

The decision appealed from is affirmed *in toto*, with double costs against petitioner [6].
