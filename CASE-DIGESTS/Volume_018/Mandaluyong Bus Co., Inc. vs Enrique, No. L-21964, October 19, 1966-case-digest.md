I. CAPTION
MANDALUYONG BUS CO., INC., ET AL. v. LUIS ENRIQUE, G.R. No. L-21964, October 19, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Luis Enrique applied with the Public Service Commission (PSC) for a Certificate of Public Convenience to operate eight PUJ jeepneys on a six-kilometer line from Pasig to Mandaluyong. Petitioners, existing operators on the route, opposed the application.

Evidence showed that prior to filing, Enrique was already operating four jeepneys without authority. This "colorum" operation arose due to "stern necessity" following the collapse of the Rosario bridge and the closure of another bridge in Pasig, which stranded commuters and required about 30 unauthorized jeepneys to fill the gap. The Pasig Municipal Council supported legitimizing these operations. Petitioners argued Enrique should be disqualified for the unauthorized operation and that, as prior operators, they should have preference to increase equipment ("old operator rule"). The PSC granted Enrique's application.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the applicant should be disqualified due to his prior unauthorized ("colorum") operation.
2. W/N the petitioners are entitled to preference under the "old operator rule."

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** While unauthorized operations are generally not countenanced, the Court ruled that "stern necessity" and good faith removed this case from the rigid application of the rule. The bridge collapse created an emergency where commuters were stranded, making their interests paramount. Enrique operated in response to this pressing need and promptly filed his application when the local council intervened [1-3].

2. **NO.** The petitioners were not entitled to preference because they failed to apply for an increase in equipment when the public necessity arose. The existence of 30 unauthorized jeepneys on the line was clear proof that the services of authorized operators were insufficient [4-6]. Additionally, petitioners operated on long-distance lines and their buses were already full when passing the short route applied for by the respondent [6].

The decision of the Public Service Commission is **AFFIRMED**.
