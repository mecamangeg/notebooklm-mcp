I. CAPTION
AIR FRANCE v. RAFAEL CARRASCOSO and the HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-21438, September 28, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Rafael Carrascoso, a civil engineer and member of a group of Filipino pilgrims, bought and was issued a "first class" round trip airplane ticket from Manila to Rome by Air France [1]. During the stopover in Bangkok, the Air France Manager forced Carrascoso to vacate his first class seat because a "white man" allegedly had a "better right" to it [1]. Carrascoso refused, stating he would only vacate over his dead body, but a commotion ensued and he reluctantly gave up his seat after being pacified by other passengers [2]. The purser noted in the logbook that the passenger was forced to transfer against his will [3]. Carrascoso filed a suit for damages. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Carrascoso, awarding moral and exemplary damages, among others [4]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, slightly modifying only the refund amount [5]. Air France petitioned for review, arguing the ticket was subject to confirmation and that there was no specific averment of bad faith to justify moral damages [6], [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Carrascoso was entitled to the first class seat despite Air France's claim that the ticket was subject to confirmation.
2. W/N Air France is liable for moral damages.
3. W/N Air France is liable for exemplary damages.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A written document speaks a uniform language, and the spoken word is notoriously unreliable [8]. The Court held that the issuance of a first class ticket confirms the engagement; oral evidence claiming it was subject to confirmation cannot prevail over the written evidence [9]. To allow an airline to deny the validity of tickets based on alleged verbal agreements would place passengers at the mercy of the airline's employees [10].

2. **YES.** Although the complaint did not explicitly use the words "bad faith," the inference was clear from the facts alleged (wrongful expulsion), and evidence of the Manager's arbitrariness (ousting Carrascoso for a "white man") was admitted without objection, curing any deficiency [11], [12]. The Manager's act of forcibly ejecting a passenger who was already seated to accommodate another without a proven better right constitutes bad faith [13]. Furthermore, a contract of air carriage generates a relation attended with a public duty [14]. The wrongful expulsion was a violation of this public duty (quasi-delict), justifying moral damages under Article 21 in relation to Article 2219 of the Civil Code [15], [16].

3. **YES.** Under Article 2232 of the Civil Code, the court may grant exemplary damages in contracts and quasi-contracts if the defendant acted in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent manner [17]. The manner of ejectment of Carrascoso fits this legal precept [17].

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED** [18].
