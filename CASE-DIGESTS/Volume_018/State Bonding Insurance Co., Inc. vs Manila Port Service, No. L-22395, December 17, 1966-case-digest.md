I. CAPTION
STATE BONDING INSURANCE COMPANY, INC. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22395, December 17, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
State Bonding Insurance Company (plaintiff) insured various shipments of imported goods consigned to seven different owners. Upon arrival in Manila, the goods were discharged into the custody of Manila Port Service (defendant), the arrastre operator. The consignees filed "provisional claims" for loss and damage within 15 days from the discharge of the last package, as required by Section 15 of the Arrastre Management Contract. These provisional claims were general notices and did not specify the value or extent of the damage. Detailed formal claims were submitted only after the 15-day period expired.

State Bonding paid the consignees for the lost/damaged goods, was subrogated to their rights, and filed suit against Manila Port Service for reimbursement. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of State Bonding, finding the provisional notices sufficient. Manila Port Service appealed directly to the Supreme Court, arguing that the provisional claims were invalid under Section 15 because they were vague and lacked statements of value [1-6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the filing of "provisional claims" within the 15-day period substantially complies with Section 15 of the Arrastre Management Contract despite lacking a statement of value or extent of damage.
2. W/N the appellants can question the trial court's findings on damages and attorney's fees in a direct appeal to the Supreme Court.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the provisional claims substantially complied with Section 15 of the Arrastre Management Contract. The underlying reason for the 15-day claim requirement is to provide the arrastre contractor a reasonable opportunity to check the validity of the claim while facts are still fresh in the minds of the persons involved and documents are available (*Consunji v. Manila Port Service*). Although the provisional claims did not state the precise amount or include supporting documents, they contained descriptions of the importations sufficient to allow the Manila Port Service to conduct a reasonable verification. The Court noted that a provisional claim filed *after* the discharge of goods and within the 15-day period is sufficient compliance, as the preparation of a formal claim with precise indemnity amounts requires time and should be done without haste (*Yu Kimteng Construction Corp. v. Manila Railroad Company*; *State Bonding & Insurance Co. v. Manila Port Service, et al., G.R. No. L-21833*) [7, 8].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that when a party directly appeals to the Supreme Court, intimating that they will raise only purely legal questions, they are deemed to have waived or are precluded from questioning the findings of fact made by the trial court (*Millar v. Nadres*). Consequently, the Court is bound by the trial court's factual findings regarding the negligence of the defendants and the award of actual damages and attorney's fees [9, 10].

The judgment of the Court of First Instance is AFFIRMED [10].
