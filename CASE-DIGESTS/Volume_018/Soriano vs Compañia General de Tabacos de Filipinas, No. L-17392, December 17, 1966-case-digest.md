I. CAPTION
**JOSE SORIANO v. COMPAÑIA GENERAL DE TABACOS DE FILIPINAS**, G.R. No. L-17392, December 17, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Jose Soriano (Planter) obtained crop loans from Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas (Tabacalera) for the 1940-1941 crop year, secured by a mortgage on his sugar crops. The agreement authorized Tabacalera to export and sell Soriano's sugar at its discretion if he had outstanding debts [1, 2]. In August 1941, Tabacalera exported 16,000 piculs of Soriano's sugar but credited him only in December 1942 [3, 4]. Regarding another 35,528.01 piculs, Tabacalera informed Soriano after the war that this sugar was burned during the Japanese Occupation, leading Soriano to claim and receive P130,000 from the War Damage Commission [5, 6]. Soriano later discovered that Tabacalera had actually exported and sold this sugar before the war [7]. Tabacalera admitted the shipment but claimed it was for its "own account" or that, per company practice, it required specific instructions from the planter to sell, which Soriano allegedly did not provide [8, 9]. The trial court ruled in favor of Soriano for the proceeds but denied moral damages. Both parties appealed [10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Tabacalera is liable for the proceeds of the 35,528.01 piculs of sugar it exported.
2. W/N parol evidence of company practice is admissible to alter the terms of the written crop loan agreement.
3. W/N the War Damage compensation received by Soriano should be deducted from Tabacalera's liability.
4. W/N Soriano is entitled to moral damages and attorney's fees.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Tabacalera is liable. The written crop loan agreement expressly authorized Tabacalera to sell the sugar at its discretion without the planter's consent when the planter had an outstanding debt, which Soriano did [2, 11]. Since Tabacalera admitted shipping the sugar, it must credit Soriano with the proceeds. The claim that it shipped the sugar for its "own account" is untenable as it concealed the fact from Soriano [11, 12].

2. **NO.** Parol evidence is inadmissible. Under Rule 123, Section 22 of the Rules of Court, when an agreement is reduced to writing, it is deemed to contain all terms agreed upon [13]. Tabacalera cannot adduce evidence of an alleged "practice" of requiring prior permission to sell, as this would alter the clear terms of the written contract authorizing sale at its discretion [13].

3. **NO.** The War Damage compensation cannot be deducted because the War Damage Commission is not a party to the case [14]. However, since the sugar was not actually lost but sold by Tabacalera, the compensation does not belong to Soriano. The proper remedy is for Soriano to judicially consign the P130,000 sum to permit Tabacalera and the War Damage Commission to interplead and determine their rights [14].

4. **NO** (Moral Damages) / **YES** (Attorney's Fees). Soriano is not entitled to moral damages because the fraud (concealment of shipment) occurred prior to the effectivity of the New Civil Code, and the Old Civil Code did not expressly recognize moral damages [15]. However, Soriano is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees because Tabacalera acted in evident bad faith by refusing to satisfy a valid claim and concealing the shipment [16]. Soriano is also entitled to 6% interest on the proceeds from the date of shipment due to Tabacalera's delay [17, 18].

**Disposition**: Decision modified. Tabacalera is ordered to pay the proceeds of the sugar with interest and attorney's fees; Soriano is ordered to consign the War Damage compensation upon satisfaction of judgment [19].
