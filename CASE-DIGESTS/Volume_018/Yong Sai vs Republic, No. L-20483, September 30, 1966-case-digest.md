I. CAPTION
**YONG SAI v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-20483, September 30, 1966, 18 SCRA 264, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Yong Sai filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Tacloban City, which was granted on March 31, 1960 [1, 2]. On May 21, 1962, after the two-year probationary period, he filed a petition to take his oath [2]. The CFI granted this on the same day; Yong Sai immediately took his oath and was issued a certificate of naturalization [2].

The Solicitor General appealed the order allowing the oath-taking within the reglementary period [3]. Yong Sai moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing the decision was already final and he had already taken his oath [4]. On the merits, the evidence showed Yong Sai’s average annual income was only P3,000.00 while supporting a wife and three children [5]. Additionally, he failed to state in his petition his former residences in Dumaguete and Sogod, and his other names, "Alexander Lim Uy" or "Alejandro Lim Uy" [6-8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Government can still appeal after the petitioner has taken his oath of allegiance.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
3. W/N the failure to state former residences and aliases in the petition is fatal.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A decision in naturalization cases does not become final until the expiration of the period to appeal from the order authorizing the taking of the oath of allegiance under Section 1 of Republic Act No. 530 [9]. This rule applies even if the applicant has already taken the oath [9]. The Court held that the "precipitate administration of the oath" before the appeal period expires is "highly irregular" and constitutes an attempt to render the Government's appeal nugatory (*So v. Republic*) [10, 11]. Furthermore, an appeal from the order authorizing the oath subjects the *entire* naturalization proceedings to scrutiny by the Supreme Court [12].

2. **NO.** An applicant earning an average annual salary of P3,000.00 with a wife and three children to support does not have a lucrative trade or occupation [5]. Qualification is reckoned as of the date of application [13]. Even if the Court considered his later alleged income of roughly P6,000.00, it is still insufficient, as *Tan v. Republic* held that P6,300.00 is not lucrative for an applicant with a wife and one child [5].

3. **YES.** The failure to state all former residences (Dumaguete and Sogod) is a fatal defect that warrants dismissal and affects the jurisdiction of the court to hear the case (*Go v. Republic*) [7, 14]. Similarly, the failure to disclose all names by which the applicant is known (e.g., Alexander Lim Uy) is sufficient ground to deny the petition (*Lim Uy v. Republic*) [8].

The decision of the lower court is **REVERSED**, the petition for naturalization is **DENIED**, the oath of allegiance is declared without force and effect, and the certificate of naturalization is ordered **CANCELLED** [15].
