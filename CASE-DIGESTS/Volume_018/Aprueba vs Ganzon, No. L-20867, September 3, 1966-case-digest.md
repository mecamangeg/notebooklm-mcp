I. CAPTION
SALVADOR APRUEBA and ASUNCION MODOC v. HON. RODOLFO GANZON, G.R. No. L-20867, September 3, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Aprueba and Modoc were owners and operators of a cafeteria in Stall 17-C of the Iloilo City market since 1950 [1]. On October 1, 1960, respondent City Mayor Ganzon ordered the stall closed for alleged violations of city ordinances [1]. Despite Aprueba paying back accounts, the Mayor refused to allow the reopening of the stall, alleging that Aprueba violated Ordinance No. 93 by allowing his co-petitioner Modoc, a non-lessee, to conduct business therein [2]. Petitioners filed a petition for *mandamus* with the Court of First Instance of Iloilo to compel the Mayor to permit them to operate, arguing it was his ministerial duty [1]. The trial court dismissed the petition, ruling that the remedy was improper as the occupancy was a privilege based on a contractual obligation, not an official duty enjoined by law [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N *mandamus* lies to compel the City Mayor to grant the privilege of operating a market stall.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the privilege of petitioners to obtain a renewal of the permit after the implied lease expired rested on the sound discretion of the respondent Mayor [4]. Under Section 10(m) of the City Charter, the Mayor has the power to grant and refuse municipal licenses and revoke them for violations of conditions or ordinances [5]. *Mandamus* will not issue to control or review the exercise of discretion by a public officer where the law imposes on him the right to exercise judgment (*Blanco vs. Board*) [4]. Furthermore, the privilege of operating a market stall is subject to the police power of the city and is revocable for reasons of public policy [6]. Finally, the occupancy was based on a contractual obligation (implied lease), and the universally accepted rule is that *mandamus* never lies to enforce the performance of contractual obligations; the proper remedy is an action for specific performance (*City of Manila vs. Posadas*; *Quiogue vs. Romualdez*) [6].

The order of dismissal is affirmed [7].
