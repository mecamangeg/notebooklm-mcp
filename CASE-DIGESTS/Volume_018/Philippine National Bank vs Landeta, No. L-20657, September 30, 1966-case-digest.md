**I. CAPTION**
**PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. BERNARDO P. LANDETA and COURT OF APPEALS**, G.R. No. L-20657, September 30, 1966, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Bernardo P. Landeta owned a parcel of agricultural land in Cagayan acquired as a homestead. He mortgaged it to the Philippine National Bank (PNB) to secure a P600.00 loan. Upon his failure to pay, PNB foreclosed the mortgage and acquired the property at the auction on July 22, 1952. Title was consolidated in PNB's name on June 17, 1954. Within the five-year redemption period, Landeta offered to repurchase the property. However, PNB sold its rights to Doroteo Yabes for P3,000.00 on January 6, 1955, and instructed Landeta to redeem the property from Yabes instead. Landeta filed a suit to enforce his right to repurchase under Section 119 of the Public Land Act. The trial court ordered Yabes to resell the land to Landeta for P3,414.03. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed this, annulling the sale to Yabes and ordering PNB to allow Landeta to repurchase for the amount of the principal obligation and accumulated interests only.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the homesteader (Landeta) is entitled to repurchase the property from the bank for the amount of the principal obligation and interest, rather than from the subsequent purchaser (Yabes) at a higher price.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision. The Court held that Landeta is entitled to repurchase the property from PNB, and the consideration should be only the amount corresponding to the principal obligation and accumulated interests up to the time of actual repurchase. The right to repurchase may be exercised irrespective of whether the bank had subsequently conveyed the property to a third party (*Villaflor v. Barreto*, 92 Phil. 297). The Court reasoned that a different ruling would allow banks to render nugatory the right of repurchase granted by the Public Land Act to homesteaders by conveying the property to third parties for amounts beyond the homesteader's capacity to pay.

**Decision affirmed.**
