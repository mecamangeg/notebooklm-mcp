I. CAPTION
MANUEL SUAREZ v. THE MUNICIPALITY OF NAUJAN, ORIENTAL MINDORO, and MANUEL MARCOS, the Mayor thereof; THE MUNICIPALITY OF POLA, same Province and PEDRO ASERON, the Mayor thereof, G.R. No. L-22282, November 21, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Manuel Suarez entered into a lease contract with the Municipality of Pola on October 14, 1961, for fishery privileges in Naujan Lake. The Mayor of Naujan interfered with Suarez’s operations, claiming Naujan had exclusive jurisdiction over the lake [1]. Suarez previously filed two special civil cases (No. R-1054 for prohibition and No. R-1077 for mandamus) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Oriental Mindoro against the Municipality of Naujan and its Mayor to enforce his rights [1, 2].

On April 24, 1963, the Mindoro CFI dismissed both cases after the Office of the President revoked an earlier decision and recognized Naujan's exclusive jurisdiction over the lake, ruling that Suarez’s action had "no further cause for its being" [3, 4]. Suarez did not appeal, and these dismissal orders became final and executory [4].

Subsequently, on May 29, 1963, Suarez filed a complaint for declaratory relief (Civil Case No. 54069) in the CFI of Manila against the same respondents, seeking to determine the legality of his lease and the extent of Pola’s municipal waters [5]. The Manila CFI dismissed the complaint on the ground of *res judicata* [6]. Suarez appealed, arguing the prior dismissal was based on a void administrative decision and that the reliefs sought were different [7-9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the complaint for declaratory relief is barred by *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that all requisites of *res judicata* were present: (a) the prior dismissal orders by the Mindoro court were final as no appeal was taken; (b) the Mindoro court had jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties; (c) the dismissal was an adjudication on the merits; and (d) there was identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action [10, 11].

The Court ruled that a dismissal predicated on a lack of cause of action is considered a judgment on the merits (*Planas v. Castelo*; *Florendo v. Vda. de Gonzales*) [10]. Regarding identity of parties, the Court held that absolute identity is not required, only substantial identity; the addition of the Municipality of Pola in the later case did not prevent the application of the doctrine (*Grimm v. Atok-Big Wedge Mining Co.*) [11]. Finally, regarding the cause of action, the Court emphasized that a party cannot escape *res judicata* by merely varying the form of action (from mandamus/prohibition to declaratory relief) when the same cause is being litigated (*Francisco v. Blas*) [9].

The orders appealed from are AFFIRMED [12].
