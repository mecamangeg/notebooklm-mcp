I. CAPTION
ABOITIZ SHIPPING CORPORATION v. VIVENCIA ANDO PEPITO, et al., G.R. No. L-21335, December 17, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Demetrio Pepito, a crew member of petitioner's vessel M/V P. Aboitiz, disappeared while the vessel was on a voyage between the night of November 30 and the early morning of December 1, 1961 [1]. On January 12, 1962, his wife, respondent Vivencia Ando Pepito, filed a claim for death benefits, stating her husband was "lost or reported missing" and believed dead [2, 3]. Petitioner Aboitiz Shipping Corporation only controverted the claim on February 16, 1962, well beyond the statutory period of 14 days from the accident or 10 days from knowledge thereof [3, 4].

On March 21, 1962, the Regional Administrator awarded death benefits to the respondents without a hearing, solely on the ground that the petitioner failed to timely controvert the claim [5]. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed the decision [5]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the award without a hearing violated due process and that the failure to controvert did not admit the fact of death [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the employer's failure to timely controvert the claim constitutes an admission of the actual fact of death.
2. W/N the award of compensation without a hearing violated the employer's right to due process.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Non-controversion in compensation cases, similar to pleadings in ordinary civil cases, constitutes an admission of facts, not conclusions of law [7]. The petitioner's failure to controvert the statement that Demetrio was "lost" or "reported missing" admits only that he is missing, but does not import an admission that he is actually dead [6, 7]. At the time the claim was filed (42 days after the incident), no legal presumption of death existed, and legally, death could not be taken as a fact [8].

2. **YES.** The award was made before the petitioner was given an opportunity to be heard on the debatable fact and circumstances of death, which violates the constitutional prescription of due process [6]. The Commission relied on an *ex parte* investigation report which is hearsay; under Section 6 of the Workmen's Compensation Law, such reports have no value as evidence unless the party in interest is afforded the opportunity to examine and rebut them [9, 10].

However, since more than four years had elapsed by the time of the Supreme Court decision, the case could now fall under Article 391 of the Civil Code regarding the presumption of death for a person missing for four years [11, 12]. Consequently, the decision and resolution are **SET ASIDE**, and the case is **REMANDED** to the Workmen's Compensation Commission for a rehearing to determine whether Demetrio Pepito is alive or presumed dead, and the circumstances of his death [13, 14].
