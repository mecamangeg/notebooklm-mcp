I. CAPTION
MARVEX COMMERCIAL CO., INC. v. PETRA HAWPIA & CO. and THE DIRECTOR OF PATENTS, G.R. No. L-19297, December 22, 1966, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Petra Hawpia & Co. filed a petition for the registration of the trademark "LIONPAS" used on medicated plaster, claiming continuous use in the Philippines since June 1958. Petitioner Marvex Commercial Co., Inc. opposed the application, alleging that the registration would violate its right to the trademark "SALONPAS," also used on medicated plaster and registered in its name since 1956, and that the two marks were confusingly similar [1].

The Director of Patents dismissed the opposition and gave due course to the petition, ruling that confusion or mistake among purchasers would not likely occur. Marvex appealed, questioning the applicant's ownership of the mark and the Director's finding on similarity [2]. Evidence presented by Petra Hawpia regarding ownership included unauthenticated and contradictory documents from Japanese entities "Osaka Boeki Kaisha, Ltd." and "Asunaro Pharmaceutical," while other exhibits described Petra Hawpia merely as a "sole distributor" or "importer" [3-5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N respondent Petra Hawpia & Co. is the owner of the trademark "LIONPAS" and entitled to register it.
2. W/N the trademark "LIONPAS" is confusingly similar to "SALONPAS."

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The right to register trademarks is based on ownership, and the applicant has the burden of proving such ownership. Petra Hawpia failed to prove it was the owner; the alleged assignment documents were legally insufficient, unacknowledged, and did not comply with Sections 31 and 37 of the Trade Mark Law (R.A. 166) [4, 6]. Furthermore, the record showed the respondent was merely an importer or exclusive distributor of the product. An applicant who is not the owner but merely an importer or distributor is not entitled to register the trademark in its name (*Operators, Inc. vs. Director of Patents*) [7].

2. **YES.** Although the suffix "PAS" is merely descriptive of a plaster with curative powers and is open for appropriation, the trademarks "LIONPAS" and "SALONPAS" are confusingly similar in sound [8]. When pronounced, the two words sound very much alike despite the difference in spelling. Similarity of sound is a sufficient ground for holding two marks confusingly similar, especially where goods are advertised over the radio (*Co Tiong Sa vs. Director of Patents*; *Sapolin Co. vs. Balmaceda*) [9, 10].

ACCORDINGLY, the decision of the respondent Director of Patents is set aside, and the petition below of the respondent Petra Hawpia & Co. is hereby dismissed [11].
