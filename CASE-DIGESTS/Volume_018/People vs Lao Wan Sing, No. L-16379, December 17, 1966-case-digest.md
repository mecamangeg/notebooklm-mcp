I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LAO WAN SING alias Co TIOK alias WASING, G.R. No. L-16379, December 17, 1966, 18 SCRA 1076, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On June 17, 1956, a fire broke out at Juana's Store in the business section of Kalibo, Aklan [1]. As this fire was dying down and the danger of spreading had passed, a second fire erupted in the kitchen of the New Plaza Bazar, an establishment owned by the appellant, Lao Wan Sing [2, 3]. Prosecution witnesses Jose Narce, Guillermo Vidal, and Coronacion Peñaflor testified that they saw the appellant pouring kerosene and setting fire to his kitchen, or observed him inside the kitchen moments before the fire started [4-6]. The appellant denied the charges, claiming alibi and arguing that the fire spread from the initial conflagration [7, 8]. The Court of First Instance of Aklan convicted him of arson with the aggravating circumstance of "taking advantage of the confusion occasioned by another fire," sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* and ordering indemnification [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appellant is guilty of arson based on the credibility of the prosecution witnesses. [10]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, adhering to the rule that appellate courts will not generally disturb the trial court's findings on witness credibility unless facts of substance were overlooked [10]. The Court found the prosecution witnesses credible, ruling that their delay in reporting the crime was a natural reaction to fear and the stress of the event [11]. Physical evidence refuting the defense theory showed that the wind was blowing away from the appellant's store and that his kitchen was roofed with galvanized iron, making it unlikely to have ignited from the first fire [3]. Furthermore, the Court established a motive of pecuniary gain, noting the appellant likely sought to recover losses from looting and confusion not covered by his insurance policy [12]. The Court appreciated the aggravating circumstance under Article 14, paragraph 7 of the Revised Penal Code for taking advantage of the confusion occasioned by another fire [12].

Judgment affirmed [13].
