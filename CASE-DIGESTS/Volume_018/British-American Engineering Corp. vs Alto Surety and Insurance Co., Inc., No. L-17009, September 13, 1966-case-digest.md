I. CAPTION
BRITISH-AMERICAN ENGINEERING CORPORATION v. ALTO SURETY AND INSURANCE COMPANY, INCORPORATED, ANTONIO QUIRINO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17009, September 13, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In 1947, appellee British-American Engineering Corporation paid P250,000.00 to appellant Alto Surety through its Secretary-Treasurer, Aleli Quirino. The payments were evidenced by vouchers stating they were for the purchase of 2,500 shares of Alto’s capital stock [1]. However, the stock certificates corresponding to these shares were issued to the original subscribers and the Quirino spouses, not to British-American [2]. For nearly ten years, British-American made no demand for the certificates [3]. On April 1, 1957, British-American filed a complaint to compel Alto to issue the certificates. The trial court ruled in favor of British-American, ordering Alto to issue 2,500 shares to the appellee [4]. Alto appealed, arguing the judgment would create an anomalous situation of over-issued stock.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Alto Surety can be compelled to issue 2,500 shares of stock to British-American.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s decision. The Court held that the trial court's judgment would result in an "anomalous and illegal situation" where 5,000 shares (with a total par value of P500,000.00) would be outstanding despite only P250,000.00 having been actually paid to the corporation [5]. This is because the judgment ordered the issuance of new shares to British-American without providing for the nullification or cancellation of the 2,500 shares already issued to the Quirinos and original subscribers [5].

Furthermore, the Court ruled that since the certificates were already issued to other parties—an act impliedly ratified by British-American’s failure to object for ten years—the corporation had no further obligation to perform [6]. The proper remedy for British-American was to file an action against the specific holders of the certificates (the Quirinos) to recover the shares [6]. However, such relief could not be granted in this case because the Quirinos were impleaded only in their official capacities as corporate officers, not in their personal capacities as shareholders [6].

**Judgment reversed.**
