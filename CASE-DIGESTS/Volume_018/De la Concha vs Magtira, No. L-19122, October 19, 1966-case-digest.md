I. CAPTION
PEDRO DE LA CONCHA, et al. v. IRINEO MAGTIRA, G.R. No. L-19122, October 19, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
The subject property is Lot No. 2716 of the San Miguel (Bulacan) cadastre. In a 1929 decision that became final, the court declared the land as the private property of the predecessors-in-interest of the plaintiffs, Pedro de la Concha, et al. Despite this, defendant Irineo Magtira obtained Free Patent No. V-2309 and Original Certificate of Title No. P-89 covering the same lot on October 20, 1952.

On January 12, 1960, plaintiffs filed an action to declare the free patent null and void, cancel the title, and reconvey the land. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring the patent and title null and void because the land was private property. The defendant appealed, arguing that under the Public Land Act and the Land Registration Act, his title became indefeasible and irrevocable one year after its issuance.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the free patent and certificate of title issued to the defendant are valid and indefeasible despite the land being private property.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the trial court's decision. Private ownership of land is not affected by the issuance of a free patent over the same land because the Public Land Law applies only to lands of the public domain. The Director of Lands has no authority to grant a free patent for land that has ceased to be public land and has passed to private ownership (citing *Garcia vs. Director of Lands*).

Consequently, a certificate of title issued pursuant to a homestead or free patent partakes of the nature of a certificate issued in a judicial proceeding only if the land covered by it is really a part of the disposable land of the public domain. Since the land in question was already private property, the patent and title issued to the defendant are nullities.

The decision of the lower court is affirmed.
