I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MANUEL DADIS, G.R. No. L-21270, November 22, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On May 10, 1954, appellant Manuel Dadis, a member of the police force of Lagonoy, Camarines Sur, was ordered by his Chief of Police to disarm Alfredo Estrelles, who had reportedly threatened another person. Dadis proceeded to Barrio Baliwag and encountered Estrelles. While Dadis claimed he fired because Estrelles advanced and reached for a gun, prosecution witness Santiago Zamudio testified that Estrelles was running away when Dadis shot him. Estrelles suffered two gunshot wounds—one on the left side and one on the back—and died from hemorrhage. The Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur convicted Dadis of Murder, finding the killing qualified by treachery and evident premeditation, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Dadis appealed the conviction [1-5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the killing was qualified by treachery and evident premeditation to constitute Murder.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court modified the conviction from Murder to Homicide.

The Court held that **evident premeditation** was absent because Dadis went to the scene in obedience to an order from his superior to disarm the deceased, not with a pre-conceived plan to kill him. There was no proof of meditation or reflection on a criminal intent [6, 7].

Regarding **treachery**, the Court ruled that although the deceased was running away and had no means of defending himself when shot, Dadis did not purposely take advantage of this circumstance to kill him without risk to himself. The Court noted that Dadis was "scared" and "trigger happy," acting on the belief that Estrelles was armed (which the record indicated was likely true, though the gun was not drawn). Absent the conscious adoption of a treacherous mode of attack, the crime is only Homicide [6-8].

Judgment is modified; appellant is convicted of Homicide and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 10 years of *prision mayor* to 17 years of *reclusion temporal*, and ordered to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P6,000 [8].
