I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HONORATO GENILLA, G.R. No. L-23681, September 3, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of August 24, 1953, in Kapatagan, Lanao, Faustino Amate was attacked by two men with bolos while answering a call of nature outside his house. His wife, Cleofe, and a housemate, Alfredo Homok, heard his shouts and saw the assailants, whom they identified as Honorato Genilla and Leopoldo Arellano. Faustino died from the wounds. The motive was traced to a land conflict between Genilla and Necitas Agawin, the victim’s landlord. The Court of First Instance of Lanao del Norte convicted Genilla and Arellano of murder, sentencing them to an indeterminate penalty. Genilla appealed. While the appeal was pending, Genilla filed a motion for new trial based on two affidavits purportedly executed by the widow, Cleofe, retracting her testimony and clearing the appellant.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the motion for new trial based on the widow's retraction should be granted.
2. W/N the penalty imposed by the lower court was correct.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the retracting affidavits must be considered with caution. The affidavits were suspicious: one had a signature suggesting illiteracy while the other was thumbmarked, with no explanation for the inconsistency or the three-year delay in filing the first affidavit. Furthermore, the appellant's conviction was not based exclusively on the widow's testimony but was corroborated by Alfredo Homok, the victim's ante-mortem declaration, and the co-accused's admission. Retractions are not grounds for a new trial when other evidence independently sustains the conviction.

2. **NO.** The lower court erred in applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law. Since no modifying circumstances were present other than the qualifying circumstance of treachery, the penalty for murder should be imposed in its medium period, which is *reclusion perpetua*. Under Section 2 of Act No. 4103, the Indeterminate Sentence Law does not apply to persons convicted of offenses punished with death or life imprisonment.

The judgment is **MODIFIED** as to the penalty, which is raised to *reclusion perpetua*, and **AFFIRMED** in all other respects.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
