I. CAPTION
JACINTO DECENA v. THE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, FAUSTINO BANDALES, AQUILINO SOGONI and AGAPITO BANDALES, G.R. No. L-20988, September 27, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Timoteo and Agatona Bandales were the owners of three parcels of land in Quezon, which they entrusted to petitioner Jacinto Decena for cultivation as a tenant in 1927 [1]. The spouses subsequently died without descendants [2]. The private respondents (nephews of the deceased) filed a civil case against alleged donees to claim the property [2]. The Court of Appeals eventually declared the respondents as the lawful heirs and exclusive owners of the lots [2].

Pursuant to a writ of execution from that decision, Decena was dispossessed of his landholdings in November 1961 [3]. He filed a petition for reinstatement and damages with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) [3]. The CAR dismissed the case, ruling that the previous landholders who established the tenancy were not the true owners [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the tenancy relationship was extinguished by the death of the original landholders or the transfer of ownership to their heirs.
2. W/N the petitioner's failure to file a third-party claim in the execution proceedings barred him from filing a separate action for reinstatement.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The tenancy relationship is not terminated by the death of the landholder. The Court cited *Ferreria v. Gonzales*, holding that the death of the landholder alone does not extinguish the tenancy relationship [1, 5]. Furthermore, under Section 9 of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended by Republic Act No. 2263, in the case of the landholder's death, his heir or heirs shall assume his rights and obligations [1, 6]. Since the Court of Appeals recognized the deceased spouses as the previous owners, Decena was a legitimate tenant, and the respondents, as heirs, assumed the statutory obligations to respect his tenure [7, 8].

2. **NO.** The remedy of a third-party claim under Section 15, Rule 39 of the Old Rules of Court is not exclusive [9]. The provision expressly states that nothing therein shall prevent a third person "from vindicating his claim to the property by any proper action" [8, 9]. Thus, Decena was entitled to file a separate suit for reinstatement.

The Order appealed from is reversed, and the petitioner is ordered reinstated as tenant. No damages were awarded as the ejection was pursuant to a court order [10].
