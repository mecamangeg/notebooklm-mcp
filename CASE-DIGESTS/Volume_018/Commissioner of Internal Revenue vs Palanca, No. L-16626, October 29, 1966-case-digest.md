I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. CARLOS PALANCA, JR., G.R. No. L-16626, October 29, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Sometime in 1950, Don Carlos Palanca, Sr. donated shares of stock to respondent Carlos Palanca, Jr. The respondent paid gift taxes, surcharges, and interest on the donation [1]. Later, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) considered the donation a "transfer in contemplation of death" and assessed estate and inheritance taxes against respondent [2]. The gift tax payments were applied to this new assessment, but respondent still paid P60,581.80 as interest for delinquency on the estate and inheritance taxes [3]. On August 12, 1958, respondent filed an amended 1955 income tax return, claiming the P60,581.80 interest payment as a deduction and requesting a refund of P20,624.01 [4]. Without waiting for the BIR's decision, respondent filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) on August 13, 1958 [5]. The CTA ordered the refund. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) appealed, arguing that a tax is not a debt, so interest paid on it is not deductible under Section 30(b)(1) of the Tax Code, and that the claim had prescribed [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N interest paid on delinquent estate and inheritance taxes is deductible from gross income as interest on indebtedness.
2. W/N the claim for refund has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While "taxes" and "debts" are distinct legal concepts, the distinction is inconsequential regarding the deductibility of interest under Section 30(b)(1) of the Tax Code [7, 8]. The Court affirmed the doctrine in *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Prieto*, holding that interest on taxes should be considered as interest on indebtedness within the meaning of the Tax Code [8, 9]. The term "indebtedness" includes unconditional and legally enforceable obligations for the payment of money, a definition that encompasses taxes [10]. Thus, interest paid on delinquent estate and inheritance taxes is deductible [8].

2. **NO.** The claim was timely. Regarding the 30-day period under Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125, the period begins upon receipt of the *final denial* by the BIR; here, the respondent filed with the CTA *before* the BIR even denied the claim, so the period had not yet commenced [11]. regarding the two-year prescriptive period under Section 306 of the Tax Code, the period is computed from the date of the *last installment* of the tax paid [12]. Respondent paid the last installment of his 1955 income tax on August 14, 1956, and filed his claim in court on August 13, 1958, which is within the two-year period [12].

Decision affirmed [13].
