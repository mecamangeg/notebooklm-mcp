I. CAPTION
FIRESTONE TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES v. INES CHAVES & CO., LTD., ET AL., G.R. No. L-17106, October 19, 1966, 18 SCRA 356, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Appellee Firestone filed a collection suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against appellants Ines Chaves & Co., Ltd. for P6,241.75, representing the price of tires and accessories sold to them [1]. Firestone also claimed interest and 25% attorney's fees based on stipulations printed on the invoices [1, 2].

The CFI rendered judgment for Firestone on the principal amount but denied the claim for fees based on the invoice stipulation, finding no proof the appellants agreed to it [2]. However, the trial court still ordered the payment of legal interest and 25% attorney's fees on the ground that the appellants were guilty of bad faith [2, 3]. Specifically, appellants issued a check for P1,437.50 as partial payment, which was dishonored for insufficiency of funds [3]. Appellants appealed, arguing they were not in bad faith because they allegedly informed Firestone the check was not yet funded [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the award of attorney's fees based on the defendant's bad faith was proper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the award of attorney's fees.

As a general rule, attorney's fees cannot be recovered as damages to avoid placing a premium on the right to litigate [5]. However, **Article 2208(5) of the Civil Code** provides an exception where the defendant acted in "gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy plaintiff's plainly valid, just and demandable claims" [6].

The Court found the appellants' conduct wanting in good faith. The record showed no evidence that appellants informed Firestone of the lack of funds when the check was issued [7]. By issuing the check, appellants effectively represented that there were funds in the bank for its payment [7]. The issuance of a check subsequently dishonored for insufficiency of funds constituted bad faith, warranting the award of attorney's fees under Article 2208 [7, 8].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [9].
