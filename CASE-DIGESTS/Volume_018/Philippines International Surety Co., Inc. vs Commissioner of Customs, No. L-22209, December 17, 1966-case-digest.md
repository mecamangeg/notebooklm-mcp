I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINES INTERNATIONAL SURETY CO., INC. v. COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-22209, December 17, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
From June to August 1955, four shipments consigned to Pablo Gonzales arrived without the release certificates required by Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 [1]. The Acting Collector of Customs initiated seizure proceedings but released the goods to Gonzales upon the filing of surety bonds by petitioner Philippines International Surety Co., Inc. [1]. On April 4, 1960, the Collector ordered the forfeiture of the goods and directed Gonzales and the petitioner to pay P53,434.08 [1, 2]. Gonzales appealed to the Respondent Commissioner of Customs, who affirmed the Collector's decision [2]. The petitioner Surety did not appeal the Collector's decision to the Commissioner [3]. Instead, the Surety appealed the Commissioner's decision to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), arguing that the Collector failed to furnish Gonzales with a copy of the decision and that the CB Circulars were void [3]. The CTA dismissed the appeal, ruling that the Surety lacked legal capacity to appeal [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Surety has the right to appeal the decision of the Commissioner of Customs to the Court of Tax Appeals.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals.

First, the petitioner Surety did not appeal the decision of the Collector of Customs to the Commissioner of Customs; thus, the decision became final and executory as against the Surety [4]. While the importer (Gonzales) appealed, he failed to sustain his appeal, and the Surety cannot invoke the importer's rights to justify its own appeal to the CTA when it allowed the lower decision to become final [4]. The Court held that lack of notice of a decision affects only its *finality*, not its *validity*, and the importer waived this defect by filing an appeal [3, 4].

Second, under the terms of the bond, the Surety guaranteed only the payment of the appraised value of the goods "in the event that it should be finally decided that the merchandise... should be forfeited" [5]. It did not guarantee the legality of the importation. Therefore, the Surety is precluded from questioning the legality of the seizure or the Central Bank Circulars, much like a bail bondsman cannot intervene in a criminal trial to prove the innocence of the accused [5]. The Surety may only object if asked to pay an amount exceeding the bond or without a decree of forfeiture [5].

Judgment affirmed [6].
