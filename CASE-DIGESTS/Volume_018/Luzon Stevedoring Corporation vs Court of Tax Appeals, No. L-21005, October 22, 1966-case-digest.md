I. CAPTION
LUZON STEVEDORING CORPORATION v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS and COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-21005, October 22, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Luzon Stevedoring Corporation, engaged in the lighterage business, used tugboats and barges to transport petroleum products for Caltex. These vessels moored at the privately-owned Caltex pier in Bauan, Batangas, which is a national port [1, 2]. The government collected P9,506.92 in berthing and mooring charges from the petitioner for the period covering August 20, 1957, to July 20, 1959 [1]. Petitioner argued that because the pier was private property, the government had no right to impose these charges [3]. Petitioner alleged it made a verbal protest to the local customs collector in 1957, but a formal written protest was only filed on August 4, 1959 [2, 4]. The Collector of Customs dismissed the protest, a decision affirmed by the Commissioner of Customs and the Court of Tax Appeals [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the government may collect berthing charges on vessels moored at a privately-owned pier.
2. W/N a verbal protest constitutes a valid condition precedent for the refund of berthing charges.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the government's right to collect berthing charges is not conditioned on the pier being publicly owned. Section 2901 of the Tariff and Customs Code assesses charges for mooring at a "pier" without distinguishing between private or public ownership [3]. Under the principle of statutory construction, where the law does not exact the nature of ownership as a condition, that condition should not be read into the law [5]. Furthermore, vessels are liable for charges by simply coming within any channel or port under Philippine jurisdiction, as they benefit from the government's maintenance of port facilities necessary for navigation [6].

2. **NO.** Section 2308 of the Tariff and Customs Code expressly requires a "written protest" to be filed within 30 days after payment as a condition precedent for a refund [7, 8]. The Court held that a verbal protest is insufficient because it breeds uncertainty due to the frailty of human memory [4, 7]. Additionally, the government cannot be estopped by the mistakes of its agents who may have entertained the verbal protest [4]. Consequently, payments made prior to the written protest on August 4, 1959, could not be refunded.

The judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [9].
