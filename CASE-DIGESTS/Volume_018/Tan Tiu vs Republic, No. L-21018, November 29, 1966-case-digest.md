I. CAPTION
IN RE: PETITION FOR NATURALIZATION OF ALEJANDRO TAN TIU. ALEJANDRO TAN TIU v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21018, November 29, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alejandro Tan Tiu filed a petition for naturalization. He was single and employed as a storekeeper for his brother, earning a total income of P230.00 per month (P150.00 salary plus P80.00 for free board and lodging). Born in Dapa, Surigao in 1929, he resided there until 1948 (almost 20 years) before moving to his present residence in Numancia, Surigao. However, in his petition, he only listed Numancia as his residence and failed to state Dapa as a former place of residence. The Court of First Instance of Surigao del Norte granted the petition. The Republic appealed, arguing that the omission of the former residence was fatal and that the petitioner lacked a lucrative trade.

III. ISSUES
1. W/N the failure to state a former place of residence in the petition is a fatal defect.
2. W/N the petitioner’s income satisfies the lucrative trade requirement.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The failure to state all places of residence is fatal. Section 7 of the Naturalization Law requires the petition to set forth not only the present address but also "former places of residence." The Court held that mentioning Dapa as the "place of birth" in the petition did not cure the defect because place of birth and place of residence are two distinct concepts in law; data for one cannot supply the omission of the other [1].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner’s total income of P230.00 a month is clearly not lucrative. Citing *Sy v. Republic* and *Uy v. Republic*, the Court held that even an income of P250.00 or P300.00 a month for an unmarried applicant does not meet the lucrative trade, profession, or occupation requirement for naturalization [2].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DENIED**.
