I. CAPTION
ELTON W. CHASE v. THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, BRANCH XIV, et al., G.R. No. L-20457, October 29, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Elton Chase, a minority stockholder of American Machinery & Parts Manufacturing, Inc. (AMPARTS), filed a derivative suit against the majority stockholders and directors (the Buencaminos) for breach of trust, removal of directors, and dissolution of the corporation [1, 2]. He also applied for the appointment of a receiver. The trial court denied the receivership application but required the respondents to file a P100,000.00 bond to answer for damages [3]. Subsequently, the trial court rendered a judgment on the merits finding respondent Dr. Victor Buencamino, Sr. guilty of mismanagement and ordering him to pay the corporation P1,970,200.00 [3]. Chase filed another motion for the appointment of a receiver pending satisfaction of the judgment [4]. The trial court (Judges Gatmaitan and De Veyra) denied the motion but issued orders granting Chase free access to corporate records and a "veto right," wherein management decisions had to be made known to him; if he objected, the matter would be resolved by the court and the decision suspended in the interim [5-7]. Chase filed a petition for certiorari alleging grave abuse of discretion [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the appointment of a receiver despite the finding of mismanagement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the appointment of a receiver is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the court and should be exercised with great caution, only when the necessity is clear [8, 9]. While minority stockholders may resort to receivership when directors are guilty of breach of trust, it is not mandatory if other remedies exist [9]. In this case, the trial court adopted "proper precautionary measures" for the protection of the petitioner's rights—specifically the filing of a bond and the granting of veto rights over management decisions [10, 11]. Since these measures sufficiently protected the petitioner's interest without the drastic step of taking over the corporate business, the court did not abuse its discretion [11, 12].

The petition is dismissed [11].
