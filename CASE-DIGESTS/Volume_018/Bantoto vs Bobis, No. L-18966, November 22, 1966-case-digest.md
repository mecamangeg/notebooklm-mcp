**I. CAPTION**
**VICENTE BANTOTO, ET AL. v. SALVADOR BOBIS, ET AL. (CRISPIN VALLEJO, defendant-appellant)**, G.R. No. L-18966, November 22, 1966, 18 SCRA 690, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Crispin Vallejo was the registered owner of a jeepney operated by his driver, Salvador Bobis. On October 24, 1948, due to Bobis’ negligence, the jeepney struck and killed 3-year-old Damiana Bantoto. Bobis pleaded guilty to homicide through reckless imprudence in the criminal case and was sentenced to imprisonment and to pay the heirs of the deceased P3,000.00 as indemnity.

Subsequently, the parents of the deceased (Bantoto, et al.) filed a civil action against Bobis and Vallejo to enforce Vallejo's subsidiary liability, seeking the indemnity plus moral and exemplary damages. Vallejo moved to dismiss, arguing the complaint failed to state a cause of action because it did not allege that the driver Bobis was insolvent. The trial court denied the motion and rendered judgment ordering Vallejo to pay P3,000.00 indemnity, P1,000.00 exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. Vallejo appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N a complaint against an employer to enforce subsidiary civil liability must allege the insolvency of the employee.
2. W/N the employer is liable for exemplary damages when none were imposed on the employee in the criminal case.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that the master’s liability under the Revised Penal Code for crimes committed by employees is not predicated upon the insolvency of the latter for the rendition of judgment, but only for the execution of said judgment. Under **Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code**, insolvency is not a condition precedent. By analogy to a guarantor under **Article 2060 of the Civil Code**, the master cannot demand prior exhaustion of the servant’s properties if he cannot point out available property of the debtor. The employer is in a better position to determine the solvency of his employee; thus, the specific allegation of insolvency in the complaint is unnecessary [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that where the civil action is predicated on the criminal conviction, the award of exemplary damages against the employer is improper if no such damages were imposed on the employee. As a person subsidiarily liable, the master cannot incur greater civil liability than the convicted employee, similar to how a guarantor cannot be responsible for more than the principal debtor (**Article 2064, Civil Code**) [3].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision is **MODIFIED** by eliminating the award of P1,000.00 exemplary damages and doubling the award for attorney's fees to P1,000.00; the indemnity of P3,000.00 is **AFFIRMED**.
