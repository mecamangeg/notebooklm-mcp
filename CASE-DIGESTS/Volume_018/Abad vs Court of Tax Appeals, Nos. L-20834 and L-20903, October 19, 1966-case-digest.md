I. CAPTION
ARMANDO L. ABAD, doing business as REPUBLIC ALCOHOL DISTILLERY v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS and COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. Nos. L-20834 and L-20903, October 19, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Armando L. Abad operated a distillery. From January 1955 to August 1958, he used rectified or ethyl alcohol to produce "specially denatured alcohol," which he sold to grantees for use in manufacturing industrial products (e.g., varnish, fuel). Abad did not pay specific tax on the ethyl alcohol used. During the same period, he also produced "completely denatured alcohol." For the latter, he paid the 7% sales tax on gross sales but deducted the cost of the ethyl alcohol raw material purchased from suppliers, even though those suppliers had not paid specific or sales taxes.

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed Abad for: (1) specific tax on the ethyl alcohol used to produce specially denatured alcohol; and (2) deficiency sales tax on the completely denatured alcohol, disallowing the deduction of the raw material cost. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled that Abad was liable for the specific tax but not for the deficiency sales tax. Both parties appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Abad is liable for specific tax on the rectified/ethyl alcohol used to produce specially denatured alcohol.
2. W/N the cost of ethyl alcohol raw material is deductible from the gross selling price of completely denatured alcohol for sales tax computation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO** (for the period Jan. 1955 to Aug. 22, 1956) and **YES** (for the period Aug. 23, 1956 to Aug. 1958).
For the period prior to August 23, 1956, the specific tax did not attach to alcohol upon its coming into existence under Republic Act No. 592. Following the doctrine in *La Tondeña, Inc. v. Collector*, the producer of the taxable finished product (the buyer), not the producer of the alcohol sold to permittees, is liable. However, **Republic Act No. 1608**, effective August 23, 1956, amended Section 133 of the Tax Code to state that the tax attaches to distilled spirits "as soon as it is in existence as such." Thus, for alcohol produced after this date, Abad is liable as the manufacturer/possessor. The Court also rejected Abad's claim of exemption under Section 128 (use in arts and industries), ruling that the exemption applies to denatured alcohol itself, not the resultant mixtures.

2. **YES**.
Under the first part of Section 186 of the Tax Code, sales of ethyl alcohol are subject to sales tax. Consequently, the proviso of the same section allows the total cost of such materials to be deducted from the gross selling price of the manufactured article (completely denatured alcohol). The Court held that the fact that Abad's suppliers did not actually pay the tax does not prevent Abad from deducting the cost.

**Disposition:** The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is MODIFIED. Petitioner Abad is ordered to pay specific tax only on the alcohol produced from August 23, 1956 to August 1958. The ruling appearing in favor of Abad regarding the sales tax is AFFIRMED.
