I. CAPTION
DIOSDADA SABINO v. CONRADO CUBA, G.R. No. L-18328, December 17, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Diosdada Sabino filed a complaint for forcible entry and detainer against her cousin, defendant Conrado Cuba, regarding a portion of land covered by Tax Declaration No. 2960. The Justice of the Peace Court ruled in favor of Sabino. On appeal to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte, the parties entered into an amicable settlement (compromise agreement) on January 13, 1960. Under the agreement, Sabino agreed to pay P250.00 to Cuba, and Cuba recognized Sabino's absolute ownership over the *entire* property described in Tax Declaration No. 2960, agreeing to restore possession to her. The CFI rendered judgment based on this compromise on the same day.

Sabino paid the P250.00, and Cuba delivered the fruits of the land. However, on May 20, 1960, Cuba filed a motion to modify the judgment, alleging mistake. He claimed he was unaware that a portion of land he had possessed since 1948 was part of the property under Tax Declaration No. 2960. The CFI granted the motion, ordered an ocular inspection, and approved a commissioner's report which found a discrepancy in the land area. Sabino moved for reconsideration, arguing the court lost jurisdiction as the judgment was already final, but the motion was denied. Sabino appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court had jurisdiction to reopen or modify the judgment based on the compromise agreement after it had become final and executory.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the challenged orders. A judgment upon a compromise has the force of *res judicata* between the parties and is immediately final and executory. Under **Article 2037 of the Civil Code**, a compromise cannot be disturbed except for vices of consent or forgery, as its purpose is to settle issues once and for all.

The Court ruled that the defendant is estopped from questioning the compromise agreement or claiming mistake because he had already received the consideration (P250.00) and had expressly recognized the plaintiff's ownership over the *entire* property in the signed agreement. Furthermore, regarding the alleged discrepancy in land area, the Court reiterated the rule that in case of conflict, boundaries prevail over area. Since the judgment had become final and was already executed, the lower court's jurisdiction was limited only to its enforcement, not its modification.

The orders of the lower court reopening the case were set aside.
