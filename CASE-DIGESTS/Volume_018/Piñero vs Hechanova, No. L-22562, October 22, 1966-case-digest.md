I. CAPTION
LEON S. PIÑERO, ET AL. v. RUFINO HECHANOVA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22562, October 22, 1966, 18 SCRA 417, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Piñero, et al., comprising 32 employees of the Port Patrol Division of the Bureau of Customs, were dismissed from service between December 1962 and January 1963 by respondents Acting Secretary of Finance Hechanova and Acting Commissioner of Customs De Joya. The dismissal was based on "loss of confidence," as respondents argued that under Executive Order No. 397 (Series of 1941) and Executive Order No. 94 (Series of 1947), the positions in the Customs Patrol Service were declared "primarily confidential," making the occupants' term co-terminal with the confidence of the appointing power. Petitioners, who mostly held permanent appointments and had served for years, filed a petition for mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI ruled in favor of petitioners, ordering their reinstatement with back salaries. The court held that under the Civil Service Law (R.A. 2260), they could not be removed without cause and hearing. Respondents appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioners' positions in the Customs Patrol Service are "primarily confidential" such that they may be removed for mere lack of confidence.
2. W/N the petitioners are estopped from claiming security of tenure having accepted appointments under an Executive Order declaring their positions primarily confidential.
3. W/N the suit constitutes a suit against the State without its consent.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that under Section 5 of the Civil Service Act of 1959 (R.A. 2260), it is the **nature** of the functions attached to the position that ultimately determines whether it is primarily confidential, policy-determining, or highly technical. Executive pronouncements or fiats are merely initial determinations and are not conclusive in case of conflict with the actual nature of the position. Citing *De los Santos v. Mallare*, the Court explained that "primarily confidential" denotes "close intimacy which insures freedom of intercourse without embarrassment or freedom from misgivings of betrayals of personal trust." There was no evidence of such close intimacy between the appointing power and the members of the Customs Patrol force. Therefore, petitioners belong to the Civil Service and enjoy security of tenure under Section 32 of R.A. 2260; they cannot be removed except for cause and with due process.

2. **NO.** The fact that petitioners accepted appointments under Executive Order No. 397, which characterized the positions as confidential, does not place them in estoppel. The subsequent enactment of the Civil Service Act of 1959 determined their tenure based on the nature of the position itself. Furthermore, Section 40 of R.A. 2260 expressly prohibits the waiver of rights accruing to civil service employees.

3. **NO.** A case where employees seek reinstatement with back salaries is not considered a suit against the State requiring its consent (citing *Ruiz v. Cabahug*). The payment of back salaries is merely incidental to the determination of the legality of the dismissal.

The decision of the Court of First Instance is **AFFIRMED**.
