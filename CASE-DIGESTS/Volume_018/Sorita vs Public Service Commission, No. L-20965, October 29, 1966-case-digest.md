I. CAPTION
JOHNNY SORITA, ET AL. v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION and ANGEL FORNEAS, G.R. No. L-20965, October 29, 1966, 18 SCRA 516, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Angel Forneas filed an application with the Public Service Commission (PSC) for a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) to operate motorboats for passenger and freight service along the Cagayan River [1]. Petitioners Johnny Sorita et al., who were existing operators of motorboats with Bureau of Customs permits, opposed the application [1]. They filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that under Section 13(a) of the Public Service Act (Commonwealth Act No. 146), the PSC had no jurisdiction to require a CPC for motorboats [1], [2]. The PSC denied the motion to dismiss and granted Forneas the certificate, finding him financially qualified and determining that public necessity demanded the service [2]. Petitioners appealed, contending that the law exempts motorboats from the CPC requirement [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N motorboats operating on navigable inland rivers are required to secure a Certificate of Public Convenience from the Public Service Commission.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Public Service Commission [3].

The Court ruled that while Section 13(a) of the Public Service Act limits the PSC's authority over "steamboats, motorships, and steamship lines," this exemption does not extend to all watercraft [4], [5]. Reading Section 13(a) in relation to Section 13(b), which separately categorizes "pontines, ferries, and water craft," the Court held that the exemption applies only to vessels of "considerable tonnage" engaged in interisland or coastwise sea service involving open waters [6], [5]. Motorboats and watercraft of a size and construction fit merely for river navigation and devoted to inter-municipal transportation must first secure a CPC from the PSC before operating as common carriers [7]. The Court relied on the doctrine in *Municipality of Gattaran v. Elizaga*, which mandates that ferry operators must obtain a CPC to ensure proper regulation of rates and equipment [7], [8]. Furthermore, public interest dictates this requirement because the Bureau of Customs lacks the resources to effectively supervise inland river transport, leaving the PSC as the necessary regulatory body to ensure public safety and discipline [9], [10].

The decision of the Public Service Commission is affirmed [3].
