**I. CAPTION**
**FIREMAN'S FUND INSURANCE CO. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY**, G.R. No. L-21412, September 28, 1966, Castro, J.

**II. FACTS**
The vessel "SS President Grant" arrived in Manila on April 27, 1959, and completed the discharge of 48 boxes of telephone parts into the custody of defendant Manila Port Service (MPS) on April 28, 1959 [1]. MPS delivered only 47 boxes to the consignee, Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) [1]. PLDT filed a provisional claim on May 4, 1959, and a formal claim on October 15, 1959 [1]. On October 16, 1959, MPS acknowledged the claim, stating it was under "careful consideration" [2].

Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., as insurer and subrogee of the consignee, filed a complaint against MPS in the Municipal Court of Manila on June 21, 1961, to recover the value of the missing box [3]. MPS argued that the action had prescribed under Paragraph 15 of their Management Contract, which requires suit to be brought within one year from the date of discharge or from the date the claim is rejected [4, 5]. MPS had sent a letter on April 4, 1961, denying the claim due to prescription [4].

The Municipal Court ruled in favor of Fireman's Fund [6]. On appeal, the Court of First Instance (CFI) affirmed, holding that the April 4, 1961 letter was the effective rejection, and since the suit was filed on June 21, 1961 (within one year of that rejection), the action had not prescribed [7]. MPS appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the action filed by Fireman's Fund against the Manila Port Service has prescribed.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision.

The Court applied the doctrine laid down in *Continental Insurance Company vs. Manila Port Service* (G.R. No. L-22208) and *Delgado Brothers vs. Manila Port Service* (G.R. No. L-21781). The rule establishes that when an arrastre contractor fails to act on a claim within one year from the complete discharge of goods, the claim is deemed rejected as of the expiry date of that one-year period [8]. Consequently, the action must be filed within one year from such expiry date [8].

Here, the cargo was discharged on April 28, 1959 [9]. The one-year period from discharge ended on April 28, 1960 [9]. Since MPS took no action on the claim within that year other than a perfunctory acknowledgment, the claim was deemed rejected on April 28, 1960 [9]. Therefore, the plaintiff had one year from April 28, 1960—until April 28, 1961—to file suit [9]. Since the complaint was filed only on June 21, 1961, the action had already prescribed [9, 10].

**Judgment reversed.**
