I. CAPTION
**CATALINA PONS CALDERON, as guardian of minors ANTONIO P. CALDERON and MILAGROS P. CALDERON, et al. v. LEONARDO MEDINA**, G.R. No. L-17634, October 29, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
In November 1956, petitioner Catalina Pons Calderon, acting as guardian for her minor children, executed a mortgage on their property in favor of respondent Leonardo Medina. Calderon petitioned the guardianship court (Special Proceedings No. 647) for authority to mortgage the property to secure a loan of P15,000 for the construction of an apartment. The court approved the mortgage on December 15, 1956. The notarized deed of mortgage expressly acknowledged the receipt of the P15,000 consideration.

Later, Calderon filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to cancel the mortgage. She alleged that the true agreement was for Medina to finance the construction of the apartment, which he failed to do, resulting in a failure of consideration. Medina denied this, asserting it was a straight loan. During the trial, Calderon attempted to testify that they never received the money. The trial court sustained Medina's objection based on the parol evidence rule and estoppel, subsequently dismissing the complaint.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners can nullify the mortgage deed based on parol evidence of failure of consideration.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. While the Court acknowledged the rule in *Maulini v. Serrano* that parol evidence is generally admissible to prove failure of consideration, it held that a mere denial of receipt is insufficient to overthrow a public instrument.

The Court ruled that the deed, being a notarized public instrument, is evidence of the clear and unequivocal facts stated therein. To contradict the recitals of a public deed, the evidence must be "clear, convincing and more than merely preponderant" (*Mendezona v. Philippine Sugar Estates Dev. Co.*). The biased testimony of the grantor (Calderon) cannot prevail over the notarized document. Furthermore, Calderon is **estopped** from denying the truth of the mortgage's contents because she judicially sought its approval from the guardianship court, representing it as a security for a loan to benefit her wards.

**Decision affirmed.**

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Reyes, J.B.L., J.**, concurred in the result.
