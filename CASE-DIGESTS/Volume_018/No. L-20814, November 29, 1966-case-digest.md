I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. CARMEN DY alias DY GIOK KHA, petitioner-appellee, vs. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, oppositor-appellant., G.R. No. L-20814, November 29, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Carmen Dy filed a petition for admission to Philippine citizenship, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Occidental Misamis [1]. The Republic of the Philippines appealed the decision [1]. The evidence showed that the petitioner alleged an annual income of P2,400.00 (or P200.00 a month), with gross receipts in 1959 amounting to only P1,713.16, while having five dependent children of school age [2]. Additionally, while her birth certificate and alien certificate of registration bore the name "Carmen Dy," her 1951 immigration certificate of residence indicated she began using the alias "Dy Giok Kha" without previous judicial authority [3]. Finally, she enrolled all six of her children in Chinese schools, only transferring two of them to a Catholic school after filing her petition [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the petitioner’s use of an alias disqualifies her from naturalization.
3. W/N the petitioner evinced a sincere desire to embrace Filipino customs and traditions.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** An income of P200.00 a month is far from being "lucrative" within the purview of the Naturalization Law, particularly considering that the petitioner has five dependent children of school age [2]. The Court relied on established jurisprudence such as *Keng Giok v. Republic* to determine the financial insufficiency [2].

2. **YES.** The use of an alias, specifically "Dy Giok Kha," without securing previous judicial authority constitutes a violation of the Anti-Alias Law [3]. This violation is a sufficient ground for denying the application for naturalization [3, 6].

3. **NO.** By enrolling every one of her six children in Chinese schools, the petitioner failed to evince a sincere desire to embrace the customs and traditions of the Filipinos [5]. Although she transferred two children to a Catholic school after filing the petition, this belated act did not detract from the fact that her behavior at the time of commencement showed a lack of earnest intention to identify herself and her children with the Filipino community [4, 5].

The decision appealed from is REVERSED, and the petition for naturalization is DISMISSED [7].
