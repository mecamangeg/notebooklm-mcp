I. CAPTION
CONSUELO CARAAN-MEDINA v. CARMELO QUIZON, G.R. No. L-23162, October 29, 1966, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Consuelo Caraan-Medina was an Assistant Provincial Fiscal of Batangas. Under the Department of Justice's administrative order, she was the fifth ranking fiscal. When the third ranking fiscal, Gregorio Panganiban, vacated his position to run for office, Respondent Carmelo Quizon was designated as "Acting Assistant Provincial Fiscal." Subsequently, Republic Act No. 3719 was enacted, fixing specific salaries for the first through fifth assistant fiscals. Quizon was later appointed by the President as the "third assistant provincial fiscal" and confirmed by the Commission on Appointments.

Petitioner filed a *quo warranto* petition directly with the Supreme Court, claiming Quizon's appointment was void. She argued that upon the vacancy of the third position and the passage of R.A. 3719, she automatically ascended from fifth to third rank by operation of law; thus, the position was not vacant for Quizon to fill.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner has a clear right to the office of third assistant provincial fiscal via automatic succession.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition. In *quo warranto* proceedings, the petitioner must prove a *clear* right to the office alleged to be usurped (citing *Castro v. Solidum* and *Batario, Jr. v. Parentela, Jr.*). The Court held that, unless otherwise provided by law, succession to a higher rank or position is not automatic but requires official action by the proper authorities. There is no provision of law or administrative regulation in this case that allows for such automatic succession.

Furthermore, the Court noted that even if automatic succession were the rule, the petitioner would not be the successor. As the fifth ranking fiscal, she would not bypass the fourth ranking fiscal (Marcelo T. Lota) to fill the third ranking position vacated by Panganiban. Since the petitioner did not automatically fill the vacancy, Respondent Quizon's appointment to the position was valid.

The petition is dismissed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Justices Concepcion, Reyes, Dizon, Regala, Bengzon, and Zaldivar concurred).
