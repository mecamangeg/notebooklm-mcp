I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LIBERATO GAGUI**, G.R. No. L-20200, October 28, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of June 26, 1955, in Lubao, Pampanga, four men, including appellant Liberato Gagui and co-accused Arsenio Mañgila, entered the hut of spouses Benito Sarmiento and Patrocinia Millares. After being allowed to cook and eat fish, the men turned on the spouses. Three of them took Benito downstairs, demanded money, and stabbed him, causing him to flee into the fishpond. Meanwhile, Mañgila remained in the hut, opened the trunk, and took various items. Gagui then returned, threatened Patrocinia with a knife, and raped her, followed by the other three men.

The Court of First Instance of Pampanga convicted Gagui and Mañgila of robbery with rape complexed with less serious physical injuries, sentencing them to an indeterminate penalty of *reclusion temporal*. Mañgila accepted the sentence, but Gagui appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA found that the proper penalty was *reclusion perpetua* and certified the case to the Supreme Court. Gagui raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was in jail in Bataan at the time, and argued that his extrajudicial confessions were involuntary.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over the positive identification of the accused.
2. W/N the appellant's extrajudicial confessions were involuntary and inadmissible.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the defense of alibi cannot stand against the positive identification of the defendant made by the victims themselves [1]. The hut was adequately lighted, and the accused stayed inside for a considerable time, allowing for ample identification [2]. Furthermore, the alibi was belied by the appellant's own affidavits which narrated the events in detail [2]. The police blotter offered to prove his alibi was disregarded as hearsay because the Chief of Police who signed it was not presented as a witness [3].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the confessions were not involuntary [4]. The Fiscal testified that he read the contents of the documents to the appellant, who affirmed their truth before him [5]. The signing was also witnessed by a constabulary sergeant who testified for the prosecution in rebuttal [5].

**Judgment modified.**
