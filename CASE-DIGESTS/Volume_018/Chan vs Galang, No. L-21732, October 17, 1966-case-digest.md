I. CAPTION
SANTOS CHAN, SO MING LEE and AMBROSIO CABO CHENG v. EMILIO L. GALANG, in his capacity as Commissioner of Immigration, G.R. No. L-21732, October 17, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner So Ming Lee, a Portuguese national, entered the Philippines as a temporary visitor on May 6, 1957, with a stay valid until July 13, 1957. A bond was posted by petitioner Ambrosio Cabo Cheng. On July 8, 1957, she married petitioner Santos Chan, a Filipino citizen. Two days later, she petitioned the Commissioner of Immigration for the cancellation of her alien certificate of registration, claiming she had acquired Filipino citizenship by marriage. Pending this, she requested an extension of stay, which was denied.

So Ming Lee failed to depart upon the expiration of her stay. Consequently, the Commissioner ordered her bond confiscated and her arrest effected. The Commissioner also denied reconsideration, citing that both spouses had previous marriages and declaring their marriage void [1, 2].

Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to annul the Commissioner’s orders and declare So Ming Lee a Filipino citizen. Instead of answering, the Commissioner filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground that the petition was premature and stated no cause of action. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the Board of Immigration Commissioners had not yet decided on the matter, and the proper remedy was habeas corpus. Petitioners appealed [3-5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal of the petition upon a motion to dismiss before the filing of an answer was procedurally proper.
2. W/N the petition was premature because the issue of citizenship should first be resolved by the Board of Commissioners.
3. W/N the petition may be entertained as an action for declaratory relief.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The rules in ordinary actions, including the filing of a motion to dismiss under Rule 16 (formerly Rule 8), apply to special civil actions unless inconsistent therewith. There is no inconsistency in this case. Dismissal is proper if, before the answer is filed, the court's attention is called to the fact that the petition appears to be without merit or premature based on its own allegations [6-9].

2. **YES.** The specific issue of citizenship, upon which the right to stay depends, must first be resolved by the Board of Commissioners. An alien woman marrying a Filipino does not automatically become a Filipino; she must prove she possesses all qualifications and none of the disqualifications for naturalization [9-11]. The Commissioner of Immigration has the authority to conduct preliminary proceedings and pass upon the validity of an alien's marriage to determine if a prima facie case for deportation exists [12-14]. The remedy for an alien whose stay has expired is to leave the country and apply for reentry, not to seek prohibition against deportation [15, 16].

3. **NO.** Declaratory relief is discretionary. The court may refuse to exercise this power when the declaration is not necessary or proper under the circumstances. In this case, the proper forum to first resolve the disputed citizenship is the Board of Commissioners, not the courts [17, 18].

**Order affirmed.**
