I. CAPTION
LAURENTIO ARMENTIA v. ERLINDA PATRIARCA, FLORENCIA SOMECIERA, JULIANA ARMENTIA, JOSE SOMECIERA and SOFRONIO FLORES, G.R. No. L-18210, December 29, 1966, 18 SCRA 1253, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Marta Armentia executed a notarial document on July 22, 1955, adjudicating a parcel of land to herself and selling it to defendants Erlinda Patriarca and Florencia Someciera (then minors) for P99.00. The document was registered, and a new title was issued to the defendants on the same date. Marta died intestate and without forced heirs on May 28, 1960. On September 17, 1960, her brother, plaintiff Laurentio Armentia, filed a suit to annul the sale, alleging it was simulated, fictitious, and fraudulently executed. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of lack of cause of action and prescription. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo dismissed the case, ruling that the action to annul the sale had prescribed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the plaintiff, as a brother and intestate heir of the deceased vendor, has the cause of action to annul the sale.
2. W/N the action for annulment has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The plaintiff has no cause of action. Under Article 1397 of the Civil Code, the action for annulment may be instituted by all who are thereby obliged principally or subsidiarily. The plaintiff is not a forced heir and was not obliged under the contract. The deceased, having no forced heirs, was free to dispose of her property. Since no creditors were defrauded and no legitimes were impaired, the plaintiff, as a collateral relative, lacks the personality to attack the validity of the voluntary sale made by his sister [1, 2].

2. **YES.** Even assuming the plaintiff had a cause of action, the suit is barred by prescription. An action to annul a contract based on fraud must be filed within four years from the discovery thereof (Arts. 1146[3] and 1391, Civil Code). Discovery is reckoned from the time the document was registered in the Registry of Deeds, which serves as notice to the whole world. Since the document was registered on July 22, 1955, and the complaint was filed only on September 17, 1960, the four-year prescriptive period had already elapsed [4, 5].

The Order of the lower court is AFFIRMED.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Reyes, J.B.L., J., concurring:**
Justice Reyes concurred in the result but disagreed with the majority's premise that intestate heirs have no standing to contest a sale if it is fictitious or lacks consideration. He argued that under Article 1409, contracts with a false or non-existent cause are void *ab initio*, and the property remains part of the estate, recoverable by heirs. However, he agreed to affirm because the plaintiff failed to prove that the price was non-existent, making the transaction onerous and valid [6-10].
