I. CAPTION
VICTORIO MERCADO, ET AL. v. THE HONORABLE JUDGE FELIX R. DOMINGO, FLORENCIO GAGUI, BERNARDO MAGPAYO, EDUARDO BONGCO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19457, December 17, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners (plaintiffs) filed a civil case for rescission of contract and declaration of ownership against private respondents (defendants). The defendants were declared in default, and the trial court rendered a decision in favor of petitioners on January 30, 1960. The defendants received notice of the decision on **February 29, 1960** [1].

On March 29, 1960, respondents Gagui and Magpayo filed a motion for reconsideration and new trial, which was denied; they received the denial on April 13, 1960 [1], [2]. On **May 7, 1960**—more than 60 days after learning of the judgment—all defendants filed a **Petition for Relief** under Rule 38, alleging excusable negligence because their counsel's brother-in-law misplaced the order denying their previous motion to dismiss [2].

The trial court (Judge Domingo) granted the petition for relief. It ruled that the 14-day period during which the motion for new trial was pending should be deducted from the 60-day period prescribed by Rule 38, making the May 7 filing timely [3]. Petitioners filed a certiorari petition with the Supreme Court, arguing the trial court abused its discretion as the 60-day period is non-extendible [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the filing of a motion for new trial suspends the 60-day period for filing a petition for relief from judgment under Rule 38.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petition for relief was filed out of time and the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in granting it.

The Court ruled that the filing of a motion for reconsideration or new trial, while it suspends the period for the finality of the judgment (for purposes of appeal), **does not suspend the 60-day period provided for in Rule 38** [4]. It has been constantly held that the periods fixed by Rule 38 are mandatory and non-extendible and are not subject to any condition or contingency [4].

Under Section 3 of Rule 38 (old Rules), a petition for relief must be filed within 60 days after the petitioner learns of the judgment and not more than six months after such judgment was entered [5]. Since the respondents learned of the judgment on February 29, 1960, the 60-day period expired in late April. The filing on May 7, 1960, was late. The Court further noted that a party may seek relief from an order of default as soon as they learn of it without waiting for the judgment on the merits to become final [5]. Additionally, the excuse regarding misplaced mail was deemed "incredible and not constitutive of excusable negligence" [6].

Petition granted; the trial court's orders are set aside, and the judgment on the merits is declared final and executory [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Concepcion, Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred with the decision [7].
