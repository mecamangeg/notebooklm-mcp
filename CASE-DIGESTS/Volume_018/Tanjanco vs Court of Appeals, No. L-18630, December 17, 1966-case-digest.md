**I. CAPTION**
APOLONIO TANJANCO v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS and ARACELI SANTOS, G.R. No. L-18630, December 17, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Apolonio Tanjanco and respondent Araceli Santos, both adults, became acquainted in December 1957 [3]. Tanjanco courted Santos, professing his love [4]. Starting in July 1958, Santos consented to have carnal knowledge of Tanjanco, allegedly due to his repeated promises of marriage [4]. They maintained intimate sexual relations regularly for one whole year until July 1959 [5]. When Santos became pregnant, Tanjanco refused to marry her and stopped seeing her [6]. Santos resigned from her job to avoid embarrassment and filed a complaint for support and damages [2].

The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action [7]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the dismissal, ruling that while no action exists to compel marriage, the complaint stated a cause of action for damages under Article 21 of the Civil Code [7, 8]. Tanjanco appealed to the Supreme Court [8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Araceli Santos is entitled to recover damages for seduction under Article 21 of the Civil Code. [8, 9]

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and affirmed the CFI's dismissal.

The Court held that for a case to fall under Article 21 of the Civil Code, the essential feature is **seduction**, which implies deceit, enticement, superior power, or abuse of confidence to which the woman yields [9]. Citing *U.S. v. Buenaventura*, the Court explained that if a woman consents merely from carnal lust or mutual desire, there is no seduction [10].

In this case, the facts showed that Santos, an adult woman, maintained intimate relations with Tanjanco for a whole year [5]. The Court reasoned that such conduct is incompatible with the idea of seduction. If she had surrendered exclusively because of deceit, she would not have yielded repeatedly for a year without exacting the early fulfillment of the promise of marriage [5]. The extended duration indicates "voluntariness and mutual passion" rather than deceit [5]. Since mere breach of promise to marry is not actionable and the elements of Article 21 were not met, no cause of action existed [11].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Concepcion, C.J., Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez and Castro, JJ., concurred) [12].
