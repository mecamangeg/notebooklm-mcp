I. CAPTION
THE GEORGE W. LUFT COMPANY, INC., petitioner, vs. NGO GUAN and DIRECTOR OF PATENTS, respondents, G.R. No. L-21915, December 17, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner George W. Luft Co., Inc., a foreign corporation, owns the trademark "Tangee," used since 1928 and registered in the Philippines in 1950 for various cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations [1, 2]. On January 22, 1959, respondent Ngo Guan applied to register the trademark "Tango" for hair pomade, alleging use since June 1958 [1]. Petitioner opposed the application, contending that "Tango" is confusingly similar to "Tangee" [1]. The Director of Patents overruled the opposition and granted Ngo Guan's application [3]. Petitioner sought review by certiorari [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trademark "Tango" is confusingly similar to "Tangee" such that its registration should be denied.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court found that the petitioner failed to prove that the trademarks are confusingly similar. One of the essential factors in determining confusing similarity is the general similarity in the appearance of the trademarks, which requires a physical examination and comparison [4]. Petitioner failed to introduce its own trademark "Tangee" in evidence, rendering such comparison impossible [4]. The Court held that this omission suggests that the appearance of "Tangee" is not analogous to that of respondent's "Tango" [4].

Moreover, the word "Tango" has a well-established meaning describing a dance, and the respondent's label depicts a man and woman dancing [2]. Furthermore, the respondent uses "Tango" exclusively for hair pomade, a product in which the petitioner does not deal; petitioner's "Tangee" covers products such as lipstick, rouge, and creams, but not pomade [2].

The decision and resolution of the Director of Patents are affirmed [5].
