I. CAPTION
**COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. AMERICAN RUBBER COMPANY and COURT OF TAX APPEALS / AMERICAN RUBBER COMPANY v. THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, ET AL.**, G.R. Nos. L-19667 and L-19801-03, November 29, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
American Rubber Company, a domestic corporation, produced various rubber products (Preserved Latex, Pale Crepe, Ribbed Smoked Sheets, Flat Bark Rubber, and Brown Crepe) from its plantation [1]. From 1955 to 1958, it paid sales taxes on these products under protest, claiming they were exempt agricultural products under Section 188(b) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) [2, 3]. The production involved adding chemicals (ammonia or acetic acid) to latex for preservation and faster coagulation, or milling natural coagulum (scrap rubber) into sheets [4-6]. The company separately billed the sales tax to its customers in invoices [7].

The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled that Preserved Latex, Flat Bark, and 3X Brown Crepe were exempt agricultural products, but classified Pale Crepe, Ribbed Smoked Sheets, and 2X Brown Crepe as manufactured products subject to tax [8]. The CTA also denied the refund of taxes passed on to customers [8]. Both the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) and American Rubber Company appealed [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the rubber products processed by the company are exempt agricultural products under Sec. 188(b) of the NIRC.
2. W/N the company is entitled to a refund of sales taxes that were billed to and paid by its customers.
3. W/N the company is entitled to interest on the refunded taxes.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that all the subject rubber products are exempt agricultural products [10, 11]. Section 188(b) exempts agricultural products "whether in their original form or not," meaning the exemption is not lost merely because the producer processes the goods to preserve them or make them market-ready [12]. The addition of chemicals like ammonia (to preserve latex) or acetic acid (to hasten coagulation) does not alter the agricultural nature of the product, as these processes merely accelerate natural changes or prevent spoilage [13, 14]. The definition of a "manufacturer" in Section 194(n) does not apply to Section 188(b) exemptions [15]. However, sales made between August 24, 1956, and June 22, 1957, are taxable because Republic Act No. 1612 temporarily restricted the exemption to products in their "original form" only [15].

2. **YES.** The company may recover the taxes even if passed on to customers [16, 17]. Sales tax is a direct liability of the producer/manufacturer, not the purchaser [17]. The separate billing of tax was merely a compliance step suggested by revenue regulations to avoid paying tax on the tax itself [18]. The Court distinguished this from *Medina v. City of Baguio*, where the tax was on admission tickets (effectively a tax on the public) [19]. Here, the tax money paid by customers is a matter solely between the taxpayer and its customers; the government has no right to retain illegal taxes [17].

3. **NO.** Interest on tax refunds is allowed only when the collection was attended with patent arbitrariness [20, 21]. The Court found no such arbitrariness in this case [21].

**DISPOSITION:** The CTA decision is AFFIRMED in L-19667 and MODIFIED in L-19801-03. The CIR is ordered to refund the taxes collected, except for the amount of P37,075.47 corresponding to the period when R.A. No. 1612 was in force [21].
