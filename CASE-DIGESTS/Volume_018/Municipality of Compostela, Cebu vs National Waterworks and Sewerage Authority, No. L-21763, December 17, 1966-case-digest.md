I. CAPTION
THE MUNICIPALITY OF COMPOSTELA, CEBU v. THE NATIONAL WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY, G.R. No. L-21763, December 17, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
In 1940, the Municipality of Compostela secured a P30,000.00 loan from the National Markets and Waterworks Fund to construct a waterworks system, which began operating in 1941 [1]. By 1953, the Municipality had a remaining balance of P29,807.90, the payment of which was later assumed and condoned by the National Government [1], [2].

In March 1956, the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) assumed the administration, operation, and maintenance of the waterworks system without the Municipality's consent, purportedly under Republic Act No. 1383 [3]. NAWASA argued that the system belonged to the National Government because it was funded by the latter [3]. The Municipality filed an action to recover ownership and control. The Court of First Instance of Cebu ruled in favor of the Municipality, declaring it the true owner [4], [5]. NAWASA appealed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N NAWASA can validly take over the administration and control of the municipal waterworks system under R.A. No. 1383.
2. W/N the Municipality has the authority to fix and collect fees for water supplied by the system.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The National Government cannot appropriate the patrimonial property of municipal corporations without just compensation and due process of law [6]. The Court held that the waterworks system is patrimonial property of the Municipality. The initial funding was a loan, making the Municipality the owner and debtor; the subsequent condonation by the National Government confirmed this creditor-debtor relationship, which would not exist if the government already owned the system [2]. Consequently, R.A. No. 1383 does not empower NAWASA to take over the administration of such property if it involves commingling income with other entities for the benefit of others, without appropriating the title through proper expropriation proceedings [6]. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *City of Baguio v. NAWASA* and *City of Cebu v. NAWASA* [6].

2. **YES.** Municipalities have the clear authority to fix and collect fees for water supplied by their waterworks systems. This authority is derived from Sections 2317 and 2308(f) of the Revised Administrative Code and Section 1 of Republic Act No. 2264 [7].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED [8].
