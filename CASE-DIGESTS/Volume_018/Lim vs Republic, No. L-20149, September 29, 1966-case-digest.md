I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF MANUEL SPIRIG LIM TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. MANUEL SPIRIG LIM v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20149, September 29, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Manuel Spirig Lim filed a petition for naturalization on May 1, 1958, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga City on April 4, 1959. Two years later, Lim filed a petition to take his oath of allegiance. The Republic opposed this, arguing Lim lacked lucrative employment and sufficient knowledge of the Philippine Government and Constitution. Lim, an engineering student in Manila and purchasing agent for two Zamboanga firms, earned P150.00/month at the time of filing, which purportedly increased to P250.00/month by the time of the oath-taking petition via a company owned by his father. During the June 10, 1961 hearing, Lim admitted ignorance of the Constitution's preamble. The trial court postponed the hearing, and on March 17, 1962, Lim recited the provisions verbatim, admitting he learned them only after the previous objection. The trial court granted the petition on March 24, 1962. Lim took his oath on April 14, 1962, before the order became final. The Republic appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner met the requirement of lucrative income.
2. W/N the petitioner possessed a sincere belief in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution.
3. W/N the administration of the oath was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that an income of P150.00 a month is far too meager to meet the law's requirement for lucrative employment [1]. An applicant's qualifications must be determined as of the date the application was filed, not subsequently [1]. The alleged increase to P250.00, derived from his father's company, was deemed "dubious" and adjusted merely for naturalization purposes, especially since Lim admitted his father would offer more income if needed to satisfy the law (*Lee vs. Republic*) [2].

2. **NO.** The proceedings showed that petitioner's belief in the principles of the Constitution was non-existent when he applied for citizenship [3]. His initial ignorance during the first hearing proved his knowledge was vague and his belief insincere [3]. The Supreme Court disapproved of the trial court's irregularity in "retrying" the case to allow the petitioner to memorize the Constitution after initially being found unqualified, noting this practice exposes courts to charges of favoritism [4].

3. **NO.** The administration of the oath on April 14, 1962, was premature as the order issued on March 24, 1962, had not yet become final and executory [5]. This haste constituted an attempt to render nugatory the government's right to appeal (*Ong So vs. Republic*) [5].

The appealed order is reversed, and the certificate of naturalization is cancelled and declared null and void.
