I. CAPTION
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. C.F. SHARP & COMPANY, INC., and/or DELGADO BROKERAGE CORPORATION, No. L-22974, October 28, 1966, 18 SCRA 462, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Insurance Company of North America insured a shipment of 74 cases of automotive parts consigned to Manila Trading & Supply Co. Upon arrival in Manila, Case No. 70 was found to contain three broken windshields. The plaintiff paid the consignee the damages and, as subrogee, filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against the carrier, C.F. Sharp & Co., Inc., and the customs broker, Delgado Brokerage Corporation (DELBROCO), in the alternative. The plaintiff was uncertain whether the loss occurred while the goods were with the carrier or the broker.

C.F. Sharp settled part of the claim. DELBROCO, however, moved to dismiss, arguing that the CFI lacked jurisdiction because the remaining amount involved (P328.73) was below the CFI's jurisdictional amount and should fall under the municipal court. The trial court denied the motion and rendered judgment holding DELBROCO liable, finding that the breakage occurred while the goods were in its custody. DELBROCO appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over a case joining an admiralty claim against a carrier and a small money claim against a broker in the alternative.
2. W/N the broker (DELBROCO) is liable for the damaged goods.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The suit against the carrier is predicated upon a contract of carriage by sea, which constitutes an admiralty case falling within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance [1]. The customs broker was properly joined as an alternative defendant because the causes of action arose out of the same transaction—the recovery of the value of the lost merchandise. Under Section 5, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court, when alternative causes of action arise from the same transaction, they may be joined; if one of the causes falls within the jurisdiction of the CFI (the admiralty claim), the suit shall be filed in said court, regardless of the amount claimed against the other defendant [2], [3].

2. **YES.** The trial court found as a fact that the windshields were broken while under the custody of DELBROCO. This factual finding is binding and will not be reviewed in an appeal confined to questions of law [4]. Furthermore, evidence showed that DELBROCO's authorized representative accepted the cargo "O.K. and complete," which is evidentiary of the condition of the goods when received by the broker [4].

The judgment appealed from is **AFFIRMED**, with treble costs against the appellant for filing a frivolous appeal [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
