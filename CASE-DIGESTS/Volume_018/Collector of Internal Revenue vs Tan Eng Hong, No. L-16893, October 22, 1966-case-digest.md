I. CAPTION
THE COLLECTOR (now COMMISSIONER) OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. TAN ENG HONG, G.R. No. L-16893, October 22, 1966, Regala, J. [1], [2]

II. FACTS
In 1952, the Philippine Council for United States Aid (PHILCUSA) conducted a public bidding for the supply of materials intended as aid to the Philippines. Respondent Tan Eng Hong won the bid and, from 1952 to 1955, delivered the goods to PHILCUSA, receiving a total of P94,685.71 [2]. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) assessed Tan Eng Hong for fixed and percentage taxes and surcharges amounting to P7,513.94, claiming the transactions were executed by him as a commercial broker [2].

Tan Eng Hong contested the assessment, arguing he was an importer and not a broker. He filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). The records showed that Tan Eng Hong signed proposals in his own name, opened letters of credit solely for his own account, and paid the foreign suppliers directly [3], [4]. The CTA reversed the BIR’s decision, cancelling the assessment and ruling that Tan Eng Hong was not a broker but an importer [5], [6]. The Collector of Internal Revenue appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Tan Eng Hong is liable for taxes as a commercial broker. [6], [7]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA decision. The essential feature of a commercial broker is that he acts not for himself, but for a third person (Section 194(t) of the Revenue Code; *Kuenzle & Streiff, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*; *Ker & Co. v. Collector of Internal Revenue*; *Behn, Meyer & Co. v. Nolting*) [7], [8].

In this case, Tan Eng Hong undertook the importation of goods for himself to discharge his personal obligation as the winning bidder. He would have been liable for damages to PHILCUSA had he failed to deliver [9]. The contracts were strictly between Tan Eng Hong and PHILCUSA, and between Tan Eng Hong and his foreign suppliers; there was no privity of contract between PHILCUSA and the foreign suppliers [10]. A broker must be the efficient agent or procuring cause of a sale between two parties (*Reyes v. Mosqueda*), but here, Tan Eng Hong acted with a distinct and independent personality as an importer, serving his own interest first and foremost [9], [11].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [12].
