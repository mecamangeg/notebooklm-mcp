I. CAPTION
RESURRECCION VDA. DE STA. ANA v. RODOLFO RIVERA, G.R. No. L-220470, October 29, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Vda. de Sta. Ana filed a collection suit against Petitioner Rivera. Rivera was declared in default on December 2, 1962, and the trial court subsequently rendered judgment on January 7, 1963, ordering him to pay P5,000.00 plus interest. Rivera filed a sworn petition for relief from judgment within the reglementary period, claiming he only learned of the judgment via garnishment and that he had executed the promissory note under usurious conditions and had already made partial payments. At the hearing for relief, Respondent's counsel admitted willingness to adjust the payments, effectively acknowledging that partial payments were made but were not disclosed to the court during the ex parte presentation of evidence. The trial court denied the petition for relief, ruling that Rivera failed to show excusable negligence, and denied his subsequent motion to amend the petition to allege fraud. Rivera appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for relief from judgment should be granted despite the alleged technical deficiencies regarding the petitioner's negligence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that technical rules must not stand in the way of granting a remedy when there is proof that the decision was not according to conscience, equity, and justice. The Court found that the Respondent committed fraud by taking advantage of the Petitioner's absence to conceal from the trial court that part of the claim had already been satisfied. This conduct was "repugnant to all canons of justice and fair play" and constituted an imposition upon the court.

The Court ruled that even if the Petitioner was negligent, that fact does not excuse the Respondent's "distortion and deceit in order to obtain judgment for a sum greater than what was due." The Court emphasized that it is the inescapable duty of litigants and counsel to present "the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth." Thus, the orders denying the petition were set aside, and the trial court was directed to grant a reopening and new trial.
