I. CAPTION
CHAN SHU LOU alias TAN WEB CHANG v. MARTINIANO P. VIVO, in his capacity as Acting Commissioner of Immigration and as Chairman of the Board of Commissioners, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22031, September 28, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Chan Shu Lou, a Chinese national and permanent resident of the Philippines since 1932, returned to the country in 1961 after a visit to his family [1]. The Board of Special Inquiry (BSI) admitted him as a properly documented returning resident on September 20, 1961 [2]. However, on November 17, 1962, Chan received a decision from the Board of Commissioners (BOC) dated September 4, 1962, reversing the BSI decision and claiming he had abandoned his residence [3]. Based on this, Acting Commissioner Vivo issued a deportation order [4].

Chan filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI found that the BOC decision was actually rendered after the one-year period prescribed by law and was merely antedated to September 4, 1962 to appear compliant [5]. This finding was supported by evidence that Chan was summoned by an Associate Commissioner regarding a "pending case" on October 4, 1962—a month after the alleged decision date [5, 6]. The CFI declared the BOC decision null and void for being issued beyond the one-year period in Section 27(b) of the Immigration Act of 1940 [7]. Vivo appealed, arguing the period is merely directory [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the one-year period prescribed in Section 27(b) of the Immigration Act for the Board of Commissioners to reverse a decision of the Board of Special Inquiry is mandatory.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that the one-year period is mandatory, not directory [9]. The Court held that viewing the period as directory would render the provision meaningless, "as if it were not there at all" [10]. Section 27(b) expressly states that the BSI decision "shall be final unless reversed by the Board of Commissioners within one year from promulgation" [10]. Thus, the decision becomes final upon promulgation, subject only to reversal within the specified time; absent a seasonable reversal, it remains final [10].

The Court emphasized that a contrary interpretation would leave the power of reversal hanging like a "sword of Damocles" over aliens, inviting graft and corruption and undermining the stability of administrative decisions [11]. The Court distinguished this from *Ong Se Lun v. Board of Immigration*, where the BSI decision was void *ab initio* for lack of authority (changing status from temporary to permanent); here, the BSI acted within its authority to determine facts of residence [12]. Consequently, the antedated BOC decision issued beyond the one-year period is void [7, 13].
