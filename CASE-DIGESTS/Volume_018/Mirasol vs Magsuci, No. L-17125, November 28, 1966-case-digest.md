I. CAPTION
BERNABE MIRASOL v. ANTONIO MAGSUCI, BIBIANO LAYGO and CRISANTA NATAL, G.R. No. L-17125, November 28, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
The subject property is a 2/5 undivided share of a lot in Iloilo City, originally owned by the heirs of Jose Miraflores. In 1951, the heirs leased this share to respondent Antonio Magsuci (via a written contract for a gasoline station) and to respondents Laygo and Natal (via informal month-to-month arrangements). On June 15, 1955, the heirs conveyed said 2/5 share in absolute sale to petitioner Bernabe Mirasol.

In August 1955, Mirasol notified the respondents of the sale and demanded that future rentals be paid to him. Magsuci refused, claiming privity of contract only with the original lessors. On March 23, 1956—after the sale—the original owners' attorney-in-fact executed a renewal of Magsuci's lease. Mirasol filed an action for unlawful detainer and recovery of unpaid rents. The trial court dismissed the complaint, reasoning that the 2/5 share was unsegregated and there was no proof the gasoline station stood exactly on Mirasol's portion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the vendee of a co-owned share can evict existing lessees for non-payment of rent despite the property being unsegregated.
2. W/N the lease renewal executed by the original owner's agent after the sale is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the portion leased to the respondents is the very same 2/5 portion sold to the petitioner. It is immaterial that the lot is unsegregated; the respondents' right to occupy is strictly confined to that 2/5 share, and the gasoline station could not have been lawfully constructed elsewhere. Citing *De Jesus v. Sociedad*, the Court ruled that upon the purchase of leased property and proper notice, the lessee is obliged to pay rent to the new owner, who steps into the shoes of the original lessor. Magsuci's refusal to pay rent to Mirasol entitled the latter to evict the lessees.

2. **NO.** The lease extension executed on March 23, 1956, was declared null and void. Since the sale to Mirasol was perfected in June 1955, the original owners' attorney-in-fact no longer had the authority to encumber the property at the time of the renewal.

Decision reversed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Reyes, J.B.L., J. (Concurring):** The lessee is in estoppel to contend that the lessor's share is located elsewhere than where the lessee erected the gasoline station. A lessee cannot deny his lessor's title.
