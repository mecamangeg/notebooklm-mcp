**I. CAPTION**
CIRILO LIM v. BASILISA DIAZ-MILLAREZ, G.R. No. L-17633, October 19, 1966, 18 SCRA 371, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 26, 1954, Cirilo Lim filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental for his appointment as judicial administrator of the estate of his deceased uncle, Jose Millarez, who died intestate on October 22, 1953 [1, 2]. Basilisa Diaz-Millarez, claiming to be the widow of the deceased, opposed the petition on the grounds that Lim had an adverse interest in the estate and that the properties involved were the subject of a pending litigation (Civil Case No. 2986) between them [2].

The trial court dismissed the special proceeding, noting that the civil case regarding the ownership of the properties was already pending appeal [3, 4]. Lim appealed the dismissal to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved questions of law [5]. Meanwhile, the Court of Appeals decided the related civil case (CA-G.R. 24561-R) on February 18, 1965, declaring that Basilisa was entitled to one-half of the estate as a common fund contributor and ordering Lim to account for P22,000.00 invested in a tobacco business [5-7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner is suitable to be appointed as administrator of the estate given his relation to the respondent and the estate.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court affirmed the order of dismissal, ruling that the petitioner is unsuitable for the position. The Court found that based on the decision in the related civil case, Lim had liabilities to Basilisa and the estate, specifically regarding the accounting of funds [7].

The Court applied the doctrine that an individual is considered unsuitable for appointment as administrator when he has an adverse interest of some kind or hostility to those immediately interested in the estate (*Sioca v. Garcia*, 44 Phil. 711; *Arevalo v. Bustamante*, 69 Phil. 656) [7]. Since Lim asserted a claim adverse to Basilisa (who was declared entitled to half the estate) and was indebted to the estate, he cannot compatibly perform the duties of an administrator [7, 8]. Furthermore, the determination of a person's suitability for the office rests on the sound judgment of the probate court, which will not be interfered with on appeal unless clearly in error [9, 10].

Petition DENIED. Order AFFIRMED.
