I. CAPTION
B. J. SERVER v. EPIFANIA CAR, G.R. No. L-22676, November 23, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On January 22, 1945, Epifania Car obtained a loan from B.J. Server in Japanese currency. She executed a promissory note agreeing to pay P2,500.00 in Philippine currency two years "from and after the cessation of hostilities of the Greater East Asia War in the Philippines," with 6% interest per annum and a 20% penalty for attorney's fees [1-3]. The parties stipulated that hostilities terminated on September 8, 1951 [4]. In 1953, Car offered to pay the loan based on the Ballantyne Scale of Values, but Server did not reply [4]. Server subsequently filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Albay for recovery of the sum. The CFI ruled in favor of Server, ordering Car to pay P2,500.00 on a peso-for-peso basis [5]. Car appealed, arguing that since she received Japanese currency, payment should be revalued under the Ballantyne Scale to avoid unjust enrichment [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the monetary obligation contracted during the Japanese occupation should be paid peso-for-peso in Philippine currency.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the obligation must be settled peso-for-peso in Philippine currency [7]. Under the rule consolidated in *Aguilar v. Miranda*, if an indebtedness incurred during the Japanese occupation was expressly agreed to be paid within a period where maturity falls after the war or liberation, the Ballantyne Scale does not apply unless clearly agreed otherwise [7, 8]. Instead, repayment must be made in accordance with the currency prevailing at the time of payment [7]. Since the promissory note stipulated payment after the cessation of hostilities, the parties are deemed to have intended that the amount be paid in the legal tender at the time the obligation became due (*Dizon v. Arrastia*) [6].

The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed [9].
