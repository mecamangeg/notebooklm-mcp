I. CAPTION
ESTEBAN M. SADANG and MARIA LACHICA v. GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-23448, October 28, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Sadang obtained loans totaling P173,000.00 from the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) secured by a real estate mortgage on their property in Manila. Upon their default, GSIS extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage. The notice of sale was published in the newspaper "Voz de Manila," and the property was sold to GSIS on December 2, 1959. GSIS subsequently filed for a writ of possession, which was granted and implemented in November 1960 without opposition from the spouses. Nearly two years later, in September 1962, the spouses filed an action to annul the sale, claiming "Voz de Manila" was not a newspaper of general circulation and that the notice was not published for three consecutive weeks. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N "Voz de Manila" is a newspaper of general circulation sufficient for valid publication of the foreclosure sale.
2. W/N the plaintiffs waived their right to object to the validity of the foreclosure sale.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** "Voz de Manila" contained news of general interest to the community and regularly carried court and foreclosure notices. The mere fact that it was published in Spanish and was not subscribed to by certain universities does not disqualify it as a newspaper of general circulation, as its contents would naturally not interest students instructed primarily in English. Furthermore, the editor's affidavit constituted *prima facie* evidence that the notice was published once a week for three consecutive weeks, which the plaintiffs failed to rebut.

2. **YES.** The plaintiffs were notified of the auction, the motion for writ of possession, and the actual delivery of the property to GSIS. They failed to object at any stage and remained inactive for nearly two years after possession was delivered. Under Rule 13, Section 5 of the Rules of Court, official duty is presumed regularly performed; thus, their inaction constitutes a waiver of their objection regarding the newspaper's circulation.

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**, and treble costs are imposed on the plaintiffs for filing a frivolous appeal.
