I. CAPTION
ELDO J. CARIÑO, ARSENIO C. MIGUEL, JOHNNY F. ILAR, SOTERO M. DE CASTRO, and GUSTAVO E. ESPINO v. AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND COOPERATIVE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION (ACCFA), et al., G.R. No. L-19808, September 29, 1966, 18 SCRA 183, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were permanent employees (lawyers and investigators) of the ACCFA. On September 17, 1958, the ACCFA Board of Governors abolished their positions, allegedly for reasons of economy, and terminated their services [1]. However, shortly after this abolition, appointments to new positions with different titles but involving the same work were extended to new appointees at higher salaries [1]. Petitioners sought reinstatement through letters to the ACCFA Board, the Civil Service Commissioner, and the Office of the President, but obtained no relief; the Office of the President cited a "policy of retrenchment" [2, 3].

They filed a petition for mandamus in the Court of First Instance of Manila. The trial court dismissed the petition on the ground that petitioners failed to exhaust administrative remedies but ordered ACCFA to pay separation pay and attorney's fees [2, 4]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the abolition of petitioners' positions was valid.
2. W/N the petitioners' positions being "primarily confidential" justifies removal without cause.
3. W/N the petition is barred by failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
4. W/N the petitioners are estopped from demanding reinstatement due to their acceptance of separation pay and terminal leave benefits.
5. W/N the petitioners are entitled to moral damages.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the abolition was a "mere subterfuge" to remove petitioners and replace them with political proteges [1]. While ostensibly for economy, the hiring of new appointees to perform the same work at higher salaries proved the abolition was in bad faith [1]. This constitutes a removal without cause, which is illegal for permanent civil service employees [6].

2. **NO.** The Court held that even if the positions were "primarily confidential," petitioners are still protected by the Constitution. Section 1, Article XII of the 1935 Constitution (exempting confidential positions from competitive exams) does not exempt such positions from Section 4, Article XII, which mandates that "No officer or employee in the Civil Service shall be removed or suspended except for cause as provided by law" [7, 8].

3. **NO.** The Court found that petitioners had substantially exhausted remedies by appealing to the Civil Service Commissioner and the Office of the President [9]. Furthermore, the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is not absolute; it does not apply when: (1) the question is purely legal, (2) the controverted act is "patently illegal," or (3) further administrative appeal would be a "useless ceremony," all of which were present in this case [9].

4. **NO.** The acceptance of separation pay did not amount to estoppel because the petitioners were "driven to the wall" and faced with harsh economic necessities [10]. Their acceptance was a case of "adherence, not of choice," and they did not relent in pressing their claim for reinstatement [10].

5. **NO.** The respondent officials were sued in their official capacities and cannot be held personally liable [11]. Moreover, moral damages are deemed "already included in, if not absorbed by, the back salaries" to which the petitioners are entitled [11].

**Disposition:** The judgment is MODIFIED. Respondents are ordered to reinstate the petitioners to their positions and pay back salaries from the date of dismissal (September 17, 1958) until reinstatement, less amounts received as separation pay. Attorney's fees are increased to P1,000 [12, 13].
