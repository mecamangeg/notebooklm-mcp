I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF JACINTO UY TIAN HUA, JR. TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. JACINTO UY TIAN HUA, JR. v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-20813, November 29, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On September 14, 1960, Jacinto Uy Tian Hua, Jr. filed a petition for naturalization, declaring a monthly income of P250.00 as a salesman [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance of Nueva Vizcaya granted the petition [1]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that P250.00 a month did not constitute a lucrative trade [1]. In response, the petitioner moved to reopen the case to present evidence of an increased gross income of P7,410.62 for 1961 and the acquisition of P5,000.00 in shares in 1962 [3]. The lower court granted the reopening and rendered a Supplemental Decision affirming the grant of citizenship [3]. On appeal, it was also discovered that the petitioner had resided in various addresses in Manila prior to moving to Nueva Vizcaya, which were not listed in his application [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner's increased income after the filing of the petition cures the lack of lucrative trade qualification.
2. W/N the failure to mention previous residences in the application is fatal to the petition.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that a petitioner's qualifications for naturalization must be determined as of the time of the filing of the petition [2]. At the time of filing in 1960, the petitioner had no income other than P250.00 a month, which is insufficient to be considered "lucrative" within the purview of the Naturalization Law [2]. The alleged increased income in 1961 and shares acquired in 1962 cannot cure his lack of qualification at the commencement of the action [2].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the failure to mention previous places of residence in the application is fatal to its allowance [4]. The petitioner failed to disclose his previous residences in Manila (Alvarado St., Reina Regente St., and Pennsylvania St.) in his application and the published notice [4]. Furthermore, the Court noted that the attesting witnesses failed to prove they were "credible persons" with a high reputation for probity [5].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DISMISSED** [6].
