I. CAPTION
EUGENIO C. DEL PRADO v. AUREA S. SANTOS, legal guardian of the minor JESUS SANTOS DEL PRADO, G.R. No. L-20946, September 23, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Anastacio C. del Prado died intestate and single on August 11, 1958 [1]. He was survived by his legitimate brother, petitioner Eugenio C. del Prado, and his illegitimate son, Jesus S. del Prado, born from his cohabitation with respondent Aurea S. Santos [1]. Anastacio expressly admitted Jesus as his son in the latter’s birth certificate [1]. Aurea, as legal guardian, executed an affidavit adjudicating a parcel of land left by Anastacio to the minor Jesus, resulting in the issuance of a new title in the minor's name [2-4]. Eugenio filed a complaint to annul the deed, arguing he was deprived of his rightful share [2]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissed the complaint, ruling that the illegitimate son succeeds to the entire estate to the exclusion of the brother [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the illegitimate child of the deceased excludes a collateral relative (brother) from intestate succession.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Under Article 988 of the New Civil Code, if the deceased dies intestate without legitimate descendants or ascendants, his illegitimate child shall succeed to his entire estate [6, 7]. Since Anastacio died in 1958, the New Civil Code applies [7]. The facts stipulated by the parties established that Jesus is the acknowledged illegitimate son of the deceased [7, 8]. Consequently, the illegitimate child succeeds to the exclusion of the petitioner, who is only a collateral relative [7].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED [9].
