**I. CAPTION**
ROQUE BAIRAN v. AGUSTIN TAN SIU LAY, FRANCISCO TAN, executor and HON. ANTONIO CAÑIZARES, Presiding Judge of Branch IV, Court of First Instance of Manila, G.R. No. L-19460, December 28, 1966, Dizon, J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Roque Bairan was appointed substitute attorney-in-fact by Francisco Tan to administer and sell lots in the "Mabuhay Subdivision" belonging to Tan Chiong Pun [3]. Upon Tan Chiong Pun’s death, testate proceedings were instituted, and Francisco Tan was appointed executor [4]. Respondent Agustin Tan Siu Lay, an heir, petitioned the probate court to require Bairan to post a bond, alleging Bairan was retaining collections for unauthorized expenses [4, 5].

The probate court issued two orders: (1) requiring Bairan to post a P100,000.00 surety bond [6]; and (2) requiring him to surrender possession of all estate properties to the executor [7, 8]. Bairan attempted to appeal these orders, but the respondent Judge denied the appeals, ruling that the orders were merely interlocutory and not appealable [9, 10]. Bairan filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court to set aside the orders and the Judge's refusal to give due course to his appeals [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the orders requiring the posting of a bond and the surrender of properties are final and appealable.
2. W/N the probate court committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing said orders.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the orders are final in character, not interlocutory [11]. A court order is final if it puts an end to the particular matter resolved, leaving no substantial proceeding to be had in connection therewith except its execution [11, 12]. Conversely, an order is interlocutory if it is provisional and leaves substantial proceedings to be had [11]. The order requiring a bond resolved the issue of whether Bairan must file one, leaving nothing to be done but its execution [11]. Similarly, the order to surrender properties finally determined the question of possession [13]. Therefore, both orders were appealable [11, 13].

2. **NO.** Although the respondent Judge erred in characterizing the orders as interlocutory, the Supreme Court ruled that the orders themselves were correct and within the probate court's jurisdiction [14]. Since Bairan was in possession of estate properties and collecting funds, requiring a bond and the surrender of assets to the executor was proper for the protection of the estate [14, 15]. Consequently, the Court found no grave abuse of discretion and deemed it unnecessary to issue the writs prayed for [14].

**Petition dismissed.** [16]

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro concurred with the decision [16].
