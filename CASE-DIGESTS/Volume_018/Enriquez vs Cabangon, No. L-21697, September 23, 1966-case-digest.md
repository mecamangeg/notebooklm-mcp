I. CAPTION
FRED ENRIQUEZ v. HON. DOMINGO M. CABANGON and JUAN MANALO, G.R. No. L-21697, September 23, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Juan Manalo, a tenant, filed a petition in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) against his landlord, Petitioner Fred Enriquez. Manalo sought to recover 10-1/3 cavans of palay that Enriquez had deducted from the gross produce and taken for himself. These cavans represented reaping and insecticide expenses actually defrayed by Manalo. Manalo also prayed for a change from share tenancy to leasehold tenancy. Enriquez admitted taking the palay but challenged the constitutionality of the change in tenancy system and the lack of separate notice. He also counterclaimed for the ejectment of the tenant to allow for personal cultivation by his son. The CAR ruled in favor of Manalo, ordering the return of the palay and authorizing the leasehold system. Enriquez appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the landlord may retain the palay deducted for reaping and insecticide expenses paid by the tenant.
2. W/N Section 14 of R.A. 1199 authorizing the change of tenancy system is constitutional.
3. W/N a separate notice, independent of the petition, is required to change the tenancy system.
4. W/N the landlord's counterclaim constitutes sufficient notice of dispossession for personal cultivation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 32 of the Rice Tenancy Act (R.A. 1199), as amended, expenditures for seed, fertilizer, pest/weed control, reaping, and threshing are deducted from the gross produce and "are not shared but reimbursed to the one who paid for the same" [1]. Since the CAR found that the 10-1/3 cavans covered expenses incurred by the tenant, his right to recover them from the landlord is indubitable [2].

2. **YES.** The Court held that the validity and constitutionality of Section 14 of R.A. 1199 has already been passed upon and upheld by the Supreme Court in final decisions, specifically citing *Ramos v. Court of Agrarian Relations* and *Vda. de Macasaet v. Court of Agrarian Relations* [3].

3. **NO.** Nothing in Section 14 of R.A. 1199 requires that the change of system be made by notice independent of the petition [4]. The petition itself, served on the landlord, is effective as a notification. Since the change was made effective the agricultural year following the filing of the petition, no prejudice was caused to the landlord [4].

4. **NO.** Under Section 50(a) of the Rice Tenancy Act, the landlord must file notice with the Court *and* inform the tenant in writing "at least one year prior to the date of his petition" [5]. The Court ruled that this requirement is clear; the written notice must be furnished one year ahead of the petition and cannot be merged with the petition or counterclaim itself [5].

Decision affirmed.
