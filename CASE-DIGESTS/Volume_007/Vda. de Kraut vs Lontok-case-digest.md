I. CAPTION
PILAR G. VDA. DE KRAUT v. MANUEL LONTOK, G.R. No. L-18374, February 27, 1963.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Vda. de Kraut (lessor) previously filed an unlawful detainer case against respondent Lontok (lessee). The Municipal Court ordered Lontok to vacate and pay P60.00 monthly rental (increased from the original P40.00). Lontok appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI), but the CFI eventually dismissed the *case* for failure to prosecute. Lontok resumed paying the original P40.00 rental. Subsequently, Kraut demanded the payment of P60.00 rentals. When Lontok refused, Kraut filed a new ejectment suit (Civil Case No. 40638) to recover the P20.00 difference and eject Lontok. The Municipal Court ruled for Kraut, but on appeal, the CFI dismissed the case and ordered Kraut to reimburse Lontok P1,180.00, representing the excess rental deposits (the difference between P60.00 deposited and P40.00 original rent) made during the pendency of the first case.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal of the first case by the CFI revived the Municipal Court's judgment fixing the rental at P60.00.
2. W/N the respondent is entitled to the reimbursement of excess rental deposits made during the first case.
3. W/N the petitioner has a cause of action for unlawful detainer based on the respondent's refusal to pay increased rent.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Upon the perfection of an appeal in an unlawful detainer case, the decision of the inferior court is deemed vacated and the case is to be tried *de novo* in the CFI. Since the CFI dismissed the *case itself* (and not just the appeal) for failure to prosecute, nothing remained of the original action. The parties were taken back to the situation obtaining before the case—meaning the amicable settlement of P40.00 monthly rental [1, 2].

2. **YES.** Because the parties returned to the status quo of P40.00 monthly rental after the dismissal of the first case, Lontok is entitled to recover the difference between the P60.00 he deposited and the P40.00 he was actually obligated to pay [2]. However, this entitlement ended when Kraut made a new specific demand for P60.00, which effectively terminated the old lease terms [2].

3. **YES.** A lease on a month-to-month basis may be terminated at the end of any month. The lease is deemed terminated upon the lessee's refusal to pay the increased monthly rental demanded by the lessor, provided the increase is not exorbitant [3]. The P60.00 rental was found not to be exorbitant [4].

The decision is **MODIFIED**. The case is remanded to the lower court to determine the specific date of Kraut's new demand. Lontok is entitled to reimbursement for the period prior to that date; thereafter, he is liable for the P60.00 rental [5].
