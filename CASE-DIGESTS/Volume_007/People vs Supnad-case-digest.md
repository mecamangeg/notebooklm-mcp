I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PASTOR SUPNAD, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-18747, March 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Pastor Supnad and Brigida Ungos mortgaged their house in Manila to Teresa Bautista for P2,500.00. Subsequently, knowing the property was encumbered and could not be disposed of without Bautista's consent, the accused sold the house to Damian Vasquez for P7,000.00, representing it as free from all liens [1].

The City Fiscal filed an Information for violation of Article 316, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code (Estafa). The accused moved to suspend the case, arguing a "prejudicial question" existed because a separate Civil Case found that the buyer, Vasquez, actually knew of the mortgage [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila dismissed the information, ruling that the facts did not constitute an offense. The CFI reasoned that under Art. 316, par. 2, the fraud must be practiced on the vendee; since the civil court found the vendee knew of the mortgage, and the mortgagee (Bautista) was obviously aware of the encumbrance, no deceit occurred [4, 5]. The People appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the facts alleged in the information constitute the crime of Estafa under Article 316, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code involving prejudice to the mortgagee.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the CFI erred in dismissing the case. The sufficiency of the information must be determined solely by the facts alleged therein, which clearly set forth a violation of Article 316, paragraph 2: disposing of real property knowing it to be encumbered, although such encumbrance be not recorded [6, 7]. The findings in the pending civil case regarding the buyer's knowledge do not constitute a prejudicial question but merely a defense to be substantiated during trial [7].

Contrary to the lower court's interpretation of *People v. Mariano*, the Supreme Court clarified that Estafa is committed if the party with a lien (the mortgagee) suffers damages due to the vendor's fraud [8]. In this case, fraud was practiced upon the mortgagee, Teresa Bautista, because the accused sold the property she held as security without her knowledge and consent [9].

The decision appealed from is **SET ASIDE**, and the case is **REMANDED** to the court of origin for further proceedings [10, 11].
