I. CAPTION
MALAN BROTHERS WATCHMAN AGENCY v. MAGDALENO CONANAN and THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-19019, April 29, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Conanan, a security guard employed by petitioner Malan Brothers Watchman Agency, suffered a leg injury when his service pistol accidentally discharged while on duty on November 6, 1959. He filed a compensation claim on January 6, 1960. Petitioner acknowledged receipt of the claim on April 4, 1960, but only submitted a report controverting the claim on October 3, 1960—long past the statutory period. Consequently, the Regional Administrator deemed the claim uncontroverted and issued an award of P3,371.46 to Conanan on October 12, 1960. A copy of the award was sent via registered mail to petitioner, who refused to claim it despite registry notices received on November 11 and 22, 1960. Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration on February 3, 1961, alleging the award was void for lack of hearing. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) dismissed the appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the award is void for being rendered without a formal hearing.
2. W/N the award had become final and executory when the petitioner moved for reconsideration.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A claim for compensation under Act No. 3428, as amended, is deemed admitted if not controverted within the time provided by law. Therefore, the Regional Administrator was authorized to decide the non-controverted claim based on the submission of the claim and accompanying evidence without the necessity of a formal hearing. The Court cited *Bachrach Motor Co., Inc. v. The Workmen's Compensation Commission* to support this principle.

2. **YES.** The petitioner failed to controvert the claim within the period provided in Section 45 of Act No. 3428. Furthermore, the Motion for Reconsideration was filed out of time. Service of the award is deemed complete upon the expiration of five (5) days from the date the employer received the first registry notice (November 11, 1960). Since petitioner filed the motion more than 60 days after this date, the award had already become final and the motion could no longer be entertained. The orders of the Commission are affirmed.
