I. CAPTION
GUSTAVO A. SUAREZ v. TIMBERMAN CORPORATION and the HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, G.R. Number and Date Unavailable in Source, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Gustavo A. Suarez and Respondent Timberman Corporation submitted competing bids for a timber concession in Zamboanga del Norte [1]. The Director of Forestry awarded the concession to Timberman Corporation, which was affirmed by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources [1]. Suarez appealed this decision to the President of the Philippines [1]. Pending the appeal, the Director of Forestry issued a Temporary Timber License to Timberman Corporation, contrary to the Executive Secretary's directive to hold execution in abeyance [2]. Subsequently, the President, through the Executive Secretary, reversed the Secretary's decision and awarded the concession to Suarez [2].

Timberman Corporation filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Civil Case No. 6968) against the Executive Secretary, forestry officials, and Suarez, claiming the President's decision was based on hearsay and constituted grave abuse of discretion [2]. The respondent Judge issued a writ of preliminary injunction ordering the officials to refrain from cancelling Timberman’s license and to maintain the *status quo* [2, 3]. Suarez moved to dismiss the case and lift the injunction, but the motions were denied, prompting him to file the present petition in the Supreme Court [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in taking cognizance of Civil Case No. 6968.
2. W/N the respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the writ of preliminary injunction.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the respondent Judge did not abuse his discretion in taking cognizance of the case [5]. The question of whether the Executive Secretary acted with grave abuse of discretion in overruling the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources—specifically regarding the respondent's claim that the decision was based on hearsay—should be decided after a proper hearing on the merits [6, 7]. Therefore, the interposition of judicial power to prohibit the lower court from hearing the case would be premature [7].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the issuance of the preliminary injunction constituted grave abuse of discretion and annulled the writ [5]. The decision of the President is presumed to be regular and in observance of due process until proven otherwise [6]. By issuing an injunction that maintained the *status quo*, the respondent Judge effectively extended the life of Timberman Corporation's temporary license beyond its expiration date, which is a power that belongs exclusively to the executive department [8]. The Court emphasized that findings of fact by administrative officials are binding and should not be disturbed by courts unless there is a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion, which had not yet been established in the lower court when the injunction was issued [8, 9].

The petition is **DENIED** insofar as it seeks to prohibit the lower court from taking cognizance of the case, but **GRANTED** regarding the annulment of the preliminary injunction [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
