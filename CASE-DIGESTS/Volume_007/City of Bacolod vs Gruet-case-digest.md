I. CAPTION
CITY OF BACOLOD v. LEANDRO GRUET and SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC., G.R. No. L-18290, January 31, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
The City of Bacolod (Plaintiff) assessed taxes against the Coca-Cola Plant managed by Leandro Gruet (Defendant). The plant, owned by San Miguel Brewery, Inc., was already paying a license fee of P100.00 per annum as a "manufacturer of aerated water" under Ordinance No. 48. Subsequently, the City enacted Ordinance No. 66 (Series of 1949) and Ordinance No. 150 (Series of 1959), imposing a tax of P0.03 on every case of bottled Coca-Cola manufactured by the plant. Gruet refused to pay, arguing that the ordinances constituted illegal double taxation and were ultra vires because the City lacked the authority to levy specific taxes on articles. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental ruled in favor of the City, ordering San Miguel Brewery to pay the back taxes. Gruet appealed. During the pendency of the appeal, San Miguel Brewery, Inc. voluntarily submitted itself as the real party in interest to avoid a remand.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the City of Bacolod has the authority to impose a specific tax on each case of bottled product in addition to the annual license fee.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the City of Bacolod has the authority to impose the tax. The Court ruled that previous doctrines (*Medina v. City of Baguio*, etc.) stating that cities could not tax specific articles are no longer controlling following the enactment of **Republic Act No. 2264 (Local Autonomy Act)** on June 19, 1959. Section 2 of R.A. No. 2264 expressly grants chartered cities the power not only to impose license taxes on persons engaged in business but also "otherwise to levy for public purposes, just and uniform taxes." Unlike municipalities, which are prohibited from imposing taxes on specific articles (except gasoline), the only limitation on chartered cities under R.A. 2264 regarding specific taxes is on percentage taxes on sales or taxes on gasoline. Since the tax of P0.03 per case is neither a percentage tax nor a tax on gasoline, it falls within the City's broad taxing power. Consequently, there is no illegal double taxation as the P100 fee is on the business license, while the P0.03 tax is on the finished product. The decision appealed from is affirmed.
