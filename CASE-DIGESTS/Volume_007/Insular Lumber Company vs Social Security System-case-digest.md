**I. CAPTION**
INSULAR LUMBER COMPANY v. SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-17625, January 31, 1963, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Insular Lumber Company became a compulsory member of the Social Security System (SSS) in August 1957. Its employee, Pedro Primavera, was on sick leave with pay until September 1957, after which he went on leave without pay having exhausted his sickness benefits [1]. The SSS initially advised Petitioner that it was not liable for the 3.5% employer contribution for the month Primavera was on leave without pay [2]. However, the SSS subsequently issued a bill demanding P3.48 representing the employer's share of the premium for September 1957 [3]. Petitioner contested this, arguing Primavera had no earnings that month, but the SSS ruled that the obligation to remit contributions exists as long as the employer-employee relationship is not terminated [3]. Petitioner filed a petition with the Social Security Commission to annul this ruling, which was denied [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N an employer is liable to pay its share of SSS premiums for a covered employee who is on leave without pay.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** Payment of SSS contributions is compulsory during coverage, which is determined solely by the existence of an employer-employee relationship pursuant to Section 9 of the Social Security Act [5, 6]. Even when an employee is on leave without pay, the employment contract is not terminated, and the employer-employee relationship remains intact [5]. Consequently, the employee is still entitled to System benefits and is liable for premiums upon return, and the employer remains liable for its contribution [6]. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Elizalde Rope Factory, Inc. v. Social Security Commission* (G.R. No. L-15163), holding that contributions are not based on compensation actually earned but on the continued existence of employment [4, 7]. Unlike the U.S. system where contributions are treated as taxes on wages, the Philippine system treats them as premiums collectible even when wages are not actually paid [8].

The resolutions appealed from are AFFIRMED, with costs [9].
