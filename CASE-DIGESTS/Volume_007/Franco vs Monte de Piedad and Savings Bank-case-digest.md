I. CAPTION
**JESUS R. FRANCO and NATIVIDAD C. TORRES v. MONTE DE PIEDAD AND SAVINGS BANK**, [G.R. Number and Date not indicated in source], **Reyes, J.B.L., J.**

II. FACTS
Spouses Jesus R. Franco and Natividad C. Torres (Spouses) obtained a P15,000.00 loan from Monte de Piedad & Savings Bank (Bank) secured by a mortgage on four parcels of land [1]. After failing to pay any amortization, the Spouses executed a deed of assignment ceding the properties to the Bank in payment of the debt, with a right to redeem within one year [1]. The Spouses redeemed one property but failed to redeem the remaining properties despite extensions granted by the Bank [1].

The Bank subsequently petitioned the Court of First Instance of Quezon City, acting as a Land Registration Court (G.L.R.O. Rec. No. 3563), to consolidate ownership and cancel the Spouses' titles [2]. The Spouses opposed the petition, arguing the assignment was a void *pactum commissorium*, but the court overruled their objection and ordered the titles cancelled and new ones issued to the Bank [2]. This order became final [3].

Before the Land Registration Court's order became final, the Spouses filed the present civil action (Civil Case No. Q-5009) in the Court of First Instance of Rizal for "reformation," claiming the assignment was merely an equitable mortgage [3, 4]. The Bank moved to dismiss on the ground of *res judicata* [4]. The lower court dismissed the complaint, and the Spouses appealed, arguing that the Land Registration Court had limited jurisdiction and could not have validly decided the issue of equitable mortgage, meaning *res judicata* should not apply [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the present action for reformation is barred by the prior judgment of the Land Registration Court under the doctrine of *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal, ruling that the action is barred by the prior judgment [7, 8].

The Court held that a prior decision is conclusive in a second suit between the same parties, on the same subject matter, and on the same cause of action, covering matters expressly adjudged and those that could have been properly set up [7]. Both the Land Registration case and the present civil action involved the identical issue of whether the deed of assignment was valid or merely an equitable mortgage [7].

Regarding the Spouses' argument on jurisdiction, the Court ruled that while a Land Registration Court generally has no power to decide issues litigable in ordinary civil actions, an exception exists where the parties have acquiesced in submitting the issues for determination in the registration proceedings and were given full opportunity to present their evidence [9, 10]. Since the Spouses voluntarily submitted the issue of the deed's validity to the Land Registration Court, they are concluded by its final judgment [11]. The Court further noted that the Spouses' claim that the assignment was intended as a "second mortgage" was absurd, as the Bank already held a prior mortgage on the same properties [11].

**Disposition:** The appealed order of the dismissal is hereby affirmed. Costs against appellants [8].
