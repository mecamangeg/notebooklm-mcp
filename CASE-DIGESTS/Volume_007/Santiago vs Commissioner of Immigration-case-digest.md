I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR CANCELLATION OF ALIEN CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION, RICARDO SANTIAGO v. COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION**, G.R. No. L-14653, January 31, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On June 15, 1957, Ricardo Santiago filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental seeking to be declared a Philippine citizen and to cancel his Alien Certificate of Registration (ACR), claiming it was erroneously entered [1]. He alleged he was born illegitimate to a Filipina mother and a Chinese father [2]. Later, Santiago amended his petition to remove the specific prayer for a declaration of citizenship, asking only for the cancellation of his ACR [3]. The lower court granted the petition and ordered the Commissioner of Immigration to cancel Santiago's ACR, effectively ruling he was a Filipino citizen [4, 5]. The Commissioner of Immigration appealed, arguing that the petition was essentially one for declaratory relief regarding citizenship, which is not a procedural remedy recognized in the Philippines [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for the cancellation of an Alien Certificate of Registration is a proper remedy to seek a judicial declaration of Philippine citizenship.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that although the amended petition did not explicitly ask for a declaration of Filipino citizenship, the plea was implicit in the prayer for the cancellation of the ACR, as the cancellation could not be based on any ground other than the petitioner's claim to being a Filipino citizen [6, 7]. Therefore, the suit was, in effect, an action for declaratory relief regarding citizenship [8, 9].

The Court applied the settled doctrine that there is no proceeding established by law, whether by declaratory relief or otherwise, available for the express purpose of obtaining a judicial declaration of citizenship [8, 10]. Citing *Tan v. Republic* and *Obiles v. Republic*, the Court emphasized that while citizenship may be determined as a necessary premise for other reliefs (e.g., deportation proceedings or naturalization), there is no legislation authorizing a judicial proceeding solely to declare a person's citizenship status [10, 11]. Since the remedy sought was improper, the Court did not find it necessary to examine the evidence regarding Santiago's citizenship [12].

The order appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DISMISSED** [12].
