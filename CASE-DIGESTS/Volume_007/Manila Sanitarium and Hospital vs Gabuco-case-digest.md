I. CAPTION
MANILA SANITARIUM & HOSPITAL and/or H.L. DYER v. FAUSTO GABUCO and the COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-14311, January 31, 1963, Paredes, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Respondent Fausto Gabuco filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) against petitioner Manila Sanitarium & Hospital (the Hospital) with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). Gabuco alleged he was dismissed on September 30, 1956, for organizing a union [2, 3]. The Hospital moved to dismiss the case, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction because the Hospital is a charitable and educational institution not established for profit or gain [4].

The CIR denied the motion and ruled in favor of Gabuco, ordering his reinstatement. The CIR held that the Hospital was operated for profit because it charged medical fees and did not maintain a distinct "Free Ward," unlike other charitable organizations like the Boy Scouts [5, 6]. The Hospital appealed, maintaining it is a non-profit religious and educational entity [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over Manila Sanitarium and Hospital. [4, 7]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CIR decision, ruling that the Hospital is a purely charitable and educational institution not established for profit, and thus not governed by Commonwealth Act No. 103 (Industrial Peace Act) [9, 10].

The Court held that the mere charging of medical fees does not make a hospital one established for profit, as it must meet operating expenses to serve its lofty purposes (*U.S.T. Hospital Employees v. Santo Tomas Hospital*) [1, 11]. Furthermore, the absence of a designated "Free Ward" does not prove the Hospital fails to give free assistance; evidence showed indigent patients were treated alongside paying patients and the Hospital spent significantly on free services [11-13]. Finally, the fact that a charitable institution does not incur losses or gains from operations does not convert it into a business enterprise, especially where, as here, no dividends were declared to members and funds were used solely for the institution's objectives [12, 14].

Petition granted; the decision of the CIR is reversed [15].
