I. CAPTION
THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF ILOILO v. C. N. HODGES, G.R. No. L-18178, January 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Fermin Jalover, owner of Lot No. 986 (TCT No. T-2125), mortgaged the property to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC) on March 25, 1953, to secure a loan of P6,500.00. Subsequently, on May 31, 1957, the lot was sold at public auction to C.N. Hodges to satisfy judgments in two civil cases. These sales were annotated on TCT No. T-2125 as Entries Nos. 15102 and 15104.

On March 14, 1960, Jalover requested the Register of Deeds to cancel these entries, claiming they were void under Section 26 of Commonwealth Act No. 459, which allegedly exempted the property from attachment. The Register of Deeds denied the request but, upon direction from the Land Registration Commissioner, filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Iloilo under Section 112 of Act 496 (Land Registration Act) for cancellation. Hodges opposed the petition, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction as a land registration court due to the controversial nature of the case, and that the exemption under C.A. No. 459 did not apply to RFC loans. The lower court assumed jurisdiction and ordered the cancellation. Hodges appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance, acting as a land registration court, had jurisdiction to order the cancellation of the entries given the opposition.
2. W/N the property mortgaged to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation is exempt from attachment under Commonwealth Act No. 459.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court of First Instance acts with limited jurisdiction as a land registration court. Under Section 112 of Act 496, relief for the erasure or alteration of a certificate of title can only be granted if there is unanimity among the parties or if there is no adverse claim or serious objection. Since Hodges seriously opposed the petition and raised a substantial legal issue regarding the validity of the exemption, the case became controversial. Such issues must be litigated in an ordinary action, not in a summary proceeding under Section 112 [1]. The Court cited *Tangunan v. Republic* and *Government of the Philippine Islands v. Jalandoni* in support of this principle.

2. **NO.** Section 26 of Commonwealth Act No. 459 provides an exemption from attachment for properties mortgaged to the Agricultural and Industrial Bank. However, the subject property was mortgaged to the RFC to secure a loan obtained directly from it. Republic Act No. 85, which created the RFC, does not contain a similar exemption provision for loans obtained from the RFC [2]. The transitory provisions of Section 9 of R.A. No. 85 apply only to old transactions contracted with the defunct Agricultural and Industrial Bank, which the RFC merely administers as a trustee, and not to new loans contracted with the RFC [3].

Accordingly, the order appealed from is reversed.
