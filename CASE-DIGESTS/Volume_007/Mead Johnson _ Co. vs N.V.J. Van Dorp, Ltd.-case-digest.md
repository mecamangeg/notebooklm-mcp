I. CAPTION
MEAD JOHNSON AND COMPANY v. N. V. J. VAN DORP, LTD., ET AL., G.R. No. L-17501, April 27, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent N. V. J. Van Dorp, Ltd., a Netherlands corporation, filed an application for the registration of the trademark "ALASKA and pictorial representation of a Boy’s Head" for milk and dairy products [1]. Petitioner Mead Johnson & Company, owner of the registered trademark "ALACTA" used for powdered half-skim milk, opposed the application on the ground of confusing similarity [2]. Petitioner argued that the marks are similar in sound and appearance, sharing the same number of letters and identical vowels [3]. Respondent countered that the products fall under different classifications—"ALASKA" under Foods (Class 47) and "ALACTA" under Medicines and Pharmaceutical Preparations (Class 6)—and that the marks should be viewed in their entirety [4, 5]. The Director of the Patent Office dismissed the opposition, ruling that the marks were not likely to cause confusion [4]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trademark "ALASKA" is confusingly similar to "ALACTA" such that it would deceive purchasers.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the decision of the Director of the Patent Office. While the two marks have similarities in spelling, sound, and structure (both having six letters and three syllables), the test for confusing similarity requires that the trademarks be considered in their entirety as they appear on their respective labels and in relation to the goods to which they are attached [7].

The Court found striking dissimilarities that outweighed the resemblances:
1.  **Packaging:** Petitioner's "ALACTA" comes in one-pound containers with light blue or pink/white backgrounds, while Respondent's "ALASKA" comes in various tin sizes with yellowish-white and red bands [8].
2.  **Typography:** "ALACTA" is written with only the first letter capitalized in black, whereas "ALASKA" is written in all caps in white or red [9].
3.  **Nature of Goods:** "ALACTA" covers pharmaceutical preparations for nutritional needs (Class 6) typically prescribed by physicians, while "ALASKA" covers milk and food ingredients (Class 47) which do not require prescriptions [9].

The Court held that the "discerning eye of the observer must focus not only on the predominant words but also on the other features appearing on both labels" [10]. Consequently, the decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**, with costs against petitioner [11].
