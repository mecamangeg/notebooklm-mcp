I. CAPTION
**MATA v. RITA LEGARDA, INC.**, G.R. No. L-18941, January 31, 1963 [1]. (Ponente not indicated in source).

II. FACTS
The case involves an action to compel the execution of a deed of absolute sale [2]. The defendant corporation was represented by counsel. During the proceedings, the notice of hearing was served upon an employee of the defendant corporation rather than the defendant's attorney of record [2]. The issue arose as to whether this service was valid and binding on the defendant.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the notice of hearing served upon an employee of the defendant corporation binds the attorney of record or the client.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the notice of hearing served upon an employee of the defendant corporation did not bind the attorney of record nor his client [2]. The Court applied the general rule that where a party appears by attorney in an action or proceeding, all notices required by law must be given to the attorney and not to the client [3]. Service upon the party or an employee is not considered notice in law once the party has appeared by counsel [3].
