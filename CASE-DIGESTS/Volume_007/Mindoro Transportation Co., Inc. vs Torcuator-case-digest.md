I. CAPTION
MINDORO TRANSPORTATION CO., INC. v. JOSE T. TORCUATOR, G.R. No. L-18479, February 28, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Jose T. Torcuator applied for a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) with the Public Service Commission (PSC) to operate 25 auto-trucks on five routes in Oriental Mindoro. Petitioner Mindoro Transportation Co., Inc. opposed the application, alleging that Torcuator was financially incapable of maintaining the service and that the existing service was already adequate.

During the proceedings, Torcuator presented five witnesses who testified to the lack of direct bus services, the prevalence of "colorum" jitneys, and the difficulties passengers faced on the proposed routes. Torcuator also testified regarding his financial capacity, establishing ownership of trucks ready for operation or assembly, cash on hand, a credit line, and income from his law practice. The petitioner presented only one witness, its own traffic manager, to disprove these claims.

The PSC granted the application for six buses covering three routes (San Agustin-Calapan Pier, Victoria-Calapan Pier, and Apiton-Calapan Pier), subject to the condition that the units be registered in the applicant's name within 30 days. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the sufficiency of evidence regarding public necessity and the applicant's financial capacity, specifically noting the non-presentation of deeds of sale for the trucks.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the PSC erred in finding a public necessity for the proposed service based on the evidence presented.
2. W/N the non-presentation of the deeds of sale for the trucks rendered the applicant financially incapable or the application fatal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court found that the PSC correctly appreciated the evidence. The unimpeached testimonies of the applicant's five witnesses were properly given more weight than the testimony of the oppositor's single witness, whose bias as the company's traffic manager was apparent [1, 2]. The Court reiterated the principle that findings of the PSC regarding public necessity and convenience are findings of fact that should not be interfered with when reasonably supported by evidence [3].

2. **NO.** The non-presentation of the deeds of sale was not fatal to the application. The PSC is not bound by the technical rules of evidence under Section 29 of Commonwealth Act No. 146 [4, 5]. Furthermore, the PSC decision expressly made the registration of the buses in the applicant's name a condition precedent for the certificate; unless such registration is made, the applicant is not entitled to operate [5]. The Court affirmed that the applicant had established sufficient financial capacity through his testimony regarding his assets and income [2].

The decision of the Public Service Commission is AFFIRMED.
