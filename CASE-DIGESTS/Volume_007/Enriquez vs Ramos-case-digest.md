**I. CAPTION**
RODRIGO ENRIQUEZ, ET AL. v. SOCORRO A. RAMOS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16797, February 27, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
On November 24, 1958, Rodrigo Enriquez and Spouses Dizon sold 11 parcels of land in Quezon City to Socorro Ramos for P101,000 [1]. Ramos paid P5,000 down (P2,500 in cash and P2,500 by check) and agreed to pay the P96,000 balance within 90 days, secured by a mortgage on the sold properties and an additional lot [1]. Ramos stopped payment on the P2,500 check, prompting plaintiffs to file a suit for its recovery in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila on February 24, 1959 [2, 3]. Later, Ramos failed to pay the P96,000 balance, leading plaintiffs to file a separate foreclosure action in CFI Quezon City on April 29, 1959 [2]. Ramos moved to dismiss, arguing that the first suit barred the second due to splitting a single cause of action under Rule 2, Section 4 [2]. The lower court denied the motion and ruled in favor of plaintiffs [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the foreclosure action is barred by the prior suit for the check due to splitting of a single cause of action.
2. W/N the court must fix a period for the obligation before ordering payment or foreclosure.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the two actions are distinct and Rule 2, Section 4 does not apply [3]. The first suit in Manila was based on the unlawful stopping of payment of the check, which was a distinct debt not covered by the security [3]. The second suit was for the non-payment of the P96,000 balance guaranteed by the mortgage [3]. Additionally, since the mortgaged lands were in Quezon City, the plaintiffs could not have asked for foreclosure in the Manila courts [3].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the stipulation "payable within ninety (90) days from this date" clearly fixed a maturity date [4]. The provision stating the obligation would bear 12% interest in case of default was merely a penalty clause designed to induce payment on time, not an indication that no period was fixed [4]. Therefore, there was no need for the court to set a new due date [4].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [5].
