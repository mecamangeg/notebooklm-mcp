I. CAPTION
GENARO NATAÑO v. HON. JOSE L. MOYA and SILVERIO BALANLAYOS, G.R. No. L-16869, March 30, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Following the November 10, 1959 general elections in Del Gallego, Camarines Sur, the Municipal Board of Canvassers (MBC) discovered that the election return for Precinct No. 8-A omitted the name and votes of candidate Silverio Balanlayos [1, 2]. However, the Election Result form submitted to the Municipal Treasurer showed Balanlayos received 99 votes [3]. On November 12, the MBC proclaimed Genaro Nataño as the 6th councilor "under protest" due to this discrepancy [2, 3]. On November 16, the MBC passed Resolution No. 1, recognizing Balanlayos's votes and proclaiming him the 4th councilor, effectively displacing Nataño [4, 5].

Balanlayos filed a petition (Election Case No. 4754) with the Court of First Instance (CFI) to annul Nataño’s proclamation and validate Resolution No. 1 or open the ballot boxes to verify the votes [5, 6]. Nataño filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the proper remedy was an election protest under Section 174 of the Revised Election Code. The CFI, presided by Judge Moya, denied the motion [7]. Nataño filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the controversy regarding the discrepancy between the election return and the board of inspectors' report falls under Sections 168 and 163 of the Revised Election Code rather than an election protest under Section 174.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the controversy falls under the provisions of **Section 168 in connection with Section 163 of the Revised Election Code**, and not under Section 174 [8, 9].

The Court reasoned that Nataño's proclamation as the sixth councilor was disputed ("under protest") and there was a clear discrepancy between the election return (where Balanlayos's name and votes were omitted) and the report of the precinct board of inspectors submitted to the municipal treasurer [10]. Under these circumstances, the proper remedy is the summary judicial recount or correction provided in Sections 163 and 168, aimed at delaying as little as practicable the proclamation of the winning candidate, rather than a full election protest [10, 11].

The petition for certiorari is denied and the preliminary injunction is dissolved [9].
