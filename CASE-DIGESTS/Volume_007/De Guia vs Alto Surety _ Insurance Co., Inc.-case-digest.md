I. CAPTION
JULIA A. DE GUIA, ET AL. v. ALTO SURETY & INSURANCE CO., INC., G.R. No. L-18646, February 28, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs De Guia filed a replevin case against the Alejos in the Justice of the Peace Court, which was appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal (Civil Case No. 4109) [1]. Defendant Alto Surety posted a bond for the Alejos [2]. The CFI affirmed the judgment ordering the Alejos to deliver a refrigerator to plaintiffs [1, 3]. When the writ of execution was returned unsatisfied because the Alejos could not be located, plaintiffs moved to execute the bond against Alto Surety in the same case [1]. The CFI denied the motion because the judgment did not state the property's value nor direct payment in case of failure to deliver [1, 4]. Instead of appealing this order, plaintiffs filed a separate action for specific performance against Alto Surety in the Municipal Court of Manila [4]. The Municipal Court and later the CFI of Manila ruled in favor of plaintiffs, ordering Alto Surety to deliver the refrigerator or pay P330.00 [4, 5]. Alto Surety appealed, arguing the separate action was barred by the Rules of Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a separate action can be instituted to hold a surety liable on a replevin bond after the judgment in the main case has become final.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that Section 10 of Rule 62, in relation to Section 20 of Rule 59 of the Rules of Court, is mandatory [6, 7]. To hold a surety liable, the application against the bond must be made after hearing and before the entry of final judgment in the main case [6, 7]. If the judgment under execution contains no directive for the surety to pay, and the party fails to claim such directive before the judgment becomes final, the surety cannot be held liable later [7]. A separate action cannot be instituted because it would result in the impermissible alteration or modification of the final judgment in the main case [8, 9]. The purpose of these rules is to avoid multiplicity of suits [7].

The decision appealed from is hereby reversed and set aside [10].
