I. CAPTION
JOSE B. ESCUETA v. THE CITY MAYOR, THE CITY TREASURER, THE MARKET MASTER and THE MUNICIPAL BOARD, all of Pasay City, G.R. No. L-18481, April 30, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On July 8, 1949, petitioner Jose B. Escueta was appointed by the Secretary of Finance as a member of the Market Committee of Pasay City representing market vendors, pursuant to Department Orders issued under Republic Act No. 37 [1, 2]. In 1958, the Municipal Board of Pasay enacted Ordinance No. 120, seeking to create a different committee and excluding petitioner [2]. Respondents (City Mayor, et al.) refused to recognize Escueta, arguing he was not a market vendor and recognized one Valeriano Pestanas as the vendors' representative instead [3, 4]. Escueta filed an original action for prohibition and mandamus with preliminary injunction before the Supreme Court to restrain respondents from excluding him and from adjudicating market stalls without his participation [1, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioner still holds the office of member of the Market Committee.
2. W/N the petitioner is disqualified from the office for not being a market vendor.
3. W/N the validity of petitioner's title to the office can be questioned in this proceeding.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the petitioner's office has no fixed term. Inasmuch as he has not resigned, and the position has not been extinguished by abandonment, removal, or appointment of a successor, he remains the lawful incumbent entitled to discharge his duties [6, 7].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that Department Order No. 32 and Department Order No. 42, under which the committee was created, do not require one to be a market vendor to qualify for appointment as the representative of the market vendors [8, 9].

3. **NO.** The Court applied the principle that the title of a holder of an appointive office, even if he were merely a *de facto* officer, cannot be questioned collaterally. It may only be questioned in *quo warranto* proceedings instituted by the person claiming the office or by the Republic (Solicitor General or fiscal) under Rule 68 of the Rules of Court [8, 9].

The petition was **GRANTED** [10].
