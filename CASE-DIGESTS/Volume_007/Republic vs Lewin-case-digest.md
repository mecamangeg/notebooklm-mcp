I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. THEODORE (TED) LEWIN, G.R. No. L-17173, April 30, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On February 27, 1954, Theodore Lewin filed his 1953 income tax return, declaring a tax due of P11,870.00. An assessment notice was sent to the address indicated in his return, "Bayview Hotel, Manila." His counsel acknowledged receipt of the notice by Mrs. Lewin but informed the Collector of Internal Revenue that Lewin was in New York and would settle the obligation upon his return. Subsequently, a deficiency assessment for P6,834.00 was issued and received by Lewin's counsel on March 13, 1958.

Due to non-payment, the Republic filed a collection suit on February 18, 1959. During the pendency of the case, Lewin paid the principal tax amounts but refused to pay the surcharges and interest. The Court of First Instance of Manila rendered judgment ordering Lewin to pay P9,184.73 representing the 5% surcharge and 1% monthly interest. Lewin appealed, arguing he was not in default as he was not duly notified of the assessments while he was in the United States [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Lewin is liable for the surcharge and interest on his income tax deficiency despite his absence from the Philippines when the assessment notices were served.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court. The Court held that assessment notices sent to the address provided by the taxpayer in his income tax return are binding upon him. In this case, the receipt of the notices was acknowledged by Lewin's representative in the Philippines. Furthermore, the Court noted that Lewin's absence from the country did not render the requisite payments impossible [4].

Consequently, the decision appealed from was affirmed, with costs against the defendant-appellant [5].
