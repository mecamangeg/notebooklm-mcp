I. CAPTION
FRANKLIN BAKER COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-17361, April 29, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Franklin Baker Company temporarily ceased operations from December 1957 to February 1958 due to machinery overhauling and lack of orders [1]. Its employee, Tomas Zamora, rendered no service during this period and subsequently went on sick leave without pay from March 9, 1958, until his death on June 13, 1958 [1]. Upon the filing of a death claim, the Social Security System (Respondent) found that no premium remittances were made for February, March, and June 1958, and billed Petitioner for its employer share amounting to P8.18 [2]. The Social Security Commission (SSC) upheld the billing, relying on a resolution stating that employers remain liable for their 3.5% share as long as the employer-employee relationship exists, even if no premiums are remitted [3]. Petitioner moved for reconsideration, arguing it should not be liable when the employee receives no compensation, but the SSC denied the motion [3, 4]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the employer is liable for its share of SSS premiums while an employee is on leave without pay.
2. W/N the "theoretical salary" basis for computing contributions is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the employer's obligation to contribute its share to the System is effective during the existence of the employer-employee relationship [6]. Under Section 9 of the Social Security Act, coverage is determined solely by the existence of this relationship [7]. An employee on leave without pay is still an employee; the employment contract is not terminated, and the employer is bound to accept them back upon return [7]. Therefore, pursuant to Section 19 of the Act, the employer must pay contributions "every month thereafter during his employment," regardless of whether the employee is actually receiving compensation at that time [8, 9].

2. **YES.** Since the obligation to contribute does not cease during wageless months, a reasonable basis for computing the contribution amount must be adopted [9]. The SSC's policy of using a "theoretical salary"—based on the salary of the month preceding the wageless month or the daily rate multiplied by the number of working days—is reasonable on both legal and actuarial grounds [9, 10]. This policy is a valid implementation of the existing statute, not judicial legislation, and is consistent with the rule that the Social Security Act must be liberally construed in favor of those seeking its benefits [5, 9].

The resolution of the Social Security Commission is affirmed [11].
