I. CAPTION
FLASH TAXICAB CO., INC. v. ALBERTO CRUZ and PHILIPPINE BANK OF COMMERCE, G.R. Nos. L-15464 and L-16255, March 30, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Flash Taxicab Co. held a certificate of public convenience (CPC) for 20 taxicabs. The CPC was sold at a public auction to respondent Philippine Bank of Commerce, which then sold it to respondent Alberto Cruz. Based on these transfers, the Public Service Commission (PSC) withdrew Petitioner's authority and granted Cruz provisional authority to operate, without giving Petitioner prior notice.

Subsequently, the Court of First Instance annulled the sheriff's auction sale. Consequently, the PSC revoked Cruz's provisional authority. However, upon resolving the parties' subsequent motions, the PSC issued an order allowing Cruz to continue operating. The PSC justified this by finding that Petitioner had failed to register or operate any taxicab units even during the period after Cruz's authority was withdrawn, implying abandonment of service. Petitioner appealed, questioning the factual findings and the initial lack of notice.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court can review the Public Service Commission's factual finding regarding Petitioner's failure to operate.
2. W/N the Petitioner was denied due process when the PSC cancelled its certificate without prior notice or hearing.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court is not at liberty to disturb the findings of fact of the Public Service Commission unless they are not clearly and sufficiently supported by the evidence [1]. The Commission found that Petitioner failed to register or operate any taxicabs even after the provisional authority granted to Cruz was withdrawn [2]. This finding is binding and supports the conclusion that Cruz has a clearer right to operate the service [3].

2. **NO.** While the Public Service Act generally requires notice and hearing before the suspension or revocation of a certificate, the lack thereof is a defect that can be cured. Citing *Borja v. Flores* (62 Phil. 106), the Court ruled that the defect of lack of notice is cured if the affected party is subsequently heard on a motion for reconsideration [4]. In this case, Petitioner was able to file a motion for reconsideration and was duly heard by the Commission, raising all its defenses [5].

The petition is dismissed and the PSC orders are affirmed.
