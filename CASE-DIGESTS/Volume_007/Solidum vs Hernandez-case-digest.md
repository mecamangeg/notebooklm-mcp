I. CAPTION
ARSENIO SOLIDUM and HERMOGENES CONCEPCION, JR. v. JAIME HERNANDEZ, G.R. No. L-16570, February 28, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Jaime Hernandez, the Secretary of Finance, was charged in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, presided by Petitioner Judge Arsenio Solidum, with violation of Article 216 of the Revised Penal Code [1]. The amended information alleged that Hernandez, while owning shares in Avegon Construction and Electrical Co., Inc., granted the corporation tax exemptions and dollar allocations in his official capacity [2]. Hernandez filed a motion to quash, arguing that the facts charged did not constitute an offense and that Article 216 does not apply to Department Heads under the Constitution [3].

Judge Solidum denied the motion to quash, ruling that the fundamental questions raised regarding the applicability of the law could not be decided properly without the presentation of evidence [4]. Hernandez then filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus with the Court of Appeals, alleging grave abuse of discretion [5]. The Court of Appeals issued a writ of prohibition against Judge Solidum [6]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the writ of prohibition lies against the trial court's denial of the motion to quash.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeals erred in issuing the writ of prohibition [7]. Under Section 2, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, writs of prohibition are allowed only upon a showing of lack or excess of jurisdiction, or grave abuse of discretion [7, 8]. Grave abuse of discretion requires a "capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment" equivalent to a lack of jurisdiction [9]. The Court found that Judge Solidum did not abuse his discretion but rather exercised a "deep sense of justice" by ruling that the complex issues raised required evidence [10].

Furthermore, prohibition is available only when there is no other remedy sufficient to afford redress [11, 12]. The Court affirmed that the proper remedy for the respondent was to proceed to trial and, if necessary, appeal the decision in due time [12].

The writ of prohibition issued by the Court of Appeals is lifted, and the case is remanded to the lower court for the continuance of proceedings [13].
