I. CAPTION
SY HA *alias* SZE SOOK HA, ET AL. v. EMILIO L. GALANG, G.R. No. L-18513, April 27, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Sy Ha and her two minor children, Chinese citizens, arrived in the Philippines as temporary visitors on June 26, 1960. On July 20, 1960, Sy Ha married Go Hip, a Filipino citizen, in Manila. They requested the cancellation of their alien registry, claiming status as the wife and children of a Filipino. Associate Commissioner Talabis granted this request on July 26, 1960. However, Respondent Commissioner of Immigration Galang revoked this order on December 1, 1960, after finding that Sy Ha's visa application listed her husband as a "Go Hip" residing in Hong Kong, leading Galang to conclude her marriage in Manila was void *ab initio* due to a subsisting prior marriage.

Petitioners filed a petition for mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to compel the recognition of their citizenship. The CFI initially dismissed the petition. Petitioners then moved for a new trial, offering "newly discovered evidence" (re-entry permits, blood tests, and testimonies) to prove the identity of Go Hip. The CFI granted the new trial and rendered an amended decision declaring petitioners Filipino citizens and ordering Respondent to recognize the Talabis order. Respondent appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court properly granted a new trial based on the alleged newly discovered evidence.
2. W/N mandamus lies to compel the Commissioner of Immigration to recognize the petitioners as citizens based on the Associate Commissioner's previous order.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the evidence presented (documentary and testimonial) did not partake of the nature of newly discovered evidence because it was already in existence and known to the petitioners at the time of the administrative investigation and the original trial [1, 2]. Forgotten evidence or evidence which was not offered through oversight or intentional omission cannot be presented as newly discovered evidence to support a motion for new trial [2].

2. **NO.** Mandamus lies only to compel the performance of a ministerial duty, not a discretionary one [3]. The determination of whether an applicant constitutes a non-immigrant or is entitled to enter involves the exercise of discretion and judgment, which cannot be controlled by mandamus [3]. Furthermore, it was improvident for the trial court to overrule the Commissioner's decision based on evidence (from the new trial) that the Commissioner was never given the opportunity to examine or evaluate [4, 5].

The decision appealed from is REVERSED and the petition for mandamus is DISMISSED [6].
