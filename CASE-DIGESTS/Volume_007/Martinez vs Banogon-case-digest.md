I. CAPTION
**IN RE WILL OF ALEJANDRO SOMOZA, LEONARDO P. MARTINEZ v. ALICIA S. BANOGON, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-15698, April 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Atty. Leonardo P. Martinez served as counsel for the probate of the will and administration of the estate of the deceased Alejandro Somoza starting February 1, 1946 [1]. After rendering services for several years, on November 19, 1956, Martinez entered into a written contract for professional services with the heirs, stipulating a fee of P800.00 for handling the administration case (Special Case No. 476) [1, 2].

Martinez received a total of P1,320.00 (the P800.00 stipulated fee plus P520.00 for incidental services) [3, 4]. On March 5, 1957, claiming the contract was not binding because the heirs lacked authority from the former administrator, Martinez filed a petition demanding P6,000.00 as the reasonable value of his services [3]. The Court of First Instance denied the petition, ruling that the written contract controlled and the amount received was reasonable for the nature of work performed [4]. Martinez appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court on questions of law [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Atty. Martinez is entitled to additional attorney's fees beyond the amount stipulated in the written contract.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's resolution. Under Section 22, Rule 127 of the Rules of Court (at the time), a written contract for professional services controls the amount to be paid unless found by the court to be unconscionable or unreasonable [4, 5].

Applying the factors for determining compensation set in *Delgado v. De la Rama* (43 Phil. 419)—such as the labor involved, importance of litigation, and professional standing—the Court found the stipulated fee reasonable [6, 7]. As a lawyer of long experience, Martinez is presumed to have "sized up the entire situation" before entering the contract [8, 9]. The fact that he had already rendered services for 11 years prior to the contract is immaterial, as time employed is not an appropriate basis for fixing compensation (*De Guzman v. Visayan Transit Co.*, 68 Phil. 643) [8, 9].

The resolution appealed from is affirmed [10].
