I. CAPTION
**LEOPOLDO SALCEDO v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS and REMEDIOS V. RODRIGUEZ**, G.R. No. L-18480, January 31, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
In January 1956, respondent Rodriguez filed a complaint against petitioner Salcedo in the CFI of Quezon for recognition of her child and support. Summons was served on Salcedo’s housemaid. Salcedo failed to answer, was declared in default, and a judgment was rendered against him on November 27, 1956.

On February 24, 1958, after being served a writ of execution, Salcedo filed a motion to set aside the judgment, questioning the service of summons. The trial court denied this motion and a subsequent motion for reconsideration in 1958; Salcedo did not appeal these orders. On May 4, 1959, Salcedo filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA) again questioning the jurisdiction and service of summons. The CA dismissed the petition, and the dismissal became final as no review was sought.

Salcedo then filed a notice of appeal from the decision on the merits with the trial court and moved for an extension of time to file the record on appeal. The trial court denied the motion and dismissed the appeal. Salcedo filed a petition for mandamus with the CA to compel the approval of the record on appeal, which the CA dismissed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the petition for mandamus to compel the trial court to give due course to the belated appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the mandamus petition. The Court held that the question regarding the validity of the service of summons—the basis for Salcedo's claim that the judgment was void—had already been raised in his motions for reconsideration and relief filed in 1958. Since Salcedo failed to appeal the orders denying those motions, they became final. Additionally, the issue was raised and rejected in his previous petition for certiorari before the CA, which also became final. Because the judgment and orders had long become final, the trial court committed no error in denying the belated motion to present a record on appeal. Mandamus will not lie to compel the court to give due course to an appeal when the judgment has already attained finality [1, 2].

Petition dismissed; decision affirmed.
