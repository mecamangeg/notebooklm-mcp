I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RICARDO RAMOS, THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK and THE REGISTRAR OF DEEDS IN AND FOR THE PROVINCE OF ISABELA, G.R. No. L-15484, January 31, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On September 20, 1947, Ricardo Ramos filed a homestead application for 9.2820 hectares of land in San Mateo, Isabela. In his application, he stated under oath that he had not previously filed any homestead application or held any homestead patent. The application was approved, and Patent No. V-62617 and OCT No. R-5169 were issued in 1955. Ramos subsequently mortgaged the land to the Philippine National Bank (PNB).

Later, residents of San Mateo petitioned to cancel Ramos' patent, discovering that Ramos had already secured a homestead patent for 3.1730 hectares in Nueva Ecija in 1949. The Republic filed an action for nullity of the Isabela patent and title, asserting violation of Section 19 of Commonwealth Act (C.A.) No. 141, as amended by C.A. No. 456, and alleged fraud due to Ramos' false statement.

Ramos and PNB moved to dismiss. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Isabela dismissed the complaint, ruling that: (1) the action was barred by indefeasibility of title after one year; (2) there was no allegation of willful fraud; and (3) C.A. No. 456 is unconstitutional because it limits homesteads to one entry, violating Article XIII, Section 2 of the Constitution which sets a 24-hectare limit. The Republic appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action for reversion is barred by the statute of limitations or the indefeasibility of the Torrens title.
2. W/N Commonwealth Act No. 456 is unconstitutional for restricting the area of public land an individual may acquire by homestead.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The statute of limitations does not run against the State. While the Torrens title became indefeasible one year after issuance, the State may still seek reconveyance if the land was erroneously granted due to a transgression of the law. The issue of whether Ramos made the false statement in good faith is a matter of evidence to be determined at trial, not on a motion to dismiss. Under Section 91 of C.A. No. 141, false statements in an application shall *ipso facto* cause the cancellation of the concession.

2. **NO.** The CFI erred in declaring the law unconstitutional. Article XIII, Section 2 of the Constitution provides that no individual may acquire public agricultural lands *in excess* of 24 hectares. This provision sets a maximum ceiling; it prohibits legislation that *increases* the limit beyond 24 hectares, but it does not prohibit Congress from enacting laws, such as C.A. No. 456, that *decrease* the allowable area or limit the number of homestead entries an individual may acquire.

The Order appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **REMANDED** to the court below for further proceedings.
