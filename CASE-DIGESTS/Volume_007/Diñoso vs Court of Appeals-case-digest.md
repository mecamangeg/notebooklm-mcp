I. CAPTION
LUPO L. DIÑOSO v. COURT OF APPEALS and ANTONIO P. FONTILLAS, G.R. No. L-17738, April 22, 1963, 7 SCRA 666, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On December 18, 1944, Respondent Antonio P. Fontillas bought a parcel of land in Cabangan, Zambales from Modesta Feria under a *pacto de retro* sale. Feria failed to redeem the property by the December 1, 1945 deadline, allowing Fontillas to consolidate ownership on January 10, 1946.

Petitioner Lupo L. Diñoso, however, claimed he purchased land from Feria via an earlier *pacto de retro* sale on April 6, 1940, took possession, and registered it in 1948. Fontillas filed an action for recovery on September 4, 1952. The Court of Appeals found that the land sold to Diñoso was actually different from the land sold to Fontillas. In the lower court, Diñoso solely defended his ownership based on his deed of sale and did not plead adverse possession. On appeal, Diñoso changed his theory, arguing he acquired title to Fontillas's land by prescription.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner can raise the defense of adverse possession on appeal when it was not pleaded in the answer.
2. W/N the petitioner acquired title by prescription through possession under a *pacto de retro* sale.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Rules of Court abolished general denials and require defendants to allege all defenses, both negative and positive, to prevent unfair surprise. Diñoso expressly pleaded ownership via deed in his answer and never alleged adverse possession [1, 2]. Allowing him to change his theory on appeal would be unfair, as it deprived the respondent of the opportunity to prove that the occupancy lacked the requirements of hostility, openness, or continuity [3].

2. **NO.** Even if the defense were admitted, Diñoso’s possession under a *pacto de retro* sale (Exhibit 1) did not become hostile or adverse until the expiration of the redemption period. Until that time, a vendee *a retro* recognizes the superior right of the vendor to repurchase and oust him; thus, the claim of ownership is not absolute [4].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
