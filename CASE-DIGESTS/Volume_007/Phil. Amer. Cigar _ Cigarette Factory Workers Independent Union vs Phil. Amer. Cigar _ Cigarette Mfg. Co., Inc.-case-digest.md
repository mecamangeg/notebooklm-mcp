I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE AMERICAN CIGAR & CIGARETTE FACTORY WORKERS INDEPENDENT UNION (NLU) v. PHILIPPINE AMERICAN CIGAR & CIGARETTE MANUFACTURING CO., INC., G.R. No. L-18364, February 28, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On October 23, 1958, Francisco San Jose, an employee of respondent company and union member, filed an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charge against the company (Case No. 1857-ULP). Subsequently, the company manager, Chua Yiong, threatened the Union President that if Francisco did not withdraw the charge, the company would dismiss Francisco's brother, Apolonio San Jose, who was also an employee. When Francisco refused to withdraw the charge, the company dismissed Apolonio on January 24, 1959.

The Union filed a complaint for ULP on behalf of Apolonio. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found that the refusal to withdraw the charges was indeed the moving cause of the dismissal. However, the CIR dismissed the ULP complaint, ruling that under Section 4(a)(5) of Republic Act No. 875, ULP is committed only if the employee dismissed is the one who filed the charges. The CIR ordered reinstatement but without backpay, believing it lacked jurisdiction to treat it as a ULP case. The Union appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of an employee because his brother refused to withdraw ULP charges against the employer constitutes Unfair Labor Practice.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that while Section 4(a)(5) of Republic Act No. 875 technically refers to the dismissal of the employee who filed the charges, it must be construed in line with the spirit of the law, which assures absolute freedom for employees to establish labor organizations and prefer charges for labor law violations.

The Court held that if dismissing the employee who filed charges is an undue restraint on this freedom, dismissing his brother for non-withdrawal of those charges is a "greater and more effective restraint." A complainant might risk personal retaliation but may not withstand the pressure of having a family member victimized. Relying on US jurisprudence (*Quidnick Dye Works*, *Memphis Furniture Co.*), the Court applied the principle that what is prohibited directly cannot be done indirectly. The dismissal of relatives of an employee who has been discriminated against is itself a discriminatory discharge. Consequently, the dismissal violates not only Section 4(a)(5) but also Section 4(a)(4) regarding discrimination to discourage union membership.

The petition was granted. The CIR decision was reversed, finding the respondent guilty of unfair labor practice and ordering the reinstatement of Apolonio San Jose with backpay.
