I. CAPTION
PAZ ARELLANO TOLEDO v. ATTY. JESUS B. TOLEDO, Adm. Case No. 266, April 27, 1963.

II. FACTS
Complainant Paz Arellano Toledo and Respondent Atty. Jesus B. Toledo were married in 1946 [1]. Respondent subsequently abandoned Complainant and cohabited with another woman named Corazon Toledo in Malaybalay, Bukidnon, with whom he had a child [2, 3]. During the disbarment investigation conducted by the Solicitor General, Respondent filed a motion to dismiss but did not file an answer stating an intention to present evidence [4, 5]. It was only at the close of the hearing that he expressed a desire to present evidence [4]. Witnesses Marina Payot (a maid) and Lino Domingo testified that Respondent and Corazon lived as husband and wife [2, 3]. Respondent admitted to the marriage with Complainant but his annexes to the memorandum were rejected for not being properly introduced during the investigation [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Respondent waived his right to present evidence by failing to state such intent in an answer.
2. W/N Respondent should be disbarred for immorality.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Section 5 of Rule 128 of the Rules of Court (then in effect), a respondent in disbarment proceedings is required to file an answer to the complaint and, should he desire to present evidence, expressly say so in that answer [4]. The filing of a motion to dismiss without stating an intention to present evidence constitutes a waiver of that right [4, 8]. The proper time to make such intention known is in the answer seasonably filed, not at the close of the hearing [1, 4].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that Respondent failed to maintain the highest degree of morality expected and required of a member of the Bar [7]. The testimonial evidence established that Respondent abandoned his lawful wife and cohabited with another woman who bore him a child [6, 7]. Consequently, the Respondent is disbarred from the practice of law [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred with the decision [7]. Chief Justice Bautista took no part [9].
