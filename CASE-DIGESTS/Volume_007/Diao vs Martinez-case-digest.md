I. CAPTION
DIAO vs. MARTINEZ, G.R. Number and Date not indicated in source, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Telesforo A. Diao was admitted to the Bar after passing the 1953 examinations [1]. Two years later, Severino Martinez charged him with falsely representing in his application that he possessed the requisite academic qualifications [1]. The Solicitor General investigated and recommended Diao be removed from the roll of attorneys for failing to complete the required pre-legal education before taking up law subjects [1]. Specifically, Diao did not complete high school and never obtained an Associate in Arts (A.A.) diploma from Quisumbing College, contrary to the credentials submitted in his application [2].

Diao claimed his U.S. Army service was equivalent to a high school diploma, though he submitted no certification to prove this [2, 3]. Regarding the A.A. degree, Diao asserted he actually obtained it from Arellano University in April 1949 and was erroneously certified as a Quisumbing graduate [3]. The Court rejected this explanation because it revealed that Diao began his law studies (2nd semester 1948-1949) six months *before* obtaining his A.A. degree, violating the rule that pre-legal education must be completed *previous* to law study [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Diao's admission to the Bar should be revoked due to false representations regarding the completion of his pre-legal education.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that Diao was not qualified to take the bar examinations [5]. Diao's admission was obtained under false pretenses because he had not completed the required pre-legal education *previous* to the study of law [4, 5]. The Court ruled that passing the bar examinations is "not the only qualification to become an attorney-at-law; taking the prescribed courses of legal study in the regular manner is equally essential" [5].

The Clerk was ordered to strike the name of Telesforo A. Diao from the roll of attorneys, and Diao was required to return his lawyer’s diploma within thirty days [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred [6].
