I. CAPTION
C. N. HODGES v. THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF THE CITY OF ILOILO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18129, January 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On June 13, 1960, the Municipal Board of Iloilo City enacted Ordinance No. 33 pursuant to Republic Act No. 2264 (Local Autonomy Act). The ordinance imposed a sales tax of 1/2 of 1% on the selling price of second-hand motor vehicles and prohibited the registration of the sale in the Motor Vehicles Office of Iloilo unless the tax was paid. C. N. Hodges, a dealer of second-hand vehicles in the city, filed a petition for declaratory judgment with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo, challenging the ordinance's validity. The CFI rendered a decision holding the sales tax portion valid but declaring the provision requiring tax payment as a condition precedent for registration invalid, reasoning it violated the prohibition against imposing taxes on motor vehicle registration under Section 2(h) of RA 2264. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City of Iloilo is authorized to impose a percentage tax on the sale of second-hand motor vehicles.
2. W/N the City of Iloilo may validly require the payment of the sales tax as a condition precedent for the registration of the sale.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The City of Iloilo has the authority to approve the ordinance. Section 2 of Republic Act No. 2264 grants chartered cities the power to levy just and uniform taxes, licenses, or fees [1, 2]. While the Act prohibits municipalities and municipal districts from imposing percentage taxes on sales, this prohibition does not apply to chartered cities like Iloilo [3]. Therefore, the sales tax constitutes a valid exercise of the power of taxation granted to the city.

2. **YES.** The requirement to pay the tax before registration is valid. It does not constitute a tax on the registration of motor vehicles, which is prohibited under Section 2(h) of RA 2264 [4]. Instead, it is a coercive measure to ensure the effective enforcement and collection of the sales tax. The power to impose taxes carries with it the implied authority to devise ways and means to accomplish their collection in the most effective manner [4]. The Court relied on the principle that municipal corporations possess powers necessarily implied or essential to the accomplishment of their declared objects (*Dillon, Municipal Corporations*), including the means necessary to preserve the government's "lifeblood" [5, 6].

The decision appealed from is **MODIFIED**. Ordinance No. 33 of the City of Iloilo is declared valid, including the portion requiring tax payment as a condition precedent for registration [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Concepcion and J.B.L. Reyes voted for affirmance, indicating they would have upheld the lower court's decision which invalidated the condition precedent for registration [8].
