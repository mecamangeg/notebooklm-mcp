I. CAPTION
CEFERINO NOROMOR v. THE MUNICIPALITY OF ORAS, SAMAR, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18637, February 28, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ceferino Noromor was appointed as a policeman of Oras, Samar in August 1950 [1]. On January 16, 1951, he was suspended from office after being charged with frustrated murder [1]. Although convicted of less serious physical injuries by the trial court, the Court of Appeals acquitted him on July 16, 1954 [2]. Noromor was reinstated and demanded his back salaries for the suspension period (January 1951 to August 1954) totaling P1,957.50 [2]. The Municipal Treasurer prepared a voucher, but payment could not be made due to lack of appropriation in the budget [2]. Noromor filed a petition for mandamus against the new Mayor and municipal board [2]. Respondents argued that Noromor was not entitled to back salaries under Republic Act No. 557 because he was a civil service non-eligible [3]. The Court of First Instance of Samar ruled in favor of Noromor, ordering the respondents to appropriate funds and pay the back salaries [4]. Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a suspended policeman who is a civil service non-eligible is entitled to back salaries upon acquittal under Republic Act No. 557.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court [5]. Section 4 of Republic Act No. 557 expressly states that in case of acquittal, a suspended member of the police force "shall be entitled to payment of the entire salary he failed to receive during his suspension" [6]. The Court held that this provision is mandatory and clear [7]. The law makes no distinction between civil service eligibles and non-eligibles regarding the payment of back salaries upon acquittal [7]. The Court emphasized that the issue was not about the right to reinstatement or reappointment, but specifically the salary lost during an illegal suspension [7]. Additionally, the Court rejected the argument that Noromor's term was limited to three months, noting that his appointment had no time limitation and was not disapproved by the Commissioner of Civil Service [8].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [5].
