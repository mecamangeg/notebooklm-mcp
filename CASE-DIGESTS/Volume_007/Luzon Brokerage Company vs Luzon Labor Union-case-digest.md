I. CAPTION
LUZON BROKERAGE COMPANY v. LUZON LABOR UNION, G.R. No. L-17085, January 31, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
This case is a sequel to *Luzon Brokerage Company v. Luzon Labor Union* (G.R. No. L-6608). Previously, 425 employees sued for back pay for services rendered to the U.S. Army in Bataan during WWII, based on a promise by the petitioner's manager. The Supreme Court previously affirmed the existence of the cause of action but remanded the case to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) because the specific awards for each claimant had not been determined [1, 2].

In the new trial, the CIR limited proceedings to the determination of the specific amounts due, rejecting petitioner's attempt to re-litigate the existence of the right to back pay [2, 3]. Relying on affidavits and witness testimonies, the CIR awarded roughly P1,500,000 to 239 claimants [3, 4]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the trial scope was too restricted, the evidence was insufficient under technical rules, and that the claims were barred by the receipt of separation pay and U.S. Army wages [2, 5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR correctly limited the new trial to the determination of specific awards.
2. W/N the evidence (affidavits and testimonies) was sufficient to support the awards despite technical objections.
3. W/N the receipt of separation pay bars the recovery of back pay.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The remand ordered in G.R. No. L-6608 was specifically "to give opportunity to the claimants to present evidence to determine the amount of pay each of the claimants was entitled to" [1]. The Court had already settled the existence of the contract and the cause of action; thus, re-litigating these issues would be inconsistent with the previous decision [2].

2. **YES.** Under **Section 20 of Commonwealth Act No. 103**, the CIR acts according to justice and equity without regard to technicalities and is not bound by technical rules of evidence [4, 7]. The awards were sufficiently based on the affidavits of the claimants and the testimonies of 24 witnesses who identified the claimants [4, 8].

3. **NO.** Separation pay is distinct from the wages (back pay) an employee is entitled to. Separation pay is given at the time of separation from service, while back pay represents unpaid wages [7]. The granting of separation pay presupposes previous employment and does not waive the right to back pay [6]. Similarly, wages received from the U.S. Army for specific days worked do not bar claims based on the petitioner's promise to pay for the service duration in Bataan [9].

The petition is **DENIED** and the decision is **AFFIRMED** [10].
