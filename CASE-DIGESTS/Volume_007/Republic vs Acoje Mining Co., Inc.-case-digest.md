I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ACOJE MINING COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-18062, February 28, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant Acoje Mining Company requested the Director of Posts to open a post office at its mining camp in Zambales to service its employees [1]. The Director agreed, conditional on Acoje assuming direct responsibility for any pecuniary loss caused by the dishonesty or negligence of the assigned postmaster [2]. Acoje’s Board of Directors adopted a resolution accepting "full responsibility for all cash received by the Postmaster" [2]. Hilario Sanchez, an Acoje employee, was appointed postmaster but later disappeared, leaving a shortage of P13,867.24 [3].

The Republic sued Acoje for the shortage [4]. Acoje denied liability, arguing its Board resolution was *ultra vires* and void, and that its liability was merely that of a guarantor [4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila rejected these defenses and ordered Acoje to pay P9,515.25 (the amount supported by evidence) [5]. Acoje appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the resolution assuming responsibility for the postmaster is *ultra vires* and void.
2. W/N Acoje is liable only as a guarantor.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The resolution is valid and binding [6]. First, the establishment of a local post office is a reasonable and proper adjunct to the conduct of Acoje's business, as it promotes the welfare of employees in a remote mining camp [7]. Second, even assuming *arguendo* that the act was *ultra vires*, it is not illegal (*malum in se* or *malum prohibitum*) but merely voidable [8]. Acoje is estopped from denying liability because it induced the government to open the post office by promising to assume responsibility and received the benefits of the transaction [6]. An *ultra vires* act can be enforced by estoppel when the corporation has accepted the benefits of the performance by the other party [8, 9].

2. **NO.** Acoje is liable as a principal [10]. The Board resolution explicitly stated that the company accepted "full responsibility for all cash received by the Postmaster" [10]. The terms employed are clear and sweeping, indicating a primary obligation rather than a mere guaranty [10].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [11].
