I. CAPTION
MATA v. RITA LEGARDA, INC., G.R. No. L-18941, January 31, 1963, (Ponente not indicated in source).

II. FACTS
The case involves an action to compel the execution of a deed of absolute sale filed against the defendant corporation, Rita Legarda, Inc. [1]. The defendant appeared by counsel. During the proceedings, a notice of hearing was served upon an employee of the defendant corporation rather than its attorney of record [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the notice of hearing served upon an employee of the defendant corporation binds the attorney of record or the client.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that when a party appears by attorney in an action or proceeding, all notices required by law must be given to the attorney and not to the client [2]. Consequently, the notice of hearing served upon an employee of the defendant corporation was held not to bind the attorney of record nor the client [1]. The purpose of this rule is to maintain a uniform procedure and place the orderly prosecution of a party’s case in competent hands, as parties engage attorneys precisely because they may not be competent to deal with the intricacies of law and procedure [3, 4].
