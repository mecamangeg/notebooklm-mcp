I. CAPTION
EDUARDA DUELLOME v. BONIFACIO GOTICO, BERNARDINA GOTICO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17846, April 29, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Duellome leased a lot in Tacloban to Sixto Coronel, who constructed a house thereon. Respondents, spouses Gotico (Coronel's daughter and son-in-law), subsequently occupied the house. Initially, respondents paid P10.00 monthly to Duellome for the land and P10.00 to Coronel for the house. In 1955, due to Coronel's illness and financial need, respondents stopped paying Duellome and remitted the full rental amount to Coronel. Duellome wrote to the Superintendent of Public Schools (respondents' employer) complaining that Bonifacio Gotico was "renting one of my lands" and had failed to pay rent. Bonifacio denied renting the land, asserting he only rented the house. Duellome filed an ejectment suit, which was dismissed after Coronel paid the arrears. Respondents then filed a complaint for damages against Duellome, alleging her letter was malicious and besmirched their reputation. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's award of moral damages, ruling that Duellome's statement was false because the respondents were renting the house, not the land.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lease of a building includes the lease of the lot on which it stands, rendering the petitioner's claim that respondents were renting her land valid.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the lease of a building naturally includes the lease of the lot, and the rentals of the building include those of the lot. Citing *City of Manila v. Chan Kian* and *Phil. Consolidated Freight Lines, Inc. v. Ajon*, the Court explained that the occupancy of a building implies the tenancy or possession in fact of the land on which it is constructed; the two cannot be dissociated. Therefore, the petitioner’s declaration that the respondent was renting her land was not false or malicious. Furthermore, under **Article 1652 of the Civil Code**, the sublessee is subsidiarily liable to the lessor for any rent due from the lessee. Since the lessee (Coronel) was delinquent, the petitioner had the legal right to collect directly from the respondents (sublessees), and the respondents had no right to resist such action or claim damages for it.

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and set aside, and the complaint is dismissed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Reyes, J.B.L., J.**, concurred on the ground that a sublessee is liable to the lessor upon default of the lessee sublessor.
