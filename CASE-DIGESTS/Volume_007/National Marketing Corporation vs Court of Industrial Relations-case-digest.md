I. CAPTION
NATIONAL MARKETING CORPORATION and PRICE STABILIZATION CORPORATION v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and PRISCO WORKERS' UNION, G.R. No. [Not provided in source], January 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On August 25, 1953, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) rendered a partial decision in Case No. 840-V ordering the Price Stabilization Corporation (PRISCO) to pay 25% additional compensation for overtime, Sunday, and legal holiday work to 58 original petitioners [1, 2]. The CIR subsequently extended these benefits to other similarly situated workers, a ruling affirmed by the Supreme Court in *PRISCO v. PRISCO Workers’ Union* (G.R. No. L-9288) [3]. On June 17, 1955, PRISCO was abolished and succeeded by the National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO) [4].

On March 20, 1958, 202 other employees—including 45 employees of the General Auditing Office (GAO) assigned to PRISCO—filed a petition to enforce the 1953 partial decision for services rendered from 1951 to 1953 [4]. PRISCO and NAMARCO opposed, arguing that the claim had prescribed under the Eight-Hour Labor Law and that the GAO employees were not employees of PRISCO [4, 5]. The CIR granted the petition on June 10, 1960 [4]. Petitioners appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claim for overtime and holiday pay has prescribed.
2. W/N the GAO employees assigned to PRISCO are entitled to the benefits of the award as employees of the corporation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The claim has not prescribed. The petition filed on March 20, 1958, was not a new action but a motion for the execution of the final partial decision dated August 25, 1953, covering workers similarly situated [6]. Under Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, a final judgment may be enforced by motion within five years from its entry [6, 7]. Since only four years and seven months had elapsed between the 1953 decision and the 1958 petition, the action was filed within the reglementary period [7].

2. **NO.** The 45 GAO employees are not employees of PRISCO/NAMARCO for purposes of compensation benefits [8]. They are appointed, supervised, and controlled by the Auditor General to ensure independence and impartiality in fiscal control [8, 9]. The inclusion of their salaries in PRISCO's budget is merely a designation of the fund source and does not create an employer-employee relationship [10]. Consequently, they are governed by general civil service laws applicable to regular government employees, not by the special labor laws applicable to government-controlled corporations [10, 11].

The judgment of the CIR is **MODIFIED** by reversing the award insofar as it includes the 45 GAO employees. In all other respects, the judgment is **AFFIRMED**.
