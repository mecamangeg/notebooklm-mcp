I. CAPTION
DIOSDADO ESPINOSA v. HON. NICASIO A. YATCO and J. M. TUASON & CO., INC., G.R. No. L-16435, January 31, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On March 5, 1959, respondent J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. filed a case against petitioner Diosdado Espinosa for the recovery of possession of a registered parcel of land in Quezon City [1]. The trial was set for June 25, 1959, but on said date, Espinosa's counsel verbally moved for a continuance, claiming Espinosa was away on a mission. The trial court denied the motion and proceeded [2]. Espinosa received a copy of the adverse decision on June 30, 1959 [3]. However, instead of filing a motion for new trial or perfecting an appeal within the reglementary period, he allowed the judgment to become final. Later, he filed a petition for relief from judgment under Rule 38, which the lower court denied [4, 5]. Espinosa filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Supreme Court to annul the denial order and compel the approval of his appeal [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for relief from judgment should be granted despite the petitioner's failure to avail of the remedy of appeal or new trial.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the relief provided for by Rule 38 is of an equitable character and is allowed only in exceptional cases where there is no available or other adequate remedy [3, 6]. In this case, the petitioner had adequate remedies available to him, specifically a motion for new trial or an appeal, as he admittedly received the decision on June 30, 1959, and had ample time to pursue these actions [3].

The Court ruled that relief will not be granted to a party when the loss of the remedy at law was due to their own negligence or a mistaken mode of procedure [5, 7]. To sustain the petition for relief would be tantamount to reviving a right of appeal that had already been lost. Furthermore, the Court noted that the petitioner's defense—claiming ownership by possession against a Torrens Title—was a collateral attack and insufficient to justify reopening the case [8].

WHEREFORE, the petition for certiorari and mandamus is denied, and the preliminary injunction heretofore issued dissolved, with costs against petitioner [9].
