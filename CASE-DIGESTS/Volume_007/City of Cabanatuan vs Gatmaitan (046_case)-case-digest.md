I. CAPTION
CITY OF CABANATUAN, ET AL. v. THE HON. MAGNO S. GATMAITAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19129, February 28, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
The Manila Railroad Company (MRR), a government-owned corporation, owns several parcels of land in Cabanatuan City used for its transportation business. The City of Cabanatuan assessed real estate taxes on these properties for the years 1945 to 1949, totaling P41,806.68. MRR claimed tax exemption under its charter (Act No. 1510). However, due to the City's threat of forfeiture, MRR paid the taxes under protest on November 27, 1959.

MRR subsequently filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to recover the amount paid. The CFI rendered judgment in favor of MRR, ordering the City to refund the taxes. After the decision became final and a writ of execution was issued, the City filed a motion to quash, arguing for the first time that the CFI lacked jurisdiction and that the case fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) pursuant to Republic Act No. 1125. The CFI denied the motion, prompting the City to file a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over a case involving the refund of real estate taxes paid under protest.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the case falls under the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance, not the Court of Tax Appeals.

Under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125, the CTA has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the Collector of Internal Revenue involving *refunds* of internal revenue taxes. However, regarding real property, the CTA's jurisdiction is limited to reviewing decisions of provincial or city Boards of Assessment Appeals in cases involving the *assessment and taxation* of real property.

Applying the principle of *expressio unius est exclusio alterius*, since the law explicitly mentions refunds only in relation to internal revenue taxes, it excludes refunds of real estate taxes from the CTA's jurisdiction [1]. Furthermore, the jurisdiction of the City Board of Assessment Appeals is confined to determining the reasonableness of the assessment; it has no authority to require a refund of taxes already paid [2]. Consequently, an action for the refund of real estate taxes is properly filed with the Court of First Instance.

The petition is dismissed, the decision of the lower court is affirmed, and the writ of injunction is dissolved.
