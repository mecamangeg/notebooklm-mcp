I. CAPTION
SUN BROTHERS APPLIANCES, INC. v. DAMASO P. PEREZ, G.R. No. L-17527, April 30, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On December 6, 1958, Sun Brothers Appliances, Inc. (plaintiff) and Damaso P. Perez (defendant) entered into a Conditional Sale Agreement for an air conditioner at the price of P1,678.00. The contract stipulated that while title to the property would vest in the buyer only upon full payment, the buyer assumed the risk of loss "for any cause" after delivery [1, 2]. The unit was installed in Perez's office in Lucena, Quezon. On December 27, 1958, the air conditioner was destroyed by fire [3]. Sun Brothers sued Perez for the unpaid balance. Perez refused to pay, arguing that the loss was due to force majeure and, since title remained with the vendor, he should not be liable. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Sun Brothers, enforcing the stipulation that the buyer bears the loss [2, 4]. Perez appealed directly to the Supreme Court on a question of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the buyer is liable to pay the price of the thing sold which was destroyed by a fortuitous event, even if title remained with the vendor.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. The Court held that the stipulation in the conditional sale agreement making the buyer responsible for any loss "for any cause," including fortuitous events, is valid [1, 5]. Although title remained with the vendor, the parties expressly agreed that the risk of loss would be borne by the buyer. This stipulation is allowed under Article 1174 of the Civil Code, which permits parties to contractually accept liability for fortuitous events [6, 7]. Furthermore, the Court cited American jurisprudence stating that such stipulations are based on sound public policy, as the buyer has the use and control of the goods and should have the incentive to care for them properly [8]. The judgment of the lower court was affirmed [5].
