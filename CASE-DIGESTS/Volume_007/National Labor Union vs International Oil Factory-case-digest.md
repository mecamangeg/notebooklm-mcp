I. CAPTION
NATIONAL LABOR UNION, ET AL. v. INTERNATIONAL OIL FACTORY, G.R. No. L-18425, February 27, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In 1949, a labor dispute regarding vacation leave demands arose between petitioners (NLU) and respondent International Oil Factory. On May 11, 1951, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) rendered a decision granting employees 15 days of vacation leave "as long as its financial condition permits" [1, 2]. On December 5, 1955, the CIR *en banc* issued a resolution referring the case to the trial court to determine the company's financial condition "from the year 1951 up to the present" [3, 4].

Subsequently, a separate issue regarding a compromise agreement with a breakaway union reached the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-13845 (decided in 1960). In the statement of facts of that decision, the Court mentioned that the CIR resolution covered the period "1951 to 1955" [5]. Relying on this statement, the CIR *en banc* issued a resolution on March 23, 1961, limiting the NLU's examination of the company's books to the period of 1951 to 1955, reversing the trial court's order which allowed examination up to 1960 [6, 7]. NLU appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the NLU is entitled to examine the respondent's books of accounts from 1951 to 1960 despite the mention of "1951 to 1955" in a previous Supreme Court decision.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court set aside the CIR *en banc* resolution and held that the NLU is entitled to examine the records from 1951 to 1960 [3].

The Court reasoned that the CIR resolution of December 5, 1955, which granted the opportunity to prove financial condition "up to the present," had already become final and executory before the appeal in G.R. No. L-13845 and could not have been modified by it [3, 7]. The mention of "1951 to 1955" in the previous Supreme Court decision was merely descriptive because the resolution discussed was dated December 1955, and the period of examination was not an issue in that case [3, 7]. Furthermore, since the grant of vacation leave depends on the company's financial condition, there is no valid reason to limit the benefit to 1955 if the financial condition continues to permit it thereafter [3].

The resolution appealed from is set aside, and the case is remanded to the trial court [8].
