I. CAPTION
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, represented by its Agents, THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. TOBIAS, No. L-17467, April 23, 1963.

II. FACTS
On May 13, 1946, respondent Jose Yulo Tobias issued a promissory note for P7,000.00 payable "on demand after date" to the order of petitioner National Development Company (NDC) [1]. On March 22, 1960, nearly 14 years later, NDC filed a complaint to recover the balance of P6,905.81 [1]. Tobias moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of prescription, arguing that more than 10 years had elapsed since the cause of action accrued [1]. The lower court granted the dismissal [1]. NDC appealed, arguing that as an instrumentality of the Government, the statute of limitations does not run against it [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action filed by the National Development Company is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The National Development Company (NDC) is subject to the statute of limitations [2]. The Supreme Court held that while NDC is an instrumentality of the Government, it does not exercise sovereign functions [2, 3]. Citing *Association Cooperativa de Credito Agricola de Miagao vs. Monteclaro*, the Court ruled that NDC is a business corporation performing purely proprietary or business functions [2-4]. Under its Organic Act (Commonwealth Act 182, as amended), NDC is subject to the Corporation Law and authorized to engage in commercial and industrial enterprises [5, 6]. Because it does not exercise sovereign powers, it cannot invoke the government's exemption from prescription [5, 6].

The order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED** [7].
