I. CAPTION
RICARDO PRESBITERO, in his capacity as Executor of the Testate Estate of ESPERIDION PRESBITERO v. THE HON. JOSE F. FERNANDEZ, HELEN CARAM NAVA, and the PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, G.R. No. L-19527, March 30, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Helen Caram Nava obtained a final judgment against Esperidion Presbitero for the reconveyance of land or payment of its value [1, 2]. To satisfy the judgment, the Sheriff levied upon and garnished sugar quotas allotted to Presbitero's plantation [3]. The Sheriff served the notice of garnishment to the Sugar Central and the Sugar Quota Administration but failed to file copies of the writ and notice with the Register of Deeds [3]. Esperidion Presbitero died shortly thereafter [4]. Petitioner, as administrator of the estate, moved to stop the auction, arguing the levy was void because sugar quotas are real property and the notice was not registered with the Register of Deeds [4]. The auction proceeded, Nava won the bid, and the trial court affirmed the sale [5, 6]. Petitioner sought certiorari to annul the sale [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N sugar quotas are real (immovable) property, rendering a levy upon them void if not registered with the Register of Deeds.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Sugar quotas are real (immovable) property. By express provision of law—specifically Section 9 of Act 4166 (Sugar Limitation Law) and Section 4 of R.A. No. 1825—a sugar quota allocation is "deemed to be an improvement attaching to the land" [7-9]. As an improvement and a real right over immovable property, it falls under Article 415(10) of the Civil Code [10]. Quotas are inseparable from the land and cannot exist without a corresponding plantation [11]. While trade laws allow the voluntary transfer of quotas apart from the land, this does not alter their nature as immovable property for the purpose of involuntary levies [11]. Consequently, the levy was null and void for failing to comply with Section 14, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which requires filing a copy of the order and description of the property with the Register of Deeds for execution upon real property [7, 12]. The Sheriff’s certificate of sale is declared null and void [13].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
