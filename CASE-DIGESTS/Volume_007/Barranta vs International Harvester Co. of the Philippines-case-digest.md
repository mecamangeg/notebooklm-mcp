I. CAPTION
LUZ BARRANTA v. INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18198, April 22, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Luz Barranta, employed as Secretary to the Treasurer of International Harvester since 1947, was suspended and subsequently terminated in December 1956 without lawful cause [1-3]. She filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal seeking reinstatement with back wages, damages for malicious criminal charges filed against her, recovery of pension contributions, and accrued sick leave pay [4, 5]. The CFI dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that actions for reinstatement due to wrongful severance fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [6, 7]. Barranta appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over a claim for reinstatement and damages which does not involve unfair labor practice or specific labor law violations.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CFI's order. The Court held that a mere claim for reinstatement does not suffice to bring a case within the jurisdiction of the CIR [8, 9].

Applying the doctrine in *Campos v. Manila Railroad Co.*, the Court explained that for the CIR to acquire jurisdiction, two requisites must concur: (a) there is an existing employer-employee relationship or the claimant seeks reinstatement; AND (b) the controversy relates to a case certified by the President involving national interest, bears on an unfair labor practice charge, or arises under the Eight-Hour Labor Law or Minimum Wage Law [10]. In default of any of these circumstances, the claim becomes a mere money claim under the jurisdiction of regular courts [10].

Here, while Barranta sought reinstatement, she did not allege unfair labor practice, nor did the case involve a Presidential certification or violations of the Eight-Hour Labor or Minimum Wage Laws [9]. Therefore, her claims for reinstatement, damages, and benefits are cognizable by the CFI.

The order of dismissal was reversed, and the case was remanded to the lower court for trial [11].
