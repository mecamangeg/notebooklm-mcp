The source material provided appears to be an **Annotation: The Jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals** rather than the full text of the Supreme Court decision *City of Cabanatuan vs. Gatmaitan*.

Consequently, the source does not contain the specific facts, procedural history, or full ruling necessary to create a complete case digest. It only cites *City of Cabanatuan vs. Gatmaitan* (G.R. No. L-19125) in passing to support the legal principle that matters not enumerated in Section 7 of R.A. No. 1125 fall under the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court), rather than the Court of Tax Appeals [1].

Would you like me to search for the full text of *City of Cabanatuan vs. Gatmaitan* so I can write the proper case digest for you?
