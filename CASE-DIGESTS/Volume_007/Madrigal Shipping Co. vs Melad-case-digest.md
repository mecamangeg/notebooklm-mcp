I. CAPTION
**MADRIGAL SHIPPING CO., INC. v. MONICA MELAD, ET AL.**, G.R. Nos. L-17362 and L-17367-69, February 28, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Madrigal Shipping Co. owned the S.S. "Cetus." On November 25, 1955, the ship left Aparri but was forced to return for rudder repairs. The captain telegraphed the ship's agent to request a pilot. The agent informed the Aparri Pilots' Association, and pilots Primitivo Siccuan and Francisco Ricerra engaged Filoteo Siccuan and Domingo Batta (as sounder and oarsman) to transport them to the vessel. While the pilots and Filoteo boarded the ship, it sank due to heavy waves, resulting in the deaths of Primitivo, Francisco, Filoteo, and Domingo.

Claims were filed with the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) and transferred to Regional Office No. 2 of the Department of Labor under Reorganization Plan 20-A. The Regional Office awarded compensation to the heirs, which the WCC *en banc* affirmed. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, challenging the jurisdiction of the Regional Office and denying the existence of an employer-employee relationship, arguing the Pilots' Association was an independent contractor.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Regional Offices of the Department of Labor have jurisdiction to decide workmen's compensation claims under Reorganization Plan 20-A.
2. W/N there was an employer-employee relationship between the petitioner and the deceased pilots and crewmen.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Regional Offices have authority to hear workmen's compensation claims. The Court held that Reorganization Plan 20-A is valid regarding workmen's compensation because it merely reallocated powers already possessed by the Department of Labor, unlike in other labor cases (e.g., *Miller v. Mardo*) where the grant of judicial power was deemed invalid. There was no assumption of powers not previously vested in the Department.

2. **YES.** An employer-employee relationship existed.
Regarding the pilots, the Court held that the Aparri Pilots' Association was not an independent contractor because it had no capital or bond; thus, the pilots were employees of the petitioner despite being paid through the Association (*Madrigal Shipping Co., Inc. v. WCC*). Furthermore, the petitioner retained control, as Customs Administrative Order No. 26 makes a pilot's conduct subject to the vessel master's approval.
Regarding the sounder and oarsman, they were deemed employees under an implied contract of hire because they were engaged during an emergency to help the ship return to port (*I Larson, Workmen’s Compensation Law*).
Finally, even if the Association were an independent contractor, petitioner would still be liable as a statutory employer under Section 39(a) of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as pilotage is in the usual course of the shipping business.

Decision affirmed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
