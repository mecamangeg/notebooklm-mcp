I. CAPTION
COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. AMERICAN RUBBER COMPANY and the COURT OF TAX APPEALS; and AMERICAN RUBBER COMPANY v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. Nos. L-10963 and L-11178, April 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
American Rubber Company owns an 800-hectare rubber plantation in Basilan City. It produces latex from rubber trees and processes it into various forms, such as Preserved Latex, Pale Crepe, Ribbed Smoked Sheets, and Brown Crepe. The production involves tapping latex, adding chemicals like ammonia or acetic acid for preservation and coagulation, and passing the coagulum through mechanical rollers to form sheets which are then air-dried or smoked. The Company sells these products locally and abroad. On April 12, 1955, the Company filed a claim for refund of P57,703.37 representing sales taxes paid from the first quarter of 1953 to the fourth quarter of 1954, arguing it is exempt under Section 188(b) of the National Internal Revenue Code as an agricultural producer.

The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled that Preserved Latex, Flat Bark Rubber, and 3X Brown Crepe were agricultural products and ordered a refund of P16,749.76. However, the CTA held that Pale Crepe No. 1, Ribbed Smoked Sheets, and 2X Brown Crepe were manufactured articles subject to tax, denying the refund for those items. Both the Collector of Internal Revenue and the Company appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the rubber products processed by American Rubber Company are agricultural products exempt from sales tax under Section 188(b) of the Tax Code.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the rubber products are exempt agricultural products.

Under Section 188(b) of the Tax Code, as it stood during the taxable period (1953–1954) and before the enactment of R.A. No. 1612, agricultural products were exempt from sales tax "whether in their original state or not" when sold by the producer. The Court found that the processing steps employed by the Company—such as adding acetic acid to hasten coagulation and using rollers—were essential agricultural practices performed to preserve the products and make them marketable, rather than manufacturing processes.

Citing *Philippine Packing Corp. v. Collector of Internal Revenue* and *Tan Kim Kee v. Court of Tax Appeals*, the Court ruled that where a planter works his product into a more convenient and valuable form as an incident to farming operations, he remains a producer and not a manufacturer. The exemption is not Divested merely because the products undergo processing to prevent deterioration. Since American Rubber Company produces the latex from its own plantation and does not buy raw materials from others to manufacture goods, it is entitled to the exemption.

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is MODIFIED. The Collector of Internal Revenue is ordered to refund to American Rubber Company the total sum of P57,662.94.
