I. CAPTION
RADIOWEALTH, INC. v. JOSE LAVIN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18563, April 27, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Jose Lavin purchased a Rotavator machinery from Radiowealth, Inc. on an installment basis, secured by a chattel mortgage on the unit [1]. Lavin failed to pay the installments, causing the entire balance to become due [2]. On September 30, 1957, Radiowealth notified the Provincial Sheriff of Ilocos Sur of its desire to foreclose the chattel mortgage [2]. The Sheriff found the property and Lavin offered no objection, but the auction sale scheduled for December 18, 1957, was suspended after Radiowealth's counsel requested to stop the foreclosure [3].

On March 14, 1958, Radiowealth filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Manila to recover the unpaid balance [4]. The trial court dismissed the complaint, ruling that Radiowealth's previous election to foreclose the mortgage precluded it from suing for the balance under Article 1484 of the Civil Code [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the vendor-mortgagee is barred from suing for the unpaid balance of the purchase price after initiating, but voluntarily desisting from, the extrajudicial foreclosure of the chattel mortgage.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the plaintiff is not barred from suing on the unpaid account [7]. Under Article 1484 of the Civil Code, the vendor has the option to exercise any one of the alternative remedies: exact fulfillment, cancel the sale, or foreclose the chattel mortgage [7]. However, in this case, the vendor-mortgagee desisted from consummating the auction sale on its own initiative, without gaining any advantage or causing disadvantage to the mortgagors [7]. The Court ruled that such desistance was a timely disavowal that cancelled the previous choice. Because the remedy of foreclosure was not fully "exercised" or implemented, the plaintiff is not precluded from pursuing the alternative remedy of exacting fulfillment of the obligation [7].

The decision of the court *a quo* was set aside, and the case was remanded for further proceedings [8].
