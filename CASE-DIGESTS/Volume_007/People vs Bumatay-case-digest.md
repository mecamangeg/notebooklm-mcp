I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ALEJANDRO BUMATAY, CASIMIRO OBILLO, CAMILO DINGLE, ALFREDO VALDEZ, MARCELO ORPIANO, MARCELINO OBAR and SALVADOR MONTILLA, G.R. No. L-16620, April 30, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of July 15-16, 1958, a band of armed thieves broke into the bakery and store of Alfonso Chan Pinco in Balaoan, La Union [1]. As the malefactors fired shots, Chan Pinco jumped from the fire escape and was shot in the foot [1, 2]. Meanwhile, Salvacion Ostrea, a neighbor across the street, focused her flashlight on the scene and was shot in the breast by one of the robbers, causing her death [2]. The band stole cash and items worth P4,500 [2].

Prosecution witnesses, including the victims and household help, positively identified the appellants as the culprits [3-6]. The identification was corroborated by the confessions of co-accused Norberto Paguirigan (who pleaded guilty) and Marcelino Obar [7, 8]. The appellants set up alibis claiming they were elsewhere (home, fields, or injured) during the crime [9-12]. The Court of First Instance of La Union convicted them of robbery in band with homicide and frustrated homicide, sentencing them to death [13].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused are guilty of the crime charged despite their defense of alibi.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the testimony of the prosecution witnesses was clear, positive, straightforward, and devoid of signs of artificiality [12]. These witnesses had no motive to falsely incriminate the appellants, most of whom were well-known to them [12].

The Court held that the alibis presented were inherently weak and could not offset the direct and positive evidence regarding the appellants' presence and participation in the crime [14]. Specifically, Bumatay's claim of a foot injury was disproven by the lack of a scar, and other alibis were contradicted by family members or factual inconsistencies [15, 16].

The crime committed was robbery in band with homicide and frustrated homicide, aggravated by evident premeditation, nocturnity, and dwelling, warranting the maximum penalty under Article 294, No. 1 of the Revised Penal Code [17]. However, due to the lack of necessary votes for the death penalty, the sentence was modified to life imprisonment. The indemnity to Alfonso Chan Pinco was reduced to P4,500 [17, 18].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed with modification; penalty reduced to life imprisonment and indemnity to P4,500.
