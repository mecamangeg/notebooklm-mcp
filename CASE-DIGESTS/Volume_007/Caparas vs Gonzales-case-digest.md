I. CAPTION
GERONIMO E. CAPARAS v. DOMINGO C. GONZALES and SANTIAGO L. LINDAYAG, G.R. No. L-18515, January 31, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On September 20, 1960, respondent Chief of Police Domingo Gonzales filed a complaint for "Serious Physical Injuries Thru Reckless Imprudence" against petitioner Geronimo Caparas in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Guiguinto, Bulacan [1]. The complaint alleged that Caparas, a bus driver, negligently caused a passenger, Ho Mo, to fall and suffer "serious physical injury," but did not specify the medical attendance required [2, 3].

During the trial, the defense objected to the testimony of a doctor regarding the victim's treatment, arguing that since the complaint did not allege medical attendance, the charge was effectively only for slight physical injuries [3, 4]. The prosecution then moved to amend the complaint to specify the injuries (e.g., spinal concussion) and state that they required medical attendance for 2-3 months [5, 6]. The JP Court admitted the amended complaint [5].

Caparas filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan. The CFI ruled that the amendment was null and void, holding that it was a matter of substance that prejudiced the accused by changing the nature of the crime from one not requiring medical attendance to a more serious form [7, 8]. The respondents appealed to the Supreme Court [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the amendment of the criminal complaint to include details of injuries and medical attendance constitutes a substantial amendment prejudicial to the accused.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the amendment was merely formal and proper. The Court reasoned that the amendment "neither changed the offense nor introduced new material facts different from those alleged in the original complaint" [10].

The original complaint already charged Caparas with "Serious Physical Injuries." The amendment merely made this general statement more specific by introducing details and particulars regarding the wounds and medical attendance [10]. The Court ruled that the term "grave physical injury" has a well-defined meaning, and specifying the injuries does not change the nature or gravity of the offense charged [11]. Furthermore, such an amendment is beneficial to the accused as it provides better information to prepare a defense [11].

The Order of the CFI was **REVERSED**, and the case was remanded to the Justice of the Peace Court for continuation of proceedings [12].
