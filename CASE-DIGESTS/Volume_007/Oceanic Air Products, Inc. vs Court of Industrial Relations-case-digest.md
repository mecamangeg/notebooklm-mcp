I. CAPTION
OCEANIC AIR PRODUCTS, INC. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and OCEANIC AIR PRODUCTS INCORPORATED EMPLOYEES UNION; and OCEANIC AIR PRODUCTS EMPLOYEES UNION v. OCEANIC AIR PRODUCTS INCORPORATED EMPLOYEES UNION and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. Nos. L-18704 & L-18705, January 31, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
The Complainant Union, Oceanic Air Products Incorporated Employees Union, was organized on April 25, 1958. On June 12, 1958, it sent a letter of demands to the President of Oceanic Air Products, Inc. (Company) for better working conditions, which went unanswered [1]. On July 3, 1958, immediately after the Production Manager received another copy of the demands, the Company President dismissed seven employees who were ranking officers and members of the Complainant Union [1, 2]. Officers who disaffiliated from the Complainant Union and joined the rival "Respondent Union" (Oceanic Air Products Employees Union) were not dismissed [2].

The Company claimed the dismissals were due to financial losses incurred from 1956 to 1958 and the employees' unsatisfactory performance [2, 3]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled in favor of the Complainant Union, ordering the reinstatement of the dismissed employees and the disestablishment of the Respondent Union as a company-dominated entity [4, 5]. The Company and the Respondent Union appealed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal of the Complainant Union's officers and members constitutes an unfair labor practice.
2. W/N the Respondent Union is a company-dominated union.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the CIR's finding that the dismissals were discriminatory and constituted unfair labor practice. Although financial losses may justify retrenchment, the Company's motive became questionable because the dismissals occurred only after the union presented demands, despite the alleged losses existing since 1956 [6, 7]. Furthermore, the Company specifically targeted the Complainant Union's leaders while sparing former officers who switched to the Respondent Union [7]. The defense of "laziness" was rejected because the Company did not dismiss another employee caught sleeping who had joined the Respondent Union [7].

2. **YES.** The Respondent Union was proven to be company-dominated. Evidence showed that the Company's treasurer/production manager forced employees to sign applications for the Respondent Union under threat of dismissal and urged them to attend its organizational meeting, which was also attended by the Company's manager and legal counsel [8]. Additionally, no member of the Respondent Union was dismissed during the alleged retrenchment, and the Company even hired new laborers after dismissing the Complainant Union's officers [8].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [9].
