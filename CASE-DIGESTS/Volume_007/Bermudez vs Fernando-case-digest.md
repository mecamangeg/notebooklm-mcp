I. CAPTION
ANGEL BERMUDEZ, ET AL. v. MARGARITA FERNANDO, G.R. No. L-18610, April 22, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Bermudez and Sampaga were share tenants of Respondent Fernando in Nueva Ecija. Under their 1958-1959 tenancy contracts, the sharing system was 50-50, with transplanting expenses borne by the respondent. In August 1960, respondent tendered P45.00 and P60.00 to the petitioners for the 1960-1961 transplanting expenses, but they refused to accept the money. Respondent subsequently consigned the amounts with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR).

Petitioners alleged that in January 1960, they had notified the respondent of their desire to change their tenancy from sharehold to leasehold pursuant to Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199, and that they had already defrayed the transplanting expenses. The CAR ruled in favor of the respondent, finding no evidence in the record that petitioners had actually notified the respondent of the change in system, and determining that respondent's tender of payment was made before the commencement of the transplanting season.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the findings of fact of the Court of Agrarian Relations may be reviewed and reversed by the Supreme Court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the findings of fact of the Court of Agrarian Relations may not be reviewed and reversed so long as there is substantial evidence in the record to support them (*Atayde vs. De Guzman*, G.R. No. L-10578).

In this case, the Court noted that the petitioners failed to mention the alleged notification to change tenancy systems in their testimony. Furthermore, the lower court correctly found that the respondent's tender of expenses occurred prior to the transplanting season. Since the CAR's findings were fully supported by the evidence, the decision appealed from was **AFFIRMED**.
