I. CAPTION
**EDMUNDO GRACELLA v. EL COLEGIO DEL HOSPICIO DE SAN JOSE, INC.**, G.R. No. L-15151, January 31, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In 1952, Edmundo Gracella was hired by El Colegio del Hospicio de San Jose, Inc. (Hospicio) as a laborer and later as a cook. He was dismissed five years later [1]. On February 28, 1958, Gracella filed a complaint with Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor for unpaid wages and overtime pay [1]. The Regional Office dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that the Hospicio was a charitable institution not subject to labor laws [2]. Gracella’s appeal was denied due to late filing [2].

Subsequently, on October 29, 1958, Gracella filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila for the same money claims [2]. The CFI dismissed the complaint on two grounds: (1) lack of jurisdiction, holding that the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) had original jurisdiction over claims under the Minimum Wage and Eight-Hour Labor Laws; and (2) *res judicata*, due to the prior dismissal by the Regional Office [3, 4]. Gracella appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal by the Regional Office on the ground of lack of jurisdiction constitutes *res judicata*.
2. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the claim for unpaid wages and overtime pay.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal of a complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction does not constitute *res judicata* [3, 5]. Since the Regional Office dismissed the first case precisely because it lacked jurisdiction, that dismissal cannot bar the filing of the subsequent action in the proper court.

2. **YES.** The Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) has jurisdiction. The Court explained that disputes under the Minimum Wage Law and the Eight-Hour Labor Law fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations only if they arise while the employer-employee relationship exists, or if a former employee seeks reinstatement [4]. In this case, the employer-employee relationship had already ceased, and Gracella was not seeking reinstatement but merely the payment of money claims [6]. Therefore, the claim is properly cognizable by the ordinary courts [6].

**The order dismissing the complaint is SET ASIDE and the record is REMANDED to the court *a quo* for further proceedings.** [6]
