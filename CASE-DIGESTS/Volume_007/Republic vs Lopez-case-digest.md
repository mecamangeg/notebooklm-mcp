I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BENITO H. LOPEZ, G.R. No. L-18007, March 30, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On December 6, 1950, Benito H. Lopez filed his income tax return for 1950. The BIR issued a deficiency assessment of P245,100.29 on November 13, 1952 [1]. Lopez requested a reconsideration, leading to a reduced assessment of P20,346.14 on May 29, 1954 [1]. After failing to pay despite promises to do so, Lopez requested a second reinvestigation on July 9, 1955, and a third on January 16, 1956 [1, 2]. The BIR granted the third request provided Lopez waived the statute of limitations [2]. Lopez executed a waiver but unilaterally imposed a deadline of December 31, 1957, for the government to finish the reinvestigation [2]. Ignoring this deadline, the BIR issued a final assessment on March 23, 1960 [2]. On August 13, 1960, the Republic filed a collection suit in the CFI of Baguio [2]. Lopez moved to dismiss, arguing the action had prescribed because the government failed to act by his December 31, 1957 deadline. The CFI dismissed the complaint [1, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the time limit fixed by the taxpayer in a waiver of the statute of limitations is binding on the government.
2. W/N the government's right to collect the tax has prescribed.
3. W/N the taxpayer can raise defenses against the validity of the assessment in the civil collection suit.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The fixing by a taxpayer of a prescriptive period in a waiver is without effect if it operates to reduce the time prescribed by law [4, 5]. It is doubtful that the Collector of Internal Revenue can validly agree to such a reduction to the detriment of the State, as it diminishes the opportunities for collecting taxes [5].

2. **NO.** The five-year prescriptive period under Section 332(c) of the Internal Revenue Code is counted from the last revised assessment resulting from a reinvestigation asked for by the taxpayer [6, 7]. Additionally, when a taxpayer demands a reinvestigation, the time employed in said reinvestigation must be deducted from the total period of limitation [6, 7]. Deducting the time consumed by Lopez's requests for reinvestigation (January 1956 to April 1960) from the period between the first revised assessment (May 1954) and the filing of the complaint (August 1960), less than five years had effectively elapsed against the government [8, 9].

3. **NO.** The remedy of a taxpayer who disagrees with a tax assessment is to appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals under Republic Act No. 1125 [4, 10]. Failure to appeal constitutes a waiver of defenses against the assessment and estops the taxpayer from subsequently raising objections to the assessment in court [4, 11].

The order of dismissal is **REVOKED** and **SET ASIDE**, and the records are remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Barrera, J., concurs in the result [12].
