I. CAPTION
**LEALDA ELECTRIC CO., INC. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE**, (G.R. Number and Date not provided in source), **Dizon, J.**

II. FACTS
In 1915, Julian M. Locsin Anson was granted a franchise under Act No. 2475 to operate an electric light and power plant in Albay [1]. The franchise was eventually transferred to petitioner Lealda Electric Co., Inc. in 1951 [1]. Article 8 of Act No. 2475 required the grantee to pay a franchise tax based on gross earnings at the same rate "as required of other existing franchises" [2], [3]. Historically, this rate was 2% [4]. However, on October 1, 1946, Republic Act No. 39 amended Section 259 of the National Internal Revenue Code, increasing the franchise tax to 5% [4]. The petitioner paid the increased rate but contended that it should only be liable for the original 2%, arguing that its franchise was a private contract that could not be altered by the Tax Code amendment [3]. The Court of Tax Appeals ruled against the petitioner [1], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is liable for the increased franchise tax rate of 5% under Section 259 of the Tax Code, as amended by R.A. No. 39.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, holding the petitioner liable for the 5% rate [5].

The Court reasoned that the petitioner's charter (Act No. 2475) did not specify a fixed tax rate but merely provided for payment of the rate imposed on other existing franchises [3]. Consequently, Section 259 of the Tax Code, as amended by R.A. No. 39, became the basic franchise tax law applicable to all charters that did not specify a rate [6], [7]. The Court further noted that petitioner’s charter contained an express provision allowing for its alteration or repeal by Congress [8]. Unlike the franchises in *Visayas Electric Company* and *Manila Railroad Company*, the petitioner's charter did not contain an "in lieu of all taxes" clause; thus, the petitioner cannot claim exemption from the higher rate, as tax exemptions are not presumed [9], [10].

**Decision affirmed.**
