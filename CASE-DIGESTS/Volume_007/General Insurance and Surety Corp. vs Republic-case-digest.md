I. CAPTION
GENERAL INSURANCE AND SURETY CORPORATION v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and CENTRAL LUZON EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION, INC., G.R. No. L-13873, January 31, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On May 15, 1954, Central Luzon Educational Foundation, Inc. (Principal) and General Insurance and Surety Corporation (Surety) posted a bond of P10,000.00 in favor of the Department of Education. The bond guaranteed the Foundation's compliance with all obligations, specifically including the payment of teacher salaries "past, present, and future." The bond stipulated that liability would expire on June 15, 1955, and required a 60-day notice for withdrawal.

At the time of execution, the Foundation was already indebted to two teachers, Remedios Laoag and H.B. Arandia. On June 25, 1954, the Surety notified the Department of its withdrawal. On July 11, 1956—over a year after the bond's stated expiration—the Republic filed a complaint for forfeiture of the bond due to the unpaid salaries.

The Surety argued that it was no longer liable because the bond had expired on June 15, 1955, and the action was time-barred by the 60-day notice provision. It also argued the bond was void for being contrary to public policy as the penalty (P10,000) far exceeded the actual debt (approx. P1,500), and that an extension of time granted by one teacher to the Foundation extinguished the guaranty. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of the Republic, declaring the bond forfeited. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision with modification regarding the indemnity reimbursement.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Surety is liable for obligations incurred during the bond's effectivity even if the action was filed after the bond's expiration date.
2. W/N the 60-day notice provision in the bond is a prescriptive period for filing actions.
3. W/N the bond is void for being contrary to public policy because the penal amount exceeds the actual damages.
4. W/N the extension of time granted by a teacher to the Foundation extinguished the Surety's liability.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the right of the Government to proceed against the bond accrued the moment the bond was executed, as the Foundation was already indebted to its teachers at that time. The expiration date of June 15, 1955, marked the end of the period during which *new* obligations would be guaranteed, not the deadline to file suit for existing liabilities. Since the action is based on a written contract, it prescribes in ten years pursuant to Article 1144, par. 1 of the Civil Code [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The 60-day notice provision is not a period of prescription for filing an action. It is merely a limitation on the right of the Surety to withdraw from the bond; the Surety must give notice 60 days in advance to effect a valid withdrawal. It does not bar the Government from filing suit after that period [3, 4].

3. **NO.** The bond is penal in nature, and there is nothing against public policy in forfeiting the full amount. Under Article 1226 of the Civil Code, in obligations with a penal clause, the penalty substitutes the indemnity for damages in case of non-compliance. The Government is entitled to recover the stipulated sum (P10,000) without proving damages, as the mere non-performance of the principal obligation gives rise to the right to the penalty [5-7].

4. **NO.** Article 2079 of the Civil Code, which extinguishes a guaranty if an extension is granted without the guarantor's consent, does not apply. The extension was granted by the teacher (Remedios Laoag), not by the creditor named in the bond (the Department of Education/Government). Furthermore, the Foundation was also in arrears to another teacher (Arandia) to whom no extension was granted, which alone suffices to forfeit the bond [8, 9].

**Disposition:** The decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
