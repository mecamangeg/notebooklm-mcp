**I. CAPTION**
*Araullo v. Monte de Piedad Savings Bank*, G.R. No. L-17840, April 23, 1963, 117 Phil. 658. (Note: G.R. Number, Date, and Citation are provided from external legal knowledge as they were not explicitly contained in the provided source text; the Ponente is not explicitly named in the source excerpts).

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Araullo filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) seeking reinstatement as an employee of respondent Monte de Piedad Savings Bank, alleging he was dismissed without just cause [1]. The respondent Bank was not charged with unfair labor practice, nor was the case certified by the President as involving an industry indispensable to the national interest [1]. The case also did not involve claims under the Minimum Wage Law or the Eight-Hour Labor Law [1]. The CIR apparently ruled against the petitioner (implied by the affirmation of the resolution appealed from), prompting this appeal to the Supreme Court [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations may hear and decide a petition for reinstatement of an employee alleged to be dismissed without just cause, absent any unfair labor practice or specific labor law violations. [1]

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) does not have jurisdiction over the case. For the CIR to have jurisdiction, the case must involve either: (1) a charge of unfair labor practice (Republic Act No. 875); (2) a labor dispute affecting an industry indispensable to the national interest certified by the President (Section 10, Republic Act No. 875); or (3) the operation of the Minimum Wage Law (Republic Act No. 602) or the Eight-Hour Labor Law (Commonwealth Act No. 444) [1].

None of these circumstances are present in the case at bar [1]. The Court distinguished this case from *Price Stabilization Corporation vs. CIR*, clarifying that the CIR's jurisdiction over reinstatement claims is grounded on claims arising out of the specific labor laws mentioned (Minimum Wage or Eight-Hour Labor Law), which are not involved here [3].

The resolution appealed from is **AFFIRMED**. [2]

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred. Justices Barrera and Labrador took no part. [2]
