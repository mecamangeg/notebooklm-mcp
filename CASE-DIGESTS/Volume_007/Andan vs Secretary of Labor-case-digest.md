I. CAPTION
JUAN ANDAN and ASUNCION CRUZ-ANDAN v. THE SECRETARY OF LABOR, JULIANO ESTRELLA, EUGENIO AGUIRRE, FERNANDO NAVARRO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18556, March 29, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Eugenio Aguirre, et al. filed criminal cases against petitioners Juan Andan and Asuncion Cruz-Andan for violations of the Minimum Wage Law and Eight-Hour Labor Law. Asuncion was convicted and fined, while Juan was acquitted. Subsequently, respondents filed a complaint for unpaid wages and overtime pay against petitioners with Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor. Petitioners moved to dismiss on grounds of *res judicata* and lack of jurisdiction, but the Hearing Officer denied the motion. The Regional Office rendered a decision ordering petitioners to pay P18,904.00 in unpaid wages/overtime and P1,890.00 in attorney's fees. Petitioners filed a petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan. The CFI dismissed the petition and dissolved the preliminary injunction it had previously issued. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor has jurisdiction to hear and try money claims for unpaid wages and overtime pay.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Regional Office No. 3 has no jurisdiction to hear and try the money claims filed by the respondents. The Supreme Court ruled that Section 25 of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, which grants regional offices of the Department of Labor original and exclusive jurisdiction over money claims, is null and void because it is not authorized by Republic Act No. 997, the act creating the Reorganization Commission. Citing *Corominas, Jr. v. Labor Standards Commission* and *Manila Central University v. Calupitan*, the Court reiterated that the Reorganization Commission was not empowered to grant such jurisdiction to the regional offices. Consequently, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the decisions and orders rendered by Regional Office No. 3 are set aside and declared **NULL AND VOID** [1, 5, 6].
