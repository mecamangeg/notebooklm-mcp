I. CAPTION
EMPLOYEES & LABORERS COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATION, DOMINGO BARTOLOME, EMILIO VISTA, RICARDO ALINEA and FELIPE BICOMONG v. NATIONAL UNION OF RESTAURANT WORKERS (PLUM), G.R. No. L-18697, February 28, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent National Union of Restaurant Workers (PLUM) filed a complaint for unfair labor practice against petitioner Employees & Laborers Cooperative Association and its managers in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). The Union alleged irregular salaries, employment of non-union men, and unjustified rotation and dismissal of employees [1]. The petitioners argued that the rotation and termination were caused by financial difficulties leading to the cooperative's dissolution [2].

The CIR ruled that petitioners did not commit unfair labor practices, finding that the rotation and termination were not discriminatory but the result of a legitimate closure of business due to financial losses [2]. However, the CIR ordered petitioners to pay the complainants separation pay equivalent to one-half month pay for every year of service, reasoning that while there was just cause, the petitioners failed to give the one-month advance notice required by Republic Act No. 1052, as amended by Republic Act No. 1787 [3]. Petitioners appealed this award of separation pay [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N employees dismissed due to the legitimate closure of business on account of financial losses are entitled to separation pay.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that when employment is terminated for a just cause, the employee is not entitled to separation pay [5].

Under Section 1 of Republic Act No. 1052, as amended by Republic Act No. 1787, an employer may terminate employment without a definite period *with* just cause at any time [6]. The Court noted that under the amended law, the closing of a business due to financial losses is explicitly recognized as a just cause [5, 7]. When termination is based on a just cause, the employer is not obligated to provide the one-month notice or the corresponding separation pay mandated for dismissals *without* just cause [8]. The legislative intent, as clarified in Senate deliberations, confirms that if a business closes due to bankruptcy or losses, it constitutes a just cause for termination without further recourse for separation pay [7].

Consequently, the writ of certiorari was granted, the order granting separation pay was set aside, and the complaint was dismissed [5, 9].
