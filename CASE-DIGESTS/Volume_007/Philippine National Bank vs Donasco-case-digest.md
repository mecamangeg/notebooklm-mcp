I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. SANTOS DONASCO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18638, February 28, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On February 22, 1952, Philippine National Bank (PNB) filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Surigao against Santos Donasco, et al. to recover the balance of a loan secured by a real estate mortgage [1, 2]. After multiple resets, the hearing was scheduled for September 17, 1958 [3]. PNB's counsel in Cebu received notice of this setting on September 2, 1958, but due to conflicting hearings in Cebu, they filed an urgent motion for postponement via air mail, setting the motion for hearing on September 6, 1958 [4]. PNB's counsel did not appear on the scheduled trial date, assuming the motion had been granted since they received no notice of its denial [4, 5]. Consequently, the trial court dismissed the case for failure to prosecute [3]. PNB moved for a new trial claiming excusable negligence, which the trial court denied [6, 7]. PNB appealed, and the Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved only questions of law [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N PNB’s failure to appear at trial due to a pending motion for postponement constitutes excusable negligence warranting a new trial.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that PNB's failure to appear was inexcusable [8]. Motions for postponement are addressed to the sound discretion of the court, and a movant has no right to assume the motion will be granted [9, 10]. It is the duty of the movant to be present in court on the day of the hearing so that if the motion is denied, they can proceed with the trial [9, 10]. The Court noted that PNB's counsel had no reason to assume the motion was granted simply because they did not receive notice of the court's action [8]. Additionally, the record showed no proof of service of the motion upon the defendants, a violation of Rule 26, Section 6, which dictates that no motion shall be acted upon without such proof [5, 11].

The order dismissing the complaint is affirmed [8].
