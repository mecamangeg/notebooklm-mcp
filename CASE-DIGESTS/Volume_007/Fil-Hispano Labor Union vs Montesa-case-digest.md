I. CAPTION
FIL-HISPANO LABOR UNION, ET AL. v. THE HON. JUDGE AGUSTIN P. MONTESA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18371, April 23, 1963.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, Fil-Hispano Labor Union and its officers, filed a charge of unfair labor practice (ULP) with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against respondent Fil-Hispano Ceramics, Inc. for the company’s refusal to turn over check-off dues [1]. Two days later, the respondents filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan seeking to restrain the petitioners from interfering with employees entering the factory [1, 2]. Respondent Judge Montesa issued an *ex-parte* writ of preliminary injunction against the petitioners on the same day [2]. Petitioners filed this action alleging the respondent Judge acted without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, arguing the case falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the CIR due to the pending ULP charge, and that the injunction failed to comply with the requirements of the Industrial Peace Act [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to issue a writ of preliminary injunction in a case involving a labor dispute intimately related to a pending unfair labor practice charge in the Court of Industrial Relations.
2. W/N the issuance of the *ex-parte* writ of preliminary injunction was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the issuance of the writ was done without jurisdiction. Since the petitioners had filed a ULP charge with the CIR two days prior to the CFI complaint, the CIR acquired jurisdiction over the case to the exclusion of the CFI [1]. The cause of action alleged in the CFI was intimately related to the charge of unfair labor practice, rendering the regular court powerless to enjoin the acts complained of [1, 3].

2. **NO.** Even assuming the CFI had jurisdiction, the case clearly involved a labor dispute [4]. Under Section 9(d) of Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act), a court cannot issue a temporary or permanent injunction without a hearing, testimonial evidence, and a specific finding of facts (e.g., unlawful acts threatened, irreparable injury, lack of adequate remedy) [4-6]. The respondent Judge failed to comply with these requisites by issuing the writ *ex-parte* [3, 7].

The petition is **GRANTED**; the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the respondent Judge is **ANNULLED**. [7]
