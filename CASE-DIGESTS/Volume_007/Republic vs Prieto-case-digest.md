I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES (Represented by the Land Tenure Administration) v. ANTONIO PRIETO, MAURO PRIETO, CARMEN PRIETO DE CASTRO, and RAMON CARO, G.R. Nos. L-17946 & L-18042, April 30, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
The Republic, through the Land Tenure Administration, filed two complaints in 1957 to expropriate parcels of land in Sampaloc, Manila, owned by the defendants (Prietos), alleging they formerly formed part of the Legarda/Prieto Estates [1, 2]. The actions were filed pursuant to Republic Act (RA) No. 1162, as amended by RA 1599 [1]. The defendants filed motions to dismiss, arguing, among others, that there was no appropriation of funds for the purpose and that the properties were subdivision lots, not "landed estates," and thus not subject to expropriation under the Constitution and prevailing jurisprudence [3, 4].

The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaints [4]. It ruled that the properties were not "landed estates" with extensive areas, a finding of fact binding on the Supreme Court [4]. It further held that Congress cannot abrogate Supreme Court decisions defining "landed estates" by simply amending the law to include lands that "formerly formed part thereof" [5]. The Republic appealed. During the pendency of the appeal, RA 2342 was enacted in 1959, extending expropriation to lands which formerly formed part of landed estates, provided they have at least 50 tenant houses [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal of the complaints for failure to allege the availability of funds was proper.
2. W/N RA 2342 can be applied retroactively to validate the expropriation of the subject properties.
3. W/N the subject properties meet the statutory requirements for expropriation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 2 of RA 1990 (the law in force at the time) authorized the Solicitor General to institute expropriation proceedings only "immediately upon the availability of the necessary funds by the Congress." The complaints failed to allege that funds were available [7, 8]. The provision in Section 8 of RA 1162 merely "authorized to be appropriated" 15 million pesos; this constitutes only an authority to appropriate in the future, not an actual appropriation [8, 9]. Non-compliance with this condition precedent justified the dismissal [7, 10].

2. **NO.** The authority at the time of filing under RA 1990 was limited to "landed estates" [10]. The trial court found the properties were not landed estates. Although RA 2342 later extended expropriation to lands "formerly forming part" of estates, this law affects substantive rights and cannot be given retroactive effect to validate complaints that lacked a cause of action when filed, especially absent a provision for retroactivity [9, 11].

3. **NO.** Even if RA 2342 were applied, the specific condition *sine qua non* that the land must have "at least 50 houses of tenants erected thereon" was not met [9, 12]. The evidence showed the properties consisted of separate, non-contiguous parcels, none of which individually contained at least 50 tenant houses [13, 14]. Without this basic fact established, the lands are not expropriable [14].

Decisions affirmed.
