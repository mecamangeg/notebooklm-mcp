I. CAPTION
INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL, AGRICULTURAL WORKERS ORGANIZATION (ICAWO) v. BAUTISTA, G.R. No. L-15639, April 30, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Martha Enterprises, Inc. operated the Bulingan Logging Camp. Due to Bureau of Forestry restrictions, rugged terrain, and economic losses, the company decided to lay off laborers in September 1954 and eventually closed the camp on October 15, 1954 [1-3]. On the same day the camp closed, the company signed a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with the "Knights of Labor" union, which contained a closed-shop proviso [4].

On November 3, 1954, the company resumed operations. Members of the petitioner union (ICAWO) applied for re-employment but were refused because they were not members of the Knights of Labor, in accordance with the closed-shop agreement [4]. ICAWO filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice. The CIR trial judge ruled in favor of ICAWO, finding the dismissal illegal. However, the CIR *en banc* reversed this decision, finding the closure was for valid economic reasons and not due to union activities, as ICAWO was organized after the decision to lay off was made [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the application of the closed-shop agreement to the laid-off employees upon their application for re-employment constitutes illegal discrimination.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR *en banc*. The Court held that the CIR's factual findings regarding the validity of the closure due to economic reasons were supported by substantial evidence and thus conclusive [5].

Since the closure of the camp and the layoff of employees were for valid reasons, the employment relationship was effectively terminated. When the camp reopened on November 3, 1954, the former employees stood on "equal footing" with any other persons applying for employment [7, 8]. While a closed-shop agreement cannot apply to current employees belonging to a minority union (*Freeman Shirt Mfg. Co. v. CIR*), it validly applies to persons to be hired [7]. Because the ICAWO members were validly separated from service, they were treated as new applicants subject to the closed-shop proviso valid under Sec. 4(a) of the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. 875) [9]. The resolution of the CIR is affirmed [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Barrera, J. (Dissenting):** Concurred in by Concepcion, J. Argued that the temporary closing and signing of the closed-shop CBA on the exact same date (Oct. 15), followed by reopening only 19 days later, indicated bad faith. He believed the closure was a sham designed to purge employees who refused to join the Knights of Labor [10].
