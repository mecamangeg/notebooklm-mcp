I. CAPTION
TAN KIM KEE v. THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18080, April 22, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tan Kim Kee is a copra producer in Davao City utilizing both sun-dried and kiln-dried methods. These processes involve un-husking coconuts (for kiln-drying), splitting the nuts, removing the meat, chopping it, and drying it to reduce moisture [1-3]. For the period of August 24, 1956 to December 31, 1956, Petitioner paid P1,254.24 in 7% sales tax and fixed taxes pursuant to Republic Act No. 1612 [3]. Petitioner filed a claim for refund, arguing that copra is an agricultural product in its original form and thus exempt from tax. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) denied the refund, holding that under R.A. No. 1612, the exemption for agricultural products was restricted to those in their "original form," and the processing of coconut into copra constituted "manufacturing" [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the production of copra constitutes "manufacturing" under Republic Act No. 1612, thereby subjecting it to sales tax.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's decision. Under Section 188(b) of the Tax Code as amended by R.A. No. 1612, the exemption for agricultural products was limited to those "in their original form," specifically deleting the phrase "whether in their original state or not" found in the prior law [5, 6]. The Court held that the processes of un-husking, splitting, removing meat, and drying alter the exterior texture and form of the coconut, falling under the definition of "manufacturing" in Section 194(x) of the Tax Code [4, 7].

The legislative intent of R.A. No. 1612 was to restrict the exemption and increase revenue [8]. The fact that Congress later enacted R.A. No. 1856 to restore the phrase "whether in their original form or not" confirms that the exemption was indeed withdrawn during the effectivity of R.A. No. 1612 [9]. Consequently, Petitioner was liable for the tax during the contested period.

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
