**I. CAPTION**
JOSEPH REICH v. EDMUND SCHWESINGER and the COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-16525, January 31, 1963, Dizon, J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
In 1937, Petitioner Reich (a British subject) executed two promissory notes in favor of Respondent Schwesinger (a Filipino citizen): one for P4,500 dated February 1, 1937, and another for P4,000 dated October 1, 1937 [3]. Both notes were payable on demand [4]. Reich failed to pay despite repeated demands [4]. Schwesinger filed a complaint for collection on June 21, 1955 [5]. The lower courts ruled in favor of Schwesinger, holding that the ten-year prescriptive period was interrupted by the Moratorium Law (May 1945–May 1953) and the outbreak of World War II (December 8, 1941) [5]. Reich appealed, arguing that the war did not suspend the running of the prescriptive period because Schwesinger, as a Filipino citizen, was free to sue Reich, an interned alien [6, 7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the running of the prescriptive period was suspended during World War II regarding a Filipino creditor's claim against an interned enemy alien debtor. [6, 7]

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The statutes of limitations were suspended upon the outbreak of World War II regarding interned aliens [1]. The Court relied on *Montilla v. Pacific Commercial Co.*, noting that Japanese Military Administration Instruction No. 28 suspended court actions "affecting" enemy aliens, not just those initiated by them [7, 8]. Although the Instruction allowed actions if expressly authorized by military authorities, the Court took judicial notice that seeking such authority was "most difficult, if not fraught with danger to life and security" [8, 9]. It would be unfair to compel a creditor to enforce rights against a helpless, interned debtor whose properties were likely confiscated, or to risk danger by seeking Japanese permission [9]. Consequently, the action filed in 1955 was not barred by prescription.

The decision appealed from is affirmed. [10]
