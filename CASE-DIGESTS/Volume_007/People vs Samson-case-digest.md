I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JOSEFINA N. SAMSON, G.R. No. L-14110, March 29, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On the morning of October 13, 1954, in Libon, Albay, Josefina N. Samson shot her husband, Jose V. Samson, twice with a carbine. She immediately surrendered to the Chief of Police and admitted the shooting. At trial, however, she claimed the shooting was accidental. She alleged that after a quarrel where her husband threatened to kill her for refusing to give him more money, he raised the carbine to strike her. She claimed she grappled for the gun, and it went off during the scuffle.

The medical findings revealed one bullet wound entering the nape of the neck projecting downwards, and another in the interscapular region projecting upwards. There were no powder burns on the victim. The trial court (CFI Albay) found the physical evidence inconsistent with her theory of a scuffle, convicted her of Parricide, and sentenced her to *reclusion perpetua* with an order to indemnify the heirs P6,000.00. Josefina appealed, questioning the evidence of the shooting, the proof of marriage, and the award of civil damages.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the shooting was accidental.
2. W/N the existence of marriage was sufficiently proven to sustain a conviction for Parricide.
3. W/N the trial court erred in awarding civil damages when the right to civil action was allegedly not reserved.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court rejected the defense of accidental shooting. The physical evidence contradicted the appellant's version of events. The absence of powder burns at the entrance wounds proved the victim was shot from a distance, not with the muzzle almost resting on his body as would happen in a scuffle [1]. Furthermore, the trajectories of the bullets were inconsistent with a struggle, and it was deemed physically impossible for the frail appellant to wrestle the carbine from her robust husband [2].

2. **YES.** The Court held that there is no better proof of marriage in a parricide case than the admission by the accused of the existence of such marriage. The appellant admitted in her testimony that the deceased was her husband and that they had five children [3, 4].

3. **NO.** (The trial court did not err; the award was proper). Under Section 1(a) of Rule 107 (now Rule 111), the reservation to institute a separate civil action must be made by the offended party. In this case, the offended parties were the minor children of the deceased. Since neither they nor a guardian made such a reservation, the trial court correctly included civil liability in the judgment [5, 6].

The Court affirmed the judgment, appreciating the mitigating circumstances of voluntary surrender and passion or obfuscation to impose the minimum penalty of *reclusion perpetua* [7].
