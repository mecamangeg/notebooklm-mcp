I. CAPTION
RUBEN L. VALERO and ESTRELLA L. DE VALERO v. THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION and DIOSDADO RODRIGUEZ, G.R. No. L-19532, March 30, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Ruben and Estrella Valero applied for a certificate of public convenience (CPC) to operate a 5-ton ice plant in Olongapo, Zambales [1]. They complied with the Public Service Commission’s (PSC) order to publish the application and notify parties listed by the PSC [1]. No opposition was filed, and the PSC granted the application in a decision received by petitioners on May 26, 1960 [2].

On June 21, 1960, within the 30-day period before the decision became final, respondent Diosdado Rodriguez filed a petition to set aside the decision and reopen the case [2, 3]. Rodriguez claimed he was an affected party—operating a 10-ton ice plant in San Marcelino that served Olongapo—who was not notified of the proceedings [2, 3]. Petitioners opposed, arguing Rodriguez was not on the PSC's list and questioned his authority to serve Olongapo, which they claimed was a U.S. Naval Reservation outside PSC jurisdiction [3, 4].

The PSC found that Rodriguez was an affected party authorized to serve Olongapo and ordered the previous decision set aside and the case reopened for a new hearing [5, 6]. Petitioners appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission properly set aside its decision to reopen the case for an affected party who was not notified of the proceedings.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of the Commission. The Court held that the reopening of the case to allow an affected party, who was not properly notified of the application, to present his opposition is within the scope of the Commission’s authority [7].

Although the petitioners' failure to notify the oppositor was not due to their own fault (as his name was not on the list furnished by the Commission), this does not alter the fact that an affected party was deprived of his day in court [6, 7]. Since the motion to set aside was filed before the decision became final, the Commission's action to give the aggrieved party an opportunity to be heard was the proper step [7]. The Court further noted that the Commission is empowered by law to amend, modify, or revoke a certificate at any time if facts are found to be misrepresented [7].

The petition was denied [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred; Justice Labrador took no part) [9].
