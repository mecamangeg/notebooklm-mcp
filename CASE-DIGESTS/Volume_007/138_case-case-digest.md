I. CAPTION
*Trusteeship of the Minors Perez y Tuason; Araneta v. Perez*, G.R. No. L-16187, April 30, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Trustee J. Antonio Araneta filed a motion for clarification of the Supreme Court's decision dated February 27, 1963, seeking to confirm that the decision referred only to future attorney's fees and did not disturb the trustee's management fees. Judicial Guardian Antonio Perez opposed the motion. Previously, in Special Proceedings No. Q-73, the parties entered into a compromise agreement setting the trustee's fees at 10% of collected rents and 5% of the sale of properties. This compromise was approved by the trial court in 1955 and affirmed by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-11788 in 1958, becoming final. Perez had previously agreed to deductions based on this schedule.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the compromise agreement regarding the trustee's management fees constitutes *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Under Article 2038 of the Civil Code, a compromise, once approved by final orders of the court, has the force of *res judicata* between the parties and cannot be disturbed except for vices of consent or forgery, neither of which were shown [1, 2]. The obvious purpose of the compromise was to settle the measure of compensation once and for all and bar future disputes [2]. The Court resolved that its February 27, 1963 decision did not modify the binding effect of the compromise agreement regarding the trustee's management fees [3]. The decision was clarified and affirmed.
