I. CAPTION
LUNETA MOTOR COMPANY v. ANTONIO MENENDEZ and CARLOS BARANDA, and LUZON SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-16880, April 30, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Antonio Menendez obtained a loan from Luneta Motor Co. secured by a chattel mortgage on a car. Upon default, Luneta Motor filed for foreclosure and replevin. The car was seized but subsequently returned to co-defendant Carlos Baranda after he posted a counterbond subscribed by Luzon Surety Co., Inc. The Court of First Instance (CFI) rendered judgment ordering Menendez and Baranda to deliver the car or satisfy the debt via the counterbond, but Luzon Surety was not furnished a copy of this decision. Baranda appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the decision *in toto*.

Pending the finality of the CA decision, Luneta Motor filed a claim for damages against Luzon Surety with the *trial court*. The CA decision became final and executory on September 2, 1959, without including an award against the surety. The records were remanded later, and the trial court subsequently heard the claim and ordered Luzon Surety to pay damages. Luzon Surety appealed, questioning the jurisdiction and procedure.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the surety can be held liable for damages on the counterbond when the award was not included in the final judgment of the main case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court declared the order null and void and set it aside. Under Section 10, Rule 62 and Section 20, Rule 59 of the Rules of Court, recovery on a replevin bond requires strict compliance with three requisites: (1) the application for damages must be filed before trial or before entry of final judgment; (2) due notice must be given to the surety; and (3) there must be a proper hearing and the award of damages, if any, must be included in the final judgment [1-3].

Although Luneta Motor filed its application before the judgment became final, the award was not included in the final decision of the Court of Appeals [3]. The Court held that it is the claimant's duty to ensure the award against the surety is included in the final judgment to avoid separate judgments for a solidary obligation [4, 5]. Furthermore, filing the claim in the trial court while the case was pending appeal was improper without express permission from the appellate court [6]. Since the main judgment became final without incorporating the award against the surety, the trial court's subsequent order was void [7, 8].
