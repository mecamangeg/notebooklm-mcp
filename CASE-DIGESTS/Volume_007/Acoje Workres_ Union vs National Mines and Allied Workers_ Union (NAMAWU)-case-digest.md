I. CAPTION
ACOJE WORKERS' UNION v. NATIONAL MINES AND ALLIED WORKERS' UNION (NAMAWU), ACOJE MINES COMPANY and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-18848, April 23, 1963, Concepcion, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On June 9, 1961, the Department of Labor conducted a consent election among the workers of Acoje Mining Company to determine their bargaining representative [3]. Respondent NAMAWU obtained 560 votes while petitioner Acoje Workers' Union obtained 278 votes out of 874 valid votes cast [4, 5]. Petitioner filed a motion to invalidate the election, alleging that the voter list included ineligible employees and that the election was marred by terrorism, force, and intimidation [5, 6]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) denied the motion and certified NAMAWU as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent [5]. After the CIR *en banc* denied its motion for reconsideration, petitioner appealed by *certiorari*, claiming the election should be invalidated due to the alleged irregularities [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the certification election should be invalidated due to alleged errors in the voter list and acts of terrorism/coercion. [5, 6]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of the Court of Industrial Relations [7].

Regarding the voter list, the Court held that the petitioner could no longer contest its accuracy because the unions had agreed to use the company payroll as the basis for the list [1]. Petitioner was given the opportunity to object to the list in the lower court but failed to do so, effectively waiving the right to question it on appeal [1].

Regarding the alleged coercion, the Court ruled that a general allegation that workers were threatened or intimidated, without indicating the specific number of workers involved, submitting supporting affidavits, or offering testimony, is clearly insufficient to invalidate the election [6, 8]. Furthermore, the claim of disorder was refuted by the minutes of the election, which recorded that the balloting was peaceful and maintained by the Provincial Commander [7, 9].

The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the petitioner [7].
