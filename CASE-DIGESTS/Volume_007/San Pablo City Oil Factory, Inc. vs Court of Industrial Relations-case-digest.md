I. CAPTION
SAN PABLO OIL FACTORY, INC. and WERNER P. SCHETELIG v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and KAPATIRANG MANGGAGAWA ASSOCIATION (NLU), G.R. No. L-18270, April 30, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
The Kapatirang Manggagawa Association (Union) and San Pablo Oil Factory, Inc. (Company) failed to renew their collective bargaining agreement, leading to a strike and a subsequent lockout by the Company on May 27, 1957. The Union filed a complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP) with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). The CIR *en banc* issued a resolution on October 29, 1958, reversing the trial judge's dismissal and finding the Company guilty of ULP, but it made no pronouncement regarding back wages.

Although the resolution was dated October 29, 1958, the parties only received notice of it on July 1, 1959. Five days later, on July 6, 1959, the Union filed a motion praying for back wages. The CIR granted this motion on March 16, 1961. The Company appealed, arguing the October 29, 1958 resolution had become final and the CIR lost jurisdiction to amend it. The Supreme Court initially reversed the CIR in a November 1962 decision, believing the motion was late. The Union moved for reconsideration, proving the actual date of receipt of the notice.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR had jurisdiction to amend its resolution to award back wages based on a motion filed months after the resolution's date but shortly after notice was served.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court amended its previous decision and affirmed the CIR's resolution awarding back wages. The Court found that while the CIR resolution was dated October 29, 1958, the parties were served with notice only on July 1, 1959. Consequently, the Union's motion for back wages filed on July 6, 1959—merely five days after notice—was well within the reglementary period for filing a motion for reconsideration.

The Court held that the motion for back wages was, in legal effect, a motion to reconsider, amend, or complete the original resolution. The original resolution was incomplete because, having found the Company guilty of ULP, the CIR should have awarded back wages to the victims of the lockout as mandated by Section 15 of Act No. 875. Since the motion was timely, the CIR retained control and jurisdiction to amend its resolution and award the back wages.

The Supreme Court's decision promulgated on November 28, 1962, was amended, and the resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations was affirmed.
