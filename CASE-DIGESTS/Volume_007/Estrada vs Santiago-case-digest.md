I. CAPTION
LUDOVICO ESTRADA, ET AL. v. HON. AMADO S. SANTIAGO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15665, March 29, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In Civil Case No. 10394, the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan ruled in favor of Pindangan Agricultural Co., Inc., declaring it entitled to possess a parcel of land and issuing a permanent injunction against unauthorized entry [1, 2]. Petitioners Estrada, et al. appealed the decision. While the appeal was being perfected, Pindangan requested immediate execution, which respondent Judge Santiago granted in an order dated June 18, 1958 [2, 3]. Petitioners challenged this execution order in a separate certiorari petition (G.R. No. L-14180) [3]. Subsequently, Pindangan filed a motion for contempt against petitioners for allegedly re-entering the land and cultivating it in violation of the June 18 execution order [4]. The respondent Judge issued an order requiring petitioners to explain why they should not be punished for contempt [5]. Petitioners then filed the present petition, arguing, among other things, that the trial court lost jurisdiction to act on the contempt motion due to the perfected appeal [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners may be held in contempt of court for disobeying the order of immediate execution.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the contempt proceedings could not continue. The Court took judicial notice that the related cases had been decided against the private respondent: in G.R. No. L-14180, the Court held that the order of immediate execution had been "improvidently issued," and in the main appeal (G.R. No. L-14591), it was held that the corporation had no legal right to the possession of the land [7]. The Court applied the principle that persons "could not be punished for disobeying orders found to be without sufficient legal foundation" [7]. Consequently, the petition was granted, and the preliminary injunction preventing the respondent judge from continuing with the contempt proceeding was made permanent [8].
