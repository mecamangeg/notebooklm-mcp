I. CAPTION
DELFIN MONTANO v. JOSE LIM ANG, ET AL., G.R. No. L-13057, February 27, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Delfin Montano sold a Cadillac car to Spouses Jose Lim Ang and Teodora Gonzales for P28,000.00. The spouses paid a portion of the price and executed a promissory note for the balance, secured by a chattel mortgage on the car. Montano registered the mortgage with the Register of Deeds but failed to notify the Motor Vehicles Office (MVO) as required by Section 5(e) of the Revised Motor Vehicle Law (Act No. 3992). Subsequently, Lim Ang transferred the car's registration to Eugenio Villanueva, who sold it to Amador Santos, who then sold it to Manila Trading & Supply Co., which finally sold it to Angel Tinio. Tinio, unaware of the previous mortgage, registered the car and his own mortgage with the MVO. When Lim Ang failed to pay, Montano filed a replevin suit to recover the car from Tinio. The lower court ruled in favor of Montano, prompting a series of third-party complaints for reimbursement among the successive buyers. The case was certified to the Supreme Court on questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the chattel mortgage is valid between the parties even if executed before the car’s registration was transferred to the mortgagors.
2. W/N the chattel mortgage is binding on third persons despite the failure to record it in the Motor Vehicles Office.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The mortgage is valid between the parties. The contract of sale was perfected upon agreement on the car and price, and consummated upon partial payment and delivery. The mortgagors were already the owners when they executed the mortgage [1, 2]. The registration of the transfer in the MVO is merely an administrative proceeding which does not bear any essential relation to the validity of the contract of sale between the parties [3, 4].

2. **NO.** To affect third persons, a chattel mortgage of a car must not only be registered in the Chattel Mortgage Registry but must also be recorded in the Motor Vehicles Office pursuant to Section 5(e) of the Revised Motor Vehicle Law [3]. Since Montano failed to notify the MVO, his mortgage did not bind the subsequent purchaser, Angel Tinio, who acted in good faith. Consequently, Montano cannot recover the car from Tinio.

The decision is **AFFIRMED** insofar as it orders Spouses Lim Ang to pay Montano the unpaid balance, but **REVERSED** regarding the recovery of the car and the liability of the third parties.
