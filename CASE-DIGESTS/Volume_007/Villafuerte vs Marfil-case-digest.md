I. CAPTION
JAIME VILLAFUERTE vs. ELIAS T. MARFIL, Deputy Sheriff of Quezon City, JULIAN E. ESTELLA, Hearing Officer of Regional Office 3, Department of Labor and GORGONIA QUIJANO, G.R. No. L-17775, February 28, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On September 7, 1959, respondent Gorgonia Quijano filed a complaint against petitioner Jaime Villafuerte at Regional Office 3 of the Department of Labor for unpaid wages amounting to P332.00 [1, 2]. During the proceedings, Hearing Officer Julian E. Estella declared Villafuerte in default for failing to attend a hearing and subsequently rendered judgment ordering him to pay the claim [2]. Villafuerte’s motions to set aside the default and for relief were denied, and a writ of execution was issued [2, 3]. Villafuerte then filed a petition for injunction with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, questioning the jurisdiction of the labor officials. The CFI rendered judgment declaring the Hearing Officer’s decision null and void and enjoined the execution [3]. The respondents appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, which grants regional offices of the Department of Labor jurisdiction over money claims, is valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the decision of the CFI, ruling that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is null and void insofar as it grants original and exclusive jurisdiction to regional offices of the Department of Labor to hear and decide money claims of laborers, such as unpaid wages [4, 5]. Citing settled jurisprudence in *Corominas, Jr. v. Labor Standards Commission*, *De Vera v. Supitran*, and *Davao Far Eastern Commercial Co. v. Montemayor*, the Court held that the provision (specifically Section 25) granting such judicial powers to labor officials is invalid [4, 5]. The judgment appealed from is affirmed [4].
