I. CAPTION
STERLING PRODUCTS INTERNATIONAL, INC. and V. SAN PEDRO v. LORETA C. SOL and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-19187, February 28, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Loreta C. Sol was a regular radio monitor for petitioner Sterling Products International, Inc. She was directed to listen to specific broadcasts at designated stations, hours, and days, and submit reports accordingly [1, 2]. On January 8, 1960, Sol filed a complaint against petitioners for underpayment and money claims (vacation leave and Christmas bonus). Subsequently, petitioners dismissed her on December 16, 1960 [3].

Petitioners claimed Sol was an independent contractor whose services were no longer required due to business reasons [4]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) initially held Sol was an independent contractor and her dismissal was justified. However, upon Sol's motion for reconsideration, the CIR en banc reversed the ruling, declaring Sol an employee based on the company's control over her work, her identification card, and privileges. The CIR ordered her reinstatement with backwages, finding petitioners guilty of Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) [5-8]. Petitioners appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N respondent Sol is an employee of the petitioners.
2. W/N the petitioners are guilty of Unfair Labor Practice (ULP).
3. W/N respondent Sol is entitled to separation pay.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that Sol was an employee, not an independent contractor. Petitioners exercised control not only over the result but also the means and methods of her work by prescribing what, when, and how she should listen to broadcasts [7]. The Court held that the absence of direct physical supervision while performing duties does not render one an independent contractor if they are working under specific instructions [2]. Furthermore, Sol's claim for vacation leave and bonuses was inconsistent with the status of an independent contractor [9].

2. **NO.** The Court found the contention that petitioners committed Ufair Labor Practice to be unfounded. Under Section 4 of the Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act No. 875), ULP involves acts against employees regarding their right to self-organization. Since Sol was not a member of any labor union and had not attempted to join or assist one, her dismissal did not constitute ULP [9-11].

3. **YES.** The employment contract allowing dismissal on 15 days' notice was declared null and void for being contrary to Republic Act No. 1787 (Termination Pay Law). Under this law, in the absence of a fixed term, an employer must provide one month's notice or separation pay equivalent to one-half month for every year of service [11, 12]. Since Sol served for seven years (1952-1959), she is entitled to three and one-half months' pay [13].

**Decision affirmed with modification.** (The finding of ULP was reversed, but the award was modified to separation pay under RA 1787 instead of reinstatement).
