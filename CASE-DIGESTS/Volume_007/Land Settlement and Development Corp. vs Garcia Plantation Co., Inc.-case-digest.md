I. CAPTION
LAND SETTLEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION v. GARCIA PLANTATION CO., INC., SALUD GARCIA and VICENTE B. GARCIA, G.R. No. L-17820, April 24, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Land Settlement and Development Corp. (LASEDECO) filed a collection suit against respondents Garcia Plantation Co., Inc. and spouses Garcia for the unpaid balance of two tractors. Respondents admitted the debt but moved to dismiss, claiming the action filed on February 20, 1957 was premature. They presented a letter (Exhibit L) from LASEDECO's manager granting an extension to pay until May 31, 1957. LASEDECO admitted the letter's existence but argued it failed to express the true intent of the parties, specifically that the extension was subject to a condition precedent that respondents make a substantial down payment. During trial, LASEDECO attempted to present parol evidence (testimonies of the manager and legal officer) to prove this condition. The Court of First Instance of Manila excluded the evidence under the Parol Evidence Rule (Rule 123, Sec. 22), holding that the writing was the sole evidence of the agreement. Consequently, the lower court dismissed the complaint as premature.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N parol evidence is admissible to prove a condition precedent to the effectivity of a written extension agreement.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the dismissal. The Court held that parol evidence is admissible when the operation of a written contract is made to depend upon the occurrence of an event acting as a condition precedent. The Parol Evidence Rule does not preclude the introduction of extrinsic evidence to show that a supposed contract never became effective by reason of the failure of some collateral condition or stipulation (*Peabody & Co. v. Bromfield & Ross*).

Here, the letter (Exhibit L) explicitly referred to a "subject of agreement" in its text, justifying the admission of evidence regarding surrounding circumstances to ascertain the true intent of the parties. Had the trial court admitted the evidence, LASEDECO could have proven that the extension never became effective due to the failure of the respondents to pay the down payment, thereby negating the claim that the action was premature.

The decision appealed from is REVERSED, and the case REMANDED to the lower court for further proceedings.
