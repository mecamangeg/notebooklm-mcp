I. CAPTION
JUSTO TAN alias LI SUI v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16013, March 30, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Justo Tan, born in the Philippines in 1926, filed a petition for naturalization in 1958 [1]. He did not file a declaration of intention, claiming exemption based on continuous residence in the Philippines for more than 30 years [2]. However, Tan left for China in 1941 for a vacation and only returned in January 1948, resulting in an absence of approximately eight years [1]. The Court of First Instance of Quezon granted his petition [2]. The Republic appealed, arguing that Tan’s absence interrupted the required continuous residence for exemption [2]. Additionally, Tan’s combined annual income with his wife was only P6,300, and he had testified to residing solely in Quezon since 1948 despite documents showing Manila addresses [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a declaration of intention based on 30 years of continuous residence.
2. W/N the petitioner satisfies the lucrative income requirement.
3. W/N the petitioner possesses irreproachable conduct.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The "continuous residence" required by Section 6 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 (as amended) to exempt an applicant from filing a declaration of intention refers to actual and substantial residence, not merely legal residence [5, 6]. By deducting Tan’s eight-year stay in China (1941–1948) from the period between his birth and the filing of the petition, he falls short of the required 30-year period [1].

2. **NO.** The petitioner’s personal annual income of P3,000, or a total of P6,300 when combined with his wife's income, is not considered lucrative [7]. This amount is insufficient considering they have a child to support and the high cost of living [3, 7].

3. **NO.** The petitioner testified falsely that he had not left Quezon Province since 1948, yet his 1956 marriage contract and 1948 immigrant certificate indicated his residence was in Manila [3, 4]. This untruthfulness demonstrates that he does not possess the irreproachable conduct required by law to become a naturalized citizen [3, 4].

The decree is reversed and the petition for naturalization is denied [8].
