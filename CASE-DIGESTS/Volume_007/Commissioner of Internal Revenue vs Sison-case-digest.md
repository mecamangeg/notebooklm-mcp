I. CAPTION
THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. CARLOS MORAN SISON and PRISCILA F. SISON, G.R. No. L-13739, April 30, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On February 28, 1949, respondents Carlos and Priscila Sison assigned real properties to Priscila Estate Inc. in exchange for shares of stock. They claimed deductible losses from this transaction in their 1949 income tax return [1]. The Bureau of Internal Revenue investigated and, on June 23, 1952, issued a deficiency income tax assessment of P41,101.83, alleging a taxable gain [2]. The respondents contested the assessment and requested a reinvestigation [2]. Consequently, an amended assessment was issued on October 13, 1956, reducing the amount to P5,535.02 [2]. The respondents protested, arguing that the government’s right to assess and collect had prescribed under the five-year limitation in Section 331 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as more than five years had passed since the 1949 return [2, 3]. The Court of Tax Appeals ruled in favor of the respondents, holding that the tax liability had prescribed [2, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the five-year prescriptive period to assess and collect the tax was suspended by the taxpayers' request for reinvestigation.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the taxpayer’s petition for reconsideration or reinvestigation stops the running of the five-year limitation period [5]. Citing *Querol vs. Collector of Internal Revenue* and *Republic vs. Lopez*, the Court established that the time employed in reinvestigating should be deducted from the total period of limitation [5, 6]. Alternatively, the prescriptive period is to be counted from the last revised assessment resulting from the reinvestigation requested by the taxpayer [6]. Since the delay from June 1952 to October 1956 was due to the respondents' own request for reinvestigation, that period must be excluded from the computation. Therefore, the amended assessment of October 1956 was enforceable. The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **REVERSED** [6, 7].
