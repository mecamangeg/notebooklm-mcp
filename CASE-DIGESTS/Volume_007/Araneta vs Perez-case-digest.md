I. CAPTION
TRUSTEESHIP OF THE MINORS BENIGNO, ANGELA & ANTONIO PEREZ Y TUASON; J. ANTONIO ARANETA v. ANTONIO PEREZ, G.R. No. L-16187, February 27, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On December 5, 1955, the Court of First Instance issued an order approving a compromise agreement between J. Antonio Araneta (trustee) and Antonio Perez (judicial guardian) regarding the trustee's fees and attorney's fees [1]. Perez filed a petition for relief from this order, seeking to reduce the fees and claiming overpayment, but the petition was denied by the lower court and affirmed by the Supreme Court in a previous case (G.R. No. L-11788) [2]. Perez subsequently pressed for the resolution of a motion to modify the 1955 order, asking that future trustee fees be limited to rates charged by trust companies and that the trustee be barred from collecting future attorney's fees [2, 3]. The lower court denied the motion, ruling that the matters were already covered by the final order of December 5, 1955 [4, 5]. Perez appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trustee's fees fixed in the final order of December 5, 1955 may be challenged or modified.
2. W/N the reasonableness of the trustee's future fees may be determined in advance.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The fees set in the compromise were approved by the lower court in an order that is already final and affirmed by the Supreme Court [5]. The parties are bound by the order not only as to the points actually adjudicated but also as to any claim or issue that could have been raised prior to the adjudication [6]. The argument that the trustee was overpaid is rejected as a subtle attempt to undermine the binding effect of the final order [7].

2. **NO.** The reasonableness of a trustee's fees cannot be decided in advance; it must be determined at the time the claim is filed [8, 9]. Reasonableness depends on variable circumstances, such as: (1) the character and powers of the trusteeship; (2) the risk and responsibility; (3) time; and (4) the labor and skill required in the administration of the trust (citing 54 Am. Jur. 410) [9]. Furthermore, individual trustees cannot be equated with professional trust companies unless equality of circumstances is proved [9].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [10].
