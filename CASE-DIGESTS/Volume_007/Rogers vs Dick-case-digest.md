I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE TESTATE ESTATE OF ROBERT MCCULLOCH DICK; FRANCIS THEOBALD ROGERS v. HELEN C. DICK and HON. ANDRES REYES, G.R. No. L-18220, April 30, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On October 20, 1960, petitioner Francis Theobald Rogers filed a petition for the probate of the will of Robert McCulloch Dick (Special Proceedings No. 3433). Rogers alleged that the decedent was a "British subject domiciled in the Philippines and a resident of Tinajeros, Malabon, Rizal" at the time of his death [1]. Respondent Helen C. Dick filed a "Manifestation and Motion" praying that the petition be corrected to state that the decedent was a "British subject of Scottish nationality and/or citizenship" [1]. Despite Rogers' opposition, respondent Judge Andres Reyes granted the motion and denied the subsequent motion for reconsideration [1]. Rogers filed a petition for certiorari, alleging grave abuse of discretion [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court may compel a party to amend his pleading to include allegations proposed by the opposing party.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that pleadings are written allegations of what is affirmed on one side or denied on the other [2]. A party may amend **his own** pleading, but **not** that of his opponent, as the pleading must reflect the claims, allegations, or defenses of the pleader himself [3]. A party cannot be compelled to allege what he is unwilling to allege or believes not to be a fact [2, 4].

The Court rejected the respondent's reliance on Section 4, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court (Amendment to conform to evidence). The Court clarified that this provision confers discretion upon courts to permit a party to amend **its own** pleading to conform to evidence, not to amend the adverse party's pleading [5]. If the respondent deemed it necessary to establish the decedent's "Scottish nationality," she should have alleged it in **her own** pleading rather than forcing the petitioner to do so [4].

The orders of the respondent Judge dated January 4 and February 9, 1961, are annulled, with costs against respondent Helen C. Dick [6].
