I. CAPTION
ANTONIA A. YEE v. THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS, THE DIVISION SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS OF ANTIQUE, HON. SECRETARY OF EDUCATION, and HON. COMMISSIONER OF CIVIL SERVICE, G.R. No. L-16924, April 29, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Antonia A. Yee was a civil service eligible public school teacher in Antique receiving a monthly salary of P140.00 [1]. On August 10, 1957, she married Ng Foo alias Pio Chet Yee, a Chinese citizen, and consequently lost her Philippine citizenship [2]. Effective October 28, 1957, she was removed from the service via Special Order No. 296 issued by the Division Superintendent, pursuant to a ruling by the Director of Public Schools that she was no longer authorized to teach [2]. Yee filed a petition for *mandamus* before the Court of First Instance of Antique [3]. The lower court ruled in her favor, declaring the removal illegal and ordering her reinstatement with back salaries [3]. The respondents appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's removal from the teaching service due to her loss of Philippine citizenship was legal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the removal was legal because the petitioner ceased to be a Filipino citizen [4]. Teaching in a public school is considered part of the "classified service" (as it is not listed under the unclassified service in Section 671 of the Revised Administrative Code) and is a public function reserved for Filipino citizens [5], [4]. Under Section 675 of the Revised Administrative Code, citizenship is a requirement for admission to civil service examinations, and this qualification must be maintained to hold the position [4]. A change in citizenship, whether voluntary or by operation of law, disqualifies a person from continuing in a civil service position [4]. Upon her marriage to a Chinese citizen, the petitioner lost her Philippine citizenship and was strictly disqualified from holding her position in the teaching service [6], [7].

The judgment appealed from is reversed and the petition is denied [8].
