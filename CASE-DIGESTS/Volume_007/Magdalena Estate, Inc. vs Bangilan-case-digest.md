I. CAPTION
MAGDALENA ESTATE, INC. and WILLIAM A. YOTOKO v. FRANCISCO BANGILAN, et al., G.R. No. L-16357, April 22, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Francisco Bangilan, et al. filed a petition (Case No. 1177-V) in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against Magdalena Estate, Inc. asserting two causes of action. First, they claimed recovery of salary differentials, alleging they were paid only P3.00 daily instead of the P4.00 statutory minimum from 1953 until July 9, 1956. Second, respondent Maximino Bautista sought separation pay, alleging unjust dismissal in January 1959 after 12 years of service.

Petitioners moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the CIR lacked jurisdiction over the claims. The CIR denied the motion to dismiss and the subsequent motion for reconsideration. Petitioners filed this petition for certiorari and prohibition to enjoin the CIR from proceeding with the case.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over claims for recovery of minimum wage underpayment and separation pay when there is no existing labor dispute.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court granted the writ of prohibition.

Regarding the claim for underpayment, the Court held that jurisdiction belongs to the Court of First Instance (CFI), not the CIR. Under **Section 16(a) of Republic Act No. 602 (Minimum Wage Law)**, actions to recover underpayment may be brought in any "competent court," which refers to the CFI. The CIR only has jurisdiction under RA 602 if the dispute concerns minimum wages *above* the applicable statutory minimum or involves an actual strike, neither of which applied here. Citing *Teodora Donato v. Philippine Marine Officers Association*, the Court emphasized that where the claim pertains exclusively to past wages and no current labor dispute exists, the CIR lacks jurisdiction [1-4].

Regarding the claim for separation pay under **Republic Act No. 1052**, the Court ruled that this also falls within the jurisdiction of the CFI. Relying on *Hacienda Luisita Estate v. Alberto*, the Court explained that a simple claim for separation pay due to removal, without describing other concurring incidents (such as unfair labor practice) or data connected to the removal, is not within the scope of the CIR's power [5, 6].

The writ was granted, and the respondent Judges of the Court of Industrial Relations were permanently enjoined from taking cognizance of Case No. 1177-V [7].
