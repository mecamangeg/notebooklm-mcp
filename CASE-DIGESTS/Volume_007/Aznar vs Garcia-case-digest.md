I. CAPTION
AZNAR v. GARCIA, G.R. No. L-16749, January 31, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Edward E. Christensen, a citizen of the United States and the State of California, died in Manila leaving a will executed in the Philippines [1, 2]. In his will, he acknowledged Maria Lucy Christensen as his only child and bequeathed to her the residue of his estate, while giving Helen Christensen Garcia, whom he declared was not related to him, a legacy of only P3,600 [3, 4]. Helen, having been judicially declared as Edward’s acknowledged natural child in a separate proceeding, opposed the project of partition, arguing she was deprived of her legitime under Philippine law [5].

The Court of First Instance of Davao ruled that since Edward was a U.S. citizen, the intrinsic validity of his will was governed by California law under Article 16 of the Civil Code, which allows a testator to dispose of his property as he desires without forced heirship [6]. Helen appealed, contending that while the national law governs, the conflict of laws rule of California (Article 946 of the California Civil Code) refers the matter back to the law of the decedent's domicile [5, 7]. Edward had resided in the Philippines from 1913 until his death in 1953, returning to California only for short visits [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the intrinsic validity of the testamentary provisions should be governed by Philippine law.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that Philippine law applies. While Article 16 of the Civil Code provides that the intrinsic validity of testamentary provisions is regulated by the national law of the decedent, the "national law" of a California citizen includes its conflict of laws rules [10, 11]. Article 946 of the Civil Code of California prescribes that "If there is no law to the contrary, in the place where personal property is situated, it is deemed to follow the person of its owner, and is governed by the law of his domicile" [12].

The Court found that Edward was domiciled in the Philippines at the time of his death, as he had resided there for decades and never acquired a home in California [9, 13]. Consequently, the conflict of laws rule of California referred the matter back to the Philippines (the law of the domicile) [14, 15]. Applying the doctrine of *renvoi*, the Court accepted the referral back to avoid the issue being "tossed back and forth" between the states [15]. Under Philippine law (Arts. 887(4) and 894), acknowledged natural children are forced heirs; thus, the deprivation of Helen's legitime was invalid [16].

The decision was reversed, and the case was returned to the lower court for partition in accordance with Philippine law [17].
