I. CAPTION
HON. LOPE DAMASCO v. HON. ABUNDIO Z. ARRIETA, et al., G.R. No. L-18879, January 31, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lope Damasco, the Provincial Governor of Bukidnon, was sued in a special civil action for mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bukidnon by respondents Avisado, Libertad, and Artianza for reinstatement and payment of salaries. Damasco was represented by the Provincial Fiscal, Senator Estanislao Fernandez, and Congressman Felicisimo Ocampo. On December 2, 1960, the CFI rendered a decision against Damasco. The Provincial Fiscal received a copy of the decision on December 12, 1960. He did not appeal but requested the Clerk of Court to send a copy to Damasco's private counsel in Manila. Congressman Ocampo received the decision on December 15, 1960. On January 3, 1961, Atty. Abelardo Subido filed a notice of appeal for Damasco. The CFI granted the respondents' motion for execution, ruling that the decision had become final 15 days after the Fiscal's receipt of the decision. The Court of Appeals affirmed the CFI's ruling. Damasco appealed, arguing that he could be represented by private counsel and the appeal period should be reckoned from the private counsel's receipt of the decision.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the period for appeal should be reckoned from the date of receipt of the decision by the Provincial Fiscal (counsel of record) rather than the subsequent receipt by the private counsel.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. The Court ruled that notice to any one of several counsel on record is equivalent to notice to all counsel. Since there was no proof that the Fiscal had withdrawn as counsel, he remained the counsel of record [1]. The Court applied the doctrine in *Baquiran vs. Court of Appeals*, which held that where the requirements for substitution of attorneys are not met, notice of judgment served on the original counsel of record is notice to the client, and the date of such receipt is the starting point for the appeal period [2].

Additionally, the Court noted that the action was for *mandamus*, which requires an appeal to be filed within 15 days pursuant to Section 17, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court. Even if the period were reckoned from the private counsel's receipt on December 15, 1960, the appeal filed on January 3, 1961 (19 days later) was already beyond the reglementary period [3].

Appeal dismissed; decision affirmed.
