I. CAPTION
FERNANDEZ v. LEDESMA, [G.R. Number and Date not provided in source], Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Celso A. Fernandez was appointed *ad interim* Chief of Police of Basilan City in 1954 and confirmed by the Commission on Appointments [1]. In 1957, he was suspended administratively for one month, and later suspended again due to criminal charges for disobedience and oral defamation, of which he was eventually acquitted [1, 2]. Despite the acquittal, he remained suspended. On April 28, 1959, Executive Secretary Juan C. Pajo informed Fernandez that the President had terminated his services and designated Respondent Cecilio Ledesma in his stead [3, 4]. Ledesma took his oath of office. Fernandez filed a petition for *quo warranto* with *mandamus* before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Basilan City, arguing his removal was without cause and violated the Constitution [3]. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that the removal was in accordance with Section 17 of Republic Act No. 288 (Charter of the City of Basilan) [4]. Fernandez appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the termination of the petitioner’s services as Chief of Police by the President constituted an illegal removal without cause.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. The Court held that Section 17 of Republic Act No. 288 expressly authorizes the President to remove the Chief of Police "at his discretion," unlike the municipal judge who may only be removed "according to law" [5, 6]. This distinction indicates legislative intent to make the Chief of Police's continuance in office dependent upon the pleasure of the President [7].

The Court ruled that the position of Chief of Police of Basilan City does not have a fixed term of office [7]. Where no term is fixed, the tenure is dependent on the discretion of the appointing power [7, 8]. Citing *Alba v. Alajar*, the Court explained that the replacement of an official holding office at the pleasure of the President is not a "removal" but merely an "expiration of tenure" [9]. Consequently, the constitutional protection against removal without cause—which applies to officials with fixed terms—could not be invoked [10, 11]. The termination was a valid exercise of the President's discretion [11].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**, without costs [12].
