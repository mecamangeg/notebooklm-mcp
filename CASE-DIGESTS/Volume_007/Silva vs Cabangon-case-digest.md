I. CAPTION
FILOMENA SILVA v. HON. JUDGE CABANGON and FRANCISCO SICAT, [G.R. Number and Date not provided in source], Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Francisco Sicat, a tenant on Petitioner Filomena Silva’s landholding since 1937, filed a petition in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) in 1958 for the reliquidation of palay crops [1]. Silva counterclaimed for Sicat’s ejectment, alleging that he was incapacitated due to sickness and had employed his son to work the land without her permission [1]. She further alleged that Sicat worked on another landholding in 1950 without her consent [2, 3]. Sicat admitted he suffered from pneumonia in 1951 and stomach ulcers in 1957, which prevented him from plowing during the 1957-1958 second crop, but his children worked the field under his supervision [4, 5]. The CAR ordered reliquidation in favor of Sicat and dismissed Silva's counterclaim for ejectment [6, 7]. Silva appealed the dismissal of her counterclaim to the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the tenant should be ejected due to incapacity to work.
2. W/N the tenant should be ejected for working another landholding in 1950.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the tenant's incapacity was only temporary, not permanent [8]. While Section 9 of Republic Act No. 1199 extinguishes tenancy upon the tenant's incapacity, Section 24(b) allows a tenant to employ a sub-tenant or immediate family member in cases of illness or temporary incapacity [8, 9]. The evidence showed Sicat was efficient, achieving the highest yield in 1956-1957 with his son's help, and the trial court found he was no longer sick [8, 10].

2. **NO.** regarding the alleged violation of working another landholding in 1950, the Court held that Silva could not eject the tenant on this ground [3]. Although the violation occurred years prior, Silva failed to assert her rights at that time; having "slept on her right," she cannot invoke the protection of the law at this late stage [3, 11].

The Court found for the respondents [10].
