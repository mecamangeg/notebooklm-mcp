**I. CAPTION**
**APOLONIO GONZAGA v. CONRADO D. SENO**, G.R. No. L-20522, April 23, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
In the November 10, 1959 elections for Mayor of Mandawe, Cebu, candidates included Apolonio Gonzaga, Conrado D. Seno, and Vicente B. Seno. Conrado Seno was proclaimed the winner. Gonzaga filed an election protest in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu. The CFI ruled in favor of Seno but reduced his winning margin, admitting 92 ballots containing the words "D. Seno" as valid votes for him [1, 2]. Gonzaga appealed, arguing that under Rule 16 of the Revised Election Code, the initial used to identify a candidate with a shared surname must be the correct initial of their Christian name (which would be "C" for Conrado or "V" for Vicente), and "D" was incorrect [3, 4]. The case was elevated to the Supreme Court on this pure question of law [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the ballots written with "D. Seno" are valid votes for Conrado D. Seno despite the existence of another candidate surnamed Seno.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the ballots were valid. Rule 16, Section 149 of the Revised Election Code requires that when candidates share a surname, the voter must add the correct name, surname, or initial that will identify the candidate [3]. The Court interpreted "initial" to mean not just the initial of the Christian name, but *any initial* that identifies the candidate, including a middle initial or the initial of a nickname [6, 7].

The Court found the votes valid for two reasons:
1.  **Intermediate Initial:** Conrado Seno's correct name in his certificate of candidacy is "Conrado D. Seno," making "D" his genuine middle initial, which sufficiently distinguishes him from Vicente B. Seno [8].
2.  **Nickname Initial:** Conrado Seno was well-known by the nickname "Dado Seno." Citing *Moya v. Del Fierro* (69 Phil. 199), the Court ruled that an initial may stand for a candidate's popular nickname (e.g., "P" for "Pino") if it helps discover the voter's intention [9-11].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [12].
