I. CAPTION
SANTIAGO LOPEZ and IRENEO LOPEZ v. JUAN MAGALLANES, G.R. No. L-14853, April 23, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Santiago and Ireneo Lopez previously filed Civil Case No. 507 against Defendant Juan Magallanes to recover possession of an eight-hectare parcel of land in Malita, Davao. They alleged that the deed conveying the land to Defendant was secured by fraud and was void for lack of administrative approval [1]. The Court of First Instance (CFI) initially ruled the deed was an equitable mortgage, but the Court of Appeals reversed this decision in CA-G.R. No. 987-R. The appellate court held the contract was a valid sale with right to repurchase which Plaintiffs failed to exercise, resulting in the dismissal of the complaint [2, 3].

After the appellate decision became final, Plaintiffs instituted the present action on March 8, 1957, involving a larger tract of land that included the eight hectares from the prior case [4]. The CFI dismissed the new case on the ground of *res judicata* and ordered Plaintiffs to segregate the eight-hectare portion and deliver its title to Defendant [5]. Plaintiffs appealed, admitting the identity of parties and the inclusion of the specific land in the subject matter of the new case [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the present action is barred by *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the lower court correctly applied the principle of *res judicata*.

The Court noted that the identity of the parties was expressly admitted, and the land involved in the first case was included in the bigger land subject of the case at bar [4]. Since the Plaintiffs' right to contest the Defendant's interest or title to the eight hectares had already been put in issue and adversely decided in the previous case, the matter is settled [6, 7]. For *res judicata* to serve as a bar, there must be: (a) a final judgment; (b) jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties; (c) a judgment on the merits; and (d) identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action between the two cases [8]. All requisites being present regarding the eight hectares, the Plaintiffs cannot relitigate the issue.

The decision appealed from is affirmed [7].
