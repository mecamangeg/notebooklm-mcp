I. CAPTION
CIRIACO NOBEL v. VICENTE CABIJE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18206, April 23, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On October 6, 1956, Ciriaco Nobel filed a complaint in the Municipal Court of Cebu City against Vicente Cabije, et al. to recover P908.80 representing underpayment, overtime, and separation pay [1]. The Municipal Court rendered a decision in favor of Nobel [1]. The defendants (except Manila Sawmill Co.) appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) [1]. In the CFI, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), and not the regular courts, had jurisdiction over the case [2]. The CFI granted the motion and dismissed the case [2]. Nobel appealed to the Supreme Court, and the records showed that his complaint did not allege that he was still employed by the defendants or that he was seeking reinstatement [2-4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the regular courts have jurisdiction over a claim for underpayment, overtime, and separation pay when the employee does not seek reinstatement.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the action is merely for the recovery of a monetary obligation which falls under the jurisdiction of the regular courts [4, 5]. The Court explained that while the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has jurisdiction over disputes involving the Minimum Wage Law, Eight-Hour Labor Law, and unfair labor practices, such jurisdiction generally requires that the employer-employee relationship exists or that the employee seeks reinstatement [4]. Citing *Campos, et al. v. Manila Railroad Company, et al.*, the Court held that when the employment relationship is over and the employee does not seek reinstatement, all claims become simple money claims cognizable by regular courts [4].

The Order appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **REMANDED** to the court *a quo* for further proceedings [6].
