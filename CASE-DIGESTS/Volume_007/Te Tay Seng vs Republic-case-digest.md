I. CAPTION
TE TAY SENG, petitioner-appellee, vs. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, opponent-appellant., G.R. No. L-15956, March 30, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Te Tay Seng filed a petition for naturalization on August 25, 1958 [1]. The notice of hearing was published in the Official Gazette, with the last issue dated October 13, 1958, and the hearing was originally set for May 5, 1959 [1]. On April 20, 1959, the petitioner requested to take the testimony of a character witness, Francisco R. Lopez, in advance on April 23, 1959, because the witness was travelling abroad [1]. The Government objected, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction to hear testimony before the published hearing date [1]. The Court of First Instance of Manila allowed the early testimony and subsequently granted the petition on July 14, 1959 [1]. The Republic appealed, questioning the jurisdiction and the qualifications of the character witnesses [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court could validly hear the testimony of a character witness prior to the published hearing date.
2. W/N the character witnesses presented by the petitioner were "credible persons" under the Naturalization Law.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the taking of the witness's testimony on April 23, 1959, did not violate the law. Under Section 1 of Republic Act No. 530, a petition cannot be heard until six months after the last publication, and under Section 10 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, it cannot be heard within thirty days preceding an election [3]. In this case, the six-month period from the last publication on October 13, 1958, had already lapsed by April 23, 1959, and no election was scheduled within 30 days of that date [4].

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the character witnesses failed to prove they were "credible persons" as contemplated by law [2]. Citing *Ong vs. Republic*, the Court explained that a "credible" person is not merely someone without a criminal or police record, or who has not perjured [2, 5]. Rather, the witness must demonstrate good standing in the community, be known as honest and upright, and be reputed to be trustworthy and reliable, such that their word is a good warranty of the petitioner's worthiness [2, 5]. The witnesses in this case failed to establish these qualifications [2].

The decree appealed from is reversed and the petition for naturalization is denied [6].
