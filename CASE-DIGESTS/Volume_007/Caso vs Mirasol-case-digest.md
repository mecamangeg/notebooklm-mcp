I. CAPTION
CASIANO CANO v. JULIA MIRASOL, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18834, March 29, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Casiano Cano purchased a 600-square-meter portion of Lot No. 1152 in Cabanatuan, Iloilo, from Jacinto Yniego in 1937 and took possession of the land. Yniego’s heirs (Respondents) later registered the land in 1958 under Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-25564. Cano demanded that the heirs surrender the title to the Register of Deeds so his 1937 sale could be annotated, but they refused.

Cano filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo (acting as a cadastral court) to compel the surrender of the title. Respondents opposed the petition, alleging that the 1937 deed of sale was not genuine and that Cano’s right to register the sale had already prescribed. The lower court granted Cano’s petition. Respondents appealed, and the case was certified to the Supreme Court on a question of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the cadastral court has jurisdiction to order the surrender of the certificate of title and the annotation of the sale despite the controversial issues raised by the respondents.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the court *a quo*, acting as a cadastral or registration court, lacked jurisdiction to act on the petition.

The Court ruled that when controversial issues are raised—such as the genuineness and due execution of the deed of sale, or the prescription of the right to annotate said deed—the matter falls beyond the summary nature of cadastral proceedings. Under Section 111 of Act 496, if such substantial issues are presented, it is the duty of the cadastral court to dismiss the petition. These questions regarding fraud, validity of the sale, and prescription must be litigated in an ordinary civil action before a regular court, not in a cadastral proceeding [1-3].

Consequently, the petition was dismissed so that the issues could be threshed out in an ordinary case [4].
