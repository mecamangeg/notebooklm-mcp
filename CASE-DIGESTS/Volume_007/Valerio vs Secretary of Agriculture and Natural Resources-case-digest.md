I. CAPTION
APOLINARIO VALERIO v. SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES and LUCERO DE GUZMAN, G.R. No. L-18587, April 23, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
In 1950, Apolinario Valerio and Lucero de Guzman filed conflicting applications with the Rural Progress Administration to purchase Lot 10, Block 18 of the Nuestra Señora de Guia Estate. The Director of Lands initially awarded the lot to Valerio. De Guzman appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources (SANR), who reversed the decision on January 14, 1953, awarding the lot to De Guzman. Valerio's counsel, Atty. Dario Aquino, received the decision on March 9, 1953, but failed to inform Valerio. Atty. Aquino only filed a Motion for Reconsideration on October 30, 1953, long after the 30-day reglementary period had lapsed. The SANR denied the motion because the decision had become final and executory. Valerio filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, claiming he should not be bound by his counsel's negligence, especially since the counsel later withdrew without his consent. The CFI ruled in favor of Valerio, setting aside the SANR decision. De Guzman appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Valerio is bound by the negligence of his counsel regarding the late filing of the Motion for Reconsideration, rendering the administrative decision final.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Valerio is bound by the negligence of his counsel who failed to notify him of the decision. The Supreme Court reiterated the doctrine that a client is bound by the action of his counsel, including the latter's mistakes in the conduct of a case. The Court noted that Valerio was also partly to blame for allowing more than seven months to elapse before inquiring into the status of his case. Furthermore, the SANR decision had already become final and executory due to the lapse of the 30-day appeal period provided in the bureau's regulations. The Court held that an administrative regulation adopted pursuant to law has the force and effect of law. Finding that the Secretary did not abuse his discretion and that De Guzman was the bona fide occupant, the Court reversed the decision appealed from.

**Decision reversed.**
