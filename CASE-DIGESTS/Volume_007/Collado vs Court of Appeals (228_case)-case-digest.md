I cannot create a case digest for *Collado v. Court of Appeals* based on the provided source.

The text provided is an **Annotation** titled "**Doctrine of Non-Collateral Attack of a Decree or Title**" authored by **Judge Domingo Lucenario** [1, 2]. While this annotation is likely attached to the *Collado* case in the Supreme Court Reports Annotated (SCRA), the text itself is a legal article discussing the principle that a Torrens title cannot be attacked collaterally [1, 3]. It cites other cases such as *Samonte v. Sambilon* [4] and *Tuballa v. De la Cruz* [5] to illustrate the doctrine, but it **does not contain the facts, procedural history, or ruling** of the *Collado v. Court of Appeals* decision itself.

Would you like me to use the **source discovery** tool to find the actual text of the *Collado v. Court of Appeals* decision so I can write the digest for you?
