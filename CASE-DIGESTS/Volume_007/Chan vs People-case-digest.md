The source provided contains only a brief excerpt—specifically the dispositive portion of a resolution correcting a previous judgment from December 21, 1962 [1]—and lacks the necessary facts, legal issues, and reasoning required to write a case digest.

Would you like me to use the **source discovery** tool to find the full text of the *Chan v. People* decision so I can create the digest for you?
