I. CAPTION
FAUSTA AGCANAS, ET AL. v. BRUNO MERCADO and ANTONIO DASALLA, G.R. No. L-15808, April 23, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On November 25, 1956, plaintiffs Agcanas, et al. filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Isabela to recover portions of a parcel of land. On December 4, defendants Mercado and Dasalla filed a Motion for a Bill of Particulars [1]. Subsequently, on December 17, defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, requesting that the consideration of their Motion for a Bill of Particulars be held in abeyance pending the resolution of the Motion to Dismiss [1].

On March 7, 1957, the CFI denied the Motion to Dismiss and ordered defendants to answer the complaint. Defendants did not file an answer, relying on their pending Motion for a Bill of Particulars. Consequently, on October 17, 1957, the trial court declared them in default and authorized the clerk of court to receive plaintiffs' evidence [1]. The court rendered a decision in favor of plaintiffs on December 13, 1957. Defendants moved to set aside the order of default and the judgment, arguing that their Motion for a Bill of Particulars had not yet been resolved, but the court denied their motions [1, 2]. Defendants appealed to the Supreme Court on a question of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in declaring the defendants in default while their Motion for a Bill of Particulars remained unresolved.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the order of default and the decision of the trial court.

The Court held that it was practical for the defendants to request that their Motion for a Bill of Particulars be held in abeyance while the Motion to Dismiss was pending, as granting the latter would obviate the need for the former [3]. Upon the denial of a defendant's Motion to Dismiss, the reglementary period within which to file an answer remains suspended until the Motion for a Bill of Particulars previously filed is resolved [3, 4].

Specifically, the period to answer is suspended until the motion for a bill of particulars is denied, or, if granted, until the bill is served on the moving party [3, 4]. Since the trial court had not acted upon the pending Motion for a Bill of Particulars, the period for the defendants to file their answer had not yet lapsed, making the declaration of default improper. The case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [5].
