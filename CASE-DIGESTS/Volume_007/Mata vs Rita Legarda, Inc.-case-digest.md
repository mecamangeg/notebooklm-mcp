**I. CAPTION**
**MATA v. RITA LEGARDA, INC.**, G.R. No. L-18941, January 31, 1963.

*(Note: The provided source is an annotation citing this case and does not explicitly state the Ponente.)*

**II. FACTS**
The case involves an action to compel the execution of a deed of absolute sale. The defendant, Rita Legarda, Inc., was represented by counsel. During the proceedings, a notice of hearing was served upon an employee of the defendant corporation instead of being served on the defendant’s attorney of record.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a notice of hearing served upon an employee of a defendant corporation, rather than its attorney of record, binds the client.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that in an action where a party appears by attorney, the notice of hearing served upon an employee of the defendant corporation does not bind the attorney of record nor his client [1].

The Court reiterated the rule that where a party appears by attorney, all notices required by law must be served to the attorney and not the client [2], [3]. Notice upon the party itself is not considered notice in law once they are represented by counsel [3]. The purpose of this rule is to maintain a uniform procedure and ensure the case is prosecuted by the competent hands of the attorney [4], [1].
