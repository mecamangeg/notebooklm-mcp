I. CAPTION
CRISPINA GUANZON, ET AL. v. FERNANDO MAPA, G.R. No. L-19249, February 28, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants filed Civil Case No. 4666 against defendant-appellee Mapa. On October 5, 1959, the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental dismissed the complaint for "lack of interest" after plaintiffs requested multiple postponements [1, 2]. The dispositive portion of the dismissal order read: "WHEREFORE, the plaintiffs' motion for postponement is denied and this case is hereby dismissed for lack of interest. The defendant's counterclaim is likewise dismissed, without prejudice" [2].

Subsequently, plaintiffs filed a second complaint (Civil Case No. 5557) regarding the same subject matter [2]. Defendant moved to dismiss on the ground of *res judicata*, arguing the previous dismissal was with prejudice [2]. The trial court granted the motion, ruling that the first sentence of the previous order was unconditional and thus an adjudication on the merits under the Rules of Court [3]. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing that the phrase "without prejudice" in the second sentence of the order should also apply to the dismissal of the complaint because of the word "likewise" [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the complaint in Civil Case No. 4666 was with prejudice, thereby barring the subsequent action.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. The Court held that the dismissal of the complaint was without any condition, and under Section 3, Rule 30 (now Rule 17) of the Rules of Court, such dismissal is understood to be with prejudice and has the effect of an adjudication on the merits [3, 4].

The Court rejected the appellants' grammatical argument regarding the word "likewise." The dispositive portion consisted of two distinct sentences. The phrase "without prejudice" appeared only in the second sentence referring to the counterclaim [4]. Had the judge intended the condition to apply to the complaint, he would have suffixed it to the first sentence or used a comma to connect the two clauses [4]. Since the dismissal was with prejudice, the subsequent action is barred.

The Order appealed from is affirmed [5].
