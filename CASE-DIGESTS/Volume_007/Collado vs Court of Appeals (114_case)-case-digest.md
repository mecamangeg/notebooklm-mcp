Based on the sources provided, I cannot fulfill your request to write a case digest for **Collado v. Court of Appeals**.

The document provided (**Source 1-24**) is an **Annotation** titled *"Doctrine of Non-Collateral Attack of a Decree or Title"* [1]. While this annotation appears to be appended to the *Collado* case in the Supreme Court Reports Annotated (SCRA), the text itself only discusses general legal principles and cites *other* cases (such as *Samonte v. Sambilon* [2] and *Tuballa v. De la Cruz* [3]) to explain the doctrine. It does not contain the specific facts, issues, or the court's ruling for *Collado v. Court of Appeals*.

Would you like me to search for the full text of the *Collado v. Court of Appeals* decision so I can create the case digest for you?
