I. CAPTION
PEOPLE’S SURETY AND INSURANCE COMPANY, INC. v. HON. CRISANTO ARAGON, THE SHERIFF OF MANILA and EULOGIO P. FLORES, G.R. No. L-19423, January 31, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Alfredo Baura filed a complaint for the recovery of a car (replevin) against respondent Eulogio P. Flores in the Municipal Court of Manila. To secure immediate possession, Baura filed a bond subscribed by petitioner People’s Surety and Insurance Co., Inc. A warrant for seizure was issued but was returned unsatisfied as the plaintiff asked to hold service in abeyance [1], [2].

When the case was called, Baura failed to appear. Flores filed a motion to dismiss with a counterclaim for P2,000.00 in damages for "embarrassment, mental anxiety and torture." A copy of the motion was served on Baura but not on the petitioner surety [3]. The court subsequently dismissed the complaint and ordered Baura to pay Flores P2,000.00 in damages. When the decision became final, Flores moved for the execution of the bond, which respondent Judge Aragon granted [3], [4]. Petitioner moved for reconsideration, arguing that no application for damages was made against the bond, no notice was given to the surety, and no judgment was rendered against the bond. The motion was denied [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the surety is liable for the damages awarded to the defendant despite the lack of a specific application for damages against the bond and lack of notice to the surety.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the execution of the bond was improper. Under Section 10, Rule 62 and Section 20, Rule 59 of the Rules of Court, four requisites must be observed to recover on a replevin bond: (1) an application showing the right to damages and the amount thereof; (2) notice of the application to the plaintiff and his surety; (3) a hearing in case the application is opposed; and (4) the inclusion of the award for damages in the judgment [5], [6].

In this case, the defendant never filed an application for damages arising from the wrongful seizure of property; the writ of replevin was never even carried out [7]. The damages claimed in the counterclaim were for the plaintiff's bad faith, not for the deprivation of possession [7]. Furthermore, the failure to file an application for damages before the entry of final judgment bars recovery on the bond (*Visayan Surety & Insurance Corp. v. Pascual*) [8].

Even assuming the counterclaim served as an application, no notice was given to the surety. Due notice to the surety setting forth the facts and amount claimed is indispensable to satisfy due process (*Aguasin v. Velasquez*) [8], [9]. Without such notice and an opportunity to be heard, the surety cannot be condemned to pay [9].

The orders directing the execution of the petitioner’s bond are set aside, with costs against respondent Flores [10].
