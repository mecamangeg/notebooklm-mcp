I. CAPTION
RUPERTO ADVINCULA and BRAULIO AVELINO v. HON. COMMISSION ON APPOINTMENTS, et al., G.R. No. L-19823, January 12, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Advincula and Avelino filed a petition for *mandamus* regarding their appointments, which was previously dismissed by the Supreme Court. Their appointments were confirmed by the Commission on Appointments on April 27, a Friday. A motion for reconsideration of said confirmation was filed on April 30, the following Monday [1]. Petitioners argued that under Section 21 of the Revised Rules of the Commission on Appointments, which requires such motions to be presented "not more than one (1) day after their approval," the confirmation had already become final and the Monday filing was late [1]. The Commission contended that Saturday is not a working day and should be excluded from the computation [2]. Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Supreme Court's decision dismissing their petition [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Saturday is included in the computation of the one-day period to file a motion for reconsideration under the Rules of the Commission on Appointments.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that Saturday is not a working day and is properly excluded from the computation [4].

The Court held that Section 9, Article VI of the Constitution, which defines Congress's session days excluding Sundays, does not apply to the Commission on Appointments because the sessions of the two bodies are not coetaneous [2, 5]. The Commission is governed by Section 13, Article VI, which allows it to meet "at the call of its Chairman or a majority of its Members" while Congress is in session, giving it discretion over its meeting days [6]. Furthermore, the Commission's interpretation aligns with Republic Act No. 1880, which mandates a five-day work week (Monday to Friday) for government offices not excepted by law [2, 7]. Consequently, the motion filed on Monday was timely.

The Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED** [7].
