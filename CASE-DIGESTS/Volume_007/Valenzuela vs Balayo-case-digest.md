I. CAPTION
LUCENA VALENZUELA v. FELICISIMO BALAYO, G.R. No. L-18748, March 30, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Lucena Valenzuela filed an action for forcible entry against Felicisimo Balayo in the Justice of the Peace Court of Sipocot, Camarines Sur. The lower court ruled in favor of Valenzuela. Balayo appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Sur. On April 13, 1957, the Deputy Clerk of the CFI sent a notice of the docketed appeal to the parties via registered mail [1]. Balayo received this notice personally on April 27, 1957 [1].

Four months later, Balayo had not filed an answer. Consequently, upon Valenzuela's motion, the CFI declared Balayo in default and rendered judgment against him on October 28, 1957 [2]. Balayo moved to set aside the default order and judgment, arguing that the notice of the appeal should have been served on his attorney who filed the appeal, not on him personally [2]. The CFI denied the motion [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the notice of the pendency of the appeal sent to the party personally, rather than to his counsel, is valid.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that under Section 7, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court (as it stood at the time), it is expressly provided that notice of the pendency of the appeal be given to the **parties** [4, 5]. This express provision cannot be interpreted to mean that notice is valid only if given to the lawyers [4].

The Court reasoned that in an appeal from an inferior court to the CFI, only the complaint is deemed reproduced, and the proceeding essentially restarts with the summoning of the defendant. However, since the defendant is already within the court's jurisdiction due to the appeal, the notice takes the place of the summons [5]. Therefore, service upon Balayo personally was valid.

The order appealed from is affirmed [6].
