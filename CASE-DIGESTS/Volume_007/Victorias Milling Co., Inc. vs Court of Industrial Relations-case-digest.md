I. CAPTION
VICTORIAS MILLING COMPANY, INC. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and FREE VISAYAN WORKERS (NEGROS BRANCH), G.R. No. L-17281, March 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Victorias Milling Co. operates a sugar central and owns sugar cane haciendas [1]. Respondent Free Visayan Workers (Union) submitted collective bargaining proposals on behalf of laborers working in Petitioner's haciendas [1]. Petitioner refused to negotiate, contending that the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. No. 875) does not apply to agricultural workers [1]. Consequently, the Union filed a charge of Unfair Labor Practice, and the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) Prosecutor filed a complaint against Petitioner [1]. Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss alleging lack of jurisdiction, which the CIR denied [1]. Petitioner then filed this action for prohibition [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over unfair labor practice cases involving agricultural laborers.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the CIR lacks jurisdiction. It is the nature of the work that classifies a worker as an "agricultural laborer" [2]. Since the Union members were employed in haciendas principally for planting and harvesting sugar cane, they are agricultural laborers [2].

Agricultural laborers are exempted from the definition of "employee" under Section 2(d) of the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. No. 875) [3, 4]. Instead, the Court held that unfair labor practice cases involving agricultural laborers fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the **Court of Agrarian Relations**, which was created by R.A. No. 1267 to settle controversies in agricultural land relationships [2, 4, 5].

The petition is **GRANTED**, the CIR order denying the motion to dismiss is set aside, and the CIR is ordered to desist from taking further action in the case [5].
