I. CAPTION
CRISPULO D. BELMI and MARIO ALAB v. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19343, April 27, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Belmi and Alab were share tenants of respondent Enrique Zobel in Hacienda Bigaa, Batangas, under contracts executed in 1955. Paragraph 7 of their contracts required them to plant a second crop (*palagad*) or corn after the regular harvest, "according to the instructions of the landholder." In 1958, Zobel introduced contour-plowing recommended by the Bureau of Soil Conservation, which destroyed the old dikes. Zobel constructed new dikes at his own expense.

The petitioners filed a case for reinstatement and damages against Zobel and others in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR), claiming damages for the destroyed dikes. Respondents counterclaimed for ejectment due to breach of contract. The CAR dismissed the petitioners' claim for damages and ordered the ejectment of Belmi for failing to plant *palagad* in 1959 and 1960 without valid cause. Belmi appealed, arguing for the first time that he did not plant the second crop because he received no instructions from the landlord.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Belmi should be ejected for failure to plant the second crop (*palagad*).
2. W/N the tenants are entitled to damages for the destruction of the old dikes due to contour-plowing.
3. W/N the hiring of workers for transplanting and reaping constitutes prohibited sub-tenancy.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed Belmi's ejectment. The trial court found that Belmi failed to plant the second crop in 1959 and 1960 without explanation, preferring to make *kaingin* elsewhere, which constituted a breach of contract. Belmi's defense that he lacked instructions from the landlord is a factual issue that was not raised in the lower court and, therefore, cannot be considered for the first time on appeal [1], [2]. Furthermore, evidence showed he planted *palagad* in 1957, proving he knew of the obligation [2].

2. **NO.** The contour-plowing redounded to the mutual benefit of the tenants and the landlord. The landlord constructed new dikes along the contour lines at his own expense, which the tenants used in subsequent years [3]. The tenants failed to prove actual damage or prejudice, as harvest records showed no diminution compared to yields prior to the contour-plowing [4].

3. **NO.** The Court ruled that transplanting seedlings and reaping harvests do not form part of a tenant's labor under the law. Consequently, workers engaged by the tenant to perform these specific chores are not considered "sub-tenants" within the contemplation of Section 24 of Republic Act No. 1199 [5], [6].

The petition is **DENIED**, and the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations is **AFFIRMED**.
