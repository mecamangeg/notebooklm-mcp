I. CAPTION
TOLENTINO v. ONGSIAKO, [G.R. Number and Date not provided in source], Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellant Esperidion Tolentino, claiming to be the successor-in-interest of Severo Domingo, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija on May 20, 1959. He sought to enforce the dissenting opinion in the 1930 case *Severo Domingo, et al. v. Santos Ongsiako, et al.* (G.R. No. 32776). Tolentino alleged that Domingo died without receiving a copy of the 1930 decision and that he (Tolentino) only recently learned of it. He argued that the majority decision was erroneous and unjust, while the dissenting opinion represented the correct view. He further contended that the failure of service constituted a denial of due process. The lower court dismissed the complaint for lack of cause of action. Tolentino appealed, asking that the case be heard as a proceeding *coram nobis* on equitable grounds.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a dissenting opinion can be enforced.
2. W/N the final judgment from 1930 can be reopened or reviewed via a writ of error *coram nobis*.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the prayer to enforce a dissenting opinion is untenable. A dissenting opinion "affirms or overrules no claim, right, or obligation, and neither disposes of, nor awards, anything; it merely expresses the views of the dissenter." Consequently, there is nothing in a dissenting opinion to enforce [1].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the issue is *res judicata* and has stood unchallenged for 30 years. Regarding the due process claim, the records showed the predecessor was represented by counsel, Atty. Ramon Diokno. Under the Rules of Court, service to counsel is valid service to the client, and the Clerk of Court is presumed to have regularly performed this duty [2].

Furthermore, the Court held that the writ of error *coram nobis* is not recognized in the Philippines. Public policy and sound practice demand that judgments become final and irrevocable at a definite date fixed by law (*Interes rei publicae ut finis sit litium*) [3]. Even under common law rules, such a writ would not lie after a judgment has been affirmed on appeal, nor can it be grounded on facts already adjudicated. Additionally, jurisdiction for such a writ would lie exclusively with the court that rendered the judgment (the Supreme Court), not the trial court [4].

The order of dismissal is affirmed.
