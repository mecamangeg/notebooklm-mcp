I. CAPTION
NORTH CAMARINES LUMBER COMPANY, INC. v. METROPOLITAN INSURANCE COMPANY, G.R. No. L-15754, January 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
North Camarines Lumber Company filed an action against Metropolitan Insurance Company to recover insurance proceeds. The plaintiff claimed P135,000.00 plus attorney’s fees for the loss of a vessel and cargo, and P35,520.37 plus other fees for repairs [1]. The defendant set up a counterclaim of P24,578.00 for attorney’s fees [1]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the first cause of action (ordering a return of premiums) and awarded P31,301.01 for the second cause of action [1]. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court raising questions of fact and law [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the amounts claimed by both parties should be joined to determine if the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the amounts claimed by both parties should not be considered jointly in the determination of the corresponding appellate jurisdiction [3, 4]. It appeared that the amounts claimed by the plaintiff and defendant separately did not reach P200,000.00, which was the jurisdictional threshold at the time [4]. Consequently, the Supreme Court ruled that the case fell under the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals and ordered the case certified to said court [4].
