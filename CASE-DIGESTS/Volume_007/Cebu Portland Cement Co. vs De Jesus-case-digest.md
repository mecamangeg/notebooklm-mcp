I. CAPTION
CEBU PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY v. MAMERTO DE JESUS, G.R. No. L-18146, March 30, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On December 12, 1957, the Board of Directors of petitioner Cebu Portland Cement Company passed Resolution No. 143-57 granting a "separation bonus" to employees who voluntarily separated from service [1]. Respondent De Jesus, an employee, applied for voluntary separation and was paid P21,600.00 as a separation bonus [2, 3]. This amount was in addition to the retirement benefits he received from the GSIS under Commonwealth Act (C.A.) No. 186 [3].

The Auditor General and the Office of the President subsequently ruled that the separation bonus was illegal *per se* because C.A. No. 186 prohibits the payment of additional gratuities to employees already entitled to retirement benefits under the Act [4, 5]. Petitioner filed an action to recover the P21,600.00 paid to De Jesus [6]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the action, ruling that under the Civil Code, the petitioner could not recover what it had voluntarily given [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent is entitled to the "separation bonus" in addition to the retirement benefits received under C.A. No. 186.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The payment was invalid. Section 28(b) of C.A. No. 186 expressly provides that "no gratuity or benefit shall be paid by an employer to an employee entitled to the retirement benefit of this Act" [5]. The Court held that the policy of the law is to grant only one retirement benefit [7, 8].

The Court rejected the argument that the payment was a "bonus" for loyalty or industry. The resolution expressly stated it was an inducement for personnel to retire due to reduced income, making it a second retirement gratuity rather than a true bonus derived from profits [9, 10]. Although the petitioner's officials voluntarily granted the bonus, mistakes of public officers cannot prejudice the State to the extent of violating an express provision of law [7, 11]. Under Article 1306 of the Civil Code, contracting parties cannot make provisions contrary to law or public policy [7, 8].

The judgment of the lower court is set aside, and the respondent is ordered to return the P21,600.00 to the petitioner [12].
