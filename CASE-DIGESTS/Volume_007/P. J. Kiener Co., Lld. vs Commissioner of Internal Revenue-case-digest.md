I. CAPTION
P. J. KIENER CO., LTD. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-16417, January 31, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In 1948, Fortunato Concepcion, Inc. was awarded the contract for the construction of the Gapan-Sta. Rosa Road for the price of P1,691,969.93 [1]. It subcontracted the actual construction work to petitioner P. J. Kiener Co., Ltd., paying the latter P1,288,009.06 [1, 2]. Fortunato Concepcion, Inc. paid the 2% contractor's percentage tax on the full contract price [3]. Subsequently, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed the petitioner for deficiency contractor's tax, surcharge, and penalty on the P1,288,009.06 it received as a sub-contractor [4, 5]. Petitioner contested the assessment before the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), arguing that it was not subject to the percentage tax under Section 191 of the National Internal Revenue Code because the principal contractor had already paid the tax on the entire project [3, 5]. The CTA rendered a decision upholding the assessment [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a sub-contractor is liable for the contractor's percentage tax on its gross receipts even if the principal contractor has already paid the tax on the full contract price.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's decision. Under Section 191 of the Internal Revenue Code, construction work contractors are liable for a tax equivalent to a percentage of their "gross receipts" [3]. Although Fortunato Concepcion, Inc. was the principal, the construction job was actually performed by the petitioner as a sub-contractor, and the P1,288,009.06 it received constituted its own gross receipts subject to the tax [2]. The Court held that the principal contractor's payment of the tax does not exempt the sub-contractor from its own distinct liability under the law [6, 7]. Consequently, the petition was denied and the decision affirmed [8].
