I. CAPTION
JESUS LANCITA, ET AL. v. GONZALO MAGBANUA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15467, January 31, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On March 21, 1951, respondents Magbanua filed a complaint for Forcible Entry against petitioners Lancita in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Buluan, Cotabato [1]. On July 17, 1951, the JP Court declared petitioners in default and rendered judgment ordering them to vacate the land and pay damages [2, 3]. On August 21, 1951, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration. On October 24, 1951, the JP Court granted the motion and stayed the decision, but subsequently revived the July 17 decision on November 27, 1951 [3, 4].

On November 26, 1956, respondents filed a Motion for an Alias Writ of Execution, citing the Sheriff's failure to eject the petitioners [4]. The JP Court issued the writ on March 27, 1957 [4]. Petitioners filed a Petition for Certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cotabato, arguing that the five-year period to execute the judgment by motion had prescribed, asserting the judgment became final on July 17, 1951 [5]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling the execution was timely [6, 7]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the alias writ of execution was issued within the five-year prescriptive period for execution by motion.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the motion for execution was filed within the prescriptive period [8].

First, if the computation begins from November 27, 1951—the date the judgment became final after the stay was lifted and the decision revived—to the filing of the motion on November 26, 1956, only 4 years, 11 months, and 29 days had elapsed [8]. Second, even if computed from the original decision on July 17, 1951, the period is extended by delays occasioned by the debtor. The Court applied the general rule that the time during which execution is stayed by agreement, injunction, appeal, or "otherwise" is excluded from the five-year limitation [9]. Any interruption or delay caused by the debtor extends the time within which the writ may be issued without *scire facias* [9, 10].

The Court observed that the respondents had not slept on their rights, but rather the execution was delayed due to causes beyond their control, including the petitioners' failure to comply with previous writs [7]. The appeal was dismissed and the orders affirmed [7].
