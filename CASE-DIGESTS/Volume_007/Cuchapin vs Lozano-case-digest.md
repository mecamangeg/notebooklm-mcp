I. CAPTION
IRENEO CUCHAPIN v. VIRGINIA LOZANO, et al., G.R. No. L-13542, March 30, 1963.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-Appellant Ireneo Cuchapin filed an action to annul the sale of a homestead lot (Lot 2180) originally registered to his grandfather, Casimiro Gattoc [1, 2]. Cuchapin claimed ownership of the eastern half based on an unregistered deed of acknowledgment executed by Gattoc in 1932, which stated that Cuchapin had possessed and cleared the land with him [1]. Gattoc also executed an unregistered mortgage in favor of Cuchapin [1, 3]. After Gattoc died, his daughter and sole heir adjudicated the land to herself and sold it to Eusebio Carbonell in 1940, who subsequently sold it to Casiano Lozano (father of defendants-appellees) in 1944 [3, 4]. The lower court dismissed Cuchapin's complaint, ruling that he failed to prove bad faith on the part of the purchasers and that the 1932 deed was void as it violated the five-year prohibition on alienating homesteads [5]. Cuchapin appealed to the Supreme Court, assigning errors that required reviewing evidence regarding his alleged possession since 1918 and the buyers' good faith [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that it lacked jurisdiction because the assignments of error raised essentially questions of fact that required a review of the evidence [6, 7]. Specifically, the issues of whether the deed of acknowledgment was valid (based on claims of long-term possession) and whether the defendants acquired the property in good faith were factual in nature [7]. Since the questions raised called for a review of the evidence and the amount involved did not exceed the jurisdictional limit (cited as P200,000), the appeal fell within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals [6, 7].

**Disposition:** The case was remanded to the Court of Appeals [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
