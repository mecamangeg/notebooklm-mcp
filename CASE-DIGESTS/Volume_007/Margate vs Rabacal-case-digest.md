I. CAPTION
JOSE MARGATE v. JULIA RABACAL and her minor children JESUS, CORAZON, JULIO, FE, HELEN, RAMON and ELI, all surnamed BERINA, G.R. No. L-14302, April 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Julia Rabacal, the court-appointed guardian of her minor children, filed a petition to sell a residential lot in Camarines Sur to defray litigation expenses and support her wards. The guardianship court granted this authority on May 23, 1948. Consequently, Rabacal executed a Deed of Sale on May 27, 1948, selling the property to Jose Margate for P4,000.00, which Margate paid in full [1], [2].

However, Rabacal subsequently deceived the guardianship court by reporting that she could not find a buyer. Based on this misrepresentation, the court revoked the authority to sell, without notice to Margate. When Margate later applied for registration of the land, Rabacal and her children opposed, arguing the sale was invalid due to the revocation of authority and the lack of judicial approval of the specific sale. The registration court confirmed Margate's title [3], [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the sale is valid despite the subsequent revocation of the guardian's authority to sell.
2. W/N the sale is void for lack of judicial approval of the deed of sale.
3. W/N the validity of the sale can be attacked in the land registration proceedings.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The cancellation of the authority to sell did not affect the buyer's rights because the guardian had already sold the land pursuant to the authority granted. The authority of the court had been "exhausted" as the act was a *fait accompli*, leaving nothing to cancel. Furthermore, the revocation was obtained through the guardian's deception and without notice to the purchaser [3], [6].

2. **NO.** The order authorizing the sale did not impose a condition that the deed of sale must be subsequently approved by the court. Under the circumstances, court approval would be merely *pro-forma*. Moreover, the appellants are estopped from questioning the sale as they requested the authority and derived benefits from the proceeds [7], [6], [8].

3. **NO.** The sale cannot be attacked collaterally in registration proceedings; a separate action to rescind the sale must be filed on grounds specified by law. Additionally, Rabacal was entitled to one-half of the property as her conjugal share, which she could validly dispose of even without judicial approval [9], [10], [11].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Concepcion and Barrera, JJ., concurred in the result [11].
