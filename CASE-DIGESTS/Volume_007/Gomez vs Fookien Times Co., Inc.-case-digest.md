I. CAPTION
MAXIMO GOMEZ v. FOOKIEN TIMES COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-17916, April 30, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On November 19, 1957, Maximo Gomez filed a complaint with Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor against Fookien Times Company, Inc. for separation pay, overtime pay, and additional compensation [1]. The Hearing Officer dismissed the complaint for lack of merit, but upon appeal, the Labor Standards Commission (LSC) modified the decision and awarded Gomez P781.97 [2]. The Company appealed this decision to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila in accordance with Reorganization Plan No. 20-A [3]. The CFI heard the case and rendered judgment dismissing Gomez's complaint, finding that he was separated from service for cause [4]. Gomez appealed the CFI's decision to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Regional Office and Labor Standards Commission had jurisdiction over money claims under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, particularly Section 25, is null and void insofar as it grants regional offices original and exclusive jurisdiction over money claims of laborers [4]. This grant of jurisdiction was made without authority under Republic Act No. 997 [4]. The Court explained that Congress did not intend to transfer jurisdiction from courts of justice to officials appointed under the Reorganization Plan, as judicial power is vested only in the Supreme Court and such courts as the law may establish [5]. Consequently, the decisions of the Hearing Officer and the Labor Standards Commission are null and void, and the decision of the CFI, acting on an appeal from the Commission, is also without valid effect [6].

The decision appealed from is reversed, and the complaint filed by Gomez is dismissed [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Barrera, J., concurred in the result [7].
