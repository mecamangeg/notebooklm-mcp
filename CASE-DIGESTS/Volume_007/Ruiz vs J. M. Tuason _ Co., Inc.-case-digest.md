I. CAPTION
MANUEL B. RUIZ v. J.M. TUASON & CO., INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-18692, January 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellant Manuel B. Ruiz filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Manila against J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. He prayed for the issuance of a final deed of sale for a 420-square-meter parcel of land located in Tatalon, Quezon City, and for the issuance of a transfer certificate of title in his favor [1, 2]. Ruiz claimed rights to the property through a series of sales originating from Florencio Deudor, relying on a Compromise Agreement involving the defendant [3-5]. Additionally, Ruiz sought to enjoin the execution of a writ issued by the Quezon City court in a separate civil case against his predecessor-in-interest, Sixto M. Cacho, which threatened Ruiz with ejectment [2, 6]. The lower court dismissed the complaint on a motion to dismiss, ruling that venue was improperly laid [7, 8]. Ruiz appealed, arguing that his action was for specific performance and therefore transitory, allowing him to file it in Manila [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for specific performance involving the conveyance of land and an injunction against ejectment is a personal action that may be filed in Manila.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that although the complaint is entitled as one for specific performance, the fact that Ruiz asked for a deed of sale and a transfer certificate of title shows that the primary objective is to recover the parcel of land itself [1]. To execute the conveyance, the court would need to make a finding that the plaintiff is the owner of the land, which resolves into an issue of ownership [1].

Under Section 3, Rule 5 of the Rules of Court, actions affecting title to or recovery of possession of real property shall be commenced and tried in the province where the property or any part thereof lies [1]. Since the land is located in Quezon City, the venue was improperly laid in Manila [10]. Furthermore, the prayer for injunction does not make the case transitory, as it is merely ancillary to the principal action which necessarily involves a determination of an interest in land [7, 10].

The order appealed from is affirmed [11].
