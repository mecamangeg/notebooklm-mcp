I. CAPTION
THE CAPITAL INSURANCE AND SURETY COMPANY, INC. v. MARIO DELGADO and LEONOR DELGADO DEE, G.R. No. L-18567, March 30, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Appellee Capital Insurance issued a fire insurance policy and a renewal certificate to appellants Mario Delgado and Leonor Delgado Dee. Despite demands and a promise by Mario Delgado to pay the unpaid premiums totaling P685.20, appellants failed to do so [1, 2]. Consequently, appellee filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu to recover P583.95 in premium charges, P116.79 in attorney's fees, and costs [2]. The CFI rendered a decision ordering appellants to pay the amounts claimed. Appellants appealed, arguing primarily that no insurance contract was consummated due to non-payment of premiums [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the appellee's action was merely to recover the principal sum of P583.95 plus P116.79 as attorney's fees [4]. Such an amount falls within the original exclusive jurisdiction of the justice of the peace court [5]. Therefore, the Court of First Instance of Cebu had no original jurisdiction over the subject matter, and all proceedings held therein were void [4].

The appealed decision is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **DISMISSED** [6].
