I. CAPTION
OFELIA DE GREARTE and RAFAEL GREARTE v. THE LONDON ASSURANCE; TABACALERA INSURANCE CO.; and NORTHERN ASSURANCE CO., LTD., G.R. Nos. L-18742, L-18743, & L-18744, January 31, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, the spouses Grearte, filed complaints against respondent insurance companies to recover proceeds from fire insurance policies [1]. Respondents alleged defenses including fraud and that the goods were destroyed by a typhoon, not fire [1]. During the trial, respondents moved to postpone a hearing due to a prior judicial engagement, but the motion reached the court after the scheduled date [2]. Consequently, the trial court allowed petitioners to present evidence *ex parte* and rendered judgment in their favor [3].

Respondents appealed. The trial court ordered them to amend their Record on Appeal by deleting a specific paragraph and including a court order within 10 days [4]. Instead of retyping the entire record, respondents submitted a "Compliance" with new pages to be inserted into the original record [4]. Petitioners moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing failure to strictly comply with Section 7, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court [5]. The trial court, finding good faith, granted respondents additional time to submit the fully amended record, which was subsequently approved [5, 6]. The Court of Appeals set aside the trial court's decision and remanded the case for reception of evidence, prompting petitioners to appeal to the Supreme Court [3, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondents' appeal was seasonably perfected despite the initial failure to submit a completely redrafted Record on Appeal.
2. W/N the Court of Appeals erred in setting aside the trial court's decision to allow respondents to present evidence.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the appeal was validly perfected because the Rules of Court must be liberally construed to promote their object [6, 8]. The respondents substantially complied with the trial court's order within the designated period, and the flaws in their submission were purely matters of form resulting from an honest misinterpretation of the Rules [6]. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting respondents reasonable time to comply strictly with the rules [6].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the respondents should be given an opportunity to present their evidence because their answers alleged defenses that were *prima facie* meritorious, such as fraud and non-existence of goods [1, 9]. The surrounding circumstances indicated that their failure to appear at the hearing was excusable in the interest of justice and fair play [9].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED [9].
