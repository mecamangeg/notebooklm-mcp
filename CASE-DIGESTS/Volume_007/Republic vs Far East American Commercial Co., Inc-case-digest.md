I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FAR EAST AMERICAN COMMERCIAL CO., INC., and MANILA UNDERWRITERS INSURANCE CO., INC., G.R. No. L-17475, February 28, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On December 1, 1950, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed Far East American Commercial Co., Inc. (Far East) for deficiency sales taxes. On April 23, 1951, Far East offered a compromise to pay P100,000, which the Commissioner accepted. Far East paid P75,000, and the P25,000 balance was guaranteed by a bond issued by Manila Underwriters Insurance Co., Inc. (MUIC). Far East subsequently paid P15,000, leaving an unpaid balance of P10,000.

On July 24, 1958, the Republic filed a complaint to forfeit the bond and collect the P10,000. MUIC filed a cross-claim against Far East and its indemnitors (A. Syyap & Co., et al.) for reimbursement under their indemnity agreement. During the proceedings, MUIC paid the P10,000 to the Republic, leading to the dismissal of the Republic’s complaint. The trial court proceeded with the cross-claim. Far East argued that the action was barred by the 5-year statute of limitations for tax collection under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC). The trial court ruled in favor of MUIC, ordering Far East and its indemnitors to pay the amount. Far East appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action to recover the balance secured by the bond is barred by the prescriptive period for tax collection under the National Internal Revenue Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision. The Court held that an action to recover deficiency taxes, surcharges, and penalties, which was the subject of a compromise agreement guaranteed by a bond, is an action predicated upon **contract** and not a simple tax collection. Consequently, the prescriptive period that bars the action is not the period prescribed by the National Internal Revenue Code for tax collection, but the period provided by the **Civil Code** for actions based on written contracts (ten years). The Court cited *Republic of the Philippines v. J. Amado Araneta* to support the principle that the enforcement of the compromise and bond transforms the liability into a contractual one.

**Disposition:** The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellants.
