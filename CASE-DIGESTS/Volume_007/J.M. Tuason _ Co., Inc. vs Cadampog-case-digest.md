**I. CAPTION**
**J. M. TUASON & CO., INC. v. FEDERICO CADAMPOG**, G.R. No. L-18815, April 27, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiff J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. is the registered owner of a parcel of land in Quezon City covered by TCT No. 1267. On January 2, 1952, defendant Federico Cadampog entered the property without the plaintiff’s consent and occupied 100 square meters. The plaintiff filed an action for ejectment and damages.

Cadampog claimed ownership based on a donation dated May 15, 1950, from Agustin de Torres, who allegedly purchased the land from an heir of the original owner, Telesforo Deudor. Cadampog argued that the plaintiff’s title was void and obtained through fraud. He further contended that the plaintiff was a transferee in bad faith from Rufina Guerrero (widow of Agustin de Torres) through a compromise agreement in other civil cases to which he did not consent.

During the proceedings, Cadampog filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that a separate action for reconveyance (Civil Case No. 4057) filed by Rufina Guerrero against the plaintiff was a prejudicial question. However, without waiting for the resolution of this motion, the parties stipulated facts and presented evidence. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff. Cadampog appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved only questions of law [1-4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the action for reconveyance filed by the donor’s widow is a prejudicial question that warrants the dismissal or suspension of the ejectment case.
2. W/N the defendant can enforce the compromise agreement between the Deudors and the plaintiff to claim rights as a builder in good faith or owner.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The result of the reconveyance case filed by Rufina Guerrero is not determinative of the present case because Cadampog is not a party to that litigation. Furthermore, his donor (Agustin de Torres) had already donated the lot to him prior to the institution of the reconveyance case. Procedurally, Cadampog waived his motion to dismiss based on pendency of another action when he presented evidence and submitted the case for decision on the merits without awaiting the resolution of said motion [5].

2. **NO.** Cadampog is not entitled to enforce a compromise agreement to which he was not a party. The Court reiterated previous rulings (*Tuason & Co. v. Macalindong*; *Tuason & Co. v. Aguirre*) that the compromise stipulation where the Deudors recognized Tuason & Co.’s title cannot be construed as a sale in favor of the latter. As a mere donee who paid nothing for the land, Cadampog's recourse, if any, is against his immediate transferor or their privies, not the registered owner [6].

**Judgment affirmed.**
