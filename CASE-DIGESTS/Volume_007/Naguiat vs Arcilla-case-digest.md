I. CAPTION
SERGIO F. NAGUIAT v. JACINTO ARCILLA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16602, February 28, 1963.

II. FACTS
Respondents were former employees of petitioner Sergio F. Naguiat in his construction business. On January 8, 1959, they filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) seeking recovery of basic and extra compensation for work performed on Sundays and holidays during the years 1956-1957 [1]. Petitioner moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the CIR lacked jurisdiction because the employer-employee relationship had already been terminated. The CIR upheld its jurisdiction, and the CIR *en banc* affirmed this ruling [1]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over money claims for overtime and holiday pay filed by former employees who do not seek reinstatement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) lacks jurisdiction over the case. Relying on the doctrine established in *Price Stabilization Corp. v. Court of Industrial Relations* (*Prisco* case), the Court held that for CIR jurisdiction to apply, there must be an existing employer-employee relationship or the claimant must be seeking reinstatement [2]. When the relationship has been terminated and no reinstatement is sought, claims arising from the Eight-Hour Labor Law or Minimum Wage Law become "mere money claims" that fall within the jurisdiction of regular courts [2, 3].

The Court reiterated the requisites for CIR jurisdiction set forth in *Campos v. Manila Railroad Co.*: (a) existence of employer-employee relationship or a plea for reinstatement; and (b) the controversy involves national interest, unfair labor practice, or the Eight-Hour/Minimum Wage Laws [3, 4]. Since the respondents were former employees at the time of filing and did not petition for reinstatement, their claims did not come under the CIR's jurisdiction [5].

Consequently, the petition is granted, and the orders of the CIR are reversed.
