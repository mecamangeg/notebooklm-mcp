I. CAPTION
NICASIO BERNALDES, SR., PERPETUA BESAS DE BERNALDES and JOVITO BERNALDES v. BOHOL LAND TRANSPORTATION, INC., G.R. No. L-18193, February 27, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On November 27, 1958, Jovito Bernaldes and his brother Nicasio boarded a bus owned by respondent Bohol Land Transportation, Inc. The bus fell off a precipice, resulting in Nicasio's death and serious injuries to Jovito [1]. A criminal case for double homicide thru reckless imprudence was filed against the driver, Leonardo Balabag. Petitioners intervened in the criminal prosecution through private prosecutors but did not reserve the right to file a separate civil action [2]. The driver was acquitted on the ground of reasonable doubt [2]. Subsequently, petitioners filed a complaint for damages against the respondent carrier based on breach of contract of carriage [1]. The lower court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the cause of action was barred by the prior judgment in the criminal case and the petitioners' failure to reserve their right to a separate civil action [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the civil action for damages against the carrier based on breach of contract is barred by the driver's acquittal and the petitioners' failure to reserve the civil action in the criminal case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that a civil action based on the contractual liability of a common carrier (*culpa contractual*) is distinct from the criminal action instituted against the driver based on criminal negligence [4]. Article 31 of the New Civil Code expressly provides that when a civil action is based on an obligation not arising from the act or omission complained of as a felony, it may proceed independently of the criminal proceedings [4]. The failure to reserve the right to recover civil indemnity constitutes a waiver only regarding the defendant in the criminal action, not regarding persons secondarily liable or independent contractual obligations [5].

Furthermore, since the driver was acquitted on reasonable doubt, a civil action for damages for the same act or omission may still be instituted against him under Article 29 of the New Civil Code. If such is the rule against the driver, *a fortiori* it must be allowed against his employer [6].

The order of dismissal is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [6].
