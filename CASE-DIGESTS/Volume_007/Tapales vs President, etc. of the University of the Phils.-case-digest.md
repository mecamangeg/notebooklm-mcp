I. CAPTION
RAMON TAPALES v. THE PRESIDENT and BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17523, March 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Ramon Tapales was appointed by the Board of Regents (BOR) as the permanent and regular Director of the U.P. Conservatory of Music in 1947. On October 2, 1959, the BOR approved a resolution limiting the term of office of all deans and directors to five years. The resolution further provided that incumbent deans and directors who had served five years or more would serve only until May 31, 1960, unless reappointed. Tapales, who was not recommended for reappointment, filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to declare the resolution unconstitutional and to enjoin its enforcement. The respondents argued that deans hold office at the pleasure of the BOR and that Tapales failed to exhaust administrative remedies. The CFI ruled in favor of Tapales. Respondents appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 1959 BOR resolution limiting terms to five years can validly apply to a Director appointed in a permanent capacity prior to its passage.
2. W/N the petition should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A Dean or Director of the University of the Philippines belongs to the non-competitive or unclassified civil service and is protected by the constitutional and statutory guaranty of security of tenure (Art. XII, Constitution; Rep. Act No. 2260). Such officers cannot be removed or suspended except for cause provided by law and after due process. To apply the 1959 resolution retroactively to Tapales, who held a permanent appointment, would amount to a removal without cause and without hearing. The cause for removal must relate to the character or fitness of the officer, which was not the case here.

2. **NO.** The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply when the question in dispute is purely a legal one, or when the constitutionality of a statute or ordinance is challenged. Since Tapales raised a purely legal question regarding the validity of the BOR resolution, administrative review was not a condition precedent to judicial relief.

The Supreme Court permanently restrained the appellants from enforcing the resolution of October 2, 1959, against Tapales.
