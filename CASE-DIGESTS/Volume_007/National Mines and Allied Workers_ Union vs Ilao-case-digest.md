I. CAPTION
NATIONAL MINES AND ALLIED WORKERS' UNION v. HON. MELQUIADES G. ILAO, et al., G.R. No. L-16884, January 31, 1963. (Ponente not explicitly stated in source).

II. FACTS
On December 19, 1959, Respondent Paracale-Gumaus Consolidated Mining Company, Inc. (Company) entered into a closed-shop agreement with the Camarines Norte Confederation of Miners and Labor Association (Confederation) [1]. On February 16, 1960, Petitioner National Mines and Allied Workers' Union filed a petition for certification election with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), claiming to represent the majority of the employees [1]. Subsequently, the Company dismissed employee Jorge Patinio upon the Confederation's request. In response, Petitioner filed a complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP) against the Company and Confederation on April 5, 1960 [2].

Pending these CIR proceedings, the Company filed a civil action for injunction with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Norte to restrain Petitioner from picketing. On April 9, 1960, Respondent Judge Ilao issued an *ex parte* writ of preliminary injunction against the Petitioner [3]. Petitioner filed the present certiorari to annul the order, arguing the CFI lacked jurisdiction [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to issue an injunction against picketing when certification election and unfair labor practice cases are pending in the Court of Industrial Relations.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the Respondent Judge had no jurisdiction over the subject matter. Since proceedings for certification election and unfair labor practice were pending in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), all matters involved therein fell within the CIR's exclusive jurisdiction [4]. Consequently, the Court of First Instance lacked the authority to issue an anti-picketing injunction—whether final or preliminary—in relation to the matters involved in the pending labor cases [5].

Furthermore, even if the lower court had jurisdiction, the issuance of the preliminary injunction was defective. The Court noted that under Section 9(d) of Republic Act No. 875, a temporary restraining order requires a hearing and the reception of evidence, and is effective for only five days [6, 7]. The lower court erred by following the Rules of Court instead of the specific labor law provisions [7].

Accordingly, the writ of preliminary injunction issued *ex parte* was declared void [8].
