Based on the sources provided, I cannot write a case digest for the decision in *Collado v. Court of Appeals* because the source text provided is not the court decision itself.

The source provided is an **Annotation** titled "**Doctrine of Non-Collateral Attack of a Decree or Title**" [1], written by Judge Domingo Lucenario [2]. While the file header labels it "Collado vs. Court of Appeals," the content is a legal commentary explaining that a decree of registration or Torrens title can only be attacked on the ground of actual fraud within one year, and only through a direct proceeding [1, 3].

The text discusses the doctrine's statutory basis [4] and cites several illustrative cases—such as *Samonte v. Sambilon* [5], *Tuballa v. De la Cruz* [6], and *Mistica v. Caldito* [7]—but it does not contain the specific facts, issues, or ruling of the *Collado v. Court of Appeals* case.

**Would you like me to search for the full text of the *Collado v. Court of Appeals* decision so I can create the digest for you?**
