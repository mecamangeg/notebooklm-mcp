I. CAPTION
ORIENTAL KAPOK INDUSTRIES v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-17837, January 31, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Oriental Kapok Industries is a partnership engaged in the business of buying unhusked kapok and processing it into clean, fluffy kapok sold to manufacturers of mattresses and pillows. The process involves breaking the pods, removing the skins, airing the fiber, and feeding it into a machine called a "separator" to remove seeds and foreign matter [1, 2]. Petitioner paid P7,246.89 in 7% sales tax under Section 186 of the Tax Code but subsequently filed a claim for refund, contending it was not a manufacturer [3, 4]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) denied the claim. On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the CIR, ruling that petitioner's processing constituted manufacturing and that it was not entitled to the exemption for agricultural products under Section 188(b) because it was not the producer or owner of the land where the kapok was grown [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner is a "manufacturer" of kapok liable for sales tax under Section 186 of the Tax Code.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals. Under Section 194(x) of the Tax Code, a "manufacturer" includes any person who alters the exterior texture, form, or quality of raw materials to reduce them to marketable shape or prepare them for industrial use [7]. The Court held that the physical process employed by petitioner—transforming "dry, not-thoroughly-unloosened fiber with seeds" into "light, loose, and fluffy" fiber—created a distinct class of merchandise with its own qualities and uses [8]. Even if the process were not "manufacturing" in the ordinary sense, it constitutes "production," making petitioner a "producer" whose sales are taxable under Section 186 [8]. Furthermore, petitioner cannot invoke the exemption for agricultural products under Section 188(b) of the Tax Code because it merely purchased the raw kapok and was neither the producer nor the owner of the land where it was produced (*Ngo Siek v. Collector of Internal Revenue*) [9]. The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed [10].
