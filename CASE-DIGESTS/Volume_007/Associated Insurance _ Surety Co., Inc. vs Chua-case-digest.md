I. CAPTION
ASSOCIATED INSURANCE & SURETY COMPANY, INC. v. CHUA, et al., G.R. No. L-15656, January 31, 1963.

II. FACTS
On July 29, 1955, Associated Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. (Appellee) posted a bail bond of P1,000.00 for the provisional liberty of Wellington Chua in two criminal cases [1]. Ramon Y. Sy (Appellant) signed an indemnity agreement jointly and severally with Chua in favor of Appellee [1]. The agreement contained a stipulation allowing Appellee to proceed against the indemnitors as soon as Appellee became liable to the obligee, even prior to Appellee making actual payment [2, 3].

Chua failed to appear for trial, causing the confiscation of the bond and a judgment against Appellee on September 1, 1956 [3]. A writ of execution was issued but not enforced because Appellee put up a property bond to guarantee its liabilities [3]. Appellee filed an action against Sy on the indemnity agreement [4]. The trial court ruled in favor of Appellee. Sy appealed, arguing that the stipulation allowing recovery prior to payment was void as against public policy and that Appellee had no cause of action since it had not yet paid the bond [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the stipulation in the indemnity agreement allowing the surety to recover from the indemnitor before the surety has paid the creditor is valid.
2. W/N the surety's cause of action has accrued despite not having paid the judgment on the bond.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The stipulation is valid and not contrary to public policy or morals [4]. The Court distinguished between indemnity against loss and indemnity against liability [6]. While indemnity against loss requires the person indemnified to sustain a loss before the indemnitor becomes liable, an indemnity against **liability**—which is the nature of the agreement in this case—becomes operative as soon as the liability of the person indemnified arises, irrespective of whether they have suffered actual loss [5, 6]. The Appellant’s concern regarding unjust enrichment is a mere contingency that does not invalidate the contract, and the judgment specifies payment is for the benefit of the government [4].

2. **YES.** Appellee's liability is liquidated and was the subject of a final judgment and writ of execution [5]. The fact that the execution had not yet been carried out does not mean the liability is unliquidated [5]. Citing *Alto Surety Insurance, Inc. vs. Alejandro Andan*, the Court ruled that a surety company has a cause of action against an indemnitor even if the surety has not yet satisfied the judgment rendered against it [5].

**Judgment affirmed.** [7]
