I. CAPTION
ALFREDO V. PEREZ v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and PLASTIC, INC., G.R. No. L-18182, February 27, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alfredo V. Perez was employed as a janitor by respondent Plastic, Inc. He was dismissed on July 2, 1958, after a security guard apprehended him carrying a bundle of plastics allegedly stolen from the company [1]. A criminal case for theft was filed against him but was eventually dismissed [1]. Following the dismissal of the criminal charge, Perez sought reinstatement, which Plastic, Inc. denied [1]. He filed a case with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), which dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction [1]. Perez appealed the CIR's decision to the Supreme Court by certiorari [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has jurisdiction over a dismissed employee's claim for reinstatement based solely on the dismissal of a criminal charge filed against him.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's decision, holding that the lower court correctly dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction [1, 2].

The Court explained that under Republic Act No. 875, the jurisdiction of the CIR is limited to four specific instances: (1) labor disputes affecting an industry indispensable to the national interest and certified by the President; (2) controversies involving the Minimum Wage Law (Republic Act No. 602); (3) controversies involving the Eight-Hour Labor Law (Commonwealth Act No. 444); and (4) cases involving Unfair Labor Practice [3].

Perez's case did not involve a presidential certification, Unfair Labor Practice, or claims under the Minimum Wage or Eight-Hour Labor Laws [4]. He merely claimed a right to reinstatement predicated on the dismissal of the theft charge against him [4]. Since the cause of action did not fall under any of the specified categories, the CIR had no jurisdiction over the subject matter [4].

**Disposition:** The decision and resolution appealed from are affirmed, with costs against petitioner [2].
