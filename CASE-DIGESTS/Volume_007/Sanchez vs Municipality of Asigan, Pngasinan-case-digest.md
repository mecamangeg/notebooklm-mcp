I. CAPTION
EDUARDO SANCHEZ, GREGORIO NUÑEZ, SULPICIO BANAAG, LINO BASA and RODOLFO FERNANDEZ v. MUNICIPALITY OF ASINGAN, G.R. No. L-17635, March 30, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
The respondent Municipality of Asigan is the owner of a triangular strip of land situated between the municipal school building and the provincial road [1]. Shortly after the war, petitioners constructed temporary stores on this land with the Municipality's implied consent and paid rents from 1952 to 1959 [1]. Following the 1959 elections, the new municipal administration passed a resolution declaring the land necessary for public purposes (parking, school expansion, and road widening) and notified petitioners to vacate by May 15, 1960 [1]. Instead of vacating, petitioners filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan to stop the ejectment or, alternatively, to claim reimbursement of rents paid totaling P1,178.20 [1]. The CFI dismissed the petition and ordered petitioners to vacate [1]. Petitioners appealed, arguing the land belonged to the Province and citing *Rojas v. Municipality of Cavite* to demand reimbursement [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Municipality has the right to eject the petitioners.
2. W/N the petitioners are entitled to a reimbursement of rents paid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court upheld the trial court's factual finding that the land is owned by the Municipality, which is not subject to review on appeal [2, 4]. The Court found the land to be patrimonial in character, as it was not included in the categories of municipal properties for public use (e.g., streets, squares) enumerated in Article 424 of the Civil Code when petitioners began their occupancy [3]. Consequently, the implied lease agreement was valid, though terminable upon notice, which the Municipality properly exercised [3, 5].

2. **NO.** Since the implied lease was valid (patrimonial property), there is no legal ground to order a reimbursement of rents [3, 5]. Even assuming *arguendo* that the land was for public use and the lease was void, the Court ruled there is no justification for reimbursement because petitioners had already occupied the land and derived benefits from it [5, 6]. Returning the rents would constitute unjust enrichment to the prejudice of the Municipality [5, 6]. Furthermore, petitioners are estopped from claiming the land is public in character to recover payments, having treated it as patrimonial property by paying rents [7].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [7].
