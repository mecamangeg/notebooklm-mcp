I. CAPTION
FLORENCIO MORENO, Secretary of Public Works, et al. v. HON. HIGINIO MACADAEG, et al., G.R. No. L-17908, April 23, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Jose Carreon, et al. (laborers) filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against Juan Sumerariz (contractor), the surety, and Petitioners (officials of the Bureau of Public Works) for unpaid wages amounting to P16,382.36 regarding the construction of the National Orthopedic Hospital. They sought payment from the retention fund withheld by the Bureau. Sumerariz filed a cross-claim against Petitioners for damages due to the alleged arbitrary rescission of the construction contract.

Petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss the complaint and cross-claim on two grounds: (1) failure to state a cause of action, arguing that under the contract, no claims could be settled until the work was completed and liquidated; and (2) improper venue, arguing that under Act No. 3688, the suit should be filed in Quezon City where the contract was performed. Respondent Judge Macadaeg denied the motion. Petitioners then filed this petition for prohibition to enjoin the Judge from proceeding with the case.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the denial of the motion to dismiss may be corrected by a writ of prohibition.
2. W/N the venue was properly laid in the CFI of Manila.
3. W/N the action constitutes a suit against the Government without its consent.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** An order denying a motion to dismiss is merely interlocutory. Unless it constitutes clearly a grave abuse of discretion or was issued without or in excess of jurisdiction, the error must be corrected by appeal in due time after trial and judgment on the merits, not by the extraordinary writ of prohibition [1, 2]. The Court found that the grounds relied upon were not indubitable, as the contract stipulation regarding final liquidation does not necessarily prohibit the payment of laborers' wages which had already been adjudicated by the Department of Labor [2].

2. **YES.** While Act No. 3688 provides that suits on the bond for public works should be brought in the district where the contract was performed, Section 1 of Republic Act No. 1171 specifically allows civil actions on claims of employees and laborers to be commenced "in the court of competent jurisdiction... where the plaintiff or any of the plaintiff resides, at the election of the plaintiff" [1, 3].

3. **NO.** The action is not a suit against the Government. It is an action to compel the officials to release the amount claimed from funds that have "already set aside and retained for that purpose" [3, 4].

The petition is **DENIED**.
