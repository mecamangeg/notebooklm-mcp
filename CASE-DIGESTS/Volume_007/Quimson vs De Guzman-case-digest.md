I. CAPTION
SOFRONIO C. QUIMSON, ET AL. v. THE HON. PASTOR L. DE GUZMAN and ISIDRO TUGADE, G.R. No. L-18240, January 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Isidro Tugade is a tenant of petitioners (Quimson, et al.) on a 2.6-hectare riceland in Pangasinan. In October 1959, petitioners filed a complaint with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) seeking Tugade’s ejectment and payment of unpaid rentals. The grounds for ejectment alleged were: (1) petitioners' intention to personally cultivate the land, for which they sent notice in May 1957; (2) Tugade’s cultivation of another parcel of land owned by a Mrs. Castro; and (3) Tugade’s failure to adopt the "Masagana" planting system. Petitioners also claimed Tugade failed to pay the agreed rental of 1,495 kilograms of palay. The CAR ruled in favor of the tenant. Petitioners appealed, raising for the first time the constitutionality of the security of tenure provisions of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 1199.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the tenant may be ejected for failure to pay the claimed rentals.
2. W/N the tenant may be ejected based on the landlords' notice of intention to personally cultivate the land.
3. W/N the tenant may be ejected for cultivating another parcel of land or failing to use the "Masagana" system.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the land is second class because the normal harvest for the three preceding years did not exceed 40 cavanes per hectare [1]. Under Section 46 of R.A. No. 1199, the maximum rental for second class riceland is 25% of the gross produce [2]. Calculating based on the land area and classification, the maximum allowable rental was only roughly 26.64 cavanes. The petitioners' demand of 1,495 kilos (approx. 34 cavanes) exceeded the statutory limit and is therefore unenforceable [3].

2. **NO.** A mere notice of intention to cultivate is insufficient to dispossess a tenant. R.A. No. 1199 requires the landholder to secure certifications from the Agricultural Tenancy Commission and the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA), or the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources [4][5]. Petitioners failed to present these required certifications [5].

3. **NO.** Regarding the cultivation of another parcel, the punitive provisions of R.A. No. 1199 cannot be applied retroactively. Petitioners failed to prove that the second holding was acquired after the law took effect on August 30, 1954, or that the tenant neglected the petitioners' land [6][7]. Regarding the "Masagana" system, failure to apply it does not justify ejectment absent proof that the land was actually suited for such method [8][7].

Finally, the Court declined to address the constitutionality of R.A. No. 1199 as it was not raised in the lower court [9].

**Petition DENIED. Decision affirmed.**
