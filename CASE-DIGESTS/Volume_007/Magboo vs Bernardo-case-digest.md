I. CAPTION
URBANO MAGBOO and EMILIA C. MAGBOO v. DELFIN BERNARDO, G.R. No. L-16790, April 30, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On October 24, 1956, 8-year-old Cesar Magboo was killed in an accident involving a passenger jeepney owned by Delfin Bernardo and driven by Conrado Roque [1]. Roque operated under a "boundary system," paying Bernardo P8.00 for the privilege of driving and retaining any excess earnings, while paying for his own gasoline [1]. Roque pleaded guilty to homicide thru reckless imprudence and was sentenced to imprisonment and to indemnify the heirs P3,000.00 [2]. Due to Roque's insolvency, the victim's parents, Urbano and Emilia Magboo, filed an action against Bernardo to enforce his subsidiary liability under Art. 103 of the Revised Penal Code [3, 4]. Bernardo argued that the "boundary system" created a lessor-lessee relationship rather than an employer-employee relationship, exempting him from liability [4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the Magboos [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an employer-employee relationship exists between a jeepney owner and a driver under the "boundary system" regarding subsidiary liability under Art. 103 of the Revised Penal Code.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that an employer-employee relationship exists between a jeepney owner and a driver under a "boundary system" arrangement [5]. The distinctive features of this system—where the driver does not receive a fixed wage but retains the excess of fares over the boundary paid to the owner, and pays for gasoline—are insufficient to withdraw the relationship from that of employer and employee [4, 5]. This principle, previously applied in labor disputes (*National Labor Union v. Dinglasan*), applies with greater reason to negligence cases involving third parties [4, 6]. To exempt a public vehicle owner from liability on the theory that they are a mere lessor would abet violations of the Public Service Law and endanger the public by placing them at the mercy of reckless and irresponsible drivers (*Erezo v. Jepte*) [6]. Thus, the owner is subsidiarily liable under Art. 103 of the Revised Penal Code [6]. The judgment is affirmed [7].
