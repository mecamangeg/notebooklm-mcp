I. CAPTION
CANDIDA PIANO v. GENEROSA CAYANONG, REGALADO BELLONES and FRANCISCO PILAPIL, G.R. No. L-18603, February 28, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Cayanong and Bellones filed a complaint to foreclose a mortgage against petitioner Piano. The parties submitted a compromise agreement wherein Piano admitted the P2,000 debt and agreed to pay within 30 days, stipulating that failure to pay would place the security at the court's disposal. The trial court rendered judgment based on this compromise [1-3]. Piano failed to pay, and the property was sold at public auction to respondents. The Sheriff’s certificate of sale contained a provision stating the property was subject to redemption within one year [4]. The court confirmed the sale on March 21, 1953. On January 26, 1954, Piano deposited redemption money, but the lower court denied her right to redeem [4-6]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the judgment based on the compromise agreement was valid despite lacking specific findings of fact.
2. W/N the execution of the judgment should be governed by Rule 39 (ordinary execution with 1-year redemption) instead of Rule 70 (foreclosure).
3. W/N the Sheriff's insertion of a one-year redemption period in the certificate of sale granted the petitioner the right to redeem after confirmation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The trial court had no necessity of making findings of fact because the parties entered into a compromise agreement to terminate the suit, which has the effect and authority of *res judicata* upon the parties under Article 2037 of the New Civil Code [8]. A judgment on a compromise is immediately executory and not appealable unless a motion is filed to set it aside for fraud, mistake, or duress [9].
2. **NO.** The purpose of the suit and the law governing it are determined by the complaint itself, which in this case was for the foreclosure of a mortgage [10]. No judgment in a foreclosure action can be executed otherwise than in the manner prescribed by the law on mortgages (Rule 70), and parties cannot change this procedure [11, 12].
3. **NO.** In a foreclosure of mortgage under Rule 70, there is no right of redemption after the sale is confirmed, although there is an equity of redemption before confirmation [11, 13, 14]. The Sheriff has no authority to insert a period of redemption in the certificate of sale when the foreclosure is under Rule 70; such insertion is surplusage, void, and must be disregarded [14, 15]. The petition is denied and the decision is affirmed [16].
