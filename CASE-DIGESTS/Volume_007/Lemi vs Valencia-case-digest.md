I. CAPTION
ELISEO B. LEMI v. BRIGIDO VALENCIA, et al., [G.R. Number and Date not provided in source], Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Eliseo B. Lemi operated radio station DZQR. He held a license that expired in May 1961 and filed for renewal in 1961 and 1962. The Radio Control Office took no action on these applications but allowed him to continue operating without interference, creating a presumption of no objection [1, 2].

On January 11, 1963, respondents (Secretary of Public Works Brigido Valencia, et al.) obtained a search warrant and seized the station's transmitter while it was broadcasting, effectively closing the station [3-5]. Respondents alleged Lemi was using an unauthorized transmitter lacking a nameplate, while Lemi contended it was the authorized unit which had been repainted [6, 7]. Lemi filed an original action for Mandamus with the Supreme Court, seeking a preliminary mandatory injunction to return the transmitter [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the seizure of the radio transmitter under a search warrant was valid despite the lack of a prior hearing.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the seizure violated the petitioner's right to a hearing. Section 3 of the Radio Control Act and Section 17 of Department Order No. 11 prohibit the disapproval of a license renewal or the revocation of a license without giving the licensee a hearing [5, 8].

Although the license was not formally revoked, the Court held that the requirement of a hearing applies to any action by the Radio Control Office that practically amounts to a revocation by making it impossible for the station to broadcast [9, 10]. The fact that the seizure was conducted under a search warrant did not validate the action; rather, the application for the warrant was deemed an effort to evade the law requiring a hearing [10, 11]. Finding that the petitioner's rights were willfully invaded and the injury was continuing, the Court granted the preliminary mandatory injunction to re-establish the pre-existing relation between the parties [12, 13].

**Petition for preliminary mandatory injunction granted.**
