I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RAUL BASBANIO, REYNALDO ALIMODIAN and DEMETRIO ALIMODIAN, G.R. No. L-16489, January 31, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On March 28, 1958, in the public market of Barotac Viejo, Iloilo, Cpl. Gonzalo Avanceña, a policeman in uniform, confronted Raul Basbanio regarding a complaint filed by a "tuba" vendor. While Avanceña and Basbanio were walking toward the police station, the officer was suddenly surrounded by Basbanio and his co-accused, Reynaldo and Demetrio Alimodian. Basbanio stabbed Avanceña in the front, while the Alimodians stabbed him in the back. The three wrestled with the officer, holding his hands to wrest his gun, which Demetrio eventually snatched. Avanceña died from shock and severe hemorrhage due to seven deep stab wounds. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo convicted the three accused of murder with assault upon an agent of a person in authority and sentenced them to death. The accused appealed, claiming self-defense and non-participation.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused are guilty of the complex crime of murder with assault upon an agent of a person in authority qualified by treachery.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty. The Court ruled that treachery was present because, although the victim was armed with a gun, the sudden combined assault by the three appellants—stabbing him from the front, side, and back while holding his hands—rendered him defenseless and insured the execution of the crime without risk to themselves [1, 2]. The offense committed is the complex crime of murder with assault upon an agent of a person in authority under Articles 248 and 148 of the Revised Penal Code [3]. Under Article 48 of the same Code, the penalty for the most serious crime (death) must be imposed [3]. Although the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender was present, it cannot reduce the penalty prescribed by law for complex crimes [4]. However, due to the lack of sufficient votes required by the Judiciary Act of 1948 to impose the death penalty, the sentence was reduced to *reclusion perpetua*, and the judgment was affirmed with modification [4].
