I. CAPTION
NATIONAL SHIPYARDS AND STEEL CORPORATION v. JOSE CALIXTO, THE SHERIFF OF THE CITY OF MANILA and THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE REGIONAL OFFICE NO. 3, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, G.R. No. L-18471, February 28, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Jose Calixto, an employee of National Shipyards and Steel Corporation, was issued several workmen's compensation awards by the Administrator of Regional Office No. 3, Department of Labor. The corporation paid the first two awards but contested the third award of P3,096.69 (dated July 22, 1960) because the company physician certified Calixto was 100% fit to work, contradicting the Regional Office's finding of 60% disability.

On November 14, 1960, the Administrator issued a writ of execution to enforce the award. Consequently, the Sheriff of Manila levied upon the corporation's car. The corporation filed a petition for prohibition and injunction with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI rendered judgment declaring the Administrator's award and the writ of execution null and void, ruling that the Regional Office lacked jurisdiction. Calixto and the Sheriff appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A empowered the Regional Office to decide money claims and issue writs of execution.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Reorganization Plan No. 20-A validly confers judicial power to Regional Offices of the Department of Labor to adjudicate money claims.
2. W/N Regional Offices of the Department of Labor have the authority to issue writs of execution to enforce their awards.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is null and void insofar as it confers judicial power to Regional Offices of the Department of Labor to adjudicate money claims. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Stoll v. Mardo* and *Davao Far Eastern Commercial Co. v. Montemayor* regarding the invalidity of the grant of judicial power under said Plan [1].

2. **NO.** Regional Offices are not empowered to order the execution of their awards by writs of execution; only courts of justice have such power. In cases falling under the Workmen's Compensation Act, Regional Offices may act as referees and submit reports to the Workmen's Compensation Commission. While the Commission may render final awards, these must be executed by writs issued by courts of justice, not the administrative bodies themselves [2, 3].

The judgment of the lower court is AFFIRMED.
