I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AMBROSIA VALLE and ALTO SURETY AND INSURANCE CO., INC., G.R. No. L-18044, April 30, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Ambrosia Valle, accused of estafa, was convicted by the Municipal Court of Manila and appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI), posting a P500 appeal bond subscribed by Alto Surety & Insurance Co., Inc. The bond conditioned that Valle would appear and answer charges, hold herself amenable to court orders, and surrender for execution of judgment [1, 2]. On September 14, 1959, the CFI convicted Valle and ordered her to appear on September 29, the last day to appeal, to perfect her appeal. Valle appeared on the morning of September 29 requesting until the afternoon to file her notice of appeal. The court granted this, but Valle failed to return [3]. Consequently, on October 1, 1959, the court ordered the bond confiscated and issued a warrant of arrest. Alto Surety surrendered Valle on October 14 and moved to lift the confiscation, which the trial court denied [4]. Alto Surety appealed, arguing the court erred in releasing the accused without its consent and postponing execution of judgment.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in postponing the execution of judgment until the last day of the appeal period.
2. W/N the surety is liable for the bond confiscation despite the subsequent surrender of the accused.
3. W/N the surety’s liability should be reduced.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The lower court had the discretion to postpone the determination of whether to order the defendant's detention or the execution of the judgment until the last day for the perfection of the appeal, as the defendant was entitled to appeal [5].

2. **YES.** The surety's liability under the bond continued until after the accused had been surrendered and the court had ordered the cancellation of the bond [6]. Citing *People v. Lorredo* (50 Phil. 218), the Court held that the specific conditions of the bond required the accused to be amenable to the court's orders. Neither the grant of time to the accused nor the lack of immediate execution relieves the surety of liability without a judicial order cancelling the bond [6].

3. **NO.** The reduction of a surety’s liability upon the surrender of the accused is a matter left to the sound discretion of the court [7, 8]. The Supreme Court ruled that the lower court’s refusal to reduce liability was justified because the surety had misrepresented in its motion to lift confiscation that the court had granted the accused two days to file her appeal, which was untrue [7, 8].

The orders appealed from are affirmed [9].
