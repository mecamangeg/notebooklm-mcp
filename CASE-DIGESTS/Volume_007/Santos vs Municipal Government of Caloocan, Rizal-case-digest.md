I. CAPTION
INES SANTOS, ET AL. v. THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT OF CALOOCAN, RIZAL, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15807, April 22, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
In September 1946, the Municipal Council of Caloocan passed Ordinance No. 24 pursuant to Commonwealth Act (C.A.) No. 655. The ordinance imposed "Slaughterhouse fees" alongside separate "Internal Organs fees," "Meat Inspection fees," and "Corral fees." Petitioners, meat vendors, paid these fees but questioned their legality via formal letters to the Municipal Treasurer and the Secretary of the Interior. Despite the Provincial Board revoking the ordinance upon the Provincial Fiscal's opinion that it was illegal, the Municipality continued its enforcement and refused refunds. Petitioners filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to declare the ordinance null and void. The CFI ruled in favor of petitioners, ordering an accounting and refund. The Municipality appealed, arguing the ordinance was valid, the payments were not made under protest (as receipts were not stamped), and the claim had prescribed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the imposition of internal organs fees, meat inspection fees, and corral fees under Ordinance No. 24 is valid.
2. W/N the failure to stamp receipts "paid under protest" bars the recovery of fees.
3. W/N the action for refund is barred by prescription under Section 306 of the National Internal Revenue Code.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that C.A. No. 655 only empowers municipalities to charge "reasonable slaughter fees." By ordaining the payment of internal organs, meat inspection, and corral fees in addition to slaughter fees, the Municipality overstepped the limits of its statutory grant [1]. Distinguishing between slaughter fees on dressed meat and internal organs is not sanctioned by the law [2]. Furthermore, exacting these additional fees constitutes a revenue measure, which requires an express grant of taxing power and cannot be implied from the mere power to license and regulate under police power (*Cu Unjieng v. Patstone*) [3, 4]. However, the invalid portions are severable; the ordinance remains valid regarding the "slaughterhouse fees" but is void regarding the other three fees [5, 6].

2. **NO.** Although the official receipts were not stamped "paid under protest," the written letters of objection sent by petitioners to the Municipal Treasurer and the Secretary of the Interior constitute conclusive evidence that the payments were made involuntarily and over vehement protests [7].

3. **NO.** Section 306 of the National Internal Revenue Code, which requires actions for recovery of tax to be filed within two years, applies exclusively to "national internal revenue tax" erroneously or illegally collected. It does not apply to claims for the refund of "local or municipal license fees" [8].

The decision is **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**. The Municipality is ordered to refund the amounts collected for internal organs fees, meat inspection fees, and corral fees [8].
