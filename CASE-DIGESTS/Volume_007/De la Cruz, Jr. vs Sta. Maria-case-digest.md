I. CAPTION
SERVILLANO DE LA CRUZ, JR. and CRISANTO DE LA CRUZ v. ASUNCION D. STA. MARIA, et al., G.R. No. L-17928, April 30, 1963.

II. FACTS
In a foreclosure suit filed by Tiu Kian Hem against the Estate of Luis Domingo, Sr., the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan rendered judgment in favor of the creditor. On July 29, 1960, the mortgaged properties were sold at public auction to petitioners Servillano and Crisanto De la Cruz as the highest bidders. On October 12, 1960, the trial court issued an order confirming the sale [1, 2].

On November 10, 1960, respondents (the administratrix and heirs) filed a motion for reconsideration, assailing the validity of the sale due to the unconscionably low price and praying to be allowed to redeem the property. On December 2, 1960, the trial court reconsidered its previous order, setting aside the confirmation and granting the respondents ten days to redeem the property, which they did on December 8, 1960 [3].

Petitioners moved to set aside the December 2 order, arguing that the October 12 confirmation was already final and irrevocable. The trial court denied this motion. Petitioners then filed a petition for certiorari, alleging the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion [3-5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the remedy of certiorari lies against the trial court's order setting aside the confirmation of the sale.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the extraordinary remedy of certiorari cannot be availed of because an appeal is the plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

An order confirming a public auction sale does not become final and executory until after the expiration of the reglementary period for appeal. The filing of a motion for reconsideration within this period, specifically one that assails the validity of the sale (e.g., inadequacy of price), suspends the running of the period for the perfection of an appeal [6, 7].

Since the respondents filed their motion for reconsideration on November 10, 1960, the case was still within the jurisdiction of the trial court. Therefore, the order setting aside the confirmation and allowing redemption did not constitute grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction [5, 8]. The petition for certiorari is denied.
