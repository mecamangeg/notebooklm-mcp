I. CAPTION
JUAN ALQUIGUE v. FORTUNATO DE LEON and FILEMON Q. ALMAZAN, G.R. No. L-15059, March 30, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Juan Alquigue filed a complaint for damages against defendants Fortunato De Leon and Filemon Q. Almazan, both lawyers. Alquigue alleged that the defendants negligently supervised the execution of his late wife's will in 1951 by failing to ensure it was acknowledged before a notary public as required by the New Civil Code [1], [2]. Consequently, the will was denied probate [2]. The probate court found that the date of the will was altered to "1950" to evade the new requirement and that Alquigue, aided by Almazan, employed force upon the testatrix [3], [4]. Alquigue further alleged that Almazan negligently failed to appeal the denial of probate despite instructions to do so [2].

The defendants filed motions to dismiss. The trial court dismissed the complaint on two grounds: (1) Alquigue came to court with "unclean hands" due to the probate court's finding of force/fraud; and (2) the action had prescribed, reckoning the period from the date of the will's execution [5]. Alquigue appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the complaint states a cause of action sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.
2. W/N the action for damages has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The allegations in the complaint—that the will was void due to the lawyers' negligence in omitting the notarial acknowledgment and that they failed to appeal the adverse decision—are sufficient to constitute a cause of action [6]. To test the sufficiency of a cause of action, a motion to dismiss must hypothetically admit the truth of the allegations [6]. The defendants' denials and defenses (e.g., that Almazan was relieved of his duties) are matters of defense to be proven at trial, not grounds for dismissal [7]. Furthermore, the "unclean hands" doctrine does not justify dismissal because, irrespective of the alleged force employed by Alquigue, the will would have been void regardless due to the lack of notarial acknowledgment caused by the defendants' negligence [8].

2. **NO.** The lower court erred in counting the prescriptive period from the date of the will's execution. The cause of action accrued only when the probate court's decision became final in 1956 due to the alleged negligence in failing to perfect an appeal [9]. Since the complaint was filed on April 14, 1958, it was well within the four-year prescriptive period provided under Article 1146 of the Civil Code [9].

The order appealed from is set aside and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [10].
