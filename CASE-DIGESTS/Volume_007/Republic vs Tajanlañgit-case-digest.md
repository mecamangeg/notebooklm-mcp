I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CLASICO TAJANLANGIT, G.R. No. L-17324, April 22, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
The Republic sued Clasico Tajanlangit in the Justice of the Peace Court to recover P110.88 for nine sacks of fertilizer purchased from the Fertilizer Administration. Tajanlangit refused to pay, alleging false representations and that the fertilizer harmed his crops [1]. The lower court ruled against him. On appeal to the Court of First Instance, the Republic failed to appear at trial on two occasions [2]. The judge dismissed the action for lack of interest as the case had been pending for about three years [2]. The Republic moved for reconsideration based on excusable negligence, arguing its attorney was unaware of the case due to the volume of papers from the abolished Fertilizer Administration [2]. The motion was denied, and the case was eventually certified to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial judge committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to re-open the case due to excusable negligence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the trial judge committed no plain abuse of discretion [4]. The alleged negligence referred to circumstances arising in November 1956 (after the agency was abolished) and failed to account for the plaintiff's non-appearance at the first hearing on July 20, 1956 [3]. Furthermore, the affidavit of merit was insufficient as it merely cited the promissory note already on record and did not refute the defendant's defense that the fertilizer was harmful [3]. The Court noted that given the meager claim of P110.88 compared to litigation costs, the government should have declined to prosecute the appeal [5]. Judgment affirmed [6].
