I. CAPTION
CANDIDA VILLALUZ, ET AL. v. JUAN NEME and FELICISIMA VILLAFRANCA, G.R. No. L-14676, January 31, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Maria Rocabo died intestate in 1937, leaving a homestead covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 217. She was survived by three daughters (Sinforosa, Patricia, and Maria) and several grandchildren (plaintiffs-appellants) representing her deceased children [1, 2].

On September 1, 1939, the three living daughters executed a deed of extrajudicial partition, fraudulently claiming to be the sole heirs and excluding the plaintiffs. OCT No. 217 was cancelled and Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 269 was issued in their names [2]. They subsequently sold the land to vendees whose successors-in-interest eventually sold it to defendants-appellees Juan Neme and Felicisima Villafranca in 1953 [2, 3]. These sales were never registered under the Public Land Act or Land Registration Act [4].

In 1954, the excluded grandchildren filed a complaint for partition and recovery of shares. The lower court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the defendants were the owners and that the plaintiffs’ action had prescribed under Rule 73, Section 4 of the Rules of Court [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the extrajudicial partition and subsequent sales are valid and binding against the excluded heirs.
2. W/N the plaintiffs' right to demand partition is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the deed of extrajudicial partition was fraudulent and vicious because it was executed without the knowledge and consent of the co-heirs [6]. Consequently, the partition and the subsequent sales did not prejudice the interest and participation of the excluded plaintiffs. The three sisters could not sell what did not belong to them (*nemo dat quod non habet*) [6]. Furthermore, the sales to the defendants were not registered; under *Tuason v. Raymundo*, registration is the operative act that transmits title in voluntary sales of land [7]. The defendants' bad faith was inferred from their failure to register the sales or annotate them on the title [8].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that Section 4, Rule 73 applies only to settlements made in good faith by heirs believing they are the only successors [5]. Since Maria Rocabo died during the regime of the Spanish Civil Code, Article 1965 thereof applies, providing that the right to demand partition among co-heirs does not prescribe [5]. The three sisters held the property as administratrices or trustees for the excluded heirs [7]. There was no effective repudiation of this trust to trigger prescription or laches, and the plaintiffs' contention was found meritorious [8, 9].
