I. CAPTION
JOSE B. YUSAY v. JUANITO TUGBA, ABRAHAM RUBI and HON. PASTOR P. REYES, G.R. No. L-16347, February 27, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In March 1958, respondents Tugba and Rubi, tenants of petitioner Yusay, filed petitions with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) seeking the reliquidation of their palay produce for agricultural years 1952-53 to 1956-57. They alleged they were "short-shared" and did not receive their full portion of the harvest. Yusay raised the defense of prescription for the years 1952-53 to 1954-55, relying on Section 17 of Republic Act No. 1199, which limits the right to demand a written accounting to three years. The CAR ruled in favor of the tenants, ordering Yusay to pay the undelivered shares, and denied his motion for reconsideration, ruling that an action for accounting is distinct from reliquidation [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the tenants' cause of action for reliquidation for the agricultural years 1952-53 to 1954-55 has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that an action for reliquidation is not the same as an action for accounting. Citing *Benson v. Ocampo*, the Court explained that an **accounting** is a statement of contributions, expenses, and harvest, while a **reliquidation** involves the determination of the specific share each party is entitled to based on facts or accounting [4, 5].

While Section 17 of R.A. 1199 sets a three-year prescriptive period for demanding a written accounting, the law is silent regarding reliquidation. Therefore, the Civil Code applies. Under Article 1145(1) of the Civil Code, an action based on an oral contract prescribes in six years. Since the tenants filed their petition within this period, their claims had not prescribed [6, 7].

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
