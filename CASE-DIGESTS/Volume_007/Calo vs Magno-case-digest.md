I. CAPTION
MARCOS M. CALO vs. FRANCISCO MAGNO, G.R. No. L-18399, February 28, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Marcos Calo filed a petition for injunction and damages to restrain respondent Francisco Magno, the Acting City Treasurer of Butuan, from enforcing a distraint and levy on Calo’s properties for unpaid real property taxes. Calo argued that Magno had no authority to issue the order because his designation was void. The regular City Treasurer, Quirico Battad, Sr., had been detailed to the Department of Finance in Manila with the President's approval. Consequently, the President designated Magno as Acting City Treasurer under Commonwealth Act (C.A.) No. 588. Calo contended that under Republic Act No. 523 (Charter of the City of Butuan), the Assistant City Treasurer (Calo's brother-in-law) should have automatically assumed the duties during Battad's absence, rendering the President's intervention unnecessary and illegal. The Court of First Instance of Agusan dismissed the petition, ruling that a vacancy existed which the President validly filled.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the designation of respondent Magno as Acting City Treasurer by the President was valid.
2. W/N an injunction lies to restrain the collection of the tax.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The designation was valid. The Supreme Court held that the regular incumbent's (Battad) detail to the Department of Finance, followed by the President's designation of Magno and Magno's assumption of office without Battad's objection, resulted in Battad being deemed to have abandoned his position. This created a "vacancy" in the office of the City Treasurer, rather than a mere "absence" or "inability to act" under Section 18 of the City Charter. Since there was a vacancy, the specific provision of the Charter regarding succession by the next ranking officer did not apply. Instead, the President was authorized to designate a temporary replacement under Section 1 of C.A. No. 588, which allows such designation "in case of vacancy in the office."

2. **NO.** The Court reiterated the established principle that no action lies to enjoin the collection of a tax, citing *David v. Ramos*.

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Concepcion, J. (Concurring in the result):** Disagreed that the incumbent abandoned the office or that a vacancy existed, as a "designation" is inherently temporary. However, he concurred because the respondent was at least a *de facto* officer. His title to the office cannot be questioned collaterally in an injunction suit but only through *quo warranto* proceedings initiated by the Solicitor General or a person claiming the office.

**Reyes, J.B.L., J. (Concurring in the result):** Noted that the petitioner had no personality to question the respondent's title to the office. Doubts regarding the legality of a Treasurer's appointment do not excuse the non-payment of taxes.
