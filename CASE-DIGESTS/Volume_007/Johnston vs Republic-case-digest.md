I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MINOR, ANA ISABEL HENRIETTE ANTONIA CONCEPCION GEORGIANA, ISABEL VALDES JOHNSTON v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18284, April 30, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On June 24, 1960, petitioner Isabel Valdes Johnston filed a petition to adopt a minor. While her husband, Raymond Arthur Johnston, consented to the adoption, he did not join the petition as a co-adopter. The Court of First Instance of Rizal granted the adoption but decreed that the child bear the surname "Valdes," the petitioner's maiden name. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the child should be allowed to use the surname "Valdes Johnston" because that is the name she (petitioner) uses and is known by. She contended that restricting the child to her maiden name would create the impression that the child is her illegitimate offspring born before wedlock.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the adopted child is entitled to use the surname of the petitioner's husband, which the petitioner uses by virtue of marriage.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision prescribing the use of the surname "Valdes." The Court held that Article 341, paragraph 4 of the Civil Code, which entitles the adopted minor to the use of the adopter's surname, refers to the adopter's own original family surname and not to the surname acquired by virtue of marriage [1, 2].

Since the petitioner adopted the child individually without the concurrence of her husband as a co-adopter, the husband is not an adopting father. Allowing the child to use the husband's surname would mislead the public into believing the husband had also adopted the child [2, 3]. Furthermore, it could cause confusion regarding successional rights, as the husband's consent could be potentially misused to prove he joined the adoption [4]. Therefore, strict application of the Civil Code requires the child to use the surname of the adopter herself ("Valdes"), not the name she acquired by marriage [4]. The order of the lower court is affirmed [5].
