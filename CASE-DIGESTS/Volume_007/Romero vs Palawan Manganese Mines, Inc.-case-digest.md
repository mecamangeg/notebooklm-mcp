I. CAPTION
DANIEL ROMERO, et al. v. PALAWAN MANGANESE MINES, INC., et al., G.R. No. L-16998, April 24, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners (Romero et al., doing business as Kalawag Mining Enterprises) located the *Malcocobi No. 1* mining claim in Coron, Palawan in 1936. Respondent Palawan Manganese Mines, Inc. subsequently relocated a claim (*San Nicolas Lode Claim No. 4*) covering the same area in 1937 [1]. Conflicting lease applications ensued. In 1950, the Director of Mines granted Respondent a temporary permit to extract manganese ore, under which Respondent extracted 258 tons [2].

While the Director of Mines initially ruled in favor of Respondent, the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources reversed this on appeal, recognizing Petitioners' rights to the disputed area. This administrative decision became final [3]. Petitioners then filed an action for damages in the Court of First Instance of Manila to recover the value of the 258 tons of ore extracted by Respondent, arguing the Secretary's decision granted them the "absolute right to exploit" the claim [4, 5]. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that Petitioners only held a preferential right to lease and had not yet complied with all legal requirements to exploit the claim [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioners are entitled to damages for the ore extracted by respondent based on the administrative decision recognizing their rights.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the petitioners have no cause of action for damages. The administrative decision relied upon merely recognized their **preferential right to take the lease** from the government over the mining claim [6]. Petitioners cannot claim ownership or the "absolute right to exploit and enjoy said mining claim" because, as found by the Court of Appeals, their lease application was still pending action due to their failure to comply with all the requirements of the law on the subject [7]. The Court emphasized that the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals regarding this non-compliance are supported by evidence and are not reviewable on appeal by *certiorari* [6, 8].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [9].
