I. CAPTION
IN RE: ADOPTION OF CHILD BAPTIZED UNDER THE NAME OF ROSE, MARVIN G. ELLIS and GLORIA C. ELLIS v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16922, April 30, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Marvin and Gloria Ellis are citizens of the United States [1]. Marvin was a Staff Sergeant in the U.S. Air Force assigned to the base in Angeles, Pampanga [1, 2]. At the time of the hearing, they had been living in the Philippines for three years due to this assignment [2]. They filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pampanga to adopt Baby Rose, a Filipino child abandoned by her mother at the Heart of Mary Villa [1]. The CFI granted the petition [1]. The Republic appealed the decision, arguing that the petitioners are disqualified from adopting under Philippine law [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners, being aliens temporarily assigned to a US military base in the Philippines, are qualified to adopt a Filipino child.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioners are disqualified because Article 335 of the Civil Code explicitly provides that "non-resident aliens" cannot adopt [2, 3].

The Court explained that adoption is a proceeding *in rem*, which requires the court to have jurisdiction over the *res*—specifically the personal status of both the child and the adopting parents [4, 5]. Under Article 15 of the Civil Code (nationality theory), Philippine courts do not have jurisdiction over the status of the petitioners because they are foreigners [4, 5]. Furthermore, even under the domiciliary theory followed by the Anglo-American system, the petitioners are not domiciled in the Philippines but are merely assigned here for military service [4, 5]. Consequently, the Philippine courts cannot assume jurisdiction over their status [6].

The decision of the Court of First Instance is **REVERSED** and the petition for adoption is **DENIED** [7].
