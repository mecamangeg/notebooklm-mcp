I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FREDERICK G. WEBER; FIELDMEN’S INSURANCE CO., INC., G.R. No. L-18746, January 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Fieldmen’s Insurance Co., Inc. posted a P3,500.00 bond for the provisional liberty of Frederick G. Weber, a German alien charged with Falsification of Public or Official Document [1]. Weber failed to appear for his arraignment on February 3, 1960 [1]. Although his counsel claimed he was ill, an NBI medical examination reported that Weber was feigning physical weakness to justify his absence [2, 3]. The trial court ordered Weber to submit to confinement at the National Mental Hospital for observation, but he failed to comply and did not appear for the rescheduled arraignment on February 27, 1960 [4, 5].

The trial court declared the bond forfeited and granted the bondsman a period to produce the accused, which was extended until May 28, 1960 [5, 6]. The bondsman failed to produce Weber within this period [6]. Consequently, the trial court ordered the execution of the full amount of the bond [6]. The bondsman filed a motion for partial execution, requesting its liability be reduced to 10% due to the accused's alleged illness, but failed to present expert testimony or a medical certificate to substantiate the claim [6, 7]. The trial court denied the motion, ruling there was no justification for reduction [7, 8]. Fieldmen's Insurance appealed [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the bondsman is entitled to a mitigation of its liability on the forfeited bond.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the bondsman is entitled to mitigation, but not to the extent requested. Generally, the failure of a bondsman to take steps to protect its interest or show good faith in complying with court orders to produce the accused justifies the forfeiture of the bond [7, 9]. In this case, the bondsman did not exert sufficient effort to prove the accused was actually sick or to surrender him [7].

However, the Court found upon examination of the records that the accused Weber was subsequently arraigned and tried, meaning no permanent injury to public interest was caused by the default [10]. Citing *People v. Bustamante* (G.R. No. L-13665), the Court applied the principle that a bondsman is entitled to a mitigation of liability if the accused is subsequently brought to court [10]. The Court rejected the request for a reduction to 10% as "irrisory" and contrary to public policy, as it would encourage delays [10]. The liability was instead reduced to P1,000.00 [10, 11].

The order appealed from is MODIFIED, and the forfeiture is reduced to P1,000.00 [11].
