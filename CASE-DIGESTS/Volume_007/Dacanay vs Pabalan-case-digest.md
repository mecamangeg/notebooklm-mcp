I. CAPTION
APOLONIO DACANAY and PACIENCIA LOPEZ v. HON. JAVIER PABALAN, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, and ALFREDO FLORA, ERNESTO FLORA, FAUSTO FLORA, and EDUARDO ANCHETA, G.R. No. L-18263, April 23, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Dacanay and Lopez filed a case for forcible entry and detainer (Civil Case No. 278) against respondents Flora, et al. in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Umingan, Pangasinan. The JP Court ruled in favor of petitioners. Respondents filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied. Consequently, the JP Court issued a writ of execution, ruling that the decision had become final as the respondents' motion was *pro forma* and the period to appeal had lapsed.

Respondents subsequently filed a petition for *certiorari/mandamus* (Civil Case No. T-708) with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan, presided by respondent Judge Pabalan. Despite acknowledging that respondents had "lost their right to file an appeal," Judge Pabalan issued orders admitting the *certiorari* proceedings to be "treated, for all purposes, as an appeal" to allow a review of the case. Petitioners filed the instant action for *certiorari* and prohibition to restrain the CFI Judge.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CFI Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in treating a petition for *certiorari* as an appeal despite the failure to perfect an appeal in accordance with the Rules of Court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the respondent Judge exceeded his jurisdiction. Under **Section 2, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court** (now Section 2, Rule 40 of the 1997 Rules), an appeal from a decision of an inferior court must be perfected within 15 days by: (a) filing a notice of appeal with the inferior court; (b) paying the appellate docket fee; and (c) giving a bond.

The Court found that respondents failed to comply with these requirements. Specifically, they did not file a notice of appeal with the JP Court nor post the requisite appeal bond. The mere filing of a petition for *certiorari* in the CFI cannot substitute for the mandatory requirements of perfecting an appeal. Since the requirements were not met, the appeal was not perfected, and the decision of the JP Court had become final and executory.

The petition was granted. The orders of the respondent Judge dated January 24 and February 27, 1961 were set aside and annulled, and the decision of the Justice of the Peace Court was declared final and executory.
