I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PACITA MADRIGAL-GONZALES, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-16688-90, April 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Pacita Madrigal-Gonzales (Social Welfare Administration Administrator) and seven co-accused were charged with Malversation of Public Funds and 27 separate counts of Falsification of Public Documents in the Court of First Instance of Manila. The falsifications, committed between December 1954 and September 1955, allegedly involved making it appear that cash aids were distributed and relief supplies purchased when none were, to conceal the malversation. The cases were distributed to different court branches. The accused filed a Motion to Quash in Branch XVIII (handling three of the falsification cases) on the ground of double jeopardy, arguing that the 27 falsifications constituted a single "continuing offense" proceeding from one criminal impulse to conceal the malversation. They claimed that having been arraigned in other branches, they were already in jeopardy. Branch XVIII granted the motion and dismissed the cases. The prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the 27 separate acts of falsification constitute a single continuing offense such that the dismissal or arraignment in one case bars the prosecution of the others on the ground of double jeopardy.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the dismissal was erroneous because the 27 falsifications were not a continuing offense.
The Court distinguished between "motive" and "criminal intent." Motive is not an element of a felony; it is criminal intent that renders an act a felony. While the motive may have been to conceal malversation, it cannot be presumed that all acts proceeded from a single resolution without specific proof. The informations revealed that the falsifications were committed on different vouchers, dates, and for distinct amounts (e.g., Voucher Nos. 4, 6, and 13).
Citing *U.S. v. Infante & Barreto*, the Court ruled that each falsification of a separate document constitutes a distinct crime, even if committed in the course of a continuous transaction, unless they are component parts of an indivisible instrument. Similarly, in *People v. Cid* and *Regis v. People*, the Court established that multiple malversations and falsifications committed on different occasions constitute independent offenses punishable separately. Therefore, the prosecution of the remaining charges was not barred by double jeopardy.
The Order of dismissal was **SET ASIDE** and the cases were **REMANDED** for further proceedings.
