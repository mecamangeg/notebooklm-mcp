**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROMULO DE LA MERCED, G.R. No. L-19145, February 27, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 16, 1957, Romulo de la Merced, driving a De Dios bus in Quezon City, bumped the rear of a stopped Flash Taxicab, causing injuries to its passenger, Atty. Eliseo Tenza [1, 2]. De la Merced and Jose Almorin were charged with serious physical injuries through reckless imprudence in the Municipal Court [3]. Almorin pleaded guilty and was sentenced accordingly [3]. De la Merced pleaded not guilty, was convicted, and appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) [3].

In the CFI trial *de novo*, De la Merced relied solely on Almorin’s conviction in the lower court, arguing that Almorin's plea of guilt exempted him (De la Merced) from liability [2, 4]. The CFI rejected this, found De la Merced guilty based on evidence that he hit the stopped taxi, and sentenced him to 2 months and 1 day of *arresto mayor* [3, 4]. De la Merced appealed to the Court of Appeals, which forwarded the case to the Supreme Court on questions of law [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the plea of guilt by a co-accused operates to exempt the other accused from criminal liability.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court ruled that the conviction of one driver upon a plea of guilt does not preclude the conviction of the other if there is sufficient evidence that the latter was also negligent [5]. The trial in the CFI was *de novo* and independent of the proceedings in the municipal court [6]. The evidence clearly showed De la Merced was at fault for bumping a fully stopped vehicle [4]. To hold otherwise would place the automatic exemption of a co-accused in the hands of the one who chooses to plead guilty, which cannot be allowed [5, 6].

The decision of the Court of First Instance is **AFFIRMED** [6].
