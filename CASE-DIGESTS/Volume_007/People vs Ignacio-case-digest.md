I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ESTANISLAO IGNACIO Y MARCELO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18332, April 30, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Genoveva Alano and others filed a civil case for partition against Estanislao Ignacio and his co-defendants, claiming co-ownership of a parcel of land in Parañaque. While this civil case was pending, Ignacio et al. filed an application for registration of several parcels of land, including the disputed property, under Act No. 496. In their application, they swore under oath that they did not know of any mortgage or encumbrance affecting the land, or that "any other person has any interest therein, legal or equitable."

Consequently, an information for perjury was filed against Ignacio et al., alleging they willfully stated a falsehood by concealing the pending civil claim. The accused moved to quash the information on the ground that the facts charged did not constitute an offense. The Court of First Instance of Manila granted the motion and dismissed the case. The Government appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused are criminally liable for perjury for failing to disclose a pending adverse claim in their land registration application which they believed to be invalid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the facts charged do not constitute perjury. Article 183 of the Revised Penal Code requires four elements for perjury: (a) a sworn statement on a material matter; (b) before a competent officer; (c) willful and deliberate assertion of a falsehood; and (d) the statement is required by law.

The Court ruled that Section 21 of the Land Registration Act (Act No. 496) does not expressly require an applicant to name persons holding adverse claims. The law only requires the applicant to state claims which they believe are valid or recognized by law. Since the accused believed in good faith that the plaintiffs' claim in the pending civil case was invalid and groundless (a belief later confirmed by the dismissal of said civil case), such a claim is not a "material matter" required to be stated in the application. Furthermore, the information was fatally defective because it failed to allege that the accused *knew* that the mention of the adverse claim was a material matter necessary to be stated.

The order of the lower court dismissing the information is affirmed.
