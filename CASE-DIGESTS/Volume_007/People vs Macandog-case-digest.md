I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LUALHATI S. MACANDOG, G.R. Nos. L-18601-02, January 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On November 25, 1960, the City Fiscal’s office filed two informations against Lualhati S. Macandog in the Municipal Court of Manila for slander and slight physical injuries [1]. Macandog filed motions to quash both informations, arguing that the Municipal Court lacked jurisdiction over the slander case due to the absence of a written complaint by the offended party, and that the slight physical injuries case had prescribed [2]. The Municipal Court denied the motions for lack of merit [2]. Macandog appealed this denial to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [2]. The CFI dismissed the appeal on the ground that the order denying the motion to quash was interlocutory in nature [1]. Macandog then appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the order of the lower court denying a motion to quash is appealable. [2]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the appeal, holding that an order denying a motion to quash is merely interlocutory and, therefore, not appealable [3, 4].

The Court relied on established jurisprudence (*Collins v. Wolfe*, *People v. Aragon*) and Section 1, Rule 113 of the Rules of Court (now Rule 117), which mandates that after a motion to quash is overruled, the accused "shall immediately plead" [4]. This implies that the trial must proceed, and if a judgment of conviction is rendered, the accused may then appeal and raise the same questions sought to be reviewed in the motion to quash [4].

The Court also clarified that the appellant's reliance on *Arches v. Beldia* was misplaced. The phrase "appeal in due time" in that case refers to an appeal following a conviction after a trial on the merits, not an immediate appeal from an interlocutory order denying a motion to quash [5].

The order appealed from is affirmed [6].
