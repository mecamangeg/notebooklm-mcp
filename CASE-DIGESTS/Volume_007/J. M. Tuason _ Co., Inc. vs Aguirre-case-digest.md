I. CAPTION
J. M. TUASON & CO., INC. v. JOSE AGUIRRE, G.R. No. L-16827, January 31, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff J. M. Tuason & Co., Inc. is the registered owner of a parcel of land in Quezon City covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1267. Defendant Jose Aguirre occupied a portion of the land, claiming he purchased it in 1950 from Agustin de Torres. De Torres was a signatory to a Compromise Agreement dated March 16, 1953, between the plaintiff and the "Deudors." The defendant argued that his possession was in the concept of an owner and that he had introduced improvements worth P45,000.00. The Court of First Instance of Quezon City found that the defendant entered the property in October 1951 through force, strategy, and stealth. It rendered judgment ordering the defendant to vacate the premises, remove his improvements, and pay P90.00 per month from the date of usurpation. The defendant appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law, raising issues of ownership and prescription.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action of the registered owner to recover possession is barred by prescription or laches.
2. W/N the Compromise Agreement of 1953 grants the defendant the right to possess the land.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** An action to recover possession of registered land never prescribes. The Court relied on Section 46 of Act 496, which provides that no title to registered land in derogation to that of a registered owner shall be acquired by prescription or adverse possession [1, 2]. The Court cited *Estrella v. Register of Deeds of Rizal* and *Legarda v. Saleeby* to affirm that the plaintiff’s registered title, issued years prior, has become incontrovertible and can no longer be collaterally attacked [3].

2. **NO.** The effectivity of the Compromise Agreement is limited to the parties thereto and those mentioned in its exhibits. There was no showing that the defendant fell within the scope of said agreement [4]. Furthermore, possession is an attribute of ownership, and the Agreement did not legalize the occupation of intruders. Even for those covered by the Agreement, the right to possess must be preceded by a contract to sell with the plaintiff. Since the defendant failed to enter into such a contract, the plaintiff, as the registered owner, has the right to possess and enjoy the land to the exclusion of the defendant [5].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed.
