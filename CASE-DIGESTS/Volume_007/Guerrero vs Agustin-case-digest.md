I. CAPTION
GUERRERO vs. AGUSTIN, G.R. Number not indicated, Date not indicated, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Roman Guerrero obtained a levy in execution against a parcel of land owned by Juan V. Agustin to satisfy a judgment in a CAR case [1]. The levy was annotated on Agustin's Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) on January 5, 1957 [1]. Agustin had previously executed a mortgage on the same property in favor of Marcelino Maclang and Corazon Marcelo on August 21, 1956, but this mortgage was not annotated on the title until August 20, 1958 [1].

The property was sold at a public auction to Guerrero, and a final deed of sale was executed in his favor [2]. When the new title was issued to Guerrero, the Register of Deeds carried over the annotation of Maclang’s mortgage [2, 3]. Guerrero filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija to cancel the mortgage annotation, arguing his right was superior [3]. The lower court ruled in favor of Guerrero [4]. Maclang appealed, contending that the mortgage, having been executed prior to the levy, should be preferred despite its later registration [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a prior unregistered mortgage is superior to a subsequent but registered levy in execution on a Torrens title.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The levy in execution is superior. The Court held that the case is governed by the Land Registration Act (Act 496) because the land is registered under the Torrens system [5]. Under Section 51 of Act 496, the act of registration is the "operative act" that conveys or affects the land and serves as notice to all persons [5].

Since Guerrero's levy was registered on January 5, 1957, well ahead of the registration of the mortgage on August 20, 1958, the levy is prior and superior [5, 6]. The Court affirmed that rights acquired by a purchaser at an execution sale revert to the date of the annotation of the levy [7, 8]. The argument relying on Spanish Mortgage Law jurisprudence regarding preference of unrecorded deeds was rejected as inapplicable to registered land [4, 5].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [9].
