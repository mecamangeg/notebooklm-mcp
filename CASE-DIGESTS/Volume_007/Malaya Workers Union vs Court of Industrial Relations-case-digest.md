I. CAPTION
MALAYA WORKERS UNION (PAFLU), RESTITUTO GUMBOC, NICODEMUS GLORIA, TRANQUILINO ABELLANO and ANITA ADVINCULA v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, BAGUMBUHAY CIGAR AND CIGARETTE FACTORY, YU TE and PIA WA, G.R. Nos. L-17880 and L-17881, April 23, 1963, Makalintal, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioners, members of the Malaya Workers Union (PAFLU), filed two cases for unfair labor practice (ULP) against their former employer, Bagumbuhay Cigar and Cigarette Factory, alleging they were dismissed for union activities [3]. On January 30, 1960, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) issued a decision dismissing the charge of ULP but ordering the respondents to re-employ one petitioner and reinstate the others without backwages [4]. Respondents filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the CIR cannot order reinstatement after finding that the dismissals did not constitute ULP [4]. On October 31, 1960, the CIR *en banc* passed a resolution deleting the order of reinstatement from the decision [4]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court questioning the deletion of the reinstatement order [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR has the power to order reinstatement in an unfair labor practice case where it made no finding that the employees had been discriminatorily dismissed. [4]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR *en banc* resolution [5]. Citing *Baguio Gold Mining Company v. Tabisola*, the Court held that the CIR's power to order reinstatement in ULP cases is expressly granted only when the court finds that the respondent engaged in unfair labor practice [6]. Where the charge is not substantiated, this authority is implicitly withheld, and the CIR must simply dismiss the complaint [6].

The Court reasoned that the CIR's authority to order reinstatement under Commonwealth Act No. 103 is confined to instances where it exercises powers of arbitration and conciliation [7]. ULP cases are distinctive proceedings prosecuted like criminal offenses, where the CIR is inhibited from exercising such arbitration powers [7]. If a ULP charge fails, the dismissed employee is not without remedy, as any breach of obligation by the employer may be redressed like an ordinary contract or obligation [5].

The decision of the Court of Industrial Relations *en banc* is AFFIRMED [5].
