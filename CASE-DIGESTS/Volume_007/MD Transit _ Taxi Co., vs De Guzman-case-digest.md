I. CAPTION
MD TRANSIT & TAXI CO., INC. and CAM TRANSPORTATION CO. v. BIENVENIDO DE GUZMAN, CECILIO CAJOLES and BERNARDITA ORACION, G.R. No. L-18810, April 23, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners are common carriers under joint management. Respondents were employees (drivers and conductress) and members of the MD-CAM Local 3 (PTGWO) union. On October 23, 1958, respondents petitioned the Department of Labor to audit the union's Mutual Aid Fund, which revealed a P22,000.00 shortage involving the Union President. On November 9, 1958, the Union expelled the respondents. Petitioners subsequently dismissed the respondents, claiming the dismissal was due to unauthorized absences and a Union letter invoking a "closed shop" clause.

The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled in favor of respondents, finding that they were dismissed on November 9, 1958—before the petitioners actually received the Union's letter demanding dismissal (which was sent November 10, 1958). The CIR held the true cause of dismissal was the respondents' complaint regarding the fund irregularities. Petitioners appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners committed unfair labor practice in dismissing the respondents.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's finding that the dismissal constituted unfair labor practice.

The evidence showed that agents of the petitioners prevented the respondents from entering the premises or working starting November 9, 1958. However, the Union's letter (Exhibit 5) demanding their dismissal pursuant to the closed-shop agreement was not written or sent until November 10, 1958. Since the dismissal occurred **before** the petitioners received the demand from the Union, the closed-shop provision could not have been the valid cause for termination.

The Court held that the Union committed unfair labor practice under Section 4(b)(2) of Republic Act No. 875 by expelling members for preferring charges against union officers. Consequently, the petitioners, by dismissing the respondents without valid cause and effectively acting in furtherance of the Union's illegal expulsion, committed unfair labor practice under Section 4(a)(5) of the same Act.

The decision of the Court of Industrial Relations is **AFFIRMED** with the modification that back wages shall be computed from November 9, 1958, the actual date of dismissal.
