I. CAPTION
GASPAR DUMLAO v. MARCELO T. DOMINGO and JOSE APOSTOL, G.R. No. L-18835, April 29, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Gaspar Dumlao filed a case against Marcelo T. Domingo (Civil Case No. 1961) and obtained a final judgment ordering Domingo to reconvey a property covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 16671 [1]. When Domingo failed to execute the deed, the Clerk of Court executed it on his behalf [1]. To register the deed of reconveyance, Dumlao petitioned the court in Cadastral Case No. 2922 to compel Domingo to surrender the owner's duplicate TCT [2]. Domingo manifested that he had delivered possession of the title to Jose Apostol to guarantee a debt [2]. Consequently, the court ordered Apostol to surrender the title [2]. Apostol objected, arguing he held the title by virtue of an obligation annotated on the back of the certificate [3]. The lower court overruled the objection and ordered the surrender, stating that Apostol's rights would be annotated on the new title [3]. Apostol appealed the order [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a third party holding an owner's duplicate certificate of title as security for a debt can be compelled to surrender it to allow the registration of a deed of reconveyance favoring another party.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that under Section 111 of the Land Registration Act, the court has the authority to order "any person withholding the duplicate to surrender the same" to allow for the entry of a new certificate resulting from proceedings that divest the title of the registered owner [5]. The Court reasoned that the surrender of the certificate does not prejudice the holder (Apostol) because, pursuant to Section 59 of the Land Registration Act, the encumbrances and entries appearing on the back of the cancelled certificate must be annotated on the new certificate of title issued to Dumlao [3, 6]. This ensures that any rights Apostol acquired prior to the reconveyance are respected and preserved [6].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [7].
