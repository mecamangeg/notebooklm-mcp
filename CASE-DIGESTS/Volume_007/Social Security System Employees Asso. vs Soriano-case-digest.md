**I. CAPTION**
SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION (PAFLU) v. THE HON. JUDGE E. SORIANO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18081, April 30, 1963.

**II. FACTS**
The Social Security System Employees Association (PAFLU), a labor union, demanded collective bargaining with the Social Security Commission (SSC). When the SSC refused, the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Court of Industrial Relations and staged a strike and picket on February 16, 1961. On the same day, the SSC filed a petition for injunction with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. Respondent Judge E. Soriano issued an *ex parte* preliminary injunction ordering the Union to return to work and desist from picketing. The Union filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, arguing that the CFI lacked jurisdiction to issue the injunction because the Social Security System (SSS) exercises proprietary functions, making it subject to labor laws that prohibit such injunctions in labor disputes.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Social Security System (SSS) exercises proprietary functions, thereby subjecting it to labor laws and the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations rather than the CFI.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the SSS constitutes a government-owned or controlled corporation exercising proprietary functions.

The Court distinguished between the two functions of government: **constituent** (compulsory attributes of sovereignty, e.g., defense, justice) and **ministrant** (optional functions to advance general welfare, e.g., public works, trade regulations) [1, 2]. The SSS performs ministrant functions because social security is not essential to the state's existence and can be undertaken by private entities [3, 4].

Applying the doctrine in *Bacani v. National Coconut Corporation*, the Court noted that the SSS is not a municipal corporation but an entity with a separate legal personality, created to promote the economic life of the people [5, 6]. The SSS charter is patterned after the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), which the Court previously declared as exercising proprietary functions [7, 8]. Its primary activities—insurance and investment—are essentially proprietary in nature [9]. Consequently, SSS employees have the right to organize and strike, and the labor dispute falls under the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations.

The petition was **GRANTED**. The writ of preliminary injunction issued *ex parte* by the respondent judge was set aside.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Bengzon, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Regala, and Makalintal concurred. Justices Padilla, Reyes (J.B.L.), and Dizon took no part [10].
