I. CAPTION
JOSEFINA ROYONG v. ATTY. ARISTON OBLENA, Adm. Case No. 376, April 30, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On January 14, 1959, Josefina Royong filed a complaint charging Atty. Ariston Oblena with rape [1]. The Solicitor General investigated and found that while the sexual intercourse was consensual, the respondent was guilty of other misconduct [2, 3]. Respondent admitted to having illicit relations with the complainant, the niece of his common-law wife, from 1957 to 1958 [4]. Furthermore, he admitted to openly cohabiting with Briccia Angeles, the complainant’s aunt, since 1942, despite knowing she was married to another man [5, 6]. Respondent also applied for the Bar in 1954, falsely representing himself as a person of "good moral character" despite this subsisting adulterous relationship [5]. Respondent argued that fornication is not a ground for disbarment under the Rules of Court and that the Solicitor General exceeded his authority by charging offenses different from the original rape complaint [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Solicitor General is authorized to file charges different from those in the original complaint.
2. W/N the respondent should be disbarred for conduct unrelated to his professional duties (gross immorality).

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that nothing in the Rules of Court limits the Solicitor General to the offense charged in the original complaint. Under the rules (Sections 4 and 5 of Rule 128, now Rule 139), if the Solicitor General finds sufficient grounds to proceed based on the evidence adduced during the investigation, he is at liberty to file the corresponding complaint for any case justified by such evidence [8, 9].

2. **YES.** The enumeration of grounds for disbarment in the Rules of Court is not exclusive. The power to exclude unfit members of the bar is inherent in the courts and may be exercised without special statutory authority [7, 10]. The standard of "good moral character" is a continuing requirement for the practice of law, not just a prerequisite for admission [11]. Respondent’s conduct—adulterous relations with a married woman and the simultaneous seduction of her niece—shows moral depravity and renders him unfit for the privileges of the legal profession [12, 13]. Furthermore, his falsification of his moral character in his 1954 bar application is a ground for removal, as moral character is an objective reality, not a subjective opinion [14].

Judgment is hereby entered striking the name of herein respondent, Ariston J. Oblena, from the roll of attorneys.
