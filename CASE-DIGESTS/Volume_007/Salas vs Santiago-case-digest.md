I. CAPTION
PIERRE L. SALAS v. CIRIO H. SANTIAGO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17090, March 30, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Pierre L. Salas filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga, alleging he was the author of the story "Ifugao," which was serialized in "Hiwaga Komiks" and radio. He claimed the defendants adapted it into a motion picture without his consent. Salas prayed for P100,000.00 in damages and attorney's fees [1]. Defendant Cirio H. Santiago claimed authorship and filed a counterclaim for P12,000.00, while other defendants filed smaller counterclaims [2]. The trial court ruled in favor of Salas, awarding him P1,500.00 compensatory damages, P5,000.00 moral and exemplary damages, and P3,000.00 attorney's fees [3]. Defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals, while Salas appealed to the Supreme Court; the lower court forwarded all records to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court found that it lacked jurisdiction because the amounts claimed by both appellants, either individually or collectively, did not reach the amount of P200,000.00. Furthermore, the assignments of error raised by both parties involved questions of both law and fact [4]. Under the applicable law at the time, appeals involving amounts less than P200,000.00 and mixed questions of fact and law fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.

Consequently, the Court resolved to certify the case to the Court of Appeals for adjudication [4].
