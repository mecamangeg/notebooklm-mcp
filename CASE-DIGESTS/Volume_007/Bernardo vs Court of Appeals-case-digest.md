I. CAPTION
DEOGRACIAS BERNARDO, executor of the testate estate of the deceased EUSEBIO CAPILI, et al. v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS and THE HEIRS OF THE LATE HERMOGENA REYES, G.R. No. L-18148, February 28, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Eusebio Capili died testate, disposing of his properties to his widow, Hermogena Reyes, and his cousins (Petitioners). His will was admitted to probate. Subsequently, Hermogena died and was substituted by her collateral relatives (Respondents). The executor filed a project of partition allocating the properties to Eusebio's testamentary heirs, claiming the properties belonged exclusively to Eusebio because Hermogena had donated her share of the conjugal partnership to him. Respondents opposed, claiming the donation was void and 1/2 of the properties belonged to the conjugal partnership. The Probate Court declared the donation void (violating Art. 133 prohibition on donations between spouses or lacking testamentary formalities) and disapproved the partition. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Petitioners appealed, arguing the probate court had no jurisdiction to determine questions of title to property.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the probate court had jurisdiction to determine the validity of the deed of donation and the question of ownership over the disputed properties.

IV. RULING
**YES.** While the general rule is that questions of title cannot be passed upon in testate or intestate proceedings, an exception arises when the interested parties are all heirs of the deceased and they submit the question to the probate court without prejudice to third parties [1]. In such cases, the probate court may definitely pass judgment thereon [1].

Here, the controversy regarding whether the properties were conjugal or exclusive is within the probate court's jurisdiction because it must liquidate the conjugal partnership to determine the decedent's estate [2, 3]. The parties are all heirs (testamentary heirs and the widow's compulsory heirs represented by her successors), and no third party rights are affected [4]. Furthermore, by presenting a project of partition relying on the donation, Petitioners effectively submitted the issue of ownership to the court and are estopped from withdrawing it upon receiving an adverse ruling (*Cunanan v. Amparo*; *Mañalac v. Ocampo*) [5]. The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
