**I. CAPTION**
CLEMENTE SUMCAD v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and PHILIPPINE MARINE OFFICERS GUILD, G.R. No. L-18716, April 29, 1963, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Clemente Sumcad was the master of a vessel employed by William Lines, Inc. (Company). In 1957, the Company and the Philippine Marine Officers Guild (Union) entered into a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) containing a closed-shop clause, which required union membership as a condition of employment [1, 2]. Sumcad, who was already employed by the Company prior to the CBA, refused to join the Union [2, 3]. Upon the Union's demand, the Company notified Sumcad to affiliate within 24 hours or face dismissal [2]. After Sumcad’s attempts to secure an injunction from regular courts failed, the Company dismissed him [4].

Sumcad filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) against the Company and the Union in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [4]. During the pendency of the case, Sumcad and the Company reached an amicable settlement, leading the CIR to dismiss the charges against the Company [4]. However, the CIR also granted the Union's motion to dismiss, ruling that the Union committed no unfair labor practice [4]. Sumcad appealed this dismissal to the Supreme Court [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Union committed an unfair labor practice by coercing the petitioner to join the organization and causing his dismissal.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal order. Under Section 3 of the Industrial Peace Act, employees have the right to join any labor organization of their own choice [3, 6]. Section 4 of the same Act makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to "coerce employees in the exercise of their rights under section three" [3, 6].

The Court reasoned that the Union could be found guilty of ULP regardless of whether Sumcad was covered by the CBA [3]. If Sumcad was covered, the Union's action was illegal because, as an employee already in the service of the Company when the closed-shop agreement was signed, he was not under obligation to join the Union to keep his job [3, 6, 7]. If he was not covered, the Union still "coerced" him to join and caused his dismissal for refusing to do so [7].

The orders appealed from were **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the respondent court for further appropriate proceedings [7].
