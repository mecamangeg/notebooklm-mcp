I. CAPTION
FEDERICA ABALLE, et al. v. FORTUNATO SANTIAGO, G.R. No. L-16307, April 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Federica Aballe filed an action for support, successional rights, and moral damages against Fortunato Santiago on behalf of herself and her two minor sons [1]. She claimed she lived with Santiago as his wife starting in 1947 and that he fathered her children, presenting baptismal certificates and unsigned notes as evidence [1, 2]. In his Answer, Santiago stated he had no knowledge sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the averments and specifically denied the causes of action; he further denied the paternity and documents during trial [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, ruling that Aballe failed to prove her claims as the baptismal certificates were not authentic documents of filiation and the notes were unauthenticated [4, 5]. Aballe appealed directly to the Supreme Court, arguing that Santiago failed to deny her material evidence, and thus, it should be deemed impliedly admitted [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendant is deemed to have impliedly admitted the plaintiffs' evidence by failing to deny it.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The rule that material evidence is deemed impliedly admitted if not denied does not apply where the defendant specifically denies the averments. The Court held that the defendant effectively denied the allegations by stating in his Answer that he lacked knowledge sufficient to form a belief as to their truth and by denying all statements and documentary evidence during the trial [3, 7]. Furthermore, by appealing directly to the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs waived all factual issues and submitted the case on questions of law only [1, 5]. Consequently, the Supreme Court was bound by the lower court's factual finding that the evidence presented (baptismal certificates and unsigned notes) was insufficient to prove filiation or justify the claims [5]. The decision appealed from is affirmed [8].
