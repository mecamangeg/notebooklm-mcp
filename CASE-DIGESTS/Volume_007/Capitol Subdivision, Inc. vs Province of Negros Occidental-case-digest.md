I. CAPTION
CAPITOL SUBDIVISION, INC. v. PROVINCE OF NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, G.R. No. L-16257, January 31, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Lot 378, part of Hacienda Mandalagan, was originally registered to the Amenabars and sold to Jose Benares in 1920. Benares mortgaged the property to Bacolod-Murcia Milling in 1921 and to the Philippine National Bank (PNB) in 1926. PNB foreclosed the mortgage and acquired the title in 1934 [1-3]. PNB later sold the property to Carlos Benares, who transferred his rights to the petitioner, Capitol Subdivision, Inc. The petitioner finished paying the installments and secured a Transfer Certificate of Title in 1949 [3]. Upon attempting to take possession, the petitioner discovered that the Provincial Hospital, constructed by the respondent Province of Negros Occidental in 1926, occupied the lot [4]. The petitioner filed a suit for recovery of possession and compensation. The respondent claimed it had acquired the lot via expropriation proceedings in 1924-1925 and had occupied it openly since, attributing the lack of title transfer to an error [5, 6]. The Court of First Instance, after a remand, ruled in favor of the respondent, holding that the lot had been expropriated [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent Province acquired Lot 378 through the alleged expropriation proceedings.
2. W/N the petitioner is a purchaser in good faith entitled to compensation for the lot.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court found no evidence that the expropriation of Lot 378 was ever consummated. Unlike other lots where deeds of sale were registered and titles transferred to the Province, no such documents existed for Lot 378 [8]. Furthermore, the lot was under a registered mortgage to Bacolod-Murcia Milling during the alleged expropriation, yet the mortgagee was not impleaded in the proceedings [9]. The Court found the testimony regarding an oral compromise agreement incredible and contradicted by documentary evidence [10, 11].

2. **YES.** The petitioner is a purchaser in good faith and for value. The Court held that the main purpose of the Torrens System is to avoid conflicts of title and allow the public to rely on the face of the certificate of title without need for further inquiry, unless they have actual knowledge of defects (*Tiburcio v. PHHC*) [12, 13]. The petitioner did not know the hospital sat on Lot 378 until 1949 and was justified in assuming PNB had a clean title [13]. Since the Province’s right to expropriate is uncontested, the petitioner is entitled to recover the fair and full value of the lot as of the time of actual taking by the Province, plus consequential damages and interest [14, 15].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the records **REMANDED** to the lower court for the determination of compensation.
