**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RUPERTO SORIA, G.R. No. L-18982, January 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Ruperto Soria owned a house in Pagadian, Zamboanga del Sur. In June 1958, he started repairs on the house without the permit required by Municipal Ordinance No. 119, series of 1949 [1]. Soria had attempted to secure a permit but abandoned the process after being bounced between the mayor's office, the local health officer, and the assistant engineer [2]. The Justice of the Peace Court found him guilty of violating the ordinance. On appeal, the Court of First Instance sentenced him to pay a fine of P50.00 and ordered the removal of his *entire house* at his expense within 30 days [3]. Soria appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved purely questions of law [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Municipal Council has the authority to enact an ordinance requiring building permits and imposing penalties.
2. W/N the court may validly order the removal of an illegal construction.
3. W/N the order to remove the appellant's entire house was proper.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Municipal Council has the authority to prescribe the kind of buildings that may be constructed or repaired under Section 2243(c) of the Revised Administrative Code [4, 5]. To exercise this power, Section 2239 of the same Code expressly grants the council authority to impose fines (up to P200.00) or imprisonment (up to six months). Therefore, the ordinance is valid and not *ultra vires* [5].

2. **YES.** The power to require the removal of illegal constructions is justified under the general welfare clause, which allows the council to provide for the health and safety of the municipality [6, 7]. The Court ruled that such removal is not a penalty in the technical sense, but a "coercive measure" to prevent violators from making a mockery of the ordinance or profiting from illegal acts [6].

3. **NO.** The directive to remove the entire house was deemed "too severe" [7]. Soria was prosecuted for undertaking *repairs* without a permit, not for the illegal construction of the house itself. The Court held it sufficient to order the removal of only the illegal repairs made [7, 8].

**Disposition:** The decision is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the accused shall remove only the illegal repairs, not the house itself [9].
