**I. CAPTION**
NATIONAL MERCHANDISING CORPORATION v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, GOODWILL LABOR ORGANIZATION-CCLU and NAMERCO EMPLOYEES and LABOR ASSOCIATION (FTLO), G.R. No. L-18710, March 30, 1963, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
National Merchandising Corporation (Petitioner) contested an order of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) regarding a certification election sought by the Goodwill Labor Organization (Respondent). While the parties agreed to the election, the Petitioner insisted that 8 specific employees—designated as section chiefs (Chief Mechanics, Chief Welder, Chief Painter, and Chief Carpenter)—should be excluded from the bargaining unit because they were "supervisors" [1, 2]. The CIR ruled that these employees were merely minor supervisory employees who worked closely with their subordinates and included them in the rank-and-file unit [3]. Evidence showed these employees had no clear appointments as supervisors, had never exercised their alleged power to recommend hiring or firing, and were directly supervised by a Service Manager who assigned work to all personnel [4, 5]. One alleged supervisor even received a lower salary than a mechanic under him [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the 8 section chiefs are supervisors under Section 2(k) of Republic Act 875 and should be excluded from the bargaining unit.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's order. Under Section 2(k) of Republic Act 875, a "supervisor" must have the authority to hire, transfer, suspend, or discipline employees, or to *effectively recommend* such acts using *independent judgment* [7]. The Court held that the power to recommend must be effective and not merely routinary or clerical [8, 9].

In this case, the Court found that the employees' authority was not effective because: (1) there were no clear appointments granting them such power; (2) they never actually exercised the power to recommend; (3) any recommendation was subject to evaluation and final action by department heads; and (4) they did not "responsibly direct" others, as the Service Manager assigned all work [5, 9]. The designation of "Chief" merely indicated they were the lead worker in their category, not supervisors [5]. Consequently, they were properly included in the rank-and-file bargaining unit. The petition was denied and the CIR order affirmed [10].
