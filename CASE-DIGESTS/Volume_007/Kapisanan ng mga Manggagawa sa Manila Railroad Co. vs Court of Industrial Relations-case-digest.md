I. CAPTION
KAPISANAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA SA MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and GUILLERMO POLINGON v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and THE MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-18969, April 24, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Guillermo Polingon, an employee of respondent Manila Railroad Company and member of the petitioner Union, was suspended from employment on October 10, 1954, due to the filing of criminal charges for qualified theft against him [1]. Following his acquittal on April 16, 1959, he was reinstated to his position but was not paid backwages [1]. He filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to recover said backwages [1]. The respondent company moved to dismiss the petition on the ground of lack of jurisdiction [1]. The CIR dismissed the petition on August 25, 1961, and the CIR *en banc* subsequently denied the petitioners' motion for reconsideration [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over a claim for backwages that does not allege unfair labor practice.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that an action to recover backwages which does not charge the employer with unfair labor practice is a mere money claim [2]. Such claims do not fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations to adjudicate [2]. The orders appealed from were affirmed [3].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, Regala, and Makalintal concurred [3]. Justice Barrera took no part [3].
