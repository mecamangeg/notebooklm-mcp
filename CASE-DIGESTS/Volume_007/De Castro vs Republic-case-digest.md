I. CAPTION
REMEDIOS SAN LUIS DE CASTRO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17431, April 30, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On February 22, 1960, petitioner Remedios San Luis de Castro filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Manila to correct entries in the birth record of her daughter, Teresita. The birth record registered the child's surname as "del Rosario" (after the alleged father, Pedro Reyes del Rosario), her status as "legitimate," and indicated that the parents were married on June 27, 1957. Remedios sought to correct these entries to reflect that the child's surname is "de Castro," the father is "Unknown," the status is "illegitimate," and that no marriage took place, asserting she was single. The Local Civil Registrar and the Solicitor General opposed the petition, arguing that the alleged errors were substantial and could not be corrected through summary proceedings under Article 412 of the Civil Code. The trial court dismissed the petition, and Remedios appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N substantial errors regarding paternity, filiation, and marital status in the civil registry can be corrected via summary proceedings under Article 412 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the corrections sought by the petitioner were not merely clerical but substantial. The requested changes affected the rights, status, and paternity of the child, her filiation (whether legitimate or illegitimate), and the marital relation between the mother and the putative father. Citing *Barillo v. Republic*, the Court held that such substantial errors cannot be corrected summarily under Article 412 of the Civil Code. Consequently, the judgment of the lower court dismissing the petition was affirmed.
