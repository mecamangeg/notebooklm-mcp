I. CAPTION
AMERICAN STEAMSHIP AGENCIES, INC. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and LADISLAO DE GUIA, G.R. No. L-17878, January 31, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On September 30, 1958, respondent Ladislao de Guia filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against petitioner American Steamship Agencies, Inc. for the recovery of overtime and separation pay [1]. De Guia alleged he was employed as a head checker and supercargo from November 1952 until his illegal dismissal in April 1958 [1]. The petitioner denied the existence of an employer-employee relationship, asserting De Guia was employed by the Waterfront Employees Union, and claimed his dismissal was due to insubordination [2]. The CIR rendered a decision on July 11, 1959, ordering the petitioner to pay overtime and separation pay [3]. After the CIR en banc denied the petitioner's motion for reconsideration, the company filed this petition for review [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over the claim for overtime and separation pay.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over a claim for overtime and wrongful severance pay only if the employer-employee relationship is still existing or is sought to be re-established [4, 5]. In this case, the relationship had already been terminated, and De Guia's complaint was limited strictly to claims for overtime and separation pay without seeking reinstatement [6]. Consequently, the claim is a simple money claim that falls outside the jurisdiction of the CIR. The Court cited *Price Stabilization Corporation vs. CIR* and *New Angat-Manila Transportation vs. CIR* as basis for this doctrine [4, 5].

The decision appealed from is set aside [7].
