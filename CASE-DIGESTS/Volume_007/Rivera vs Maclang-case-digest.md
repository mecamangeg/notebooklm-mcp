**I. CAPTION**
PEDRO P. RIVERA v. CARLOS P. MACLANG, G.R. No. L-15948, January 31, 1963, Makalintal, J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
On August 19, 1949, the Municipality of Malolos conducted a bidding for road maintenance materials, which Pedro Rivera won [3]. On August 31, 1949, the contract was signed by Rivera and Carlos Maclang, the Municipal Mayor [3]. Rivera subsequently delivered gravel and adobe stones valued at P19,235.00 [3]. Despite a municipal resolution in 1951 approving the contract, Rivera was not paid [3].

Rivera initially sought payment from the municipality, but in a previous case (G.R. No. L-8847), the Supreme Court declared the contract void regarding the municipal government because no funds had been appropriated prior to its execution, violating Section 607 of the Revised Administrative Code [4, 5]. Rivera then filed the present action against Maclang in his *personal* capacity [5]. The trial court dismissed the complaint, reasoning that since the contract was declared void, it could produce no legal effect for recovery [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Mayor Maclang is personally liable for the value of the materials delivered under the contract declared void for lack of appropriation.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court reversed the trial court's dismissal. The ruling is based on Section 608 of the Revised Administrative Code, which provides that a purported contract entered into contrary to the requirements of Section 607 (requiring certification of available funds) is "wholly void," but explicitly states that "the officer assuming to make such contract shall be liable to the Government or other contracting party for any consequent damage to the same extent as if the transaction had been wholly between private parties" [6].

Maclang, as the officer who signed the contract in violation of Section 607, falls squarely under this provision [7]. His liability is personal, as if the transaction had been entered into by him as a private party [7]. The Court emphasized that the law intends to ensure public officers exercise a high degree of caution to prevent the government from becoming a victim of ill-advised or improvident actions [7].

Accordingly, Maclang was ordered to pay Rivera the sum of P19,235.00, with legal interest [8].
