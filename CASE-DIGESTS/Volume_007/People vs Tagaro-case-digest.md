I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FEDERICO TAGARO, alias FEDERICO LANUZA, G.R. No. L-18518, January 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On September 26, 1959, during a baptismal party in Naujan, Oriental Mindoro, a sudden quarrel arose between Pablo Tagaro and his father-in-law, Agapito Sarmiento [1], [2]. Pablo hacked Agapito with a bolo. The accused, Federico Tagaro (Pablo's brother), intervened, grappled with Pablo, and successfully disarmed him [2]. Armed with the bolo, Federico immediately attacked Bienvenido Sarmiento, who attempted to flee but was overtaken and hacked to death [3]. Federico then pursued Agapito, who had surrendered and knelt begging for mercy; Federico dragged him to a nearby pit and killed him [4], [5]. The Court of First Instance of Oriental Mindoro convicted Federico of Double Murder and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*, resulting in the automatic elevation of the case to the Supreme Court [6], [7], [8]. The accused claimed denial, alleging his brother Pablo was the killer [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the relationship of the witnesses to the victims undermines their credibility.
2. W/N the killing constitutes Murder qualified by evident premeditation and treachery.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the mere relationship of prosecution witnesses to the decedent is not a sufficient basis for rejecting their testimony in the absence of a motive to falsely implicate the accused [10]. Relatives of the deceased are often more interested in punishing the actual culprit than the State itself [11].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the crimes committed were **Double Homicide**, not Murder [12].
   *   **Evident Premeditation:** Absent because the killing was a sequel to a sudden quarrel that flared up between the accused's brother and the victim [13].
   *   **Treachery (*alevosia*):** Absent because the killing was immediately preceded by an altercation [14]. For *alevosia* to exist, the aggressor must have consciously adopted a mode of attack intended to facilitate the crime without risk to himself [13]. Since the altercation put the victims on guard, the appellant did not deliberately seek to kill at no risk to himself [15].
   *   **Abuse of Superior Strength:** The Court noted the killing could have been Murder qualified by abuse of superior strength, but this circumstance was not alleged in the information [15]. Thus, it serves only as an aggravating circumstance [12].

The decision is **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**. The accused is found guilty of Double Homicide aggravated by abuse of superior strength and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 12 years of *prision mayor* to 20 years of *reclusion temporal* for each offense [12], [16].
