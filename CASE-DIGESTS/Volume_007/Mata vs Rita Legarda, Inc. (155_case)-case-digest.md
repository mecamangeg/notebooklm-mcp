I. CAPTION
**GERTRUDES MATA, ET AL. v. RITA LEGARDA, INC.**, G.R. No. L-18941, January 31, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Gertrudes and Conrado Mata filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Manila to compel defendant Rita Legarda, Inc. to execute a deed of absolute sale for two lots and deliver the certificate of title [1]. The defendant answered, but after failing to appear at the initial hearing on August 8, 1957, a judgment by default was rendered for the plaintiffs [2]. The court granted defendant's motion to set aside the decision and rescheduled the hearing to February 18, 1958 [3].

When the case was called on the new date, the defendant again failed to appear, causing the lower court to reinstate the default judgment. Defendant moved for reconsideration, providing evidence that its counsel, Atty. Mariano G. Bustos, was hospitalized for surgery and did not receive notice. The notice of hearing was instead served upon Jose de la Paz, an employee of the defendant corporation, at its office [3, 4]. The lower court maintained its decision, leading to this appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N service of notice of hearing upon the party (defendant's employee) instead of the attorney of record is valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that under Section 2, Rule 27 of the Rules of Court, once a party appears by attorney, service of pleadings and notices must be made upon the attorney, not the party, unless service upon the party is explicitly ordered by the court [5, 6].

The Court applied the doctrine that notice to the party himself, when represented by counsel, is "not notice in law" [6]. The Court cited *Martinez v. Martinez* to clarify that the general term "parties" in Rule 31 does not exclude the application of Rule 27 regarding service to attorneys [7]. Since the notice was not served on the attorney of record, the proceedings taken during the hearing did not bind the client [8].

**WHEREFORE**, the orders appealed from are set aside and the case is remanded to the court below for further proceedings [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred [8].
