I. CAPTION
LA PAZ Y BUEN VIAJE (LA DICHA CIGAR and CIGARETTES FACTORY) v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-17830, March 30, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
From September 1949 to September 1950, petitioner La Paz y Buen Viaje, a domestic cigarette manufacturer, produced and sold "largos" (king size) cigarettes at a uniform wholesale price of P7.60 per thousand [1]. Petitioner paid a specific tax of P4.00 per thousand on these goods [1]. Respondent Collector of Internal Revenue subsequently assessed a deficiency tax, contending that the applicable rate was P6.00 per thousand, resulting in a total deficiency of P12,066.00 [2].

Petitioner paid the deficiency and filed a claim for refund, arguing that under Section 137 of the Tax Code, if the assessed tax of P6.00 were deducted from the P7.60 gross price, the net price would be P1.60, which falls under the proviso imposing only a P4.00 tax [3]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) dismissed the refund claim, ruling that the P4.00 originally paid tax should be deducted from the gross price to determine the classification, resulting in a net price of P3.60, which warrants the P6.00 tax rate [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the applicable specific tax rate on the cigarettes is P6.00 per thousand.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's computation. Under Section 19(a) of Regulations No. 27 of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the basis for determining the specific tax rate is the manufacturer's sworn statement showing the price charged "without adding the internal revenue tax" [5].

To determine the correct tax bracket under Section 137(b) of the Tax Code, the specific tax originally paid (P4.00) must be deducted from the manufacturer's wholesale price (P7.60) [4, 6]. This results in a net wholesale price of P3.60 per thousand [4]. Since this net price is more than P3.50 but not more than P4.50, it falls under subdivision (2), paragraph (b) of Section 137, which imposes a specific tax of P6.00 per thousand [4, 7, 8]. Petitioner's method of deducting the higher assessed tax to lower the net price was rejected.

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED [8].
