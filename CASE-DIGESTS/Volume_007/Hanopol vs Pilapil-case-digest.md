I. CAPTION
ILUMINADO HANOPOL v. PERFECTO PILAPIL, G.R. No. L-19248, February 28, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Hanopol claims ownership of a parcel of unregistered land based on private instruments of sale executed in his favor by the Siapos in 1938 [1]. In 1948, Hanopol filed a reivindicatory case (Civil Case No. 412) against the vendors, alleging they had forcibly taken possession in 1945; he secured a favorable judgment in 1958 declaring him the owner [1].

However, Respondent Pilapil asserts title based on a notarized deed of sale executed by the same vendors on December 3, 1945, which he registered under Act No. 3344 on August 20, 1948 [2]. The Court of First Instance of Leyte (Civil Case No. 21) ruled in favor of Pilapil in this action for double sale [3]. Hanopol appealed, arguing that the judgment against the vendors in Civil Case No. 412 should bind Pilapil and that his prior purchase constitutes a "better right" under Act No. 3344 [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the judgment in Civil Case No. 412 against the vendors is binding on Pilapil.
2. W/N Hanopol’s prior private sale constitutes a "better right" under Act No. 3344 that prejudices Pilapil’s subsequent registered sale.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Pilapil is not bound by the judgment because he is not a successor-in-interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action. Under Rule 39, Section 44(b) of the Rules of Court, a judgment is conclusive only between the parties and their successors in interest by title acquired *after* the commencement of the action [6]. Pilapil acquired the land on December 3, 1945, long before Hanopol filed the complaint against the vendors in 1948 [7].

2. **NO.** The "better right" referred to in Act No. 3344 requires more than just a prior deed of sale; it involves additional facts such as prescriptive rights or possession [8, 9]. The Court applied Article 1544 of the Civil Code (formerly Article 1473) regarding double sales, noting that preference is given to the one who first takes possession in good faith if the land is unregistered [10, 11]. Hanopol admitted the vendors were in possession when they sold the land to Pilapil in 1945, transmitting possession to Pilapil [9, 11]. Since Pilapil had a notarized deed, registration, and possession (constructive or actual) without bad faith, his right is superior to Hanopol’s mere prior private deed [11].

Petition denied; decision affirmed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
J.B.L. Reyes, J., concurred but reserved his vote regarding the Court's interpretation of the effect of registration under Act No. 3344 [12].
