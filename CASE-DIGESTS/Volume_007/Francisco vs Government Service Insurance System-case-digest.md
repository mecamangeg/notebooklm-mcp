I. CAPTION
TRINIDAD J. FRANCISCO v. GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM, G.R. Nos. L-18287 and L-18155, March 30, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Trinidad Francisco mortgaged her property (Vic-Mari Compound) to defendant GSIS to secure a loan [1]. GSIS extrajudicially foreclosed on the property due to arrears [2]. Plaintiff's father, Atty. Vicente Francisco, sent a letter to GSIS General Manager Andal offering to redeem the property by paying P30,000.00 down and the balance through monthly installments administered by GSIS [3]. On the same day, Atty. Francisco received a telegram from Andal stating: "GSIS BOARD APPROVED YOUR REQUEST RE REDEMPTION OF FORECLOSED PROPERTY OF YOUR DAUGHTER" [4]. Relying on this, plaintiff remitted payments which GSIS accepted [5]. Later, GSIS claimed the telegram was erroneous as the Board Resolution actually conditioned acceptance on plaintiff paying all foreclosure expenses, and subsequently consolidated the title [6, 7]. The trial court ruled the contract binding and annulled the consolidation [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the telegram sent by the GSIS General Manager is binding on the corporation despite the alleged error regarding the Board's actual resolution.
2. W/N the plaintiff is entitled to moral/exemplary damages and attorney's fees.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A corporation cannot evade the binding effect of a telegram sent by its officer, nor can the addressee be blamed for relying on it [8]. Even if the officer exceeded authority or made a mistake, the corporation is estopped from denying apparent authority to innocent third persons [9]. "If a private corporation intentionally or negligently clothes its officers or agents with apparent power to perform acts for it, the corporation will be estopped to deny that such apparent authority is real" (citing *2 Fletcher’s Encyclopedia, Priv. Corp. 255*) [10]. Furthermore, GSIS's silence and unconditional acceptance of subsequent remittances constituted a binding ratification of the agreement under Article 1393 of the Civil Code [11, 12].

2. **NO.** Moral damages are not warranted as the breach was not malicious or fraudulent (citing *Article 2220, Civil Code*) [13]. Exemplary damages require other forms of damages to be awarded first (*Article 2234, Civil Code*) [14]. Attorney's fees were correctly denied due to the absence of gross and evident bad faith [14].

The appealed decision is **AFFIRMED** [15].
