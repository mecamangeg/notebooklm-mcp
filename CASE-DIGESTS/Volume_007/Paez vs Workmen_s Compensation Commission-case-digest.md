I. CAPTION
CONRADO PAEZ v. THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and ISABELA JAPONES, G.R. No. L-18438, March 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Paez was engaged in the business of buying and selling palay, employing agents and truck drivers paid on a commission basis. In transporting palay from Isabela to Nueva Ecija or Tarlac, he utilized motor vehicles and ferried the goods via bancas across the Magat River. On August 2, 1953, Marciano Barawid, a substitute driver for Paez, crossed the river to assist another driver in loading palay to hasten their return. Despite being advised not to board a fully loaded banca, Barawid did so. The banca capsized, and he drowned.

The hearing officer initially dismissed the claim filed by Barawid’s heirs for lack of jurisdiction, arguing Paez’s capital was less than P10,000 and the business was not hazardous. The Associate Commissioner reversed this, ruling the business was hazardous due to the use of trucks. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) ordered Paez to pay death benefits, burial expenses, and attorney's fees. Paez appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the WCC has jurisdiction over the case (specifically, W/N the business is hazardous).
2. W/N the death arose out of and in the course of employment.
3. W/N the claim is barred by prescription due to late filing.
4. W/N the deceased was guilty of notorious negligence.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The WCC has jurisdiction. Under Section 42 of Act No. 3428 (Workmen’s Compensation Act), enterprises involving the "transportation of persons or goods" are considered hazardous [1]. While buying and selling palay is not inherently hazardous, the regular use of motor vehicles was indispensable to Paez's business, thereby categorizing it as a hazardous enterprise [2]. Furthermore, Paez charged freight for transporting palay for others, effectively engaging in the transportation business [3].

2. **YES.** The death arose out of and in the course of employment. Barawid’s act of crossing the river to help a co-employee load palay was intended to advance the employer's interest by speeding up the work [4]. Acts outside an employee's regular duties undertaken in good faith to benefit the employer are within the course of employment [5].

3. **NO.** The action is not barred. Although the notice of injury was filed beyond the statutory 3-month period, Paez had knowledge of the accident and made voluntary payments to the widow (P150 for burial and P150 for subsistence) [6]. Under Sections 24 and 27 of Act No. 3428, employer knowledge or voluntary compensation payments render the delay in filing the claim immaterial [6].

4. **NO.** The deceased was not guilty of notorious negligence. Notorious negligence signifies a deliberate act to disregard one's safety [7]. Barawid’s decision to board the loaded banca despite a warning was a "miscalculation" of the danger rather than a deliberate intent to end his life or wantonly court death [7, 8]. Simple disobedience to a warning does not constitute notorious negligence [8].

**WHEREFORE**, the petition is dismissed, and the decision appealed from is affirmed.
