I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FRANCISCO AGUILAR, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20147, February 28, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Appellant Jose Ramirez's counsel, Atty. Nicolas A. Superable, failed to file the appellant's brief by the deadline of November 28, 1962 [1]. The Supreme Court issued a resolution on January 8, 1963, requiring Atty. Superable to explain why disciplinary action should not be taken against him for this failure [1]. On January 28, 1963, Atty. Superable filed an unverified explanation claiming that: (1) he had not received notice to file the brief; (2) his appearance in the lower court was only for fixing the bail bond; and (3) the appellant's brother had informed him that the appeal would be discontinued [1, 2]. However, Court records showed that notice was sent on October 29, 1962, and received on behalf of the counsel [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an attorney's explanation for failure to file a brief regarding a potential disciplinary action must be under oath.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that facts stated in an explanation regarding a failure to file a brief must be supported by oath [2]. Because Atty. Superable's explanation was unverified and contradicted by the registry return card showing receipt of notice, it was insufficient [2]. The Court ordered Atty. Nicolas A. Superable to file another verified explanation within ten (10) days from notice [2].
