I. CAPTION
HEIRS OF BASILISA JUSTIVA v. GUSTILO, G.R. No. L-16396, January 31, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In December 1952, petitioners Heirs of Basilisa Justiva filed a complaint against respondents Spouses Jesus and Purificacion Gustilo to annul two deeds of sale executed by Isidra Justiva in favor of the spouses. The complaint alleged that Isidra signed the deeds due to insidious words and machinations [1, 2].

The complaint was amended multiple times. In September 1954, petitioners changed their theory, alleging the transfer was fraudulent and done without Isidra's knowledge by taking advantage of her credulity. In June 1955, they amended it again to allege that Isidra's signatures were forgeries [2]. It was also noted that a prior complaint filed in October 1952, which alleged inadequate consideration, had been dismissed [3].

The trial court dismissed the complaint and ordered petitioners to pay respondents P2,000.00 for moral damages, P1,000.00 for actual damages, and P2,000.00 for attorney’s fees, finding the petitioners' actuations insincere and baseless [4, 5]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision *in toto* [4]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning only the award of damages and attorney’s fees, not the dismissal of their complaint [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the award of attorney’s fees, moral damages, and actual damages against the petitioners is proper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals.

**Attorney's Fees:** While attorney’s fees are generally not a proper element of damages, the law allows exceptions in cases of a "clearly unfounded civil action" or where the Court deems it "just and equitable" [5, 6]. The lower courts expressly found petitioners' actuations to be insincere and baseless, evidenced by their shifting theories from inadequate consideration to fraud, and finally to forgery [3, 5].

**Moral Damages:** The award is sustained due to the patent insincerity of the petitioners. Furthermore, the allegation of forgery is considered "all but a defamation" which, under Article 2219(7) of the Civil Code, serves as a ground for moral damages due to the wounded feelings and besmirched reputation of the defendants [5, 7].

**Actual Damages:** Although the respondents did not specifically pray for "actual damages" in their Answer, their prayer for "such further relief... as this Honorable Court may deem just and equitable" was sufficient [7]. The respondents introduced evidence of actual damages during the trial, and petitioners failed to object to such presentation. Consequently, unalleged but proved matters of actual damages may be considered by the court [8].

The petition was **DENIED**, and the decision under review was **AFFIRMED** with costs [9].
