I. CAPTION
MANUEL R. SOLIVIO v. HON. FRANCISCO ARELLANO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, and THE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL OF CADIZ, Negros Occidental, G.R. No. L-15876, April 30, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Manuel R. Solivio, the Chief of Police of Cadiz, was ordered reinstated by the Supreme Court in a previous decision (G.R. No. L-10535). Pursuant to this, respondent Judge Arellano issued an order on July 6, 1957, directing the Mayor to reinstate Solivio [1, 2]. The Mayor complied, and Solivio assumed office on July 9, 1957 [2]. However, the next day, July 10, the Mayor filed new administrative charges against Solivio under R.A. No. 557 and suspended him [2].

Solivio moved to lift the suspension, and on July 20, 1957, Judge Arellano ordered his reinstatement "without prejudice to the continuation of the administrative charges" [2, 3]. The Mayor challenged this in the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-12590) and obtained a preliminary injunction; meanwhile, the Municipal Council investigated Solivio, found him guilty, and dismissed him on December 7, 1957, a decision affirmed by the Commissioner of Civil Service [4, 5]. Although the Supreme Court eventually upheld the July 20 order in L-12590, Solivio's subsequent motion for execution was quashed by the lower court on the ground that the July 6 order had been complied with and the July 20 order had become academic due to his dismissal [6, 7]. Solivio filed this petition for certiorari and mandamus [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is entitled to a writ of execution for his reinstatement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the order of July 6, 1957, became *functus officio* when it was implemented and the petitioner assumed office on July 9, 1957 [8]. Regarding the order of July 20, 1957, lifting the suspension, the Court held it had become purely academic [9, 10]. The order was expressly issued "without prejudice to the continuation of the administrative charges," and the petitioner was subsequently found guilty and dismissed by the Municipal Council and the Commissioner of Civil Service [10]. To order reinstatement would effectively annul the decision of the Commissioner of Civil Service, which was rendered in the exercise of valid jurisdiction and was not an issue in the case [10].

The writ prayed for is DENIED [11].
