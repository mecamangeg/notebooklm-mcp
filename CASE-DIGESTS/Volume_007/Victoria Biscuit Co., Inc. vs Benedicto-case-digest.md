I. CAPTION
VICTORIA BISCUIT CO., INC. v. JORGE BENEDICTO, REGIONAL OFFICE 3, P.G. MALIWANAG, RUBEN F. SANTOS, LABOR STANDARDS COMMISSION, SHERIFF OF RIZAL PROVINCE and DIONISIO BANIA, G.R. No. L-18800, March 30, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Dionisio Bania filed a complaint for overtime and separation pay against Petitioner Victoria Biscuit Co., Inc. with Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor. The Hearing Officer dismissed the complaint, but the Labor Standards Commission (LSC) reversed the decision on appeal and awarded Bania P904.87. Petitioner appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. Instead of filing an answer, Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the Regional Office and the LSC lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter. Bania manifested his conformity to the dismissal. Consequently, the CFI dismissed the case.

Later, the LSC issued a writ of execution to enforce its decision, and the Sheriff garnished Petitioner’s bank deposits. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition. The trial court denied the petition, ruling that the dismissal of the case in the CFI operated as a withdrawal of the appeal, which had the effect of reviving the LSC’s decision.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the appeal in the CFI revived the decision of the Labor Standards Commission.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s judgment. It ruled that Regional Office No. 3 and the Labor Standards Commission had no jurisdiction over money claims for overtime and separation pay, citing the doctrine in *Corominas v. Labor Standards Commission*. Because the administrative bodies lacked jurisdiction, their decision was null and void *ab initio* and could not be enforced by a writ of execution [1].

The Court held that the dismissal of the appeal in the CFI did not revive the LSC decision because the decision was legally non-existent due to the lack of jurisdiction. Furthermore, even if the respondent conformed to the dismissal, the consent of the parties cannot confer jurisdiction upon a body where the law has not granted it [2]. Jurisdiction is fixed by law, not by agreement. Thus, the LSC decision remained void and unenforceable. The petition for certiorari was granted, and the LSC decision was declared null and void [3].
