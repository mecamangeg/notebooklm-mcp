I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. ENRIQUE MAGLANOC, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Quezon and TIU SAN alias ANGEL GOMEZ, G.R. No. L-16848, February 27, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Tiu San obtained a favorable decision for naturalization from the Court of First Instance of Quezon on July 13, 1950. However, his petition to take the oath of allegiance after the two-year probationary period was denied because he was convicted of violating a municipal ordinance in Lucena during that period. The Supreme Court affirmed this denial in 1955 (*G.R. No. L-7301*), finalizing the rejection [1], [2].

On December 23, 1957, the President granted Tiu San an absolute pardon for the violation. Based on this pardon, Tiu San filed a new petition on January 27, 1958, and a subsequent one dated January 30, 1959, seeking the issuance of the naturalization certificate [3], [4]. When Respondent Judge Maglanoc set the petition for hearing, the Republic filed this petition for certiorari and prohibition, arguing that the proceedings had already been terminated and the judgment could not be revived [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an absolute pardon granted after the final denial of a petition for oath-taking can revive a decision granting naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the failure of an applicant to pass the two-year probationary period results in the loss of whatever rights he may have acquired under the decision authorizing his naturalization. Such a decision is rendered nullified and can no longer be revived and declared valid and executory [6], [7].

The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Isasi v. Republic* and the previous *Tiu San* case, holding that once the order denying the certificate of naturalization becomes final, the naturalization proceeding is terminated [7]. The absolute pardon is irrelevant because it was granted subsequent to the denial of the first petition. A pardon has no retrospective operation and cannot affect judicial proceedings that have already been terminated [8], [9].

The petition is granted; the order setting the petition for hearing is annulled, and the respondent Judge is enjoined from acting further on the matter [4].
