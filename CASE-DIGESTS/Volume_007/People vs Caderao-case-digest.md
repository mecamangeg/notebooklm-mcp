I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PROCOPIO CADERAO and ASSOCIATED INSURANCE AND SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-15699, April 22, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Accused Procopio Caderao was convicted of estafa and admitted to bail with Associated Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. (appellant) as bondsman. Caderao requested multiple extensions to surrender to settle his civil liabilities and family affairs. On November 9, 1956, the trial court granted a "last and final extension" until December 31, 1956, expressly ordering the bondsman to produce the accused by that date. Caderao failed to appear on the deadline. The surety apprehended and surrendered him only on January 4, 1957 (four days late), and subsequently moved for the cancellation of the bond. The trial court denied the motion and rendered judgment on the bond for P500.00 (partial confiscation). The surety appealed, arguing that the extension granted to the accused prevented them from arresting him earlier and that his subsequent surrender should exonerate them.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the surety is liable for the partial confiscation of the bond despite the production of the accused after the deadline.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The surety is liable. The Court held that the bonding company's responsibility is to produce the accused whenever required, and failure to do so constitutes a breach. The November 9 order explicitly directed the surety to produce the accused not later than December 31, 1956.

Mere production of the accused after failure to appear does not exonerate the surety as a matter of right; satisfactory reasons for the non-appearance must be given (Sec. 15, Rule 110). The Court rejected the argument that the extension rendered the surety powerless to arrest the accused. Upon assuming the obligation of bail, sureties become in law the "jailers of their principal" and are subrogated to the government's rights to control him (*U.S. v. Addison*). They may arrest and surrender the principal at pleasure to discharge their liability, and no court process or warrant is necessary for this exercise (Sec. 16 and 17, Rule 110). Finally, the Court ruled that mitigating the liability to P500.00 rather than complete exoneration was a proper exercise of the lower court's discretion (*People v. Daisin*).

Judgment affirmed.
