I. CAPTION
GAUDENCIO VERA, ET AL. v. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-18184, January 31, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Gaudencio Vera and others were charged with the complex crime of kidnapping with murder of Amadeo Lozanes in the Court of First Instance of Quezon [1]. Petitioners invoked the benefits of the Amnesty Proclamation (No. 8) for guerrilla activities, so the case was referred to the Eighth Guerrilla Amnesty Commission [1]. During the Commission hearings, none of the petitioners admitted to the crime; in fact, Vera categorically denied killing Lozanes [2]. Consequently, the Commission declared it could not take cognizance of the case because amnesty benefits can only be invoked by defendants who admit the crime but plead it was in furtherance of the resistance [2]. The Commission also found that the killing was motivated by rivalry between Vera's guerrilla group and the Hunter's ROTC (to which Lozanes belonged), and not in furtherance of the resistance [3, 4]. The Commission remanded the case to the court of origin [2]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the Commission's order [5, 6]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that under *Barrioquinto v. Fernandez*, admitting the crime is not a condition precedent to amnesty [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioners can invoke the benefits of amnesty without admitting the commission of the crime charged.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the invocation of amnesty is in the nature of a plea of confession and avoidance [7]. This means the pleader must admit the allegations against him but disclaim liability due to intervening facts [7, 8].

The Court ruled that the doctrine in *Barrioquinto* relied upon by petitioners has been superseded by the subsequent cases of *People v. Llanita* and *People v. Guillermo* [8]. Amnesty presupposes the commission of a crime, and when an accused maintains he has not committed a crime, he cannot have any use for amnesty [8]. Furthermore, the facts established that the killing was due to rivalry between guerrilla outfits, which does not fall under the scope of Amnesty Proclamation No. 8, as the act was not in furtherance of resistance to the enemy [9, 10].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [11].
