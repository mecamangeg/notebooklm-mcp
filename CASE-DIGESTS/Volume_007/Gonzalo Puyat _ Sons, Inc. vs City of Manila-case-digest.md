I. CAPTION
GONZALO PUYAT & SONS, INC. v. CITY OF MANILA AND MARCELO SARMIENTO, G.R. No. L-17447, April 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Gonzalo Puyat & Sons, Inc., a furniture manufacturer, was assessed retail dealer's taxes by the defendant City Treasurer of Manila on the sales of its manufactured furniture [1-3]. Believing it was liable, the plaintiff paid the taxes quarterly from the first quarter of 1950 to the third quarter of 1956, amounting to P33,785.00, without protest [4, 5]. It is undisputed that under the Revised Charter of Manila, the plaintiff is actually exempt from said taxes [6].

On October 30, 1956, the plaintiff filed a formal request for a refund with the City Treasurer, which was denied [7]. The plaintiff filed a suit for refund. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila ruled in favor of the plaintiff, ordering a refund of P29,824.00, holding that while payments made in 1950 had prescribed, those from 1951 onwards were recoverable within the six-year prescriptive period under the New Civil Code [1, 8]. The defendants appealed, arguing that the failure to pay under protest barred recovery and that the action had prescribed [9, 10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the taxes paid without protest are refundable.
2. W/N the claim for refund has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the amounts paid are recoverable even without protest. The payments were made through error or mistake, falling under the principle of *solutio indebiti* (Art. 2154, Civil Code) [6, 11]. Under Art. 2155 of the Civil Code, payment made by reason of a mistake in the construction of a doubtful or difficult question of law may be recovered [12]. Since the City had no right to demand the tax and the plaintiff paid in the erroneous belief it was due, the obligation to return arises [13]. Furthermore, Section 76 of the Manila Charter, which bars suits unless taxes are paid under protest, applies only to *real estate taxes*, not retail dealer's taxes [14, 15].

2. **YES (in part).** The action has prescribed with respect to payments made before October 30, 1950. The applicable prescriptive period for quasi-contracts like *solutio indebiti* is six years [16]. Under Art. 1155 of the Civil Code, prescription is interrupted by a written extra-judicial demand [14, 17]. Since the plaintiff made a written demand on October 30, 1956, only the payments made within the six years prior to that date (on or after October 30, 1950) are recoverable [17].

The decision appealed from is MODIFIED so that only payments made on or after October 30, 1950 shall be refunded; affirmed in all other respects [17].
