I. CAPTION
CASCO PHILIPPINE CHEMICAL CO., INC. v. HON. PEDRO GIMENEZ and HON. ISMAEL MATHAY, G.R. No. L-17931, February 28, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Casco Philippine Chemical Co., Inc., a manufacturer of synthetic resin glues, imported "urea" and "formaldehyde" as main raw materials and paid the required margin fees under the Foreign Exchange Margin Fee Law (R.A. No. 2609). Casco subsequently sought a refund, claiming that the separate importation of these chemicals was exempt under Section 2, paragraph XVIII of the law. The specific provision exempts "Urea formaldehyde for the manufacture of plywood and hardboard."

The Auditor of the Central Bank refused to approve the refund, ruling that "urea formaldehyde" refers to a specific finished product (a synthetic resin), distinct from the separate raw materials "urea" and "formaldehyde." The Auditor General affirmed this denial. Casco petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing that the bill approved by Congress originally contained the conjunction "and" (reading "urea *and* formaldehyde"), citing statements from Senators on the floor to prove that the omission of "and" in the final printed text was a mistake.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the enrolled bill containing the term "urea formaldehyde" can be altered by the Court to read "urea and formaldehyde" based on alleged legislative intent and printing errors.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that "urea formaldehyde" is a finished product patently distinct from "urea" and "formaldehyde" [1]. The Court applied the **Enrolled Bill Doctrine**, stating that the enrolled bill is conclusive upon the courts as regards the tenor of the measure passed by Congress and approved by the President [2].

Individual statements made by members of Congress on the floor do not necessarily reflect the intent of the entire legislature [2, 3]. If there was a mistake in the printing of the bill before it was certified and approved, the remedy is by amendment or curative legislation, not by judicial decree [2, 4]. The importation of "urea" and "formaldehyde" is therefore not exempt from the margin fee. The petition is denied.
