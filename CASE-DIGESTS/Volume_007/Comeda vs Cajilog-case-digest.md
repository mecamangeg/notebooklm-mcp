**I. CAPTION**
GUILLERMO COMEDA v. E. O. CAJILOG and CORNELIO O. TAN, G.R. No. L-18258, April 27, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Cornelio O. Tan filed an action for a sum of money against petitioner Guillermo Comeda in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental. Comeda appeared on the initial hearing date (April 28, 1958) and requested time to file an answer, which was granted. The hearing was reset to May 5, 1958. On said date, Comeda failed to arrive on time and was declared in default; the JP Court received the plaintiff's evidence. Barely one hour and 15 minutes later, Comeda appeared, filed his answer, and asked for a new trial [1-3]. The JP Court disregarded this plea and rendered a decision on the merits. Comeda filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Misamis Occidental to annul the default order and decision. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the proper remedy was appeal, not certiorari [3, 4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Justice of the Peace Court committed grave abuse of discretion in declaring the petitioner in default and deciding the case without giving him a chance to be heard.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the Justice of the Peace Court abused its discretion. The petitioner actually appeared on the original hearing date, and on the second date, he was late by only one hour and 15 minutes, immediately requesting an opportunity to be heard upon arrival [4, 5]. Fairness and justice demanded that a hearing be granted, especially considering that when the petitioner's request was made, the court had not yet rendered its decision on the merits [6].

The Court cited *Section 14, Rule 4 of the Rules of Court* and *Carballo v. Encarnacion*, noting that in JP courts, failure to appear—not failure to answer—is the ground for default. Since the petitioner had previously appeared and eventually appeared on the day of trial (albeit late), strict default was improper [5, 7, 8]. Consequently, the petition for certiorari was the proper remedy to redress the abuse of discretion [6].

**WHEREFORE**, the order appealed from is set aside. The case is remanded to the court *a quo* for further proceedings. [9]
