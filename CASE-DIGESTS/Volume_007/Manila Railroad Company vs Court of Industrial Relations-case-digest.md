I. CAPTION
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and KAPISANAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA SA MANILA RAILROAD, G.R. No. L-18389, January 31, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On February 10, 1950, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) rendered a decision in Case No. 270-V granting benefits, including night differential pay, to workers of the Manila Railroad Company (MRR). The respondent Union subsequently filed a motion praying that MRR be required to pay night differential to "Gate Crossing Keepers" for the period of 1950 [1]. MRR opposed the motion, arguing that these employees were not covered by the original judgment and that the move to execute the judgment had prescribed, as more than five years had elapsed since the 1950 decision, citing *National Development Company v. Aralar* [1].

The CIR granted the Union's motion. It found that while the Gate Crossing Keepers were not originally listed, they were similarly situated to the beneficiaries and thus entitled to the judgment [2]. Regarding prescription, the CIR noted that the execution of the 1950 decision had been suspended due to MRR's poor financial condition. Records showed the parties agreed to defer enforcement of the demand until January 1, 1956 [3]. The Union filed the motion for an alias writ of execution on June 8, 1960. MRR petitioned the Supreme Court for review [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Gate Crossing Keepers are entitled to the benefits of the 1950 judgment despite not being originally named.
2. W/N the Union's motion for execution is barred by the five-year prescriptive period.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The benefits of a judgment in favor of some laborers in a company are extended to other laborers in the same company who are similarly situated [5]. The Court held that workers involved in a dispute include other workers, unionists or not, who are presumed interested in the outcome of the demands [6]. As the Gate Crossing Keepers were workers of the company before and subsequent to the judgment and were similarly situated, the benefits extend to them [6].

2. **NO.** While judgments generally must be enforced by motion within five years, the time during which execution is stayed by agreement of the parties is not included in computing this period [7, 8]. The Court found that the execution was deferred until January 1, 1956, due to the company's financial difficulties and a mutual agreement approved by the trial court [9]. Since this suspension was for the benefit of the debtor (MRR), the prescriptive period did not run during the deferment. Counting from the expiration of the suspension on January 1, 1956, the motion filed on June 8, 1960, was well within the five-year period allowed by law [9, 10]. The Order of the CIR is affirmed [10].
