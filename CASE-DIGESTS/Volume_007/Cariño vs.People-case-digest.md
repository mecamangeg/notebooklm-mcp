I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO R. CARIÑO v. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES and THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-14752, April 30, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Francisco Cariño, a ranking employee and Public Relations Officer of the National City Bank of New York, was charged as an accomplice in the crime of rebellion. He was a close friend and former classmate of Dr. Jesus Lava, a top-ranking leader of the Hukbalahap (Huks). The evidence showed that Cariño: (1) provided shelter to Lava for one night in 1946; (2) sent cigarettes and food supplies to Lava via a messenger from 1949 to 1952; and (3) assisted communists in changing $6,000 into pesos and opening bank accounts below the minimum deposit requirement. Cariño was not a member of the Hukbalahap, did not take up arms, and did not openly participate in the uprising. The Court of First Instance convicted him as an accomplice, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that his assistance constituted acts of cooperation in the rebellion.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Cariño is liable as an accomplice in the crime of rebellion.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the decision and absolved the petitioner. The Court ruled that unlike in the crime of treason, the act of giving comfort or moral aid is not criminal in the case of rebellion or insurrection, which requires a public uprising and the taking up of arms under Article 134 of the Revised Penal Code [1, 2].

To be liable as an accomplice under Article 18, a person must cooperate in the execution of the offense by previous or simultaneous acts with the intent of supplying aid in an *efficacious way* (*People v. Tamayo*). The Court held that Cariño's acts of sending supplies and assisting with banking transactions—which were part of his legitimate functions as a bank employee—were not efficacious enough to help in the successful prosecution of the rebellion [3]. Furthermore, good faith is presumed, and acts that are in themselves legitimate do not prove a criminal intent to help overthrow the government [4].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Justices Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred; Justice Padilla took no part) [5].
