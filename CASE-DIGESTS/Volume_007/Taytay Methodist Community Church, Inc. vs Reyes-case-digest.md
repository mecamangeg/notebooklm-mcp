I. CAPTION
TAYTAY METHODIST COMMUNITY CHURCH, INC. v. ELADIO M. REYES and PHILIPPINES ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE METHODIST CHURCH, G.R. No. L-15731, April 27, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
The case involves a dispute over the ownership and administration of church properties in Taytay, Rizal, claimed by two rival groups within the Taytay Congregation of the Methodist Church: the "Reyes Group" (loyal to the Philippines Annual Conference, defendants-appellants) and the "Candelaria Group" (Taytay Methodist Community Church, Inc., plaintiff-appellee) [1]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal ruled that the properties belonged to the Taytay Congregation and ordered the Reyes Group to reimburse the Candelaria Group P44,140.00 (half the property value) to acquire exclusive ownership, or vice versa; otherwise, the properties would be sold at public auction [2, 3]. The defendants appealed directly to the Supreme Court, claiming the value of the properties exceeded P50,000.00 (the jurisdictional amount at the time) and arguing that the properties belonged exclusively to the Conference [3, 4]. The trial court's decision was based on a partial stipulation of facts and the testimonies of witnesses [2, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the case falls within the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals. The trial court reached its conclusion based not only on stipulated facts but mainly on the testimonies of witnesses regarding points not covered by the stipulation [4]. Because the appeal questions the trial court's conclusions drawn from this evidence, it raises both questions of law and fact [4, 5]. Under the Judiciary Act as amended, appeals raising both questions of law and fact are within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals [4, 5].

Appeal remanded to the Court of Appeals for decision in accordance with law [6].
