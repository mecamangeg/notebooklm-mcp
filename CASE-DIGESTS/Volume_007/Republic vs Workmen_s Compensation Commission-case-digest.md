**I. CAPTION**
**REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES (PHILIPPINE NORMAL HALL) v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and DALMACIO SONGALLA**, G.R. No. L-17813, April 30, 1963, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
Dalmacio Songalla was an assistant cook at the Philippine Normal Hall, a public school adjunct operated by the Republic. On June 6, 1956, while uncorking a thermos bottle for Dr. Florencia Herrera, a boarder at the Hall, hot water splashed onto Songalla's left eye [1]. The injury developed into glaucoma, resulting in the permanent total disability of the eye. Songalla filed a claim for compensation. The Regional Office awarded the claim, which was affirmed by the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) en banc [1, 2]. The Republic appealed, arguing that the Hall is exempt from the Workmen's Compensation Act, that the injury resulted from an "uncalled for act of courtesy" unrelated to employment, and that the claim was not validly controverted [2, 3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the employee is covered by the Workmen’s Compensation Act.
2. W/N the injury arose out of and in the course of employment.
3. W/N the Republic failed to controvert the claim within the statutory period.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** As an assistant cook in the Philippine Normal Hall, the claimant performed manual labor in the service of the National Government or one of its instrumentalities. Therefore, he is entitled to benefits pursuant to Section 3 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act [3, 4].

2. **YES.** The injury was the result of an accident arising out of and in the course of employment. Dr. Herrera was a boarder entitled to the services of the cook. Even if the act of uncorking the bottle was an "uncalled for gesture of courtesy," it does not detract from the work connection [5, 6]. Furthermore, the Republic only alleged the act was done in a "negligent manner," which is insufficient to relieve an employer from liability; the law requires "notorious negligence" under Section 4 of Act 3428 [7, 8].

3. **YES.** The Republic failed to file the necessary report within the 10-day period prescribed by Section 45 of the Act after acquiring knowledge of the claim. By failing to controvert on time, the employer is deemed to have renounced the right to controvert the claim and waived defenses such as prescription or negligence [7, 9]. No reasonable grounds were submitted to reinstate this right [10].

The decision and resolution appealed from are **AFFIRMED** [11].
