I. CAPTION
KAMUNING THEATER, INC. and LORETO F. STEWART v. QUEZON CITY and NORBERTO S. AMORANTO, Mayor of Quezon City, G.R. No. L-19136, February 28, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On January 20, 1956, the Quezon City Council approved Resolution No. 2496 authorizing petitioner Loreto F. Stewart to operate a "supermarket" in Project 4. The resolution defined "supermarket" as a place for the sale of commodities such as meat, fresh fruits, and vegetables "that are refrigerated" [1]. Stewart, however, engaged in the sale of *unrefrigerated* fresh meat, fish, and other perishable goods [2]. Consequently, on May 5, 1959, the City Council approved Resolution No. 4761, amending the previous resolution to withdraw the privilege of selling foodstuffs and perishable goods from the supermarket [3].

Petitioners filed an action for injunction, arguing Resolution No. 4761 was void for violating due process and impairing the obligation of contracts [4], [5]. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of petitioners, declaring the resolution void because they had installed refrigeration equipment. The Court of Appeals reversed this decision, holding that the decisive issue was not the presence of equipment but the lack of authority to sell *unrefrigerated* goods under Resolution No. 2496 [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Resolution No. 4761 is unconstitutional for violating due process and the impairment clause.
2. W/N petitioners are entitled to a period to comply with the requirements under Article 1191 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
1. **YES, but only insofar as it prohibits the sale of refrigerated goods.** The Court held that Resolution No. 4761 literally withdrew the right to sell perishable goods "without any qualification," effectively prohibiting even *refrigerated* goods. To the extent it excludes the right to sell goods *even if refrigerated*, the resolution amounts to a "denial of due process and to an infringement of the impairment clause under the Constitution" [7], [8]. However, the Court affirmed that under the original Resolution No. 2496, petitioners were never authorized to sell *unrefrigerated* goods [9]. Thus, they may only sell perishables if they are refrigerated [10].

2. **NO.** Article 1191 of the Civil Code allows courts to fix a period for compliance in cases of rescission. However, since Resolution No. 2496 never authorized the petitioners to sell *unrefrigerated* goods, there was no obligation regarding such goods to begin with. Consequently, "there could be no possible extension of time... within which to comply with the supposed requirements... for the sale of unrefrigerated perishable goods" [11], [12].

The decision of the Court of Appeals was affirmed with the qualification that petitioners shall not be deprived of the right to sell perishable goods *if refrigerated* [10].
