I. CAPTION
TATALON BARRIO COUNCIL v. THE CHIEF ACCOUNTANT of the Bank of the Philippine Islands, HON. HERMOGENES CALUAG, J.M. TUASON & CO., INC., ATTYS. JOSE TUASON, JR., RODOLFO CALUAG, DOMINGO D. SISON, and RAFAEL CALUAG, G.R. No. L-18360, January 31, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Tatalon Barrio Council filed a criminal complaint for violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (R.A. 3019) and Article 216 of the Revised Penal Code against respondents J.M. Tuason & Co. and others before the Manila City Fiscal [1, 2]. During the preliminary investigation, the fiscal issued a subpoena *duces tecum* requiring the Cashier/Treasurer of the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) to produce the savings and current accounts of the respondents [1, 2]. The bank official refused to comply, invoking Republic Act No. 1405 (Bank Secrecy Law), which prohibits the disclosure of information concerning bank deposits [2].

Petitioners filed a petition for *mandamus* with the Court of First Instance of Manila to compel the production of the records [3]. The lower court granted the respondents' motion to dismiss, ruling it lacked jurisdiction because the documents were privileged [3, 4]. Petitioners appealed, arguing the fiscal has the power to compel production of evidence to determine a *prima facie* case [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N bank deposits may be disclosed in a criminal prosecution for violations of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act and Article 216 of the Revised Penal Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that savings and current accounts are privileged documents falling within the protection of Republic Act No. 1405 [1, 5]. Section 2 of the Act considers all deposits of an "absolutely confidential nature" and prohibits inquiry into them except in specific instances: (1) upon written permission of the depositor, (2) in cases of impeachment, (3) upon order of a competent court in cases of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials, or (4) in cases where the money deposited is the subject matter of the litigation [6].

The Court ruled that the prosecution of criminal actions for violations of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act and Article 216 of the Revised Penal Code is not included in the exceptions enumerated in Section 2 [1, 7]. The policy of the law is to encourage deposits and discourage private hoarding [7]. Since the bank official was merely performing a duty enjoined by law to protect privileged matters, the lower court correctly dismissed the petition for *mandamus* [4].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [4].
