I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MAXIMINO PLAZA, G.R. No. L-18819, March 30, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
The prosecution filed an information for estafa in the Municipal Court of Butuan City against Maximino Plaza and the spouses Esperanza Ato de Lamboyog and Capistrano Lamboyog [1]. The information alleged that on October 6, 1954, the three accused conspired to defraud Felipe F. Paular [2]. It stated that the Lamboyog spouses sold a parcel of land to their co-accused Plaza, pretending to be the sole owners, despite knowing the land had previously been sold to Paular in 1953 [3]. However, the information also contained allegations implying that the Lamboyog spouses falsely represented to Plaza that the property was free from encumbrance, suggesting Plaza might not have known about the previous sale [4]. Plaza filed a motion to quash on the ground that the facts charged did not constitute an offense insofar as he was concerned [4]. The lower court granted the motion and dismissed the information against Plaza [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in dismissing the information against Plaza without giving the prosecution an opportunity to amend it.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal was improper. The Court noted that the real defect in the information was not that the facts failed to constitute an offense, but that the allegations regarding Plaza's participation were vague [4, 5]. The information contained contradictory averments: alleging conspiracy on one hand, while implying Plaza was a victim of his co-accused's misrepresentation on the other [4].

Even assuming the facts alleged did not constitute a punishable offense, the trial court should not have dismissed the case outright. Pursuant to Section 7, Rule 113 of the Rules of Court (now Rule 117), the court should have given the prosecution an opportunity to amend the information [6, 7]. It is a settled rule that when a motion to quash is based on a defect curable by amendment, the court must order the filing of another information or the amendment of the one already filed [7].

The order of dismissal was set aside, and the case was remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings [8].
