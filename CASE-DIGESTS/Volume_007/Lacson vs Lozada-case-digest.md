I. CAPTION
FELIX LACSON v. FELINA T. LOZADA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18174, April 30, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On July 12, 1950, spouses Antonio and Felina Lozada obtained a loan of P4,800.00 from Felix Lacson, payable in one year with 12% interest. When the spouses failed to pay, Lacson filed a collection suit against them in the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental. The Lozadas filed an answer claiming a counterclaim [1, 2].

During the hearing, the defense introduced a deposition of Antonio Lozada admitting the debt. Lacson, considering his advanced age of 81 and desire to avoid costly litigation, manifested his willingness to accept a reduced amount of P3,800.00. The parties subsequently submitted an "Agreed Stipulation of Facts" reflecting this compromise and praying for judgment "strictly in accordance" with the stipulation. The trial court rendered judgment ordering the Lozadas to pay P3,800.00 based on this stipulation. The Lozadas moved for reconsideration to reopen the case so they could prove their counterclaim, as the judgment did not address it. The trial court denied the motion, prompting this appeal [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in denying the motion to reopen the case to prove the counterclaim after rendering judgment based on the stipulation of facts.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court did not err in denying the motion. The "Agreed Stipulation of Facts" was submitted by the parties specifically to put an end to the litigation and obviate the necessity of submitting further evidence [4]. The plaintiff expressly agreed to accept a lesser amount than what was originally owed "in order to terminate this case once and for all" [5]. Furthermore, the stipulation prayed for judgment to be rendered *strictly* in accordance with its terms, and it contained no mention or reservation regarding the defendants' counterclaim [5]. If the appellants intended to pursue their counterclaim, they should have made a reservation to that effect in the stipulation. The Court also noted that the counterclaim, which alleged harassment, had no basis because the institution of the action was justified by the facts of record [4].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [6].
