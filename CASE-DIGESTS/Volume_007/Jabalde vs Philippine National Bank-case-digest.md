I. CAPTION
PERFECTO JABALDE v. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, G.R. No. L-18401, April 27, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellant Perfecto Jabalde filed a suit to recover P10,000.00 allegedly deposited with the Philippine National Bank (PNB). He claimed P5,000 was deposited on July 21, 1941, in genuine currency, and another P5,000 on August 30, 1943, in mixed currency [1]. PNB admitted the deposits but denied the dates and currency, alleging the true dates were July 21, 1944, and August 30, 1944, and that all deposits were in Japanese military notes [2]. PNB's answer was not under oath [2].

The Court of First Instance of Cebu dismissed the complaint. It found that the passbook entries were tampered with (changing "1944" to "1941" and "1943") and that bank records showed Jabalde opened a wartime "free account" using only Japanese military notes [3, 4]. The case was elevated to the Supreme Court due to the constitutional question regarding Executive Order No. 49, which declared wartime deposits void [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N PNB's failure to deny the passbook entries under oath constituted a conclusive admission of their genuineness.
2. W/N Executive Order No. 49 is unconstitutional for impairing the obligation of contracts.
3. W/N the bank's alleged promise to pay when indemnified constituted a novation of the deposit contract.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** While a failure to deny under oath the genuineness and due execution of an actionable document ordinarily constitutes an admission, the plaintiff waived this protection. Jabalde introduced evidence to support his alleged deposit dates and failed to object to PNB's evidence (testimonies and business sheets) showing different dates and tampering [7, 8]. Citing *Legarda Koh v. Ongsiako* and *Yu Chuck v. Kong Li Po*, the Court ruled that a party waives the technical admission if they allow the introduction of evidence to the contrary without objection [7, 9].

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the constitutionality of Executive Order No. 49, which declared deposits made in Japanese military notes null and void. Relying on *Hilado v. De la Costa*, the Court held that E.O. No. 49 was a valid exercise of extraordinary police powers under Commonwealth Act No. 671 and did not deprive the depositor of property without due process or impair contract obligations, as Japanese war notes were not legal tender in liberated territories [10, 11]. E.O. No. 49 was intended for permanent application, not just for the emergency period [10, 12].

3. **NO.** A promise to pay cannot novate the contract because there was no valid contract to novate in the first place. Since the object of the contract (the Japanese military notes) was declared null and void by law, the contract was non-existing due to the lack of an essential element (object) [12, 13].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [14].
