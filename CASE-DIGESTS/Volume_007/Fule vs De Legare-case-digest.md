I. CAPTION
CONRADO C. FULE and LOURDES F. ARAGON v. EMILIA E. DE LEGARE and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-17951, February 28, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Emilia E. de Legare was the owner of a house and lot in San Juan, Rizal [1]. On March 29, 1953, an intruder forced her to sign a document at gunpoint, after which her adopted son, John W. Legare, took her to a hotel to hide, claiming the intruders were "Huks" [2, 3]. The document signed was a deed of sale in favor of John, which he used, along with Emilia's certificate of title, to transfer the property to his name [3, 4]. John then hired a broker to sell the property to petitioners, Spouses Fule and Aragon [4]. The petitioners inspected the property and the title in John's possession [4]. They agreed to purchase it on the condition that the sale to John be registered first, followed by the transfer to them, before they paid the balance of the price [4]. This procedure was followed, and new titles were issued [4]. Emilia later returned, discovered the fraud, and filed a suit for annulment [3, 5]. The Court of Appeals ruled against the petitioners, invalidating their title [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners are innocent purchasers for value who acquired valid title despite the fraudulent transfer to their vendor.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals and declared the petitioners the lawful owners [7]. A purchaser in good faith is one who buys property of another without notice of any other person's right to it and pays a full and fair price [8]. While a forged or fraudulent deed is generally a nullity, it may become the root of a valid title if the certificate of title is transferred to the forger and the land is subsequently sold to an innocent purchaser [9]. The petitioners acted with diligence by relying not just on the documents but on their registrability, withholding payment until the titles were transferred [10, 11]. Under Section 55 of Act 496, the production of the owner's duplicate certificate operates as conclusive authority for the Register of Deeds to enter a new certificate, binding upon the registered owner [12, 13]. Furthermore, under Article 1434 of the Civil Code, even if John was not the owner when he sold the land, the subsequent registration in his name validated the conveyance to the petitioners by operation of law [14, 15]. The petition was granted, and the respondent's complaint was dismissed [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Bengzon concurred in the result [7].
