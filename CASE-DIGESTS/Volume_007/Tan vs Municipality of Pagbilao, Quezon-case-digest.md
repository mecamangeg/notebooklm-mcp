I. CAPTION
RAYMUNDO B. TAN, ET AL. v. THE MUNICIPALITY OF PAGBILAO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14264, April 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
The Municipality of Pagbilao, owner and operator of a wharf, enacted Ordinance No. 11, series of 1956, imposing charges on articles or merchandise loaded upon or landed from the wharf and the adjacent shoreline [1, 2]. The plaintiffs (Tan, et al.), who were fishermen and merchants transporting goods like fish and copra from Padre Burgos to Lucena via the Pagbilao wharf, were required to pay these fees [2, 3]. They paid under protest and subsequently filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon Province to declare the ordinance null and void and to claim a refund [3]. The CFI ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring the ordinance void for being enacted without lawful authority and ordering the municipality to refund the fees [4, 5]. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the municipality is authorized to establish wharves and collect wharfage fees under the Revised Administrative Code [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Municipality of Pagbilao has the power to enact Ordinance No. 11 and collect the prescribed fees.
2. W/N the plaintiffs are entitled to a refund of the fees paid under protest.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The ordinance is *ultra vires* and null and void [1, 8]. The Court ruled that the ordinance imposes a "specific tax" because it charges a specific sum by the head or number (e.g., per sack) without assessment beyond listing and classification [1, 8]. Municipalities do not have the inherent right to impose specific taxes, as taxation is an attribute of sovereignty [1, 9]. Furthermore, the charges constitute "wharfage fees" [9]. Under Section 3(t) of Commonwealth Act No. 472, it is beyond the power of a municipal council to impose wharfage fees [8, 10]. Additionally, Section 2287 of the Revised Administrative Code prohibits municipal councils from imposing taxes on goods carried into or out of the municipality in the guise of wharfage [11, 12].

2. **YES.** The plaintiffs are entitled to a refund [13]. Payments made under invalid acts or tax laws are refundable, even if the payments were voluntary (*East Asiatic Co., Ltd. v. City of Davao*) [10, 13]. In this case, the payments were not only made under an invalid ordinance but were also made under protest [13].

The judgment of the lower court is AFFIRMED.
