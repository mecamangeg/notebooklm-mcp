I. CAPTION
VICENTA CORPUS, ET AL. v. JOSE A. CORPUS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-12320, April 29, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Pio V. Corpus owned the "Hacienda Masbate," a property of over 900 hectares. In 1933, he mortgaged the property to Teodoro R. Yangco to secure a debt of P231,178.60 [1, 2]. Pio died in 1944, and Yangco died in 1939 [1, 2]. In 1951, the plaintiffs (heirs of Pio V. Corpus) filed a suit in Masbate to recover the hacienda and demand an accounting, alleging that the property was delivered to Yangco only for administration to apply the proceeds to the debt (antichresis) [1, 3].

The defendants (Executor of Yangco and the Yangco Memorial Foundation) alleged that due to Pio's failure to pay, he executed a deed of absolute conveyance in favor of Yangco in 1937, resulting in the issuance of new titles in Yangco's name [1, 3]. The trial court dismissed the complaint, finding that the preponderance of evidence favored the existence of the sale [4].

Crucially, during the probate proceedings of Yangco’s estate in 1947—where the Hacienda was listed as an asset of the estate—the plaintiffs opposed the partition but eventually entered into a "Compromise Settlement and Cession of Rights." They received P35,000.00 to relinquish all rights and claims against the Yangco Estate [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs are barred from recovering the property.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the "Compromise Settlement and Cession of Rights" executed by the plaintiffs in 1947 effectively cut off whatever claims they may have had to the Hacienda Masbate [7, 8]. The Court noted that the hacienda was explicitly listed in the inventory of Yangco's estate [8]. By accepting P35,000.00 to cede and transfer all rights and interests against the estate to the legatees, the plaintiffs waived their right to recover the property [6, 8].

Furthermore, this relinquishment served as conclusive corroboration of the defendants' evidence that Pio V. Corpus had executed a deed of absolute transfer during his lifetime [8]. The existence of the sale was further supported by the official transfer of certificates of title, which could not have occurred without the presentation of the corresponding deeds and surrender of the original titles [9, 10].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [11].
