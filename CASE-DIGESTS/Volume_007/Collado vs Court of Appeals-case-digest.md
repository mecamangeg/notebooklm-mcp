I. CAPTION
JOSE E. COLLADO, ET AL. v. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14698, March 30, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Pedro Aventura and Anacleta Galan obtained a decree of registration for two lots in Cadastral Case No. 88, resulting in the issuance of Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. C-153 on October 20, 1951. Shortly thereafter, on November 15, 1951, they sold the lots to petitioners Spouses Jose Collado and Aurora Provido, resulting in the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 11100. Prior to the sale, petitioner Collado visited the land and saw private respondent Nicomedes Copiat cultivating it. Despite being informed that the land belonged to the Copiats and not Aventura, Collado proceeded with the purchase.

Collado subsequently filed a civil action in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo to recover possession from Copiat. Meanwhile, on December 17, 1951—within one year of the decree's issuance—Copiat filed a petition for review in the cadastral case, alleging fraud. The cadastral court suspended the review proceedings to await the outcome of Collado's civil action. The trial court ruled in favor of Collado, ordering Copiat to vacate. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the decision, finding Collado was a purchaser in bad faith and declaring the registration decree null and void, ordering the cadastral court to hear the review petition. Petitioners argued the CA decision was an impermissible collateral attack on the Torrens title.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioners were purchasers in good faith.
2. W/N the Court of Appeals' decision constitutes a collateral attack on the decree of registration.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the factual findings of the Court of Appeals that the petitioners acted in bad faith. Collado was aware of the respondents' possession and claim of ownership before the purchase but proceeded anyway to deprive the Copiats of their inheritance. These factual findings are conclusive upon the Supreme Court.

2. **NO.** The attack on the title was not collateral. The respondents filed a petition for the reopening or review of the decree of registration in the cadastral case itself within the one-year period provided by Section 38 of Act 496 (Land Registration Act). Although the cadastral proceedings were suspended pending the civil action for recovery of possession, the petition for review remained a direct attack in the proper forum. Citing *De Los Reyes v. De Villa*, the Court held that courts cannot serve as instruments for injustice. The Court of Appeals correctly ordered the lower court to give due course to the petition for review in the cadastral case.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.
