I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JOSE TAN, G.R. No. L-17791, April 30, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On January 27, 1960, a complaint for homicide was filed against Jose Tan in the Justice of the Peace Court of Laoag, Ilocos Norte. After conducting the preliminary investigation, the Justice of the Peace Court dismissed the complaint on August 5, 1960, and forwarded the records to the Court of First Instance (CFI). Subsequently, the Provincial Fiscal of Ilocos Norte conducted his own preliminary investigation and filed an Information for the same offense with the CFI on September 16, 1960. Tan moved to dismiss the Information, arguing that under Republic Act No. 1799, the Fiscal could not file a new Information without first obtaining an order directing the Justice of the Peace to conduct another investigation. The CFI granted the motion and dismissed the Information. The prosecution appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Provincial Fiscal may validly file an Information after conducting his own preliminary investigation, notwithstanding the previous dismissal of the complaint by the Justice of the Peace Court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that if a Justice of the Peace dismisses a charge after due investigation, the case stands "as if no charge had been made." Therefore, the Provincial Fiscal is authorized to conduct his own investigation of the same charge under Republic Act No. 1799 (amending R.A. 732) and may file an Information in the Court of First Instance if he finds probable cause [1, 2]. The Court distinguished this from cases where the Justice of the Peace finds a *prima facie* case and elevates the records, in which instance the Fiscal need not conduct another investigation [2, 3]. Relying on the doctrine in *People v. Pervez*, *People v. Reginaldo*, and *Abubakar v. Arca*, the Court set aside the dismissal order and remanded the case for further proceedings [4].
