I. CAPTION
VILLA-REY TRANSIT, INC. v. HON. ELOY B. BELLO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18957, April 23, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On August 7, 1961, respondents (heirs of Felipe Tejada) filed a complaint for damages against petitioner Villa-Rey Transit, Inc. and its incorporators after Tejada died while a passenger on petitioner's bus. Petitioner received summons on August 18, 1961, and obtained a 10-day extension to file an answer. Within this period, petitioner’s counsel filed a "Motion to Dismiss," arguing only that the incorporators should be dropped as parties. On September 18, 1961, the trial court declared Villa-Rey Transit in default, ruling that the Motion to Dismiss pertained only to the incorporators and was not a responsive pleading for the corporation. A default judgment was rendered on September 23 awarding P70,100.00 in damages.

Petitioner filed a Motion to Lift Order of Default on September 27 and a Motion for New Trial on October 2. However, on October 4, 1961—before the trial court could resolve these pending motions—petitioner filed the present petition for Certiorari and Injunction with the Supreme Court, alleging the lower court acted without jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for certiorari is proper to challenge the default order and judgment.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Court held that the petition was **premature**. Petitioner had filed a motion to lift the order of default and a motion for new trial with the lower court but brought the matter to the Supreme Court for certiorari without giving the respondent court an opportunity to pass upon and resolve said pending motions [1, 2]. Furthermore, since the trial court had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the person, its orders—however irregular or erroneous—are orders within its jurisdiction correctable by appeal, not by certiorari [3, 4]. The Court also noted that the lower court did not abuse its discretion, as the Motion to Dismiss filed was not a responsive pleading and applied only to the other defendants [4].

Petition denied.
