I. CAPTION
JAVIER SECURITY SPECIAL WATCHMAN AGENCY and CONCEPCION D. JAVIER v. SHELL CRAFT & BUTTON CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-18639, January 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Since 1954, Federico E. Javier, using the business name "Javier Security Special Watchman Agency," was contracted to guard the premises of respondent Shell Craft & Button Corporation [1]. The contract was renewed annually, with the last renewal set to expire on December 1, 1957 [1, 2]. However, Federico died suddenly on May 9, 1957 [2]. At the time of his death, his widow and executrix, Concepcion Javier, was in Hongkong, and their children were minors [2, 3]. Needing immediate security, Shell Craft engaged another agency on the same day [2]. The heirs of Federico sued Shell Craft for breach of contract and damages for the unexpired term of the agreement [2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that the contract was *intuitu personae* and thus rights under it were not transmissible to the heirs [4, 5]. The plaintiffs appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the contract for security services was personal in nature (*intuitu personae*) and therefore terminated upon the death of Federico Javier.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the contract was terminated upon Federico's death [3]. The Court held that the contract was based on the personal qualifications of the deceased, as Shell Craft relied on Federico's personal supervision and selection of guards [5, 6]. Although Article 1161 of the old Civil Code regarding personal obligations was not specifically reenacted, the principle remains and was broadened by the new Civil Code [7, 8]. Specifically, **Article 1726** provides that when a piece of work is entrusted to a person due to their personal qualifications, the contract is rescinded upon their death [8]. Additionally, **Article 1236** states that a creditor is not bound to accept performance from a third person [8]. The Court reasoned that Shell Craft could not be compelled to repose the same trust and confidence in Federico's widow or heirs, especially given that the widow was abroad and the children were minors at the time of the exigency [3, 6].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [3].
