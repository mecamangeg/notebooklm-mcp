I. CAPTION
VICENTE MARTELINO v. MAXIMO ESTRELLA, G.R. No. L-15927, April 29, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On April 1, 1956, the Municipal Council of Makati approved Vicente Martelino's application to reopen the "Tropical Night Spot" cabaret, and Mayor Maximo Estrella issued the corresponding permit [1]. However, the Executive Secretary later enjoined the Mayor to revoke the permit, citing a violation of Republic Act No. 1224 regarding the distance of amusement places from public buildings [2]. A subsequent survey by the Provincial Governor's office revealed the cabaret was located 37.30 meters from a Catholic chapel and 178 meters from an Iglesia ni Kristo chapel [3]. Consequently, the Mayor ordered the closure of the cabaret [3]. Martelino filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction, arguing the closure was null and void. The Court of First Instance dismissed the petition, ruling that while there were no schools within the prohibited radius, the presence of the two chapels constituted a violation of the law [4]. Martelino appealed, contending that the law specifies "churches" and should not be interpreted to include "chapels" [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the two chapels located within the 200-meter radius of the cabaret are considered "churches" within the meaning of Republic Act No. 1224.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the term "church" in Section 1 of Republic Act No. 938 (as amended by R.A. 979 and R.A. 1224) includes all places suited to regular religious worship [6, 7]. The Court rejected the petitioner's argument based on *expressio unius est exclusio alterius*, stating that the essential characteristic of a church is the devotion of the place to religious services held with regularity, not the size of the building or the congregation [8, 9]. Since both the Iglesia ni Kristo and Catholic chapels held regular religious services, they fall under the legal definition of "church" [10]. The Court relied on the doctrine in *Delgado v. Roque*, which established that a chapel used for regular religious services is considered a church for the purpose of the prohibition [9, 11].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [11].
