I. CAPTION
CONRADO B. UICHANCO v. THE HONORABLE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17328, March 30, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Conrado Uichanco filed a sales application for public land in Oriental Mindoro. Following protests by third parties, the Director of Lands cancelled Uichanco’s application in November 1955. Before a reinvestigation could occur, the Office of the President directed the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources (Secretary) to take appropriate action on a separate protest regarding the land. The Secretary created a committee to investigate, in which Uichanco participated.

On December 20, 1957, the Secretary rendered a decision reinstating Uichanco's application but excluding portions occupied by the protestants. Uichanco filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing for the first time that the Secretary lacked jurisdiction because no appeal had been filed from the Director of Lands' decision. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Uichanco, declaring the Secretary's decision null and void for lack of jurisdiction. The Solicitor General appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources has jurisdiction to act directly on a land conflict without an appeal being taken from the decision of the Director of Lands.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources acted within his jurisdiction. Under Section 79(C) of the Revised Administrative Code and Section 10, Article VII of the Constitution, the Department Head exercises direct control, direction, and supervision over all bureaus under his jurisdiction. This power of "control" implies the authority to alter, modify, nullify, or set aside the acts of a subordinate and substitute the superior's judgment [1], [2].

While Lands Administrative Order No. 6 outlines the procedure for appeals from the Director of Lands, these rules are promulgated for the convenience of the Department and litigants to facilitate transactions; they do not prohibit the Secretary from acting directly on a conflict [3], [4]. It was expedient for the Secretary to decide the matter directly as it was referred by the Office of the President [4]. Furthermore, Uichanco was estopped from questioning jurisdiction as he actively participated in the Secretary's investigation and requested the expedition of the case [5].

The judgment of the Court of First Instance is reversed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
