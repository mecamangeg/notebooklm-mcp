I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MOROS TANJI AMBRAN, SAHIBUL, ISMAEL, MUKBAND, HATIB AJAK AND ARBANI, G.R. No. L-15581, April 29, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On the morning of December 29, 1957, in Basilan City, Moro Mangao, his brother, and his cousin were walking to work when they were intercepted by a group of eleven to twelve men, including the accused Tanji Ambran and the appellants Sahibul, Ismael, Mukband, Hatib Ajak, and Arabani [1], [2]. Witnesses testified that Tanji Ambran initiated the attack by spearing Mangao in the stomach, after which the other accused hacked the victim on all sides [1], [2]. The victim’s companions fled and later found Mangao’s body at a road intersection with multiple wounds [1].

Tanji Ambran admitted to killing Mangao but claimed he acted alone in defense of his honor, alleging he caught Mangao abusing his wife in his house [3]. The other appellants denied participation, raising defenses of alibi [4]. The Court of First Instance of Basilan City convicted all accused of murder and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua* [5]. Tanji Ambran did not appeal; the case proceeded regarding the other appellants [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appellants participated in the killing of Mangao and are guilty of murder.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, ruling that the evidence conclusively established the appellants' participation [7], [8].

The Court held that the existence of nineteen (19) wounds on various parts of the victim's body—including the nape, back, and shoulders—negated the defense's claim that the wounds were inflicted by only one person [9], [10]. The nature and location of these wounds confirmed the prosecution witnesses' testimony that the victim was attacked from all sides by many persons [9], [10]. Furthermore, the fact that the body was found at a road intersection, far from Tanji Ambran's house, belied the claim that the killing occurred at Tanji’s house due to the alleged abuse of his wife [11], [12].

The appellants were positively identified by three witnesses who knew them personally, rendering their alibis and claims of mistaken identity untenable [11], [7]. The Court found that the accused conspired to attack and kill the deceased, with the crime qualified by *alevosia* (treachery) and aggravated by superior strength [6].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [8].
