I. CAPTION
HONORIO M. BARRIOS v. CARLOS A. GO THONG & COMPANY, G.R. No. L-17192, March 30, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On May 1, 1958, plaintiff Honorio Barrios, captain of the MV *Henry I* (owned by William Lines), intercepted an SOS signal from the MV *Don Alfredo* (owned by defendant Go Thong & Co.), which had suffered engine failure. Barrios steered his vessel to the *Don Alfredo*, secured it with tow lines, and towed it towards Dumaguete. At the time, the weather was fair, clear, and the sea was smooth with only ripples. The *Don Alfredo* was drifting but was far from any island or rocks, and there was no danger of it floundering. The following morning, the *Don Alfredo*'s sister ship arrived, and the tow lines were released. Barrios filed a suit claiming reward under the Salvage Law. The Court of First Instance dismissed the case, ruling that there was no marine peril to justify salvage and that the plaintiff could not claim for towage as his employer, William Lines, had waived compensation [1-6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the service rendered by the plaintiff constituted salvage.
2. W/N the plaintiff is entitled to remuneration for towage services.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A valid salvage claim under Act No. 2616 requires three elements: (1) a marine peril, (2) voluntary service not required by duty or contract, and (3) success (*Erlanger & Galinger v. Swedish East Asiatic Co., Ltd.*). The Court held there was no marine peril because the vessel, though helpless due to engine failure, was not in danger of sinking or stranding. The weather was fair, the sea was smooth, and the crew did not even find it necessary to lower lifeboats or jettison cargo [1, 2, 7].

2. **NO.** The service rendered was a quasi-contract of "towage," not salvage. In a contract of towage, only the owner of the towing vessel is entitled to remuneration, to the exclusion of the crew (*Sause v. United States*). Since the owner of the *Henry I* (William Lines) expressly waived its claim for compensation, the plaintiff, whose right depends on his employer's interest, is not entitled to payment. Furthermore, the plaintiff cannot invoke equity under Article 2142 of the Civil Code because there is an express legal provision governing the relationship where the crew is not entitled to separate compensation [8-12].

**Decision affirmed.**
