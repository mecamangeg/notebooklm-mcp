**I. CAPTION**
PANTALEON PACIS v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, ATANACIO NEGRE and MUNICIPAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF SANCHEZ MIRA, CAGAYAN, G.R. No. L-29026, September 28, 1968, 25 SCRA 377, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
In the 1967 elections for Mayor of Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, petitioner Pantaleon Pacis and respondent Atanacio Negre were candidates. A shooting incident occurred on November 15, 1967, resulting in the death of the Vice Mayor and causing election inspectors to flee, leaving election documents in Precincts 18, 19, 21, and 22 open and unsealed [1, 2]. Consequently, returns were tampered with.

In a prior case (*Pacis v. COMELEC*, L-28455), the Supreme Court ordered the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to investigate and ascertain the true returns for the affected precincts [3]. COMELEC’s investigation revealed: (1) For Precinct 18, the ballot box copy was authentic; (2) For Precinct 19, all copies were tampered, but the true vote was reconstructed via testimony and NBI analysis; (3) For Precinct 21, the Provincial Treasurer's copy was used based on entries written in words; and (4) For Precinct 22, the return was rejected entirely as "no return" because it was prepared at gunpoint [4-20].

Based on these findings, the Municipal Board of Canvassers (BOC) convened on May 18, 1968, canvassed the votes, and declared Negre the winner [21]. On May 21, 1968, the BOC proclaimed Negre with six members present [22, 23]. Pacis filed a petition for certiorari, arguing, among others, that the proclamation was invalid because two BOC members were not properly notified and that a judicial recount should have been ordered [21, 23].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N COMELEC has the power to order the Board of Canvassers to use its findings of correct votes and copies other than those of the municipal treasurer.
2. W/N a judicial recount is the proper remedy given the tampered returns.
3. W/N the proclamation of the respondent was valid despite the absence of two members of the Board of Canvassers.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The COMELEC possesses the power to investigate irregularities and ascertain the true results to protect the integrity of elections. The Court held that the purpose of the Election Code is to suppress evils that defeat the voters' will [24]. COMELEC has the authority to reject obviously manufactured returns or those prepared at the point of a gun, as seen in Precinct 22, which are considered "no return at all" [25, 26]. Furthermore, COMELEC properly exercised its discretion in determining the true votes for Precincts 19 and 21 through investigation and the use of untampered portions of other copies [26, 27].

2. **NO.** A judicial recount under Section 163 of the Election Code is not the proper remedy. The Court ruled that Section 163 applies only when there is a discrepancy between different copies of the election returns [28]. In this case, the returns were either all tampered with (falsified) or prepared under duress (gunpoint), resulting in no technical discrepancy between copies but rather a lack of authentic returns. The remedy in such cases of tampering is with the COMELEC, not a judicial recount with the Court of First Instance [29].

3. **YES.** The proclamation is valid. The Court found that a quorum of six out of ten members was present during the proclamation [30]. Under the law, a quorum may act for the entire body. Moreover, the Court noted that the absent members were duly notified or avoided service to delay the proceedings [31, 32]. Finally, the proclamation is merely a formal act to confirm the canvass previously held, and a new proclamation would be an idle ritual that would not change the result [33].

**WHEREFORE**, the resolution of the Commission on Elections is confirmed; the preliminary mandatory injunction is dissolved; and the canvass and proclamation of respondent Atanacio Negre are declared valid and subsisting [33].
