I. CAPTION
SOUTHWEST AGRICULTURAL MARKETING CORPORATION v. THE SECRETARY OF FINANCE, THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS and GUSTAVO A. SUAREZ, G.R. No. L-24797, October 8, 1968, 25 SCRA 452, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Southwest Agricultural Marketing Corp., an exporter of copras in Davao, objected to arrastre charges imposed by respondent Gustavo A. Suarez. Suarez held the arrastre service contract for the Port of Davao, awarded by the Commissioner of Customs on May 9, 1963 [1]. Since the Tariff and Customs Code (the Code) did not specify export arrastre charges for Davao, the Secretary of Finance authorized the adoption of the schedule for the Port of Iloilo (Section 3106(b) of the Code) in the contract, fixing the fee at P2.00 per ton [1, 2].

When Suarez attempted to collect P36,690.48, Petitioner filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to annul the contract and refund P17,988.80 paid under protest [2]. Petitioner argued the charges were illegal because the Code was silent on Davao rates [2]. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that the case fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [3]. Petitioner appealed, contending the suit was a civil action to nullify a contract, not a tax protest [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the validity of arrastre charges imposed under the Customs Law.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal [4].

The Court held that the determination of the legality of the arrastre charges requires the interpretation and construction of the Tariff and Customs Code and other laws administered by the Bureau of Customs [5]. Under Section 7(2) of Republic Act No. 1125, the Court of Tax Appeals has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review matters arising under the Customs Law or other laws administered by the Bureau of Customs [5].

The Court rejected the Petitioner's claim that the action was merely for contract annulment, noting that the prayer to annul the contract was simply a means to prevent the collection of charges [6]. Thus, it was in reality a petition to review the actuations of customs authorities [7]. While the CTA's jurisdiction typically requires a decision from the Commissioner of Customs, the absence of such a decision in this case was due to the Petitioner's failure to exhaust administrative remedies—specifically, paying the charges, filing a written protest, and appealing to the Commissioner of Customs as prescribed by Sections 2308 and 2309 of the Code [8].

Order affirmed.
