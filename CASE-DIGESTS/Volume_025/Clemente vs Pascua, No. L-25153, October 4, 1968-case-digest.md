I. CAPTION
ANTONIO CLEMENTE v. BERNARDINO PASCUA, G.R. No. L-25153, October 4, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Romualdo Gaffud originally owned a lot in Santiago, Isabela. In 1940, he sold a portion to Antonio Clemente, who took possession. A deed of absolute sale was executed in 1948, but Clemente failed to register it. In 1949, Gaffud sold the entire lot to Gregorio Cachen, who registered the sale and obtained a Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT), although he never took possession. Cachen sued Clemente for possession (Civil Case No. 275), but the trial court dismissed the complaint, declaring Clemente the owner due to his prior possession in good faith and finding Cachen’s purchase void for lack of consideration. This was affirmed by the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.

In 1962, Clemente annotated a notice of *lis pendens* regarding the previous litigation on Cachen's TCT. Subsequently, Cachen sold the lot to Bernardino Pascua. Pascua obtained a new TCT, which carried the annotation of the *lis pendens*. When Pascua attempted to take possession, Clemente filed the present action for reconveyance. The trial court rendered a summary judgment in favor of Clemente. Pascua appealed, challenging the summary judgment and claiming improper venue (alleging the land was in Nueva Vizcaya based on his tax declaration) and the existence of genuine issues of fact.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court correctly rendered a summary judgment.
2. W/N Pascua is a purchaser in good faith entitled to the property.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that there was no genuine issue of fact. Regarding venue, Pascua's claim that the land was in Nueva Vizcaya was based solely on a self-serving tax declaration, which was outweighed by the Torrens titles and pleadings admitting the land was in Santiago, Isabela. The issue of whether Clemente was declared owner in the previous case was a question of law involving the interpretation of decisions, not a question of fact. Under *Urmaneta v. Manzano*, where there is no genuine issue of fact, or it is determinable from pleadings, summary judgment is proper.

2. **NO.** Pascua cannot invoke the rights of a purchaser in good faith. He purchased the lot from Cachen *after* the notice of *lis pendens* covering the previous litigation was annotated on the title. Being aware of the proceedings, he acquired no more rights than his vendor, Cachen, who had none because his title was tainted with bad faith and lack of consideration.

**Decision affirmed.**
