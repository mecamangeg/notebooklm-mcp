**I. CAPTION**
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE and COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS v. PHILIPPINE ACE LINES, INC., G.R. Nos. L-20960-61, October 31, 1968, Angeles, J.

**II. FACTS**
Between 1959 and 1959, respondent Philippine Ace Lines, Inc. (PAL) purchased four ocean-going cargo vessels (*M/S Yakal*, *M/S Molave*, *M/S Tindalo*, and *M/S Narra*) from the Reparations Commission (Repacom) under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 1789 [1, 2]. At the time, Section 14 of R.A. No. 1789 exempted reparations goods obtained by private parties only from customs duties, consular fees, and special import tax, but not compensating tax [3]. Consequently, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed compensating taxes totaling approximately P1.4 million against PAL [4, 5]. The Commissioner of Customs placed the vessels under custody and refused clearance until taxes were paid [5].

PAL protested and filed petitions for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [3]. While the cases were pending, Congress enacted R.A. No. 3079 on June 17, 1961, which amended R.A. No. 1789 to expressly include exemption from compensating tax [6]. Section 20 of R.A. No. 3079 allowed end-users with existing contracts to "renovate" their utilization contracts to avail of provisions more favorable to them, provided they voluntarily assumed the new obligations under the amendatory act [7]. PAL renovated its contracts with Repacom to implement the tax exemption [8]. The CTA ruled in favor of PAL, cancelling the tax assessments [9, 10]. The CIR appealed, arguing that the exemption in R.A. No. 3079 should not apply retroactively to goods acquired before its enactment [10].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Philippine Ace Lines is exempt from the payment of compensating tax on reparations goods acquired prior to the effectivity of R.A. No. 3079.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA decision, applying the doctrine in *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Botelho Shipping Corporation* [11, 12].

The Court held that while R.A. No. 3079 does not explicitly declare a blanket retroactive exemption, Section 20 constitutes a "clear and explicit" mechanism for retroactivity [13]. It allows end-users who acquired goods prior to June 17, 1961, to be treated "in like manner and to the same extent" as new end-users, provided they apply for the renovation of their utilization contracts and assume all new obligations imposed by the amendatory law [14].

This requirement serves as a valuable consideration for the retroactivity of the exemption [13]. The purpose of Section 20 is to abolish discrimination between end-users who bought before and after the amendment, thereby satisfying the constitutional guarantee of equal protection [14]. Since PAL complied with the requirements by renovating its contracts, it is entitled to the exemption from compensating tax [12].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **AFFIRMED** [12].
