**I. CAPTION**
DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and/or BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-29362, September 27, 1968, Castro, J.

**II. FACTS**
Domestic Insurance Company of the Philippines, as subrogee of the consignee Philippine Union Commercial, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the Republic of the Philippines and/or the Bureau of Customs [1]. The plaintiff sought to recover P10,039.66 representing the value of three cases of dental merchandise which the Bureau of Customs, acting as the arrastre operator, failed to deliver [1]. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff [1]. The Republic appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved a pure question of law [2]. The plaintiff argued that the arrastre service is proprietary in nature, and thus the State descended to the level of an ordinary citizen and waived its immunity from suit [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Bureau of Customs is immune from suit regarding its operation of the arrastre service.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision [3]. Relying on the doctrine in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service*, the Court held that the Bureau of Customs is part of the Department of Finance and has no legal personality apart from the national government [4, 5]. Its primary function of assessing and collecting revenues is governmental, and the arrastre service is a "necessary incident" to this function [4, 5].

The Court explained that even if a function is proprietary in nature, if it is undertaken as a necessary incident to a governmental function, there is no waiver of sovereign immunity [6, 7]. Sovereign immunity granted as to the end should not be denied as to the necessary means [4, 8]. Consequently, the Bureau cannot be sued without its consent [9, 10]. The proper remedy for the plaintiff is to file a money claim with the Auditor General pursuant to Act 3083 and Commonwealth Act 327 [3, 11].

ACCORDINGLY, the judgment *a quo* is reversed, and the complaint is hereby dismissed [3].
