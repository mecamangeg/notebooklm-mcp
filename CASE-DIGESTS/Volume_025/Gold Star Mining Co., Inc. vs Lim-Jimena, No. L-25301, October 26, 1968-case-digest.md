I. CAPTION
GOLD STAR MINING CO., INC. v. MARTA LIM-JIMENA, et al., G.R. No. L-25301, October 26, 1968, 25 SCRA 597, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In 1937, Ananias Lincallo agreed to turn over to Victor Jimena one-half of the proceeds from mining claims purchased with funds advanced by Jimena [1]. This agreement was later modified to bind their heirs and assigns [1]. Lincallo assigned mining rights to petitioner Gold Star Mining Co., Inc. (Gold Star), which agreed to pay him royalties [2]. Despite Jimena's repeated demands for his share, Gold Star and Lincallo ignored him [3].

In 1954, Jimena filed a suit against Lincallo and Gold Star to recover his advances and share in royalties [4]. The trial court issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining Gold Star from paying royalties to Lincallo during the pendency of the case [5]. However, Gold Star paid PHP 30,691.92 to Lincallo and his assignee, claiming the injunction was superseded by a writ of attachment (which was never actually issued as the bond was disapproved) [5, 6]. The trial court ruled in favor of Jimena (substituted by his heirs, respondents Lim-Jimena et al.) and ordered Gold Star to pay the PHP 30,691.92 solidarily with Lincallo for violating the injunction [7]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision [8]. Gold Star appealed, arguing lack of privity of contract and that it could not be penalized for injunction violation without formal contempt proceedings [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Jimena has a cause of action against Gold Star despite the lack of privity of contract.
2. W/N Gold Star is liable for the amount paid in violation of the injunction without a separate contempt proceeding.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Although there is no privity of contract, Jimena has a cause of action on multiple grounds. First, the common subject matter supplies the juridical link, similar to first and second mortgagees [10, 11]. Second, under Article 1177 of the Civil Code, creditors may exercise all rights and bring all actions of the debtor to satisfy their claims [10, 12]. Third, Lincallo acted as Jimena's agent regarding Jimena's share; under Article 1883 of the Civil Code, the principal may sue the person with whom the agent dealt in his own name when the transaction involves things belonging to the principal [13, 14].

2. **YES.** The award is not a penalty for contempt but a decree of restitution to make the violated injunction effective [15, 16]. It places the parties in the same condition as if the injunction had been obeyed [16]. Had Gold Star not paid Lincallo, the amount would be available to satisfy Jimena's claim [17]. The payment is "to be imputed to Lincallo's liability," allowing Gold Star to recover the amount from Lincallo later [17, 18].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED** [19].
