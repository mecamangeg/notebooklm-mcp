I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE GUARDIANSHIP OF EULOGIO IMPERIAL, PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, guardian. GLORIA GOMEZ v. RUFINO IMPERIAL, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-26981, October 30, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On August 9, 1956, the Philippine National Bank (PNB) filed a petition for guardianship over Eulogio Imperial, an 85-year-old incompetent veteran, to receive his pension from the U.S. Veterans Administration. PNB requested authority to pay Gloria Gomez, the ward's granddaughter and custodian, a monthly allowance for his support. The petition alleged that the ward's near relatives had signed a "waiver, agreement and conformity" attached to the petition. The trial court granted the petition and appointed PNB as guardian.

Eulogio died on September 13, 1962. On February 8, 1964, the court approved PNB's final accounting and directed the deposit of the residuary estate for the heirs. Subsequently, the appellants (children of the deceased) moved to set aside the order, claiming the court lacked jurisdiction due to lack of notice, and demanded an accounting from Gomez. Gomez also filed a motion for compensation for her services as custodian. The lower court denied the appellants' motion and granted Gomez's compensation. The appellants appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court had jurisdiction over the guardianship proceedings despite the alleged lack of personal notice to the near relatives.
2. W/N the custodian (Gomez) is entitled to compensation for her services.
3. W/N the guardianship court may distribute the residuary estate to the heirs in the same proceeding.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the lower court had jurisdiction because the appellants had signed a "waiver, agreement and conformity" prior to the commencement of the case. In this document, they explicitly waived notice and appearance and consented to an *ex-parte* hearing pursuant to Section 19 of Republic Act No. 390 (Uniform Veterans Guardianship Act). Furthermore, the Court found it incredible that the appellants, who were residents of the same municipality, were unaware of the proceedings which had been pending for seven years.

2. **YES.** The lower court had the discretion to authorize nominal compensation (P15.00/month) for Gomez. She provided care for the ward when his own children did not volunteer to do so. The initial order granting the monthly allowance for support effectively authorized PNB to engage her services as custodian.

3. **NO.** The distribution of the residue of the deceased incompetent's estate is a function that properly pertains to a separate administration proceeding which the heirs are at liberty to initiate, not to the guardianship proceedings.

The orders appealed from are **AFFIRMED**.
