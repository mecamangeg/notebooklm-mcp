**I. CAPTION**
RESINS, INCORPORATED v. AUDITOR GENERAL OF THE PHILIPPINES and THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17888, October 29, 1968, Fernando, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Resins, Inc., a manufacturer of synthetic glue, imported "urea" and "formaldehyde" as separate units [1]. It paid margin fees to the Central Bank for these importations under Republic Act No. 2609 [1]. Petitioner subsequently sought a refund of the fees, arguing that its importation was exempt under the specific provision of R.A. 2609 which exempts "urea formaldehyde" [1]. Resins, Inc. contended that the omission of the conjunction "and" in the law was a printing error and that Congress intended to exempt the separate components used to make the glue, citing statements made by Senators on the Senate floor during the bill's deliberation [2].

The Auditor General, in an indorsement to the Central Bank, overruled a previous resolution and denied the refund [3]. He adopted a literal interpretation of the statute, ruling that the exemption applies to the finished product "urea formaldehyde" and not to the separate raw materials [3]. Resins, Inc. filed this original petition with the Supreme Court challenging the Auditor General's ruling [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the importation of urea and formaldehyde as separate units is exempt from the margin fee under R.A. 2609 which specifically exempts "urea formaldehyde."

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the petition. The Court held that the specific language of the law exempts "urea formaldehyde," which is a finished product patently distinct and different from "urea" and "formaldehyde" as separate articles [2].

Applying the doctrine in *Casco Philippine Chemical Co., Inc. v. Gimenez*, the Court ruled that the enrolled bill is conclusive upon the courts regarding the tenor of the measure passed by Congress and approved by the President [2]. Individual statements by members of Congress on the floor do not necessarily reflect the view of the Senate or the House of Representatives [2]. If there was a mistake in the printing of the bill, the remedy is by amendment or curative legislation, not by judicial decree [2].

Furthermore, the Court emphasized that a refund partakes of the nature of a tax exemption, which is not favored and is never presumed. Exempting provisions must be construed *strictissimi juris* (strictly) against the taxpayer [5]. The Auditor General was merely discharging his constitutional responsibility to ensure no public funds are released without clear authority of law [6].

Petition denied [7].
