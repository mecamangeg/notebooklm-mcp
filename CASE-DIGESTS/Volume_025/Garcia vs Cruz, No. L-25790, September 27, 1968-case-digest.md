I. CAPTION
JOSE A. GARCIA v. ADELAIDA CRUZ, G.R. No. L-25790, September 27, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Adelaida Cruz filed a suit to recover P4,000.00 representing the value of jewelry sold to Felicidad Garcia, petitioner Jose A. Garcia’s wife. Jose contended that he should not be liable because he lived separately from his wife since 1957, the transaction was without his consent, and he had adequately provided for his family. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint against Jose. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the decision, finding that Jose admitted to receiving P2,000.00 of the proceeds from his wife and promised to pay Cruz. The CA held Jose liable for P2,000.00, noting his negligence in failing to place his wife under guardianship despite knowing her habit of incurring debts. Jose appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the CA erred in ignoring the trial court's finding regarding their separation.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the husband is liable for the debt incurred by his wife despite their *de facto* separation.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision. The Court held that the factual findings of the CA regarding Jose's promise to pay are binding. Legally, the award of P2,000.00 is a debt of the conjugal partnership. Under Article 161, paragraph 5 of the Civil Code, the support of the family is one of the obligations of the community. Furthermore, under Article 178 of the Civil Code, the separation *de facto* of the spouses is without effect upon the conjugal partnership. Thus, the husband is liable for the amount used for the family's maintenance.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
