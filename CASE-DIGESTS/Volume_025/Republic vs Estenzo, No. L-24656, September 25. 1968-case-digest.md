I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES (Represented by the Land Authority) v. HON. NUMERIANO G. ESTENZO, et al., G.R. No. L-24656, September 25, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
The Land Tenure Administration (representing the Republic) instituted expropriation proceedings in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte against private respondents (Espeletas, et al.). On June 14, 1962, the CFI rendered a decision fixing the compensation at P411,995.78. Pending appeal, the parties entered into a Compromise Agreement reducing the price to P350,000.00, which the CFI approved as its Amended Decision on August 24, 1962.

When the Republic failed to pay the balance, respondents moved to annul the Amended Decision alleging fraud. On April 26, 1963, the CFI nullified the Amended Decision and revived the original June 14, 1962 decision. The Republic filed a petition for certiorari (G.R. No. L-21530) with the Supreme Court. While pending, the parties entered into a second Compromise Agreement, approved by the Supreme Court on August 5, 1964, wherein the Republic agreed to pay the balance of P143,150.00 with interest by August 31, 1964, and respondents waived claims under the April 26, 1963 order if paid.

The Republic again failed to pay in full by the deadline. Respondents then moved in the CFI for execution based on the original June 14, 1962 decision. The CFI granted the motion and garnished the Land Authority's funds. The Republic filed the present petition, arguing that the CFI lost jurisdiction to the Courts of Agrarian Relations (CAR) under the Land Reform Code (R.A. 3844) and that the orders enforcing the original decision were void.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CFI lost jurisdiction over the case to the Court of Agrarian Relations upon the effectivity of the Land Reform Code.
2. W/N the CFI acted with grave abuse of discretion in ordering the execution of the original 1962 decision instead of the 1964 Supreme Court-approved compromise.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Section 154(3) of the Land Reform Code (R.A. 3844) provides that expropriation proceedings *pending* in the CFI at the time of effectivity shall be transferred to the CAR. This case was not pending when the Code took effect on August 8, 1963; it had already been decided on June 14, 1962, and first compromised on August 24, 1962. Thus, the provision is inapplicable.

2. **YES.** The second compromise agreement, approved by the Supreme Court on August 5, 1964, superseded all previous agreements and proceedings (including the original decision and the first compromise) and constituted a final settlement of the controversy. Under Article 2037 of the Civil Code, a compromise has the effect of *res judicata*. Any execution must be based on this second compromise, not on the superseded original decision. Furthermore, the CFI's order of April 26, 1963 (reviving the original decision) was void for lack of jurisdiction. The Amended Decision (based on the first compromise) became final and executory immediately upon rendition. The petition to set it aside was filed more than six months later, beyond the non-extendible period allowed for a petition for relief under Rule 38.

Petition granted. The orders of the CFI are declared null and void.
