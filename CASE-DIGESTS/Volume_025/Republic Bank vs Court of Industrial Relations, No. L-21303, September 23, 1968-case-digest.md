I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC BANK v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and NARCISO MACARAEG, G.R. No. L-21303, September 23, 1968, 25 SCRA 55, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Macaraeg initially filed a complaint for overtime pay against petitioner Republic Bank in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) (Case No. 1104-V) [1]. The Supreme Court, in G.R. No. L-16637, previously ruled that the CIR lacked jurisdiction over the case as it was a simple money claim cognizable by ordinary courts, dismissing it "without prejudice to the filing of the claim... in any competent court" [1].

Purportedly relying on this decision, Macaraeg filed a second complaint in the CIR (Case No. 1538-V) for the same overtime pay but added a prayer for reinstatement [2]. Petitioner Bank moved to dismiss on the ground of *res judicata*, arguing the jurisdictional issue was already settled [2, 3]. The CIR Trial Judge dismissed the case, but the CIR *en banc* reversed, holding that the previous SC decision was not a judgment on the merits due to the "without prejudice" clause [3]. Meanwhile, Macaraeg had a separate pending case for unfair labor practice and reinstatement (Case No. 1751-ULP) [2, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR has jurisdiction over the second complaint (Case No. 1538-V) despite the previous dismissal in G.R. No. L-16637.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the previous decision in G.R. No. L-16637 was a final adjudication on the merits insofar as the issue of jurisdiction was concerned [5]. The phrase "without prejudice" referred to filing the claim in the *competent court* (ordinary courts), not refiling in the CIR [1, 3].

The Court found that the new complaint was a reiteration of the same claim, and the addition of the prayer for reinstatement was merely an attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court's prior denial of jurisdiction to the CIR [4, 6]. Furthermore, the issue of reinstatement was already the subject of another pending action (Case No. 1751-ULP), preventing its inclusion here [4].

The resolution of the CIR *en banc* is SET ASIDE, and the complaint is ORDERED DISMISSED [7].
