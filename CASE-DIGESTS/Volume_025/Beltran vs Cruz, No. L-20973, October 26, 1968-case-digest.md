I. CAPTION
JOSE BELTRAN v. NICANOR CRUZ, G.R. No. L-20973, October 26, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jose Beltran, a share tenant, and respondent Nicanor Cruz, the landowner, entered into a tenancy agreement which stipulated that Beltran must give one week's notice prior to harvesting. On October 28, 1960, Beltran notified Cruz of his intention to harvest on November 3, 1960, a date agreed to by Cruz's administrator. However, on November 2, 1960—one day ahead of the scheduled date—Beltran reaped the harvest without the knowledge or consent of the landowner. Cruz filed an action for ejectment in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). The CAR ruled in favor of Cruz, authorizing Beltran's ejectment for violating the contract and the tenancy law. Beltran appealed, arguing substantial compliance and lack of damage.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the tenant's act of reaping the harvest one day ahead of the mutually agreed date is sufficient cause for his dispossession.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the CAR. The Court ruled that Beltran violated Section 39 of the Agricultural Tenancy Law (R.A. 1199), which makes it unlawful for a tenant to reap or thresh any portion of the crop previous to the date set without mutual consent. Under Section 50(b) of the same Act, violation of the law or the terms of the tenancy contract is a ground for dispossession.

The Court held that strict compliance with the date of reaping is essential to statutory policy. The purpose of the advance notice requirement is to enable the landholder to witness the harvesting to ensure no part of the crop is illegally diverted. Pre-reaping in the absence of one party inevitably generates suspicion and strains the tenancy relationship. Consequently, the defenses of substantial compliance and lack of damage were rejected, and the petition was denied.
