I. CAPTION
GERVACIO VALENCIA v. CARMEN P. CRISOLOGO, as Governor of Ilocos Sur, GONZALO P. LAZO, as Vice-Mayor of Tagudin, Ilocos Sur, and the PROVINCIAL BOARD OF ILOCOS SUR, G.R. No. L-25646, October 14, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Valencia was the elected Mayor of Tagudin, Ilocos Sur (1963-1967). Following administrative complaints filed by residents for abandonment of duties, misconduct, and dishonesty [1], Respondent Governor Crisologo suspended him from office effective February 1, 1966 [1]. Valencia filed a petition for prohibition to nullify the suspension order and restrain the Provincial Board from investigating the charges, arguing the suspension violated Section 2188 of the Revised Administrative Code [2]. While the case was pending, Valencia's term expired on December 31, 1967, and Respondent Lazo was elected and proclaimed Mayor in the November 1967 elections [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition has become moot and academic due to the expiration of the petitioner's term.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the issues raised have become moot. The purpose of the petition was to prevent the petitioner’s suspension and investigation as Mayor of Tagudin [4]. However, since his term of office expired on December 31, 1967, and a new Mayor has already been elected and assumed office, there is no longer a live controversy to resolve [3]. The Court applied the doctrine in *Sarandi v. Espino* and *Grapilon v. Municipal Council of Carigara*, which established that the expiration of a term of office renders an administrative case seeking to prevent suspension moot [5].

Case dismissed [5].
