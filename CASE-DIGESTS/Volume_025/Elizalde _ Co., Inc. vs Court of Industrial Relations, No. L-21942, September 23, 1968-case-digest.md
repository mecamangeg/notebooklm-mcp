I. CAPTION
ELIZALDE & CO., INC. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and APOLINAR PERLADO, G.R. No. L-21942, September 23, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Apolinar Perlado filed a case against petitioner Elizalde & Co., Inc. with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) seeking overtime and holiday pay. On August 6, 1963, petitioner received the CIR decision ruling in favor of Perlado. On August 12, 1963, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) without supporting arguments. Under CIR rules, arguments must be filed within 10 days of the motion.

On August 21, 1963, petitioner moved for an extension of time to file arguments. The arguments were eventually filed on August 27, 1963. On September 16, 1963, the CIR *en banc* dismissed the MR because the supporting arguments were "filed out of time." Petitioner appealed, challenging the CIR decision on its merits, while the CIR maintained that the judgment had already become final.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR judgment became final and unappealable due to the late filing of arguments in support of the Motion for Reconsideration.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the judgment had become final and unappealable. While the *pro forma* Motion for Reconsideration was filed on time (August 12), the supporting arguments were filed 15 days later on August 27, exceeding the ten-day reglementary period provided by CIR procedural rules.

The Court cited established jurisprudence (*Pangasinan Employees vs. Martinez* and *Luzon Stevedoring vs. CIR*) stating that where arguments in support of an MR are filed beyond the prescribed period, the motion must be denied, and the decision becomes final and unappealable. Furthermore, the CIR has a standing rule against extending the ten-day period for filing arguments. Petitioner's motion for extension filed on August 21 did not cure this defect, as petitioner failed to verify the court's action on the extension and filed the arguments five days after the deadline. Since the judgment had attained finality, the Supreme Court could no longer review the case on its merits.

Petition denied.
