I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MARIANO OANDASAN**, G.R. No. L-29532, September 28, 1968, 25 SCRA 277, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Mariano Oandasan saw the deceased, Quirino Duldulao, chasing Oandasan's son. When Oandasan approached and asked Duldulao why he was doing so, Duldulao hit Oandasan on the left shoulder with a wooden club. Oandasan drew a knife, but Duldulao clubbed him again, this time on the head. Oandasan then stabbed Duldulao, resulting in the latter's death [1, 2].

Procedurally, a complaint for Homicide was filed in the Municipal Court of Flora. During the preliminary investigation there, Oandasan pleaded "not guilty" [3]. The case was elevated to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cagayan. Upon arraignment in the CFI, Oandasan pleaded "guilty" and presented evidence to prove incomplete self-defense and voluntary surrender [4]. The trial court convicted him of Homicide but refused to appreciate the plea of guilty as a mitigating circumstance due to his previous "not guilty" plea in the municipal court. The court also rejected incomplete self-defense, appreciating only provocation and voluntary surrender [4]. Oandasan appealed the penalty imposed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of a plea of guilty despite having pleaded not guilty during the preliminary investigation in the municipal court.
2. W/N the accused is entitled to the privileged mitigating circumstance of incomplete self-defense.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the plea of not guilty entered in the municipal court during a preliminary investigation is "no plea at all" for the purpose of judgment because that court had no jurisdiction over the crime of Homicide [5]. The proper forum for the plea was the CFI, the court of competent jurisdiction. Since Oandasan pleaded guilty in the CFI upon arraignment and prior to the presentation of evidence, he is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary confession of guilt under Article 13(7) of the Revised Penal Code [6, 7]. The Court distinguished this from cases where the municipal court has jurisdiction, in which case a change of plea on appeal would not mitigate liability [8, 9].

2. **YES.** The Court found that the accused proved unlawful aggression (the victim clubbing the accused) and lack of sufficient provocation. The only element missing to fully exempt him from liability under Article 11(1) was the "reasonable necessity of the means employed" [10]. Thus, the privileged mitigating circumstance of incomplete self-defense exists. Under Article 69 of the Revised Penal Code, this justifies a reduction of the penalty by one or two degrees [11].

**Disposition:** Judgment is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Due to the privileged mitigating circumstance of incomplete self-defense, plus the mitigating circumstances of plea of guilty and voluntary surrender, the penalty is reduced by two degrees to *prision correccional*. The accused is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of four (4) months of *arresto mayor* as minimum, to two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of *prision correccional* as maximum [12].
