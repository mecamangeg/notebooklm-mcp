I. CAPTION
SALVADOR BENEDICTO (deceased), substituted by ROBERTO S. BENEDICTO v. COURT OF APPEALS and VICENTE A. HERAS, G.R. No. L-22733, September 25, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Miriam R. Hedrick, the original owner of a property, sold a portion to Claro M. Recto (predecessor-in-interest of petitioner Benedicto) and retained the remainder, which was eventually acquired by respondent Heras [1-4]. The deed of sale established a perpetual easement of way for vehicles between the two properties, annotated on the titles [5, 6]. In 1941, Heras demolished the building on his property to construct an apartment [7, 8]. In 1946, Benedicto walled off the passageway [9]. In 1955, Heras filed an action to recover the portion and reopen the easement [9, 10]. Benedicto argued the easement was extinguished by non-user and cessation of necessity since Heras' property gained direct access to the street after the 1941 demolition [11]. The trial court and Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Heras, upholding the easement [12].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the easement of right of way was extinguished by non-user or cessation of necessity.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals.

Regarding non-user, the Court held that there was no indubitable proof that the passageway had not been used since 1941 [9]. Even assuming the ten-year prescriptive period under Article 631 of the Civil Code applied, the period had not elapsed because Benedicto only walled the passageway in 1946, and the action was filed in 1955 [9].

Regarding the cessation of necessity and the nature of the easement, the Court ruled that the easement is perpetual in character, having been stipulated "for all time and for all needs" (*para todo el tiempo*) and annotated on all transfer certificates of title [13]. Absent a mutual agreement to extinguish it, its existence must be respected [13]. Furthermore, the fact that an easement by grant may also qualify as an easement of necessity does not detract from its permanency as a property right, which survives the termination of the necessity [14].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed [15].
