I. CAPTION
ARTURO T. UBARRA and ENRIQUE D. JUGOS v. BISCOM EMPLOYEES COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATION, INC., et al., G.R. No. L-25332, October 14, 1968, 25 SCRA 89, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Ubarra (Manager) and Jugos (Rice Section-in-charge) were employees of the Biscom Employees Cooperative Association, Inc. (BECA). On April 30, 1964, the BECA Board of Directors passed Resolution No. 273 indefinitely suspending plaintiffs for alleged anomalies and loss of trust. Following a summary investigation where plaintiffs' counsel was excluded, the Board dismissed them.

Plaintiffs filed a civil action for damages in the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, alleging the charges against them were "false and libelous" and motivated by malice, personal spite, and political rivalry. Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss on two grounds: (1) lack of jurisdiction, arguing plaintiffs should have first appealed to the General Assembly pursuant to Republic Act No. 2023 (Cooperative Laws) and the association's by-laws; and (2) no cause of action, claiming the resolution was a privileged communication under Article 354 of the Revised Penal Code. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the case. Plaintiffs appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court has jurisdiction over the subject matter despite plaintiffs' failure to appeal to the General Assembly.
2. W/N the complaint should be dismissed on the ground that the charges were privileged communication.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the lower court had jurisdiction. Jurisdiction over the subject matter is conferred by law and does not depend on the acts or omissions of the parties. Even assuming RA 2023 and the by-laws required an appeal to the General Assembly, the failure to take such a step would, at best, affect the plaintiffs' cause of action, but not the court's jurisdiction. Furthermore, the Court noted that the relevant provisions of RA 2023 did not clearly cover the legality of the dismissal, and plaintiffs were seeking damages for libelous charges rather than reinstatement.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the dismissal on this ground was improper. The privilege conferred by Article 354 of the Revised Penal Code is qualified, not absolute, and the presumption of good faith is rebuttable. Since the complaint expressly alleged that the charges were motivated by "criminal intent" and "malice"—allegations deemed hypothetically admitted by the defendants' Motion to Dismiss—the defense of privileged communication could not justify dismissing the complaint at the pleading stage.

The Order appealed from is **SET ASIDE**, and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings.
