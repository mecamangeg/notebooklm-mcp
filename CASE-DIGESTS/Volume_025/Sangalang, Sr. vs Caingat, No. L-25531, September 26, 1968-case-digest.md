I. CAPTION
ELENO T. SANGALANG, SR. v. HUGO H. CAINGAT, G.R. No. L-25531, September 26, 1968, 25 SCRA 180, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Eleno T. Sangalang, Sr. and his children were the registered owners of several parcels of land in San Fernando, Pampanga. On September 11, 1963, they executed an agreement with respondent Hugo H. Caingat for the development and sale of the properties as a subdivision, which was annotated on their Transfer Certificates of Title [1]. The agreement stipulated that the Sangalangs had the right to cancel the contract if Caingat failed to comply with its conditions [2].

Claiming Caingat breached the contract, Sangalang, Sr. unilaterally rescinded the agreement via letter on January 25, 1965 [2]. He subsequently filed petitions with the Court of First Instance of Pampanga to cancel the annotations on the titles under Section 112 of Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act). The petitions were initially granted *ex parte* [2]. Caingat filed a motion to set aside the orders, arguing he was denied due process and that a judicial declaration of rescission was necessary in an ordinary civil action. The lower court revoked its earlier orders and denied the petition for cancellation, ruling that Section 112 contemplates only non-controverted cases [3]. Sangalang, Sr. appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the land registration court may cancel the annotation of the agreement under Section 112 of Act No. 496 despite the controversy between the parties regarding the contract's cancellation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. Proceedings under Section 112 of Act No. 496 are summary in nature and are permissible only when the issues presented are "so patently insubstantial as not to be genuine issues" [4]. The Court held that relief under this section can only be granted if there is "unanimity among the parties" or if there is "no adverse claim or serious objection on the part of any party in interest" [4].

In this case, Caingat opposed the cancellation, creating a genuine controversy regarding the rescission of the contract. The Court ruled that such controversial matters arising after the entry of the original decree of registration are "beyond the limited authority of a land registration court" and must be threshed out in an ordinary civil action [4].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, Fernando, and Capistrano concurred. Justices Dizon and Zaldivar did not take part [5].
