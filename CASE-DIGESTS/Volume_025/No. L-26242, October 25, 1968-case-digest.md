I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION AS CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, JAMES Y. NG alias JAMES UY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-26242, October 25, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner James Y. Ng, born in the Philippines, filed a petition for naturalization. On March 14, 1963, the Court of First Instance of Cebu granted the petition. Following the statutory two-year period, Ng filed a motion for the final hearing, and on January 5, 1966, the trial court issued an order authorizing him to take the oath of allegiance. The Republic appealed, raising defects in Ng's qualifications.

Ng did not file a declaration of intention, claiming exemption due to his birth in the Philippines. However, he completed his primary education at Hope Christian High School and elementary instruction at Cebu Chinese High School. Regarding the requirement of a lucrative trade, Ng's original 1959 petition stated an annual income of P1,680, while his 1960 amended petition claimed P3,000. To support this, he presented evidence of employment in a business owned by his father and included commissions, transportation, and representation expenses in his income calculation. Additionally, Ng failed to state his "place or places of residence" in his petition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a declaration of intention.
2. W/N the petitioner possesses a lucrative trade or profession.
3. W/N the failure to state all places of residence is fatal to the petition.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Although born in the Philippines, the petitioner is not exempt from filing a declaration of intention because he failed to prove that the schools he attended were "not limited to any race or nationality," as required by Sections 5 and 6 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 [1]. Furthermore, enrollment in Chinese schools raises the inference that the applicant is subject to disqualification for failing to evince "a sincere desire to embrace our customs, traditions and ideals" [2].

2. **NO.** A business establishment belonging to the petitioner's own father cannot be relied upon to prove lucrative income [3]. Moreover, commissions, transportation, and representation expenses are considered "contingent, speculative, indefinite, unsteady and precarious in nature" and cannot be included in determining whether a trade is lucrative [4]. The Court emphasized that financial qualifications are determined as of the date of the filing of the petition, not by subsequent increases in income [4].

3. **YES.** The petitioner's failure to state his "place or places of residence" in the petition constitutes a violation of Section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 [5, 6]. Such omission is fatal to the application for naturalization [6].

**Order reversed.**
