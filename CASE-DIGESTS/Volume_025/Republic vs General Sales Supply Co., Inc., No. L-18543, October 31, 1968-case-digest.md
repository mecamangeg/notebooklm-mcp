I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GENERAL SALES SUPPLY CO., INC., GERARDO SAMSON, and RESTITUTO SAMSON, G.R. No. L-18543, October 31, 1968, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
General Sales Supply Co., Inc. filed income tax returns for the years 1946 to 1949. Following a Senate investigation, a Bureau of Internal Revenue examiner discovered that the corporation had padded its purchases and expenses. On February 28, 1951, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued a deficiency assessment. After requests for reinvestigation, a modified assessment for P79,379.69 was issued in 1955. The corporation protested, arguing that the right to assess and collect had prescribed under Section 51(d) of the Tax Code. The Commissioner maintained that Section 332(a) applied due to fraud.

On February 27, 1959, the Republic filed a suit for collection in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The corporation moved to dismiss on the ground of prescription, which was denied. During the trial, defense counsel failed to appear twice, leading the court to consider the case submitted for decision without defense evidence. The CFI ruled in favor of the Republic. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the government's action to collect the deficiency income taxes has prescribed.
2. W/N the defendants were deprived of their day in court.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the three-year prescriptive period in Section 51(d) of the Internal Revenue Code applies only to the summary collection of taxes by distraint and levy, not to judicial actions [1, 2]. Since the collection here was by judicial action and involved fraudulent returns (padded expenses), Section 332(a) of the Tax Code applies [2, 3]. This section allows proceedings to be commenced within 10 years from the "discovery of the falsity, fraud or omission" [4]. The fraud was discovered on February 3, 1951, and the complaint was filed on February 27, 1959, well within the 10-year period [5]. Furthermore, the Court noted that the assessment became final and collectible because the defendants failed to appeal the disputed assessment to the Court of Tax Appeals, which has exclusive jurisdiction over such matters [6].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that if a party's absence during a hearing is due to their own fault, they cannot claim deprivation of their day in court [7]. The record showed that defense counsel failed to appear at the scheduled hearing twice, despite a postponement granted for the first absence [8]. A trial may proceed without the presence of a defendant who has answered but fails to appear [7].

The judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED.
