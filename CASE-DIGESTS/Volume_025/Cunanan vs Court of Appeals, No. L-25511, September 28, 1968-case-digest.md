I. CAPTION
PATRICIO S. CUNANAN v. COURT OF APPEALS and BASARAN (Moro), G.R. No. L-25511, September 28, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On February 14, 1948, petitioner Patricio Cunanan filed a forcible entry case against respondent Basaran (Moro) in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Mati, Davao [1]. The parties, assisted by counsel, entered into a compromise agreement on March 20, 1948, dividing the land between them and acknowledging each other's ownership and possession of their respective portions [1-3]. The JP Court approved the agreement and enjoined compliance [4].

Both parties complied until mid-1951, when Basaran allegedly encroached on Cunanan's portion [4]. On August 26, 1953, Cunanan filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao to enforce the 1948 decision and recover possession [4]. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling the compromise void because it adjudicated ownership—a matter beyond the JP Court's jurisdiction—and held that the action to enforce the judgment was improper [5]. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the dismissal, declaring the JP decision "null and void" for lack of authority to pass upon title and because the compromise lacked the Provincial Governor's approval required for contracts with non-Christians under the Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the compromise agreement approved by the Justice of the Peace is void for adjudicating ownership.
2. W/N the compromise agreement involving a non-Christian is void for lack of the Provincial Governor's approval under the Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu.
3. W/N the petitioner is entitled to recover possession through the action filed in the CFI.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The approval of the compromise agreement by the JP Court did not amount to an adjudication of title. Ownership was mentioned in the agreement merely as a basis for the right of possession acknowledged by the parties [7]. The right of possession was the only question sought to be settled and actually decided by the JP Court, which falls within its jurisdiction [7].

2. **NO.** Sections 145 and 146 of the Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu, which require executive approval for contracts with non-Christians, contemplate "ordinary contracts," not agreements for the settlement of judicial proceedings approved by a court [8, 9]. The purpose of these provisions—to protect non-Christians from misunderstanding contracts—is not present in judicial compromises where parties are assisted by counsel and subject to judicial scrutiny [8, 9]. Administrative approval cannot be given greater weight than judicial approval [10, 11].

3. **YES.** While the motion for execution of the 1948 decision was technically barred (as the decision had already been executed and complied with for years), the complaint filed in the CFI alleged usurpation of property for over a year [12, 13]. Therefore, the suit is proper as an *accion publiciana*, and the plaintiff is entitled to a determination of the issues of fact regarding the alleged encroachment [13, 14].

The decision of the Court of Appeals and the Court of First Instance are REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED to the court of origin for further proceedings [13].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, Fernando, and Capistrano concurred. Justices Dizon and Zaldivar did not take part [15].
