I. CAPTION
ISIDORO GEVEROLA v. HON. VICENTE N. CUSI, JR. and THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-25031, September 25, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Isidoro Geverola, accused of Malversation through Falsification of Public Documents, was out on bail with trial scheduled for August 23, 1965 [1, 2]. On the hearing date, his counsel moved for postponement because Geverola was suffering from influenza with chronic cough and could not travel the 125 kilometers from his residence in Malita to the court in Davao City [2, 3]. The motion was supported by a sworn medical certificate and met with no objection from the fiscal [3]. Without resolving the motion, respondent Judge Cusi ordered the immediate arrest of the accused and the confiscation of his bail, stating he would hear the motion only if the doctor testified [4, 5]. Geverola's motion for reconsideration was denied, with the judge reasoning that the arrest was valid since the accused failed to appear and the postponement motion had not yet been acted upon [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial judge committed grave abuse of discretion in ordering the accused's arrest and bond confiscation without resolving the motion for postponement.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while the grant of postponement is discretionary, such discretion must be sound and reasonable, not arbitrary or capricious [7]. Considering this was the first postponement requested by the accused, the illness was seemingly serious, the distance was significant, and the fiscal did not object, the trial court should have exercised prudence and given the defense an opportunity to present the doctor rather than jeopardizing the accused's rights [8].

Furthermore, procedural due process necessitates a prior resolution of a motion for postponement to afford the movant the opportunity to seek proper legal remedies (*Semira v. Enriquez*) [9, 10]. Proceeding with the order of arrest and confiscation of bail without ruling on the pending motion constitutes gross abuse of discretion (*People v. Labra*) [11, 12]. The petition is granted, and the orders complained of are set aside [12].
