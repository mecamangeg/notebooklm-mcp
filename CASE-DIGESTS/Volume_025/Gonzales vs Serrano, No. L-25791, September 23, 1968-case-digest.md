I. CAPTION
CARLOS R. GONZALES v. EULOGIO SERRANO, in his capacity as City Fiscal of Manila, and LIBRADA ASIS, G.R. No. L-25791, September 23, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On October 27, 1964, Carlos R. Gonzales (petitioner) sold plastic flowers to Librada Asis (respondent) for P10,172. Asis paid P2,000 in cash and issued a check for the balance of P8,172 [1, 2]. The next day, Asis requested Gonzales not to deposit the check due to insufficient funds. Gonzales agreed and did not deposit the check [1, 3]. On November 17, 1964, Asis made a partial payment of P5,556, which Gonzales accepted, leaving a balance of P2,612 [1, 4].

Gonzales filed a complaint for estafa against Asis. The City Fiscal of Manila (Serrano) dismissed the charge, ruling that the obligation was civil in nature because the transaction had been novated from a cash transaction to a sale on credit [4, 5]. The Secretary of Justice upheld the Fiscal’s decision [5]. Gonzales then filed a petition for mandamus with the Court of First Instance of Manila to compel the Fiscal to file the information. The trial court dismissed the petition, ruling that the Fiscal’s duty involves discretion and that the parties' subsequent acts (delaying check deposit and accepting partial payment) converted the relation into an ordinary creditor-debtor situation [6-8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the City Fiscal may be compelled by mandamus to file an information for estafa against the respondent.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the mandamus petition. The Court held that the City Fiscal is entitled to use his judgment and a measure of discretion in appreciating the evidence presented to him. Consequently, the exercise of such judgment and discretion cannot be controlled by mandamus [9, 10].

The Court agreed with the Fiscal’s finding that even if the original agreement was a C.O.D. sale, it was novated into a sale on credit by the subsequent acts of the parties—specifically, Gonzales agreeing not to deposit the check and accepting partial payment on a later date [11, 12]. Citing *People v. Nery*, the Court noted that novation prior to the filing of the criminal information may convert the relation between the parties into an ordinary creditor-debtor relation, effectively preventing criminal liability [11, 12]. Furthermore, damage, an essential element of estafa, was not sufficiently established as Asis was willing to return the unsold goods [10].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [13].
