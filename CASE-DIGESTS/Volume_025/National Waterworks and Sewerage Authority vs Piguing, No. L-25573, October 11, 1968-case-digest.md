I. CAPTION
NATIONAL WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY v. HON. MINERVA I. PIGUING, THE MUNICIPALITY OF SAN FERNANDO, THE CITY OF ANGELES, THE MUNICIPALITY OF GUAGUA, and THE MUNICIPALITY OF MACABEBE, G.R. No. L-25573, October 11, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
In 1958, petitioner National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) took over the possession, operation, and control of the waterworks systems of the respondent municipal corporations (San Fernando, Guagua, Macabebe, and Angeles City) pursuant to Republic Act No. 1383, without paying compensation [1]. On September 30, 1961, the respondents filed a civil case in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga to recover their systems and claimed damages [1].

On December 29, 1965, respondent Judge Minerva I. Piguing issued a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction restraining NAWASA from administering the systems, citing Supreme Court rulings declaring R.A. 1383 unconstitutional for effecting a taking without just compensation [2, 3]. On January 14, 1966, the Judge suspended the writ for 72 hours to allow NAWASA to deposit the admitted net book value of the properties, as previously agreed upon during pre-trial; otherwise, the writ would be implemented [4]. NAWASA filed a petition for certiorari, alleging grave abuse of discretion, arguing that the writ upset the status quo and that the deposit requirement was unreasonable [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction and the order requiring the deposit of the book value of the properties.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition and held that the respondent Judge did not commit grave abuse of discretion or exceed her jurisdiction [6].

The Court found the petition devoid of merit because: (1) the proprietary rights of the respondent municipal corporations and their right to compensation were admitted; (2) NAWASA took the properties without payment; and (3) NAWASA was aware that R.A. 1383 had been declared unconstitutional insofar as it authorized the taking of local waterworks systems without effective payment of just compensation, as ruled in *City of Baguio v. NAWASA* (106 Phil. 144) and subsequent cases [7]. Furthermore, the amounts required to be deposited were the admitted book values of the properties, and NAWASA’s counsel had previously expressed readiness to make such a deposit [7].

The petition is dismissed and the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Supreme Court is dissolved [6].
