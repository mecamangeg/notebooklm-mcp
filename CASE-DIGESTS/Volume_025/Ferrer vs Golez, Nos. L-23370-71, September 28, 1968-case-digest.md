I. CAPTION
TERESA FERRER, NICOLASA FERRER, BERNARDO FERRER, and PATERNO BANDORIO v. HON. CESARIO C. GOLEZ, et al., G.R. Nos. L-23370-71, September 28, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Rufino Ferrer and his wife, Leoncia Leonor, were plaintiffs in two consolidated civil cases regarding the annulment of sales and recovery of land. The trial court dismissed their complaints. The plaintiffs perfected their appeal on January 3, 1964. However, Rufino Ferrer died in December 1963. On April 27, 1964, the widow Leoncia Leonor moved to dismiss the appeal, which respondent Judge Golez granted on May 6, 1964.

Petitioner Paterno Bandorio, claiming to be the attorney-in-fact for the spouses, filed an unverified motion to set aside the dismissal order on May 20, 1964, but failed to serve notice to the adverse party. Judge Golez declined to act on it. Subsequently, Bandorio and Rufino’s sisters (Teresa and Nicolasa Ferrer) filed motions for reconsideration, claiming to be heirs. The Judge dismissed these motions, ruling that the movants were strangers to the case as they had not properly intervened or substituted the deceased.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N an unverified motion for reconsideration filed without notice to the adverse party suspends the period of appeal.
2. W/N the petitioners (Bandorio and the Ferrer sisters) had legal standing to contest the dismissal of the appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that an unverified motion for reconsideration to set aside a trial court's order, where no notice thereof has been served by the movant upon the attorney of record of the adverse party, is a motion *pro forma*. As such, it does not suspend the running of the period of appeal from the order of dismissal [1-3].

2. **NO.** Regarding Bandorio, his power of attorney lapsed upon the death of the principal, Rufino Ferrer. With respect to the surviving principal, Leoncia Leonor, the agency was deemed cancelled when she personally took over the case to dismiss the appeal. Regarding the Ferrer sisters, they never asked the court to allow them to intervene or substitute the deceased Rufino Ferrer. Therefore, the respondent judge correctly pronounced them strangers to the case [4, 5].

The writs prayed for are denied and the petition is dismissed [6, 7].
