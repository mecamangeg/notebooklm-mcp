I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RAMON NAVARRA AND VIRGILIO CRUZ, G.R. No. L-25607, October 14, 1968, 25 SCRA 491, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On December 11, 1961, in Bacolod City, accused police officers Ramon Navarra and Virgilio Cruz picked up the victim, Tomas Martir, after receiving a complaint that Martir had manhandled a civilian. After verifying that no official complaint was recorded at headquarters, they drove Martir toward his home but stopped at the Florida Hotel. Martir attempted to run away. Navarra ordered a watchman to catch him; the watchman cornered Martir and pushed him against a wall. While Martir was defenseless, intoxicated, and held at bay, Navarra shot him twice, followed by a shot from Cruz, and two more shots from Navarra, killing him [1-3]. The accused claimed self-defense, alleging Martir grabbed Cruz’s revolver and aimed it at Navarra, forcing Navarra to shoot [4]. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental rejected this version and convicted them of Murder [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused acted in valid self-defense.
2. W/N the killing was qualified by abuse of superior strength.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The plea of self-defense failed because the physical evidence contradicted the defense's version of events. Ballistic findings showed the victim was hit by bullets from both Navarra's and Cruz's service revolvers, refuting Cruz's claim that he never fired [6]. Furthermore, the Court found it improbable that the victim, who was drunk, could have successfully wrested a gun from a police officer and aimed it at another. Citing *People v. Ansoyon*, the Court reiterated that an accused claiming self-defense must rely on the strength of their own evidence, not on the weakness of the prosecution's [6].

2. **YES.** The crime was Murder qualified by abuse of superior strength under Article 14, Paragraph 15 of the Revised Penal Code. The victim was unarmed, intoxicated, and much smaller than Navarra [7]. The accused were two fully armed police officers who unexpectedly attacked the victim after he had already been pushed against a wall by a third party. They took advantage of their combined strength and weaponry against a defenseless man to consummate the offense [7].

The judgment of the lower court sentencing the accused to *reclusión perpetua* and ordering them to indemnify the heirs is AFFIRMED [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Reyes, J.B.L., J., concurred in the result [8].
