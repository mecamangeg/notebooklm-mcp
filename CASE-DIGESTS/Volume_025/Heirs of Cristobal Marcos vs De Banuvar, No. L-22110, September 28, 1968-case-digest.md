I. CAPTION
HEIRS OF CRISTOBAL MARCOS, Headed by ANTONIO MARCOS, ET AL. v. MARIA DE ERQUIAGA DE BANUVAR, GREGORIO PONDAL and the HON. MARIANO V. BENEDICTO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Masbate, G.R. No. L-22110, September 28, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On March 24, 1938, the Court of First Instance of Masbate rendered a decision in a land registration case confirming the title of La Urbana, Inc. over certain lots. A copy of the decision was received by the oppositor's counsel, who noted "Con mi excepcion" (with my exception) on the copy. No formal appeal was perfected. Years later, Santiago de Erquiaga, successor-in-interest of La Urbana, filed for the reconstitution of the 1938 decision. During the proceedings, respondent Maria de Erquiaga de Banuvar acquired the land and substituted Santiago.

The petitioners, Heirs of Cristobal Marcos, opposed the reconstitution, claiming they had been in actual possession of the land since time immemorial. The trial court granted the reconstitution in 1962. The petitioners attempted to appeal this order, but it was dismissed for failure to post a bond. Subsequently, in 1963, the trial court ordered the issuance of a decree of registration and a writ of possession in favor of De Banuvar. The petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that the 1938 decision never became final due to the "exception" noted, that the decree was void for lack of technical descriptions, and that the judgment could no longer be enforced due to the lapse of more than 10 years (statute of limitations).

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 1938 decision became final and executory despite the notation "Con mi excepcion."
2. W/N the execution of the 1938 decision is barred by the statute of limitations or laches given the lapse of more than 10 years.
3. W/N the writ of possession was properly issued against the petitioners.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The decision of March 24, 1938, had long become final and executory as no appeal was taken. The mere notation "Con mi excepcion" at the foot of the decision did not have the effect of perfecting an appeal [1]. A judgment in a land registration case becomes final upon the expiration of thirty days from the date the party appealing receives notice of the decision (Sec. 26, Act 2347) [1].

2. **NO.** The provision in Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court regarding the enforcement of judgments by motion (within 5 years) or action (within 10 years) refers to civil actions and is not applicable to special proceedings like land registration cases [2], [3]. In *Sta. Ana v. Menla*, the Court held that the judgment of a land registration court is merely declaratory and does not need to be enforced against the adverse party [3], [4]. There is nothing in the law that limits the period within which the court may order or issue a decree, and the issuance of such decree is a ministerial duty of the judge and the Land Registration Commission [5], [4].

3. **YES.** A writ of possession may be issued not only against the original oppositors but also against any person unlawfully and adversely occupying the land at any time before and up to the issuance of the final decree [6]. The exception cited by petitioners—where a writ will not issue against persons in possession for at least 10 years—applies only when possession commenced *after* the issuance of the final decree [7], [8]. Here, petitioners admitted their possession arose prior to or during the registration proceedings and before the issuance of the decree in 1963 [6].

Petition denied.
