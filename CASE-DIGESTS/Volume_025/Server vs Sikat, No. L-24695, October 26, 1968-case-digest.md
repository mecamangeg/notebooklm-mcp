**I. CAPTION**
B. J. SERVER v. RICARDO SIKAT, G.R. No. L-24695, October 26, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
On January 16, 1945, Ricardo Sikat obtained a loan of P120,000.00 in Japanese Occupation money from B. J. Server, secured by a mortgage on two parcels of land. They executed a promissory note stating Sikat would pay P6,000.00 in legal Philippine currency "within two (2) years counted from and after the termination of the hostilities" between the US and Japan. After the war, Server demanded payment of the P6,000.00. Sikat refused, claiming the amount should be adjusted based on the value of the Japanese notes.

Server filed a suit for collection and foreclosure in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI ruled in favor of Server, ordering Sikat to pay the full P6,000.00, rejecting Sikat's claim of a verbal agreement allowing payment during the occupation. Sikat appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which reversed the CFI decision. The CA found that the parties had a verbal agreement that the loan could be paid during the occupation and ordered the revaluation of the obligation to P1,000.00 under the Ballantyne schedule. Server petitioned the Supreme Court for review.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the loan obligation incurred in Japanese war notes should be revalued using the Ballantyne schedule of comparative values.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision. The Court upheld the CA's factual finding that there was a contemporaneous oral agreement allowing Sikat to pay the loan during the Japanese occupation. Furthermore, the Court reasoned that even without the oral agreement, the stipulation in the promissory note that payment be made "**within** two (2) years counted from and after the termination of hostilities" implied that the debtor had the right to pay at any time *before* the end of that period, including the remaining days of the occupation.

Because the debtor had the privilege to repay the loan in Japanese fiat money when it was legal currency, the indebtedness must be revalued to avoid making the debtor pay a penalty for the delay. Citing *Gomez v. Tabia* and related jurisprudence, the Court held that an obligation payable during the occupation shall be revalued on the basis of the relative value of the Japanese military notes in Philippine currency at the date the obligation was payable (Ballantyne schedule).

The petition is denied and the decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
