I. CAPTION
CEBU PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY, petitioner, vs. COLLECTOR (NOW COMMISSIONER) OF INTERNAL REVENUE, respondent., G.R. No. L-20563, October 29, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cebu Portland Cement Company manufactured and sold APO Portland cement. Prior to the effectivity of Republic Act No. 1299 on June 16, 1955, Petitioner paid the 7% percentage (sales) tax on its gross sales under Section 186 of the National Internal Revenue Code, inclusive of the cost of bag containers and gypsum [1, 2]. RA 1299 amended Section 246 of the Tax Code, clarifying the definitions of "minerals" and "mineral products." Following this amendment, Petitioner stopped paying sales tax, contending that cement was a "mineral product" exempt from sales tax, and instead paid *ad valorem* tax [2, 3].

Petitioner filed claims for the refund of sales taxes paid from November 1, 1954 to March 1955, and *ad valorem* taxes paid from April 1955 to September 1956 [1, 4]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) dismissed the petition, ruling that: (1) RA 1299 does not apply retroactively; (2) costs of bags and gypsum were not deductible; (3) Petitioner was not the proper party to claim a refund for taxes billed to customers; and (4) the action had prescribed [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Republic Act No. 1299 applies retroactively to exempt cement from sales tax prior to its enactment.
2. W/N the cost of gypsum and bag containers is deductible from the gross selling price for sales tax computation.
3. W/N Petitioner is the proper party to claim a refund for taxes passed on to customers.
4. W/N the defense of prescription was waived and whether the claim has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Statutes operate prospectively only and never retroactively unless legislative intent to the contrary is manifest [6]. The use of the word "shall" in RA 1299 indicates the law was intended to be effective *in futuro*, and the explanatory notes reveal no intent to unsettle previously consummated transactions [6, 7]. Therefore, prior to the amendment, cement was a manufactured product subject to percentage tax under Section 186 and was not exempt as a mineral product [8].

2. **YES.** The gypsum and bag containers are deductible from the gross selling price in computing the 7% compensating tax [9]. Section 186 allows the deduction of the total cost of materials likewise subject to tax. It is inferred that the bags were bought from others who paid the tax, and gypsum is an imported component subject to compensating tax (equivalent to sales tax) [9].

3. **YES.** The tax under Section 186 is imposed on the manufacturer or producer, not the purchaser [10]. Even if the tax burden is shifted to the customer, the legal obligation remains with the manufacturer. Thus, Petitioner is the proper party to claim the refund, consistent with the ruling in *Philippine Acetylene Co., Inc. v. CIR* [11-13].

4. **YES (as to waiver) and PARTIAL YES (as to period).** The defense of prescription was not waived by the failure to raise it in the original answer because the amended answer, which pleaded prescription, superseded the original [14]. Under Section 306 of the Tax Code, suits must be filed within two years of payment [15].
   *   *Sales Tax:* The suit was filed on January 24, 1957. Counting back two years, taxes paid after January 25, 1955 are not prescribed and may be refunded [16].
   *   *Ad Valorem Tax:* This claim was added in the amended petition on October 24, 1959. Counting back two years, only taxes paid after October 25, 1957 could be recovered. Since the *ad valorem* taxes were paid in 1955–1956, this claim is barred by prescription [16].

**Decision affirmed with modification.**
