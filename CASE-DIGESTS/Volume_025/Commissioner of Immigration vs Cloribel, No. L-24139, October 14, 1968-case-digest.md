I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION v. HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL, MERCEDES TOBIANO CO, JOSE TOBIANO and JUSTO TOBIANO, G.R. No. L-24139, October 14, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
The Commissioner of Immigration filed a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction against Judge Gaudencio Cloribel of the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The Judge had issued an order releasing respondents Jose and Justo Tobiano on bail while their habeas corpus proceeding was pending. The Commissioner argued that the order constituted a grave abuse of discretion, citing *Bengzon v. Ocampo* and related cases, which established that the power to release aliens on bail in deportation cases is vested in the Bureau of Immigration, not the Courts of First Instance [1, 2].

The Supreme Court initially issued a preliminary injunction on February 10, 1965, stopping the release [3]. However, during the pendency of the case, the respondents filed urgent petitions for bail, citing the length of their detention and the inhumane, unsanitary conditions at the Engineering Island detention center [4, 5]. The Solicitor General eventually manifested that he would leave the matter of bail to the sound discretion of the Supreme Court [6]. Consequently, on August 30, 1965, the Court issued a Resolution amending its previous injunction to explicitly permit the respondent Judge to grant bail to the Tobianos subject to certain conditions [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for certiorari challenging the trial court's jurisdiction to grant bail has become moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the petition was moot and academic. By virtue of the Court's Resolution dated August 30, 1965, which amended the preliminary injunction to permit the respondent Judge to grant bail to the private respondents, the contentious issue regarding the release on bail was effectively resolved for this specific case [8, 9].

The Court acknowledged that the legal question raised—whether a Court of First Instance has the power to grant bail in exclusion or deportation cases—is significant and might require a re-examination of the doctrine laid down in *Bengzon v. Ocampo* [2, 9]. However, since the release had already been authorized by the Court's interim resolution, the Court declined to rule on the substantive jurisdictional issue, preferring to wait for a "more propitious occasion" where the issue remains adversarial [9].

Petition dismissed [10].
