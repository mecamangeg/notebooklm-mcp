I. CAPTION
LINKOD JUANE, RUPERTO SUÑGA and FLORA ANTONIO v. HON. GREGORIO N. GARCIA, et al., G.R. No. L-21115, October 29, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Manotok Realty, Inc. filed ejectment suits against petitioners (tenants) in the Municipal Court of Manila. In July 1960, Judge Garcia issued orders suspending the proceedings due to pending expropriation cases under Republic Act No. 1162, but directed petitioners to pay rentals in arrears and current rentals. Petitioners attempted to appeal these orders, but the appeals were disallowed for being interlocutory. Subsequently, on December 12 and 18, 1961, the Municipal Court heard the ejectment cases on the merits. Notices of trial were sent to the address of record of petitioners' counsel, Atty. Ruperto Suñga, but were returned unserved because the room was vacant and locked; counsel had moved without informing the court. Consequently, petitioners failed to appear, and judgments were rendered ordering them to vacate. Petitioners filed various petitions for certiorari and mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) and the Court of Appeals (CA), which were dismissed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Municipal Court orders of July 1960 (suspending proceedings and fixing rentals) were final and appealable.
2. W/N the judgments rendered against petitioners were void for lack of due process due to non-service of trial notices.
3. W/N the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari against the Municipal Court.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The orders were clearly interlocutory. The Court held that an order is final only if it terminates the action or vests a right, leaving nothing more to be done. Here, the suspension of proceedings "connotes the idea of work unfinished" and did not completely dispose of the controversy [1]. Since the orders were interlocutory, no appeal lies therefrom [1].

2. **NO.** The lack of actual notice was caused by the negligence of petitioners' counsel. The notices were sent to the counsel's address of record. It is the inescapable duty of a lawyer to inform the court of any change of address [2]. The Court applied the rule that a client is bound by their counsel's negligence [3]. Petitioners were given the opportunity to be heard but lost it due to this negligence; thus, there was no denial of due process [4].

3. **NO.** The Court of Appeals may only issue writs of certiorari in aid of its appellate jurisdiction [4]. Since ejectment cases decided by the Municipal Court are appealable to the Court of First Instance and not to the Court of Appeals, the CA lacked jurisdiction to entertain the petition [4].

The petition is **DISMISSED** and the writ of preliminary injunction is dissolved [5].
