I. CAPTION
NATIONAL WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY v. KAISAHAN AT KAPATIRAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA AT KAWANI NG NAWASA (PAFLU) and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-25328, October 11, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On December 1, 1964, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) issued an order requiring the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) to pay a cost of living allowance to employees of the Wells and Springs Unit stationed in Manila and suburbs, effective February 1961 [1, 2]. The order expressly enjoined the parties from altering or modifying the decision without court resolution [3]. After the order became final, the respondent Union filed a motion for execution [4]. NAWASA opposed, alleging that an agreement signed on July 1, 1965, which provided for the payment of approximately P5 million in obligations in five yearly installments, included the cost of living allowance [4]. The CIR granted the execution, finding that the Union President did not agree to include the allowance in the deferred payment and that the previous order prohibited out-of-court modifications [5]. NAWASA appealed, insisting the agreement modified the obligation [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the July 1, 1965 agreement deferred the payment of the cost of living allowance.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR order, ruling that the lower court's conclusion was a finding of fact supported by substantial evidence and therefore not subject to review [7, 8]. The Court sustained the CIR's finding that the Union did not agree to defer the allowance, noting that the motion for execution was pending when the alleged agreement was signed yet was not mentioned therein [5, 9]. Furthermore, the Court held that "it is only natural and logical that payment of the cost of living allowance be not deferred, since the right to live and the increase in the cost of living is not subject to deferment by agreement between the parties" [8].

Decision affirmed; writ of preliminary injunction dissolved [10].
