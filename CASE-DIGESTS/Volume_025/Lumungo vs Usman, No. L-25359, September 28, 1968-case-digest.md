I. CAPTION
ARADA LUMUNGO, JUHURI, DAWA, ET AL. v. ASAAD USMAN, JOSE ANGELES and DOMINGA USMAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25359, September 28, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Datu Idiris Amilhussin, the original owner of registered land in Sulu, agreed to sell five lots to Dominga Usman (wife of Justice of the Peace Asaad Usman) to fund his defense against a treason charge. The Usmans took possession but only paid a fraction of the price. In 1951, the parties mutually agreed to call off the deal, and Datu Idiris promised to return the money received. Despite this, Dominga Usman sold three of the lots to her nephew, Jose Angeles, for P1,000.00. Angeles took possession and planted coconut trees.

Subsequently, Datu Idiris filed a civil case against Asaad Usman, who judicially disclaimed any ownership or interest in the land. Datu Idiris then sold the lots to the petitioners (Lumungo, et al.), who verified the clear titles and registered the sale. Petitioners filed an action to recover possession. The Trial Court declared petitioners the lawful owners but ordered them to reimburse Jose Angeles P4,500.00 for the coconut trees. The Court of Appeals affirmed the ownership and the reimbursement but reduced the amount to P2,500.00 on the basis of equity, despite finding that Angeles was a purchaser in bad faith. Petitioners appealed the award of indemnity.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a builder/planter in bad faith is entitled to reimbursement for improvements (coconut trees) made on the land of another.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court deleted the award of indemnity. The Court affirmed the factual finding that Jose Angeles was a builder in bad faith. As a close relative of the Usmans and a law student, he was aware of the public controversy and legal disputes involving the property between his uncle and the original owner. Being aware of the flaw in his title, he cannot claim good faith.

Under **Article 449 of the Civil Code**, "He who builds, plants or sows in bad faith on the land of another, **loses** what is built, planted or sown **without** right to indemnity." The Court distinguished improvements from "necessary expenses of preservation" (recoverable under Arts. 452 and 546), ruling that coconut trees fall under the former. The Court held that the lower courts' application of "equity" cannot prevail over the express statutory provision of Article 449, and further noted that "he who seeks equity must come with clean hands."

Petition granted; decision modified to eliminate the indemnity award.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
