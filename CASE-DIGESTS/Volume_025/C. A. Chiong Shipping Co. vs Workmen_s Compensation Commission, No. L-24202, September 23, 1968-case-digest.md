I. CAPTION
C. A. CHIONG SHIPPING CO. & C. A. CHIONG v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and MARIA SALVERON VDA. DE MADULA, G.R. No. L-24202, September 23, 1968, Dizon, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Joaquin Madula was employed by petitioners as Chief Engineer since 1954. Although initially found physically fit, he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis in 1957 and advised to avoid heavy work [3, 4]. He continued working until his condition worsened, leading to his death on August 8, 1959 [4]. His widow and children filed a claim for compensation, which the petitioners controverted, arguing that Madula’s duties were light as he mostly stayed on deck while his assistants worked in the hot engine room [4, 5]. The Hearing Officer dismissed the claim, finding the illness was neither caused nor aggravated by his work [6]. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) *en banc* reversed this decision, ruling that the employment aggravated the illness [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the deceased employee's pulmonary tuberculosis was aggravated by the nature and conditions of his employment. [6]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the WCC's findings. The Court held that even if the deceased's duties did not require extraordinary physical effort, the nature of sea travel—involving continuous jarring and rough seas—aggravated his condition [5]. A person afflicted with advanced pulmonary tuberculosis requires complete rest; thus, performing even normal work activities accelerates the disease [7]. Under the **Workmen's Compensation Law**, employment need not be the sole cause of the illness to be compensable; it is sufficient if the employment contributed, even in a small way, to the worsening of the disease [7]. Furthermore, any doubt regarding the aggravation of the illness by employment must be resolved in favor of the claimant [8].

The decision appealed from is affirmed. [9]
