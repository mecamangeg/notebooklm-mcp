I. CAPTION
DY CHUN, ET AL. v. HON. JOSE M. MENDOZA AND VICENTE MIRANDA, G.R. No. L-25461, October 4, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Vicente Miranda, administrator of the Intestate Estate of Hilarion Dydongco, filed a civil case against petitioners (Dy Chun, et al.) alleging they had taken over the deceased's businesses and assets while he was in China [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance of Cebu, presided by respondent Judge Mendoza, rendered a decision ordering petitioners to deliver the properties to the estate and to render a "full, accurate and complete accounting" of all fruits and proceeds from 1935 to the present [3, 4].

Petitioners filed a notice of appeal, but Judge Mendoza issued an order declaring the appeal was not perfected on time and that the decision had become final and executory [5]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus to annul said order and compel the Judge to give due course to their appeal [6]. During the proceedings, the Supreme Court examined the nature of the lower court's decision to determine if it was appealable [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the decision of the lower court ordering the delivery of property and the rendering of an accounting is a final and appealable judgment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the decision is **interlocutory** in character and thus not appealable. The Court explained that a decision which orders a party to render a "full, accurate and complete accounting" does not dispose of the action in its entirety and leaves something to be done to complete the relief sought [8].

Citing *Fuentebella v. Carrascoso*, *Salazar v. Torres*, and *Zaldarriaga v. Enriquez*, the Court held that such a decision is not appealable until after the adjudications necessary for the completion of said relief (the accounting) have been made [8]. Petitioners' counsel conceded that the appeal was taken prematurely [8].

Petition dismissed; writ denied [9].
