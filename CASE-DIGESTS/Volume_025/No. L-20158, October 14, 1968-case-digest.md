I. CAPTION
CANDELARIO ALMENDRAS, TIMOTEO T. OMAY, ET AL. v. AMADO DEL ROSARIO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20158, October 14, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On July 29, 1968, the Supreme Court promulgated a decision reversing the lower court's ruling insofar as it declared the City Mayor of Cebu vested with the power to appoint officers and employees of the Osmeña Waterworks System. The Court ruled the Mayor lacked such authority. However, the decision affirmed the lower court's order for the City Treasurer and City Auditor to pay the salaries of petitioners who had rendered service. The City Treasurer of Cebu filed a motion for clarificatory judgment, claiming the decision was ambiguous and difficult to comply with regarding the payment of salaries for the employees whose appointments were effectively nullified by the High Court's ruling [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the employees appointed by the unauthorized City Mayor are entitled to salaries for services rendered.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court clarified that while the City Mayor of Cebu had no authority to appoint the officers and employees of the Osmeña Waterworks System, the employees appointed by him who had **actually rendered service** are entitled to payment of their respective salaries. This entitlement covers the period from the date of their appointment by said Mayor up to the **finality** of the Supreme Court's decision. The decision clarifies that its effect is to nullify the appointments upon finality, without prejudice to the employees' re-appointment by the competent authority immediately thereafter [2, 3].

The decision is CLARIFIED.
