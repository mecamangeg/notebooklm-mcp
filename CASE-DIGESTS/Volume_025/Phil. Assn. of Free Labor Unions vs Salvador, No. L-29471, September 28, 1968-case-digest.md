I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE ASSOCIATION OF FREE LABOR UNIONS (PAFLU) v. SALVADOR and SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, G.R. Nos. L-29471 and L-29487, September 28, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner PAFLU and respondent Social Security System (SSS) were parties to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) effective from July 1, 1966 to June 30, 1969. This CBA was adopted as a formal award by the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) on August 5, 1966, in a pending case (Case No. 46-IPA) resulting from a presidential certification in 1963. On August 29, 1968, SSS filed an urgent petition with the CIR seeking an interpretation of Article 23 of the CBA due to a controversy. Respondent Judge Salvador issued an order enjoining the Union from striking and Management from locking out employees to maintain the *status quo*. PAFLU failed to comply, believing the Judge lacked jurisdiction absent a new presidential certification. Consequently, Judge Salvador issued orders directing the lifting of pickets and a return to work. The CIR *en banc* dismissed PAFLU's motion for reconsideration for being filed out of time. PAFLU filed these petitions for certiorari and prohibition challenging the jurisdiction of the CIR.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR Judge had jurisdiction to act on the petition to interpret the CBA award without a new presidential certification.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that a new presidential certification was not necessary. The 1963 certification, which resulted in the 1966 award (the CBA), sufficed to vest jurisdiction on the CIR. Under **Sections 17 and 18 of Commonwealth Act No. 103** (Court of Industrial Relations Act), the CIR has the authority to determine the meaning or interpretation of an award, and to alter, modify, or set it aside at any time during its effectiveness. Since the award in question was effective for three years until 1969, the CIR retained competence to act on the SSS petition filed in 1968.

The Court further held that failure to abide by orders of judicial and quasi-judicial agencies, even if doubt exists regarding jurisdiction, is unjustified. Orders must be faithfully complied with until modified by a higher tribunal, unless the court is "obviously traveling outside its orbit."

The petitions were **DISMISSED**.
