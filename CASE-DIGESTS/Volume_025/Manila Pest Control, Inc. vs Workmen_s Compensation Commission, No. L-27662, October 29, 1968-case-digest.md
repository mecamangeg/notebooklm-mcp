I. CAPTION
MANILA PEST CONTROL, INC. v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, ATANACIO A. MARDO, CITY SHERIFF OF MANILA, and MARIO ABITRIA, G.R. No. L-27662, October 29, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Mario Abitria (Respondent), a laborer for Manila Pest Control, Inc. (Petitioner) assigned to the Research Division, was exposed to poisonous chemical fumes and contracted pulmonary tuberculosis [1, 2]. He filed a claim with the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC). On February 24, 1967, the WCC referee heard the case; Petitioner's counsel, Atty. Manuel Corpuz, failed to appear, and a decision was rendered awarding Abitria P6,000.00 in compensation [3, 4]. Petitioner moved for reconsideration, alleging denial of due process because it was not officially furnished a copy of the decision [5]. However, WCC records showed that a process server attempted to deliver the copy to Atty. Corpuz on March 10, 1967, but he refused to accept it and instructed the server to deliver it to a certain Atty. Camacho, whose office subsequently received it [6]. A writ of execution was granted, leading Petitioner to file this petition for certiorari and prohibition [4, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Petitioner was denied due process regarding the service of the WCC decision.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that "no due process question arose" because the failure to effect service was attributable solely to the conduct of the Petitioner's own counsel [8]. The constitutional requirement was satisfied when an effort was made to serve the counsel of record, who refused receipt and directed delivery to another lawyer [8, 9]. The Court found the petition to be a deceptive attempt to use technicalities to evade a just obligation to a sick laborer [10, 11]. The Court further noted that the "unseemly conduct" of Atty. Corpuz warranted reproof [12].

The petition is DENIED, with treble costs against Petitioner's counsel, Attorney Manuel A. Corpuz [13].
