I. CAPTION
JOAQUIN P. NEMENZO v. BERNABE SABILLANO, G.R. No. L-20977, September 7, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Nemenzo, a civil service eligible, was appointed police corporal in Pagadian by Mayor Consolacion in March 1955 [1]. Upon assuming office on January 1, 1956, the new Mayor, defendant Sabillano, immediately terminated Nemenzo's services to replace him with a confidant and alleged veteran [2]. Nemenzo appealed to the Civil Service Commission (CSC), which declared the removal illegal as it was without cause [3, 4]. Sabillano reinstated Nemenzo on July 19, 1956 [5]. Nemenzo sought payment for back salaries through administrative channels, but the Auditor General disapproved the claim [6]. On September 4, 1959, Nemenzo filed a complaint for recovery of back salaries against Sabillano personally in the Justice of the Peace Court [7]. Both the Justice of the Peace Court and the Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Nemenzo, ordering Sabillano to pay P725.00 in back salaries and attorney's fees [8]. Sabillano appealed to the Supreme Court, raising issues of jurisdiction, prescription, laches, and the non-inclusion of the municipality as a party [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Justice of the Peace Court had jurisdiction over the case.
2. W/N the action is barred by prescription or laches.
3. W/N the Municipal Mayor is personally liable for the back salaries of the illegally dismissed employee.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The case involves an ordinary money claim which, considering the amount involved, falls within the original jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace Court [5, 10]. It was not an action to enforce the CSC decision or determine the legality of the dismissal, as the illegality was already a closed matter settled by the CSC and implemented by the appellant via reinstatement [5].

2. **NO.** The action is based on an injury to the plaintiff's rights due to illegal dismissal, which carries a prescriptive period of four years from the day the cause of action arose under Article 1146 of the Civil Code [6, 11]. Nemenzo filed within the statutory limit. Furthermore, laches does not apply because Nemenzo pursued his claim through government channels without delay and filed the complaint immediately after the Auditor General disapproved payment [6, 11].

3. **YES.** A public officer who dismisses an eligible employee without previous administrative investigation and without justifiable cause commits a clearly illegal act and is personally liable for the injury caused [12]. Appellant cannot hide under the mantle of his official capacity to pass liability to the municipality; thus, the municipality was not a proper party to the suit [12, 13]. Victory at the polls is not authority for the commission of illegal acts against civil service laws [12].

The judgment appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [14].
