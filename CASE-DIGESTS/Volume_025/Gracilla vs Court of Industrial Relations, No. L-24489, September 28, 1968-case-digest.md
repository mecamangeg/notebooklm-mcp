I. CAPTION
AUGUSTIN GRACILLA v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, FULLER PAINT MANUFACTURING CO., (PHIL.), INC. and REPUBLIC PROTECTIVE AGENCY, G.R. No. L-24489, September 28, 1968, Fernando, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Augustin Gracilla filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) on March 12, 1963, objecting to his dismissal as a security guard by respondent Fuller Paint Manufacturing Co. and seeking reinstatement [2]. He specifically claimed payment for unpaid services rendered on Sundays and legal holidays, additional compensation for night services, salary differentials, and vacation/sick leave pay, seeking to hold Fuller Paint and Republic Protective Agency jointly and severally liable [2, 3].

The CIR Presiding Judge dismissed the complaint for lack of merit on October 5, 1964, finding the dismissal was for cause, though suggesting a "separation fee" for humanitarian reasons [4]. However, the decision completely ignored and failed to rule upon the petitioner's monetary claims [3]. Gracilla filed a motion for reconsideration citing this oversight, but the CIR *en banc* denied it [3]. Judge Bugayong of the CIR dissented, noting the failure to resolve the specific monetary issues [5]. Gracilla appealed to the Supreme Court via certiorari [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR's failure to rule on the petitioner's monetary claims constitutes a denial of due process. [6]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the failure of the CIR to pass upon the monetary claims constituted a denial of due process [6, 7].

Citing the doctrine in *Ang Tibay v. Court of Industrial Relations* (69 Phil. 635), the Court held that while the CIR is free from rigid procedural requirements, it cannot disregard the "fundamental and essential requirements of due process" in administrative trials [7, 8]. One of the "cardinal primary rights" laid down in *Ang Tibay* is that the tribunal "should, in all controversial questions, render its decision in such a manner that the parties to the proceeding can know the various issues involved, and the reasons for the decisions rendered" [8, 9].

The CIR's failure to resolve the monetary claims, which were timely raised and insisted upon by the petitioner at all stages, amounted to a violation of this right [9, 10]. The Court emphasized that issues raised by a party should not be ignored or left undecided [9]. The Court also cited *Serrano v. Public Service Commission*, noting that administrative bodies must decide applications in a manner that informs the parties of the issues and reasons, which necessarily requires a finding of fact [10, 11].

The decision of the CIR was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** for further proceedings to consider the matter anew and pass upon the monetary claims [12].
