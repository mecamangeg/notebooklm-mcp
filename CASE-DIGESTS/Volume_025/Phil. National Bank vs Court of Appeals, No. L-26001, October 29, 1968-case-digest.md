I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and PHILIPPINE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BANK, G.R. No. L-26001, October 29, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On January 15, 1962, Augusto Lim deposited a GSIS check in the amount of P57,415.00, drawn against petitioner Philippine National Bank (PNB), into his current account with respondent Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank (PCIB). PCIB stamped the check with "All prior indorsements and/or Lack of Endorsement Guaranteed" and forwarded it to PNB for clearing [1, 2]. PNB did not return the check and paid the amount to PCIB, which then allowed Lim to withdraw the funds.

Subsequently, GSIS demanded that PNB re-credit the amount to its account because the signatures of its officers (the drawers) were forged. PNB re-credited the amount to GSIS and demanded a refund from PCIB, which refused [1]. It was established that two months prior to the deposit, GSIS had formally notified PNB that the specific check was lost and requested a "stop payment" order, which PNB had acknowledged [2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed PNB's complaint for recovery, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N PNB may recover from PCIB the amount paid on the forged check.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of PNB's complaint. The Court ruled that PNB could not recover for the following reasons:

1.  **Scope of Warranty:** PCIB's warranty on the back of the check guaranteed only "all prior indorsements," not the authenticity of the drawer's (GSIS) signatures. GSIS is not an indorser but the drawer, making the warranty irrelevant to PNB's claim [3, 4].
2.  **Proximate Cause and Negligence:** While PCIB may have been negligent, PNB was guilty of a "greater degree of negligence" because it had previous formal notice from GSIS to stop payment on the lost check [5, 6]. By failing to return the check and actually paying it, PNB induced PCIB to believe the check was genuine and pay Lim [5, 7].
3.  **Doctrine of Estoppel/Equity:** Applying the maxim of law and equity, "when one of two (2) innocent persons must suffer by the wrongful act of a third person, the loss must be borne by the one whose negligence was the proximate cause of the loss" [7, 8]. PNB's negligence was the proximate cause of the loss.
4.  **Acceptance vs. Payment:** The Court clarified that while "payment" is not strictly "acceptance" under the Negotiable Instruments Law, PNB's payment constituted not only assent to the drawer's order but compliance with the obligation, ending the check's life as a negotiable instrument [9-11].

**The decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.**
