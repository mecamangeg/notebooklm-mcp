I. CAPTION
PROCESO APOLEGA v. PERSEVERANDA HIZON, LUCIANO ALCANTARA, et al., G.R. No. L-23832, September 28, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Melanio Hizon, an employee of petitioner Proceso Apolega, suffered an injury on January 5, 1961, and filed a claim for compensation. Apolega received the requisite forms but failed to fill them out or controvert the claim [1]. An award was issued by the Regional Administrator. Hizon later died from the injury, and his widow, respondent Perseveranda Hizon, filed a death compensation claim in 1963 [2]. Apolega received notice but again failed to controvert the claim. A second award was issued in favor of the heirs [3].

Apolega was granted an extension to file a motion to vacate the award but failed to file the pleading. Consequently, the award was declared final and executory. Pursuant to Section 51 of the Workmen's Compensation Act as amended by R.A. 4119, the Regional Office issued a writ of execution against Apolega's properties [3]. Apolega filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition, arguing that the claim was time-barred, that the lack of notice and hearing violated due process, and that Section 17 of R.A. 4119 is unconstitutional for vesting the Commission with the power to issue writs of execution [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claim for compensation is barred by the failure to file within the reglementary period.
2. W/N the petitioner was denied due process due to the lack of a formal hearing.
3. W/N Section 17 of R.A. 4119 is constitutional in granting the Workmen's Compensation Commission the authority to issue writs of execution.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The failure to file the claim within the time prescribed in Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act is non-jurisdictional and does not bar the proceeding, provided the employer did not suffer by such delay [6]. Furthermore, the record showed the petitioner had made partial payments totaling P530.00 [7]. Under Section 24, as amended by R.A. 4119, such partial payment renders it unnecessary to file the claim within the statutory time limit [7].

2. **NO.** The petitioner failed to controvert the claims for both injury and death as required by Section 45 of the Workmen's Compensation Act [6]. By reason of such failure, he waived his right to present evidence and cannot complain that he was not heard. Under these circumstances, the hearing officer was justified in making the award without a formal hearing, treating the claim as uncontested [6].

3. **YES.** The Court upheld the constitutionality of R.A. 4119. While the power to enforce awards was previously removed from Regional Offices under Reorganization Plan 20-A due to lack of legislative authority, R.A. 4119 expressly vests this power in the Commission and deputized officials [8, 9]. This grant does not contravene the Constitution because execution is a procedural step that Congress may legislate upon under its constitutional authority to repeal, alter, or supplement rules regarding pleading, practice, and procedure (Section 13, Article VIII, Constitution) [9].

Petition dismissed; writ of preliminary injunction dissolved [10].
