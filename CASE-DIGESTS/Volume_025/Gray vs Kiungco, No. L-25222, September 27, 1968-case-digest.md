**I. CAPTION**
BESSIE M. GRAY, et al. v. VICENTE C. KIUNGCO, et al., G.R. No. L-25222, September 27, 1968, Concepcion, C.J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
On June 21, 1965, the Municipal Board of Tacloban City enacted Ordinance No. 11 prescribing rules for the operation of motorcabs. Respondents (Kiungco, et al.) secured permits to operate under said ordinance. However, at the behest of petitioners (Gray, et al., autocalesa operators), the Land Transportation Commission Registrar seized respondents' units, claiming the ordinance was void [2].

Respondents filed a complaint for declaratory relief with preliminary injunction (Civil Case No. B-096) before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte, presided by Judge Delfin Vir. Suñga. The CFI issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the seizure. Petitioners intervened and subsequently filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition, arguing that Judge Suñga lacked jurisdiction to entertain the case because the operation of motor vehicles falls under the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission (PSC), not the ordinary courts [3, 4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over a case involving the validity of a municipal ordinance regulating motorcabs. [5]

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, ruling that the issue in the lower court was not whether respondents should be granted a license or franchise, but whether Ordinance No. 11 was valid [5]. The Public Service Commission is not a judicial tribunal; its functions are limited and administrative. It cannot pass upon questions within the exclusive province of ordinary courts of justice, such as the validity of a contract or an ordinance [6-8]. Citing *Batangas Laguna Tayabas Bus Co. v. Public Service Commission*, the Court held that the determination of the ordinance's validity is manifestly beyond the jurisdiction of the PSC and within the competence of the CFI [8].

Petition dismissed and writ denied. [9]

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, Fernando, and Capistrano, JJ., concurred. Dizon and Zaldivar, JJ., did not take part. [9]
