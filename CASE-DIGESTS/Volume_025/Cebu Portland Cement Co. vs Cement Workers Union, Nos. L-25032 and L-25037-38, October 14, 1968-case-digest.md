I. CAPTION
CEBU PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY v. CEMENT WORKERS UNION, LOCAL 7-ALU and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. Nos. L-25032 and L-25037-38, October 14, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On March 24, 1961, about 300 workers of Cebu Portland Cement Company (CEPOC) staged a strike due to the company's refusal to include an "agency fee" provision for non-union members in their collective bargaining agreement. The dispute was certified to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). The CIR issued a return-to-work order, and the strikers returned to work on July 6, 1961. However, on August 4, 1961, while the dispute was pending, CEPOC issued a memorandum requiring employees to take three days of forced sick/vacation leave monthly.

In its decision, the CIR declared the strike illegal for having a trivial cause but dismissed the unfair labor practice charges. It found that CEPOC discriminated against union members regarding weekend work assignments, night shift differentials, and the job classification/salary of six specific employees. Consequently, the CIR ordered the payment of differentials and the restoration of leaves forced by the August 4 memorandum. However, the CIR denied CEPOC's plea to dismiss the workers who participated in the illegal strike. CEPOC appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR's finding of discrimination regarding weekend work and shift assignments is supported by substantial evidence.
2. W/N CEPOC discriminated against the six employees regarding their job classification and salary range.
3. W/N the enforcement of the forced leave policy violated the return-to-work order.
4. W/N the workers should be dismissed from service for participating in the illegal strike.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The CIR's findings must be respected as they are supported by substantial evidence showing that only non-strikers were granted the privilege of weekend work and shift changes [1]. Petitioner failed to disprove these findings or cite specific records to the contrary [2].

2. **NO.** The reclassification of the six employees to lower salary ranges was performed by WAPCO based on job descriptions submitted by the employees themselves, not by CEPOC [3]. The CIR's conclusion that CEPOC discriminated by failing to advise union members on how to complete their forms was based on a mere inference ("must have advised") derived from a lack of justification, rather than proved facts. A new inference cannot be drawn from another inference [4].

3. **YES.** An order to return to work is intended to restore strikers to their positions under the terms and conditions existing *before* the dispute arose, pursuant to Section 19 of Commonwealth Act 103 [5]. Therefore, CEPOC's enforcement of a new policy requiring employees to use up earned leaves without judicial authorization constituted a violation of the order to maintain the *status quo* [5].

4. **NO.** The strict doctrine in *Philippine Match Factory* (70 Phil. 300), which mandated dismissal for unjustified strikes, has been abandoned in favor of the discretionary power of the CIR [6, 7]. Since the demand for agency fees was made before the Supreme Court declared such fees unlawful in 1963, and the strikers returned to work when ordered, the CIR did not abuse its discretion in denying the dismissal [8]. Only those individually found guilty of unlawful acts committed during the strike may be separated from service [8].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed with modification; cases remanded to lower court for compliance with the judgment herein.
