I. CAPTION
CESAR C. ALTAREJOS v. TEODORO K. MOLO, Secretary of the Commission on Appointments, G.R. No. L-25726, October 21, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Altarejos received an *ad interim* appointment as Provincial Assessor of Masbate on July 24, 1964. The Commission on Appointments (CA) confirmed his appointment on May 19, 1965. On the same day, Congressman Aldeguer, a CA member, filed a motion for reconsideration (MR) of the confirmation. On May 20, 1965, before adjourning *sine die*, the CA approved a motion to lay all pending MRs on the table. Aldeguer subsequently withdrew his MR. Respondent Molo, the CA Secretary, refused to issue the certificate of confirmation, arguing that the mere filing of the MR recalled the confirmation, effectively bypassing the appointment upon adjournment. Petitioner filed this action for Mandamus.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the mere filing of a motion for reconsideration recalls the confirmation of an appointment.
2. W/N the principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies bars the petition.
3. W/N Mandamus lies to compel the Secretary to issue the certificate of confirmation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that under Rule 21 of the Revised Rules of the Commission on Appointments, the vote of a majority of members present is necessary to grant a reconsideration and "reopen" or "recall" a confirmation [1]. The mere filing of an MR only suspends the confirmation. Furthermore, the CA approved a motion to lay the MR on the table. Citing *Quimsing v. Tajanlangit*, the Court ruled that laying a motion on the table is a "final disposition," making it "as if no motion for reconsideration was filed at all" [2]. Consequently, the confirmation stands.

2. **NO.** The principle requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply when the issue is purely one of law, as is the case here [3, 4].

3. **YES.** Under Section 6 of the Revised Rules of the Commission, the Secretary has the duty to certify under his signature and seal the resolutions and orders of the Commission. Since the confirmation was valid and final, the respondent has the ministerial duty to issue the certificate of confirmation prayed for by the petitioner [5].

The Writ is GRANTED.
