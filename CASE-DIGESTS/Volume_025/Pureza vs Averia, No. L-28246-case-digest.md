I. CAPTION
ROGELIO PUREZA, et al. v. ALBERTO AVERIA, Judge, CFI of Cavite, et al., G.R. No. L-28246, September 28, 1968, 25 SCRA 269, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On September 30, 1967, three men were killed and one wounded in Rosario, Cavite. This led to two separate proceedings. First, on October 6, a PC corporal filed a complaint for triple murder and frustrated murder in the Municipal Court of Rosario against the "Ibias group." The municipal judge began the preliminary examination. Second, the victims' widows filed separate complaints in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cavite against the "Pureza group" (petitioners herein).

On October 9, CFI Judge Alberto Averia (respondent) referred the complaints filed in his court to the City Judge of Trece Martires, Ernesto Pepa (respondent), for preliminary investigation. Judge Pepa conducted a preliminary examination *ex parte* and issued warrants of arrest against the petitioners. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari and injunction with the Supreme Court, arguing that the Municipal Court of Rosario had a better right to conduct the investigation and that the warrants were void because the examination was conducted in their absence.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CFI of Cavite (and by referral the City Court of Trece Martires) has jurisdiction to investigate the charges despite a pending case in the Municipal Court of Rosario for the same crime against different accused.
2. W/N the warrants of arrest issued by the City Judge are void for being issued after an *ex parte* preliminary examination.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the crimes charged (murder and frustrated murder) are within the original exclusive jurisdiction of the CFI. The fact that a complaint was filed in the Municipal Court of Rosario against different persons does not deprive the CFI of jurisdiction to investigate charges against the petitioners. Furthermore, Rule 112, Section 13 of the Rules of Court expressly allows the CFI, upon receiving a complaint, to refer it to a municipal or city judge for preliminary examination and investigation.

2. **NO.** Under Rule 112, Sections 5 and 6, the preliminary examination by a municipal or city judge to determine probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest may be conducted "either in the presence or absence of the accused." The accused is not entitled to be present prior to the issuance of the warrant. The right to a preliminary investigation (where the accused can present evidence) arises only *after* arrest, as provided in Section 10 of Rule 112. Thus, the validity of the warrants was not affected by the *ex parte* nature of the examination.

The petition is **DISMISSED**, the writs prayed for are **DENIED**, and the restraining order is **SET ASIDE**.
