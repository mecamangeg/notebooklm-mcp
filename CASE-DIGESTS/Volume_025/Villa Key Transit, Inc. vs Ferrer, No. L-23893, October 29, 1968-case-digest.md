I. CAPTION
VILLA REY TRANSIT, INC. v. EUSEBIO E. FERRER, PANGASINAN TRANSPORTATION CO., INC., and PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-23893, October 29, 1968, 25 SCRA 845, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Jose M. Villarama, operator of Villa Rey Transit (a sole proprietorship), sold two certificates of public convenience (CPCs) to Pangasinan Transportation Co. (Pantranco) for P350,000.00. The deed of sale stipulated that Villarama "shall not for a period of 10 years... apply for any TPU service identical or competing with the buyer." Three months later, Villa Rey Transit, Inc. (Corporation) was organized with Villarama's wife as an incorporator and treasurer. The Corporation then purchased five CPCs from Valentin Fernando.

Before the Public Service Commission (PSC) could finally approve the sale between Fernando and the Corporation, the Sheriff levied on two of these CPCs to satisfy a judgment against Fernando in favor of Eusebio Ferrer. Ferrer purchased the CPCs at the auction and subsequently sold them to Pantranco. The Corporation filed a suit to annul the Sheriff's sale. Pantranco filed a third-party complaint against Villarama, alleging that the Corporation was his *alter ego* organized to evade the non-compete clause. The trial court ruled in favor of the Corporation, declaring it the lawful owner of the CPCs and the non-compete clause void.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the stipulation prohibiting Villarama from applying for competing TPU services for 10 years is valid.
2. W/N Villa Rey Transit, Inc. is the *alter ego* of Villarama.
3. W/N the Corporation is bound by the restrictive clause and enjoined from operating the line.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The 10-year restrictive clause is valid. While it suppresses competition, it is merely ancillary to the main contract of sale and is reasonable regarding scope, duration, and territory. The restraint refers only to lines competing with those sold, lasts only 10 years, and does not create a monopoly but protects the goodwill acquired by the buyer (Pantranco). The Court cited the rule that contracts in restraint of trade are valid if limited to a certain time and place (Del Castillo v. Richmond).

2. **YES.** The Corporation is the *alter ego* of Villarama. Evidence showed that Villarama mingled his personal funds with the Corporation's, paid its initial capital with his personal check, and managed its finances as if they were his own. The doctrine of separate corporate personality is disregarded when the fiction is used to perpetrate fraud, evade existing obligations, or confuse legitimate issues (Koppel Phil. v. Yatco).

3. **YES.** Since the Corporation is the *alter ego* of Villarama, the restrictive clause is enforceable against it. A seller cannot use a corporate entity to evade a covenant. Although the Corporation validly acquired ownership of the CPCs from Fernando (as the Sheriff's sale to Ferrer was subject to *caveat emptor* and the Corporation was a prior purchaser in good faith under Art. 1544 of the Civil Code), it is nonetheless enjoined from operating the lines subject to the prohibition for the duration of the 10-year period.

Judgment reversed with modification; the Corporation is enjoined from operating the competing lines, and the case is remanded for the determination of damages in favor of Pantranco.
