I. CAPTION
MARIA O. SARMIENTO, FELINO S. ACLAN, RODOLFO S. ACLAN and TING SING v. HON. VICTORIANO H. ENDAYA, THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF BATANGAS, ROMAN O. SARMIENTO and TRINIDAD TORRES, G.R. No. L-23270, October 29, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Roman O. Sarmiento and Trinidad Torres filed a complaint for ejectment (Civil Case No. 1058) in the Municipal Court of Batangas against certain defendants. Petitioners Maria O. Sarmiento, et al., filed an Answer in Intervention, claiming co-ownership of the disputed land by inheritance [1, 2]. On November 2, 1963, respondent Judge Endaya rendered a decision ordering the defendants and intervenors to vacate the premises [3].

Petitioners did not appeal the decision. Instead, they filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Batangas, alleging that Judge Endaya committed grave abuse of discretion and that they only learned of the decision after the appeal period had expired and a writ of execution had been issued [3, 4]. The CFI, presided by Judge Relova, issued an order on April 28, 1964, dismissing the petition, finding that petitioners were represented by counsel who received the decision but failed to appeal, and that the proper remedy was an appeal, not certiorari [5]. Petitioners appealed this order to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for certiorari and prohibition is the proper remedy to challenge the Municipal Court's decision.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CFI's order, ruling that an appeal would have been the proper remedy [7]. The Court found that petitioners were represented by counsel in the ejectment case who evidently received a copy of the decision but failed to appeal within the reglementary period [5, 8]. It is a settled principle that certiorari with preliminary injunction is not proper where the remedy of appeal is available [9, 10].

The Court further reasoned that petitioners' claim of denial of due process (lack of notice) was devoid of merit. If they were represented by the same counsel as the defendants, notice to counsel was notice to them. Conversely, if they were not served a copy of the decision as they claimed, their period to appeal would not have commenced until actual receipt, meaning the remedy of appeal was still available to them, rendering certiorari unnecessary [7, 8].

**Order affirmed.**
