I. CAPTION
FIELDMEN'S INSURANCE CO., INC. v. MERCEDES VARGAS VDA. DE SONGCO, ET AL. and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-24833, September 23, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Federico Songco, a man of scant education who finished only the first grade, owned a private jeepney. On September 15, 1960, Benjamin Sambat, an agent of Fieldmen's Insurance Co., induced Songco to apply for a Common Carrier's Liability Insurance Policy. Songco expressed concern that his vehicle was an "owner" private vehicle and not for passengers, but Sambat assured him that the company could insure it regardless [1, 2]. Songco paid the premium, and the policy was issued and later renewed. On October 29, 1961, while the renewed policy was in effect, the jeepney was involved in a collision in Bulacan while being driven by Rodolfo Songco [1]. The accident resulted in the deaths of Federico and Rodolfo, and physical injuries to other passengers [1]. Fieldmen's Insurance denied liability, arguing that the vehicle was not a common carrier [3]. The lower court ruled in favor of Songco's heirs, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Fieldmen's Insurance is estopped from denying liability on the ground that the vehicle was not a common carrier.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals, applying the doctrine of estoppel [4]. The Court held that since the insurer's agent knew the vehicle was private but discounted the insured's fears and led him to believe he could qualify under the common carrier policy, the company is estopped from enforcing forfeitures in its favor [4, 5]. The Court cited *Qua Chee Gan v. Law Union and Rock Insurance Co., Ltd.*, stating that an insurance contract is one of perfect good faith (*uberrima fides*) and where inequitable conduct is shown by the insurance firm, it cannot change its stand to the detriment of the insured who relied on its representations [6, 7]. Furthermore, the Court emphasized that insurance policies are contracts of adhesion, and any ambiguities must be strictly interpreted against the insurer to protect the weaker party from abuses [8, 9]. The decision of the Court of Appeals was affirmed [10].
