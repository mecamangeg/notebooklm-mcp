I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION v. BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS and JOSE MA. TORRES, G.R. No. L-25135, September 21, 1968, 25 SCRA 29, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Jose Ma. Torres, a Spanish subject and graduate of the University of Barcelona with a Licentiate in Medicine and Surgery, sought to practice medicine in the Philippines. After several revocations of his special authority to practice in Basilan City, the Board of Medical Examiners issued Resolution No. 25, series of 1965, which was approved by the President. This resolution granted Torres a certificate to practice medicine in the Philippines without taking the board examination, relying on the 1949 Treaty on the Validity of Academic Degrees and the Exercise of the Professions between the Philippines and Spain [1], [2].

Petitioner Philippine Medical Association (PMA) challenged the resolution, arguing that under Republic Act No. 2882 (Medical Act of 1959), Torres must pass the licensure examination [3]. Respondents claimed PMA lacked standing and failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not appealing to the President [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N PMA has the legal standing to institute the action.
2. W/N the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies.
3. W/N the 1949 Treaty entitles a Spanish subject to practice medicine in the Philippines without passing the board examination required by R.A. No. 2882.

IV. RULING
**1. YES.** The Court held that PMA has sufficient interest in the outcome of the case to clothe it with the requisite standing to institute the action, distinguishing it from prior cases where individuals had no special interest in the relief prayed for [5], [6].

**2. NO.** The rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies is subject to exceptions, including cases involving only questions of law or where the questioned act bears the approval of a department secretary or the President. Here, the disputed resolution was already approved by the Executive Secretary "by authority of the President," making further appeal to the President unnecessary [6].

**3. NO.** The Treaty expressly provides that the privilege of nationals to exercise professions in the other state is "subject to the laws and regulations of the latter" [7]. The laws of the Philippines, specifically R.A. No. 2882, require that before anyone can practice the medical profession, they must successfully pass the Board examinations. The Court held that the Treaty merely extends to Spanish diplomas the same recognition accorded to local diplomas; it does not exempt holders from the examination requirement [8]. To rule otherwise would place graduates of Spanish institutions in a better position than graduates of Philippine institutions, discriminating against Filipino nationals [9].

**Petition is GRANTED.** Resolution No. 25, series of 1965, is declared null and void, and the Board of Medical Examiners is ordered to cancel the certificate of registration issued to Jose Ma. Torres [8].
