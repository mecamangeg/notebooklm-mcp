I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. NORMAN VIÑAS, G.R. No. L-21756, October 28, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of April 10, 1962, Jesus Varela was stabbed to death from behind while urinating at the Bacolod Murcia Sugar Central premises. Prosecution witnesses Rodolfo Sumpay and Mario Derla testified that shortly before the killing, brothers Nelson and Norman Viñas revealed their plan to kill Varela. Norman specifically stated that Varela had committed a "fault" against him. Subsequently, Nelson stabbed Varela. The Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros convicted both brothers of murder and sentenced them to *reclusión perpetua*. Only Norman Viñas appealed, raising the defense of alibi, claiming he was in Hinigaran attending a birthday party at the time of the incident, and challenging the credibility of the prosecution witnesses due to alleged contradictions.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the prosecution witnesses’ testimony is credible despite alleged contradictions.
2. W/N the defense of alibi is valid.
3. W/N conspiracy existed between the appellant and his brother.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that contradictions in testimony regarding details of a startling occurrence are to be expected when recalled two years later. Such contradictions indicate veracity rather than prevarication. Furthermore, the appellant failed to reference specific pages of the transcript to support his assignment of error, violating Section 16(f), Rule 46 of the Rules of Court.

2. **NO.** The alibi was insufficient because Hinigaran is only 50 kilometers away (an hour and a half by jeepney) from Bacolod. It was not physically impossible for the accused to be at the scene of the crime and return.

3. **YES.** Conspiracy was proven by the presence of both brothers at the scene, their remarks to the witness Sumpay just before the crime, and the fact that Nelson assaulted the deceased despite having no personal grudge against him, acting instead on Norman's motive.

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
