I. CAPTION
ISABELO PINZA v. TEOFILO ALDOVINO and CITY COURT OF LUCENA, BRANCH II, G.R. No. L-25226, September 27, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pinza was charged with perjury in Criminal Case No. 1246 before the City Court of Lucena. He filed a petition for certiorari in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon to annul the information and dismiss the criminal case, alleging the preliminary investigation was invalid and asserting a prejudicial question. Respondents moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that the CFI lacked supervisory jurisdiction over the City Court. The CFI Judge dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. Pinza appealed directly to the Supreme Court, also arguing that respondent Aldovino (a non-lawyer) committed contempt by filing an answer on behalf of the respondent Judge [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari against a City Court exercising concurrent jurisdiction.
2. W/N the private respondent is guilty of contempt for filing an answer on behalf of the respondent judge.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court of First Instance (CFI) has no supervisory jurisdiction over the City Court in cases where they share concurrent jurisdiction. Perjury falls within the concurrent jurisdiction of the municipal/city court and the CFI under Section 87 of the Judiciary Act (R.A. 296) [5]. Once a City Court takes cognizance of such a case, its judgment is appealable directly to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, not the CFI [5, 6]. Furthermore, in cases of concurrent jurisdiction, the City Court acts with "like jurisdiction" and is not considered an "inferior court" to the CFI within the meaning of Section 4, Rule 65 [7].

2. **NO.** Respondent Aldovino was not guilty of contempt. Under Section 5, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, it is the duty of the person interested in sustaining the proceedings (the private respondent) to appear and defend both in his own behalf and in behalf of the court or judge affected [8]. The judge is merely a nominal party with no personal interest in the certiorari case [9].

The order of dismissal is affirmed, with treble costs against the appellant for taking the appeal to delay the criminal case [9].
