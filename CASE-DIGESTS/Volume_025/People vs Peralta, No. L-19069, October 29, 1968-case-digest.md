I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AMADEO PERALTA, ET AL., No. L-19069, October 29, 1968, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On February 16, 1958, a riot erupted in the New Bilibid Prison caused by the rivalry between the "Sigue-Sigue" and "OXO" gangs [1]. The six accused—Amadeo Peralta, Andres Factora, Leonardo Dosal, Angel Parumog, Gervasio Larita, and Florencio Luna—were inmates of Brigade 4-A and members or sympathizers of the "OXO" gang [2, 3]. Acting in concert, they destroyed the lock of their brigade, armed themselves with improvised weapons, and invaded other brigades to attack "Sigue-Sigue" members [4]. They killed three inmates: Jose Carriego, Eugenio Barbosa, and Santos Cruz [4, 5]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal convicted all six accused of multiple murder, finding that conspiracy attended the crimes, and sentenced each to death [2]. The case was elevated to the Supreme Court for automatic review.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N conspiracy attended the commission of the murders.
2. W/N the accused may be sentenced to multiple death penalties for the separate crimes committed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the accused acted in concert from the moment they bolted their brigade until the killing of the last victim [3]. Their acts—arming themselves, moving with teamwork precision, and singling out specific Tagalog victims—clearly demonstrated a common design [6]. Once conspiracy is proved, the act of one is the act of all, making all conspirators liable as co-principals for every crime committed in furtherance of the conspiracy, regardless of individual participation in the actual killing [7, 8].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that conspirators are liable for *each* felonious act committed as a result of the conspiracy [9]. Since the accused committed three separate and distinct murders, each is guilty of three murders and must suffer the corresponding penalty for each offense [10, 11]. The Court rejected the argument that multiple death penalties are a "useless formality," stating that Art. 70 of the Revised Penal Code presupposes the authority to impose multiple penalties [12]. Furthermore, imposing multiple penalties reflects the convict's criminal perversity and serves as a deterrent against executive clemency [13]. Due to the aggravating circumstance of *quasi-recidivism* (Art. 160, RPC), as the accused were serving final sentences, the maximum penalty was mandatory [14].

The judgment was **MODIFIED**; each of the six accused was found guilty of three separate and distinct crimes of murder and sentenced to **three death penalties** [15].
