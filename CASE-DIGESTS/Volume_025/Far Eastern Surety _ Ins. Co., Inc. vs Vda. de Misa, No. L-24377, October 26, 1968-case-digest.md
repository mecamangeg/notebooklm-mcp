I. CAPTION
FAR EASTERN SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY, INC. v. SOCORRO DANCEL VDA. DE MISA, ARACELI MARIA PINTO and LA MALLORCA, G.R. No. L-24377, October 26, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On September 3, 1957, respondents Socorro Dancel Vda. de Misa and Araceli Maria Pinto were injured while riding a taxicab operated by La Mallorca, which collided with a gravel and sand truck driven by a third party [1]. They filed a suit for damages against La Mallorca. La Mallorca filed a third-party complaint against petitioner Far Eastern Surety & Insurance Company, Inc. (Far Eastern) based on its Common Carrier's Accident Insurance policy [1].

The Court of First Instance (CFI) ruled in favor of the passengers and held Far Eastern liable to La Mallorca on the third-party complaint [2]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) found that the collision was due solely to the fault of the truck driver, not the taxicab [2]. However, the CA still held La Mallorca liable to its passengers based on **estoppel**, as a sticker in the taxi represented that passengers were "insured" [2, 3]. Consequently, the CA held Far Eastern liable to reimburse La Mallorca under the insurance policy [2]. La Mallorca did not appeal the decision, but Far Eastern petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing its liability was limited by the policy terms [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the insurer (Far Eastern) is liable under the accident insurance policy for damages adjudged against the insured (La Mallorca) based solely on the insured's estoppel.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the insurer is not liable. The insurance policy limited the insurer's liability to "all sums... which the Insured shall become legally liable" to pay in the "event of accident caused by or arising out of the use of the Motor Vehicle" [5].

The Court noted that the CA explicitly found the accident was caused by the negligence of the truck driver, not the taxicab driver [6]. La Mallorca was held liable solely because of its representation (via sticker) to passengers that they were insured, creating an obligation based on estoppel [5, 6]. While La Mallorca is bound by this representation, the estoppel does not extend to Far Eastern, as the insurer did not authorize, consent to, or know of the representation made by the carrier [6]. Therefore, the source of the award was outside the contemplation of the parties to the insurance contract [6].

**Disposition:** The decision of the Court of Appeals is MODIFIED by eliminating the award against Far Eastern Surety & Insurance Co., Inc. [7].
