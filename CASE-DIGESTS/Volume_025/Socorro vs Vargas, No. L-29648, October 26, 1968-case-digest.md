I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO SOCORRO v. NORA VARGAS and LEOCADIO VARGAS, G.R. No. L-29648, October 26, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Francisco Socorro, a timber concessionaire, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Surigao against defendant spouses Nora and Leocadio Vargas, sawmill owners, for breach of contract. The complaint alleged four causes of action: (1) failure to pay forest charges, sales taxes, and the price of logs; (2) reimbursement for expenses paid to third parties; (3) the value of a carabao; and (4) the surreptitious cutting and removal of 300,000 board feet of export logs resulting in damages.

Pablo Dumlao filed an answer in intervention, claiming that "part" of the logs mentioned in the fourth cause of action came from his concession area, citing a boundary survey by the Bureau of Forestry. Based on this, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the complaint failed to state a cause of action because it was premature and failed to exhaust administrative remedies regarding the "boundary dispute." The lower court granted the motion and dismissed the entire complaint without prejudice, ruling that the boundary conflict must first be settled by the Bureau of Forestry.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court erred in dismissing the complaint on the ground of a boundary dispute raised in the intervention.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal order.

First, the Court ruled that the lower court erred in dismissing the first three causes of action (collection of money and value of a carabao). These claims were distinct and totally unrelated to the alleged boundary dispute affecting the fourth cause of action [1].

Second, regarding the fourth cause of action, the Court held that the "boundary dispute" was a factual issue raised in the answer and intervention, not in the complaint itself. The Court reiterated the accepted rule that to determine whether a complaint states a cause of action, only the allegations of the complaint—taking them to be true—should be considered, and courts should not go beyond those averred facts (*Republic Bank v. Cuaderno*; *Worldwide Insurance Company v. Manuel*) [2]. A factual defense like a boundary dispute cannot be determined in a motion to dismiss but must be the subject of a full-dress trial [3].

The Order of dismissal was set aside and the record was remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings [4].
