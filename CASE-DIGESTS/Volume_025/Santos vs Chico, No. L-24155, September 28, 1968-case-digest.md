I. CAPTION
DELFIN SANTOS, ET AL. v. ROBERTO E. CHICO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-24155, September 28, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Delfin Santos and others were appointed as municipal policemen of Baliuag, Bulacan, on August 1, 1962, by then-Mayor Felix R. Tiongson. These appointments were issued as "temporary" but were subsequently attested as "provisional" by the Commissioner of Civil Service [1]. On January 15, 1964, the incumbent Mayor, respondent Roberto Chico, terminated their services [1]. Petitioners filed a petition for mandamus, arguing that the Commissioner's approval converted their appointments to provisional status, granting them protection against replacement by non-eligibles [2]. The Court of First Instance of Bulacan dismissed the petition, ruling that the appointments remained temporary and terminable at any time [3]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court on points of law [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Civil Service Commissioner has the authority to change the nature of an appointment from temporary to provisional, thereby granting the appointee security of tenure.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. The Court ruled that under the Civil Service Law (R.A. 2260), the determination of the kind of appointment (permanent, provisional, or temporary) rests with the appointing officer—in this case, the Municipal Mayor—and not with the Civil Service Commissioner [3]. The Commissioner's power is limited to approving or rejecting appointments based on statutory compliance; he cannot supersede the discretion of the appointing officer regarding the nature of the appointment [3]. The Commissioner's act of changing the appointment from temporary to provisional constituted an "unwarranted invasion of the discretion of the appointing officer" and is inoperative [5]. Consequently, the petitioners' appointments remained temporary. Citing *Jimenea v. Guanzon*, the Court reiterated that temporary appointees do not enjoy security of tenure and their services may be terminated at any time at the pleasure of the appointing power without need to show cause [6, 7].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [8].
