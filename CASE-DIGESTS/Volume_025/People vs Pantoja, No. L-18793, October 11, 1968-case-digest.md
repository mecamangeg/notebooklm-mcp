I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GETULIO PANTOJA, G.R. No. L-18793, October 11, 1968, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of June 28, 1957, in Malinao, Quezon, a group of young men including Angel Marasigan and Wenceslao Hernandez were serenading Estelita Erotes [1]. Around 1:30 A.M., Appellant Sgt. Getulio Pantoja, uninvited and in a T-shirt, asked to sit beside Estelita but was refused by Hernandez [2]. Pantoja left without showing anger, returned to his camp, put on his fatigue uniform, and armed himself with a Garand rifle [2]. As the serenaders walked to another house, Pantoja followed them and, from a distance of five meters, suddenly fired two shots in rapid succession [2]. The first shot killed Marasigan and the second killed Hernandez [2]. Pantoja voluntarily surrendered immediately after [3]. The lower court convicted him of a complex crime of double murder and sentenced him to death [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused is guilty of a complex crime of double murder.
2. W/N the aggravating circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation are present.
3. W/N the defense of insanity is meritorious.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the appellant is guilty of two separate and distinct murders, not a complex crime [5]. Under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code, a complex crime exists when a single act constitutes two or more crimes [6]. Here, the records established that Pantoja fired two distinct shots—one killing Marasigan and the other killing Hernandez—rather than a single shot killing both [6]. Thus, the penalty must be imposed for each murder separately.

2. **YES** (Treachery) / **NO** (Evident Premeditation). Treachery was present because the appellant followed the victims and suddenly fired from behind without warning, ensuring the execution of the crime without risk to himself [7]. However, evident premeditation was ruled out because the interval of approximately 30 minutes between the refusal by Hernandez and the shooting was insufficient for full meditation and reflection [7]. The time was too short for his conscience to overcome the resolution of his will [7].

3. **NO.** The defense of insanity failed because the legal presumption of sanity was reinforced by evidence that Pantoja was calm and collected during the commission of the crime [8]. Furthermore, the medical report showed he suffered from psychoneurotic reactions but was not insane [9].

The judgment was **MODIFIED**. Recognizing the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender [3], the Court sentenced Pantoja to an indeterminate penalty of 15 years to 20 years for *each* of the two murders and increased compensatory damages to P12,000.00 for each victim [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. Justices Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred; Justice Zaldivar did not take part [11].
