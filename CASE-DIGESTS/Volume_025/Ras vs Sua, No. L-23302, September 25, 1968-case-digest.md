I. CAPTION
ALEJANDRO RAS v. ESTELA SUA and RAMON SUA, G.R. No. L-23302, September 25, 1968, 25 SCRA 153, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Alejandro Ras acquired a parcel of land from the National Abaca and Other Fibers Corporation (NAFCO) on installments in 1951. On February 25, 1958, while still within the prohibited period for encumbrance under Republic Act No. 477, Ras leased the land to Spouses Sua for three years. The lease was subsequently extended through various contracts until 1968. When Spouses Sua failed to pay the agreed taxes and installments to the government, Ras filed a complaint in 1963 for the annulment of the lease and recovery of possession. The spouses moved to dismiss, arguing the action was for rescission and had prescribed (barred by the 4-year prescriptive period). The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Ras, annulling the contracts executed within the prohibited period and ordering the return of the land, holding that the lease violated R.A. 477. Spouses Sua appealed, insisting on the defense of prescription and the illegality of the contract.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action to recover the land is barred by prescription.
2. W/N the plaintiff can recover the property despite the parties being *in pari delicto* regarding the illegal lease.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The action is not barred by prescription. While the complaint was captioned as one for rescission, the allegations established a cause of action for the declaration of the inexistence of a contract in violation of Section 8 of Republic Act No. 477 [1, 2]. The right to seek the declaration of the inexistence of a contract, for being in violation of law, is imprescriptible [3]. Furthermore, even if considered an action for rescission, the separate lease contracts executed in 1960 and 1962 were distinct agreements with their own terms, and the action regarding them had not prescribed [3, 4].

2. **YES.** The plaintiff may recover the property. While the lease was illegal for violating the prohibition on encumbrance within 10 years under R.A. 477, the doctrine of *in pari delicto* does not apply [5]. Under Article 1416 of the Civil Code, when an agreement is not illegal *per se* but merely prohibited, and the prohibition is designed for the protection of the plaintiff, he may recover if public policy is enhanced [6, 7]. Violations of R.A. 477 do not result in automatic reversion to the State; reversion requires a specific proceeding instituted by the government [5]. Denying recovery would run counter to the public policy of enabling landless citizens to own land [5, 8]. Thus, until the State asserts title, the grantee has a better right to possession than the intruder [5].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed [9].
