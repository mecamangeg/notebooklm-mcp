I. CAPTION
ELPIDIO MARCELO v. REYNALDO MATIAS, PEDRO MANGAYAO, HONORIO GONZALES and HON. JOSE M. SANTOS, Presiding Judge, COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-22252, October 29, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents-tenants (Matias, Mangayao, and Gonzales) filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) on May 22, 1962, to change their tenancy relationship with petitioner-landowner Marcelo from a share tenancy system to leasehold, pursuant to Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199 [1]. Marcelo countered by filing ejectment cases against the tenants for alleged failure to deliver his share of the harvests [1, 2]. On October 30, 1962, the CAR rendered a joint decision dismissing the ejectment cases, upholding the constitutionality of Section 14 of R.A. No. 1199, and declaring the relationship to be one of leasehold tenancy effectively fixing the rentals [2]. Marcelo petitioned for review, raising the sole issue of the constitutionality of Section 14 [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199, which allows a tenant to unilaterally change the tenancy contract from share tenancy to leasehold, is constitutional.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations [3]. The Court held that the constitutionality of Section 14 of R.A. No. 1199 has been consistently upheld in a long line of decisions, including *De Ramas v. CAR* and *Del Rosario v. De los Santos* [4]. The provision is justified by the State's police power and the constitutional mandates on protection to labor and social justice [5]. The Court emphasized that public interest is served by measures aiding the economically underprivileged, and such legislative acts are rational adjustments of conflicting claims to property and state authority [5].

The decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations is affirmed [3].
