I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DAMASO ATIENZA, G.R. No. L-19857, October 26, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Damaso Atienza was charged with grave oral defamation in the Municipal Court of Cagayan de Oro City for allegedly calling the offended party, Pilar Lee, a "puta" (prostitute) [1]. The case was initiated via a sworn complaint signed by Lee, which was also signed by the special counsel acting as public prosecutor [1].

When the trial was already well advanced, with only the defense's sur-rebuttal witness remaining, Atienza moved to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction [2]. He argued that under Article VII, Section 24 of the City Charter of Cagayan de Oro (R.A. No. 521), the case should have been prosecuted via an information signed by the prosecutor, not a complaint by the offended party [2, 3]. The Municipal Court sustained the motion and dismissed the case [3]. The Prosecution appealed [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipal Court erred in dismissing the case on the ground that it was initiated by a complaint filed by the offended party rather than an information filed by the prosecutor.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal was erroneous [4]. The provision in the City Charter imposing a duty on the City Attorney to investigate and prepare informations is not restrictive and does not exclude the victim from filing a complaint to launch a criminal action [4, 5].

Under Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code, the prohibition against complaints filed by the offended party applies only to crimes that *cannot* be prosecuted *de officio* (e.g., adultery, concubinage) [5]. As held in *Balite v. People*, for crimes that *can* be prosecuted *de officio*, the law does not prohibit the offended party from starting the action via complaint [5, 6]. Furthermore, the complaint in this case was actually signed by the public prosecuting officer, who retained control of the prosecution throughout the trial [7]. Finally, the technical objection regarding jurisdiction was raised too late in the proceedings and was deemed waived [7, 8].

The order of dismissal was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the court of origin for further proceedings [9].
