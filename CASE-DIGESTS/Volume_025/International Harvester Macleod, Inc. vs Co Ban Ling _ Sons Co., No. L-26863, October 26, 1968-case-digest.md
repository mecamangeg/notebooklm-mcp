I. CAPTION
INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER MACLEOD, INC. v. CO BAN LING & SONS CO., ET AL., G.R. No. L-26863, October 26, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On September 10, 1965, International Harvester Macleod, Inc. filed a complaint in the City Court of Manila to recover P2,500.00 from Co Ban Ling & Sons Co. [1]. The City Court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, ordering the defendants to pay the amount plus interest and attorney's fees [1]. The defendants appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [1]. Upon the defendants' own motion, the CFI scheduled a pre-trial conference for August 15, 1966 [2]. However, the defendants failed to appear on said date and instead filed a last-minute *ex parte* motion for postponement, citing their counsel's conflict of schedule [2]. The CFI denied the postponement, deeming it a delaying tactic, and dismissed the appeal for failure to prosecute, ordering the case remanded to the City Court for execution [2]. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the perfection of their appeal vacated the City Court's judgment and that the CFI should have proceeded with a trial *de novo* instead of dismissing the appeal [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance correctly dismissed the appeal due to the defendants' failure to appear at the pre-trial conference.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal. Under Sections 1 and 2, Rule 20 of the Rules of Court, pre-trial is mandatory, and parties and their counsel are required to appear [4]. The failure of a party to appear allows the court to consider them non-suited or in default [4]. In this case, the defendants, who were the appellants and had requested the pre-trial themselves, failed to appear, justifying the dismissal of their appeal for failure to prosecute [5].

Furthermore, pursuant to Section 9, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court, when an appeal is dismissed for failure to prosecute, the judgment of the lower court (City Court) is deemed revived [5, 6]. Consequently, the case was correctly remanded to the City Court for the execution of the original judgment [5].

The order of the lower court is affirmed [7].
