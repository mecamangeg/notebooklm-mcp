I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC TELEPHONE CO., INC. v. PHILIPPINE LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE CO., INC., CALTEX (PHILIPPINES) INC., and PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, G.R. Nos. L-21070, L-21074, and L-21075, September 23, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J. [1], [2], [3]

II. FACTS
PLDT and Caltex (Philippines) Inc. entered into a contract where PLDT established communication facilities connecting Caltex’s refinery in Bauan, Batangas, to its head office in Manila [4]. This system, which commenced operation on January 28, 1953, utilized a Private Automatic Branch Exchange (PABX) at both locations and allowed calls between Bauan and Manila, effectively functioning as a toll station after office hours [4], [5]. PLDT did not secure prior approval from the Public Service Commission (PSC) for this installation [6], [7].

Republic Telephone Co., Inc. (RETELCO), which was granted a certificate of public convenience to operate a local telephone service in Batangas in 1956 and Bauan in 1959, filed a complaint in 1960 against PLDT’s alleged illegal operation [8], [9]. PLDT and Caltex argued that the line was a mere private extension of the Manila office [9]. The PSC ruled that PLDT violated the Public Service Law but, in the interest of the public, did not order discontinuance; instead, it imposed a daily fine of P10.00 from 1953 until PLDT filed for the proper certificate [10], [11]. All parties appealed [11].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N PLDT violated the Public Service Law by extending its service to Bauan without prior PSC approval. [12]
2. W/N the imposition of the fine was barred by prescription. [6]
3. W/N the PSC erred in refusing to order the discontinuance of PLDT’s unauthorized service. [13]

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 20(b) of the Public Service Law (Commonwealth Act No. 146) makes it unlawful for any public service to "make any other addition to or general extension of the service" without prior Commission approval [14]. The Court held that the law does not contemplate mere transfers of telephones within a house, but undertakings of size or complexity [15]. The subject installation involved 188 telephone units and extended service 117 kilometers away from Manila, clearly outside PLDT's authorized "Manila and suburbs" territory [5], [16]. Such an extension is not "limited" or "specific" but constitutes a "general extension" requiring prior authorization [15], [17].

2. **NO.** While Section 28 of the Public Service Law provides for prescription of violations, the period is reckoned from the date of discovery of the violation [18]. The Court cited *Pangasinan Trans. Co. v. Phil. Farming Co., Ltd.*, stating that there was no representation of when the illegality was discovered by the complainant [18]. Therefore, the offense remained punishable, as "an offense remains an offense, whether discovered or not" [18].

3. **NO.** The Court affirmed the PSC's decision to allow the operation to continue because "public interest and convenience must be the prime consideration" in granting certificates [19]. Citing *Cababa v. Remigio*, the Court held that the PSC is in the best position to gauge what serves the public interest [19]. The PSC found that maintaining the service was beneficial to the public, despite the violation [13], [19].

**Disposition:** Judgment affirmed. [1]
