I. CAPTION
EDILBERTO M. RAMOS, et al. v. HON. GUILLERMO TORRES, et al., G.R. No. L-23454, October 25, 1968, 25 SCRA 552, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, officers and personnel of the Philippine Army Finance Service, were charged with "malversation through falsification of public and commercial documents" in Criminal Case No. 11440 regarding alleged fictitious emergency lumber purchases [1, 2]. Subsequently, numerous other criminal cases were filed or investigated against them by the Provincial Fiscal of Rizal and Department of Justice prosecutors involving different amounts, vouchers, and supplies (Cases Nos. 13202-13221 and 13740-13754) [3]. Petitioners filed an original action for prohibition with preliminary injunction before the Supreme Court to enjoin the respondent Judge and prosecutors from proceeding with the trials and filing further cases [4]. They alleged that the offenses were "connected and united," that the prosecutions constituted harassment and oppression, that they were denied preliminary investigation, and that the recommended bail was excessive [5]. They further argued they faced the danger of double jeopardy [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the writ of prohibition should be issued to enjoin the criminal prosecutions against the petitioners.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court dismissed the petition. The general rule is that a criminal prosecution may not be blocked by court prohibition or injunction [6]. If the investigation of a crime were halted by court order at every turn, the administration of criminal justice would suffer an undue setback (*Hernandez v. Albano*) [7]. While there are exceptions—such as when necessary for the orderly administration of justice or to prevent oppressive exercise of legal authority—the petitioners failed to show their case falls under these exceptions [8, 9].

The Court found that: (1) the bail had already been reduced to P500 per case; (2) the claim of lack of preliminary investigation was denied by respondents and should have been raised before the trial court; and (3) there was no proof of double jeopardy or that the offenses were identical [9, 10]. The records indicated the cases involved different vouchers, amounts, suppliers, and projects, constituting distinct acts of falsification rather than a continuous offense (*People v. Gonzales*) [11, 12]. Furthermore, the respondent Judge was not given the chance to pass upon these questions, and the petition was premature [13].

Petition dismissed; writ prayed for denied; restraining order dissolved and set aside [14].
