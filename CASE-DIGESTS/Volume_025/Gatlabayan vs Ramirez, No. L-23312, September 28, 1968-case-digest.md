I. CAPTION
JULIO GATLABAYAN, ET AL. v. EMILIANO C. RAMIREZ, G.R. Nos. L-23312, L-23313 & L-23314, September 28, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellees (Julio, Bonifacio, and Maximo Gatlabayan) acquired separate lots in Antipolo, Rizal through Homestead Patents [1]. On April 9, 1957, they signed "Agreements to Sell" regarding these lots in favor of defendant-appellant Emiliano C. Ramirez [2]. On January 17, 1958, the parties executed Deeds of Absolute Sale, which were registered on February 13, 1958 [1, 3].

In December 1962 and January 1963, plaintiffs filed separate complaints to redeem the properties under Section 119 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 (Public Land Act), which allows repurchase within five years from the date of conveyance [4]. Ramirez argued that the five-year period should be reckoned from the April 9, 1957 "Agreements to Sell," meaning the period had already expired [2]. He also claimed entitlement to an inflation adjustment under Article 1250 of the Civil Code [5]. The lower court ruled in favor of plaintiffs, ordering reconveyance without fixing a specific redemption period [6, 7]. Ramirez appealed directly to the Supreme Court [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the five-year redemption period under Section 119 of C.A. No. 141 commences from the date of the "Agreement to Sell" (April 9, 1957) or the "Deed of Absolute Sale" (January 17, 1958).
2. W/N the redemption price should be adjusted due to inflation under Article 1250 of the Civil Code.
3. W/N the Court should fix a specific period for the plaintiffs to exercise their right of redemption.

IV. RULING
1. **FROM THE DEED OF ABSOLUTE SALE.** The Court held that the conveyance was actually made on January 17, 1958, not before. The "Agreement to Sell" was by its own terms a mere promise to sell, expressly noting the parties could not yet execute a sale due to the legal prohibition against alienating homesteads within five years of the patent issuance [9]. The agreement stipulated that the purchase price was not to be paid in full and possession would not be transferred until the execution of the absolute deed [9]. Thus, the five-year redemption period is reckoned from the date of the absolute sale [9].

2. **NO.** The Court rejected the application of Article 1250 of the Civil Code. The issue was not raised in the defendant's answer, and there was no evidence of extraordinary inflation [10]. Furthermore, Article 1250 applies only when the contract provides for payment in a specific "currency stipulated," which was not the case here [10]. Plaintiffs cannot be made to suffer for the difference in purchasing power caused by the defendant's unlawful refusal to allow redemption [10].

3. **YES.** The Court ruled that leaving the decision open would create uncertainty as to whether the right could be enforced within the ten-year prescription period for court decisions [7]. In the interest of justice and fair play, a reasonable period must be fixed [11].

**Disposition:** The decision is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Plaintiffs are granted a period of 60 days from notice of entry of judgment to exercise their right of redemption [11].
