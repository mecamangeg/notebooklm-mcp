I. CAPTION
GUARDIANSHIP OF THE INCOMPETENT FEDERICO GARLIT; PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. ERLINDA G. GARLIT, G.R. No. L-22504, October 14, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Philippine National Bank (PNB), appointed as guardian of the incompetent veteran Federico Garlit under Republic Act No. 390 (Uniform Veterans Guardianship Act), petitioned the Court of First Instance of Tarlac to invest P15,000.00 of the ward's funds in 7% government Socio-Economic Bonds [1]. The ward's wife, Erlinda Garlit, opposed the petition and proposed investing the funds in productive agricultural land instead, claiming it would be more profitable [1]. Despite objections from PNB and the U.S. Veterans Administration that such purchase was not sanctioned by law, the lower court ordered PNB to purchase the agricultural land offered by a certain Luis Tan [1, 2]. PNB appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the investment of the ward's trust funds in agricultural lands is authorized under Republic Act No. 390.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that under Section 21(a) of R.A. No. 390, the court may authorize the purchase of real estate by the guardian only in three specific instances: (1) as a home for the ward, (2) to protect his interest, or (3) as a home for his dependent family (if he is not a minor) [3, 4]. The subject agricultural land was not intended for a home but as a source of income [5]. Furthermore, the provision allowing purchase to "protect his interest" requires the ward to have an existing right in the property prior to the purchase, such as in cases of foreclosure or partition, which was not the case here [5, 6]. Conversely, the purchase of 7% Socio-Economic Bonds is expressly authorized under Section 16 of R.A. No. 390 and is more advantageous than the ward's current savings deposit [7, 8].

The orders appealed from are set aside, and the guardian-appellant is authorized to invest P15,000.00 in Socio-Economic Bonds [8].
