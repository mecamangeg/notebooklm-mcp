I. CAPTION
In re: Disbarment Proceedings Against Notary Public Atty. Zacarias Manigbas, Adm. Case No. 501, October 26, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Zacarias Manigbas, a lawyer and Notary Public for the Rural Bank of Lucena, was charged with falsification under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code. He notarized loan documents making it appear that they were subscribed and signed by one Pablo de la Cruz before him in Lucena City, when in truth, they were signed in Manila and not in his presence [1]. During the Solicitor General's investigation, the respondent admitted that he did not exercise utmost care in verifying the identity of the signatory [2]. He relied merely on the assumption that the papers were in order because they had been processed by the bank manager [3]. The Solicitor General found no evidence that the respondent was involved in the bank's fraudulent loan scheme and recommended that he be exonerated from the falsification charge but warned for his negligence, citing the similar case of *Ramirez v. Ner* [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent should be disbarred for notarizing documents without the presence of the affiant.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court adopted the Solicitor General's recommendation, ruling that while the respondent failed to exercise "utmost care" in ascertaining the identity of the person acknowledging documents before him, this negligence does not warrant disbarment [5, 6]. The Court accepted the finding that the respondent was not part of the fraud and relied on the doctrine in *Ramirez v. Ner* (Adm. Case No. 500), which held that notarizing a document without the presence of the party is not serious enough to justify disbarment or suspension [5].

Respondent is **WARNED** to be more careful in the future in the performance of his duties as Notary Public, and that any well-grounded complaint in the future upon similar grounds will merit a stiffer penalty [6].
