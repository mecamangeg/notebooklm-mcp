I. CAPTION
TIDEWATER OIL COMPANY v. ADELAIDA C. DIONISIO, FORTUNATO DIONISIO and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-25888, October 29, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Adelaida and Fortunato Dionisio, owners of a gasoline station in Makati, executed a 15-year lease contract with petitioner Tidewater Oil Company on August 20, 1959. The contract stipulated a rental of P0.0075 per liter of gasoline sold through the pumps, with a minimum of P1.00 per month. Adelaida Dionisio simultaneously operated the station as a dealer under a separate "Associated Dealer's Sales Contract." On September 30, 1961, the parties signed a "termination of agreements" explicitly cancelling the dealership contract and a previous lease-back agreement, but the document did not mention the August 20, 1959 lease. Dionisio ceased to be a dealer, and the station was subsequently operated by third parties.

When Tidewater sought to extrajudicially foreclose a mortgage on Dionisio's property for unpaid debts, Dionisio filed a complaint to rescind the 1959 lease contract. The Trial Court ruled in favor of Dionisio, holding that the "termination of agreements" impliedly included the lease. The Court of Appeals affirmed the rescission but on the ground that the lease became void for lack of cause (consideration) once Dionisio ceased to be the dealer, viewing the rental payments as merely a rebate.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lease contract of August 20, 1959 was terminated by the "termination of agreements" executed on September 30, 1961.
2. W/N the lease contract became void for lack of cause or consideration after the respondent ceased to be a dealer.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The "termination of agreements" document was clear and restrictive. It specifically enumerated the contracts being terminated (the dealership and an earlier lease-back) and included the phrase "but none others." The Supreme Court held that the lower court erred in extending the scope of the termination beyond the limits defined by the parties themselves.

2. **NO.** The lease contract was a separate and independent agreement from the dealership contract. The stipulated rental of P0.0075 per liter was a valid consideration based on the volume of sales, regardless of who operated the station, and was not merely a rebate or discount for the dealer. The contract expressly allowed Tidewater to sublease the property without the lessor's consent, implying the lease would subsist even if Dionisio was not the operator. Furthermore, the minimum rental of P1.00 guarded against contingencies where operations might be suspended. The Court ruled that the fact that a bargain is a hard one or that the results are not as expected is not a sufficient ground for cancellation of a contract entered into by parties capable of independent judgment (*Askay v. Cosalan*).

The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed; the complaint is dismissed and the writ of injunction set aside.
