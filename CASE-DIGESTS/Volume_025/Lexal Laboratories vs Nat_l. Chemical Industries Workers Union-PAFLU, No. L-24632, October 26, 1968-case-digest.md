I. CAPTION
LEXAL LABORATORIES and/or JOSE ANGELES, Manager v. NATIONAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES WORKERS UNION-PAFLU (Lexal Laboratories Chapter) and THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-24632, October 26, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Guillermo Ponseca, an employee of Lexal Laboratories (Lexal), was dismissed from service. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled in his favor, ordering his reinstatement with "full back wages" [1]. In implementing the decision, the CIR calculated Ponseca's back wages to include his daily wage of P4.50 plus a *per diem* of P4.00 for the days he was "supposed" to be working in the provinces, totaling P8.50/day for those periods [2]. Lexal objected to the inclusion of the *per diem*, arguing that Ponseca remained in Manila during the entire period of his dismissal and did not incur expenses for meals and lodging that *per diems* are meant to reimburse [3]. The CIR overruled the objection, holding that *per diems* were paid "regularly" and thus part of back wages [3]. Lexal appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N *per diems* should be included in the computation of back wages.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that *per diems* are not part of back wages. A *per diem* is defined as a daily allowance intended to cover the cost of lodging and subsistence for an officer or employee while on duty outside their permanent station [4]. It is in the nature of a reimbursement [4]. Since Ponseca did not leave Manila during the period of his dismissal, he spent nothing on extra meals and lodging; therefore, there is nothing to reimburse [4].

Furthermore, "back wages" represent what an employee has lost "in the way of wages" due to dismissal [5]. As Ponseca earned P4.50 a day, that is the specific amount he lost daily, "nothing more nothing less" [5]. The Court cited *Donato v. Philippine Marine Officers Association* to support the principle that back wages are strictly compensatory for lost earnings, not allowances for expenses not incurred [5].

The petition was granted. The CIR Order and Resolution were modified to exclude *per diems*, and Lexal Laboratories was ordered to pay Ponseca a net backpay of P2,697.00 [6].
