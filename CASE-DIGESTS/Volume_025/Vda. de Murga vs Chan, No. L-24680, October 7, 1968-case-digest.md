I. CAPTION
JESUSA VDA. DE MURGA v. JUANITO CHAN, G.R. No. L-24680, October 7, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jesusa Vda. de Murga leased two parcels of land in Zamboanga City to Respondent Juanito Chan for a ten-year term expiring on January 31, 1959. The contract contained Clause 7, stating that upon expiration, the lessor had the option to purchase the lessee's improvements; otherwise, the "contract of lease shall be automatically renewed," with the period and rental to be adjusted by the parties.

Upon expiration, the parties failed to agree on a renewal. On February 19, 1959, the Petitioner sent a letter demanding the Respondent to vacate *unless* he paid a new increased rental of P600.00 or P700.00 (compared to the original P500.00). The Respondent chose to stay and tendered the original rental, insisting on the automatic renewal clause. The Petitioner rejected the payment and filed a complaint for unlawful detainer in the Municipal Court. The Municipal Court and subsequently the Court of First Instance ruled in favor of the Petitioner, ordering the Respondent to vacate. The Respondent appealed, questioning the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court and the sufficiency of the cause of action.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the demand letter giving the lessee the option to pay increased rent or vacate is sufficient to constitute a cause of action for unlawful detainer.
2. W/N the Municipal Court had jurisdiction over the case which hinged on the interpretation of the "automatic renewal" clause.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A notice giving the lessee the alternative either to pay the increased rental or otherwise to vacate the land is not the demand contemplated by the Rules of Court in unlawful detainer cases. Under the ruling in *Manotok v. Guinto*, when the lessee elects to stay after such notice, he merely assumes the new rental and cannot be ejected until he defaults in said obligation and a necessary *definite* demand to vacate is subsequently made. In this case, the demand was conditional and not definite; thus, the lessee did not incur in default giving rise to an action for unlawful detainer [1], [2].

2. **NO.** The pleadings showed that the "jugular vein" of the controversy was the correct interpretation of Clause 7 of the lease contract—specifically, whether it contemplated an automatic renewal. An action hinging on the interpretation of a contract clause is one not capable of pecuniary estimation and is therefore beyond the competence of the Municipal Court. Citing *Cruz v. Alberto* and *Legarda Koh v. Ongsiaco*, the Court held that "extendible" or "automatically renewed" standing without qualification is a unilateral stipulation obliging the promisor to fulfill the promise to extend, and any uncertainty is construed in favor of the tenant [3], [4], [5].

Accordingly, the decision is SET ASIDE and REVERSED.
