I. CAPTION
NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION v. HON. FRANCISCO ARCA, PHILIPPINE POWER & DEVELOPMENT COMPANY and DAGUPAN ELECTRIC CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-23309, October 31, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On December 26, 1963, respondents Philippine Power & Development Company and Dagupan Electric Corporation filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to enjoin petitioner National Power Corporation (NPC) from enforcing a revised rate schedule effective January 1, 1964 [1]. Respondents alleged the new rates, increasing costs by 24% to 30%, were unreasonable, violated their existing contracts, and lacked the necessary approval from the Public Service Commission (PSC) [2]. The CFI issued a preliminary injunction [3]. NPC moved to dismiss the case and dissolve the injunction, arguing that under Republic Act No. 2677, the authority to review rates belonged to the PSC, depriving the court of jurisdiction [3]. The CFI denied NPC's motions, prompting NPC to file a petition for certiorari alleging grave abuse of discretion [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Public Service Commission (PSC) has jurisdiction to revise the rates charged by the National Power Corporation (NPC).
2. W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction to issue an injunction against the NPC.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The authority to fix rates belongs to the NPC, not the PSC. Section 2(g) of Commonwealth Act No. 120, the NPC's charter, specifically provides that rates fixed by the NPC "shall not be subject to revision by the Public Service Commission" [5], [6]. Although Republic Act No. 2677 amended the Public Service Act to grant the PSC jurisdiction over government-owned corporations, it is a general law. It did not repeal the specific exemption provided in C.A. 120, a special law, because a general law does not repeal a prior special law unless the legislative intent to do so is manifest [6], [7].

2. **YES.** Even assuming the PSC had jurisdiction, the respondents were entitled to seek judicial relief because the NPC attempted to enforce rates that had not been authorized by the PSC [8]. Since the PSC is an administrative body with limited functions and cannot grant injunctive relief, the lower court properly exercised its jurisdiction to enjoin the enforcement of the challenged rates [9].

The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied, and the preliminary injunction heretofore issued is dissolved [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Concepcion, Dizon, Makalintal, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, Fernando, and Capistrano concurred. Justice Zaldivar did not take part [11].
