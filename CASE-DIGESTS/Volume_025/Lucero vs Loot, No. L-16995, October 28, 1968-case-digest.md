I. CAPTION
JULIO LUCERO v. JAIME L. LOOT, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16995, October 28, 1968, 25 SCRA 687, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Julio Lucero obtained a final decree in a land registration case on October 29, 1941, stemming from a decision promulgated in 1938. In September 1959, Lucero filed a motion for a writ of possession with the Court of First Instance of Iloilo. Oppositors Jaime Loot, et al. challenged the motion, alleging defects in the reconstitution of records and that the motion was not under oath. They also argued that a separate case for reconveyance was pending between the parties.

The trial court granted the writ of possession, ruling that the issuance is a matter of course after a final decree and is not subject to prescription. Loot filed multiple motions for reconsideration and to quash, which were denied. Loot then appealed directly to the Supreme Court, raising twenty-one errors, largely factual.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the right to demand a writ of possession prescribes.
2. W/N the pendency of an action for reconveyance bars the issuance of a writ of possession.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that there is no period of prescription as to the issuance of a writ of possession. Under the Land Registration Act (Act No. 496), once a final decree has been issued, the writ of possession is a matter of course if none has been issued previously in favor of the registered owner. Citing *Soroñgon v. Makalintal*, the Court reiterated that the purpose of the writ is to place the successful litigant in possession, avoiding the delay and inconvenience of commencing new actions. The writ may be issued against any person adversely occupying the land during the proceedings up to the issuance of the final decree (*Demorar v. Ibañez*).

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the mere pendency of a suit for reconveyance does not oust the trial court of its jurisdiction to issue a writ of possession. Relying on *Agreda v. Rodriguez*, the Court affirmed that the institution of a civil case for reconveyance is a matter that does not affect the jurisdiction of the registration court to issue the writ.

The orders granting the writ of possession and denying reconsideration were affirmed.
