I. CAPTION
JOSE L. LACHICA and the LIBERAL PARTY v. HON. JUAN E. YAP, SERGIO ABESAMES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25379, September 25, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jose L. Lachica, the Liberal Party candidate for Congressman in the Second District of Sorsogon, filed a petition for certiorari to nullify the order of respondent Judge Juan E. Yap. The assailed order denied Lachica's petition for a judicial recount of ballots in specific precincts in Bacon, Casiguran, and Sorsogon. Lachica also sought to declare the proclamation of the rival Nacionalista Party candidate, Vicente L. Peralta, null and void.

While the case was pending, Peralta manifested that he had already been proclaimed, took his oath of office on December 30, 1965, and had assumed the duties of a duly elected Congressman. Peralta argued the petition had become moot. Petitioners insisted that the Supreme Court should still rule on the merits of the petition regarding the judicial recount despite the proclamation and assumption of office.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court retains jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of a CFI order denying a judicial recount after the winning candidate has been proclaimed, taken his oath, and assumed office as a Member of the House of Representatives.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court's jurisdiction ceases upon the candidate's assumption of office. The Court held that under Section 11, Article VI of the Constitution, the Electoral Tribunal is the "sole judge of all contests relating to the election returns, and qualifications of their respective Members."

The Court cited *Angara v. Electoral Commission*, reaffirming that the power of the Electoral Tribunal is intended to be "full, clear and complete," excluding the exercise of authority by the Supreme Court that would restrict or curtail it. While the Court could validly pass on the lower court's order *prior* to the proclamation, the situation changes once the candidate is proclaimed, takes his oath, and assumes office. At that stage, the determination of the contest properly and exclusively pertains to the Electoral Tribunal. To rule otherwise would result in "unseemly wrangling" between the Court and the Constitutional agency.

The petition is **DENIED**.
