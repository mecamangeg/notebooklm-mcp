I. CAPTION
ANOTA and ANOTA v. BERMUDO, JR., ET AL., G.R. No. L-29417, September 21, 1968, 25 SCRA 53, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Anota filed an action for partition of Cadastral Lot No. 2274 against respondents Bermudo, et al. in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. On April 5, 1965, the CFI rendered a decision ordering the partition of the lot and requiring the parties to submit a project of partition. Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration on May 14, 1965, which was denied on July 26, 1965. Subsequently, they filed a notice of appeal on August 7, 1967.

The Court of Appeals (CA) dismissed the petitioners' appeal because the record on appeal failed to show on its face the data indicating that the appeal was perfected on time. Specifically, the record did not state the dates when the petitioners received the notice of the April 5 decision or the notice of the July 26 order denying the reconsideration. Petitioners filed a petition for review by certiorari challenging the CA's dismissal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Appeals correctly dismissed the appeal for failure of the record on appeal to show that the appeal was perfected on time.
2. W/N the trial court's decision ordering partition is a final and appealable judgment.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of Appeals correctly dismissed the appeal. The record on appeal did not show upon its face the date when petitioners received notice of the trial court's decision or the order denying the motion for reconsideration [1, 2]. These dates are indispensable for the proper computation of the appeal period to determine if the appeal was perfected on time [1].

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court noted that the trial court's decision was interlocutory and not final in character because it ordered the partition of land and required the submission of a project of partition [3]. Citing *Fuentebella v. Carascoso* and Section 7, Rule 69 of the Rules of Court, the Court ruled that such a decision is not appealable until the filing and approval of the project of partition and the rendition of final judgment thereon [3, 4].

Petition dismissed [5, 6].
