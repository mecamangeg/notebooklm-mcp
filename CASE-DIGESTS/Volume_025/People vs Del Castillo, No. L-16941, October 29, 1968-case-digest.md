I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MATEO DEL CASTILLO, ET AL., defendants; JOSE ESTRADA, defendant-appellant, G.R. No. L-16941, October 29, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On February 27, 1956, Elvira Tañada de Principe was kidnapped from her store in Gumaca, Quezon by a band of Hukbalahaps led by Lt. Pepe Alcantara. She was detained in the mountains for 18 days and released only after the payment of P50,000.00 ransom. The appellant, Jose Estrada, a municipal councilor of Gumaca, was charged as a principal by inducement. Prosecution witnesses, including co-accused turned state witnesses Antonio Campaniero and Julio Ceribo, testified that prior to the crime, Estrada conferred with Alcantara in Barrio Biga. When asked for a suitable victim, Estrada suggested the Principe family and specifically pinpointed Elvira, explaining that she would be easier to ransom than her husband, whose properties were in his own name. Estrada assured the kidnappers of his cooperation. The Court of First Instance of Quezon found Estrada guilty of kidnapping for ransom with the aggravating circumstance of abuse of public office and sentenced him to death. Estrada appealed, questioning the credibility of the witnesses and alleging due process violations.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the testimonies of the co-accused turned state witnesses are credible.
2. W/N the prosecution suppressed evidence by failing to produce the Huk leader, Lt. Alcantara.
3. W/N the trial court denied due process by refusing to recall a prosecution witness for the defense.
4. W/N the appellant is liable as a principal by inducement.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The witnesses' credibility remains intact despite the promise of discharge from the information. The Court noted that the witnesses withstood "extraordinarily long and searching cross-examinations" by defense counsel without falling into serious contradictions, which would be expected if they were fabricating lies. Their testimonies were straightforward and satisfactory. Alleged retraction letters were disregarded as the Court found they were the result of coercion and insidious attempts to tamper with the witnesses.

2. **NO.** The charge of suppression of evidence is without merit. The prosecutor acted as a special prosecutor under the Department of Justice, not as an Army officer, and there was no evidence he influenced superiors to disobey court orders. The record showed that Lt. Alcantara was still "in the field" and his whereabouts were unknown, making his production impossible.

3. **NO.** Section 14, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court provides that the court may grant or withhold leave to recall a witness in its discretion. The Supreme Court held that the trial court exercised proper caution in denying the recall of witness Ceribo, as the record was "loaded with circumstances tending to show insidious attempts to tamper with the witnesses for the prosecution."

4. **YES.** Estrada is liable as a principal by inducement because his suggestion was the "efficacious inducement" that led the Huks to proceed with the crime. The Court found that Estrada enjoyed an "ascendancy of the mind" over Lt. Alcantara. His specific suggestion to kidnap Elvira, backed by the reasoning that her family could easily pay the ransom, was the determining cause of the commission of the offense. One who induces another to commit a crime is a principal if the inducement is the determining cause.

Decision affirmed with modification.
