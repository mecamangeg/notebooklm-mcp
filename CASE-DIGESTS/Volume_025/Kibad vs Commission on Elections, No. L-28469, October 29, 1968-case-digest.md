I. CAPTION
UNA KIBAD v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF TUBARAN, LANAO DEL SUR, and ABDULMADID MARUHOM PANON-DIONGAN, G.R. No. L-28469, October 29, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Kibad filed a petition for mandamus with preliminary injunction regarding the mayoral election results in Tubaran, Lanao del Sur. On December 29, 1967, the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining the Municipal Board of Canvassers from proclaiming a mayor [1]. On April 23, 1968, Kibad filed a motion for contempt, alleging that Respondent Panondiongan had forcibly assumed the office of Mayor on March 22, 1968, without benefit of proclamation and with the aid of the Philippine Constabulary, thereby defying the TRO [2], [3]. The Court denied the main mandamus petition on May 7, 1968, but without prejudice to the resolution of the contempt motion [3]. In his "Explanation" filed on June 25, 1968, Panondiongan admitted assuming office despite the standing TRO. He argued his actions were not intended to disobey the Court but were dictated by "public interest" and the "clamor of the people" due to the alleged neglect of the hold-over mayor (Kibad) and a rise in criminality [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent Panondiongan is liable for contempt of court for assuming office despite the existence of a Supreme Court restraining order.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that while the respondent's explanation provided a reason for his acts, it certainly could not justify them [6]. As long as the restraining order was in full force and effect, Panondiongan had a clear and unavoidable obligation to obey it, not evade or disregard it [7].

The Court ruled that if the public interest demanded action due to the alleged rise in criminality, the proper step was to seek a dissolution or modification of the restraining order, rather than defying it [6]. Citing *Philippine Association of Free Labor Unions v. Salvador*, the Court emphasized that parties have no alternative but to submit to judicial orders [8]. The rule of law commands obedience to judicial decrees, and defiance by the highest elective official of a municipality is particularly reprehensible as it brings the law into disrepute [7], [9].

Accordingly, Respondent Abdulmadid Maruhom Panondiongan is fined P1,000.00 for the contempt committed [10].
