**I. CAPTION**
HON. MARTINIANO P. VIVO, as (Acting) Commissioner of Immigration v. HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch VI, CHUA PIC LUAN, UY KOC SIONG and UY TIAN SIONG, G.R. No. L-25411, October 26, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondents Chua Pic Luan and her minor children arrived in the Philippines on October 16, 1960, as temporary visitors with an initial 3-month stay. The husband/father, Uy Pick Tuy, was granted naturalization on April 11, 1961. The Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and Justice purportedly extended the respondents' stay up to April 11, 1963, to coincide with Uy Pick Tuy’s oath-taking, and changed their status to special non-immigrants. Petitioner Commissioner of Immigration refused to recognize this extension beyond June 16, 1962, and ordered them to leave.

Respondents filed a petition for mandamus with injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. After a first petition was dismissed without prejudice, they re-filed. Respondent Judge Cloribel issued an *ex-parte* writ of preliminary injunction on July 24, 1962, restraining the Commissioner from deporting them. In 1965, the Commissioner moved to dismiss the case as moot since the requested extension date had passed, but Judge Cloribel denied the motion. The Commissioner filed this petition for certiorari and prohibition.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and Justice have the authority to extend the stay of temporary visitors or change their status.
2. W/N the alien wife and minor children automatically acquired Filipino citizenship upon the naturalization of the husband/father.
3. W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the injunction and denying the motion to dismiss.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The so-called Cabinet Resolution of February 29, 1956, did not and could not legally authorize the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and Justice to extend the stay of temporary visitors. Under the express provisions of the Immigration Law, the power to grant such extensions is vested in the Commissioner of Immigration (*Lim Chiok v. Vivo*). Furthermore, temporary visitors cannot have their status changed to special non-immigrants without first departing from the country. To rule otherwise would encourage aliens to enter under false pretenses (*Chiong Tiao Bing v. Commissioner of Immigration*).

2. **NO.** An alien woman does not automatically become a Filipino citizen upon her husband's naturalization. She must first prove that she possesses all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications for naturalization (*Lee Suan Ay v. Galang*). Here, the wife misrepresented her intent as a visitor while intending to stay permanently, demonstrating a lack of good moral character. Regarding the minor children, citizenship is extended to them only if they are "dwelling" in the Philippines at the time of the parent's naturalization. "Dwelling" means lawful residence. Since their authorized stay had expired prior to their father's oath-taking, they were no longer lawfully residing in the country (*Vivo v. Cloribel, L-23239*).

3. **YES.** The writ of preliminary injunction was improvidently issued *ex-parte* after the terminal date of stay fixed by the Commissioner (June 16, 1962) had already passed. Furthermore, when the Commissioner filed the motion to dismiss in 1965, the date respondents themselves insisted upon (April 11, 1963) had also long expired. The case was plainly moot, and the Judge's denial of the motion was whimsical, arbitrary, and in open disregard of national policy.

**Petition GRANTED.** The orders granting the preliminary injunction and denying the motion to dismiss are SET ASIDE. The respondent Judge is permanently restrained from taking cognizance of the case except to dismiss it.
