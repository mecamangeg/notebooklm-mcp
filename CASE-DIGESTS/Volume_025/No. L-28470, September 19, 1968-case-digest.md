I. CAPTION
Real Monasterio de la Purisima Concepcion de Nuestra Madre Santa Clara de Manila v. Domingo Fabian, et al., G.R. No. L-28470, September 19, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondents were leasehold tenants of ricelands in Pampanga owned by Elena Pecson [1]. On August 4, 1964, Pecson executed a Deed of Absolute Sale conveying the properties to petitioner Real Monasterio (the Corporation), which was registered and resulted in the issuance of a new title in the petitioner's name [2, 3]. The tenants were not notified of this sale [2]. Previously, in 1963, Pecson had executed deeds of donation favoring the petitioner, but these were never registered [4, 5].

On September 21, 1964, the tenants formally demanded to exercise their right of legal redemption under the Agricultural Land Reform Code [2]. Subsequently, in November 1964, Pecson and the petitioner executed a "Revocation of Deed of Absolute Sale," reverting the title to Pecson [3]. The tenants filed suit to exercise redemption. The Court of Agrarian Relations dismissed the case, ruling that the right to redeem was extinguished when the property was restored to the original owner [6]. The Court of Appeals reversed this decision, declaring the revocation void as against public policy and upholding the tenants' right to redeem [7, 8]. Petitioner appealed, arguing the transaction was primarily a donation and the sale was simulated [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the tenants may exercise the right of redemption despite the subsequent revocation of the deed of sale.
2. W/N the tenants are entitled to redeem the entire landholding even if it exceeds the area they actually cultivate.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the deed of revocation is not conclusive upon the tenants, who were not parties to it, nor are courts bound to accept it at face value [10]. The Court affirmed the findings that the revocation, executed only *after* the tenants asserted their right to redeem, was intended to defeat said right [11]. The Court noted that the parties registered the sale and transferred title, while the alleged donation remained unregistered, indicating the sale was the operative transaction [12]. The intention of the parties is a question of fact, and the lower court's finding that the revocation was unworthy of credence is binding [10, 13].

2. **YES.** Section 12 of R.A. No. 3844 explicitly mandates that the "entire landholding must be redeemed" [14]. The proviso limiting a lessee's right to the area actually cultivated is intended solely to forestall conflicts *between* lessees and does not restrict the right of redemption against the vendor or vendee [14]. Any issue regarding the division of excess area is a matter to be settled among the tenants themselves [15].

The decision of the Court of Appeals was **AFFIRMED**, but the case was **REMANDED** to the trial court to determine the reasonable price of redemption [16].
