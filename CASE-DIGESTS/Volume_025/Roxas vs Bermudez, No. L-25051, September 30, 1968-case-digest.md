I. CAPTION
**JOSE B. ROXAS and VENANCIA B. ROXAS v. PEDRO BERMUDEZ, DOMINGA MARTIN and MR. & MRS. LORETA BERMUDEZ**, G.R. No. L-25051, September 30, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
In 1957, Pedro and Loreta Bermudez filed Civil Case No. 34498 against spouses Joaquin and Estela Andrade and spouses Jose and Venancia Roxas. They alleged that the Andrades, through fraud, tricked their mother Dominga Martin into adjudicating a lot inherited from their father to herself and selling it to the Andrades, who then sold it to the Roxas spouses. Dominga Martin intervened, supporting the plaintiffs' claim of fraud. The trial court dismissed the complaint and intervention, finding no fraud and affirming the Roxas spouses' valid title. This decision became final in 1963 after the appeal was dismissed.

Subsequently, the Roxas spouses filed Civil Case No. 53732 against the Bermudezes and Martin to recover possession of the subject land. The defendants answered, claiming ownership and reiterating the defense of fraud by the Andrades. They also sought to file a third-party complaint against the Andrades. The trial court ruled that the decision in the first case constituted *res judicata*, declared the Roxas spouses as owners, ordered the defendants to vacate, and denied the third-party complaint.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the decision in Civil Case No. 34498 constitutes *res judicata* to the present action for recovery of possession.
2. W/N the trial court erred in denying the admission of the third-party complaint.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the requisites of *res judicata* were present: the court in the prior case had jurisdiction, the judgment was on the merits, and it had become final. Although the first case was primarily for damages and the present case is for recovery of possession, the issue of ownership was intricately involved and definitively resolved in the first case. The Court applied the rule that a fact or question material to the determination of both actions (validity of the sale and ownership), once adjudicated, is conclusive in a subsequent suit between the same parties, even if the cause of action is different (*Samahan Magsasaka, Inc. v. Chua Guan*).

2. **NO.** The allegations in the third-party complaint were mere reiterations of the arguments regarding fraud and deceit raised in Civil Case No. 34498. Since the trial court in the prior case had already resolved the issue of ownership and the validity of the transactions adversely against the defendants, admitting the third-party complaint would be superfluous.

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
