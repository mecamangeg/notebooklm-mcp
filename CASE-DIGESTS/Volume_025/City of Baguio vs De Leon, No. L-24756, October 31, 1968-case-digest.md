I. CAPTION
CITY OF BAGUIO v. FORTUNATO DE LEON, G.R. No. L-24756, October 31, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
The City Attorney of Baguio filed a complaint in the City Court against Fortunato De Leon for his failure to pay P300 in license fees covering the period from 1958 to 1962 [1]. The fees were imposed by Ordinance No. 218 on real estate dealers; De Leon was held liable as a dealer with property in Baguio worth between P10,000 and P50,000 [1]. De Leon admitted earning rental income but challenged the jurisdiction of the City Court, arguing that because he raised the issue of the ordinance's constitutionality, the case fell under the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance [2]. He further argued that the ordinance was *ultra vires*, constituted double taxation, violated the rule on uniformity, and that the City Treasurer lacked authority to institute the suit without the Mayor's consent [3-5]. The lower court upheld the validity of the ordinance and De Leon's liability [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City Court has jurisdiction over the collection suit despite the constitutional issue raised.
2. W/N Ordinance No. 218 is valid and within the City's power to enact.
3. W/N the ordinance is unconstitutional for imposing double taxation and violating the rule on uniformity.
4. W/N the City Treasurer had authority to institute the suit without the Mayor's specific consent.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The City Court has jurisdiction because the amount sought (P300) falls within its jurisdiction [2]. The mere fact that the constitutionality of the ordinance is raised as a defense does not oust the City Court of its jurisdiction [7, 8]. As an entity possessed of judicial power, the City Court is competent to ascertain facts and apply the law, including the Constitution, which supersedes conflicting statutes [7, 9].

2. **YES.** Republic Act No. 329 amended the City Charter of Baguio (Section 2553 of the Revised Administrative Code) on July 15, 1948, expressly adding the "power to tax" to the city's previous power to license and regulate businesses [10-13]. Consequently, the enactment of Ordinance No. 218 is not *ultra vires* [14].

3. **NO.** There is no violation of due process as double taxation is not prohibited where one tax is imposed by the national government and the other by the city [15-17]. Furthermore, the ordinance satisfies the rule on uniformity because it applies equally to all persons placed in a similar situation [18, 19]. The classification of tax rates based on property value brackets (e.g., P50 fee for property worth P10,000–P50,000) is reasonable and does not infringe on constitutional limitations [20, 21].

4. **YES.** The act of the City Treasurer is presumptively the act of the City Mayor unless repudiated or set aside [11, 22]. This applies the principle that the act of a department head is presumptively the act of the Chief Executive performed within the limits of their authority [5].

The decision of the lower court is AFFIRMED [23].
