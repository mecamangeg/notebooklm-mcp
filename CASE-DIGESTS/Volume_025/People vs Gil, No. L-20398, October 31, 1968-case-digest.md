I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JUAN GIL, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20398, October 31, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Defendants Juan Gil, Angel Cabiugin, and Gerardo Limpiado were charged with defamation under Article 358 of the Revised Penal Code by offended parties Jose Malingit and Tranquilino O. Calo, Jr. [1]. The cases originated in the Justice of the Peace Court of Nasipit, Agusan, and were elevated to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan where separate informations were filed [1]. The defendants pleaded not guilty, and the cases were set for joint trial [1].

However, the trial court *motu proprio* raised the issue that since the alleged slanderous acts were uttered on the same date and place, there should have been only one information, even if directed against two different persons [1]. Consequently, the trial court dismissed Criminal Case No. 2156 (pertaining to one victim) to avoid multiplicity of prosecutions but allowed Criminal Case No. 2153 to proceed [1, 2]. The State appealed the order of dismissal [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N slanderous utterances committed on the same date and place against two different persons constitute a single offense.
2. W/N the State's appeal of the dismissal violates the defendants' right against double jeopardy.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that where slanderous utterances are committed on the same date and place but against two different persons, the situation gives rise to two separate and individual causes for prosecution [2, 4]. Citing *People vs. Del Rosario* (G.R. No. L-2254), the Court ruled that there are as many offenses as there are persons defamed [2]. Therefore, the trial court erred in dismissing one of the informations on the mistaken belief that it was necessary to avoid multiplicity of prosecutions [2, 4].

2. **YES.** Despite the trial court's error, the appeal cannot prosper because the dismissal of the prior information occurred after the defendants had already pleaded not guilty and was not done at the instance of the defendants themselves [2, 5, 6]. The Court held that such a dismissal, although erroneous, is sufficient to bar further prosecution for the offense charged [2, 6]. To reverse the order and reinstate the case would constitute double jeopardy, citing *People vs. Borja* (43 Phil. 618) and *People vs. Hernandez* (49 O.G. 5342) [2].

Appeal dismissed [7].
