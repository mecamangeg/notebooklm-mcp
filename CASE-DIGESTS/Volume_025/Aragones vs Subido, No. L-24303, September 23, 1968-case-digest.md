I. CAPTION
BEATRIZ C. ARAGONES, ET AL. v. ABELARDO SUBIDO, Acting Civil Service Commissioner, G.R. No. L-24303, September 23, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, comprising 63 civil service eligibles (CPAs and lawyers), were extended permanent appointments as auditors by the Auditor General. Respondent Acting Civil Service Commissioner Subido refused to attest to these appointments as permanent, approving them only as "provisional" on the ground that lawyers were ineligible for the positions. Respondent also scheduled qualifying examinations for auditors. Petitioners filed a petition for Mandamus and Prohibition with Preliminary Injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to compel the attestation of their permanent appointments and to enjoin the scheduled examinations.

During the pendency of the case, Respondent issued a Memorandum Circular allowing the permanent appointments of incumbents like the petitioners but requiring exams for future promotions. Consequently, the CFI dismissed the case as moot. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the legal issue regarding the Auditor General's authority to appoint versus the Civil Service Commissioner's authority to attest remained unresolved, and that they were entitled to attorney's fees. Meanwhile, the examinations sought to be enjoined were actually conducted on February 28, 1965.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition was properly dismissed for being moot and academic.
2. W/N the petitioners are entitled to attorney's fees.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the case had become moot because the Respondent had already recognized the petitioners' permanent appointments, thereby removing the justiciable controversy. Regarding the prayer to enjoin the examinations, the Court noted that the exams were actually conducted on February 28, 1965. The Court applied the principle that when events sought to be prevented by injunction or prohibition have already happened, nothing more can be enjoined or prohibited (*Manila Railroad Company v. Yatco*). The Court refused to decide on the theoretical issue of the Auditor General's authority, adhering to the rule that courts cannot furnish answers to purposeless questions that do not exist (*Remonte v. Bonto*).

2. **NO.** The Court held that the award of attorney's fees is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. Since the main reason for the suit had ceased to exist, all incidents relative thereto, including the prayer for attorney's fees, were considered *ipso facto* extinguished (*Urdaneta Rural Bank v. San Juan*).

Orders affirmed.
