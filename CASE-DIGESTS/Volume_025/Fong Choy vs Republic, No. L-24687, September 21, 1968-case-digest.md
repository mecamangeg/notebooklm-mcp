I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, FONG CHOY, also known as CARLOS YEE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-24687, September 21, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Fong Choy, also known as Carlos Yee, filed a petition for naturalization as a Filipino citizen. During the hearing, he admitted that he had previously been fined P25.00 for a violation of the Price Tag Law. He explained that the articles in his store were properly tagged, but one tag accidentally fell off, and he paid the fine merely to avoid a troublesome court proceeding [1]. Despite the Republic's opposition arguing that this violation demonstrated a failure to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner, the Court of First Instance of Manila granted the petition on March 24, 1965, finding no impediment to his naturalization [2, 3]. The Republic appealed the decision to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner’s conviction for violation of the Price Tag Law disqualifies him from naturalization for failure to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. Relying on the doctrine of *stare decisis*, the Court applied the precedent set in *Tio Tek Chai v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-19112, October 30, 1964), which held that a violation of the Price Tag Law "certainly renders [an applicant's] conduct anything but proper and irreproachable" [4, 5]. The Court emphasized that the lower court had no power to overrule binding jurisprudence and committed substantial legal error by ignoring it [5, 6]. Furthermore, the Court found the petitioner's explanation—that he pleaded guilty simply to avoid trouble—unworthy of credence and noted that, if true, it betrayed an unseemly lack of faith in the administration of justice [7]. Strict compliance with the requisites of the law is indispensable for the acquisition of citizenship [8].

The decision of the lower court naturalizing the petitioner is reversed [9].
