I. CAPTION
PACIFIC TUG & SALVAGE CORPORATION OF PANAMA v. HON. RAMON O. NOLASCO, Judge of Branch IX, Court of First Instance of Manila; MACARIO M. OFILADA, in his capacity as Ex-Oficio Sheriff of Manila and BANK OF AMERICA NATIONAL TRUST & SAVINGS ASSOCIATION, G.R. No. L-22226, October 14, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pacific Tug & Salvage Corp. was involved in a dispute over the vessel "PACIFIC RESERVE" with respondent Bank of America in Civil Case No. 55484 pending before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, Branch IX, presided by Judge Nolasco [1]. Pacific Tug filed the instant petition with the Supreme Court, which issued a Writ of Preliminary Injunction on May 18, 1964 (later dissolved on July 24, 1968 due to failure to post bond) [2].

During the pendency of the case, Bank of America transferred all its rights over the vessel to Top Service, Inc. on July 24, 1968 [1]. Top Service, Inc. substituted Bank of America in the CFI case with Pacific Tug's conformity [3]. Consequently, the parties agreed to resolve their dispute in the pending CFI case and filed a "Joint Manifestation and Petition to Dismiss" with the Supreme Court on October 1, 1968, stating that the petitioner was no longer interested in prosecuting the current petition [2, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition should be dismissed based on the joint manifestation of the parties.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court granted the joint motion to dismiss. The Court held that since the petitioner and the respondent's transferee agreed to have their dispute resolved and decided in the case pending before the Court of First Instance of Manila, the petitioner is no longer interested in prosecuting the instant case before the Supreme Court [2, 5]. The dismissal included claims of whatever nature which each party may have against the other in the instant petition [6].

The petition was **DISMISSED** without pronouncement as to costs [7].
