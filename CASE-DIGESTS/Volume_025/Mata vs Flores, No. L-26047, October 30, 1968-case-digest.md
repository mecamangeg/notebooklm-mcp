I. CAPTION
DONATO MATA v. HON. DELFIN B. FLORES, PETRA CORPUZ DE MARIANO, and JULIAN MARIANO, No. L-26047, October 30, 1968, 25 SCRA 876, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Mata filed a civil case against the private respondents (the Marianos) for the recovery of five parcels of land. The Marianos were summoned on October 27, 1965, but mailed their answer on November 12, 1965—one day late—having overlooked that October consists of 31 days. Consequently, they were declared in default, and a judgment was rendered in favor of Mata on January 22, 1966. The Marianos filed a motion for reconsideration (MR). On February 22, 1966, the trial court issued an order stating: "The motion for reconsideration is hereby denied."

Believing the judgment had become final and executory due to the denial of the MR, Mata filed an ex-parte motion for a writ of execution on March 24, 1966. Instead of granting it, respondent Judge Flores issued an order stating that the February 22 order was a mistake; it was intended to deny Mata's *opposition* to the MR, not the MR itself. The Judge allowed the Marianos' answer to be admitted. Mata filed a petition for mandamus to compel the issuance of the writ of execution, arguing the decision was already final.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge had the authority to amend the erroneous order and set aside the default judgment despite the lapse of the period to appeal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the respondent Judge acted within his authority. Under **Rule 135, Section 5(g) of the Rules of Court**, courts have the inherent power to amend and control their processes and orders to make them conformable to law and justice.

The Court found that the February 22 order was the product of a mistake by the Judge or his staff. Since **Rule 38** allows a party to seek relief from a judgment entered through mistake or excusable negligence within 60 days of knowledge and 6 months of entry, a Judge has not only the authority but the duty to grant such relief when the mistake is his own. The Judge's rectification on March 24 was within the prescribed period. Additionally, the Court noted that the Marianos' one-day delay in filing their answer was due to excusable negligence (mistaking October for having 30 days) and that they possessed a meritorious defense involving a 1923 deed of sale, which, if ignored, would cause grave injustice.

The petition was dismissed and the writ prayed for was denied.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
