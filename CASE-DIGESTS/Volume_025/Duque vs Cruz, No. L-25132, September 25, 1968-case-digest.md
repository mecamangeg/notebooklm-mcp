I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO DUQUE, in his capacity as Secretary of the Department of Health v. GAVINA CRUZ and THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, G.R. No. L-25132, September 25, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
The City of Baguio, later substituted by petitioner Secretary of Health Francisco Duque, filed a complaint for injunction against respondents Gavina Cruz and the Director of Lands. The petitioner sought to stop Cruz from constructing on a disputed lot, to remove her improvements, and to order the Director of Lands to cancel her provisional permit, claiming the lot formed part of the Baguio General Hospital reservation set aside by the Philippine Commission in 1908 [1].

Cruz maintained the lot was disposable public land. Stipulated facts showed the land was subdivided in 1920 and approved by the Director of Lands in 1928. Cruz filed a Townsite Sales Application, paid fees, and obtained a permit to build [2]. The Court of First Instance of Baguio City dismissed the complaint, ruling that the Bureau of Lands is the sole agency for land disposition and the petitioner failed to prove the land was part of the reservation [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the 1928 determination by the Director of Lands treating the lot as disposable public land precludes the petitioner's claim that it is a reservation.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the Director of Lands has direct executive control over the survey, classification, and disposition of lands of the public domain, and his decisions on questions of fact are conclusive when approved by the Department Secretary, pursuant to Section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 [5, 6]. Although there was no showing of the Secretary's approval, the Director's decision regarding the land's classification became final as it was rendered in 1928 and was never appealed [7, 8].

The Court emphasized that if a determination made by the Director of Lands could be inquired into after almost four decades, there would be "no stability in property rights," which is demanded by public interest [7, 9]. Furthermore, the petitioner slept on its rights (laches) by failing to protest the classification or the alleged invasion of the reservation for over 30 years until the filing of the complaint in 1961 [10, 11].

The appealed decision is affirmed [11].
