I. CAPTION
RIZAL LIGHT & ICE CO., INC. v. THE MUNICIPALITY OF MORONG, RIZAL and THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (G.R. No. L-20993) / RIZAL LIGHT & ICE CO., INC. v. THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION and MORONG ELECTRIC CO., INC. (G.R. No. L-21221), September 28, 1968, 25 SCRA 285, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rizal Light & Ice Co., Inc. (Rizal Light) was granted a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) in 1949 to operate an electric service in Morong, Rizal. Since 1954, however, Rizal Light failed to comply with Public Service Commission (PSC) directives and CPC conditions regarding service standards. In 1958, the Municipality of Morong filed a petition to revoke Rizal Light’s certificate and franchise due to inefficient service. PSC inspections confirmed the violations. On July 29, 1962, Rizal Light's plant burned down. Consequently, on August 20, 1962, the PSC revoked Rizal Light's CPC and forfeited its franchise (G.R. No. L-20993).

Meanwhile, the Municipality granted a franchise to respondent Morong Electric Co., Inc. (Morong Electric) on May 6, 1962. Morong Electric applied for a CPC on September 10, 1962, although its certificate of incorporation was only issued by the SEC on October 17, 1962. The PSC granted Morong Electric's CPC on March 13, 1963 (G.R. No. L-21221). Petitioner appealed both decisions, arguing: (1) the PSC hearing was conducted by a non-lawyer division chief in excess of jurisdiction; (2) the revocation violated the "protection-of-investment" rule; and (3) Morong Electric’s franchise was void as it had no corporate personality when the franchise was granted.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the delegation of the hearing to a non-lawyer division chief rendered the PSC proceedings void.
2. W/N the revocation of petitioner’s CPC violated the "protection-of-investment" rule.
3. W/N the franchise granted to Morong Electric is void because it was not yet incorporated at the time of the grant.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** While Section 32 of Commonwealth Act No. 146 requires that division chiefs authorized to hear cases must be lawyers, the objection to this delegation is procedural, not jurisdictional. Petitioner raised this objection for the first time on appeal. By failing to interpose a timely objection before the Commission and by actively participating in the hearings conducted by the non-lawyer officer, petitioner is deemed to have waived the procedural defect [1-5].

2. **NO.** The "protection-of-investment" rule is not absolute. It applies only to operators of good standing who comply with laws and regulations. It does not apply where the operator has failed to render adequate and satisfactory service and has violated the conditions of its certificate. Public interest and convenience are the paramount considerations. The evidence showed petitioner’s contumacious refusal to comply with PSC directives since 1954 and the deterioration of its service, warranting the revocation of its CPC under Section 16(n) of C.A. No. 146 [6-11].

3. **NO.** The fact that Morong Electric had no corporate existence when the franchise was granted on May 6, 1962, does not render the franchise invalid. A franchise may be applied for by promoters on behalf of a corporation not yet fully organized. The contract is perfected when the corporation, upon organization, accepts the franchise. Morong Electric’s incorporation on October 17, 1962, and its subsequent prosecution of the CPC application constituted acceptance. Furthermore, the efficacy of a municipal franchise arises only upon approval by the PSC. Since the PSC approved the franchise on March 13, 1963, when Morong Electric was already incorporated, the grant was valid [12-16].

Decisions affirmed.
