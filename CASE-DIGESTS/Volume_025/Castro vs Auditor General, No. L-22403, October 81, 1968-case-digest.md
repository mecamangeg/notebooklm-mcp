I. CAPTION
**LUIS BUENAVENTURA, ANTONIO and DANIEL CASTRO v. THE AUDITOR GENERAL OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-22403, October 31, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
The petitioners are the heirs of Daniel Tirona, the registered owner of certain lands (Lots 5 and 6) which were registered under the Torrens system in 1916 [1]. In 1917, the government constructed the Noveleta-Cavite road, occupying portions of these lots [1]. No annotation or deed of conveyance in favor of the government appeared on the titles, and the lands remained registered in the name of Tirona's heirs, who continued paying real estate taxes on the property [2].

In 1952, the heirs filed a claim for payment with the District Engineer. After failed negotiations, the claim was submitted to the respondent Auditor General in 1960 [2]. The Auditor General denied the claim on March 9, 1963, ruling that: (a) there is a presumption of regularity that the original owner had already been paid; and (b) if not, the claim had already prescribed [3]. The petitioners appealed this decision to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the presumption of regularity applies to validly assume the government already paid for the land.
2. W/N the petitioners' claim for compensation is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the presumption of regularity does not apply because the land is registered under the Torrens system. Under Section 50 of Act 496, the act of registration is the operative act to affect the land, and any conveyance (sale or donation) must be recorded and annotated on the title [3, 4]. The absence of any recorded deed or annotation rebuts the presumption that payment was made [4]. Since the failure to record a conveyance is "abnormal and irregular," the burden of proving payment shifted to the Government, which it failed to do [4].

2. **NO.** The Court held that registered lands are not subject to prescription [5]. Citing *Herrera v. Auditor General* and *Alfonso v. Pasay City*, the Court reiterated that where the government takes possession of private registered land without compensation, the duty to pay subsists regardless of the passage of time [6, 7]. Justice and equity demand that the government indemnify the landowners [8].

The decision of the Auditor General was **REVERSED**. The Government was directed to pay the petitioners the assessed value of the lots as of 1917, plus the amount of land taxes paid by them on said lots [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. The decision was unanimous, with Justice Zaldivar taking no part [9].
