I. CAPTION
LAURO ADAMOS, et al. v. J. M. TUASON & CO., INC. and GREGORIO ARANETA, INC., G.R. No. L-21957, October 14, 1968, 134 Phil. 533, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants (Adamos, et al.) filed a complaint for "Specific Performance and Damages" against defendants-appellees (J. M. Tuason & Co., Inc. and Gregorio Araneta, Inc.) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. Plaintiffs alleged that they purchased residential lots in Quezon City from the "Deudors" in 1949. They claimed entitlement to purchase these lots from the defendants based on a March 16, 1953 Compromise Agreement between the Deudors and J. M. Tuason & Co., which obligated the latter to execute new purchase contracts for legitimate purchasers.

Defendants filed motions to dismiss alleging improper venue and failure to state a cause of action. The CFI dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The trial court reasoned that the Compromise Agreement had already been rescinded, taking judicial notice of the Supreme Court's previous rulings in *Deudor vs. J. M. Tuason & Co.* and *J. M. Tuason & Co. vs. Sanvictores*, which declared the agreement rescinded due to the Deudors' failure to deliver possession of the lands. Plaintiffs appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal for failure to state a cause of action based on extraneous matters was proper.
2. W/N venue was properly laid in the CFI of Manila.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the sufficiency of a cause of action must be determined solely by the allegations in the complaint, which are hypothetically admitted as true for the purpose of the motion. The court cannot consider extraneous matters or facts not alleged in the complaint, such as the rescission of the Compromise Agreement mentioned in other cases. The defense of rescission requires evidence and must be raised in the answer and proven at trial, not in a motion to dismiss (*Garcon vs. Redemptorist Fathers*; *Republic Bank vs. Cuaderno*).

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the suit is a personal action, not a real action, because the plaintiffs sought to compel the execution of purchase contracts and claimed damages, rather than asserting ownership or seeking possession of the land. Since the plaintiffs recognized the defendants' title and were already in possession, the venue rules for real actions did not apply. Under the rules for personal actions, venue was properly laid in Manila at the election of the plaintiffs (Section 2, Rule 4, Rules of Court). The Court distinguished this from *Abao vs. J. M. Tuason & Co.*, where the action affected title to the property.

The order appealed from is set aside and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.
