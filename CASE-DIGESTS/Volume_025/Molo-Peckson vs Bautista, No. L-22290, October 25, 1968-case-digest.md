I. CAPTION
EMILIANA MOLO-PECKSON, ET AL. v. THE HON. PEDRO JL. BAUTISTA, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22290, October 25, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, foster children of the deceased spouses Mariano Molo and Juana Juan, received ten parcels of land in Pasay City via donation *inter vivos* with the condition that they sell said lots to private respondents (De Leons) for P1.00 each. Instead of complying, petitioners mortgaged the properties to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (now DBP) and Claro Cortez. In a previous final judgment (affirmed in G.R. No. L-17809), petitioners were ordered to free the lands from encumbrances, render an accounting, and execute the deed of sale in favor of respondents.

When the writ of execution was issued, petitioners failed to fully comply, arguing they had the option to pay the value of the land instead of selling it. The lower court rejected this interpretation and ordered them to clear the titles and execute the sale under pain of contempt. Petitioners filed the instant petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction to annul the lower court's order. During the pendency of the case, respondents filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that petitioners had voluntarily fulfilled the writ of execution by freeing the lots from all liens and encumbrances.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition should be dismissed for being moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court dismissed the case for being moot and academic. The respondents alleged that the petitioners had voluntarily complied with the writ of execution insofar as it directed them to free the subject lots from all liens and encumbrances. The petitioners failed to comment on the motion to dismiss despite the Court's directive. Since the petitioners performed the acts which they initially sought to avoid through this petition, the issue of whether they may be compelled to remove said encumbrances ceased to exist.

Case dismissed.
