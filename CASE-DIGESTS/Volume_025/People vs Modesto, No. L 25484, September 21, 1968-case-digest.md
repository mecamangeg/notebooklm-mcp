I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SERVILLANO MA. MODESTO, G.R. No. L-25484, September 21, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Melencio Modesto, 28, died between the evening of March 8 and the morning of March 9, 1963, in Hinunangan, Southern Leyte [1]. He had returned home after drinking and a series of disturbances involving his love interest [2, 3]. His father, Servillano Modesto, a sanitary inspector, initially attributed the death to "ongot" (cardiac failure) and the body was buried quickly on the afternoon of March 9 [4, 5]. Servillano allegedly kept the body covered and the room's floor appeared "whitish" as if scrubbed [4, 6]. However, on March 14, Servillano requested the local civil registrar to change the cause of death to murder, which was refused [5, 6]. An exhumation revealed two "nicely sutured" stab wounds on Melencio's chest [7].

The Court of First Instance of Southern Leyte convicted Servillano of parricide based solely on circumstantial evidence, citing his knowledge of suturing, the concealment of the wounds, and the quick burial [6, 8]. Servillano appealed the conviction, and the Solicitor General joined the plea for acquittal, arguing the evidence was insufficient [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the circumstantial evidence is sufficient to convict the accused of parricide beyond reasonable doubt [8, 9].

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the judgment and acquitted Servillano Modesto [10].

Under Section 5, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court, circumstantial evidence suffices to convict only if: (a) there is more than one circumstance; (b) the facts from which inferences are derived are proven; and (c) the combination of all circumstances produces a conviction beyond reasonable doubt [11]. The circumstances must constitute an unbroken chain leading to the conclusion that the accused is guilty "to the exclusion of all others" [12].

The Court found the prosecution failed to meet this standard for the following reasons:
1.  **Broken Chain of Events:** There was no direct evidence regarding how, when, or where the wounds were inflicted, nor were the weapons found [13].
2.  **Alternative Culprits:** The facts did not exclude other possible perpetrators, such as the teenagers Melencio encountered or his uncles [14].
3.  **Innocent Explanations:** Servillano's initial concealment of the cause of death was capable of innocent explanation, such as fear or a desire to hide the family tragedy, and did not necessarily imply guilt [15].
4.  **Unproven Inferences:** The trial court's finding that only Servillano knew how to suture was incorrect, as his daughter was a nurse [16]. The "whitish floor" was insufficient to prove the crime occurred in the room [17].
5.  **Unreliable Witness:** The principal witness, Graciano Cajotoc, executed conflicting affidavits and his testimony was contradicted by the police blotter [18, 19].
6.  **Lack of Motive:** While proof of motive is not indispensable, its absence creates a void in the evidence, especially in parricide cases [20]. The Court noted it is "contrary to the ordinary and natural course of things" for a father to kill his son without some "insuperable force," which was not shown in this case [20].

The judgment of the lower court was reversed and the defendant was acquitted [10].
