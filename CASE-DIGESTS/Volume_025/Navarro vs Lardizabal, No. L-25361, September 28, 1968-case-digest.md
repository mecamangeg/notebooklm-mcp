I. CAPTION
LEONARDO NAVARRO v. LUIS L. LARDIZABAL, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25361, September 28, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellant Leonardo Navarro occupied Stall No. 87 in the Baguio City Market for over six months, claiming he acquired ownership of the business conducted therein from the former lessee, Juanita Cachero [1]. Navarro paid regular fees and applied for the award of the stall under City Ordinance No. 314-A, but the City Market Committee postponed consideration of his application due to a protest by a third party, D.B. Baton [1, 2]. Consequently, his application remained unapproved [2].

On June 3, 1963, defendant-appellee City Mayor Luis Lardizabal issued an order directing the Chief of Police to eject Navarro from the stall. The Chief of Police executed the order on June 4, 1963, removing Navarro's stock [1]. Navarro filed an action for Prohibition and Injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Baguio City, claiming the defendants acted in excess of jurisdiction [1, 3]. The defendants argued that Juanita Cachero was the lawful lessee and Navarro was an illegal occupant without an approved application [4]. The CFI dismissed the complaint [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Navarro has a clear legal right to occupy the public market stall to entitle him to the writ of prohibition and injunction.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint. The Court ruled that the right to lease and occupy a stall in a public market is not a common right but a purely statutory privilege, governed by laws and ordinances (*Samson v. Fugoso*) [5, 6]. To claim such a right, an applicant must strictly comply with the relevant laws, such as Ordinance No. 314-A, which requires the stall to be declared vacant and the application approved [7].

Here, the stall was not vacant as Juanita Cachero remained the recognized lessee, and Navarro's application was never approved by the City Market Committee [8]. Occupancy of a public market stall cannot be the subject of a valid contract unless approved by the proper authority (*Mercado v. Aguilar*); without such approval, there is no valid legal right to occupy [9, 10]. Furthermore, the alleged transfer of the business from Cachero to Navarro did not validly transfer the right to occupy the stall, as Department of Finance Order No. 32 prohibits such transfers [11]. Since Navarro failed to show a clear legal right to the subject of the action, he is not entitled to the remedy of prohibition [12, 13]. The Mayor acted within his exclusive jurisdiction to maintain and control public markets [13].

**Appeal denied.**
