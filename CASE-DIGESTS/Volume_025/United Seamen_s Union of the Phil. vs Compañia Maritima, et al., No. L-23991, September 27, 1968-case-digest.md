I. CAPTION
UNITED SEAMEN'S UNION OF THE PHILIPPINES v. COMPAÑIA MARITIMA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23991, September 27, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On October 21, 1952, Petitioner United Seamen's Union of the Philippines (USUP) filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) under Commonwealth Act (C.A.) No. 103 against Respondent Compañia Maritima for union recognition and protection against dismissal. USUP later amended the petition to include demands for overtime pay, vacation/sick leave, hospitalization, and bonuses. While the case was pending, the Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act No. 875) took effect in 1953. Subsequently, a different union won the certification election and executed a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with the Respondent in 1954.

In 1964, the CIR rendered a decision dismissing USUP's claim for overtime pay for lack of substantial evidence, citing that the time records presented were fabricated. The CIR also refused to arbitrate the claims for leaves and bonuses, believing its power of compulsory arbitration under C.A. No. 103 had been abrogated by the policy of free bargaining under R.A. No. 875. USUP appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR committed reversible error in refusing to arbitrate the claims for leave and bonuses under C.A. No. 103 after the enactment of R.A. No. 875.
2. W/N the CIR erred in dismissing the claim for overtime pay based on the rejection of the petitioner's evidence.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Although the CIR was technically incorrect in believing it lost jurisdiction (as Section 27 of R.A. No. 875 empowers the court to process pending cases under C.A. No. 103), its refusal to arbitrate did not constitute reversible error. The Court reasoned that the claims were proper subjects of collective bargaining. Since a new exclusive bargaining agent had been certified and a CBA was already being negotiated/executed, any compulsory arbitration order would be prospective in nature and would necessarily yield to the terms of the CBA. Issuing such an order would be nugatory and merely cause confusion and unrest (*National Development Co. v. CIR*).

2. **NO.** The CIR did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the petitioner's time records. The evidence showed these records were not prepared in the regular course of business, were on blank forms not used by the company (issued by the union "fresh from the printing press"), and were prepared "at one sitting" after the case was filed. The Court applied the principle that where "forgery has been resorted to in order to strengthen the testimony, we must regard it as practically worthless" (*Gonzales v. Mauricio*; *Gabriel v. Naval*).

The petition is denied and the decision affirmed.
