I. CAPTION
J. M. TUASON & CO., INC. v. RAYMUNDO FAMILARA and CORNELIO S. RUPERTO, G.R. No. L-24934, September 28, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Cornelio S. Ruperto, counsel for defendant Raymundo Familara in a civil case, was found guilty of contempt of court by the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Judge Caluag) for hurling false and malicious charges against the court. The order imposing a P500.00 fine was issued on October 16, 1964, and served on Ruperto on October 26, 1964.

Ruperto filed a Motion for Reconsideration on November 12, 1964. After this was denied, he filed a Notice of Appeal on December 15, 1964. The lower court denied the appeal, ruling it was filed outside the reglementary period. Ruperto appealed this denial to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal from the order of contempt was filed within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The appeal was filed out of time.

The Supreme Court held that under Section 10, Rule 71 of the Rules of Court, an appeal from a judgment or order of a Court of First Instance in a contempt case "may be taken as in criminal cases." Consequently, the period provided for criminal appeals applies. Under Section 6, Rule 122 of the Rules of Court, an appeal must be taken within fifteen (15) days from promulgation or notice of the judgment or order.

Ruperto received the contempt order on October 26, 1964. The 15-day period expired on November 10, 1964. Since he filed his Motion for Reconsideration only on November 12, 1964, the filing was late. Due to his failure to file within the time allowed by law, the order finding him guilty of contempt had already become final and executory.

Appeal dismissed.
