I. CAPTION
THE SWEDISH EAST ASIA CO., LTD. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE AND/OR MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-26332, October 26, 1968, 25 SCRA 633, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Swedish East Asia Co., Ltd., a Swedish corporation not licensed to do business in the Philippines, owned the MS "Sudan" [1]. On December 3, 1957, the vessel arrived in Manila and discharged cargo. By mistake, sixteen bundles of mild steel destined for Hong Kong (consignee: Welcome Trading Co.) were discharged into the custody of respondent Manila Port Service (MPS), the arrastre operator [2]. This error occurred because forty similar bundles destined for Manila were discharged on the same day [2].

Petitioner’s agent in Manila discovered the mistake and arranged for reshipment, but only eight bundles were found; the other eight were lost while in MPS's custody [3, 4]. Petitioner paid the value of the missing goods to the Hong Kong consignee and filed a claim with MPS, which was rejected [4]. Petitioner then filed a complaint for recovery of sum of money in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [5]. The CFI ruled in favor of the petitioner [5]. However, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the decision, holding that the petitioner's action was time-barred under the Management Contract between MPS and the Bureau of Customs, which required claims to be filed within 15 days and suits within one year [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is bound by the prescriptive periods strictly set forth in the Management Contract.
2. W/N the petitioner, an unlicensed foreign corporation, has the capacity to sue in the Philippines.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petitioner is not bound by the Management Contract. While third parties who avail of arrastre services by taking delivery via a permit or pass are generally bound by such contracts, this doctrine does not apply when the goods are discharged by mistake [8]. The petitioner had no intention of availing itself of MPS's services or deriving benefit therefrom regarding the Hong Kong cargo [8]. Consequently, the petitioner's right to sue is not limited by the contract's preconditions [9]. The respondent's obligation arises from the actual receipt of goods to which it had no right, creating an obligation to return them to the one who delivered them by mistake [9, 10]. Therefore, the applicable prescriptive period is found in the Civil Code—either four years for injury to rights (Art. 1146) or five years for other actions (Art. 1149)—and the suit filed in 1961 for a 1957 incident was well within this period [11].

2. **YES.** Section 69 of the Corporation Law, which bars unlicensed foreign corporations from suing, is not applicable to single acts or "isolated transactions" [12]. There is no record that the petitioner was engaged in a continuing business in the Philippines [12]. The cargo was landed not as a result of a business transaction but due to a mistaken belief that it was part of the Manila shipment [12]. Thus, the petitioner has the capacity to sue.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED**, and respondents are ordered to pay the petitioner.
