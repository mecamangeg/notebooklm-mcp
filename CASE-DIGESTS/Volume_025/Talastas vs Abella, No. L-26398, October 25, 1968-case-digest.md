I. CAPTION
ELPIDIO TALASTAS v. CLEMENCO ABELLA, G.R. No. L-26398, October 25, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
In 1955, Elpidio Talastas and Clemenco Abella entered into an oral partnership to operate the "Sambat Recreation Center." Talastas contributed one-third of the capital, while Abella contributed two-thirds and managed the funds. After February 1956, Abella failed to render an accounting or deliver Talastas' share of the profits. Talastas filed a complaint for dissolution and accounting. Abella filed an answer simply denying the allegations in specific paragraphs of the complaint and claiming no partnership existed, but did not allege specific facts to support this denial. Talastas moved for summary judgment, arguing Abella’s answer was a general denial which amounted to an admission. Talastas attached six affidavits to prove the partnership's existence. Abella opposed the motion but did not submit counter-affidavits. The Court of First Instance rendered summary judgment in favor of Talastas. Abella appealed, arguing his denial was specific and a genuine issue of fact existed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Abella's answer constituted a general denial resulting in the admission of the complaint's material allegations.
2. W/N the summary judgment was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Section 1, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court, material averments in the complaint not specifically denied are deemed admitted. To be considered a "specific denial" under Section 10, Rule 8, the defendant must not only specify the material allegations not admitted but also set forth the substance of the matters relied upon to support the denial. Abella's answer merely listed the paragraph numbers he denied without providing any concrete facts or substance to controvert them. Consequently, he indulged in a general denial, effectively admitting the material allegations of the complaint, including the existence of the partnership.

2. **YES.** Summary judgment is justified where the pleadings, affidavits, and admissions show no genuine issue of fact (*Singleton v. Philippine Trust Co.*). Abella's general denial resulted in admissions that eliminated genuine issues. Furthermore, Talastas supported his motion with corroborating affidavits which Abella failed to rebut with counter-affidavits. Although an order for accounting is generally interlocutory and not appealable (*Fuentebella v. Carrascoso*), the Supreme Court resolved the issues to serve public interest and avoid further delay, as the case had been pending for ten years.

The decision is **AFFIRMED with modification**. The order to pay P1,600.00 is sustained. The awards for attorney's fees and other specific sums (P240.00 and P109.00) are set aside and directed to be credited in the final accounting, as their exact amounts depend on the result thereof.
