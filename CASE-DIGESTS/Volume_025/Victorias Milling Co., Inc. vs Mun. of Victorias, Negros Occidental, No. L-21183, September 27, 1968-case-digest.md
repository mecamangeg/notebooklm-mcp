I. CAPTION
VICTORIAS MILLING CO., INC. v. THE MUNICIPALITY OF VICTORIAS, PROVINCE OF NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, G.R. No. L-21183, September 27, 1968, 25 SCRA 192, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On September 22, 1956, the Municipal Council of Victorias enacted Ordinance No. 1, series of 1956, amending prior ordinances to increase municipal license taxes on the operation of sugar centrals and sugar refineries [1]. The ordinance imposed a graduated schedule of taxes based on the annual output capacity of the mills; for capacities exceeding 1,500,001 piculs/bags, the annual tax was fixed at P40,000.00 [2-4]. Victorias Milling Co., Inc., the sole operator of a sugar central and refinery in the municipality, filed suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental to declare the ordinance void and seek a refund of taxes paid under protest [5]. The company argued that the ordinance was discriminatory, constituted double taxation, exceeded the cost of regulation, and that the field of taxation was preempted by the National Government [6]. The CFI declared the ordinance invalid, reasoning that as a "license tax," it should be limited to regulatory costs, but denied a full refund on equitable grounds [7, 8]. Both parties appealed directly to the Supreme Court [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Ordinance No. 1, series of 1956, is a valid revenue measure derived from the municipality's taxing power.
2. W/N the National Government has preempted the municipality from taxing sugar centrals and refineries.
3. W/N the ordinance constitutes prohibited double taxation.
4. W/N the ordinance is discriminatory.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The ordinance is a valid revenue measure. Under Section 1 of Commonwealth Act (C.A.) No. 472, municipalities are authorized to impose three kinds of licenses: for regulation of useful occupations, for regulation of non-useful occupations, and for revenue [10, 11]. While termed a "license tax," the imposition here is for revenue purposes, evidenced by the high rates (P40,000) and the lack of regulatory or inspection provisions [12]. The designation given by municipal authorities is not controlling; the purpose to raise revenue was explicit in the accompanying Resolution No. 60 [13-16]. Thus, the limit that fees must correspond to the cost of regulation does not apply [17].

2. **NO.** The doctrine of preemption does not apply. While Section 1 of C.A. No. 472 prohibits municipalities from imposing "percentage taxes," the tax in question is based on a graduated schedule of "annual output capacity," which is not a percentage tax [18]. Furthermore, Section 4(1) of C.A. No. 472 expressly allows municipal councils to tax businesses on which "fixed internal revenue privilege taxes" are regularly imposed by the National Government [19, 20].

3. **NO.** There is no double taxation. Double taxation requires taxing the same person twice by the same jurisdiction for the same thing [21]. Here, the two taxes cover distinct objects: one is on the business of operating a sugar central, and the other is on the business of operating a sugar refinery [22]. Moreover, the tax is on the *privilege* of operating the business (occupation tax) based on capacity, not a tax on the *sugar products* themselves [22, 23].

4. **NO.** The ordinance is not discriminatory. Although Victorias Milling is currently the only operator in the municipality, the ordinance applies generally to *any* person or entity that may operate a sugar central or refinery within the jurisdiction [1, 24].

The judgment of the lower court is REVERSED, and Ordinance No. 1, series of 1956, is declared valid and subsisting [25].
