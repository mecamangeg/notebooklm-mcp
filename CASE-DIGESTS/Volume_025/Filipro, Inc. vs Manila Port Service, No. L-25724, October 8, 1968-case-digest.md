I. CAPTION
**FILIPRO, INC. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY**, G.R. No. L-25724, October 8, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Filipro, Inc. (consignee) filed an action to recover the value of seven shipments of condensed milk and infant food discharged into the custody of Manila Port Service and Manila Railroad Company (arrastre operators) between January 15 and March 13, 1962 [1, 2]. Filipro filed provisional claims for the goods within 15 days from the discharge of the last package of each shipment, followed by formal claims at later dates [2, 3]. The defendants did not expressly reject or deny these claims [4]. On October 7, 1963, Filipro filed a complaint for recovery [5].

The Municipal Court of Manila rendered an adverse decision against Filipro, but on appeal, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila ruled in Filipro's favor [6]. The defendants appealed directly to the Supreme Court, arguing that: (1) the provisional claims were invalid because they did not state the value of the goods as allegedly required by the management contract; and (2) the action was barred by prescription because it was filed more than one year after the discharge of the goods [3, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the provisional claims filed without specifying the value of the goods are valid.
2. W/N the action was filed within the prescriptive period under the management contract.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A provisional claim is sufficient compliance with the management contract even if the value of the goods is not stated therein [7]. The Supreme Court held that a claim substantially fulfills the requirements if it describes the goods sufficiently to permit their identification by the operator and the determination of relevant facts (such as the carrying vessel and date of arrival) while documents are still available (*Domestic Insurance Co. v. Manila Railroad Co.*; *State Bonding & Insurance Co. v. Manila Port Service*) [7, 8]. The lack of specified value in the provisional claim is not a valid defense against the consignee's recovery [8].

2. **YES.** Paragraph 15 of the management contract provides two periods for filing an action: (a) one year from the date of discharge of the goods, or (b) one year from the date of rejection or denial of the claim [4, 9]. The Court cited established jurisprudence holding that in case of the arrastre operator's inaction, a claim is deemed rejected or denied upon the expiration of one year from the date of discharge (*Villaruel v. Manila Port Service*; *Ang Ching Gi v. Delgado Brothers*) [10]. The period to file suit begins to run from that deemed rejection [10]. Here, the claims were deemed rejected between January 15 and March 13, 1963 (one year after discharge), giving Filipro until January-March 1964 to sue. The complaint filed on October 7, 1963, was therefore timely [11].

**Decision affirmed.**
