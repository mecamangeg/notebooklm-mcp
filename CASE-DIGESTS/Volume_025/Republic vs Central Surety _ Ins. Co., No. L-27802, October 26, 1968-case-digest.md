I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CENTRAL SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-27802, October 26, 1968, 25 SCRA 641, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Central Surety & Insurance Company (Surety) executed a P5,000 bond for the temporary release of Po Kee Kam, a respondent in deportation proceedings. The bond was conditioned on Po Kee Kam's availability to the Deportation Board. On December 14, 1962, Po Kee Kam failed to appear at a scheduled hearing despite due notice to the Surety, resulting in the forfeiture of the bond.

On June 20, 1963, the Republic filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to recover the bond amount plus attorney's fees. On July 30, 1963, the Surety filed a third-party complaint against Po Kee Kam and Tony Go based on an indemnity agreement they executed.

The CFI rendered judgment ordering the Surety to pay the Republic P5,000 but dismissed the third-party complaint for lack of jurisdiction. The trial court reasoned that the third-party claim (P6,000) was below the new jurisdictional amount (P10,000) for CFIs under Republic Act No. 3828, which took effect on June 22, 1963. The Surety appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Surety is liable on the confiscated bond.
2. W/N the trial court retained jurisdiction over the main case despite the effectivity of R.A. 3828.
3. W/N the trial court has jurisdiction over the third-party complaint.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Surety is liable. The evidence showed that the Surety received notice to produce Po Kee Kam and even moved for postponement, which was denied. The principal's failure to appear justified the forfeiture of the bond. Findings of fact by the trial court are entitled to respect unless arbitrarily arrived at.

2. **YES.** Jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by the law in force at the time of the commencement of the action. The complaint was filed on June 20, 1963, two days before R.A. 3828 took effect. The rule is firmly entrenched that jurisdiction once acquired continues until the case is finally terminated (*Pamintuan v. Tigalo*).

3. **YES.** A third-party complaint is an ancillary suit dependent on the court's jurisdiction over the main action. Since the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the main complaint, it necessarily has jurisdiction over incidental matters arising therefrom, such as the third-party complaint, to avoid "split jurisdiction" and multiplicity of suits (*Philippine Products Co. v. Court of Appeals*). Unlike a counterclaim, a third-party complaint does not need independent jurisdiction if the court has jurisdiction over the main action (*Talisay-Silay Milling Co. v. CIR*).

The Supreme Court further resolved the third-party complaint on the merits to obviate further litigation, noting that the third-party defendants failed to specifically deny the indemnity agreement as required by Rule 8, Section 10 of the Revised Rules of Court.

The order dismissing the third-party complaint is **SET ASIDE**, and the decision is **MODIFIED**; third-party defendants are ordered to reimburse the Surety whatever amount it pays the Republic.
