I. CAPTION
LAGUNA COLLEGE, petitioner, vs. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, LAGUNA COLLEGE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION (LACTA)-CCLU, and THE DIRECTOR, BUREAU OF LABOR RELATIONS, respondents., G.R. No. L-28927, September 25, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On October 20, 1967, petitioner Laguna College filed a petition for certification election with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to determine the bargaining representative for its teachers. Respondent union LACTA intervened. Following a strike on January 2, 1968, the parties executed a return-to-work agreement on January 4, 1968, wherein they waived the right to appeal any decision of the CIR trial court in the pending case, except on questions of law.

On March 11, 1968, the trial judge issued an order declaring the appropriate bargaining unit to be the "employer unit" comprising all teachers. The order also classified eight specific employees (Almanzor, Lainez, Neri, Belen, Briones, Cortez Sr., Pisigan, and Torres) as rank-and-file employees eligible to vote, rejecting petitioner's claim that they were supervisors. Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the eight employees were supervisors and that there should be two separate bargaining units (one for the college and one for the high school). The CIR *en banc* denied the motion. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the eight specific employees are supervisors who should be ineligible to vote.
2. W/N the bargaining unit should be split into two separate units for college and high school teachers.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the eight employees are not supervisors. The trial judge found that these employees, some designated as "area supervisors," did not possess the authority to hire, fire, layoff, suspend, transfer, discipline, or adjust grievances of other teachers, which are the attributes of a supervisor under Section 2(k) of Republic Act No. 875. Their functions were merely recommendatory and subject to review. Furthermore, the Court ruled that the classification of these employees is a question of fact. Since the parties waived their right to appeal except on questions of law in their January 4, 1968 return-to-work agreement, the petitioner is barred from raising this factual issue.

2. **NO.** The Court sustained the CIR's discretion in establishing a single "employer unit." The Court found that the factors favoring a single unit outweighed those for separation. Both departments are under one Board of Trustees, housed in the same building, and served by the same administrative officers. Additionally, some teachers teach in both departments, proving a community of interest. The Court noted that splitting the 130 teachers into two units would dissipate their bargaining strength and could lead to industrial unrest by having two unions vying against each other.

The petition is dismissed.
