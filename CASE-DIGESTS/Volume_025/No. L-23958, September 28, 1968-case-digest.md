I. CAPTION
EASTERN PAPER MILLS EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION-NATU v. EASTERN PAPER MILLS, INC. and HON. GUILLERMO E. TORRES, G.R. No. L-23958, September 28, 1968, 25 SCRA 234, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On October 9, 1964, petitioner Union declared a strike against respondent Company, alleging unfair labor practices (ULP) due to bad faith in collective bargaining. On October 12, the Company filed a civil suit for damages (Civil Case No. 8416) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, claiming the strike prevented product deliveries. On October 13, respondent Judge Torres issued an *ex-parte* restraining order against the strikers. The Union moved to dismiss the case and dissolve the order, arguing the dispute involved ULP and thus fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). The CFI denied the motion. The Union filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition, asserting the CFI lacked jurisdiction and violated the law by issuing the order *ex-parte*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CFI has jurisdiction over the civil complaint for damages arising from the labor dispute.
2. W/N the *ex-parte* restraining order issued by the CFI was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** However, it must suspend proceedings. Jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint. To divest the CFI of jurisdiction, there must be a clear showing—not mere allegation—that the acts complained of are connected to an unfair labor practice case. At the time the Union moved to dismiss, it failed to present evidence connecting the civil case to a ULP charge in the CIR. Thus, the CFI did not abuse its discretion in assuming jurisdiction. However, since the claim for damages depends on the legality of the strike (a ULP issue), the CFI should inhibit itself from further proceedings until the CIR decides the labor dispute [1-3].

2. **NO.** The restraining order is void. Section 9(d) of Republic Act No. 875 provides a specific procedure for issuing injunctions in labor disputes, which requires a hearing and testimony of witnesses. The CFI patently violated this provision by issuing the restraining order *ex-parte* [4].

The petition is **GRANTED** only with respect to the annulment of the restraining order.
