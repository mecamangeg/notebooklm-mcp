I. CAPTION
LIM KIAH v. THE KAYNEE COMPANY and THE DIRECTOR OF PATENTS, G.R. No. L-24802, October 14, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On April 5, 1957, petitioner Lim Kiah filed an application with the Philippines Patent Office to register the trademark "KAYNEE" for various clothing items, claiming first use on January 7, 1957. Respondent Kaynee Company, a South Carolina corporation, opposed the application, claiming ownership via a 1913 U.S. registration and use in the Philippines since 1951.

The Director of Patents dismissed Kaynee Company's opposition for failing to prove it authorized Aguinaldo's Department Store to use the mark. However, the Director rejected Lim Kiah's application *ex parte*. The Director found that Aguinaldo's had been advertising and selling "KAYNEE" products in the Philippines since 1953, meaning the mark was previously used by "another." Lim Kiah appealed, arguing he established ownership and that the Director misinterpreted the law regarding prior use.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the factual findings of the Director of Patents are binding on the Supreme Court.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to register the trademark "KAYNEE" despite its prior use by Aguinaldo's Department Store.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that findings of fact by the Director of Patents are conclusive on the Court provided they are supported by substantial evidence [1]. Absent a showing of grave abuse of discretion, the Court is precluded from inquiring into such factual findings [1].

2. **NO.** Under Rule 34 of the Revised Rules of Practice in Trademark Cases, only the owner of a trademark may apply for its registration [2]. The evidence showed that Aguinaldo's Department Store had used and advertised "KAYNEE" in the Philippines since 1953 [2]. Section 4(d) of Republic Act No. 166 prohibits the registration of a mark that resembles a mark or tradename "previously used in the Philippines by another and not abandoned" [2]. The Court ruled that the statute is unequivocal; the word "another" clearly refers to Aguinaldo's [2, 3]. Citing *Lizarraga Hermanos v. Yap Tico*, the Court emphasized that when the law is clear, the first duty is to apply it without need for construction or interpretation [4]. Petitioner cannot appropriate a mark already well-known and patronized locally [5].

The decision of the Director of Patents is affirmed [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Castro, J., concurs in the result [6].
