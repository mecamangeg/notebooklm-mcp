I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SOCORRO MONGAYA and FELIPE MONGAYA, G.R. No. L-23708, October 31, 1968, Capistrano, J.

II. FACTS
On September 3, 1963, at around 5:00 PM in Allen, Samar, brothers Socorro (18 years old) and Felipe Mongaya (17 years old) were looking for Santos Garcia. They encountered Juan Briones and Socorro stated, "If only I will see him now... we will kill him." About an hour later, Briones saw Socorro stabbing Santos with a sharp-pointed weapon while Felipe held Santos fast by the left arm. Santos died from six stab wounds. The Court of First Instance of Samar convicted the brothers of murder, sentencing Socorro to *reclusion perpetua* and Felipe to an indeterminate sentence. They appealed, claiming alibi and questioning the finding of conspiracy and qualifying circumstances.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N there was conspiracy between the appellants.
2. W/N evident premeditation attended the commission of the crime.
3. W/N treachery was present in the killing.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Conspiracy exists when there is a previous concert of criminal design or participation in the same criminal intent. The evidence showed that the brothers searched for the victim together, expressed their intent to kill him to a witness, and coordinated their attack—Socorro stabbed the victim while Felipe held him [1, 2]. These concerted acts demonstrated their individual, direct participation in the execution of the crime they agreed to commit [2].

2. **YES.** The appellants had sufficient time for full meditation and reflection on their criminal design. They expressed their intent to kill at 5:00 PM and committed the crime at 6:00 PM; this interval constitutes evident premeditation [3].

3. **YES.** Treachery was present because although the attack was frontal, the victim was unarmed and held fast by Felipe, rendering him unable to defend himself. The killing was committed in a manner that ensured execution without risk to the killers [3].

Because treachery qualified the killing to Murder, evident premeditation was treated as a generic aggravating circumstance. Socorro, aged 18, was sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* due to the lack of votes for the death penalty [4]. Felipe, aged 17, was granted a privileged mitigating circumstance under Article 68(2) of the Revised Penal Code, reducing his penalty by one degree [4].

**Judgment AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.** Socorro Mongaya's sentence of *reclusion perpetua* is affirmed. Felipe Mongaya is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 10 years of *prision mayor* to 15 years of *reclusion temporal*. Civil indemnity is increased to P12,000 [5, 6].
