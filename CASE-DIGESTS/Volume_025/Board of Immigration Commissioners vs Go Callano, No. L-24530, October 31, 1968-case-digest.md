I. CAPTION
BOARD OF IMMIGRATION COMMISSIONERS and COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION vs. BEATO GO CALLANO, MANUEL GO CALLANO, GONZALO GO CALLANO and JULIO GO CALLANO and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-24530, October 31, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Go Callano brothers are illegitimate children of a Filipino mother and a Chinese father, born in the Philippines between 1936 and 1945. In 1946, they went to China with their parents. Their father died there, and their mother returned to the Philippines in 1948, leaving them behind. In 1961, respondents applied for entry with the Philippine Consulate in Hong Kong. Upon authorization via a DFA cablegram, the Consul documented them as Filipino citizens. They arrived in Manila and were admitted as citizens by the Board of Special Inquiry (BSI) on January 4, 1962.

Subsequently, the DFA claimed the cable authorization was a forgery. On August 21, 1962, without notice or hearing, the Board of Immigration Commissioners (BIC) reversed the BSI decision and ordered respondents' exclusion as aliens. Respondents filed an injunction suit. The CFI found they were Filipino citizens by birth but ruled they lost citizenship due to their 15-year stay in China and recognition by their alien father. The Court of Appeals reversed the CFI, holding that respondents did not lose their citizenship.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondents lost their Philippine citizenship due to their prolonged stay in China and recognition by their alien father.
2. W/N the Board of Immigration Commissioners observed due process in reversing the BSI decision and ordering deportation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Commonwealth Act No. 63, as amended, the grounds for losing Philippine citizenship are exclusive. Recognition of an illegitimate child by an alien father is not among these grounds [1], [2]. Furthermore, loss of citizenship via renunciation must be express; it cannot be implied from a prolonged stay in a foreign country. Respondents were minors when brought to China and lacked the legal capacity to renounce citizenship. Upon reaching majority, respondent Beato applied for registration and entry, manifesting his intent to return [2].

2. **NO.** The proceedings before the BIC were conducted summarily. The order reversing the BSI decision and the warrant of exclusion were issued without giving the respondents prior notice or an opportunity to be heard. This constitutes a violation of the constitutional guarantee of due process [3], [4]. Even if the cable authorization were forged, it would not automatically nullify the findings of the Consulate and the BSI regarding the respondents' status as citizens based on their birth and blood relationship [4].

The petition is DENIED and the decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.
