**I. CAPTION**
TANGLAW NG PAGGAWA, petitioner, vs. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and RED V COCONUT PRODUCTS, LTD., respondents., G.R. No. L-24498, September 21, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
In October 1961, petitioner Tanglaw Ng Paggawa (Union) and respondent Red V Coconut Products, Ltd. (Company) entered into a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). A dispute arose regarding the interpretation of the "Vacation Plan" provision for mill employees working less than 90% of milling days. The Union demanded payment based on its interpretation, but the Company refused, applying its own reading of the contract [1, 2].

The Union filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), alleging that the Company's bad faith refusal to comply with the CBA caused a wave of resignations, reducing union membership from 800 to 700 [3]. The hearing judge ruled in favor of the Union. However, the CIR *en banc* reversed the decision and dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, finding no evidence that the non-enforcement of the CBA caused the resignations or that the Company acted in bad faith [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the respondent Company committed an unfair labor practice.
2. W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over the case.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** Unfair labor practice is in the nature of a criminal offense and must be clearly proved by direct or circumstantial evidence; it cannot be presumed merely from the fact of members' resignations [4]. The Court found that the Company applied its interpretation of the vacation leave provision to all employees regardless of union affiliation, negating discrimination [4]. Furthermore, the Company enforced the benefit retroactively to January 1, 1961, despite the contract becoming effective only in August, which evidenced good faith [4]. The Union failed to prove the Company designed its conduct to produce the resignations [4].

2. **NO.** Since there was no unfair labor practice, the issue is reduced to a simple divergence of opinion regarding the application of the CBA [5]. The interpretation and enforcement of contractual stipulations devolve upon the regular courts, not the Court of Industrial Relations (*Phil. Sugar Institute v. C.I.R.*; *Elizalde Paint & Oil Factory, Inc. v. Bautista*) [5].

The resolution under review is affirmed [6].
