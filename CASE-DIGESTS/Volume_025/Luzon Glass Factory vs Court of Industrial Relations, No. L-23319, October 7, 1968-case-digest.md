I. CAPTION
LUZON GLASS FACTORY v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and FAR EASTERN-LUZON GLASS WORKERS UNION, G.R. No. L-23319, October 7, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On February 9, 1960, employees of petitioner Luzon Glass Factory organized the respondent Union. Upon being officially informed of the Union's formation on February 13, 1960, the Factory's manager threatened the officers and members with dismissal. Subsequently, union members were either laid off or transferred to a sister company (FEMCO) and eventually laid off. The Union filed charges of unfair labor practice (ULP) against the Factory. The trial judge dismissed the complaint for lack of evidence, but the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) *en banc* reversed the decision, finding the Factory guilty of ULP and ordering the reinstatement of the employees with backpay. The Factory appealed to the Supreme Court via certiorari. However, pending the resolution of the appeal, the parties filed a "joint motion to dismiss" on September 18, 1968, stating that they had reached an amicable settlement.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed due to the amicable settlement of the parties.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the amicable settlement reached by the parties rendered the case moot and academic. The "joint motion to dismiss," signed by the parties and the complaining employees, explicitly stated that they had settled the subject matter of the controversy to their "full and complete satisfaction" and mutually waived all claims and causes of action against each other [1, 2]. Where parties have amicably settled the controversy, the settlement renders the case moot [3].

Accordingly, the appeal by certiorari is dismissed.
