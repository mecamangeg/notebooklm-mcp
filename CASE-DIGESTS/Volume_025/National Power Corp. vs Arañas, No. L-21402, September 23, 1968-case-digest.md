I. CAPTION
NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION v. JOSE ARAÑAS, MELECIO DOMINGO, and COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-21402, September 23, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
From May 30, 1953, to June 30, 1955, petitioner National Power Corporation (NPC) purchased lumber from Heald Lumber Company for P702,816.38 [1, 2]. The 5% sales tax imposed by Section 186 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) was not paid by the seller because NPC represented that it was tax-exempt under its charter (Republic Act No. 358) and agreed to assume liability should the tax be found due [3]. NPC secured an opinion from the Secretary of Justice on May 14, 1954, supporting this exemption, but the Cabinet revoked this opinion on February 25, 1955 [3]. NPC subsequently paid the principal tax of P35,140.82 on October 14, 1955, but refused to pay the 25% surcharge for late payment, claiming good faith reliance on the Justice Secretary's opinion [3, 4]. The Court of Tax Appeals affirmed the Collector of Internal Revenue's decision imposing the surcharge, prompting this appeal [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N NPC is liable for the 25% surcharge for non-payment of sales tax within the statutory period.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment, holding that there was no sufficient evidence of good faith on the part of the petitioner to justify exemption from the surcharge [6]. The Court noted that NPC claimed exemption as early as May 1953, a year before the Secretary of Justice issued the supporting opinion in May 1954, indicating NPC acted on its own interpretation while admitting the possibility of error by agreeing to assume the seller's liability [4]. Furthermore, NPC delayed full payment until October 1955, nearly eight months after the Cabinet revoked the exemption opinion [4].

On the substantive legal principle, the Court ruled that the tax exemption under Republic Act No. 358 applies only to taxes "directly payable" by NPC [7]. The sales tax under Section 186 of the NIRC is a tax on the seller (Heald Lumber Co.), not the buyer; thus, exempting NPC would improperly result in exempting the seller, which is not justified by the Revenue Code [7].

Judgment affirmed [8].
