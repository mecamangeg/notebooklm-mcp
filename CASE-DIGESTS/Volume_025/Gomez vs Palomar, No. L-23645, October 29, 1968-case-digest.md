I. CAPTION
BENJAMIN P. GOMEZ v. ENRICO PALOMAR, et al., G.R. No. L-23645, October 29, 1968, Castro, J. [1], [2], [3]

II. FACTS
On September 15, 1963, petitioner Benjamin P. Gomez mailed a letter in San Fernando, Pampanga, which was returned to him because it did not bear the special anti-TB stamp required by Republic Act 1635, as amended by Republic Act 2631 [4], [5]. The statute required the semi-postal stamp on all mail matter from August 19 to September 30 annually to raise funds for the Philippine Tuberculosis Society [4]. Gomez filed a suit for declaratory relief in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga challenging the constitutionality of the statute and the implementing Administrative Orders issued by the Postmaster General [5]. He argued that the law violated the equal protection clause, the rule of uniformity in taxation, and constituted an undue delegation of legislative power [6], [7], [8]. The lower court declared the statute and orders unconstitutional, prompting the respondents to appeal [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action for declaratory relief was proper despite the breach of the statute.
2. W/N the Anti-TB Stamp Law violates the equal protection clause.
3. W/N the tax violates the rule of uniformity and equality of taxation.
4. W/N the tax is for a public purpose.
5. W/N the issuance of administrative orders constituted undue delegation of legislative power.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Although Rule 64, Section 1 requires an action for declaratory relief to be brought before a breach of the statute, and the petitioner had already violated the law by mailing a letter without the stamp, the remedy is accepted because the petitioner sought a ruling regarding other mails he might send in the future [9], [10], [11].

2. **NO.** The legislature has the inherent power to select subjects of taxation and grant exemptions [12]. The classification of mail users is based on valid distinctions: ability to pay, the enjoyment of a privilege, and administrative convenience [13]. The exemption of newspapers and government offices does not constitute invidious discrimination offensive to the Constitution [14], [15].

3. **NO.** The imposition of a flat rate rather than a graduated tax does not infringe the rule of uniformity [16]. Considerations of administrative convenience and cost afford an adequate ground for classification, and the tax is in the nature of an excise tax laid upon the privilege of using the mails [12], [16].

4. **YES.** The eradication of a dreaded disease is a public purpose [7]. The benefit to the taxpayer need not be a direct return; it is sufficient that the taxpayer derives benefit from the enjoyment of the privileges of living in an organized society established and safeguarded by the devotion of taxes to public purposes [7]. The Philippine Tuberculosis Society is merely the agency through which the State acts in carrying out a public function [17].

5. **NO.** While the law did not expressly authorize the collection of cash in lieu of stamps for certain mail categories, such authority is implied to prevent a failure of the undertaking [18]. The authority given to the Postmaster General to raise funds must be liberally construed consistent with the principle that where the end is required, the appropriate means are given [18].

**Disposition:** ACCORDINGLY, the judgment a *quo* is reversed, and the complaint is dismissed, without pronouncement as to costs [19].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Fernando, J.** (Concurring): He concurred with the result but opined that the validity of the legislation could also be sustained based on **police power**—specifically the regulatory power connected with the performance of the public postal service—rather than solely on the power of taxation [19], [20].
