**I. CAPTION**
LO BENG HA ONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-24503, September 28, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J. [1], [2]

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Lo Beng Ha Ong, a Chinese national born in the Philippines, married Nelson Ong, a natural-born Filipino citizen, on June 27, 1964 [3]. Following her marriage, she filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Camarines Norte to be declared a Filipino citizen and to cancel her Alien Certificate of Registration [4]. She argued that her marriage automatically conferred citizenship upon her and cited Civil Code provisions regarding a wife's obligation to live with her husband to support her plea for a relaxation of naturalization requirements [5]. The trial court ruled in her favor, declaring her a Filipino citizen by reason of her marriage [2]. The Republic appealed, arguing that marriage does not automatically confer citizenship [2], [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the marriage of an alien woman to a Filipino citizen automatically confers Philippine citizenship upon her. [6]

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision [7]. Under the first paragraph of Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization Law, an alien woman married to a Filipino citizen is "deemed a citizen of the Philippines" only if she proves that she "might herself be lawfully naturalized" [6]. This means she must establish that she possesses all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications required by the Naturalization Law [6]. The Court emphasized that citizenship is a political privilege the State may grant or withhold, distinct from the Civil Code provisions governing the private relations between husband and wife [8], [7].

Here, the petitioner failed to sustain her burden. She did not provide competent witnesses to prove her good moral character and failed to show she was free from disqualifications such as opposing organized government or polygamy [9], [10]. Furthermore, her attendance at a predominantly Chinese school negated her claim of sincerely embracing Filipino customs and traditions [10].

The judgment was reversed and the petition was dismissed [7].
