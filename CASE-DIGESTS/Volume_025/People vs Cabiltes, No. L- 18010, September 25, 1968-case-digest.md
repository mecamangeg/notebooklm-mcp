I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. TEOFILO CABILTES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18010, September 25, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On May 31, 1960, during a barrio fiesta in Kananga, Leyte, Teofilo Cabiltes learned that his father had been assaulted by Esteban Mesias [1]. Seeking revenge, Teofilo conspired with appellant Gonzalo Cabiltes and others to kill Mesias [1]. Accompanied by 15-year-old eyewitness Faustino Alapan, the group overtook Mesias on the road [1, 2]. Teofilo stabbed Mesias in the back with a hunting knife, followed by Gonzalo who stabbed him in the breast with a small bolo [2]. They dumped the body in a canal [2]. The Court of First Instance of Leyte convicted Teofilo and Gonzalo of murder, sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua* [3, 4]. Teofilo withdrew his appeal, leaving Gonzalo as the sole appellant [5]. Gonzalo argued that Alapan’s testimony was riddled with inconsistencies regarding his whereabouts prior to the crime and that their extrajudicial confessions were obtained through maltreatment [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N appellant Gonzalo Cabiltes is guilty of murder beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The alleged contradictions in Alapan’s testimony regarding time and place were trivial and did not negate his credibility, especially as he had no motive to perjure himself [7, 8]. Gonzalo’s denial was overturned by proof of conspiracy, as he joined the planning and was present during the stabbing [9]. Physical evidence corroborated the eyewitness account, as the victim sustained wounds from two different weapons—a hunting knife and a small bolo [10, 11]. Additionally, the extrajudicial confession of co-accused Teofilo implicating Gonzalo was admitted. While generally admissible only against the declarant, jurisprudence allows such confessions as corroborative evidence of facts establishing the guilt of a co-defendant (*People v. Simbajon*) and against all conspirators once conspiracy is proven (*People v. Belen*) [12]. The claim of coercion was rejected for lack of medical evidence or witnesses [6]. The judgment *a quo* is affirmed *in toto* [13].
