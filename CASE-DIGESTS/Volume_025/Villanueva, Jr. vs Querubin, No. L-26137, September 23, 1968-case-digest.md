I. CAPTION
EUGENIO V. VILLANUEVA, JR. v. HON. JOSE R. QUERUBIN, in his capacity as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, ELVIRA GUANZON and MIGUEL MATTI, G.R. No. L-26137, September 23, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Atty. Eugenio V. Villanueva, Jr. was engaged by respondents Elvira Guanzon and Miguel Matti to file Civil Case No. 7725 against provincial officials of Negros Occidental [1]. During the trial, Villanueva presented various public documents which were marked as exhibits [2, 3]. While the case was pending and before his professional fees were paid, Guanzon and Matti terminated his services [4]. Respondent Judge Querubin ordered Villanueva to surrender the documents and exhibits to the Clerk of Court [5, 6]. Villanueva refused, asserting a retaining lien over the documents until his fees were paid, leading the Judge to declare him in contempt and issue a warrant for his arrest [7, 8]. Villanueva filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus to annul the orders and compel recognition of his lien [5, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an attorney’s retaining lien extends to public documents and exhibits introduced in court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, ruling that an attorney's retaining lien does not apply to public documents introduced in court as exhibits [10, 11]. These documents are subject to the court's custody [11, 12]. To allow a lawyer to retain such documents would "curtail unduly the inherent power of a judicial tribunal in the conduct of the proceedings before it" and injure the fair and efficient administration of justice [10, 12].

The Court distinguished the case from *Rustia v. Abeto* (72 Phil. 133), clarifying that while a retaining lien generally attaches to documents turned over by a client, it does not cover public records brought to court via subpoena and marked as exhibits [3, 13]. Consequently, the respondent Judge did not abuse his discretion in ordering the surrender of the documents and punishing the petitioner's defiance [14].

The petition was dismissed with costs against the petitioner.
