I. CAPTION
ANICIA CADIZ v. THE SECRETARY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE and THE CHIEF, GENERAL AFFAIRS OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, JOHN DOE, G.R. No. L-25150, September 30, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
A 1962 Chrysler car was originally imported tax-free by T/Sgt. John A. Cheffler of the US Air Force under the PI-US Military Bases Agreement [1]. On June 22, 1964, Cheffler sold the car to a non-tax-exempt individual, and ownership subsequently passed to others without payment of duties [1]. On April 22, 1965, the Collector of Customs issued a Warrant of Seizure and Detention for violation of the Tariff and Customs Code and the National Internal Revenue Code, leading to the car's seizure from one Carlos Robes [2].

On May 11, 1965, petitioner Anicia Cadiz filed an action for replevin in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal claiming ownership of the car [2]. The CFI issued a writ of replevin [2]. However, the Collector of Customs intervened and moved to dismiss the case on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction and failure to exhaust administrative remedies [2]. The CFI granted the motion, dismissed the complaint, and lifted the writ [2]. Cadiz appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appeal should be dismissed for procedural defects.
2. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to review the validity of a warrant of seizure issued by the Collector of Customs.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The appeal should not be entertained because the record on appeal failed to include the order appealed from and lacked data showing that the appeal was perfected on time, in violation of Section 6, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court [3].

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the determination of the validity of a warrant of seizure issued by the Collector of Customs for alleged violations of the Revised Tariff and Customs Code and the National Internal Revenue Code falls within the **exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals** under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125 [4], [5]. Consequently, the Court of First Instance had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition or issue the writ of replevin [6]. Furthermore, the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies, which included securing the release of the seized article by filing a bond or filing a protest with the Customs Collector [7].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Reyes, J.B.L., Makalintal, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, Fernando, and Capistrano, JJ., concurred [8]. Dizon and Zaldivar, JJ., did not take part [8].
