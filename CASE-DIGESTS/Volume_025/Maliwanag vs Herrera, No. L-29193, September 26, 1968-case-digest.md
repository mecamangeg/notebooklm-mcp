**I. CAPTION**
CIPRIANO P. MALIWANAG v. HON. AMEURFINA MELENCIO HERRERA and CESAR V. BOLAÑOS, G.R. No. L-29193, September 26, 1968, Angeles, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Maliwanag and Respondent Bolaños were candidates for Mayor of Candelaria, Quezon in the November 14, 1967 elections. Maliwanag was proclaimed the winner by 36 votes. Bolaños filed an election protest. Maliwanag moved for and was granted extensions of time to file his answer, with the final deadline set for January 6, 1968 [1, 2]. On that date, Maliwanag filed his answer which included a counter-protest. Respondent Judge Herrera, *motu proprio*, ordered the counter-protest stricken from the record, ruling that while the period to answer was extended, the statutory period for filing a counter-protest was not, rendering it late [2, 3]. The judge also disallowed Maliwanag's appeal on the ground that the order was interlocutory [4]. Maliwanag filed a petition for mandamus, which the Supreme Court treated as certiorari [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a counter-protest filed within the extended period granted for filing an answer is timely.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that a counter-protest is tantamount to a counterclaim in a civil action and may be presented as a part of the answer within the time the protestee is required to answer the protest [6]. Citing *Valenzuela v. Judge of the Court of First Instance of Bulacan* and *Torres v. Ribo*, the Court held that when a protestee is granted an extension of time to answer, a counter-protest filed within that extended period is deemed filed within the statutory limits [6, 7]. The trial court's order striking the counter-protest constituted a gross abuse of discretion. The order was set aside, and the case was remanded for further proceedings [8].
