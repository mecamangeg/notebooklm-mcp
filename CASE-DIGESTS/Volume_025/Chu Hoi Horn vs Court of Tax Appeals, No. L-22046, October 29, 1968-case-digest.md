I. CAPTION
CHU HOI HORN v. HON. COURT OF TAX APPEALS and COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-22046, October 29, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Chu Hoi Horn was engaged in the neon sign business. He previously paid taxes as a contractor under Sections 182 and 191 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) but filed a claim for refund in 1953, arguing he was merely a business agent subject to a lower fixed tax. Upon investigation, the Respondent Collector of Internal Revenue determined that Chu Hoi Horn was not leasing neon signs but selling them. Evidence revealed that the so-called "rentals" equaled the total cost of construction and installation, and ownership transferred to the customers (such as Oregon Hotel and Canada Cafe) upon full payment [1, 2]. Additionally, because the signs were custom-made and useless to others, a lease arrangement was deemed implausible [3, 4]. The Collector assessed a deficiency percentage tax of P21,622.91 under Section 185(k) of the NIRC [5]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the assessment, ruling the transactions were sales disguised as leases to evade taxes [4, 6]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the CTA's factual findings and legal conclusions.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the transaction regarding the neon signs was a contract of sale subject to sales tax, rather than a lease.
2. W/N the Supreme Court is bound by the factual findings of the Court of Tax Appeals.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held the transactions were sales subject to tax under Section 185(k) of the NIRC [7]. The Court found the "lease" contracts were attempts to evade tax liability, noting that the "rentals" covered the exact cost of the signs and transferred ownership upon completion [2]. Citing *Advertising Associates, Inc. v. Collector of Internal Revenue* (97 Phil. 636), the Court ruled that custom-made neon signs fall under Section 185(k); otherwise, the provision would be "futile" as such signs are never mass-produced for the general public [8, 9]. The Court emphasized that tax statutes must be construed to achieve their objective, not to be frustrated by technicalities [10].

2. **YES.** The Supreme Court is bound by the findings of facts of the Court of Tax Appeals, particularly when supported by substantial evidence [11]. The Court recognized the CTA's expertise in tax matters and declined to substitute its discretion on factual issues, leaving only questions of law for the Supreme Court's determination [12].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [10].
