I. CAPTION
J.M. TUASON & CO., INC. v. ATANACIO MUNAR, G.R. No. L-21544, September 30, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. is the registered owner of the Sta. Mesa Heights Subdivision covered by TCT No. 1267. On July 5, 1958, defendant Atanacio Munar allegedly entered a 150-square-meter portion of the land without the plaintiff's consent. The plaintiff filed an ejectment action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal.

In his answer, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff's Torrens title was void due to fraud. He further argued that his occupation was valid based on a 1953 compromise agreement between the plaintiff and the Deudors (defendant’s predecessors-in-interest), who had relinquished their claims to the land. The CFI ruled in favor of the plaintiff, ordering the defendant to vacate the premises and pay monthly rentals. The defendant failed to adduce evidence during the trial and merely manifested an intention to buy the property. He appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as the issues raised were purely legal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defendant can attack the validity of the plaintiff's Torrens title on the ground of fraud.
2. W/N the defendant can be considered a builder in good faith based on the claim of the Deudors.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the defendant is barred from assailing the decree of registration in favor of the plaintiff's predecessors. Citing *J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. v. Lumanlan*, the Court noted that the decree had been issued twenty years prior, and thus, the action to assail it is barred by the lapse of time [1].

2. **NO.** The defendant cannot claim to be a builder in good faith. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Tuason & Co. v. Macalindong*, stating that there is presumptive knowledge of the Torrens Titles issued to the plaintiff and its predecessors since 1914. Consequently, a buyer from the Deudors cannot, in good conscience, claim that they believed their vendor had ownership rights. The defendant ignored the Torrens title and relied on the Deudors' abandoned claim, and thus cannot pretend good faith [2, 3].

The judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED.
