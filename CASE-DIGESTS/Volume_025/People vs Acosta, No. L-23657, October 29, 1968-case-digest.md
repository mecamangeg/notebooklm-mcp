I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JUAN ACOSTA, LUCIANO DE LEON, and DOMINGO PIMENTEL, G.R. No. L-23657, October 29, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
The accused (Acosta, De Leon, and Pimentel) were charged with estafa for obtaining a ring valued at P16,500.00 from Pedro M. Miguel using a counterfeit dollar check [1, 2]. During trial, Miguel testified that the ring actually belonged to Banang Jaramillo and was only entrusted to him to be sold on commission [2]. After the prosecution rested its case, the defense moved to dismiss, arguing that Miguel, not being the owner, suffered no damage, thus negating an essential element of estafa [3]. The Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte dismissed the case, ruling that the information was defective for failing to name the real owner [4]. The Assistant Provincial Fiscal appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court, but the Solicitor General moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground of double jeopardy [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the government's appeal from the order of dismissal places the accused in double jeopardy.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that entertaining the appeal would place the accused in double jeopardy.

While the Court noted that the trial court grievously erred in dismissing the case—as an agent with juridical possession (like Miguel) can be the offended party in estafa because he is liable to the principal (*U.S. v. Almazan*; *U.S. v. Sotelo*) [5]—this error cannot be corrected by appeal. The accused were charged under a valid information before a competent court, had pleaded "not guilty," and the prosecution had rested. Consequently, the trial court's dismissal was on the merits and amounted to an acquittal. Under these circumstances, an appeal by the prosecution is barred [6].

The appeal is **DISMISSED** [7].
