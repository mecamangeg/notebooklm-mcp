I. CAPTION
ANSELMA PENDON, SANTIAGO PENISTAN, ET AL. v. HON. JOSE R. CABATUANDO and BLAS TRABASAS, G.R. No. L-21299, September 27, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Blas Trabasas, a tenant, filed a complaint for reinstatement against petitioner Anselma Pendon (landowner) in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). The hearing was set for October 17, 1962. Trabasas' counsel from the Tenancy Mediation Commission, Atty. Navarro, filed a motion for postponement due to a conflicting schedule in Cebu and assured Pendon's counsel, Atty. Rallon, that the hearing would definitely be postponed. Relying on this assurance and the motion, Pendon and her counsel did not appear. However, the hearing proceeded as scheduled with Trabasas and his original private counsel, Atty. Mabanag, present. The CAR rendered a decision ordering Trabasas' reinstatement. Pendon moved for a new trial, which was denied. Atty. Rallon attempted to appeal but filed the notice two days late because his office and records were destroyed by a fire. Pendon filed a petition for certiorari to annul the CAR decision [1-7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the motion for new trial given the misleading motion for postponement.
2. W/N the petition for certiorari is proper despite the petitioners' failure to perfect their appeal on time.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the motion for postponement filed by Atty. Navarro was deceptive and misleading because it implied Trabasas would be without counsel, when in fact his original counsel, Atty. Mabanag, was available and present at the hearing [8]. Furthermore, the CAR failed to resolve the motion for postponement promptly, despite having sufficient time, placing the petitioners' counsel in a difficult situation [9]. Allowing Trabasas to profit from a mistake committed by petitioners' counsel due to Trabasas' own misleading motion violates "elementary principles of fair play and due process" [10].

2. **YES.** While the general rule is that certiorari cannot be used as a substitute for a lost appeal, an exception applies when the failure to appeal within the prescribed period is due to "accident and excusable neglect" [11]. The Court found that the delay in the appeal was caused by the fire that destroyed counsel's records (a fortuitous event) and the confusion arising from the deceptive motion for postponement [7, 12].

The decision and resolution of the respondent Judge are declared null and void [12].
