I. CAPTION
TESTATE ESTATE OF THE LATE AGRIPINA J. VALDEZ. MARINA DIZON-RIVERA, executrix-appellee, v. ESTELA DIZON, TOMAS V. DIZON, BERNARDITA DIZON, JOSEFINA DIZON, ANGELINA DIZON AND LILIA DIZON, oppositors-appellants, G.R. No. L-28493, September 27, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Appellants (Estela Dizon, et al.) filed a motion for a 7th extension of time to file their brief. The Supreme Court granted this on July 8, 1968, extending the deadline to July 8, 1968, but included a specific warning that "no further extension will be given" [1]. On July 15, 1968—seven days after the expiration of the granted extension—appellants filed an 8th motion for another five-day extension [2]. On July 29, 1968, the Court denied this last motion and dismissed the appeal [3]. Appellants filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing the dismissal was premature as the Court had not yet received their explanation required by a show-cause order; this motion was denied on August 9, 1968 [3]. Appellants then filed the current Motion for Reconsideration [1]. The underlying appeal concerned the lower court's award of P12,000.00 in fees to the executrix, Dizon-Rivera, for an estate appraised at P1,809,569.77 [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed for failure to file the brief on time.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court denied the Motion for Reconsideration and maintained the dismissal of the appeal. The Court held that the appellants' 8th motion for extension was filed in violation of the warning contained in the resolution of July 8, 1968, that no further extension would be given, and was furthermore filed seven days late [4]. Additionally, the Court found the appeal itself to be without merit [4, 5]. The P12,000.00 fee awarded to the executrix was deemed reasonable given the services rendered and the substantial value of the estate (P1,809,569.77) [4].

The Motion for Reconsideration is denied [6].
