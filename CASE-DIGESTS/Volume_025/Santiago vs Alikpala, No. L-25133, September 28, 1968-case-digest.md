**I. CAPTION**
S/SGT. JOSE SANTIAGO v. LT. COL. CELSO ALIKPALA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25133, September 28, 1968, 25 SCRA 356, Fernando, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner S/Sgt. Santiago was summoned via telephone to appear before a General Court-Martial (GCM) on December 17, 1962, for arraignment on charges of violating the Articles of War. The purpose of the hurried arraignment was to avoid prescription of the offense, allegedly committed in 1960. The respondent GCM had been convened under Special Order No. 14 dated July 18, 1962, specifically to try the case of *People v. Capt. Egmidio Jose*. At the time of petitioner's arraignment, said Order did not authorize the GCM to try "such other cases which may be referred to it"; this phrase was only added by an amendment on January 8, 1963. Petitioner objected to the GCM's jurisdiction, arguing no special order designated it to try his case. The GCM overruled the objection and proceeded. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition. The lower court dismissed the petition as moot and academic because the GCM had already convicted the petitioner while the case was pending.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the General Court-Martial had jurisdiction to try the petitioner when the order convening it did not specifically designate it to try his case at the time of arraignment.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the General Court-Martial was not lawfully convened to try the petitioner and was therefore devoid of jurisdiction. Unlike courts of law, a court-martial is an agency of executive character, transient in duration, and a "creature of orders." It has only such powers as are expressly vested in it.

At the time of the petitioner's arraignment, the GCM was legally authorized only to try the case of Capt. Jose. The amendment extending its authority to "other cases" was made *after* the arraignment. Consequently, there was no competent court or tribunal validly in existence that could take cognizance of the charge against the petitioner at the crucial time. The Court ruled that the absence of a competent tribunal constitutes a denial of due process (*Banco Español-Filipino v. Palanca*). Where constitutional rights are disregarded, such as the right to due process, the court loses jurisdiction, and the proceedings are void (*Abriol v. Homeres*).

The order of the lower court is reversed, and the writs of certiorari and prohibition are granted, annulling the proceedings and decision of the respondent court-martial.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
**Castro, J.** (Concurring):
Noted that the arraignment was a "desperate measure" to interrupt the prescriptive period. He emphasized that a court-martial is not a permanent tribunal and that the subsequent amendment of the order could not validate an act that was *ab initio* a nullity. Vis-à-vis the petitioner, the GCM was "disembodied if not innominate."
