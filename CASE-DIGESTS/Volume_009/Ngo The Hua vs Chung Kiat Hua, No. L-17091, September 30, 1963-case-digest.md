I. CAPTION
NGO THE HUA, petitioner-appellant, v. CHUNG KIAT HUA, LILY CHUNG CHO, BONIFACIO CHUNG SIONG PEK and CHUNG KA BIO, oppositors-appellees; CHUNG KIAT KANG, oppositor-appellant, G.R. No. L-17091, September 30, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Chung Liu, a Chinese citizen, died, and Special Proceeding No. 1552-P was filed in the Court of First Instance of Rizal to settle his estate. Petitioner Ngo The Hua claimed to be the surviving spouse, while oppositors-appellees Chung Kiat Hua, Lily Chung Cho, Bonifacio Chung Siong Pek, and Chung Ka Bio claimed to be the children of the deceased. Oppositor-appellant Chung Kiat Kang also contested the proceedings.

The lower court found that Ngo The Hua had been validly divorced from the deceased by the Taipei District Court and that the oppositors-appellees were the true children of the deceased. Consequently, the court appointed Chung Kiat Hua as administrator. Ngo The Hua and Chung Kiat Kang appealed, but Ngo The Hua later withdrew her appeal after a settlement. Chung Kiat Kang argued that the lower court erred in passing upon the filiation of the parties and the validity of the divorce before the estate's debts were paid, claiming this constituted a premature declaration of heirs. He also sought to be appointed co-administrator.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court erred in determining the relationship of the parties prior to the payment of estate obligations.
2. W/N Chung Kiat Kang has the legal interest required to intervene or be appointed co-administrator.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The prohibition in Section 1, Rule 91 of the Rules of Court against the distribution of the residue of the estate before obligations are paid does not enjoin the court from determining relationships for other purposes. In this case, the court did not purport to make a declaration of heirs for distribution. Rather, it determined the relationship of the parties to establish the order of preference for the appointment of an administrator under Section 5, Rule 79 of the Rules of Court (which prioritizes the surviving spouse and next of kin). Necessarily, the court had to verify the truth of the parties' claims to these relationships to apply the rule. This finding is not a final determination of heirship for the decree of distribution.

2. **NO.** To intervene in an administration proceeding, a person must be an "interested party," defined as one who would be benefited by the estate, such as an heir or a creditor. Chung Kiat Kang does not claim to be a creditor. Furthermore, under the Civil Code of the Republic of China—which applies in this case pursuant to Article 16 of the New Civil Code regarding the national law of the deceased—he is not an heir. Having no interest in the estate, he cannot be appointed co-administrator.

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
