I. CAPTION
PASTOR B. CONSTANTINO v. BLAS AQUINO and EUFEMIA POLICARPIO, G.R. No. L-16216, December 28, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Constantino and Respondents Aquino and Policarpio entered into a real estate mortgage to secure several loans [1, 2]. When Respondents failed to pay, Petitioner filed an action for "Foreclosure of Mortgage" [2]. The trial court rendered judgment ordering Respondents to pay the principal sums with interest, but the decision failed to include an order requiring payment into court within 90 days as prescribed by the Rules of Court [3, 4].

Upon Petitioner's motion, a writ of execution was issued, the property was sold at auction to Petitioner, and the sale was confirmed by the trial court [5]. Respondents subsequently filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the execution was void because the court never issued the required order granting them 90 days to pay the debt [4]. The trial court granted the motion, ruling that the execution was premature and null void, and suspended the effects of the sale confirmation [6]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that since more than 90 days had passed since the judgment was rendered, the requirement was substantially complied with [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court's failure to expressly order the mortgagor to pay the debt within 90 days renders the subsequent writ of execution and foreclosure sale void.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the 90-day period provided in Section 2, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court is a substantive requirement that cannot be omitted [8, 9]. This period constitutes a substantive right granted to the mortgage debtor as their last opportunity to pay the debt and save the property (equity of redemption) [9]. The Rules dictate that this period is counted "from the date of the service of the order" directing payment; thus, if no such order is included in the judgment, the period does not commence [10, 11].

Citing *Ponce de Leon v. Ibañez* and *Diaz v. Mendezona*, the Court ruled that a judgment in a foreclosure action can only be executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules [9, 12]. Consequently, the writ of execution issued without the 90-day order was premature and void [12].

Appeal dismissed; orders affirmed.
