I. CAPTION
FILOMENA CUSTODIO, ET AL. v. FILOMENA CASIANO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18977, December 27, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Isaac Custodio purchased a parcel of land in Cavite from the Caridad Estate in 1922 on installment. He died in 1927 before the title was issued. His daughter, Alejandra, paid the remaining balance. Upon the suggestion of the estate manager and with the agreement of the sisters, the title (TCT No. 5800) was issued in 1928 in the name of their brother, Ciriaco Custodio, as he was the only male in the family. However, it was understood that Ciriaco would hold the title as a trustee for his co-heirs. Ciriaco never possessed the land; his sisters maintained possession. The certificate of title remained with Alejandra and later an uncle, and was only given to Ciriaco's widow, Filomena Casiano, in 1951 for a specific transaction.

When the petitioners (children of Ciriaco's sisters) discovered that Ciriaco's widow and children (respondents) intended to sell the land, they filed a complaint for recovery of their shares. The trial court ruled in favor of the petitioners, declaring them co-owners and ordering the cancellation of the title. The Court of Appeals reversed this decision, ruling that the petitioners' right of action was barred by prescription and laches, as 25 years had elapsed since the registration of the land in Ciriaco’s name.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners' action for recovery of their shares is barred by prescription or laches.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and reinstated the trial court's decision.

The Court held that a trust relationship existed. The evidence proved that Ciriaco merely acted as a trustee for his sisters when the title was issued in his name, a fact he acknowledged during his lifetime. Under the principle of co-ownership and trust, the registration of land in the name of one co-heir does not bar the other co-heirs from recovering their shares if the registered owner holds the title in a trust capacity and has not repudiated said trust. Consequently, the action is not barred by prescription despite the lapse of 25 years [1, 2].

Furthermore, the defense of laches was untenable because its requisites were not present. Specifically, the petitioners did not delay in asserting their rights; they took action immediately upon learning of the respondents' conduct. Nor could the respondents claim lack of knowledge of the petitioners' rights or prejudice, as they were aware of the trust relationship established by their predecessor-in-interest [3, 4].

The petition was granted, and the decision of the trial court dated April 2, 1956, was revived.
