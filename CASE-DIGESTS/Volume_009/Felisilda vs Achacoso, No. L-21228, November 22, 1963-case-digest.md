I. CAPTION
NICETAS FELISILDA v. CRISPULO ACHACOSO, G.R. No. L-21228, November 22, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
In the November 10, 1959 general elections for municipal mayor of Duero, Bohol, petitioner Nicetas Felisilda was proclaimed the winner with 1,569 votes against respondent Crispulo Achacoso's 1,509 votes [1]. Achacoso filed an election protest in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bohol, alleging marked ballots were counted for Felisilda. Felisilda counter-protested [1]. The CFI ruled in favor of Achacoso, declaring him the winner by 96 votes [2]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) modified the decision but still declared Achacoso the winner with a reduced plurality of 12 votes [2]. Felisilda appealed to the Supreme Court, contending the CA erred in invalidating ballots with prefixes, mishandling specific ballots, and counting a ballot with only a nickname [2]-[3]. The trial court had previously disregarded testimonial evidence explaining the marks because it was introduced only after the ballots were examined by the commissioners [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N ballots containing prefixes such as "Nong," "Parie," "Don," "Mr.," and "Sr." are marked and invalid.
2. W/N a ballot containing only the nickname of a candidate is valid.
3. W/N the Supreme Court may review errors regarding ballots that were not raised in the Court of Appeals.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Prefixes before the names of candidates are not considered identifying marks on the ballots in the absence of valid evidence *aliunde* to support such a claim [4]. The Court held that testimonial evidence introduced after the ballots were examined by the commissioners and parties is unreliable, as it appears to be a mere afterthought to suit what appeared on the ballots [5], [6]. Consequently, ballots with prefixes like "Nong," "Parie," "Don," "Mr.," and "Sr." were ruled valid and counted for the petitioner [7]-[8].

2. **NO.** A ballot containing only the nickname of a candidate cannot be counted in his favor unless accompanied by either his name or surname [4]. Under Section 129(9) of the Revised Election Code, the ballot containing only the word "Polo" (Achacoso's nickname) was invalid and should have been deducted from the respondent's votes [9].

3. **NO.** Although an election protest appeal throws the entire case open, it is the duty of the interested party to call the appellate court's attention to specific matters [10], [11]. The Supreme Court ruled that the petitioner could not assail the CA's inaction on 30 disallowed ballots for the first time in the petition for certiorari when this point was not raised or assigned as an error in the CA [11].

The decision of the Court of Appeals was **REVERSED** [12].
