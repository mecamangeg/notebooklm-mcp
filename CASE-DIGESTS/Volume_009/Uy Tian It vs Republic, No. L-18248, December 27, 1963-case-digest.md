I. CAPTION
PETITION FOR NATURALIZATION OF UY TIAN IT (PETER UY LORENZO) v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18248, December 27, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Uy Tian It (alias Peter Uy Lorenzo) filed an application for naturalization, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Manila [1, 2]. The Republic appealed, arguing inter alia that the petitioner failed to prove he conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner [2, 3]. Petitioner’s residence in the Philippines began in 1946 [4]. To prove his good character, he presented two witnesses: Severino Santos, a bank employee who met him in 1949, and Dr. David S. Cabreira, a medical examiner who met him in 1948 [3, 4]. Both witnesses knew the petitioner primarily as customers buying gifts at his store, through banking transactions, and from meeting at occasional social gatherings [3, 4]. Their belief in his good conduct was based mainly on their lack of knowledge of any criminal charges or untoward acts committed by him [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner satisfied the requirement of establishing irreproachable conduct through competent witnesses during the entire period of his residence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. Section 2, third paragraph of Commonwealth Act No. 473 requires an applicant to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner "during the entire period of his residence in the Philippines" [4]. The Court held that the petitioner failed to meet this requirement. First, the witnesses only knew him starting in 1948 and 1949, leaving a gap from the start of his residence in 1946 [4]. Second, the nature of the relationship—based on business transactions and casual social encounters—did not qualify the witnesses to make a competent assessment of his moral character [5]. Finally, the witnesses' testimony was insufficient as it relied on a negative premise (lack of knowledge of bad acts) rather than affirmatively establishing irreproachable conduct [5]. The petition for naturalization was **DISMISSED** [6].
