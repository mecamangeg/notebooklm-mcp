I. CAPTION
ROBERTO V. MERRERA v. HON. JUAN R. LIWAG, LEON G. JAYME and ALFONSO CASTILLO, G.R. No. L-20079, September 30, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Roberto V. Merrera was appointed as the Auxiliary Justice of the Peace of Binmaley, Pangasinan. The Secretary of Justice recommended him for the position as early as September 9, 1961, and his appointment was extended on November 6, 1961, before election day [1]. He qualified and entered upon the discharge of his functions days before the "scramble" in Malacañang involving mass "midnight appointments" by the outgoing President [1].

However, following the issuance of Administrative Order No. 2, which revoked ad interim appointments released around December 29, 1961, the petitioner desisted from holding office in obedience to the order of the Secretary of Justice [2], [3]. Merrera filed an original petition for Mandamus to compel the respondents to pay his salary for the periods he claimed to be entitled to the office [4]. The main contention was whether his appointment fell under the prohibition against "midnight appointments" established in *Aytona v. Castillo* [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioner's appointment is valid and outside the prohibited "midnight appointments" under the *Aytona v. Castillo* ruling.
2. W/N petitioner's desistance from holding office constitutes abandonment or laches.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the appointment was valid. The Court distinguished this case from *Aytona v. Castillo*, noting that the *Aytona* ruling cautioned against overstretching its effect beyond the "extreme and extraordinary circumstances" of that case (i.e., mass appointments during a "scramble" in Malacañang) [5], [3]. The Court applied the qualification in *Aytona* which allows the filling of vacancies if they are "few, and so spaced as to afford some assurance of deliberate action and careful consideration of the need for the appointment and the appointee’s qualifications" [5], [6]. Merrera's appointment met these criteria: there was a verified need for the position, he was recommended months in advance, and the appointment was extended deliberately on November 6, 1961, well before the chaotic "midnight" period [1], [6].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner's desistance did not constitute laches or abandonment. His decision to stop holding office was a "gesture of respect to the authorities" and an act of obedience to the Secretary of Justice's order [2]. Since he consistently insisted on his right to the office, his attitude was deemed "worthy of praise" rather than condemnation as it evinced his character as a "man of law" [2], [7].

**Petition granted.** Petitioner is declared entitled to the position and the respondents are directed to pay his salary [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Bautista Angelo, J. (Dissenting):** Dissented based on his opinion in the *Aytona* case [9].
**Padilla, J. (Dissenting):** Dissented for the same reasons stated in *Aytona*, but opined that petitioner is entitled to salary from December 27 to 29, 1961 [9].
