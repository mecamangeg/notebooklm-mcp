I. CAPTION
ANTONIO M. PATERNO, ET AL. v. JOSE V. SALUD, G.R. No. L-15620, September 30, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Antonio Paterno and Margarita Paterno Vda. de Javier filed an action to recover a 5-hectare parcel of land in San Juan de Bolbok, Batangas, claiming ownership through their predecessor, Jose T. Paterno. They alleged that Jose bought the land at a 1912 auction sale pursuant to a levy against Esteban de Villa. The auction deed described "Parcel No. 5" as having an area of only 1,200 square meters. However, Petitioners claimed that a 1924 survey revealed the actual area was 30.5285 hectares, which included the subject property.

Respondent Jose V. Salud claimed ownership by inheritance from his mother, Pia de Villa (not Esteban), and had obtained a Torrens title over the land in 1948. He also filed a counterclaim for the reconveyance of a separate 1.5-hectare strip of land registered in Petitioners' name.

The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Petitioners, ordering the reconveyance of the 5-hectare land and dismissing the counterclaim. The Court of Appeals reversed this decision, dismissing Petitioners' complaint and ordering them to reconvey the 1.5-hectare counterclaim land to Respondent. Petitioners appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the area stated in the 1912 auction sale document should prevail over the boundaries claimed by Petitioners to justify their ownership of the 5-hectare land.
2. W/N the Respondent is entitled to the reconveyance of the 1.5-hectare land subject of his counterclaim.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that while boundaries generally prevail over area in identifying land, this rule applies only when boundaries are "sufficiently certain" and the identity of the land is clearly proved [1]. Here, the discrepancy between the stated area (1,200 sq.m.) and the claimed area (30.5285 hectares) is so great—the latter being 250 times bigger—that the erroneous statement cannot be simply disregarded [2]. The natural boundaries were identical only on the north and south, but not on the east and west [2]. Furthermore, evidence showed the 1912 auction involved properties of *Esteban* de Villa, whereas the subject land belonged to *Pia* de Villa [3]. Thus, the area stated in the document must be followed, and Petitioners failed to prove ownership of the 5-hectare tract [4].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that Respondent is not entitled to reconveyance. The 1.5-hectare land was registered under Original Certificate of Title No. 4918 in the name of Petitioners’ predecessor since 1928 [5]. Respondent only sought reconveyance in his answer on November 19, 1952 [6]. Since there was no proof of irregularity or fraud in the issuance of the title, and the one-year period to claim intrinsic fraud had long expired, the Petitioners' title became indefeasible under Section 38 of Act No. 496 [5, 7].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **MODIFIED**. The dismissal of the Petitioners' complaint is affirmed, but the order for Petitioners to reconvey the 1.5-hectare land to Respondent is reversed.
