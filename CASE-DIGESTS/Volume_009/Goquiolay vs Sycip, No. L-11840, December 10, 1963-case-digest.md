I. CAPTION
ANTONIO C. GOQUIOLAY, ET AL. v. WASHINGTON Z. SYCIP, ET AL., G.R. No. L-11840, December 10, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In 1940, Antonio Goquiolay and Tan Sin An formed a general partnership to engage in the buying and selling of real estate. Tan Sin An was the managing partner. He died in 1942, and his widow, Kong Chai Pin, was appointed administratrix of his estate. In 1949, Kong Chai Pin, acting as administratrix and managing partner, sold three parcels of partnership land to Washington Sycip and Betty Lee to pay the partnership's debts. Goquiolay challenged the validity of the sale, arguing that as an heir, the widow was merely a limited partner and thus legally incapacitated to manage or alienate partnership property [1]. He further alleged that the sale was fraudulent and the price inadequate. The Supreme Court previously upheld the sale in a 1960 decision. Goquiolay filed this Motion for Reconsideration, insisting the widow never became a general partner.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the widow Kong Chai Pin became a general partner with authority to manage and bind the partnership.
2. W/N the sale of the partnership's real properties was valid and within the ordinary powers of a managing partner.
3. W/N the sale may be rescinded on the ground of fraud or inadequacy of price.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While an heir ordinarily becomes a limited partner to avoid unlimited liability, they may elect to become a general partner [2]. By authorizing the widow to manage partnership property—an act prohibited for limited partners under Article 148 of the Code of Commerce—Goquiolay recognized her as a general partner and is now estopped from denying her authority [3-5]. Strangers dealing with the partnership had the right to presume she had the requisite authority, especially given Goquiolay’s seven-year inaction and failure to repudiate her management [6-8].

2. **YES.** Since the express purpose of the partnership was to "buy and sell real estate," the lands acquired were considered stock-in-trade, not capital assets or business sites [9]. Consequently, the sale of these immovables was in pursuance of partnership purposes and within the ordinary powers of a partner, even without the consent of the other partners [10, 11]. The Court distinguished this from cases where selling the business site would terminate the partnership, noting here the sale was to pay legitimate debts [12].

3. **NO.** Relationship alone is not a badge of fraud [13]. The price was not grossly inadequate considering it was practically a forced sale to settle debts [14, 15]. Furthermore, the action for rescission is subsidiary; Goquiolay failed to allege or prove that he could not obtain reparation from the widow and heirs of the deceased partner, which is a requisite under Article 1294 of the Civil Code of 1889 (Article 1383, New Civil Code) [16, 17].

The Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Bautista Angelo, J., Dissenting:**
Justice Bautista Angelo, joined by Justices Labrador, Paredes, and Makalintal, voted to grant the motion. He argued that: (1) Acts of management by the widow were not clearly proven and were denied by the buyers themselves [18]; (2) Mere acceptance of inheritance does not make an heir a general partner; they must expressly declare such status [19, 20]; (3) Even as a manager, she could not sell strict ownership acts without express authority (agency principles applied to partnership) [21]; and (4) The sale was fraudulent, sold to close relatives at a low price while excluding Goquiolay [22, 23].
