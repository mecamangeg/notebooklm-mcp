I. CAPTION
LA MALLORCA and PAMPANGA BUS COMPANY, INC. v. CIRILO D. MENDIOLA, G.R. No. L-19558, November 29, 1963, J.B.L. Reyes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners La Mallorca and Pampanga Bus Co., Inc. appealed a decision of the Public Service Commission (PSC) granting a certificate of public convenience to respondent Mendiola. While the records were in the possession of the PSC, petitioners' Exhibits D, D-1, and D-1-a to D-1-d were lost and could not be reconstituted. These exhibits were observation reports of motor vehicles operating on the Guagua-San Fernando line, submitted by petitioners to rebut the respondent's evidence regarding passenger volume. Consequently, petitioners filed a motion to set aside the decision and remand the records to the PSC for a new trial, arguing the loss of evidence prejudiced their appeal [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the loss of petitioners' rebuttal exhibits justifies setting aside the PSC decision and remanding the case for a new trial.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court denied the motion to set aside and remand. The Court reasoned that there was no proof that the lost exhibits were not duly considered by the PSC when it rendered the decision under appeal. The Commission explicitly stated that its findings—that the current number of vehicles was insufficient to cope with the number of passengers—were based "from the mass of evidence" established [2, 3].

Furthermore, under the established rule in cases of this nature, the Supreme Court is not authorized to weigh conflicting evidence or substitute its own conclusions for those of the PSC (*Halili v. Isip*; *Ice & Cold Storage Industries v. Valero*) [3]. The sole mission of the Court is to ascertain whether it clearly appears that there was evidence before the Commission to reasonably support the decision [3, 4]. This determination primarily depends on the character of the applicant's (respondent's) evidence, which had not been lost [3].

Petitioners' motion to set aside and remand was denied, and they were required to file their brief [5].
