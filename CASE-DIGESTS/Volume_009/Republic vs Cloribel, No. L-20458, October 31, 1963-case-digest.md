**I. CAPTION**
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL, et al., G.R. No. L-20458, October 31, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Vicente Kho, an alien, was found by the Deportation Board to have willfully evaded payment of over one million pesos in taxes [1, 2]. Following the Board's recommendation, the President issued a deportation order on August 22, 1962, resulting in Kho's arrest and custody [3]. Kho filed a petition for *habeas corpus* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, presided by Judge Cloribel, to test the legality of his arrest and subsequently applied for bail [3]. Despite the Solicitor General's objection, Judge Cloribel granted the petition for bail [3]. The Republic filed this special civil action to challenge the legality of the lower court's order granting bail, and the Supreme Court issued an injunction to prevent Kho's release [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance has the power to release on bail an alien detained for deportation pursuant to an order of the President.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that when an alien is detained by the Bureau of Immigration for deportation pursuant to an order of deportation by the Deportation Board or the President, the Courts of First Instance lack the power to release such alien on bail, even in *habeas corpus* proceedings, because there is no law authorizing it [4]. The Court relied on the doctrine established in *Bengzon vs. Ocampo* (84 Phil. 611) and *Ong See Sang vs. Commissioner of Immigration* (G.R. No. L-9700) [4]. Furthermore, the Court noted that the claim by Kho's counsel that the President had suspended the deportation order was unfounded and based on a misconstrued telegram [5].

The order granting bail was **ANNULLED** and the injunction previously issued was made **PERMANENT** [6].
