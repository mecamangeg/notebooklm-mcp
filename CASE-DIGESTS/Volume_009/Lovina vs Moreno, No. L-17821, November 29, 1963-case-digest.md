I. CAPTION
PRIMITIVO LOVINA and NELLY MONTILLA v. HON. FLORENCIO MORENO, as Secretary of Public Works and Communications, and BENJAMIN YONZON, G.R. No. L-17821, November 29, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Residents of Macabebe, Pampanga, complained to the Secretary of Public Works and Communications (Moreno) that spouses Lovina and Montilla blocked "Sapang Bulati," a navigable river traversing their fishpond, in violation of Republic Act No. 2056. After notice and hearing, the Secretary found the dams and dikes to be public nuisances in navigable waters and ordered the spouses to remove them [1]. The spouses filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to restrain the Secretary, arguing that RA 2056 is unconstitutional for unlawfully delegating judicial power (determining the public nature of the river and nuisance) to an executive officer [2, 3]. They also argued their Torrens title proved the creek was private [4]. The CFI granted a permanent injunction, declaring RA 2056 unconstitutional and ruling the creek non-navigable based on the registration plan [5, 6]. Secretary Moreno appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N RA 2056 is unconstitutional for unlawfully delegating judicial power to the Secretary of Public Works.
2. W/N the issuance of a Torrens title precludes the determination that a navigable stream exists within the registered property.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** RA 2056 is constitutional and does not constitute an unlawful delegation of judicial power [7]. The Act empowers the Secretary to clear navigable streams of unauthorized obstructions. Although this involves determining questions of fact (such as the existence and navigability of the stream), such functions are incidental to the executive power granted by law and are validly conferrable upon executive officials [8]. The Act satisfies due process by expressly requiring notice and opportunity to be heard [8]. The Court cited *Palanca v. Commonwealth* and U.S. "Bridge cases" to show that administrative fact-finding incidental to executive duties is not a violation of the principle of separation of powers [7, 9].

2. **NO.** The issuance of a Torrens title does not confer ownership of navigable streams within the registered property, nor is it conclusive evidence of their non-existence unless the boundaries are expressly delimited in the registration plan [6, 10]. Navigable streams are public property and ownership cannot be acquired by prescription or adverse possession [7, 11]. Consequently, the Secretary's factual finding that "Sapang Bulati" was a navigable stream, supported by substantial evidence, must be respected in the absence of fraud, error of law, or grave abuse of discretion [10, 12].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the writs of injunction issued therein are **ANNULLED and SET ASIDE** [11].
