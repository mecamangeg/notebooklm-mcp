I. CAPTION
ISIDRO C. ANG-ANGCO v. HON. NATALIO P. CASTILLO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17169, November 30, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Isidro Ang-Angco, the Collector of Customs, was charged administratively for releasing Pepsi-Cola concentrates without the requisite Central Bank release certificate, albeit with the verbal approval of the Secretary of Finance. An investigating committee recommended a 15-day suspension. However, three years later, respondent Executive Secretary Natalio Castillo, by authority of the President, rendered a decision finding petitioner guilty of conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service and considering him resigned with prejudice to reinstatement. Petitioner challenged this, arguing that under the Civil Service Act of 1959 (R.A. No. 2260), jurisdiction over administrative cases of classified civil service employees lies with the Commissioner of Civil Service, not the President. He claimed the President's direct action deprived him of due process and his right to appeal to the Civil Service Board of Appeals.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the President has the power to take direct disciplinary action to remove an official in the classified civil service, bypassing the Commissioner of Civil Service.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the action taken by the Executive Secretary was contrary to law. Under Section 16(i) of the Civil Service Act of 1959, the Commissioner of Civil Service has original and exclusive jurisdiction to decide administrative cases of all officers and employees in the classified service [1, 2]. The law does not provide for an appeal to the President, nor does it grant him the power to review decisions *motu proprio*, unlike the repealed Commonwealth Act No. 598 [2, 3].

While the Constitution grants the President control over the executive department, the Court, citing *Hebron v. Reyes*, held that this power is limited to altering or modifying the *acts* of subordinates, not the power to remove the *actor* himself [4, 5]. For classified employees, the power to remove is not inherent in the power to appoint but must be exercised "for cause as provided by law" (Art. XII, Sec. 4, Constitution) [6, 7]. Consequently, the President's power to remove is subject to the procedures established by Congress in the Civil Service Law [7, 8].

**Disposition:** The petition was **GRANTED**. Petitioner’s reinstatement was ordered without prejudice to submitting his case to the Civil Service Commissioner to be dealt with in accordance with law [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Bengzon, C.J., and Justices Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred with the decision [10].
