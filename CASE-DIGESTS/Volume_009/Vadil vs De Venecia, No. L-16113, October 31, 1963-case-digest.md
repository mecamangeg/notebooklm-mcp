I. CAPTION
VICTOR VADIL, ET AL. v. HON. JOSE R. DE VENECIA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16113, October 31, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Pablo Española Estate, Inc. filed a collection suit against Raymundo Guinsatao and applied for a writ of preliminary attachment. The trial court directed the filing of a bond to answer for the judgment. However, the bond actually executed by Guinsatao and the petitioners (as sureties) provided that they would pay "all the costs which may be awarded to the *defendant*, and all the damages that the *defendant* may suffer by reason of the Writ of Preliminary Attachment," should it be adjudged that the writ was obtained without cause. No writ of attachment was actually issued. After the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the Estate and execution against Guinsatao returned unsatisfied, the court ordered the execution of the petitioners' bond.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner-sureties are liable on the bond.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the sureties are not liable. Sureties are favorites of the law; assuming obligations often without material gain, all presumptions are indulged in their favor (*People v. De la Cruz*). The specific bond filed conditioned liability upon the issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Attachment and damages resulting therefrom. Since no writ of attachment was actually issued by the court, the obligation premised on such issuance did not arise. Furthermore, the bond terms as written were to indemnify the defendant, not the plaintiff. The petition was granted, and the order and writ of execution against the bond were set aside.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**J.B.L. Reyes, J.** concurred, emphasizing that no writ of attachment was issued and that the sureties were not heard before the final judgment. **Barrera, J.** joined this opinion. **Dizon** and **Makalintal, JJ.** concurred in the result.
