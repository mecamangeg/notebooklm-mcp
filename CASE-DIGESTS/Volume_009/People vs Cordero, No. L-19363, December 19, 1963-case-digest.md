I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ARNALDO CORDERO and MANILA SURETY & FIDELITY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-19363, December 19, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On September 28, 1954, Arnaldo Cordero was charged with a violation of the Revised Administrative Code. Manila Surety & Fidelity Co., Inc. posted a bail bond of P2,000.00 for his provisional liberty [1]. On February 3, 1955, Cordero failed to appear for his arraignment, prompting the trial court to order the confiscation of the bond and his arrest [2].

On May 27, 1958, more than three years later, the trial court rendered judgment against the bond for P2,000.00 upon motion of the Fiscal [2, 3]. A writ of execution was subsequently issued and served on the surety on August 15, 1961 [3]. On September 16, 1961, the surety filed a motion to set aside the writ, arguing that: (1) the accused had died on May 20, 1957, extinguishing his liability; and (2) the court failed to give the surety the required 30-day period to produce the body of the accused and show cause why judgment should not be rendered [4, 5]. The lower court denied the motion, and the surety appealed [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the death of the accused after the confiscation of the bond but before judgment relieves the surety of liability.
2. W/N the failure of the trial court to give the surety 30 days to show cause invalidates the judgment against the bond.
3. W/N the appeal was perfected on time.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The bail bond was breached when the surety failed to make the accused appear for arraignment on February 3, 1955 [7]. The subsequent illness and death of the accused three years later (May 20, 1957) could not excuse the prior breach of the conditions of the bond [7]. The Court noted that the surety maintained no proper supervision over the accused, as it did not even know of his death until 1961, six years after the default [7].

2. **NO.** Although the lower court did not strictly conform to the Rules of Court by failing to give the surety 30 days to show cause, the surety is barred by laches [8]. The surety was served a copy of the Fiscal's motion for judgment in May 1958 but made no move to oppose it or plead the violation of the Rules for over three years until execution was issued [8]. This laches cured whatever irregularity arose from the court's failure to grant the opportunity to show cause [8].

3. **NO.** The period to perfect an appeal from an order of execution of a judgment of forfeiture is only fifteen (15) days from notice of the order [9]. In this case, even after deducting the time the motion to set aside was pending, forty (40) days had elapsed from the service of the writ of execution to the filing of the notice of appeal [9]. Consequently, the order of execution had become final and unappealable.

**Order affirmed.** [10]
