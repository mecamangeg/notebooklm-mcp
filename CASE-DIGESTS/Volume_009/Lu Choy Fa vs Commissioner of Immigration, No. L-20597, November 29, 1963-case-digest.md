**I. CAPTION**
LU CHOY FA, ET AL. v. COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION, G.R. No. L-20597, November 29, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners Lu Choy Fa and her minor children arrived in the Philippines on November 18, 1961, as temporary visitors authorized to stay for two months. Ong Tai, Lu Choy Fa's husband, posted a cash bond for their stay. The respondent Commissioner of Immigration granted multiple extensions, the last of which expired on April 15, 1962. Meanwhile, on December 27, 1961, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila granted Ong Tai’s petition for naturalization. Anticipating Ong Tai’s citizenship would become final after the statutory two-year probationary period, petitioners sought to extend their stay until December 1963. The respondent refused to extend their stay beyond April 15, 1962. Petitioners filed a case for prohibition and injunction with the CFI of Manila to stop their deportation and the confiscation of their bond. The CFI denied the petition, ruling that their right to stay had expired.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioners are entitled to extend their stay as temporary visitors based on the husband's granted (but not yet final) petition for naturalization.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that a temporary visitor acquires no right to remain in the Philippines beyond the authorized period. Upon the visa's expiration, the Commissioner of Immigration has the inescapable duty to expel the alien [1, 2].

The Court applied the doctrine in *Kua Suy v. Commissioner of Immigration*, holding that a favorable decision in a naturalization case does not automatically vest citizenship; the applicant must first complete the two-year probationary period. Consequently, a mere naturalization decree does not grant the applicant's wife and children the right to remain in the country beyond the time set in their entry visas [2]. The Court also noted that if the petitioners intended to stay permanently from the beginning to await the husband's naturalization, their application for temporary visas constituted fraud, denying them any right to favorable treatment [3, 4].

Decision affirmed.
