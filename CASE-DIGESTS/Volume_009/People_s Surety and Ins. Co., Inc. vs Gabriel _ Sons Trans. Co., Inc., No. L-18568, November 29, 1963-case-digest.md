I. CAPTION
PEOPLE’S SURETY AND INSURANCE COMPANY, INC. v. GABRIEL & SONS TRANSPORTATION COMPANY, INC., ANTONIO P. GABRIEL, SABINO DAVID and ANTONIO VILLARAMA, G.R. No. L-18568, November 29, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On October 28, 1954, Gabriel & Sons Transportation Co. (Transportation Co.) entered into a stevedoring contract with Luzon Stevedoring Co., which required a P38,400 performance bond. On the same date, Transportation Co. secured **Surety Bond Exhibit A** (P38,400) from People’s Surety and Insurance Co. (People’s Surety). In consideration of this, Antonio Gabriel and Antonio Villarama executed **Indemnity Agreement Exhibit D**, binding themselves to indemnify People's Surety for losses under said bond. Subsequently, on November 17, 1954, Transportation Co. secured a second **Surety Bond Exhibit B** (P9,600) from People’s Surety.

Transportation Co. defaulted on its obligations. Luzon Stevedoring sued People’s Surety and recovered judgment, which People's Surety paid. People’s Surety then filed this suit for reimbursement against Transportation Co., Gabriel, and Villarama. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of People’s Surety, holding Gabriel and Villarama liable under Exhibit D for losses arising from the second bond (Exhibit B), citing a printed clause regarding "any other" bond. The trial court also ruled that a P38,400 payment Gabriel made to Luzon Stevedoring should be applied proportionally to the aggregate of both bonds. Gabriel and Villarama appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the indemnity agreement (Exhibit D) executed for the first bond covers the second surety bond (Exhibit B).
2. W/N the payment of P38,400 made by Gabriel should be applied solely to the obligation under the first surety bond (Exhibit A).

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the indemnitors are not liable for the second bond. The indemnity agreement was a printed form prepared by the plaintiff, and any ambiguity must be construed against the drafter. The agreement expressly stated it was in consideration of the P38,400 bond (Exhibit A), which was attached as an integral part. The failure to fill in the blank spaces in the clause referring to "any other... bond" indicated the parties did not intend to extend coverage to other obligations. Furthermore, the plaintiff’s own clerk testified that the second bond was not covered by any indemnity agreement [1-3].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled the payment applied solely to the first bond. Under **Article 1252 of the Civil Code**, a debtor with several obligations may specify to which debt payment is applied. Gabriel testified the payment was for the P38,400 bond (Exhibit A), and the amount paid matched that bond exactly. Even without specification, the rules on application of payment dictate it be applied to the more onerous obligation. The first bond (Exhibit A) was more onerous because it was older and guaranteed by indemnity agreements, whereas the second bond (Exhibit B) was not guaranteed [4].

**Disposition:** The decision appealed from is **MODIFIED** by eliminating the judgment against appellants Villarama and Gabriel. In all other respects, the decision is **AFFIRMED**.
