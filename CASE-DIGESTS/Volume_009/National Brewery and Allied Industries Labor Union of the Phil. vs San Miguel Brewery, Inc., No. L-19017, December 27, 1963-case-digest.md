I. CAPTION
NATIONAL BREWERY AND ALLIED INDUSTRIES LABOR UNION OF THE PHILIPPINES (PAFLU) v. SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC., G.R. No. L-19017, December 27, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On October 2, 1959, petitioner Union and respondent Company entered into a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Section 7, Article VII of the CBA provided that the Company would pay the basic daily rates of workers participating in the Labor Day parade on May 1 [1]. On May 1, 1960, about 600 Union members participated in the parade, with total claims amounting to P3,900.00. When the Company refused to pay, the Union filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila for collection of the sum and damages [1].

The Company moved to dismiss, arguing that the Union was not the real party in interest, but rather the individual employees were, and that the CFI lacked jurisdiction because the individual claims did not meet the jurisdictional amount [2, 3]. The CFI ordered the Union to amend the complaint to include the individual employees as plaintiffs. When the Union failed to amend, the CFI dismissed the complaint [4]. The Union appealed, arguing the suit was based on the CBA, not individual employment contracts [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Union may sue for the enforcement of the CBA provision regarding Labor Day wages without joining the individual members as plaintiffs.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the complaint is based directly on the collective bargaining agreement concluded between the Union and the Company, not on individual contracts of employment [7]. The right of the members to be paid for the Labor Day parade was recognized only when the CBA was concluded; thus, the basis of the right sought to be enforced is the agreement itself [7].

Under **Section 3, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court**, a party with whom or in whose name a contract has been made for the benefit of another may sue without joining the beneficiary [8]. Since the Union is the party with whom the CBA was entered into for the benefit of its members, it may sue thereon without joining the 600 members, which would be cumbersome [8]. The Court distinguished this from actions merely to collect wages for work rendered, where employees are the real parties in interest; here, the wages accrue mainly on the strength of the agreement secured by the Union [9].

The orders appealed from are set aside, and the case is remanded to the court *a quo* for further proceedings [10].
