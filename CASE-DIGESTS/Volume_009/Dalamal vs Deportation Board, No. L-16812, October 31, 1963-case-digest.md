I. CAPTION
KISHU DALAMAL v. DEPORTATION BOARD, G.R. No. L-16812, October 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Kishu Dalamal, a British subject, was charged with violating Central Bank Rules and Regulations before the respondent Deportation Board [1]. Acting on the complaint, the Chairman of the Board issued a warrant of arrest against Dalamal pursuant to the authority granted by Section 1(b) of Executive Order No. 398 [1]. Dalamal was arrested on August 5, 1958, but was subsequently released upon filing a P10,000.00 bond [1]. He filed a petition for *habeas corpus* to annul the warrant and cancel his bond, arguing that Executive Order No. 398 is unconstitutional because only judges can issue warrants, and that the power to arrest cannot be validly delegated to the Board [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Deportation Board has the authority to issue warrants of arrest against aliens pending deportation investigations.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that Executive Order No. 398, insofar as it authorizes the Deportation Board to issue warrants of arrest, is null and void [3]. Section 69 of the Revised Administrative Code is the governing law for deportation proceedings and it does not authorize the President, directly or indirectly, to issue warrants of arrest during the investigation [4, 5].

Furthermore, even assuming *arguendo* that the President has the power to order an arrest as an incident to his inherent power to deport or through delegation by the Legislature, this power involves the exercise of judgment and discretion [6]. Under the principle of *delegata potestas non potest delegare* (delegated power cannot be further delegated), such discretionary power cannot be delegated to the Deportation Board [6, 7]. The Court relied on the doctrine in *Qua Chee Gan v. Deportation Board*, holding that while ministerial duties may be delegated, official functions requiring the exercise of discretion may not [7].

Petition granted; warrant of arrest set aside and bond cancelled [3].
