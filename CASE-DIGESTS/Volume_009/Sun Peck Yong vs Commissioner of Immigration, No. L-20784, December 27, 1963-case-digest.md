I. CAPTION
SUN PECK YONG, ET AL. v. THE COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION, G.R. No. L-20784, December 27, 1963, Barrera, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioners Sun Peck Yong and her minor children arrived in the Philippines in 1960 as temporary visitors [3]. Her husband, Cheng Ching, a permanent resident, obtained a favorable decision on his application for Philippine citizenship from the CFI in February 1961 [3]. Anticipating that the husband would take his oath of allegiance in February 1963, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Secretary of Justice administratively extended petitioners' stay until said date [4].

However, in January 1962, a new Secretary of Foreign Affairs declared the policy allowing such administrative extensions void [5]. Consequently, the Commissioner of Immigration ordered petitioners to leave the country within seven days as their original authorized stay had expired [5]. Petitioners filed a petition for prohibition to restrain the order. The trial court denied the petition, ruling that the extension was without authoritative basis and upholding the Commissioner's power to exclude them [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the favorable decision on the husband’s naturalization petition constitutes a valid basis for extending the wife's temporary stay.
2. W/N the naturalization of the husband automatically vests citizenship upon the wife.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the fact that a decision was favorably made on the naturalization petition of the husband is no assurance that he would eventually become a citizen. Therefore, such a decision cannot serve as a basis for the extension of the petitioner wife’s temporary stay [6, 7].

2. **NO.** The Court held that even if the husband becomes a naturalized citizen, this fact does not automatically make the wife a citizen of the Philippines. It must still be shown that she herself possesses all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications to become a citizen [7, 8].

**Decision affirmed.** [9]
