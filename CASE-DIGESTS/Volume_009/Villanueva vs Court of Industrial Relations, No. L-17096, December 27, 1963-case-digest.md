I. CAPTION
RODOLFO VILLANUEVA and/or PHILIPPINE EXPRESS AGENCY v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, JOSEPH GOTIANUY and/or ROYAL LINES, INC., CESAR DEL CASAL, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17096, December 27, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On December 20, 1955, Rodolfo Villanueva (charterer) and Joseph Gotianuy (owner) executed a Bareboat Charter Contract for the vessel M/V Regina [1]. The charterer hired a new set of officers and crew, including respondents Cesar del Casal et al., on January 18, 1956 [2]. The vessel sailed to Hong Kong but suffered engine trouble, leading to a judicial sale of the vessel in Hong Kong to settle debts, including partial payment of crew salaries [2, 3]. On October 8, 1958, the officers and crew filed a petition (Case No. 1110-V) with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) claiming P38,557.15 in unpaid wages and overtime pay for services rendered [4]. Petitioners argued that the CIR lacked jurisdiction over the claims [5]. The CIR ruled in favor of the crew, ordering Villanueva and Gotianuy to pay the unpaid salaries and overtime [5, 6]. Villanueva appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over claims exclusively for recovery of unpaid wages and overtime pay where the claimants are no longer in the service of the employer and do not seek reinstatement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the proceeding was exclusively for the recovery of unpaid wages and overtime pay [6]. Under settled law, the Court of Industrial Relations may take cognizance of such claims *only if*, at the time of the filing of the claim, the claimants were still in the service of the employer, or having been unlawfully or improperly separated from such service, should ask for reinstatement [6, 7]. Since the claimants were no longer in the service and sought no reinstatement, such claims should be brought before the regular courts [7]. The Court cited *Nassco vs. CIR* (G.R. No. L-13888) and *Pan American World Airways vs. Pan American Employees Association* (G.R. L-16275) in support of this doctrine [7].

Accordingly, the decision and resolution appealed from are **SET ASIDE**, without prejudice to the filing of the claims in the competent court.
