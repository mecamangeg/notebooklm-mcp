I. CAPTION
**GUARDIANSHIP OF THE INCOMPETENT MARCOSA RIVERA, REMEDIOS E. ESPIRITU v. ARMINIO RIVERA, OSCAR RIVERA, APOLINARIO RIVERA and DANILO RIVERA**, G.R. No. L-17092, September 30, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On March 2, 1953, Remedios E. Espiritu was appointed guardian of the estate of the incompetent Marcosa Rivera [1]. Marcosa died on September 11, 1957 [1]. On May 20, 1959, the appellants, who were the nearest relatives and heirs of the deceased, filed a motion for contempt against Espiritu for failing to render an accounting of the property [1]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal denied the motion but directed Espiritu to render an accounting [1].

On October 29, 1959, Espiritu filed her verified Final Report of Accounts [1]. The appellants filed a written opposition, alleging the report was incomplete as it failed to account for certain personal properties and fruits of the estate [1]. However, the opposition was not under oath and was couched in general terms [2]. Furthermore, on the date set for the hearing of the report, the appellants and their counsel failed to appear and substantiate their claims [1, 2]. Consequently, the lower court found the report "reasonable and in order" and approved it [1]. The appellants appealed, arguing the court erred in approving the report without receiving evidence despite their objection that it was incomplete [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court erred in approving the guardian's Final Report of Accounts despite the opposition claiming it was incomplete.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. The Court reasoned that the guardian's report was detailed and verified (supported by affidavit) [2]. In contrast, the opposition filed by the appellants was merely couched in general terms and was unverified [2]. Additionally, the appellants failed to appear on the scheduled hearing date to substantiate the claims made in their opposition [2]. Given these circumstances, the lower court committed no error in finding the Final Report of Accounts reasonable and approving the same [2].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [3].
