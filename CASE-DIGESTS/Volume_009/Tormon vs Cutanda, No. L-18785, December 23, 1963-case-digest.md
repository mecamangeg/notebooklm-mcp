I. CAPTION
ANDREA TORMON v. DOMINADOR CUTANDA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18785, December 23, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On October 7, 1949, petitioner Andrea Tormon borrowed PHP 350.00 from respondent spouses Dominador Cutanda and Leodegracia Sara, offering her land in Iloilo as security [1]. While the true agreement was a mortgage, the parties executed a document purporting to be a sale *a retro* (with right of repurchase) for seven years [1]. Tormon paid interest annually until 1959 [1]. In September 1960, Tormon offered to redeem the land, but the respondents instead consolidated their title on September 16, 1960, and obtained a new transfer certificate in their names [1, 2].

On November 8, 1960, Tormon filed a complaint for reformation of instrument [1]. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo dismissed the complaint, ruling that the action was barred by the statute of limitations [1, 3]. The lower court held that the ten-year prescriptive period under Article 1144 of the Civil Code began on the date of the deed's execution in 1949, and thus had elapsed by 1960 [3]. Tormon appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for reformation of the instrument has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal and remanded the case [5]. The Court ruled that under Article 1150 of the Civil Code, the prescriptive period counts from the day the action may be brought [4]. In an action to reform a fictitious or simulated deed of *pacto de retro* sale, the cause of action accrues only when the alleged vendees make known their intention, by overt acts, not to abide by the true agreement [6].

In this case, the prescriptive period did not begin at the execution of the contract in 1949, but rather when the respondents executed the affidavit of consolidation of title in September 1960 [6]. This consolidation was the act that repudiated the true mortgage agreement. Since the complaint was filed in November 1960—only two months after the cause of action arose—the action had not prescribed [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, and Regala concurred. Justice Makalintal took no part [5].
