I. CAPTION
PATROCINIO BUENTIPO v. COMMISSIONER, CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-19131, December 27, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Buentipo, a civil service eligible, was appointed Chief of Police of Pozorrubio, Pangasinan in 1956 but was suspended due to a criminal action. After the criminal case was dismissed, he sought reinstatement, but the Mayor refused. The Civil Service Commissioner (CSC) informed Buentipo that his eligibility had been cancelled because he was previously dismissed for cause (violation of regulations and gross misconduct) as a patrolman in Bangued, Abra in 1941. Buentipo filed an action for declaratory relief, denying the 1941 dismissal and arguing that the CSC had no record of the administrative charge. The CSC admitted that the original records of the administrative proceedings were destroyed during the war but presented index, examination, and service cards containing notations of the dismissal. The Court of First Instance ruled against Buentipo, admitting the cards as evidence. Buentipo appealed, questioning the admissibility of the cards.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Civil Service index and service cards are admissible as secondary evidence to prove the petitioner's dismissal for cause despite the loss of the original administrative records.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the index and service cards are admissible as secondary evidence. Since the original records of the administrative case were destroyed during the war, the contents of the decision may be proved by a recital of its contents in some authentic document under Section 41, Rule 123 of the Rules of Court. The cards are public records containing entries made by CSC officers in their official capacity and in the ordinary course of business. Therefore, the notations or gist of the decision contained in the cards are competent evidence of the fact of petitioner's dismissal.

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
