I. CAPTION
CLAUDIA MEJIA, FELICIANO MEJIA, NARCISA MEJIA, FELIPE MEJIA, JULITA MEJIA and ALFREDO MEJIA v. CASILDA M. DE MEJIA, G.R. No. L-18882, November 29, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants, alleging to be the voluntarily recognized illegitimate (adulterous) children of Teofilo Mejia, sued his widow, defendant-appellee Casilda M. de Mejia, for the partition of eight parcels of land and damages [1]. Teofilo Mejia died in 1942 [1]. The defendant denied the recognition and ownership of the lands [2]. The Court of First Instance of Ormoc City dismissed the complaint without a trial, ruling that under the Spanish Civil Code (which was in force in 1942), adulterous children were entitled to no more than support, and the successional rights granted by the New Civil Code could not be given retroactive effect [3]. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing they are entitled to successional rights under Article 2264 of the New Civil Code [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N adulterous children of a decedent who died in 1942 are entitled to the successional rights granted by the New Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that while Article 2264 of the New Civil Code grants successional rights to children born before its effectivity, this is subject to the qualification in Article 2253 that such new rights "does not prejudice or impair any vested or acquired right" [4]. When the decedent died in 1942, his heirs acquired vested rights to succeed him under the Spanish Civil Code then in force, which did not confer successional rights to adulterous children [4]. Consequently, the plaintiffs cannot avail of the new rights under the New Civil Code without impairing the vested rights of the heirs acquired in 1942 [4]. Rights to the inheritance of a person who died before the effectivity of the New Civil Code shall be governed by the Civil Code of 1889 (Spanish Civil Code) [5]. However, the Court also noted that the obligation to support adulterous children who were minors in 1942 was not extinguished by death but transmitted to the heirs [6, 7].

The Order of dismissal is REVERSED; record of the case remanded to lower court for further proceedings [8].
