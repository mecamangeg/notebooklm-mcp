**I. CAPTION**
ARSENIO VELUZ v. COURT OF APPEALS, JUDGE JESUS DE VEYRA, CITY SHERIFF OF MANILA, and THE REINSURANCE COMPANY OF THE ORIENT, INC., G.R. No. L-20585, September 30, 1963, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Arsenio Veluz (petitioner) was the defendant in an ejectment case filed by Reinsurance Company of the Orient, Inc. (respondent) regarding a leased premise. The case originated in the Municipal Court of Manila, was appealed to the Court of First Instance, and eventually reached the Court of Appeals [1]. Veluz filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court specifically to prevent his eviction from the property [1].

On July 16, 1963, the respondent corporation filed a manifestation informing the Court that Veluz had already vacated the premises in May 1963 without paying the rentals due for March through May 1963 [1]. Additionally, Veluz's appeal in the Court of Appeals was dismissed on July 9, 1963, because he failed to file his brief [1]. The Supreme Court ordered Veluz to comment on this manifestation, but he failed to file any response [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petition for certiorari to prevent eviction should be dismissed for being moot.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that the petition serves no further purpose. The sole objective of the certiorari petition was to prevent the petitioner's eviction [3]. Since the petitioner voluntarily vacated the premises to the satisfaction of the lessor pending the resolution of the petition, and his underlying appeal was dismissed for failure to file a brief, the legal issue has ceased to exist [2, 3].

Where a lessee vacates the premises pending the resolution of a petition to prevent eviction, the case becomes moot and academic [3, 4].

Accordingly, the case is **DISMISSED** [2].
