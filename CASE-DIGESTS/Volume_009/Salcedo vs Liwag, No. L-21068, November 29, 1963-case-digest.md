I. CAPTION
NARCISO D. SALCEDO v. HON. JUAN R. LIWAG, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21068, November 29, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Narciso D. Salcedo, the Second Assistant Provincial Fiscal of Sulu, investigated an incident involving Philippine Constabulary (PC) members and subsequently filed three informations for assault, physical injuries, and arbitrary detention against Lt. Romeo M. Reciña and others before the Justice of the Peace Court of Jolo [3]. Following the filing, the accused Reciña wrote to the Department of Justice requesting Salcedo's replacement, alleging "over enthusiasm and unusual interest" in the prosecution [4]. Consequently, respondent Secretary of Justice Juan R. Liwag and Chief Prosecutor Agapito Conchu issued multiple orders instructing Salcedo to turn over the cases to other fiscals [4, 5]. Salcedo refused to yield, arguing that he was not legally disqualified and that the orders constituted undue interference with his official duties [6]. He filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction to prevent the respondents from relieving him of the cases [2, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Secretary of Justice, under his power of control and supervision, can relieve a public prosecutor from handling a case he has investigated and filed in court, absent any legal disqualification. [7, 8]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that once a public prosecutor has been entrusted with the investigation of a case and has acted thereon by filing the necessary information in court, he is duty-bound by law to take charge of it until its final termination [9, 10]. A fiscal assumes full responsibility for the case and cannot be relieved therefrom except for grounds constituting legal disqualification [9].

The Court clarified that while Section 83 in relation to Section 79(C) of the Revised Administrative Code grants the Secretary of Justice "general supervision and control" over prosecutors, this power extends only to administrative matters [8]. It does not authorize the Secretary to conflict with or encroach upon the performance of a fiscal's duties in connection with specific cases he has investigated and acted upon [8, 11]. The Court found that the attempt to relieve Salcedo was motivated by political pressure and reasons incompatible with the sound administration of justice, rather than valid legal grounds [10].

The petition was **GRANTED**, and the respondents were enjoined from carrying out their orders relieving the petitioner [12].
