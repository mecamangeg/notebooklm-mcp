I. CAPTION
RUFINA BAUTISTA v. ATTY. BENJAMIN O. BARRIOS, Adm. Case No. 258, December 21, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In August 1955, Rufina Bautista engaged the services of respondent Atty. Benjamin Barrios to draft a deed of extra-judicial partition between the Bautista siblings and Federico Rovero involving the estate of Rovero's deceased wife. Atty. Barrios prepared the deed, which the parties signed. However, Rovero subsequently refused to comply with its terms. Rufina asked Atty. Barrios to represent her in a suit to enforce the deed, but he refused. Consequently, Rufina filed a complaint (Civil Case No. K-689) against Rovero through another counsel. Atty. Barrios then appeared as counsel for Rovero and opposed Rufina's demand, arguing that the deed did not contain all the terms of the agreement and was subject to modifications known to Rufina. Atty. Barrios claimed he was employed by both parties to draft the partition and thus could appear for Rovero [1], [2], [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Atty. Barrios is guilty of malpractice for representing conflicting interests.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that Atty. Barrios' conduct constitutes malpractice calling for corrective measures. Even assuming, as respondent claimed, that he was employed by both parties to draft the partition, it is doubtful whether he could appear for one against the other in subsequent litigation. At most, if he could appear for one client, it should be for the one who seeks to enforce the partition he drafted, rather than for the one seeking to avoid compliance with it. By appearing for Rovero, he took a position inconsistent with his previous work and violated the confidence of his former client by alleging undisclosed modifications to the deed [4], [5], [3].

Respondent Atty. Benjamin O. Barrios is suspended from the practice of his profession for a period of two years [6].
