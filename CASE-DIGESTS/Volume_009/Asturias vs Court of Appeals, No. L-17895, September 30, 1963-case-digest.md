I. CAPTION
FELIX ASTURIAS, ET AL. v. COURT OF APPEALS and NICOLAS MIRAS, G.R. No. L-17895, September 30, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On November 1, 1928, respondent Nicolas Miras obtained a loan of P500.00 at 3% interest per month from the spouses Laureano Asturias and Julia Orozco (petitioners' predecessors-in-interest), secured by a mortgage on his land. In 1930, the debt having reached P830.00 due to unpaid interest, Miras executed a document of sale with right of repurchase (*pacto de retro*) in favor of the spouses for said amount. The parties agreed that the spouses would gather coconuts from the land in lieu of the stipulated interest, while Miras remained in possession of the land to cultivate other crops.

After the spouses died, Miras offered to redeem the property from the petitioners (heirs), but they requested postponements. In 1946, petitioners attempted to enter the property, and in 1948, they fenced it to exclude Miras. Consequently, Miras filed an action to declare the contract a mortgage with usurious interest and for accounting. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Miras, declaring the contract void as a usurious mortgage. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision *in toto*. Petitioners appealed, arguing that Miras’ testimony was inadmissible under the survivorship disqualification rule and that the action had prescribed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the testimony of respondent Miras regarding the transaction with the deceased spouses is inadmissible under the survivorship disqualification rule.
2. W/N the action to declare the nullity of the usurious contract has prescribed.
3. W/N petitioners acquired the land through acquisitive prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petitioners are deemed to have waived the benefit and protection of the survivorship disqualification rule. The Court found that no timely objection was made against the admission of Miras' testimony during the trial. Furthermore, one of the petitioners, Felix Asturias, was made to testify on the same prohibited matters covered by the exclusion rule [1].

2. **NO.** A contract designed to hide a usurious agreement violates the law and public policy, making it illegal and void from its inception [2]. Under Article 1410 of the New Civil Code, the action or defense for the declaration of the inexistence of a void contract does not prescribe [2, 3]. The principle that "mere lapse of time cannot give efficacy to contracts that are null and void" applies to this case [3].

3. **NO.** Petitioners did not acquire title by prescription because their possession in the concept of an owner only began in 1946 when they attempted to exclude Miras, and the complaint was filed in 1948 [4]. Their gathering of coconuts since 1930 was merely for the payment of usurious interest and was done by the tolerance of the owner, which cannot be the basis for a claim of ownership by prescription [4].

WHEREFORE, the decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby affirmed, with costs against petitioners.
