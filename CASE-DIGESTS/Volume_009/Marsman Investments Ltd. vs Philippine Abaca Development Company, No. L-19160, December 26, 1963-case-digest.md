I. CAPTION
MARSMAN INVESTMENTS LTD., ET AL. v. PHILIPPINE ABACA DEVELOPMENT CO., ET AL., G.R. No. L-19160, December 26, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On March 23, 1961, Marsman Investments Ltd. filed a suit in the Court of First Instance of Davao on its own behalf and as a stockholder's derivative suit for Marsman & Co., against Philippine Abaca Development Co. (PADCO) and its controlling stockholder, Mary A. Marsman [1]. Plaintiffs alleged that PADCO, which ended its corporate existence in 1959, owed them substantial debts [1]. They claimed that PADCO fraudulently mortgaged and subsequently sold a tract of land to Mary A. Marsman between 1958 and 1959 to place it beyond the reach of creditors [2].

The lower court dismissed the complaint, ruling that: (1) there was a misjoinder of causes of action due to different venues; (2) the plaintiffs lacked capacity to sue because they had released/waived their claims against PADCO in 1959; and (3) Marsman & Co. had repudiated the derivative suit [3]. Plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the causes of action for collection of sum of money and rescission were properly joined.
2. W/N the repudiation of the derivative suit by the corporation (Marsman & Co.) was effective.
3. W/N the plaintiffs have a cause of action for rescission.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the two causes of action could be combined to lay a proper basis for an action for rescission [4]. Since the plaintiffs were not parties to the fraudulent transactions, they could only assail them by showing their credits were prejudiced; thus, establishing the indebtedness was necessary to establish their personality to sue for rescission under Arts. 1381(3) and 1382 of the Civil Code [4].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the repudiation of the suit by Marsman & Co. could not be given effect because the complaint alleged that defendant Mary A. Marsman was in absolute control of said corporation [5]. If a majority of shareholders under the control of the defendant were allowed to repudiate a derivative suit, no such action by minority stockholders would ever prosper [5].

3. **NO.** Despite the procedural victories above, the dismissal was proper because plaintiffs had executed a valid waiver and release of their credits against PADCO in 1959, two years before filing the suit [6]. Under the Civil Code, only **actual creditors** can ask for the rescission of conveyances made by debtors to strangers [6]. Having released their credits, plaintiffs ceased to be creditors and lost any legal basis or interest to assail the validity of the transfer [6].

The order of dismissal is affirmed [7].
