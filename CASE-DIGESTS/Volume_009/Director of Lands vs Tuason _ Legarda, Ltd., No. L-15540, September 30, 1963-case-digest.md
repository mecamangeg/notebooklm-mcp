I. CAPTION
THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS v. TUASON & LEGARDA, LTD., MUNICIPALITY OF LUBAO, PAMPANGA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15540, September 30, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On August 8, 1936, the Director of Lands filed a petition for compulsory registration of a tract of land in Lubao, Pampanga [2]. Tuason & Legarda, Ltd. claimed the land, while the Director of Lands, the Municipality of Lubao, and the Insular Government filed oppositions [3]. On July 8, 1958, the Court of First Instance of Pampanga rendered a decision confirming Tuason & Legarda, Ltd.'s title to several lots, holding that the Becuran, Malagulu, Bubula, and Mapanikit Creeks belonged to the corporation rather than the government entities [3]. The Municipality of Lubao, the Insular Government, and other claimants (Nicolas Bansil, et al.) appealed directly to the Supreme Court, alleging errors in the adjudication of the specific lots [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the appeal. [4, 5]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the case falls within the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals [4]. The Court reasoned that the appeal raised factual issues and the value of the lots covered by the respective appeals did not reach the amount of P200,000.00 [5]. Under the applicable rules, where the appeal raises factual issues and the value of the properties involved is less than P200,000.00, the case must be heard by the Court of Appeals [4].

The case was certified to the Court of Appeals for adjudication [1, 5].
