I. CAPTION
FILIPINO PIPE & FOUNDRY CORPORATION v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, JOSE A. NALDO, WENCESLAO GOZON and GUILLERMO HIWATIG, G.R. No. L-20381, December 24, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Filipino Pipe & Foundry Corporation employed respondent Guillermo Hiwatig. On May 3, 1961, Hiwatig suffered an accident on petitioner's premises and notified the company physician. On October 11, 1961, Hiwatig filed a claim for compensation with Regional Office No. 4 of the Department of Labor. Petitioner failed to file an answer to the claim within the statutory ten-day period. Consequently, on February 5, 1962, the Regional Commissioner declared the claim uncontroverted and issued an award granting Hiwatig compensation. Petitioner received a copy of the award on February 16, 1962.

On March 5, 1962, petitioner filed a "petition for new hearing," alleging that its failure to answer was due to the negligence of the president's secretary, who failed to deliver the copy of the claim to the president until January 1962. This petition was denied. Petitioner subsequently filed a "petition for relief from judgment," which was also denied. Petitioner then filed the present petition for certiorari, claiming the award was made without notice and hearing, thereby denying it due process.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is entitled to have the award annulled on the ground of denial of due process despite its failure to controvert the claim on time.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court denied the petition for lack of merit based on the following grounds:

1.  **Waiver of Right to Controvert:** Under Section 45 of Act No. 3428, an employer who fails to file an answer within ten days from notice of the claim is deemed to have renounced the right to controvert said claim. The claim is deemed admitted, and the employer has no right to demand a day in court.
2.  **Negligence of Employee:** The presumption favoring compensation is not affected by the petitioner's internal mishaps. The fact that the president's secretary failed to deliver the claim on time is not a valid excuse; the petitioner must suffer the effects of the omission or negligence of its own employees.
3.  **Finality of Award:** Under Section 50 of Act No. 3428, a Workmen’s Compensation Commission award becomes final and executory after fifteen days from notice. Petitioner received notice on February 16, 1962, but only filed for a new hearing on March 5, 1962—more than 15 days later. Thus, the award was already final.
4.  **Procedural Defects:** The "petition for new hearing," treated as a motion for relief from judgment, was fatally defective for lacking an affidavit of merit as required by Rule 38, Section 3 of the Rules of Court. Furthermore, the subsequent petition for relief was filed beyond the sixty-day period allowed from notice of the award.
5.  **Availability of Appeal:** Petitioner had a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law (appeal), rendering certiorari improper.

Petition denied; case dismissed.
