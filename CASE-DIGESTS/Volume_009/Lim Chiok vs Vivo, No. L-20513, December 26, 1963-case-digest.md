I. CAPTION
LIM CHIOK, CHEUNG BO CHOI alias Tiu SHU BEE, ET AL. v. HON. MARTINIANO VIVO, in his capacity as Commissioner of Immigration, G.R. No. L-20513, December 26, 1963, Barrera, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioners are aliens whose husband and father's petition for naturalization was granted by the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila on January 23, 1961 [2]. Anticipating that he would take his oath of allegiance by January 1963, petitioners obtained a change of status from temporary visitors to special non-immigrants from the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and Justice [2]. However, this extension was later declared a nullity by a new Secretary of Foreign Affairs [2]. On June 25, 1962, petitioners requested the respondent Commissioner of Immigration to extend their stay until January 23, 1963, but the request was denied, and they were ordered to leave the country within seven days [3]. Petitioners filed a petition for prohibition in the CFI of Manila to stop the order, but the trial court denied the petition [3]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Secretaries had the authority to change their status and extend their stay [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and Justice have the authority to change the status of aliens from temporary visitors to special non-immigrants and extend their stay. [4, 5]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the administration and enforcement of immigration laws lie with the Bureau of Immigration, and the Cabinet Resolution relied upon by petitioners did not specifically authorize the Secretaries to extend the stay of temporary visitors [6]. Under the express provisions of the Immigration Law, it is the Commissioner of Immigration who is vested with the power to grant extensions of stay, and the Cabinet has no power to amend or modify this law [5, 7]. Furthermore, under Section 9 of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, as amended, and established jurisprudence (e.g., *Ong Se Lim v. Board of Commissioners*), temporary visitors cannot have their status changed to special non-immigrants without first departing from the country [8]. Consequently, the Secretaries acted without authority.

The decision appealed from is affirmed [9].
