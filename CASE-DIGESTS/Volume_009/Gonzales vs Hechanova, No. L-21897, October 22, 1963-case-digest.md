I. CAPTION
RAMON A. GONZALES v. RUFINO G. HECHANOVA, et al., G.R. No. L-21897, October 22, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On September 22, 1963, Executive Secretary Rufino Hechanova authorized the importation of 67,000 tons of foreign rice from Vietnam and Burma. Petitioner Ramon A. Gonzales, a rice planter and president of the Iloilo Palay and Corn Planters Association, filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction. He argued that the importation violated Republic Act Nos. 2207 and 3452, which prohibit the Rice and Corn Administration or "any other government agency" from importing rice and corn. Respondents claimed the importation was validly authorized by the President as Commander-in-Chief for military stockpiling under the National Defense Act (Commonwealth Act No. 1) due to alleged threats in Southeast Asia. They argued that the "Government itself" is not covered by the prohibition on "government agencies," that the petitioner lacked standing, and that the contracts with foreign governments constituted valid executive agreements.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has legal standing to file the suit.
2. W/N the principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies bars the petition.
3. W/N the Executive Secretary or the Government itself has the authority to import rice despite the prohibitions in R.A. Nos. 2207 and 3452.
4. W/N the executive agreements with Vietnam and Burma validate the importation despite the statutory prohibition.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The petitioner has sufficient interest as a planter with substantial rice land (275 hectares), entitling him to sell to the Government under the policy of R.A. 3452, which mandates direct purchase from local planters [1]. He also possesses standing as a taxpayer because the unlawful importation utilizes public funds [1].

2. **NO.** The principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply when the question is purely legal, the act is patently illegal, the respondent is a department secretary acting as an alter ego of the President, or there is urgency [2][3]. The case falls under all these exceptions [3].

3. **NO.** The prohibition in R.A. Nos. 2207 and 3452 against importation by "any government agency" applies to the Government itself, as every officer is an agent of the Government [4]. The National Defense Act does not authorize the President to disregard these laws; stockpiling for national emergency is specifically governed by R.A. 3452, which requires such stocks to be accumulated from local sources unless an emergency is declared by the proper authority [5]. The Court rejected the theory that the Executive can disregard statutes if it believes compliance will not benefit the people, affirming that the country lives under a rule of law [6].

4. **NO.** While the President may enter into executive agreements, he cannot enter into a transaction prohibited by prior statutes [7]. The Executive's function is to enforce laws, not defeat them by indirectly repealing them through agreements [7]. The Constitution authorizes the Supreme Court to invalidate international agreements that run counter to an act of Congress [8].

Judgment was rendered declaring the Executive Secretary had no power to authorize the importation and that said importation was contrary to law; however, the writ of preliminary injunction was denied for lack of a requisite majority [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Bautista Angelo, J. (Concurring):** Agreed that the importation was illegal but concurred in denying the injunction to avoid the international embarrassment ("loss of face") of repudiating duly formalized government-to-government contracts [10]. He emphasized that civil authority must always remain supreme over the military [11].

**Barrera, J. (Concurring):** Concurred with the illegality of the act, warning against the "dangerous trend" of equating the Army with the Government to bypass laws [12]. He rejected the government's implied theory that "the end justifies the means" [13].
