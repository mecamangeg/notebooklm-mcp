I. CAPTION
CARLOS AVENDAÑO v. HON. LADISLAO PASICOLAN, LORETO SALONGA and ABELARDO SALONGA, G.R. No. L-18860, November 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Carlos Avendaño was the defendant in an unlawful detainer case filed by Tomasa Salonga (succeeded by respondents Loreto and Abelardo Salonga). The Justice of the Peace of Lubao, Pampanga ordered Avendaño to vacate the premises and pay a rental of P2,000.00 *per annum*. Avendaño appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pampanga and deposited the yearly rental with the Clerk of Court to stay execution. Respondents subsequently filed a motion for immediate execution, alleging that Avendaño failed to deposit the rental for the agricultural year 1960-1961 within the first ten (10) days of March 1961, as supposedly required by Section 8, Rule 72 of the Rules of Court. The respondent Judge Pasicolan granted the motion, ruling that the deposit made on March 29, 1961, was a violation of the rule. Avendaño filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that Rule 72 applies only to monthly rentals. During the pendency of the petition, the CFI rendered a final judgment on the merits ordering Avendaño's ejectment, and a writ of execution was issued.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Section 8, Rule 72 of the Rules of Court regarding immediate execution for failure to deposit rentals applies to fishponds rented on a yearly basis.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that Section 8, Rule 72 of the Rules of Court finds no application to execution of judgments in unlawful detainer cases involving fishponds rented on a yearly basis [1, 2]. The Rule contemplates the payment of a *monthly* rental, the failure of which gives rise to immediate execution, and not the payment of rental in any other manner [3]. The Court took judicial notice that fishponds are operated on a yearly basis as harvest accrues only once a year; thus, the rental fixed was *per annum* [3]. Citing *De la Cruz v. Dollete*, the Court ruled that the requirement to deposit within the first ten days of the month is inapplicable and the lower court erred in ordering execution [1, 4].

However, the petition was **DISMISSED**. The Court found that the issue had become moot and academic because the lower court had subsequently rendered a final judgment on the merits ordering ejectment, and a writ of execution had already been issued based on that final judgment, rendering the relief sought in the certiorari petition useless to the petitioner [5, 6].
