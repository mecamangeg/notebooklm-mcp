I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AURELIA MAGBORANG alias ELIENG, G.R. No. L-16937, September 30, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On October 23, 1956, Honorata Badajos and her young daughter Erlinda died of arsenic poisoning after eating a lunch of rice and *pinakbet* [1, 2]. Rosa Bacud, a relative who cooked the meal and also fell ill but survived, testified that she saw the accused, Aurelia Magborang, lift the lid of the *pinakbet* pot and put a whitish substance inside while they were in the kitchen [1]. Another witness, Valeriana Baturi, claimed she saw the act while washing her feet in a bathroom adjoining the kitchen [2]. Magborang, a laundrywoman for the house owners (the Caronans), denied the accusation, stating she was washing clothes near the rice mill the whole time [3]. The defense presented evidence, corroborated by the house owner Mrs. Caronan, that there was no bathroom adjoining the kitchen from which Valeriana could have seen the alleged act [4]. The Court of First Instance of Cagayan convicted Magborang of double murder and frustrated murder based on circumstantial evidence [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the circumstantial evidence presented is sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court reversed the judgment and acquitted the accused. The conviction rested entirely on circumstantial evidence, and the Court held that in such cases, "the weakest link in the chain is at the same time the most vital" [6]. Here, the vital link was the assumption that the *pinakbet* was the agency that carried the poison. However, there was no satisfactory proof of this because the leftover *pinakbet* was not subjected to chemical analysis [6]. The Court noted that the arsenic could conceivably have been mixed with the rice or present as insecticide on the vegetables before they were cooked [6]. Additionally, the credibility of the prosecution witness Valeriana was heavily compromised by the physical impossibility of her testimony regarding her location (the bathroom) and the contradiction by her employer [4]. The mere probability that the *pinakbet* was the culprit does not satisfy the test of moral certainty required in criminal cases [6].

**Disposition:** Judgment reversed and appellant is ACQUITTED [7].
