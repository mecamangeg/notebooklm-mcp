I. CAPTION
GO BON THE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16813, December 27, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Go Bon The, a Chinese citizen, filed a petition for naturalization. He claimed to be a merchant engaged in buying and selling hogs with an annual net income of P7,133.29 based on his 1958 income tax return [1]. His family consists of six members: himself, his wife, and four children [1, 2]. In his petition, he stated his residences were Espeleta and Comercio streets in Cebu City, and Camiguin Island during the Japanese occupation [3]. However, during trial, he testified that he had also resided in Tres de Abril and C. Padilla streets in Cebu City, which were not mentioned in his petition [3]. The Court of First Instance of Cebu ruled in his favor, and the Republic appealed [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the failure to state all former places of residence is fatal to the application.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that an annual net income of P7,133.29 is not lucrative for a family of six members [2, 6]. Based on this amount, the monthly per capita income is only P99.07, which is insufficient considering the high cost of living and low purchasing power of the peso [2]. Citing *Keng Giok v. Republic*, the Court held that such income cannot be considered substantial or lucrative for the support of the petitioner and his family [2, 3].

2. **YES.** The failure to state all former places of residence is a violation of Section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 and is a ground for the denial of the application [3, 7]. The omission of Tres de Abril and C. Padilla streets prevented the government from conducting appropriate inquiries regarding the petitioner's activities and character in those localities [8]. The petitioner's defense that the omitted streets were near his listed residence is untenable, as the requirement is mandatory to determine moral fitness [8, 9].

Decision REVERSED [4].
