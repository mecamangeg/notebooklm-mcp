I. CAPTION
**BACOLOD-MURCIA MILLING CO., INC. v. CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-12610, October 25, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On December 17, 1956, petitioner Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co., Inc. exported sugar to New York for $416,640.00. The Philippine Bank of Commerce, acting as the collecting bank, informed petitioner that under **Central Bank Circular No. 20**, specifically Section 4(a), all foreign exchange proceeds must be sold to the Central Bank at the prevailing official rate (P2.00 to $1.00) [1]. Petitioner objected, arguing that the circular was *ultra vires* and confiscatory, and demanded payment at the "real international worth" (market value) of the dollars, which was higher than the official rate [1].

Petitioner filed a special civil action for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to declare Circular No. 20 null and void and to enjoin its enforcement [2, 3]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that while petitioner suffered a loss, it was *damnum absque injuria* due to the state's sovereign power over currency [4]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is estopped from questioning the validity of Central Bank Circular No. 20.
2. W/N the Central Bank can be compelled to pay the market value of the dollar proceeds instead of the official par value.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the petitioner is barred by estoppel. Petitioner voluntarily obtained the license to export under the provisions of Circular No. 20. When it secured the license, it was fully aware that the license was issued subject to the requirement of surrendering the dollar proceeds to the Central Bank. Having availed itself of the license to export, the petitioner cannot subsequently question the right or power of the Bank to enforce the conditions of said license [5, 6].

2. **NO.** The Central Bank cannot be compelled to pay more than the par value of the peso. Under the **International Monetary Fund (IMF) Agreement**, the Philippines is obligated to maintain exchange stability and cannot unilaterally change the par value of the peso in relation to the dollar [7, 8]. Furthermore, under **Article 49 of Republic Act No. 265 (Central Bank Act)**, the Central Bank lacks the power to change the par value; such a change requires the President's action upon the Monetary Board's proposal and Congress's approval [9, 10]. To grant the petition would compel the Bank to violate these statutory and treaty obligations.

(Note: While the Ponente, Justice Labrador, personally opined that the power to "commandeer" foreign exchange was confiscatory and not authorized by the Central Bank Charter [11], the majority of the Court voted to dismiss the petition based on the grounds of estoppel and the legal impossibility of changing the par value [6, 12].)

**Petition dismissed.**
