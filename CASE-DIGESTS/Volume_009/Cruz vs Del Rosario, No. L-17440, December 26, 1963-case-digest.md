I. CAPTION
PERFECTA CRUZ v. ALIPIO DEL ROSARIO, LAND TENURE ADMINISTRATION, and JOSEFA DE LA PAZ, G.R. No. L-17440, December 26, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Perfecta Cruz and her daughter filed a claim for a lot in the Marikina Estate against Alipio del Rosario. After the Land Tenure Administration (LTA) was created, it assumed jurisdiction over the claim and rendered a decision adjudicating half of the property to Cruz's daughter and the other half to Del Rosario. Cruz moved for reconsideration twice, but both motions were denied. Instead of appealing the LTA decision to the Office of the President, Cruz filed an action with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon City to be declared the owner of the disputed portion. Del Rosario and intervenor Josefa de la Paz moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The CFI granted the motion and dismissed the case. Cruz appealed, arguing that LTA Administrative Order No. 1 does not strictly require an appeal to the President before seeking judicial intervention.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies was proper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the dismissal was correct. Sections 2 and 8 of Land Tenure Administration Administrative Order No. 1 explicitly provide that a decision of the LTA may be appealed to the Office of the President within 30 days, and failure to do so renders the decision final [1]. The Court emphasized that administrative rules and regulations have the force of law under Article 7 of the Civil Code [1].

The ruling reiterated the doctrine that when an adequate remedy is available within the Executive Department, a litigant must exhaust it before resorting to the courts. This principle is based on convenience and respect for a co-equal branch of government, allowing the administrative agency the opportunity to decide the matter correctly and preventing premature judicial interference [2]. Since Cruz failed to appeal to the President, she did not exhaust the available administrative remedies.

Appeal dismissed [3].
