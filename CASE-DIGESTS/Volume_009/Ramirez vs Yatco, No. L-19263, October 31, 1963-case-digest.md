I. CAPTION
TAHIMIK RAMIREZ v. HON. NICASIO YATCO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19263, October 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
An Oldsmobile car belonging to Bulkley, Dunton Paper (Far East) Co., Inc. (respondent corporation) disappeared, leading to the filing of an information for qualified theft against Edgardo Reyes, et al. in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon City [1]. The accused were convicted, though they appealed the decision [2]. During the proceedings, the car was seized via a search warrant issued by the Municipal Court of Manila from petitioner Tahimik Ramirez, who alleged he bought it in good faith from Bachrach Motor Company [2]. Respondent corporation filed a petition in the criminal case for the restitution of the car under Article 105 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) [2]. Ramirez opposed, claiming rights as a purchaser for value under Article 559 of the Civil Code and arguing that ownership should be litigated in a separate civil action [3]. The CFI (Judge Yatco) ordered the restitution of the car to the respondent corporation [3]. Ramirez filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may order the restitution of the stolen car to the offended party under Article 105 of the Revised Penal Code, even if the car is in the possession of a third person who acquired it by lawful means.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the order of the court *a quo* was correct pursuant to **Article 105 of the Revised Penal Code** [5]. This article expressly provides that "restitution of the thing itself shall be made by the court whenever possible, even though it be found in the possession of a third person who has acquired it by lawful means, saving only to the latter the action he may have against the proper person who may be liable to him" [5]. The only exception is when the thing has been acquired by the third person in a manner which bars action for its recovery (e.g., public sale), but there was no claim that the petitioner fell within such exception [5].

The Court further ruled that the custody of the car by the Municipal Court of Manila at the time of the order was "of no moment," as the car was the subject of the criminal case and the CFI retained jurisdiction over it [6].

Petition denied; the writ issued by the Court is dissolved [7].
