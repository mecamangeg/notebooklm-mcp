I. CAPTION
VISAYAN STEVEDORE-TRANSPORTATION CO. v. THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and EXALTACION BARRION, G.R. No. L-22135, December 27, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Graciano Gutana was a laborer employed by petitioner Visayan Stevedore-Transportation Co. to load sugar onto the Japanese ship "Hiyeharu Maru" at the Pulupandan wharf. On May 19, 1958, after working eight hours, Gutana and other laborers took a meal break on board the ship to prepare for overtime work. Due to inadequate sanitary facilities on the vessel, Gutana went down to a barge tied alongside the ship to relieve himself. While buttoning his pants, a raft bumped the barge, pinning him against the ship and causing his death. Petitioner voluntarily paid for the funeral expenses [1-3].

Gutana’s widow and children filed a claim for compensation on September 1, 1958, which petitioner controverted. The Regional Office of the Department of Labor awarded death compensation, which the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the claim was barred by prescription having been filed more than three months after the death, and that the death was caused by the employee's notorious negligence [3-5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claim for compensation is barred by prescription.
2. W/N the death was due to the employee's notorious negligence.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the claim was not barred despite being filed late. Under Section 24 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act (Act No. 3428), the requirement of filing a claim within the statutory period is dispensed with if the employer has voluntarily made compensation payments. Section 8 of the same Act classifies burial expenses as part of the death benefits. Since the petitioner voluntarily paid for Gutana's funeral expenses, the delay in filing the claim was not fatal [4].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the facts do not support the defense of notorious negligence. The inadequate sanitary facilities on the ship compelled the laborer to use the barge, which, under the circumstances, is considered an extension of the working premises. Furthermore, since the laborers took their meal on board and were not free to leave before resuming work, the accident is deemed to have arisen out of or in the course of employment [5].

The petition is dismissed [6].
