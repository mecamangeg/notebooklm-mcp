I. CAPTION
IPEKDJIAN MERCHANDISING CO., INC. v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS and COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-15430, September 30, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In 1951, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed Ipekdjian Merchandising Co., Inc. (Ipekdjian) P97,502.25 for compensating tax and surcharges on imported gold chains. Ipekdjian appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals (BTA), which affirmed the CIR’s decision (BTA Case No. 10) [1, 2]. Ipekdjian appealed to the Supreme Court, but the case was dismissed without prejudice because the BTA was deemed an administrative body without judicial power [2].

Subsequently, Ipekdjian filed a petition for review with the newly created Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) in 1955 (CTA Case No. 107), but it was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction as it was filed beyond the 30-day period prescribed by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 1125 [2]. Ipekdjian later made a partial payment of P5,000.00 and filed a claim for refund and cancellation of the balance, which the CIR denied on the ground that the BTA decision was already final [3]. Ipekdjian filed a new petition with the CTA (CTA Case No. 374). The CIR moved to dismiss on the ground of *res judicata*, which the CTA granted [3, 4]. Ipekdjian appealed, arguing that *res judicata* applies only to judgments by courts, not administrative bodies like the BTA [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals (BTA Case No. 10) operates as *res judicata* to bar the petition for refund.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that all requisites for *res judicata* were present: (1) the former judgment was final; (2) it was rendered by a body having jurisdiction; (3) it was a judgment on the merits; and (4) there was identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action [6, 7].

Although the BTA was originally an administrative body, R.A. No. 1125 conferred judicial character upon its decisions. Decisions of the BTA that were not appealed to the Court of First Instance or the CTA within 30 days of the CTA's creation received "judicial confirmation" and assumed the character of decisions of regular courts [8, 9]. Thus, the BTA decision became final and executory.

Furthermore, there is identity of cause of action. In both the BTA case challenging the assessment and the CTA case claiming a refund, the issue is Ipekdjian's claim of non-liability for compensating taxes [10]. A party cannot escape *res judicata* by merely changing the form of the action from an appeal of an assessment to a claim for refund [11].

The Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals is **AFFIRMED** [7].
