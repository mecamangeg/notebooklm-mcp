I. CAPTION
JESUS JIMENEZ, SR. v. MARGARITO LOFRANCO, G.R. No. L-21124, November 8, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Jesus Jimenez, Sr. and Margarito Lofranco contested the office of Mayor of Inabanga, Bohol. A related case involved Gregorio Aparece and Marino Pacaldo for Vice-Mayor. The Court of First Instance of Bohol declared Jimenez the duly elected Mayor with a plurality of 504 votes. Lofranco appealed, contesting the lower court's decision to invalidate numerous ballots as "marked." These ballots contained prefixes such as "Sr.", "Mr.", "Datu", "Don", "Ginoo", "Hon.", and "Dra." alongside candidate names [1-3]. The lower court rejected these ballots because: (a) only one candidate per ballot was given a prefix; and (b) the prefixes used for the same candidate within a precinct were of different natures and never repeated, suggesting a deliberate scheme to identify voters [4, 5]. Lofranco argued these were valid under the Revised Election Code and also sought to annul the entire returns of Precinct No. 5 due to isolated irregularities [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the ballots containing prefixes such as "Sr.", "Mr.", and "Don" were correctly invalidated as marked ballots.
2. W/N the returns of Precinct No. 5 should be annulled due to ballots written by two hands or one hand.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While Section 149, paragraph 5 of the Revised Election Code provides that ballots containing prefixes are valid, this rule applies only when such prefixes are not used as identification marks [6, 8]. The Court affirmed the lower court's finding that a "pattern or system" was devised to identify votes. The Court observed that in the invalidated ballots, only one candidate received a prefix, and in single precincts, a specific candidate (e.g., Lofranco) received up to 30 different, unrepeated prefixes [5]. This pattern proved the prefixes were not mere signs of respect but distinct marks to identify the electors [9, 10].

2. **NO.** The discovery of a few ballots written by two hands or several ballots written by one hand is insufficient to justify the annulment of the balloting for an entire precinct [7]. Furthermore, Precinct No. 5 contained only 132 votes; even if the entire precinct were annulled, it would not overcome the protestants' plurality of 504 votes [7].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [11].
