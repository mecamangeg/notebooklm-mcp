I. CAPTION
ALFREDO V. DE OCAMPO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19533, October 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On June 29, 1960, Alfredo V. de Ocampo filed an application for the registration of two parcels of land [1]. The trial court initially issued an order on May 13, 1961, declaring the Bureau of Public Schools as having waived its claim to the property due to its failure to file an answer [2]. Subsequently, on September 7, 1961, the Solicitor General filed an opposition on behalf of the Republic, claiming the lands belonged to the government by virtue of a legacy [3]. De Ocampo moved to dismiss this opposition. On December 18, 1961, the trial court denied De Ocampo’s motion, *motu proprio* set aside its previous May 13 order barring the government's answer, and admitted the Solicitor General's opposition [3, 4]. De Ocampo appealed this December 18 order. The Solicitor General opposed the appeal, arguing that the order was merely interlocutory and thus not appealable [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court's order setting aside its previous order of default and admitting the government's opposition is a final, appealable order.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the order is merely interlocutory and unappealable. The test to ascertain whether an order is interlocutory or final is whether it leaves something to be done in the trial court with respect to the merits of the case; if it does, it is interlocutory [5, 6]. A final order is one that disposes of the pending action so that nothing more can be done with it in the lower court [6].

In this case, the order merely set aside a previous default order and admitted the answer of the government, setting the case for hearing [7]. Since the main case regarding the land registration remained pending and the point regarding the admission of the answer could still be raised after a decision on the merits, the order did not put an end to the litigation [7, 8]. Consequently, the appeal was without merit.

The order appealed from is affirmed [9].
