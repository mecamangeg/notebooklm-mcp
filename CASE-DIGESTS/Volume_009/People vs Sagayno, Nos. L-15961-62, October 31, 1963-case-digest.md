I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SALVADOR SAGAYNO, LEONCIO SAGAYNO, INCIONG MENDEZ and PRIMO TABANAO, G.R. Nos. L-15961-62, October 31, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Due to a rivalry over women, the relationship between the group of Salvador Sagayno (including Leoncio Sagayno, Inciong Mendez, and Primo Tabanao) and the group of Jesus Dionaldo and Tranquilino Megalbin became strained. On the night of December 22, 1956, during a prayer gathering for a deceased child in Davao, Dionaldo and Megalbin went to the yard to urinate. They heard a shout of “horas na” (the time has come), after which the four accused attacked them. Megalbin was clubbed and stabbed, resulting in his death from a stab wound to the heart. Dionaldo sustained multiple stab wounds but survived.

The Court of First Instance convicted all four accused of Frustrated Homicide and Murder. They appealed to the Court of Appeals, which forwarded the case to the Supreme Court due to the penalty of life imprisonment. During the appeal, Salvador Sagayno withdrew his appeal. The remaining appellants (Leoncio, Mendez, and Tabanao) claimed non-participation, arguing that Salvador alone inflicted the injuries in self-defense.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellants participated in the crimes despite the claim that Salvador Sagayno acted alone.
2. W/N the crimes committed were qualified by treachery or evident premeditation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the defense of non-participation and the claim that Salvador acted alone were negated by the physical evidence. The autopsy findings revealed that the victims sustained contusions, swellings, and various stab wounds caused by different bladed and blunt instruments. The position and nature of these wounds indicated they could not have been inflicted by one person only [1-3]. Furthermore, the positive identification by the surviving victim and witnesses prevailed over the appellants' alibis [3].

2. **NO.** The Court held that treachery was not present because the attack was preceded by an incicident between the parties shortly before, and a shout of “horas na” warned the victims before the assault. Additionally, the fatal wound was frontal, and the victim admitted to a companion that he fought the appellants, proving he was facing them [4-6]. Evident premeditation was also ruled out because the fatal assault followed closely the previous incident at an artesian well, leaving insufficient time for cold reflection [6-8]. Abuse of superior strength was not considered as it was not alleged in the information [9].

Consequently, the crimes were downgraded. The appellants were convicted of **Homicide** (for the killing of Megalbin) and **Frustrated Homicide** (for the wounding of Dionaldo), and their penalties were modified under the Indeterminate Sentence Law [9, 10].
