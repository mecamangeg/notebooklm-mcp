**I. CAPTION**
MAXIMO FERRAREN v. RAMON B. AÑONUEVO, G.R. No. L-19275, November 29, 1963, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
In the November 10, 1959 general elections for Mayor of San Teodoro, Oriental Mindoro, the Municipal Board of Canvassers proclaimed Maximo Ferraren as the winner with 724 votes, a one-vote margin over Ramon Añonuevo's 723 votes. Añonuevo filed an election protest in the Court of First Instance (CFI) regarding Precinct No. 5, while Ferraren filed a counter-protest for Precincts Nos. 1-A, 3, 3-A, and 6. The CFI ruled in favor of Añonuevo, declaring him the duly elected mayor. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the decision, finding Añonuevo received 718 votes against Ferraren's 697. Ferraren appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the appreciation of specific ballots which were either invalidated as "marked" or claimed under the *idem sonans* rule.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the contested ballots containing specific expressions, nicknames, or repeated names should be invalidated as marked ballots or counted as valid votes.

**IV. RULING**
**YES** (as to some ballots) and **NO** (as to others). The Supreme Court affirmed the election of Añonuevo with modification to the vote count.

The Court applied the rule that expressions or remarks written opposite candidates' spaces are invalid marked ballots if written for the purpose of identification, often supported by evidence *aliunde*. Consequently, the Court held the following as **marked and invalid**:
1.  Ballots with irrelevant phrases like "Nako si Kristo," "Agdan Pook," "Tres Lease," and "A.P.O." (*Cruz v. Court of Appeals*).
2.  Ballots with "Marcos Maligalig" and "Joe" (written on the space for senator) were deemed identifiers.
3.  Ballots containing names of non-candidates like "D. Florida" (*Fausto v. de Guzman*) or "V. Rayos" written on five successive spaces (*Gutierrez v. Aquino*).
4.  Ballots with "Pira," "Epolod," "vote," and symbols like ".p." and "p.2.".

However, the Court ruled that certain expressions were **not identifying marks** but merely stray votes, thus valid for the candidate voted for. These included "Madalang," "Saiyo Lamang," "Sa Pepe Kit," and "Ponsing." The Court also applied the **idem sonans** rule, validating votes like "R. Ano," "A Aneabo," and "Añonuivo" for Añonuevo (*Lucero v. De Guzman*), and "Menarin" for Ferraren.

After re-appreciating the ballots, the Court deducted 7 votes from Añonuevo (Total: 711) and added 11 votes to Ferraren (Total: 708). Respondent Añonuevo was declared the elected Mayor with a plurality of three votes.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
**J.B.L. Reyes, J. (Concurring and Dissenting):** Concurred with the majority but dissented regarding Exhibits 31 ("Pira"), 34 ("Epolod"), and 44 (initials). He argued these were not marked ballots in the absence of evidence *aliunde* and should be counted for Ferraren, which would have resulted in a tie (711-711). Justice Padilla concurred with this opinion.
