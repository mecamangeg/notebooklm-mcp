I. CAPTION
VICTORIAS MILLING CO., INC. v. VICTORIAS-MANAPLA WORKERS ORGANIZATION - PAFLU, FREE VISAYAN WORKERS (FFW), ET AL., G.R. No. L-18467 and L-18470, September 30, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Victorias Milling Company (Petitioner) and Free Visayan Workers (FFW) entered into a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) expiring on December 31, 1959. The CBA contained an automatic renewal clause and a "closed-shop" provision, requiring employees to remain members of FFW in good standing as a condition of continued employment. Ten employees, who were FFW members, resigned from FFW and joined the respondent union, Victorias-Manapla Workers Organization-PAFLU, on February 10, 1960. This occurred after the CBA had automatically renewed because no notice to terminate was sent within the stipulated period. Consequently, FFW investigated and recommended the dismissal of these employees pursuant to the closed-shop provision. The Company dismissed them. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled the dismissal was an unfair labor practice, holding that the closed-shop provision should not perpetuate the union and suspended the automatic renewal to allow for a certification election.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of employees pursuant to a closed-shop provision in an automatically renewed CBA constitutes unfair labor practice.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The dismissal was valid and does not constitute unfair labor practice. The Supreme Court held that the closed-shop agreement was valid and binding under Philippine laws. The contract had automatically renewed and was in full force when the employees switched unions; thus, the Company was merely enforcing the terms of the existing CBA.

The Court emphasized that the freedom of employees to organize and select their representatives under the Industrial Peace Act "should be subordinated to the constitutional provision protecting the sanctity of contracts." An attempt to override the constitutional provision on the sanctity of obligations of contracts would be null and void. The Court cited *Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co. v. NLRB* (338 U.S. 355), noting that while closed-shop agreements limit the right to choose a union, they are valid to ensure union integrity and stability.

The decision of the lower court is SET ASIDE, the complaint for unfair labor practice is DISMISSED, and the appeal for back wages is DENIED.
