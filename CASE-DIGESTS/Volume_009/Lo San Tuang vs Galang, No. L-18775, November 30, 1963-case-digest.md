**I. CAPTION**
LO SAN TUANG v. EMILIO L. GALANG, as Commissioner of Immigration, G.R. No. L-18775, November 30, 1963, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Lo San Tuang, a citizen of Nationalist China, arrived in the Philippines on July 1, 1960, as a temporary visitor authorized to stay until June 30, 1961 [1]. Instead of departing, she requested the Commissioner of Immigration to cancel her alien certificate of registration, claiming she had acquired Philippine citizenship because her husband, Ngo Seng, was naturalized as a Filipino citizen on January 7, 1961 [1]. The Commissioner denied her request [2]. Petitioner filed for prohibition and mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, submitting a joint affidavit with her husband stating she was not disqualified from citizenship [2]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that under Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473), an alien woman must prove she has all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications for naturalization [2]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that based on American jurisprudence (*Leonard v. Grant*), she only needed to prove she was not of a disqualified class or race [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N an alien woman married to a Filipino citizen must prove she possesses all qualifications and none of the disqualifications for naturalization to acquire Philippine citizenship.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order, holding that under Section 15 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, an alien woman married to a Filipino citizen acquires his citizenship only if she "might herself be lawfully naturalized" [4, 5]. This statutory phrase requires the woman to prove not only that she is not disqualified (under Section 4) but also that she possesses **all the qualifications** required by Section 2 of the law [5, 6]. The Court distinguished the case from *Leonard v. Grant*, noting that since the Philippine law had eliminated racial or class considerations, the requirement "might herself be lawfully naturalized" must now be understood to refer to the specific statutory qualifications for citizenship [6, 7]. Since the petitioner offered no proof that she possessed all the required qualifications—her self-serving affidavit being insufficient—her marriage did not automatically confer Philippine citizenship upon her [5]. The order of the lower court was affirmed [8].
