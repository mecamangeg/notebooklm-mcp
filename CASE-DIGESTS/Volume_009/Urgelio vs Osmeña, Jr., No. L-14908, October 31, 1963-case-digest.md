I. CAPTION
SINFORIANO V. URGELIO, JOSE V. ENCABO, and JORGE M. VILLARIN v. SERGIO OSMEÑA, JR., ET AL., G.R. No. L-14908, October 31, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners-appellants Jose V. Encabo and Jorge Villarin were permanent employees (office helper and laborer, respectively) performing clerical duties in the Office of the City Mayor of Cebu. On January 5, 1956, the Municipal Board created 35 new positions in the Mayor's office. Shortly thereafter, on February 10, 1956, the Board passed Ordinance No. 192 abolishing several positions, including those held by the petitioners, ostensibly for "economy and efficiency." Mayor Sergio Osmeña, Jr. terminated their services effective March 15, 1956. Petitioners filed a petition for mandamus in the Court of First Instance of Cebu, alleging the abolition was in bad faith and in violation of the Civil Service Law. The lower court dismissed the petition.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the abolition of the petitioners' positions was valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that while the municipal board has the power to fix the number of officials and employees, the abolition of a position must be in good faith and not characterized by fraud or improper motives. It cannot be resorted to as a means to remove incumbents in violation of the Civil Service Law [1].

The Court found that the defense of "economy and efficiency" was a subterfuge, evidenced by the creation of 35 new positions shortly before the abolition, the creation of 16 additional positions afterward, and the granting of salary increases [2]. Furthermore, the duties performed by the petitioners continued to be performed by other employees after their separation [3]. Citing *Concepcion, Briones, et al. v. Osmeña, Jr.*, which involved the same ordinance, the Court declared the abolition a transparent device to unseat incumbents.

The judgment is reversed. The abolition is declared null and void, and the City of Cebu is ordered to reinstate the petitioners, pay their back wages, and pay attorney's fees [4].
