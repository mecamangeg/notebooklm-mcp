I. CAPTION
AMANDO M. DIZON v. DEMETRIO B. ENCARNACION, G.R. No. L-18615, December 24, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellant Amando M. Dizon, a resident of Pampanga, filed a complaint for damages in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pampanga against defendant-appellee Demetrio B. Encarnacion [1]. The suit stemmed from a "Manifestation and Refutation" filed by Encarnacion in Special Proceeding No. 2025 (Intestate Estate of the Deceased Agustin N. Medina) in the CFI of Zambales, which Dizon alleged was libelous and derogatory [1]. Encarnacion moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of improper venue, arguing that under Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by R.A. No. 1289), the action should have been filed in the CFI of Zambales where the document was filed/published [2]. The CFI of Pampanga granted the motion and dismissed the case [2]. Dizon appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the venue was improperly laid in the CFI of Pampanga because the alleged libel was published in Zambales.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The venue was properly laid in Pampanga. The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal order and remanded the case [3].

The Court held that Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code establishes a general rule that civil actions for damages in written defamation cases "shall" be filed in the CFI of the province or city where any of the accused or any of the offended parties resides [4]. The plaintiff is generally limited to these two choices. The proviso stating that where the libel is published in a province where neither party resides, the action "*may* be brought" in the court of that province, is merely permissive [4].

The use of the word "may" in the second sentence, contrasted with "shall" in the first, indicates that Congress intended to broaden the plaintiff's choices by offering a third venue option, rather than restricting it [4, 5]. This provision is for the benefit of the offended party and may be waived [5]. To interpret it as mandatory would allow defendants to harass plaintiffs by publishing libels in remote locations to make seeking redress difficult [6]. Since Dizon is a resident of Pampanga, the CFI of Pampanga is a proper venue [1, 4].
