I. CAPTION
SALVADOR L. CALO v. COURT OF APPEALS and CASIANO G. PLAZA, G.R. No. L-21256, September 30, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Salvador L. Calo and respondent Casiano G. Plaza were candidates for Mayor of Butuan City in the November 10, 1959 elections. The Board of Canvassers proclaimed Calo the winner with a plurality of 186 votes [1]. Plaza filed an election protest with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan, which declared Plaza the winner by 26 votes. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed Plaza's victory but reduced his plurality to five (5) votes [1].

The CA credited Plaza with ballots where "D.O. Plaza" or "Monting Plaza" was written in the space for Mayor, reasoning that although Democrito O. Plaza (nickname "Monting") was a candidate for Governor, the voters intended a person other than the gubernatorial candidate. This conclusion was reached even for ballots where "D.O. Plaza" was written in *both* the spaces for Mayor and Governor [2]. Calo appealed by certiorari, challenging the appreciation of these ballots and others [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N ballots where the name of a candidate for Governor ("D.O. Plaza") is written in the space for Mayor should be counted in favor of the mayoral candidate with the same surname (Casiano G. Plaza).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision.

The Court held that where the name written in the space for Mayor is "D.O. Plaza" or "Monting Plaza"—referring to Democrito O. Plaza, a candidate for Governor—these cannot be counted for Casiano G. Plaza. Specifically, where the same name ("D.O. Plaza") is written in *both* the spaces for Mayor and Governor, the conclusion that the voter had a different person in mind for Mayor is untenable. Having written the same name in both spaces, the voter must be deemed to have intended the *same individual*, since "identity of names necessarily connotes identity of persons," unless satisfactorily established otherwise [2, 3]. Consequently, these are stray votes for Mayor [2].

Furthermore, Paragraphs (1) and (6) of Section 149 of the Revised Election Code do not apply where the surname is accompanied by initials of another candidate ("D.O." or "D."), or where the initials and surname belong to another candidate, even if for a different office [4, 5].

The Court also ruled on various other ballots:
1.  **Stray Votes:** Ballots containing "D.O. Plaza," "D. Plaza," "D.O. Pleza," and "D.B. Plaza" for Mayor were deducted from Plaza [6-8].
2.  **Marked Ballots:** Ballots with pasted stickers, "Plaza" written in four Senatorial spaces, or derogatory remarks were declared marked and deducted from Plaza [8, 9].
3.  **Valid Ballots for Calo:** The Court reinstated ballots erroneously nullified by the lower court, such as those containing "S Kato" (idem sonans with Calo), "Vocales" (Spanish for members), "Conbaburd," "E. Chez" (block letters), and "D.O. Plaza ako" (indicating desire to vote for Governor, not a mark) [10-13].

After re-appreciating the ballots, Calo received a total of 7,415 votes against Plaza's 7,381. The decision of the Court of Appeals was **REVERSED**, and Salvador L. Calo was declared the duly elected Mayor of Butuan City [14].
