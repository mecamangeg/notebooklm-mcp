I. CAPTION
In the Matter of the Petition of Nicolas Loo Tee to be Admitted as Citizen of the Philippines: NICOLAS LOO TEE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18009, December 27, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Nicolas Loo Tee filed a petition for naturalization on July 17, 1959, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Batangas [1]. The Republic appealed the decision on two grounds: failure to prove irreproachable conduct and lack of a lucrative trade [1]. In October 1957, Loo Tee's bodega, insured for P150,000, was destroyed by fire; however, the insurance company paid him only P60,000 [2]. The following year, his store, insured for P25,000, was also burned [2]. A Constabulary agent testified that Loo Tee was evasive during the investigation and opined that the fires were intentional, although no criminal action was subsequently filed against him [2, 3]. Regarding his finances, Loo Tee's income tax returns showed a net income of P1,107.87 in 1957 and P2,693.96 in 1959, while his 1958 records were destroyed by the fire [4]. He has a wife and seven children, four of whom attend school [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner despite the lack of criminal charges regarding the fires.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the mere fact that no criminal action was taken against the petitioner in connection with the fires does not prove he conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner [3, 5]. Proper and irreproachable conduct in relations with the Government and the community is a statutory qualification the petitioner is bound to establish affirmatively, regardless of the outcome of police investigations [3].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that an annual net income of P1,107.87 and P2,693.96 is not sufficient to satisfy the lucrative income requirement [4, 6]. Considering the petitioner has a wife and seven children to support, with four attending school, it is "obvious" that he does not possess a lucrative trade or occupation [4]. The Court relied on jurisprudence such as *Tan v. Republic* and *Ngo v. Republic* to support this conclusion [4].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DISMISSED** [7].
