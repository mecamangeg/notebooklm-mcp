I. CAPTION
FELICIANO Z. TIMBANCAYA v. SEVERINO E. VICENTE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19100, December 27, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Feliciano Z. Timbancaya, the Chief of Police of Puerto Princesa, faced administrative charges filed by the Municipal Mayor for failure to arrest individuals who assaulted the Municipal Attorney and for delaying the filing of a homicide case. The Municipal Council investigated the charges under Republic Act No. 557, found him guilty, and required his resignation. This decision was affirmed by the Commissioner of Civil Service.

Timbancaya filed a petition for mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Palawan, alleging that the administrative decision was contrary to law and evidence, and that the hearing was partial. Over the objection of the Provincial Fiscal, the CFI conducted a trial *de novo*, receiving new testimony from Timbancaya and his witnesses. The CFI subsequently ruled that there was insufficient evidence to support the administrative charges and ordered his reinstatement [1-4]. The Fiscal appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the CFI had no power to review the merits of the administrative case or retry it *de novo* [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance may retry an administrative case *de novo* and admit new evidence to re-examine the sufficiency of the evidence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the lower court erred in inquiring into the sufficiency of the evidence based on new testimony presented in court. The invariable rule in reviewing administrative decisions of the Executive branch is that findings of fact must be respected as long as they are supported by substantial evidence, even if not overwhelming (*Ang Tibay v. C.I.R.*). It is not for the reviewing court to weigh conflicting evidence, determine credibility, or substitute its own judgment for that of the administrative agency (*Lao Tang Bun v. Fabre*).

Administrative decisions can only be set aside upon proof of gross abuse of discretion, fraud, or error of law (*Lovina v. Moreno*). Courts are not authorized to receive additional evidence not submitted to the administrative agency; the question of abuse of discretion must be resolved solely on the proof the administrative authorities had before them. The CFI should have limited its inquiry to the charges of error of law, partiality, and denial of due process against the decision of the Commissioner of Civil Service [5, 6].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and **SET ASIDE**, and the case is remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings [7].
