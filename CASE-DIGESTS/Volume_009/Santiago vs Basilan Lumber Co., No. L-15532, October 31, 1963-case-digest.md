I. CAPTION
LUIS I. SANTIAGO v. BASILAN LUMBER COMPANY, G.R. No. L-15532, October 31, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Luis I. Santiago owned a parcel of land in Maluso, Basilan City, covered by TCT No. T-190. In November 1952, defendant Basilan Lumber Company entered the property without Santiago's consent, destroyed a banca, and cut 66,000 board feet of timber. Santiago filed a complaint for damages.

Basilan Lumber Company admitted cutting the timber but argued it held a valid timber license. It claimed the land was not a "private woodland" because Santiago failed to register it with the Bureau of Forestry as required by Section 1829 of the Revised Administrative Code; thus, the timber remained government property. The parties stipulated that the land was indeed not registered as a private woodland. Santiago moved for judgment on the pleadings, to which the defendant did not object. The lower court ruled in favor of Santiago, awarding damages for the timber, the banca, and injury to the land based on the amounts alleged in the complaint.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure of a landowner to register their title with the Bureau of Forestry as a private woodland divests them of ownership rights over the timber found thereon.
2. W/N the court may award damages based solely on the pleadings without the presentation of evidence.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that non-compliance with Section 1829 of the Revised Administrative Code does not divest the owner of the land of his rights thereto. The land, titled under the Land Registration Act, cannot be the object of a forest license issued to another because ownership of land includes ownership of everything found on its surface under Article 437 of the New Civil Code. The owner also retains the right to exclude any person from the enjoyment and disposal thereof under Article 429 of the New Civil Code. The sole consequence of failing to register the title with the Director of Forestry is that the owner becomes liable for the forestry charges collectible on forest products gathered and removed, as provided by Section 266 of the National Internal Revenue Code [1-4].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that where the plaintiff moves to have the case decided on the pleadings and the defendant interposes no objection, the defendant is deemed to have admitted the allegations of fact in the complaint, including the amount of damages. Consequently, there was no necessity for the plaintiff to submit evidence, and the lower court correctly based its award on the allegations and prayer in the complaint [4, 5].

**The decision appealed from is affirmed.**
