I. CAPTION
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT CO. v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and GUILLERMA MILLANO, G.R. No. L-19854, December 27, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Guillerma Millano was employed as a spinner for petitioner National Development Company (NDC) starting in November 1947 [1]. Her work was strenuous, involving lifting heavy objects, night shifts, and exposure to excessive cotton dust and sudden temperature changes [2]. Although she was healthy when hired, she began suffering from chest pains and coughing in mid-1950, and was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis later that year [2]. On January 11, 1951, while working, two heavy roves fell on her back, causing her to feel dizzy and spit blood [1]. She filed a claim for compensation.

The hearing officer ruled in her favor, awarding P2,995.20 in compensation and P1,800 for medical expenses, finding her illness was caused and aggravated by her employment [3, 4]. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed the decision [3]. NDC appealed, arguing that the WCC erred by making findings on the "development" of the illness when the complaint allegedly only raised the issue of "aggravation" [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Commission erred in affirming the award based on the finding that the employment caused the "development" of the illness, given NDC's claim that only "aggravation" was pleaded.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court rejected NDC's contention. A review of the complaint showed that Millano did not rely solely on "aggravation" but explicitly alleged that her work conditions were conducive to the "**development** and aggravation of pulmonary tuberculosis" [2, 6]. The Court held that the allegations regarding the strenuous nature of her work and her prior good health were sufficient to support the conclusion that the illness was a result of the nature of her employment [6]. Therefore, the hearing officer and the Associate Commissioner did not exceed their authority in relying on *both* grounds—that the employment caused her to contract the disease in 1950 and that continued work aggravated it in 1951—to justify the award [4]. The findings were supported by substantial evidence [7].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [7].
