I. CAPTION
EUGENIO CHAVEZ v. THE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS and AQUILINO DE LOS REYES, G.R. No. L-17814, October 31, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Aquilino de los Reyes purchased a parcel of riceland in Batangas in 1957 from Troadio Frontera, intending to cultivate it himself [1]. The land was tenanted by Pablo Chavez, a septuagenarian, who was assisted by his son, petitioner Eugenio Chavez [1]. De los Reyes filed a petition to dispossess Pablo in 1957, but it was dismissed without prejudice [2]. Pablo died on October 21, 1958 [3].

On January 5, 1959, petitioner and Pablo’s widow signed an agreement with the landowner, accepting P500.00 as compensation for improvements and agreeing to vacate the land after harvesting the standing crop [3, 4]. Petitioner later attempted to return the money and filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) on April 8, 1959, seeking reinstatement as tenant [4, 5]. The CAR dismissed the petition, finding that petitioner was not a tenant but merely a helper, and that the tenancy relationship was terminated upon Pablo’s death under the law then in force [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the factual finding of the CAR that petitioner was not a tenant is reviewable by the Supreme Court.
2. W/N Republic Act No. 2263, which grants successional rights to a tenant's heirs, applies retroactively to a tenancy relationship terminated by death prior to its enactment.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A factual finding by the Court of Agrarian Relations, when supported by substantial evidence, may no longer be reviewed by the Supreme Court [6]. The evidence showed petitioner merely helped his father, who was the recognized tenant. Petitioner’s claim that he assumed tenancy in 1954 was belied by his father’s own pleadings in the previous ejectment case, where Pablo asserted he was still capable of working the land [6].

2. **NO.** The tenancy relationship was terminated upon Pablo's death on October 21, 1958, pursuant to Section 9 of Republic Act No. 1199, the law in force at that time [7, 8]. Republic Act No. 2263, which amended Section 9 to allow the tenancy to continue with a qualified member of the deceased tenant's immediate farm household, only took effect on June 19, 1959 [8, 9]. The Court held in *Ulpiendo v. CAR* that this amendment cannot be applied retroactively, as reviving an extinguished tenancy relationship would impair the landowner’s substantive vested rights [8]. Furthermore, Section 9 of RA 2263 provides an exception to the right of succession if the landholder intends to cultivate the land personally, which respondent De los Reyes had manifested and undertaken to do [10].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Regala, J., voted that the case should be sent to the Court of Appeals under the new law, Republic Act No. 3844 [11].
