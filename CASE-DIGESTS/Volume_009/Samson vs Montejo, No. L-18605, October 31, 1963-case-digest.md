I. CAPTION
SEVERINO SAMSON v. HON. GREGORIO D. MONTEJO AND GREGORIO DINGLASA, G.R. No. L-18605, October 31, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Dinglasa, the registered owner of a homestead, sold the land to Petitioner Samson in 1947 [1]. Dinglasa later filed an action for redemption, which resulted in a final judgment ordering Samson to resell the property and pay costs, but made no mention of fruits or income [2]. After the judgment became final and executory, and a writ of execution had already been issued, Dinglasa filed a Motion to Modify Writ of Execution in 1961 [3]. He alleged that Samson had possessed the land and enjoyed its fruits during the pendency of the proceedings. Respondent Judge Montejo granted the motion and amended the writ to include P3,000.00 representing the income of the property for five years [4]. Samson challenged this amendment, arguing the court could not alter a final judgment.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court can amend a writ of execution to include the value of fruits/income not awarded in the final and executory judgment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** Once a decision becomes final, even the court which rendered it cannot lawfully alter or modify the same, especially when the alteration is material and substantial [5]. The mission of the court is limited to the execution and enforcement of the final judgment in accordance with its express orders [6, 7]. The original decision did not award the value of fruits or income to Dinglasa. By amending the writ to include P3,000.00, the Judge greatly augmented Samson's liability without a proper proceeding where Samson could have presented valid defenses, such as production expenses or lack of harvest [5, 7].

The Order complained of is declared without force and effect, and the writ of certiorari is granted [7].
