I. CAPTION
NANIKRAN SERWANI (NANKI HIRANAND) v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18219, December 27, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Nanikran Serwani, a citizen of India born in Silay, Negros Occidental in 1936, resided continuously in the Philippines since birth [3]. He is married and works as a merchant [3]. On May 20, 1959, he filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [2]. He reported a net income of P1,746.71 for the year 1959 [3]. To support his petition, he presented two character witnesses who were members of the bar [4]. However, these witnesses testified that they had known the petitioner for only about ten years, and had no knowledge of his conduct prior to 1948 or 1949 [5, 6]. The Solicitor General opposed the petition, arguing insufficiency of evidence regarding petitioner's conduct, lack of lucrative income, and lack of witness credibility [2]. The CFI denied the petition, prompting this appeal [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner proved proper and irreproachable conduct during his entire residence in the Philippines.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
3. W/N the character witnesses were proven to be credible persons.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the testimony of the two witnesses was insufficient because they could not vouch for the petitioner's conduct during the *entire* period of his residence in the Philippines, which began at his birth [5]. Under Section 2, Paragraph 3 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, a petitioner must prove proper and irreproachable conduct during his entire residence, not just for the period required to file the petition [6]. The failure to prove such conduct for the entire residence is a fatal flaw [6].

2. **NO.** The petitioner's net income of P1,746.71 for 1959 is not considered lucrative, especially considering he has a wife to support and the high cost of living [7]. The Court held that financial capacity is determined by present earnings, not speculative future employment, citing *Swee Din Tan v. Republic* [7].

3. **NO.** The mere fact that the character witnesses are members of the bar does not automatically make them "credible" within the meaning of the naturalization law [4]. Citing *Ong v. Republic*, the Court emphasized that it must be proven by sufficient evidence that the witnesses have good standing in the community, are honest and upright, and are reputed to be trustworthy [4].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [8].
