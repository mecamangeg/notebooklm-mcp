I. CAPTION
**COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. WILLIAM LI YAO**, G.R. No. L-11861, December 27, 1963, Labrador, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
The Collector of Internal Revenue appealed a decision by the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) regarding the collection of deficiency income taxes from respondent William Li Yao [2]. The CTA found that Li Yao had an opening net worth of P159,910.89 as of January 1945, accepting Li Yao's testimony that this amount was held in trust by his father and gradually released to him [2]. The CTA relied on Li Yao's naturalization application claiming he was in business since 1940 and a BIR examiner's certificate (Exhibit A) alleging Li Yao earned substantial income between 1936 and 1940 [3]. Additionally, the CTA allowed a deduction of P5,470.98 from the final tax deficiency, representing deficiency income tax payments made by Li Yao in 1948 for the years 1945-1947 [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CTA erred in finding Li Yao had an opening net worth of P159,910.89 as of January 1945.
2. W/N the deduction of previous deficiency tax payments violated the rule on equitable recoupment.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The evidence supporting the claimed opening net worth was neither competent nor trustworthy [5]. Li Yao's naturalization application was self-serving and contradictory, as he claimed to start business in 1940 yet alleged income from 1936-1938 [6]. The BIR examiner's certificate was inadmissible and not the best evidence because the supporting working papers were not produced [7]. Furthermore, Li Yao was only 15 years old in 1936 when he supposedly earned over P105,000, which the Court found unbelievable; such income, if earned, likely belonged to his father [8, 9].

2. **NO.** The deduction was proper and did not violate the rule on equitable recoupment [4]. The payments were made during the investigation of tax deficiencies and were not independent, voluntary payments of taxes believed to be due [4]. Since these were not taxes "erroneously or illegally collected" but rather parts of taxes due and unpaid, Section 306 of the National Internal Revenue Code does not apply [4].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is MODIFIED. The finding of an opening net worth of P159,910.89 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and a new assessment is ordered eliminating said amount [10].
