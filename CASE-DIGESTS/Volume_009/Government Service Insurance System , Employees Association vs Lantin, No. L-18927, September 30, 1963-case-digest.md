**I. CAPTION**
GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION (CUGCO-KMP), ET AL. v. HON. GREGORIO T. LANTIN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18927, September 30, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
On August 17, 1961, a labor dispute arose between the GSIS Employees Association (petitioners) and the GSIS regarding a collective bargaining agreement, leading to a strike [1, 2]. GSIS Chairman Licaros allowed GSIS officials to hold office at the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) premises to ensure continuity of functions [3]. Consequently, the unions picketed the DBP premises [3]. On September 27, 1961, DBP filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Manila to prohibit the picketing [4]. Respondent Judge Lantin issued a writ of preliminary injunction *ex parte* without a hearing, upon DBP's filing of a P20,000.00 cash bond [4]. The police immediately enforced the order [4]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, alleging Judge Lantin acted without jurisdiction and contrary to Republic Act 875 [5]. During the pendency of the case, the labor dispute was amicably settled, the employees returned to work, and DBP cancelled its cash bond [5, 6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petition has become moot and academic.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that the petition was moot. The labor dispute that caused the strike and picketing was amicably settled, and the employees composing the unions returned to work [5, 6]. Furthermore, the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the lower court became moot upon the cancellation of the cash bond put up by the Development Bank of the Philippines [6]. Therefore, the petition was dismissed [6].
