I. CAPTION
AMADOR G. CAPIRAL v. MANILA ELECTRIC CO., INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-15721, December 27, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Amador G. Capiral was hired by respondent Manila Electric Company (Meralco) as a "news photographer" on a probationary basis in March 1957, and became a regular and permanent employee in August 1957 [1, 2]. On March 31, 1958, Meralco terminated his services, stating that the position was abolished for reasons of economy as it was cheaper to engage outside services [3, 4]. Capiral was given one month's full pay in lieu of notice [2].

Capiral filed a petition for Mandamus and Damages, claiming he was illegally dismissed due to union activities [5, 6]. The Court of First Instance of Manila found no evidence of unfair labor practice but ordered his reinstatement [7, 8]. The lower court reasoned that Capiral's status as a "regular and permanent" employee meant he could not be dismissed merely for the abolition of his position, unlike temporary employees under the Collective Bargaining Agreement [9]. Meralco appealed directly to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the employer can validly terminate the services of a "regular and permanent" employee who does not have a fixed period of employment.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, ruling that the dismissal was valid.

The Court held that Capiral's appointment as a "regular and permanent" employee did not convert his employment into one with a "definite period." A definite period refers to a duration limited from one fixed date to another, which was not the case here; the "permanent" status merely afforded him fringe benefits [4, 10].

Under Republic Act No. 1052 (The Termination Pay Law), in the absence of a contract fixing a specific period of employment, an employer may dismiss an employee at any time, with or without cause [11-13]. If the dismissal is without just cause, the employer must provide one month's notice or one month's pay in lieu thereof [14, 15]. Here, Meralco actually had a just cause—the abolition of the position for economy [4, 16]—but even assuming there was no cause, Meralco complied with the law by paying Capiral one month's salary [2, 4].

The decision appealed from was reversed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Reyes, J.B.L., J., concurred, noting specifically that there was no unfair labor practice [17].
Barrera, J., concurred in the result [17].
