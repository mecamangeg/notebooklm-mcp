I. CAPTION
CONRADO ESPINOSA SIGUIENTE v. THE SECRETARY OF JUSTICE, THE JUDICIAL SUPERVISOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE CHIEF ACCOUNTING OFFICER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE DISTRICT JUDGE OF SULU and ATTY. MARIANO MANAGULA, G.R. No. L-20370, November 29, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Conrado Espinosa Siguiente filed a petition for Mandamus and Prohibition to be recognized as the Justice of the Peace of Balimbing, Sulu. His claim was based on a letter submitted by outgoing President Carlos P. Garcia to the Commission on Appointments (CA) on December 26, 1961, requesting confirmation of *ad interim* appointments, including Siguiente's appointment dated May 19, 1961 [1]. The CA confirmed this appointment on May 3, 1962, and Siguiente took his oath shortly thereafter [2].

However, the appointment paper was never released from Malacañang nor delivered to the petitioner, and he had no knowledge of it prior to the confirmation [2]. Furthermore, President Diosdado Macapagal, who assumed office on December 30, 1961, issued Administrative Order No. 2 on December 31, 1961, revoking all appointments extended or released by President Garcia after December 13, 1961 [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner’s appointment is valid despite it not being released and having been revoked by the incoming President prior to confirmation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the confirmation was a mistake because there was no valid *ad interim* appointment to act upon, as the appointee had not qualified for the office at that time [3]. The Court relied on the doctrine in *Aytona vs. Castillo*, refusing to reverse the revocation of such "midnight appointments" [3].

The Court explained that President Garcia’s letter was, at most, a nomination. A nomination subject to confirmation may be changed or recalled by the Executive at will until title to the office is vested (*McChesnay vs. Sampson*) [3], [4]. President Macapagal effectively recalled this nomination via Administrative Order No. 2 before the CA met in January 1962 [3]. Furthermore, an outgoing President cannot make an appointment to take effect after he has ceased to be President, as this would forestall the rights and prerogatives of his successor (citing 67 C.J.S. p. 159) [3]. Since the CA met after Garcia's term expired, he could not validly make an appointment effective during his successor's term [3].

Petition denied; injunction dissolved [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Concepcion and Barrera concurred in the result [5].
