**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE ADOPTION OF ELIZABETH MIRA, GILBERT R. BREHM and ESTER MIRA BREHM v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18566, September 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
Gilbert R. Brehm, an American citizen serving in the U.S. Navy with a temporary assignment at Subic Bay, married Ester Mira, a Filipino citizen. Ester had a minor daughter, Elizabeth, from a previous relationship. The spouses filed a Joint Petition in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court to adopt Elizabeth. The Republic opposed the petition regarding Gilbert, arguing that as a non-resident alien, he was disqualified from adopting under Article 335(4) of the New Civil Code. Gilbert contended that his subsequent acts and intention to reside permanently in the Philippines cured the defect, and that Article 338 of the Civil Code allows a stepfather to adopt his stepchild. The lower court granted the adoption. The Solicitor General appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a non-resident alien stepfather is qualified to adopt his Filipino stepchild under the Civil Code.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court ruled that Gilbert R. Brehm is disqualified from adopting. Article 335(4) of the Civil Code expressly states that non-resident aliens *cannot* adopt. This provision is mandatory because it contains words of positive prohibition and is couched in negative terms [1]. While Article 338(3) states that a stepchild *may* be adopted by the stepfather, this provision is merely directory and can only be given operation if it does not conflict with the mandatory prohibitions of Article 335 [1, 2].

Brehm’s status as a non-resident alien was established by his temporary assignment with the U.S. Navy, and no amount of declared intention could overcome this legal disqualification [3]. The Court emphasized that the law surrounds the minor with safeguards, noting that an adopted minor might be removed from the country by a non-resident adopter and placed beyond the reach and protection of the Philippines [4].

The decision appealed from, insofar as it affects Gilbert R. Brehm, is **REVERSED**, and his petition to adopt Elizabeth Mira is **DENIED**.
