I. CAPTION
TESTATE ESTATE OF THE LATE DON ALFONSO DE CASTELLVI, Administratrix NATIVIDAD CASTELLVI DE RAQUIZA v. JOSE CASTELLVI and CONSUELO CASTELLVI, G.R. No. L-17630, October 31, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Alfonso de Castellvi died testate in Spain in 1940. His will instituted his judicially adopted daughter, petitioner Natividad Castellvi de Raquiza, as heir to two-thirds (2/3) of his estate, and his brother Juan (succeeded by collateral heirs) to the remaining one-third (1/3). Respondents Jose and Consuelo Castellvi opposed the probate, claiming to be the decedent's acknowledged natural children. On December 11, 1940, Natividad's guardian *ad litem* entered into a compromise agreement with respondents, recognizing them as natural children and stipulating that Natividad would grant them one-half of her allotted share. The lower court approved this agreement in the same order admitting the will to probate. Years later, on November 11, 1959, the lower court issued an order declaring only Natividad and the collateral heirs as the lawful heirs, effectively excluding respondents. Respondents appealed, arguing that the 1940 agreement and the court order approving it constituted *res judicata* regarding their status and right to inherit.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the compromise agreement regarding the respondents' civil status as acknowledged natural children is valid.
2. W/N the 1940 court order approving the compromise constitutes *res judicata* on the respondents' status and heirship.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The agreement is manifestly null and void. The Supreme Court held that the agreement was in the nature of a compromise regarding civil status, which is prohibited by law. Under Art. 1814 of the Spanish Civil Code (reproduced as Art. 2035 of the Civil Code of the Philippines), "No compromise can be made with respect to the civil status of persons." Consequently, the status of the respondents as alleged natural children cannot be the subject of a contract. The agreement also lacked consideration because, had the respondents successfully proven their status, they would have excluded the collateral heirs and taken from the free portion of the estate, not from Natividad's legitime.

2. **NO.** The 1940 order did not constitute *res judicata* because it contained no declaration concerning the status or filiation of the respondents, nor did it adjudicate their specific share; it merely provided that the agreement be attached to the record. Furthermore, the judicial approval was made in the order allowing the will to probate, which is not the proper procedural stage to settle questions of heirship or distributive shares. As the express agreement regarding status was void as contrary to a positive statutory injunction, neither the court order nor any implied admissions by the petitioner could cure its nullity. The order appealed from is affirmed.
