I. CAPTION
KUA SUY alias KWAN SAY DEE, ET AL. v. THE COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION, G.R. No. L-13790, October 31, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Kua Suy and her three minor sons, all Chinese nationals, entered the Philippines on June 17, 1955, as temporary visitors with an authorized stay of three months. Their stay was extended by the Secretary of Foreign Affairs pending the naturalization proceedings of Kua Suy's husband, Liu Giok In, a permanent resident. On August 2, 1957, the Foreign Affairs Department terminated the extension, and the Respondent Commissioner of Immigration ordered petitioners to leave the country within three days.

Petitioners filed a petition for injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. On August 17, 1957, the CFI of Leyte granted Liu Giok In's naturalization. Consequently, the CFI of Manila granted the injunction on March 28, 1958, ruling that the finality of the husband’s naturalization made the expulsion order untenable. The Commissioner appealed. During the pendency of the appeal, Liu Giok In took his oath of allegiance on August 24, 1959.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the wife and minor children of a newly naturalized Filipino citizen may be deported after their temporary visitor permits have expired and they were ordered to leave prior to the oath-taking.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the petitioners remained aliens and were subject to deportation.

Regarding the wife, under Section 15 of the Naturalization Act, marriage to a Filipino citizen does not automatically confer citizenship. The wife is deemed a citizen only if she "might herself be lawfully naturalized," which requires proof of her own qualifications and absence of disqualifications [1-3]. No such evidence was presented for Kua Suy.

Regarding the minor children, Section 15 extends citizenship to a foreign-born minor child only "if dwelling in the Philippines at the time of the naturalization of the parent." The Court held that "dwelling" must be construed to mean "lawful residence" [1-3]. Since the children’s authorized stay expired in 1957 and they were already required to leave the country *before* their father took his oath of allegiance in 1959, they were no longer lawfully residing in the Philippines at the time of his naturalization [3]. The Naturalization Act cannot be used as an excuse for violations of immigration laws [3].

The decision appealed from is reversed, and the writ of injunction is revoked and set aside.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Makalintal, J.** (Concurring and Dissenting): Concurred regarding the wife but dissented regarding the minors. He argued that under Section 15, the minors should be deemed Filipino citizens during their minority even if not "dwelling" (lawfully residing) in the Philippines, and thus Section 9 of the Immigration Act regarding permanent admission should not apply to them [4-6].
