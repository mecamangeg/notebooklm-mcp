I. CAPTION
ANGELES CASON, substituted by ANTONIO C. GARRETERO v. VICENTE SAN PEDRO and CARMEN FAVILA, G.R. No. L-18928, December 28, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Angeles Cason filed a complaint against defendants Vicente San Pedro and Carmen Favila regarding the construction of the latter's building [1, 2]. On July 1, 1959, defendants filed an answer with a counterclaim [2]. Subsequently, on October 19, 1959, and March 17, 1960, plaintiff served written interrogatories upon the defendants [3]. Although defendants received the interrogatories on March 19, 1960, they failed to answer them [3].

On May 11, 1960, plaintiff moved for judgment by default due to defendants' failure to answer the interrogatories [3]. Defendants opposed, claiming they were abroad and arguing that the interrogatories were improper and shifted the burden of proof [4]. On September 2, 1960, the trial court issued an order declaring defendants in default pursuant to Section 5, Rule 24 of the Rules of Court [5, 6].

On September 14, 1960, defendants filed a retaliatory motion to declare plaintiff in default for failing to answer their counterclaim [7]. The trial court denied defendants' motion for reconsideration and their motion to declare plaintiff in default [7]. After receiving plaintiff's evidence *ex parte*, the court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff [8]. Defendants appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in declaring defendants in default for failure to answer written interrogatories.
2. W/N the trial court erred in refusing to declare plaintiff in default regarding the counterclaim.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Section 5, Rule 24 of the Rules of Court expressly authorizes the court to render a default judgment against a party who fails to serve answers to written interrogatories submitted under Rule 20 after proper service [10, 11]. The Supreme Court held that the defendants and their counsel were duly served but negligently failed to answer or request an extension of time [9, 12]. The Court emphasized that the rules on interrogatories are intended to expedite trial and compel parties to lay their cards on the table, and thus may be availed of even after issues are joined [13, 14].

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the trial court was justified in refusing to act on defendants' motion to declare plaintiff in default because, at the time the motion was filed on September 14, 1960, the defendants had already been declared in default by the order dated September 2, 1960 [15]. Having been declared in default, the defendants lost their standing in court (*Lim Toco v. Go Fay*) [15].

Judgment affirmed [16].
