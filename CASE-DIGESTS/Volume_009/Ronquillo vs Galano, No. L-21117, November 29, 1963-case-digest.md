I. CAPTION
NAPOLEON F. RONQUILLO v. RAFAEL GALANO, G.R. No. L-21117, November 29, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ronquillo was extended an *ad interim* appointment as Justice of the Peace of Maripipi, Leyte, dated November 6, 1961. However, the appointment was only released on December 29, 1961. Instead of waiting for the appointment by mail, Ronquillo traveled to Manila to take his oath of office on that same day, December 29, 1961. At the time he took his oath, the incumbent Justice of the Peace, Wenceslao M. Polo, had not yet vacated the position or been released from property responsibility. Subsequently, President Macapagal issued Administrative Order No. 2 of 1962, withdrawing "midnight appointments" made by the outgoing administration. Respondent Galano was later appointed to the same position on October 11, 1962. Ronquillo filed a petition for *quo warranto* claiming he was the lawful holder of the office.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Ronquillo’s appointment was valid and effective.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that Ronquillo's appointment falls under the principle and theory of *Aytona v. Castillo* regarding "midnight appointments." First, when Ronquillo was appointed and took his oath on December 29, 1961, the position was not yet vacant as the incumbent was still holding office. Second, the circumstances—specifically the release of the appointment on the eve of the new administration and Ronquillo's rushed trip to Manila to take his oath—indicated an irregularity typical of midnight appointments. Consequently, the appointment was validly considered withdrawn by Administrative Order No. 2 of 1962.

Petition dismissed.
