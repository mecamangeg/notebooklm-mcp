I. CAPTION
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, ET AL. v. THE COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-19180, October 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner National Development Company owned the "S.S. Doña Nati," operated by agent A.V. Rocha. The Respondent Collector of Customs charged the vessel with violating Section 2521 of the Tariff and Customs Code for carrying an unmanifested RCA television set, which was owned by the ship's doctor [1]. Rocha answered the notice, explaining the TV was not cargo requiring a manifest, and requested an investigation and hearing if the explanation was deemed insufficient [2]. The Collector rejected the explanation, immediately imposed a P5,000.00 fine payable within 48 hours, and threatened to deny clearance and seize the vessel if unpaid [3]. Petitioners filed a special civil action for certiorari in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI set aside the fine as unjust and arbitrary for lack of a hearing [4]. The Collector appealed, arguing the Court of Tax Appeals had jurisdiction and that petitioners failed to exhaust administrative remedies [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the case.
2. W/N the petitioners were required to exhaust administrative remedies.
3. W/N the Collector of Customs observed due process in imposing the fine.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of First Instance correctly assumed jurisdiction. The issue involved was not the correctness of the fine's imposition (a tax matter), but whether the Collector acted properly in imposing said fine without first giving the operator an opportunity to be heard [6].

2. **NO.** While petitioners did not appeal to the Commissioner of Customs, the exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required when the respondent officer has acted in utter disregard of the principle of due process. In such cases, an administrative appeal is not considered a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law [7].

3. **NO.** The Collector committed a grave abuse of discretion and denied the elementary rule of due process. Even in administrative proceedings, the right to due process enshrined in the Constitution must be observed [8]. Citing *Ang Tibay v. Court of Industrial Relations*, the Court held that a party must be given the right to a hearing to present their case and adduce evidence [9]. Rocha was entitled to an opportunity to prove that the television set was not cargo requiring a manifest under the law, but was denied this chance when the fine was summarily imposed [8, 10].

**Decision affirmed.**
