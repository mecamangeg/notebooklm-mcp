I. CAPTION
TONG SIOK SY (nee CHAN) v. MARTINIANO P. VIVO, as Acting Commissioner of Immigration, MARCIAL RANOLA, as Acting Commissioner of Immigration, VIRGILIO GASTON, as Acting Associate Commissioner of Immigration, and THE BUREAU OF IMMIGRATION, G.R. No. L-21136, December 27, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tong Siok Sy, a Chinese citizen, married Calixto Chan, a Filipino citizen, in Taiwan on November 12, 1960 [1]. She took an oath of allegiance to the Philippines before a Filipino Vice-Consul and entered the country on May 2, 1961, documented as a Filipino citizen [1]. The Board of Special Inquiry initially investigated and voted to admit her, with the last vote cast on August 23, 1961 [1]. However, on July 14, 1962, the Board of Commissioners *motu proprio* reviewed her case, reversed the prior decision, and ordered her exclusion, declaring she lacked the necessary residence requirement to be a citizen [2]. Tong Siok Sy filed an action with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, claiming she was deprived of citizenship without due process. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the Board acted within the one-year period to reverse its decision and that she did not automatically follow her husband's citizenship as she lacked the qualifications for naturalization [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Board of Commissioners has the power to reverse the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry *motu proprio* within one year.
2. W/N the petitioner automatically became a Filipino citizen upon her marriage to a Filipino husband.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Board of Immigration Commissioners has the power to reverse its previous ruling within one year counted from the date of its promulgation [1]. The Court found that since the last Commissioner voted on the matter on August 23, 1961, the review conducted on July 14, 1962 was well within the one-year prescriptive period allowed by law [3].

2. **NO.** Under Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization Law, an alien woman married to a Filipino citizen is deemed a citizen only if she "might herself be lawfully naturalized" [4]. This requires that she possess all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications for naturalization. The Court held that marriage does not *ipso facto* make an alien woman a Filipino citizen [4]. Since the petitioner only arrived in the Philippines in 1961, she failed to satisfy the 10-year residence requirement mandated by the Naturalization Law [2]. The Court relied on the rulings in *Lo Tuan v. Commissioner of Immigration* and *Kua Suy v. Commissioner of Immigration* [4].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [3].
