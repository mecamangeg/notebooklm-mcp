**I. CAPTION**
QUA CHEE GAN, ET AL. v. THE DEPORTATION BOARD, G.R. No. L-10280, September 30, 1963, 118 Phil. 868, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
On May 12, 1952, Special Prosecutor Emilio L. Galang charged petitioners Qua Chee Gan and others before the respondent Deportation Board with economic sabotage for purchasing US dollars without a license and remitting them to Hong Kong, and for attempted bribery of public officials [1, 2]. Following the filing of charges, the presiding member of the Deportation Board issued a warrant for their arrest [3]. Petitioners posted bail but filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the Board lacked jurisdiction and that the charges were not legal grounds for deportation [4]. After the Board denied the motion, petitioners filed a petition for habeas corpus, prohibition, and certiorari, which was remanded to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [4].

The CFI upheld the validity of the delegation of the President's power to investigate to the Deportation Board and sustained the Board's power to issue warrants of arrest and fix bonds under Executive Order No. 398, series of 1951, reasoning that the power to arrest is essential to the power to deport under Section 69 of the Revised Administrative Code [5]. Petitioners appealed, questioning the President's power to deport and the Board's authority to issue warrants of arrest [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the President has the power to deport aliens under Section 69 of the Revised Administrative Code.
2. W/N the President may delegate the power to investigate deportation charges to the Deportation Board.
3. W/N the President may delegate the power to issue warrants of arrest to the Deportation Board.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** While Section 69 of the Revised Administrative Code does not expressly grant the President authority to deport, it prescribes the procedure for such action [7]. The Legislature recognized and ratified this power by expressly exempting Section 69 from the repealing clause of the Immigration Act of 1940 (Commonwealth Act No. 613) [7, 8]. Furthermore, the charges of economic sabotage constitute a valid ground for deportation under Republic Act No. 503 [9].

2. **YES.** The President’s power of investigation may be delegated. Section 69 of the Revised Administrative Code explicitly provides for a "prior investigation, conducted by said Executive or his authorized agent" [10]. The Deportation Board serves as this authorized agent [11].

3. **NO.** Conceding without deciding that the President has the implied power to order an arrest pending investigation, such power cannot be delegated to the Deportation Board [12]. The power to arrest involves the exercise of discretion to determine if the specific circumstances warrant a curtailment of liberty [12]. Under the Constitution, the determination of probable cause for a warrant is a function of a judge [13, 14]. While ministerial duties may be delegated, official functions requiring the exercise of discretion and judgment cannot [12]. Executive Order No. 398, insofar as it empowers the Board to issue warrants of arrest and fix bonds, is illegal [15].

**Disposition:** The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**. Executive Order No. 398 is declared illegal regarding the power to issue arrest warrants; the order of arrest issued by the Deportation Board is declared null and void, and the bonds filed are cancelled [15].
