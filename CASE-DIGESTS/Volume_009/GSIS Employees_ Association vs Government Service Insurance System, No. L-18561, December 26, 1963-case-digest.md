I. CAPTION
GSIS EMPLOYEES’ ASSOCIATION AND PEDRO OLASE v. GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM AND COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-18561, December 26, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On January 7, 1960, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ordered the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) to reinstate Pedro Olase, an employee dismissed for alleged swindling, but denied him back wages as the dismissal was done in good faith [1, 2]. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court (G.R. Nos. L-17186 and L-17363) [3]. Pending appeal, Olase moved for the execution of the reinstatement order pursuant to Section 14 of Commonwealth Act No. 103 [3]. GSIS opposed, arguing that the pending appeals and "loss of confidence" warranted a stay [4]. On November 16, 1960, the CIR stayed the execution of reinstatement for "special and valid grounds," conditioning it on GSIS posting a P1,000 bond [4]. Olase filed this petition for certiorari with mandamus to review the order staying execution [5]. On October 31, 1961, the Supreme Court decided the main appeals, affirming Olase's reinstatement without back wages [6]. Consequently, GSIS reinstated Olase on January 22, 1962 [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition to review the CIR order staying the execution of reinstatement should be granted.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court dismissed the petition as moot. The respondent GSIS had already reinstated petitioner Pedro Olase to his former position on January 22, 1962, following the Supreme Court's decision in the main cases (G.R. Nos. L-17186 and L-17363) which affirmed the reinstatement order [7]. Since the reinstatement sought by the petitioner had already been effected, the Court found it unnecessary to resolve the issue regarding the stay of execution. The Court expressly declined to pass upon the legality of the award of back wages accruing during the pendency of the appeal, noting that this issue was the subject of another pending appeal (G.R. No. L-19988) [7].

Accordingly, the petition is **DISMISSED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
