I. CAPTION
ESPERANZA ESPIRITU and ANTONIA APOSTOL v. FRANCISCO VALERIO, G.R. No. L-18018, December 26, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Francisco Valerio filed an action to quiet title over a parcel of unregistered land in Mangatarem, Pangasinan [1]. He claimed ownership based on a deed of sale executed by Pelagia Vegilia on January 31, 1955, which he registered under Act 3344 on June 16, 1955 [1, 2]. Petitioners Espiritu and Apostol countered that they owned the land by inheritance from Santiago Apostol, who allegedly bought it from Mariano Vegilia in 1934, who in turn bought it from Pelagia Vegilia in 1932 [3]. Petitioners’ deeds were registered under Act 3344 eleven days before Valerio’s deed [2]. The trial court, however, found the petitioners' documents (Exhibits 1 and 2) to be falsified and fictitious based on physical evidence and the testimony of the alleged vendors denying the transactions [4, 5]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision declaring Valerio the owner [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners have a better right to the property under Article 1544 of the Civil Code because they registered their sale prior to the respondent.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that while the vendee whose deed of sale is first registered under Act 3344 generally has a better right in cases of double sale of unregistered land, this rule presupposes that both sales are valid [7, 8]. Where the deed of sale relied upon by the first registrant is found to be a forgery or fictitious, Article 1544 of the Civil Code does not apply [5, 7]. Since the Court of Appeals affirmed the factual finding that the petitioners' deeds were falsified, their prior registration confers no right, and the respondent's rights under the genuine deed must prevail.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
