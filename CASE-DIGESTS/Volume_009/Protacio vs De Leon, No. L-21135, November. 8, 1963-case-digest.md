I. CAPTION
DELFIN PROTACIO v. ELEUTERIO DE LEON and the COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-21135, November 8, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
In the November 10, 1959 elections for Mayor of Parañaque, Rizal, the Municipal Board of Canvassers proclaimed respondent Eleuterio De Leon as the winner over petitioner Delfin Protacio by a margin of 33 votes. Protacio filed an election protest with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, which declared him the winner by 7 votes [1]. De Leon appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA). Initially, the CA affirmed Protacio’s victory with a margin of 5 votes, but upon a motion for reconsideration, the CA promulgated an amended decision declaring De Leon the winner by 20 votes [2]. Protacio appealed to the Supreme Court via certiorari, challenging the CA's appreciation of specific ballots, alleging errors in validating and invalidating votes based on rules regarding marked ballots and voter intent [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the disputed ballots were correctly appreciated as valid or invalid based on the rules regarding marked ballots and voter identification.

IV. RULING
**PARTIALLY YES and PARTIALLY NO.** The Supreme Court reviewed the specific ballots assigned as errors and modified the vote count, ultimately affirming De Leon's victory.

1.  **Marked Ballots (Invalid):** The Court ruled that ballots containing names of prominent movie stars (e.g., "Armando Goyena") who were not candidates were marked and invalid, as the only purpose was to identify the vote [4]. Similarly, ballots where a registered voter's name was written and matched the signature on the registry list were invalid [5]. Ballots containing irrelevant epithets like "saging" (banana) [6], "Minte" or "Kabayan" in block letters [7], or the phrase "Liberal Party" written eleven times were declared invalid as marked for identification purposes [8]. Writing a distinct Christian name ("Lavilla") different from the candidate's name ("Eleuterio") also invalidated the vote [9].
2.  **Valid Ballots:** The Court held that the use of "sorry" after a cancelled name is merely an expression of regret for a mistake and does not mark the ballot [10]. Words like "Street", "Grand Alliance", or "and party" were valid as vestiges of the block-voting system or for emphasis [11]. Ballots voting for "Delfin Antonio" were valid for Protacio, as evidence *aliunde* proved he was known as "Dr. Antonio" due to his pharmacy, "Farmacia Antonio" [12].
3.  **Expert Testimony:** The Court ruled it is not bound to accept the opinions of handwriting experts (NBI) "as is," especially when the Court's own examination reveals errors in the expert's conclusions [13].
4.  **Voting Time:** Although it was proven that some ballots were cast after 6:00 PM, they were held valid because they could not be segregated from those cast on time, and invalidating them would disenfranchise valid voters [14].

**Disposition:** After the re-appreciation of ballots, De Leon obtained 5,154 votes against Protacio’s 5,146. Judgment affirmed with modifications; Eleuterio De Leon is declared the duly elected Mayor with a majority of 8 votes [15].
