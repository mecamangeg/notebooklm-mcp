I. CAPTION
CRISTINO ORA-A v. JUDGE JOSE M. ANGUSTIA and PAZ BAYOT VDA. DE CORPUS, G.R. No. L-16711, December 24, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Paz Bayot Vda. de Corpus filed an ejectment and collection of rentals case against petitioner Cristino Ora-a in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Masbate regarding a foreshore land she applied to lease from the government [1, 2]. Ora-a moved to dismiss, arguing the JP Court lacked jurisdiction because the land was public and Bayot’s lease application was not yet approved [1, 2]. The JP Court denied the motion and ruled in favor of Bayot, ordering Ora-a to vacate and pay rent [2, 3]. Instead of appealing, Ora-a filed a petition for *certiorari* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Masbate, claiming the JP Court lacked jurisdiction as the case involved ownership [4]. The CFI granted the petition and annulled the JP proceedings, ruling that Bayot’s lack of ownership and unapproved lease made the issue one of ownership, divesting the lower court of jurisdiction [5]. Bayot appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Justice of the Peace Court had jurisdiction over the ejectment case.
2. W/N *certiorari* was the proper remedy for the petitioner.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Justice of the Peace Court had jurisdiction because the complaint was a simple action for detainer, describing a sublease, default, and refusal to vacate [6]. The defense questioning Bayot's right to sublease public land did not convert the issue into one of ownership, as neither party claimed to own the land [7]. Bayot merely asserted rights as a government lessee [7]. Furthermore, under Sec. 67(b), Rule 123 of the Rules of Court, a sublessee is estopped from denying the title of the sublessor [7].

2. **NO.** The proper remedy against the adverse decision of the Justice of the Peace was an appeal, not *certiorari* [6, 8]. The question of whether Bayot’s lease application had been approved was a question of fact for the lower court to decide [9]. Errors in deciding questions of fact or law do not deprive the court of jurisdiction and must be corrected by appeal [9]. The alleged illegality of the sublease did not affect the court's jurisdiction [10].

The order of the Court of First Instance is reversed, and the petition for *certiorari* is denied.
