I. CAPTION
MANILA HOTEL COMPANY v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and PINES HOTEL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION, G.R. No. L-18873, September 30, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Pines Hotel Employees Association filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against petitioner Manila Hotel Company, demanding additional compensation for overtime, Sunday, legal holiday, and nighttime work [1]. The CIR ruled in favor of the employees [2]. When the Examining Division submitted a report calculating the amount due at P32,950.69, the petitioner objected to the inclusion of 22 employees who were not actually in the service of the hotel at the time the petition was filed [3]. Petitioner argued that because these individuals were not currently employed, their claim was a simple money claim under the jurisdiction of regular courts, not the CIR [3]. The trial judge overruled this objection, noting that the employees were re-employed while the case was pending [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR has jurisdiction over the claims of regular seasonal employees who were not in actual service at the time the petition was filed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the CIR retained jurisdiction. Although the 22 employees were not in actual service at the time of filing, they were subsequently re-employed while the incident was pending consideration [4]. The Court established the doctrine regarding "regular seasonal employees," stating that such employees are called to work from time to time, mostly during the summer season [5]. During the off-season, they are not separated from the service but are merely considered on leave of absence without pay; their employment relationship is never severed but only suspended [5], [4]. Therefore, they are considered to be in the regular employment of the hotel [5], [4].

The order appealed from is affirmed [6].
