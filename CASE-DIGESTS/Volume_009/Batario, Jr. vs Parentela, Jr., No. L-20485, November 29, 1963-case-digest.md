I. CAPTION
DEMETRIO M. BATARIO, JR. v. JOSE J. PARENTELA, JR., G.R. No. L-20485, November 29, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On December 13, 1961, President Garcia extended an *ad interim* appointment to petitioner Batario as Justice of the Peace of Sariaya, Quezon [1]. At that time, the incumbent was still serving until his retirement on December 26, 1961 [1]. Batario took his oath on December 26, 1961, and his appointment was confirmed by the Commission on Appointments on May 14, 1962 [1]. However, on October 19, 1962, President Macapagal appointed respondent Parentela as *ad interim* Justice of the Peace; Parentela took over the office on October 30, 1962, and was confirmed on May 23, 1963 [2]. Batario filed a *quo warranto* petition claiming he was the *de jure* officer [2]. Respondent argued, among others, that Batario lacked the statutory qualification of three years of legal practice at the time of his appointment, as Batario was admitted to the Bar only on May 9, 1959 [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Batario has a clear right to the office of Justice of the Peace despite lacking the required years of legal practice at the time of his appointment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that in *quo warranto* proceedings, the petitioner must demonstrate a clear right to the office or the exercise thereof [4]. Under Section 71 of Republic Act No. 2613, a Justice of the Peace must have practiced law in the Philippines for at least three years [5]. Batario was admitted to the Bar on May 9, 1959 [6]. On the date of his appointment (December 13, 1961) and even when he took his oath (December 26, 1961), he had been in the legal profession for only about 2 years and 7 months [6]. The Court rejected Batario's argument that his confirmation cured this defect, ruling that since he lacked the necessary qualifications at the time of appointment and assumption of office, he failed to establish a clear title to the position [4, 6].

The Writ was denied [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Barrera, J. concurred in the result [7].
