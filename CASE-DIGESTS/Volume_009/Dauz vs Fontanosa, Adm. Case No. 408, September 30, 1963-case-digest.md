I. CAPTION
GERVASIO DAUZ v. NAPOLEON O. FONTANOSA, Adm. Case No. 408, September 30, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Atty. Fontanosa was engaged by Complainant Dauz to file three collection cases in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Kidapawan, Cotabato. They entered a written contract stipulating a fee of P100.00 per case. Subsequently, Dauz terminated Respondent’s services and requested the return of the documents entrusted to him. Respondent refused to return the documents, claiming a lien over them until his stipulated fees were paid. Dauz moved for a *subpoena duces tecum* in the JP Court to compel the production of the documents, but the motion was denied on the ground that the documents were privileged and subject to an attorney's lien. Consequently, the collection cases were dismissed without prejudice for failure to prosecute. Dauz filed this administrative case charging Respondent with malpractice for refusing to return the documents and for alleged laxity in handling the cases due to numerous postponements.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Respondent is guilty of laxity in the performance of his duties due to the postponements.
2. W/N Respondent committed malpractice by refusing to return the client’s documents due to an unpaid fee claim.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the charge of laxity was unfounded. The record showed that the hearings were postponed several times, but not all were upon the Respondent's petition; some were granted upon the request of the adverse party, and others upon the joint motion of the parties [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The Respondent's refusal to return the documents was not devoid of justification. While such refusal "may not be the proper conduct," Respondent believed in good faith that he was entitled to a retaining lien until his fees, agreed upon in writing, were paid [1, 2]. The Court noted that if the JP Court erred in sustaining the lien and refusing the *subpoena duces tecum*, the Complainant’s proper remedy was to appeal the order of dismissal to the Court of First Instance and renew the motion for the issuance of the subpoena there. Complainant failed to utilize this remedy [3].

Charges dismissed [4].
