I. CAPTION
GREGORIO GUECO, ET AL. v. ATANASIA VDA. DE LACSON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16928, September 30, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
In 1928, the Court of First Instance of Pampanga decreed the registration of Lot 343 in the name of Faustina Baron, subject to *reserva troncal* in favor of the plaintiffs (Gueco et al.), conditioned on their survival of Baron [1]. This reservation was annotated on the Original Certificate of Title [2]. In 1949, Baron sold the land to her son, Emilio B. Lacson, and the annotation was carried over to his Transfer Certificate of Title [3]. Emilio died in 1952, and his widow, defendant Atanasia Vda. de Lacson, was appointed executrix [3].

Faustina Baron (the *reservista*) died in 1955 [3]. The plaintiffs, as the surviving *reservatarios*, demanded the delivery of the reserved land [4]. The defendant refused, arguing that the plaintiffs were actually fourth-degree relatives of the prepositus (Felix Layug) and thus not legally entitled to *reserva troncal* under the Civil Code, making the 1928 cadastral declaration void and *ultra vires* [5]. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, ordering the conveyance of the land [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendant can challenge the validity of the plaintiffs' status as *reservatarios* after the decree of registration containing the *reserva* annotation has become final.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the Land Registration Court (Cadastral Court) is vested with jurisdiction under Section 2 of Act 496 to hear and determine all questions arising upon applications for registration, including the right of a reservee affecting the land [7]. While the Civil Code ordinarily determines entitlement upon the death of the *reservista*, this rule cannot undermine a final judicial decree [7].

Since the 1928 decree recognizing the plaintiffs' right was not appealed, it became conclusive. Citing *Cano v. Director of Lands*, the Court emphasized that once the decree becomes final, all persons are barred from contesting the constituent elements of the *reserva*. The only requisites for the passing of title are: (1) the death of the *reservista*, and (2) the fact that the *reservatario* survived the *reservista* [8].

The petition is denied, and the judgment affirmed.
