I. CAPTION
MARIQUITA CAPARAS, et al. v. PEDRO D. OFIANA, et al., G.R. No. L-21614, October 31, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Majors Gatchalian and Fernandez filed a complaint with the Provincial Fiscal of Bulacan against petitioners for violations of the Internal Revenue Code and Tariff and Customs Code. During the preliminary investigation, petitioners challenged the Fiscal's jurisdiction, arguing the offense was committed in Ilocos Sur. The Fiscal overruled this contention. Petitioners then filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan to restrain the Fiscal from proceeding. The CFI dismissed the petition, prompting petitioners to appeal to the Supreme Court. While the appeal was pending, the Fiscal filed the corresponding criminal information (Criminal Case No. 5550) against petitioners. Respondents then moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing it had become academic.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed for being academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court granted the motion to dismiss the appeal. The Court reasoned that the original purpose of the petition for prohibition was to restrain the Fiscal from conducting the preliminary investigation and filing the information. Since the information had already been filed in Criminal Case No. 5550, the issue of whether the Fiscal or the CFI of Bulacan has jurisdiction can now be properly raised in that specific criminal case.

The Court applied the principle that a special civil action for prohibition is proper only upon a showing that the aggrieved party has no remedy by appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. As petitioners can now question the jurisdiction in the pending criminal case, they possess an adequate remedy, rendering the present appeal purely academic.

The motion to dismiss the appeal is granted.
