**I. CAPTION**
LU BENG GA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18005, November 29, 1963, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Lu Beng Ga, a Chinese citizen and merchant residing in Davao City since 1946, filed a petition for naturalization on August 6, 1958. He had a wife and five children. The Court of First Instance of Davao granted his petition over the opposition of the Provincial Fiscal. The Republic appealed, contending that the petitioner failed to file a declaration of intention and failed to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during his residence in the Philippines. Specifically, the Republic pointed out that the petitioner failed to enroll his third child, Chin Bon, in school even after the child reached school age during the pendency of the proceedings, and failed to register his children under the Alien Registration Act.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner's failure to register his children under the Alien Registration Act disqualifies him from naturalization.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The petitioner is disqualified because he failed to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner. The Court found that the petitioner failed to register his children as required by the Alien Registration Act (Republic Act No. 562). Section 10 of said Act imposes the duty on the parent or legal guardian of an alien under fourteen years of age to report for such alien.

Citing the cases of *In re Chung Hong v. Republic* and *Benjamin Go v. Republic*, the Court ruled that the violation of the Alien Registration Act constitutes an offense and is a sufficient ground for the denial or disapproval of a petition for naturalization. Having found the petitioner disqualified on this ground, the Court deemed it unnecessary to decide the other issues raised.

The petition for naturalization was **DISMISSED**.
