I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE CHANGE OF NAME OF TRINIDAD R. ASENSI, TRINIDAD R. ASENSI, represented by her father, GRACIANO ASENSI v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18047, December 26, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Trinidad Rodriguez was the natural child of Graciano Asensi and Luisa Rodriguez, who were both single at the time of her conception and birth. Her parents subsequently married, and she was taken into the fold of their family, legally establishing her status as a legitimated child [1].

Trinidad, represented by her father, filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Cebu to change her surname from "Rodriguez" to "Asensi" to adopt her parents' surname [1]. The trial court granted the petition. The Republic, through the Solicitor General, appealed the decision, arguing that judicial approval was unnecessary because a legitimated child is already entitled by law to use the father's surname [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for change of name may be granted to judicially confirm a legitimated child's use of her parents' surname.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that there is no legal prohibition against obtaining judicial confirmation of a legal right [2]. Although a legitimated child has the clear right to adopt the parents' surnames, the Court found the Government's opposition—based on the argument that judicial approval was unnecessary—to be "too technical and a waste of time and effort" [3]. The petition was properly granted to formally confirm this right [2].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [4].
