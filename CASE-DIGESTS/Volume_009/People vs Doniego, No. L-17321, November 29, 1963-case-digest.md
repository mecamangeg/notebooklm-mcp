**I. CAPTION**
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SANTOS DONIEGO**, G.R. No. L-17321, November 29, 1963, Padilla, J.

**II. FACTS**
On the night of July 1, 1957, during a barrio fiesta dance in Gonzaga, Cagayan, Domingo Doniego was stabbed to death by one Camilo Ragual. Santos Doniego, Domingo’s father, arrived at the scene and asked who killed his son. Upon being told it was Ragual, Santos shouted, unsheathed his bolo, and indiscriminately assaulted the people present. He wounded Vicente Pescador and Avelino Paet, and stabbed Anselmo Garcia, Ciriaco Palor, and Maximo Viernes, resulting in the deaths of the latter three [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance of Cagayan convicted Santos of three murders, finding the crimes attended by treachery and evident premeditation [3-5]. Santos appealed, claiming self-defense and challenging the credibility of prosecution witnesses [4, 6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the killing was attended by treachery (*alevosia*), qualifying the crime to murder.
2. W/N evident premeditation was present.
3. W/N the accused is entitled to any mitigating circumstances.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that treachery was not present. While the initial assault on Vicente Pescador may have been sudden, the subsequent assaults on the three deceased victims (Garcia, Palor, and Viernes) could not be deemed unexpected, as the first attack must have put them on guard [5, 7]. Treachery requires that the offender avail himself of means to ensure the execution of the crime without risk to himself arising from the defense the offended party might make; such means were not availed of by the appellant here [5].

2. **NO.** The Court found evident premeditation absent because the appellant hacked his victims indiscriminately in a fit of rage immediately after seeing his son dead, without the cold and reflective planning required for premeditation [5].

3. **YES.** The Court appreciated the mitigating circumstance of immediate vindication of a grave offense (the killing of his son) or acting upon an impulse so powerful as naturally to have produced passion or obfuscation [5]. The Court noted that while these two circumstances cannot co-exist, they may attend the commission of the crime alternatively [5, 8, 9].

Consequently, the crime committed is **Homicide**, not Murder. The penalty was modified to *reclusion temporal* in its minimum period due to the presence of a mitigating circumstance [10]. The decision was **AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION**, sentencing Santos Doniego to an indeterminate penalty of 10 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 14 years and 8 months of *reclusion temporal* for each of the three homicides [10, 11].
