**I. CAPTION**
**J. M. TUASON & CO., INC. v. JARAMILLO, ET AL.,** G.R. Nos. L-18932-34 (consolidated with L-19024-35 and L-19036-44), September 30, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner J. M. Tuason & Co. filed separate actions for recovery of possession against respondents (occupants of Tatalon Estate) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon City [1]. The CFI rendered decisions ordering respondents to vacate the premises and pay damages [2]. Respondents failed to appeal these decisions, causing them to become final and executory [2].

Subsequently, respondents filed petitions for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of Appeals (CA) to enjoin the CFI from enforcing the writs of execution [3]. They claimed rights under a 1953 Compromise Agreement between Tuason & Co. and the "Deudors," and cited pending expropriation proceedings for the Tatalon Estate [4, 5]. The CA issued a consolidated decision granting the writs for those respondents whose names appeared in the Compromise Agreement list [6]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the CA lacked jurisdiction [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to entertain the petitions and issue writs of certiorari and prohibition.
2. W/N the execution of the final ejectment judgments may be suspended due to the Compromise Agreement or pending expropriation.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, certiorari, injunction, and prohibition only *in aid of its appellate jurisdiction* [7]. Since the judgments in the ejectment cases were already final and executory, and the orders of execution were not appealable (as there was no allegation that they varied the tenor of the judgments), the parties had no right to appeal to the CA; hence, there was no appellate jurisdiction to aid [7]. Furthermore, the issues raised regarding the CFI's power to execute judgments and the suspension thereof were pure questions of law, which fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court pursuant to the Judiciary Act [8].

2. **NO.** Regarding the Compromise Agreement, the respondents were not parties to the agreement and failed to allege or prove that they were included in "Annex B" (the list of recognized buyers) or that they had filed actions to enforce rights as buyers before the judgments became final [9, 10]. Unlike the case of *Evangelista v. Deudor*, respondents established no contractual relation with the petitioner [11]. Regarding expropriation, the Court held that until condemnation proceedings are fully instituted and possession is taken by the condemnor, the enforcement of a final decree of eviction cannot be constitutionally suspended [12].

The writs prayed for are **GRANTED**, and the consolidated decision of the Court of Appeals is **ANNULLED and SET ASIDE** [13].
