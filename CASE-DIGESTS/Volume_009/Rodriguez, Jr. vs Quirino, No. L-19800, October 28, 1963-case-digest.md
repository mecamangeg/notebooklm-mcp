I. CAPTION
ERNESTO R. RODRIGUEZ, JR. v. CARLOS QUIRINO, G.R. No. L-19800, October 28, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rodriguez was appointed *ad interim* as Director of Public Libraries by President Garcia. Although the appointment was dated June 1, 1961, it was not communicated to him until December 30, 1961, via telegram. The appointment was submitted to the Commission on Appointments on December 29, 1961. Petitioner took his oath on January 5, 1962, before a notary public whose commission had already expired. Subsequently, President Macapagal issued Administrative Order No. 2 recalling "midnight appointments."

Respondent Quirino was designated Acting Director by President Macapagal on April 10, 1962. Despite this, the Commission on Appointments confirmed Petitioner’s appointment on April 27, 1962. Petitioner refused to vacate the office and filed a petition for *quo warranto* claiming the position.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner’s *ad interim* appointment is valid despite being released on the last days of the outgoing administration ("midnight appointment").
2. W/N the subsequent confirmation by the Commission on Appointments validated the appointment.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the appointment falls under the ban on "midnight appointments" established in *Aytona v. Castillo* [1]. Although dated June 1, 1961, the appointment was kept secret and only communicated on December 30, 1961, indicating an intent by the appointing power to make the selection final only at the end of the term, thereby subverting the checking power of the Commission on Appointments [2].

Furthermore, the Court held that *ad interim* appointments are exceptional and justifiable only by a clear and present urgency to prevent the paralyzation of functions [1]. Since Petitioner was already serving as Acting Director, there was no exigency requiring an *ad interim* appointment that dispensed with legislative scrutiny [3]. The lack of urgency and the secrecy rendered the appointment an abuse of executive power and void *ab initio* [3], [4].

2. **NO.** Since the appointment was void *ab initio* for violating the purpose and spirit of the Constitution, it could not be validated by the subsequent confirmation of the Commission on Appointments [4]. Additionally, the Petitioner's oath was void as it was taken before a notary with an expired commission [5].

**Petition denied.**

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Barrera, J. (Concurring):** Concurs in the denial of the writ but disagrees with the majority's ruling that the Court may inquire into the "necessity" of filling vacancies. He argues that determining the need for an appointment is primarily an Executive responsibility and judicial scrutiny of such necessity may force the Executive to resort to "acting" appointments, which are more susceptible to abuse [6].
