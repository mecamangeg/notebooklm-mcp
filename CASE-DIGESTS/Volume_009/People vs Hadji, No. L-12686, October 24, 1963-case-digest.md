**I. CAPTION**
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. KAMLON HADJI, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-12686, October 24, 1963, Per Curiam.

**II. FACTS**
Kamlon Hadji, a known outlaw who had previously violated the conditions of a pardon for rebellion, was charged with various crimes, including kidnapping with murder. The prosecution established that Kamlon and his armed companions abducted Hatib Ajibun and Jamalul Ailing. Kamlon later ordered Ailing to be tied up and shot him, after which his companion beheaded the corpse. Ajibun was released after paying a fine. Kamlon denied the killing, claiming Ailing was killed by others during an attempted abduction of a woman. The trial court rejected this version and convicted Kamlon of kidnapping with murder, sentencing him to death [1-5].

On appeal, Kamlon argued that the delay of 21 months in filing the case cast doubt on the prosecution's veracity. Legally, he contended that under the doctrine in *People v. Hernandez* and *People v. Geronimo*, the acts of violence were committed in furtherance of sedition and should be deemed absorbed in that crime rather than treated as a separate complex crime [6, 7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the delay in prosecution negates the veracity of the charge.
2. W/N the crime of kidnapping with murder is absorbed by the crime of sedition.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that while undue delay can be suspicious, this does not apply when the delay is caused by factors beyond the government's control. In this case, the 21-month delay was due to the witnesses' fear of reprisal from Kamlon and his followers, which only subsided during military operations [8].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the doctrine of absorption applied in *Hernandez* and *Geronimo* pertains to **rebellion**, not sedition. Citing *People v. Cabrera* and *People v. Umali*, the Court affirmed that common offenses like murder are distinct and independent acts separable from sedition [7, 9]. Furthermore, for absorption to apply, the acts must be committed for political ends and charged as such. Here, the information contained no allegation of political motivation, and the evidence showed the killing was motivated purely by personal vengeance [10].

The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, sentencing Kamlon to death for kidnapping complexed with murder [11, 12].
