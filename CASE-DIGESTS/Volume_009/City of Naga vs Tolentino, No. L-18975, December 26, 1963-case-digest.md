**I. CAPTION**
CITY OF NAGA v. BELEN R. TOLENTINO, G.R. No. L-18975, December 26, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Defendant-appellant Belen Tolentino leased two doors in the City of Naga public market, agreeing to pay a monthly rental of P51.00. In 1949, the City Council enacted an ordinance increasing the rental to P120.00. Tolentino, along with others, filed a previous case (G.R. No. L-6815) to annul the ordinance, arguing it was ultra vires. During the pendency of that case, Tolentino continued paying only the original P51.00 rate. After the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the validity of the ordinance in G.R. No. L-6815, the City demanded payment for the accrued rental differentials from 1949 to 1958. Tolentino refused to pay, contending that the City's claim was barred because it was not set up as a compulsory counterclaim in the annulment case. The Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur ruled in favor of the City, ordering Tolentino to pay P11,165.00. Tolentino appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the City’s claim for increased rentals is barred by its failure to set it up as a compulsory counterclaim in the previous case regarding the validity of the ordinance.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court ruled that the failure to set up the claim in the previous case does not constitute a bar under Section 6, Rule 10 of the Rules of Court. For a counterclaim to be compulsory, it must arise out of or be necessarily connected with the transaction involved in the case. The main issue in the previous case was the validity of the ordinance. The determination of that issue was prejudicial to the City's right to collect; until the ordinance was declared valid, the claim for increased rent was not yet due and was considered premature. Thus, it was not a compulsory counterclaim. The present action arises from the contract of lease and the enforcement of the now-valid ordinance, which is distinct from the issue of the ordinance's enactment litigated previously.

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
