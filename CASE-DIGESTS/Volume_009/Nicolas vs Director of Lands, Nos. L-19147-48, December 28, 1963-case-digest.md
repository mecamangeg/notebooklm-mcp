I. CAPTION
**ALBINO NICOLAS, ET AL. v. THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS and GUILLERMO CAMUNGAO**, G.R. Nos. L-19147-48, December 28, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
In 1951, Albino Nicolas and Eusebio Coloma filed applications to register two lots under the Torrens System [1]. Guillermo Camungao (petitioner-appellant) filed a written appearance opposing the registration, alleging the lots belonged to him via a Sales Application awarded by the Director of Lands [1]. The Director of Lands also opposed [1].

The trial court issued an Order of General Default, erroneously ignoring Camungao's written opposition because it was not sworn [1, 2]. Consequently, Camungao was not notified of the hearings [1]. Judgment was rendered adjudicating the lands to the applicants [1]. Camungao only learned of the decision when an eviction order was issued against him [1, 3].

Camungao filed a petition to set aside the decision (review of decree), alleging **actual fraud**: the applicants intentionally omitted his actual physical possession of the land and failed to disclose that he was an adjoining owner to mislead the court [3-5]. The applicants moved to dismiss the petition, arguing lack of cause of action and that Camungao's unsworn opposition gave him no standing [6]. The lower court dismissed the petition, ruling that the allegations did not constitute actual fraud and that Camungao was not deprived of his day in court because his opposition was formally defective [2, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for review of the decree of registration was properly dismissed for lack of cause of action.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal and remanded the case for proper proceedings [8].

The Court ruled that there was a sufficient allegation of **actual fraud** in the petition [9]. Actual fraud includes the intentional omission of a fact required by law to be stated in the application. The Court cited *Estiva v. Alvero*, holding that it is fraud to knowingly omit or conceal a fact, such as the petitioner's actual physical possession, to obtain a benefit to the prejudice of a third person [9].

Furthermore, the Court held that Camungao's written appearance, though unsworn, was a **substantial compliance** with the law [10]. It was valid and sufficient to give him legal standing and the right to notice [10]. The lower court erred in ignoring this opposition.

Finally, the Court emphasized that if a judge doubts the veracity of the fraudulent acts alleged, the proper procedure is to deny the motion to dismiss and proceed to a hearing on the merits, rather than dismissing the petition summarily [9].

The decision appealed from was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the court of origin for proper proceedings [8].
