I. CAPTION
J.M. TUASON & CO., INC. v. CORNELIO M. AGUILA, G.R. No. L-16757, November 29, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On May 7, 1959, J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. filed an action to recover possession of a parcel of land in Quezon City against Cornelio M. Aguila. On September 8, 1959, the trial court rendered judgment ordering Aguila to vacate the property. Aguila’s counsel received a copy of the decision on September 14, 1959. Aguila filed a motion for new trial on September 30, 1959, which was denied. His subsequent appeal was disapproved for being perfected beyond the reglementary period, making the judgment final.

On January 5, 1960, Aguila filed an urgent motion for relief from judgment [1], [2]. The trial court denied the motion on January 9, 1960, ruling that it was filed more than 60 days after Aguila’s counsel received the decision [2]. Aguila appealed the denial to the Supreme Court, admitting his counsel’s mistakes but asking that the motion for relief be treated as a second motion for new trial to serve substantial justice [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the motion for relief from judgment was properly denied.
2. W/N the motion for relief from judgment may be considered as a second motion for new trial.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The motion was filed beyond the reglementary period. Under Section 3 of Rule 38 of the Rules of Court, a petition for relief must be filed within 60 days after the petitioner learns of the judgment, order, or other proceeding to be set aside [4]. Since Aguila’s counsel received the decision on September 14, 1959, and the motion for relief was filed only on January 5, 1960, the filing clearly exceeded the 60-day limit [4].

2. **NO.** A motion for relief from judgment cannot be treated as a second motion for new trial after it has been denied for being filed out of time [3]. The Court found no justifiable reason to accede to Aguila's request, noting that the motion for relief contained grounds other than those allowed in a motion for new trial [3]. Technicalities of procedure are not disregarded where the motion fails to comply with the Rules.

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [5].
