I. CAPTION
GABRIEL ROLDAN v. PEDRO MONSANTO, G.R. No. L-21578, November 8, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
In the general elections of November 10, 1959, for the office of mayor of Catmon, Cebu, the board of canvassers proclaimed Pedro Monsanto elected with 1,706 votes against Gabriel Roldan’s 1,074 votes [1]. Roldan filed a protest in the Court of First Instance (CFI), which, after revising the ballots, found Monsanto still elected but with a reduced plurality of 26 votes [1]. Roldan appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the CFI decision but further reduced Monsanto’s majority to 10 votes [1]. Roldan then filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court. In his petition, Roldan alleged general errors regarding the CA's appreciation of 67 ballots and another set of 56 ballots, claiming they contained marks or incorrect names, but he failed to designate the specific ballots or specify the objections for each [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Appeals may review a ruling on a ballot *motu proprio* even if it was not the object of appeal.
2. W/N the Supreme Court may review and revise all ballots in contested precincts in a petition for certiorari based on general allegations of error.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Revised Election Code considers an election protest similar to a criminal case, wherein on appeal the case is tried *de novo* [4]. Therefore, the Court of Appeals may review a ruling of the court of first instance on any ballot *motu proprio*, whether the ballot had been the object of appeal or not [5].

2. **NO.** A petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court is not an ordinary appeal and does not authorize the review and revision of all ballots in contested precincts without specific allegations of the supposed errors committed by the Court of Appeals [6, 7]. The Supreme Court is limited to examining errors that are expressly and specifically pointed out [7, 8]. Because the petitioner failed to designate the specific ballots among the groups of 67 and 56 questioned ballots, the Court could not examine the individual ballots or rule on the alleged errors [3, 7].

Petition denied [9].
