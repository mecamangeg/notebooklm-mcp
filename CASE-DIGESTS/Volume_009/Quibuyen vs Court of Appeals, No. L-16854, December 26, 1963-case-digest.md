**I. CAPTION**
PATROCINIO QUIBUYEN, SERVILLANO QUIBUYEN, and JOSE V. KAYANAN v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, JUDGE HIGINIO MACADAEG, RIZALINA T. PULIDO and PANTALEON PULIDO, G.R. No. L-16854, December 26, 1963, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondents Pulido filed a civil case against petitioners Quibuyen. Petitioners were declared in default, and judgment was rendered against them. Their "Petition for Relief from Judgment" was denied by the trial court in an Order dated January 5, 1959 [1]. Petitioners attempted to appeal, but the trial court issued an Order on April 27, 1959, denying the appeal and granting a writ of execution [1].

Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA) to annul the trial court's order. However, the CA dismissed the petition because it failed to attach the "order sought to be annulled" and other supporting papers, citing Section 2, Rule 49 of the Rules of Court [2, 3]. The CA noted that the prayer asked to annul the order of "January 5, 1959," but no copy of that order was attached [3, 4]. Petitioners moved for reconsideration, arguing they had attached the Order of April 27, 1959 (Annex A), which was the actual order assailed, and that the reference to the January 5 order in the prayer was a clerical error. They also submitted the missing documents with their motion, but the CA denied reconsideration [4, 5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the petition for certiorari for being fatally defective due to lack of supporting papers.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision. The Court held that the error in the prayer—designating the order of January 5, 1959 instead of April 27, 1959—was a mere case of *lapsus calami* (slip of the pen) [6, 7]. The averments in the body of the petition clearly showed that the petitioners were assailing the Order of April 27, 1959 (which denied their appeal), and a copy of this order was actually attached as Annex A [7, 8].

The petition satisfied Rule 67 (Certiorari), which only requires the petition to be verified, allege facts with certainty, and pray for annulment [9]. Even assuming Section 2 of Rule 49 applied, there was substantial compliance because the vital order (April 27, 1959) was attached [9]. Furthermore, the subsequent submission of other documents (e.g., Petition for Relief) in the motion for reconsideration cured the alleged technical defects [10]. Citing *Concepcion v. Payatas Estate Co.*, the Court reiterated that pleadings and remedial laws should be construed liberally to avoid the denial of substantial justice due to legal technicalities [10].

The Order of Dismissal was reversed and the case remanded to the respondent Court for further proceedings [11].
