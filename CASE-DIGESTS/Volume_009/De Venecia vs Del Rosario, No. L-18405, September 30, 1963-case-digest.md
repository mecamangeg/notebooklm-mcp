**I. CAPTION**
**URBANO DE VENECIA, ET AL. v. AQUILINO DEL ROSARIO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18405, September 30, 1963, Regala, J.**

**II. FACTS**
In a collection suit, the parties entered into a compromise agreement approved by the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan on December 12, 1959 [1, 2]. The defendants admitted an indebtedness of P6,475.26 and agreed to pay it in installments [1]. To secure the obligation, the defendants ceded three specific parcels of land as security [3]. The agreement provided that failure to pay would make the remaining balance immediately due and executable [4].

The defendants paid the first two installments but failed to pay the balance [2]. Consequently, the trial court issued an alias writ of execution commanding the sheriff to satisfy the debt out of the three parcels of land given as security [2]. The writ further directed that if said properties were insufficient or could not be found, the sheriff should levy on "other goods and chattels" of the defendants [2]. The defendants moved to quash the writ, arguing it varied the judgment because the compromise agreement limited liability to the three parcels of land. They cited Section 34, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court regarding unsatisfied executions [5, 6]. The lower court denied the motion, prompting this appeal [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the writ of execution varies the terms of the judgment by authorizing a levy on other properties if the security proves insufficient.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the writ of execution does not vary the decision sought to be executed. While the compromise agreement specified three parcels of land as security, the judgment approving it did not state or limit that *only* those properties would be liable, nor did it exempt other properties if the security proved insufficient [7, 8].

The Court further ruled that Section 34, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (regarding examination of judgment debtors) applies only to situations where the debtor conceals properties to prevent execution, which was not the case here [8, 9]. The writ substantially conforms with the judgment, provided that execution is directed *first* against the three parcels of land before levying on other properties [10].

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [10].
