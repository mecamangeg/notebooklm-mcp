I. CAPTION
ASUNCION CONUI-OMEGA v. CESAR SAMSON, G.R. No. L-21910, November 11, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Conui-Omega and Respondent Samson were candidates for city councilor in Ormoc City in the November 10, 1959 elections. The initial canvass showed Samson winning the eighth and final councilor seat by three votes. Conui-Omega filed for a recount, but the Supreme Court halted this in a separate certiorari proceeding. On December 29, 1959, the Board of Canvassers made a "partial proclamation" of the first seven councilors, leaving the contested eighth seat unproclaimed. On June 2, 1960, after the certiorari case was resolved, Samson was proclaimed as the eighth councilor.

On June 14, 1960, Conui-Omega filed an election protest. Samson moved to dismiss, arguing the protest was filed beyond the two-week mandatory period counting from the December 29 proclamation. Additionally, Samson failed to file an answer within the five-day statutory period, relying on the summons issued by the Clerk of Court which erroneously gave him 15 days (the period for civil cases). The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, entered a general denial for Samson, and eventually declared Conui-Omega the winner. Samson appealed, questioning the court's jurisdiction and the appreciation of ballots.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the election protest was filed within the mandatory two-week reglementary period.
2. W/N the protestee was correctly deemed to have entered a general denial for failure to answer within five days.
3. W/N ballots containing only the candidate's nickname are valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the two-week period to file an election protest under Section 174 of the Revised Election Code should be counted from the second proclamation on June 2, 1960, not the first partial proclamation on December 29, 1959. The first proclamation was merely partial and did not include the contested eighth seat. To count the period from the first proclamation would make the protest illusory, as Conui-Omega could not have protested before her opponent was proclaimed [1-3].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the five-day period to answer an election protest is specific and mandatory under the Election Law. The error of the Clerk of Court in using a standard civil case summons (stating 15 days) cannot prevail over the specific provision of the law. Since Samson failed to answer within five days, the trial court correctly deemed a general denial entered [4-6].

3. **NO.** While the lower court accepted ballots with only the nickname "Conching" based on prior jurisprudence (*Abrea v. Lloren*), the Supreme Court reversed this, citing the newer doctrine in *Tajanlangit v. Cazeñas*. Under the Revised Election Code, certificates of candidacy cannot contain nicknames; thus, a vote using a nickname alone, unaccompanied by the name or surname, is invalid and cannot be counted [7].

**Decision modified.** Asuncion Conui-Omega is declared the winner with a plurality of 10 votes over Cesar Samson.
