I. CAPTION
LUI LIN v. JAINUDIN NUÑO, G.R. No. L-18213, December 24, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On November 15, 1960, Lui Lin filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zamboanga City against the Local Civil Registrar to correct entries in the birth certificates of his children. Specifically, he sought to change the father's name from "Lui Bian Thong" (his alias) to "Lui Lin" (his name in immigration certificates) and to change his daughter's name from "Benita Lui" to "Ana Benita Lui" to reflect her baptismal name. The CFI granted the petition. The Republic of the Philippines appealed, arguing that the changes sought were not merely clerical and thus could not be authorized under Article 412 of the New Civil Code [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the corrections of the father's name from an alias to his real name and the child's name to her baptismal name are mere clerical errors correctable under Article 412 of the New Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that Article 412 of the New Civil Code contemplates only the correction of mistakes that are clerical in nature, such as misspelled names or occupations, and not those which may affect the civil status, nationality, or citizenship of the persons involved [4].

The Court found that the name "Lui Bian Thong" entered in the civil registry was an admitted alias and not a mistake; thus, changing it to "Lui Lin" is a substantial alteration that affects the status of the petitioner and the paternity and filiation of his children [5]. Similarly, the addition of "Ana" to the child's name is not a clerical error but one affecting filiation [6]. Such substantial changes must be threshed out in a proper action involving all concerned parties, not in a summary proceeding under Article 412. The appealed decision was **REVERSED** [6].
