I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF WONG KIT KENG TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, WONG KIT KENG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18898, December 24, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Wong Kit Keng filed a petition for naturalization before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zamboanga City [1, 2]. During the trial, he correctly answered questions propounded by his counsel regarding the Bill of Rights [3]. However, when questioned by the City Attorney and the Judge regarding other constitutional provisions—such as the power to declare war and impeachment—his answers were incorrect [2]. Additionally, when asked to write a statement about the Constitution and translate it into Chavacano, the principal dialect he claimed to command, he admitted he could not write in said dialect [4]. The CFI dismissed the petition for failure to prove adequate knowledge of the principles underlying the Constitution and the ability to read and write a Filipino dialect [2, 5]. Petitioner appealed, arguing the lower court erred in its appraisal of his knowledge [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner possesses the necessary qualifications for naturalization regarding knowledge of the Constitution and a native dialect.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision [7]. The Court reasoned that the discrepancy between the petitioner's correct answers to his lawyer and his incorrect answers to the Judge and City Attorney suggested he was merely trained to answer specific questions but lacked actual adequate knowledge [3, 6]. Furthermore, he expressly failed the test to write in Chavacano [4]. The Court upheld the principle that the trial judge's appraisal of a petitioner's knowledge is *prima facie* correct, as the judge had the unique opportunity to observe the petitioner's demeanor, hesitation, and manner of answering—factors not captured in the written record [8]. Consequently, Wong Kit Keng failed to meet the qualifications required by the Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473) [5]. The decision of the lower court was affirmed [7].
