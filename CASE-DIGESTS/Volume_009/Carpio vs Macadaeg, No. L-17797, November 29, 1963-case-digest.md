**I. CAPTION**
ISABELO CARPIO v. HON. HIGINIO MACADAEG and OSCAR C. ABAYA, G.R. No. L-17797, November 29, 1963, Makalintal, J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Oscar Abaya filed a complaint against Petitioner Isabelo Carpio for the recovery of money. Before summons was served, Abaya filed an *ex parte* motion for preliminary attachment, alleging that Carpio was about to dispose of his property to defraud creditors [3, 4]. Respondent Judge Macadaeg issued the writ, resulting in the garnishment of Carpio's imported goods and the seizure of five race horses [3].

Carpio moved to discharge the attachment, denying the fraud allegations. The Judge initially set aside the attachment orders but later reversed himself and reinstated the attachment upon Abaya’s motion for reconsideration, which cited Carpio's alleged sale of horses and furniture as proof of fraud [5, 6]. Carpio controverted these allegations, but the Judge reinstated the attachment without conducting a hearing to verify the claim of fraud [6, 7]. The Judge subsequently ordered the sale of the attached horses and goods, prompting Carpio to file a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court [2, 8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the writ of preliminary attachment. [9]

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that the issuance of the writ was improper and declared the orders null and void [10].

First, the mere removal or disposal of property is not a sufficient ground for the issuance of preliminary attachment; pursuant to Sec. 1(e), Rule 59 of the Rules of Court, such removal or disposal must be made with the specific intent to defraud creditors [4].

Second, when the allegation of fraudulent disposal was controverted by the petitioner, the Judge should have granted the parties an opportunity to prove their respective claims in a hearing before issuing the writ [7]. Citing *National Coconut Corporation v. Pecson* and *Villongco v. Panlilio*, the Court emphasized that the petitioner should have been given the chance to show that he was not disposing of his property in fraud of creditors [7, 11].

Third, the affidavit submitted by Abaya in support of his motion was insufficient under Sec. 3, Rule 59 of the Rules of Court, as it failed to establish that a sufficient cause of action existed or that the case was one of those where attachment is allowed [12, 13].

**Petition GRANTED.** The orders of the respondent Judge were declared null and void, the attached properties were ordered released, and the preliminary injunction issued by the Supreme Court was made permanent [10].
