I. CAPTION
FLORENCIO DEUDOR, et al. v. J. M. TUASON & CO., INC. and GREGORIO ARANETA, INC., G.R. No. L-20105, October 31, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
The plaintiffs (Deudors) claimed ownership over a 50-quiñone parcel of land in Quezon City. In previous civil cases filed in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal (Quezon City Branch), the parties entered into a Compromise Agreement on March 16, 1953. Under this agreement, the Deudors recognized the defendants' (Tuasons) title over the land and agreed to deliver possession, while the Tuasons agreed to pay the Deudors P1,201,063.00. The Deudors received P100,000.00 and delivered 20 quiñones but failed to deliver the balance of 30 quiñones. Consequently, the Tuasons refused to make further payments. In a prior decision (G.R. No. L-13768), the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's orders rescinding the Tuasons' obligation to pay due to the Deudors' failure to deliver possession.

On February 16, 1962, the Deudors filed the present complaint in the CFI of Manila seeking to annul the Compromise Agreement on grounds of fraud and mistake, or to rescind it for non-payment, and prayed for the return of the ownership and possession of the 20 quiñones of land they had delivered. The defendants moved to dismiss on grounds of improper venue and bar by prior judgment. The CFI of Manila dismissed the complaint.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N venue was properly laid in the CFI of Manila.
2. W/N the action is barred by prior judgment (res judicata).

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that venue was improperly laid. Although the plaintiffs characterized the action as one for rescission of contract, their complaint specifically prayed that the defendants be ordered "to return and give back to herein plaintiffs the ownership and possession" of the land. This makes it a real action affecting title to or possession of real property. Pursuant to Section 3, Rule 5 of the Rules of Court, real actions must be commenced and tried in the province where the property or any part thereof lies. Since the disputed property is located in Quezon City (within the province of Rizal), the action should have been instituted in the CFI of Rizal, not Manila [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the plaintiffs are barred from questioning the validity of the Compromise Agreement. For a period of five years following the agreement, the plaintiffs not only failed to assail its legality but actively induced the court to enforce it, accepting payments and seeking its implementation. The validity of the agreement was necessarily involved in the previous proceedings (G.R. No. L-13768), where the Court declared the defendants released from their obligation to pay due to the plaintiffs' breach. The final decision and orders in the previous case bar the plaintiffs from raising the same question in the present case [3].

The order appealed from is affirmed [4].
