I. CAPTION
DOMICIANO F. VALER vs. CELERINO O. BRIONES, G.R. No. L-20033, November 29, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Valer served as an *ad interim* member of the Board of Directors of the Abaca Corporation of the Philippines until his term expired in July 1961, after which he was designated as "acting member" on August 8, 1961 [1]. Valer claimed that on November 6, 1961, the former President issued him an *ad interim* appointment, but this was only released on December 29 or 30, 1961 [2]. On December 31, 1961, the new President issued Administrative Order No. 2, recalling all appointments released by his predecessor after December 13, 1961 [2]. Additionally, in January 1962, Valer expressly denied knowledge of or acceptance of said "midnight" appointment [3]. On June 22, 1962, the new Executive appointed Respondent Briones to the Board [1]. Valer filed an original action for *quo warranto* to oust Briones [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Valer's "midnight" *ad interim* appointment released on December 29, 1961 is valid.
2. W/N Valer's designation as "acting member" entitles him to security of tenure.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The appointment falls within the prohibition established in *Aytona vs. Castillo* [5], [2]. Since the *ad interim* appointment was released by the former Executive only on December 29, 1961—well after the December 13, 1961 cutoff set by the new administration's Administrative Order No. 2—it was validly recalled [2]. Furthermore, Petitioner had previously disavowed knowledge and acceptance of this specific appointment [3].

2. **NO.** A "designation" or appointment as an "acting" officer is essentially temporary and revocable at the pleasure of the appointing power [3]. The subsequent *ad interim* appointment of Respondent Briones manifested the revocation of Petitioner's acting designation [6].

The petition is dismissed and the writ prayed for denied [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes (J.B.L.), Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred. Justice Barrera concurred in the result [7].
