I. CAPTION
HON. MARTINIANO P. VIVO, as Commissioner of Immigration v. HON. FRANCISCO ARCA, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, et al., G.R. No. L-21728, December 27, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Chua Giok King and her three minor children arrived in the Philippines on June 25, 1960, as temporary visitors to visit their husband/father, Lim Chiao Cun, a Chinese resident with a pending naturalization case. After several extensions, the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and Justice approved a "change in category" to special non-immigrants and extended their stay up to June 9, 1963. This extension was conditioned on securing reentry permits to Hong Kong.

In 1962, a new administration ruled that the power to extend stays belonged solely to the Commissioner of Immigration (Petitioner) and issued a circular abrogating previous extensions. The respondents filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, presided by Respondent Judge Arca, and obtained a preliminary injunction against their expulsion. On June 26, 1963, after the June 9 expiration date had passed, the Commissioner moved to lift the injunction. Judge Arca refused to dissolve it. The Commissioner filed this petition for certiorari. [1-7]

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to dissolve the preliminary injunction after the aliens' extended period of stay had expired. [7]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the refusal to dissolve the injunction was against the law and constituted abuse of discretion.

The Court held that even assuming the extension granted by the Secretaries of Justice and Foreign Affairs was valid, it expressly limited the respondents' stay only "up to June 9, 1963." The indorsements did not effect a change of status to permanent residence pending the husband's naturalization because the extension was for a fixed date and required reentry permits, which is incompatible with an indefinite stay [8-10].

An extension of an alien's stay is a matter of grace, not right, and must be strictly interpreted [11, 12]. Since the authorized period expired on June 9, 1963, without further prolongation by competent authority, the aliens were subject to expulsion. The refusal of the lower court to dissolve the injunction after this date was in excess of jurisdiction [12].

The Petition was granted; the preliminary injunction and the order of the respondent judge were annulled and set aside [13].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred. [14]
