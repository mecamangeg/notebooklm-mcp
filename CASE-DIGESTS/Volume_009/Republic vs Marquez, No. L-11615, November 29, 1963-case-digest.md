I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. TOMAS MARQUEZ, G.R. No. L-11615, November 29, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant Tomas Marquez filed an application for a homestead patent for two parcels of public land in Isabela. After filing, he entered into a verbal agreement with Juan Acupido and Fernando Aguinaldo, wherein the latter two would clear and cultivate parts of the land and share in the expenses; in return, Marquez promised to convey to them the portions they worked on. Marquez stated under oath in his application that the land was for his "exclusive personal use and benefit."

Homestead patents were issued to Marquez on December 15, 1936, followed by the issuance of Original Certificates of Title. On July 16, 1947, pursuant to their earlier agreement, Marquez executed an instrument conveying the specific portions of the land to Acupido and Aguinaldo.

On April 12, 1949, the Republic filed a complaint for the annulment of the patents and reversion of the land to the State. The Republic alleged that Marquez violated the Public Land Act (Commonwealth Act No. 141) by falsely stating the land was for his exclusive benefit and by alienating the land. The Court of First Instance of Isabela dismissed the complaint.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Marquez violated the Public Land Act provisions regarding exclusive benefit and the prohibition against alienation, thereby justifying the cancellation of his patent.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal.

First, regarding the allegation of fraud or falsehood in the application (Section 90, C.A. No. 141), the Court held that Marquez did not state a falsehood when he applied for the homestead. The agreement to convey was executed only after the patents were issued, and his initial oath regarding exclusive use was not negated by the subsequent conditional verbal agreement to share the land with those who helped clear it.

Second, regarding the prohibition against alienation, the Court ruled that there was no violation because the deed of conveyance was executed on July 16, 1947, which was more than ten (10) years after the homestead patents were issued on December 15, 1936. The prohibition against alienation or encumbrance of homesteads applies only for a specific statutory period (typically 5 years), which had long lapsed in this case. The Court even commended Marquez's honesty in living up to his promise to his co-tenants.

The judgment appealed from is affirmed.
