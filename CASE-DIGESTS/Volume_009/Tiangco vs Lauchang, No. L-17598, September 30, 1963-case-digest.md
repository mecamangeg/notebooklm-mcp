I. CAPTION
**JACINTO TIANGCO and JOSE LAZARO v. FAUSTINA LAUCHANG** (consolidated with **ASUNCION HIZON v. FAUSTINA LAUCHANG**), G.R. Nos. L-17598 and L-17694, September 30, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
The subject property is Lot No. 10, Block 2 of the Tambobong Estate in Malabon, Rizal, containing 480 square meters [1]. Originally leased by the Archbishop of Manila to Matea Suarez, the leasehold interest was sold in 1906 to Anacleto Lauchang, the father of respondent Faustina Lauchang [1]. Upon Anacleto's death in 1923, Faustina took over the lease and paid rents until the government acquired the estate under Commonwealth Act (C.A.) No. 539 [1, 2].

Petitioners Asuncion Hizon, Jacinto Tiangco, and Jose Lazaro occupied specific portions of the lot (82, 91, and 113 square meters, respectively) for roughly 20 years [3]. The Court of Appeals found that the petitioners were merely sublessees of Faustina, who was the *bona fide* tenant [4]. The Court of Appeals rendered an amended judgment declaring Faustina entitled to purchase the *entire* lot, reversing any awards to the petitioners [5, 6]. Petitioners appealed, arguing they should have preferential rights to the portions they occupied and that the respondent failed to exhaust administrative remedies [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent *bona fide* tenant has the preferential right to purchase the entire lot over the petitioner occupants under C.A. No. 539.
2. W/N the action should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the preferential right of the respondent. Section 1 of C.A. No. 539 establishes a strict order of preference for the resale of home lots: first to *bona fide* tenants, second to occupants, and last to private individuals [2]. Relying on *Santiago v. Cruz*, the Court held that the legislative intent is to award lots in the order mentioned [2]. The petitioners' claim that there were "compelling reasons" to depart from this rule was rejected. Unlike the lessee in *Gutierrez v. Santos* who already owned substantial property, the respondent here owned no other realty and the 480-square-meter lot was barely adequate for her large family [9]. In contrast, petitioners Tiangco and Lazaro were found to already own other lots in the same municipality [9].

2. **NO.** The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is not a bar to this action. The Court reiterated that where the land involved is not part of the public domain but is private property acquired by the government for resale to private persons, an aggrieved party may file an action directly in court without exhausting administrative remedies [10].

The amended decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED** [11].
