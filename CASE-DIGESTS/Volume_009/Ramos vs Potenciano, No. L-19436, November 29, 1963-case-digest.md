I. CAPTION
CELESTINA B. RAMOS, ET AL. v. LAUREANO POTENCIANO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19436, November 29, 1963, 9 SCRA 389, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Laureano and Esperanza Potenciano, with the Land Tenure Administration, filed an ejectment suit against Celestina B. Ramos, et al. (petitioners) regarding a parcel of land in Manila. On June 18, 1960, the Court of First Instance rendered a decision ordering petitioners to vacate. Petitioners filed a motion for new trial.

Pending the motion, "Attys. Endaya, Cabasal & Holgado" entered their appearance as counsel for petitioners in substitution of the attorneys of record, Attys. Deogracias G. Trinidad and Prospero A. Crescini. Subsequently, the court issued an order dated October 24, 1961, denying the motion for new trial. Copies of this order were served on the original counsel, Attys. Trinidad and Crescini, but not on the new counsel.

Respondents moved for execution, arguing the decision had become final. Petitioners opposed, claiming they were never legally served with the order denying the new trial because service was made to the old lawyers. The court granted the execution. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, alleging grave abuse of discretion.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the service of the order denying the motion for new trial upon the original counsel was valid despite the appearance of new counsel.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the service upon the original counsel was valid because the substitution of attorneys was defective.

For a valid substitution of attorneys, the following must be filed: (1) a written application for substitution; (2) the written consent of the client; and (3) the written consent of the attorney to be substituted. If the consent of the attorney to be substituted cannot be obtained, there must be proof that notice of the motion for substitution has been served upon him in the manner prescribed by the rules.

In this case, while the substitution had the clients' consent, the petitioners failed to notify the original attorneys (Trinidad and Crescini), nor did they obtain their consent. Consequently, the original lawyers remained the attorneys of record entitled to receive notices and pleadings. The Court applied the rule laid down in *United States v. Borromeo*, stating that unless the required formalities are complied with, the attorney who properly appeared last in the cause will be regarded as the attorney of record. The client is answerable for the shortcomings of their counsel.

Petition denied.
