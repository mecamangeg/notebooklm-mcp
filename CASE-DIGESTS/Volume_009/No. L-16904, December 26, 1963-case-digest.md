I. CAPTION
BANK OF AMERICA (Manila Branch) v. THE HON. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and PHILIPPINE FEDERATION OF LABOR, G.R. No. L-16904, December 26, 1963, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On May 30, 1959, the Philippine Federation of Labor filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) on behalf of five members employed as security guards by Bank of America (Bank) [1]. The petition sought payment for unpaid overtime work rendered on Sundays and legal holidays from 1947 to the date of filing [1]. It also alleged that the Bank refused to hold a conference regarding these grievances and other unfair labor practices [1].

The Bank moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that under Republic Act No. 875, the CIR lacked jurisdiction over money claims [2]. The trial judge granted the motion and dismissed the petition on September 10, 1959 [3]. However, upon the Federation's motion for reconsideration, the CIR *en banc* issued an order on March 12, 1960, setting aside the dismissal and asserting its jurisdiction to hear the case [4, 5]. The Bank appealed this order to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over claims for unpaid overtime wages rendered on Sundays and legal holidays when the claimants are still employed by the company.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's jurisdiction. The Court reasoned that a claim for unpaid wages for services actually rendered on Sundays and legal holidays constitutes a grievance [5]. Since the claimants continued in the employ of the Bank, such a grievance could lead to a strike [5]. Consequently, the CIR possesses the jurisdiction to hear and decide the dispute to prevent such industrial conflict [5].

The order of the CIR *en banc* was affirmed [6].
