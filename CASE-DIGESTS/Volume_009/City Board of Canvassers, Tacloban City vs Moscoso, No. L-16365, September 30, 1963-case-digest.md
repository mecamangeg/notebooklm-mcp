I. CAPTION
THE CITY BOARD OF CANVASSERS, TACLOBAN CITY, MAYOR ARTEMIO MATE, et al. v. THE HON. SEGUNDO MOSCOSO, JUDGE, COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF LEYTE, JOSE HIDALGO, et al., G.R. No. L-16365, September 30, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Following the November 10, 1959 elections, the City Treasurer of Tacloban convened the City Board of Canvassers (BOC) to canvass votes and proclaim city officials [1]. Respondent Jose Hidalgo, a candidate for city councilor, filed a petition for injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte against the BOC [1]. Hidalgo alleged that the City Treasurer lacked authority to convene the board, that the board members were disqualified, and that the elections were marred by terrorism and vote-buying [1].

Respondent Judge Moscoso issued a preliminary injunction restraining the BOC from canvassing the votes and proclaiming the winners [2]. Hidalgo later amended his petition to request that the elections be declared null and void due to the alleged irregularities [2]. The BOC moved to dissolve the injunction, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction, but the Judge sustained his jurisdiction and issued an amended writ [3]. The BOC filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court to annul the Judge's orders [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance may enjoin the City Board of Canvassers from canvassing returns and proclaiming winning candidates based on allegations of terrorism and election irregularities.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that questions of terrorism, vote-buying, and other irregularities should be ventilated in a regular election protest pursuant to **Section 174 of the Election Code**, and not in a petition to enjoin the board from performing its duties [5].

The duty of the BOC to canvass returns and proclaim winners is ministerial and does not involve passing upon the validity of ballots [5]. An election protest contest is proper only *after* the proclamation of results [5]. To enjoin the canvass would result in a vacuum of leadership (lack of incumbents) after the current terms expire [5]. Furthermore, such an injunction prevents the certification of results for national offices (e.g., Senators), over which the Senate Electoral Tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction [6].

Regarding the other grounds, the Court found the City Treasurer was authorized by a COMELEC resolution [7], and the substitute board members were validly designated under **Section 159 of the Election Code** [8].

The petition is **GRANTED** and the preliminary injunction issued by the Supreme Court against respondent Judge is made permanent [6].
