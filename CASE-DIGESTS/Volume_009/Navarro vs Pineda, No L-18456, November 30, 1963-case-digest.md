I. CAPTION
CONRADO P. NAVARRO v. RUFINO G. PINEDA, RAMONA REYES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18456, November 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On December 14, 1959, defendants Rufino Pineda and his mother, Juana Gonzales, borrowed P2,550.00 from plaintiff Conrado Navarro. To secure the loan, they executed a "Deed of Real Estate and Chattel Mortgages." Juana mortgaged her land, while Rufino mortgaged his two-story residential house and a motor truck. Rufino’s house was constructed on land belonging to a third person, Atty. Vicente Castro, and was constructed of mixed materials (sawali, wood, and G.I. roofing). The deed expressly referred to the house and truck as Rufino's "personal properties" conveyed by way of "Chattel Mortgage."

When the defendants failed to pay the loan upon maturity and after two extensions, Navarro filed a complaint for foreclosure. The Court of First Instance of Tarlac rendered judgment ordering the defendants to pay the principal plus interest and damages, or else the mortgaged properties would be sold. The defendants appealed directly to the Supreme Court, arguing that the deed of chattel mortgage was null and void because the house, being an immovable property under Article 415 of the Civil Code, could not be the subject of a chattel mortgage.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a residential house standing on rented land belonging to another may be the subject of a valid chattel mortgage between the contracting parties.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that where a house stands on rented land belonging to another person, it may be the subject-matter of a chattel mortgage as personal or movable property if so stipulated in the document of mortgage. In an action by the mortgagee for foreclosure, the validity of the chattel mortgage cannot be assailed by one of the parties to the contract based on the principle of **estoppel**.

The Court reasoned that the parties expressly agreed to treat the house as personal property. The deed grouped the house with the truck (an inherent movable) under the caption "personal properties." Furthermore, the house was small, made of light mixed materials, and stood on rented land. While the general rule is that a building is immovable, the parties to a contract may, by agreement, treat as personal property that which by nature would be real property (citing *Standard Oil Co. of N.Y. v. Jaranillo*). This view is valid insofar as the contracting parties are concerned (*Evangelista v. Alto Surety*), even if it may not be binding on third persons. Since the validity was assailed by the mortgagor himself, and not a third party, he is estopped from claiming otherwise.

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
