I. CAPTION
DY KIM LIONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18608, December 26, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On July 25, 1960, Dy Kim Liong filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to correct the local civil registry. He sought to change his son’s name on the birth certificate from "Raynaldo Chan" to "Raynaldo Dy" and the father's name from "Jose Chan" to "Dy Kim Liong." On May 21, 1961, the CFI rendered a decision denying the main petition for correction. However, the trial court directed the Local Civil Registrar to receive, register, and attach to the child's birth certificate a certified true copy of the Bureau of Immigration record showing the petitioner’s name as "Dy Kim Liong," citing Sections 10, 11, and 12 of the Civil Register Act (Act No. 3753). The Republic moved to reconsider this specific directive, arguing it was unauthorized. When the motion was denied, the Republic appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Local Civil Registrar can be compelled to register and attach a Bureau of Immigration record to a birth certificate under Section 12 of the Civil Register Act No. 3753.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that a certified copy of a Bureau of Immigration record is not a "registrable" document within the purview of Section 12(a) of Act No. 3753. The Court explained that the word "registrable" in Section 12(a) refers specifically to certificates and documents related to decrees issued by courts in proper proceedings—such as adoption, change of name, naturalization, legitimation, and acknowledgment—as enumerated in Sections 10 and 11 of the Act.

Since the lower court properly dismissed the main petition for the correction of the name in the registry as improper, granting the additional relief of attaching the immigration record would result in a virtual circumvention of the law. The Court emphasized that allowing such registration would be a "whimsical or arbitrary interpretation" of the statute.

The decision of the lower court is **MODIFIED** by deleting the portion which authorizes the registration and attachment to the birth certificate of the child Raynaldo of a certified true copy of the record of the Bureau of Immigration.
