I. CAPTION
**IN RE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ESTATE OF PASCUAL VILLANUEVA, MAURICIA G. DE VILLANUEVA v. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK**, G.R. No. L-18403, September 30, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On December 19, 1949, Mauricia G. de Villanueva filed a petition for letters of administration for the estate of her deceased husband, Pascual Villanueva, with the Court of First Instance of Agusan [1]. The Notice to Creditors was issued on November 9, 1950, requiring claims to be filed within six to twelve months from the first publication [2]. This notice was published in the *Morning Times* of Cebu City on November 16, 23, and 30, 1950, and the filing period expired on November 16, 1951 [3].

On July 20, 1953, the Philippine National Bank (PNB) filed a creditor's claim for P1,347.45, an obligation due since December 20, 1940 [3], [4]. The administrator opposed the claim, arguing it was barred by the statute of limitations and the expiration of the filing period [5], [6]. PNB subsequently filed a petition for an extension of time under Section 2, Rule 87, claiming it lacked knowledge of the proceedings due to the newspaper's limited circulation [6], [7]. The lower court denied the petition, ruling that the claim was barred by prescription and that PNB failed to show a justifiable reason for the late filing [8]. The court noted that PNB's Agusan Agency had actual knowledge of the proceedings, as the administrator had deposited estate funds there in June 1951 [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the court should grant an extension of time for PNB to file its claim after the prescribed period has elapsed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that while courts may extend the period for filing claims even after the limited period has elapsed, such extensions should only be granted under "special circumstances" [10], [11].

In this case, the Court found no justifiable reason to grant the extension. Despite PNB's claim of lack of notice, the petition was duly published [10]. Furthermore, PNB's Agusan Agency had actual knowledge of the settlement proceedings because the administrator had deposited war damage payments belonging to the estate with that specific branch in June 1951 [12], [9]. Consequently, PNB's failure to present its claim on time was due to its own fault and did not constitute excusable negligence [8]. The Court affirmed the lower court's finding that there was no valid ground for an extension [11].

The order of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred [13]. Justices Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, and Barrera took no part [13].
