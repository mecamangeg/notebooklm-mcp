I. CAPTION
REMIGIO GABUYA v. EUSTAQUIO M. DAYAO, G.R. No. L-20235, September 30, 1963, Barrera, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
In the November 10, 1959 elections for Mayor of Dimiao, Bohol, Remigio Gabuya was proclaimed elected over Eutiquio Dajao (Dayao). [2] Dajao filed a protest in the Court of First Instance of Bohol, which upheld Gabuya's election with 773 votes against Dajao's 637. [2] Dajao appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which reversed the lower court's decision and declared Dajao the winner by a plurality of 38 votes. [2] The CA invalidated 170 of Gabuya's ballots as "marked" because they followed a specific pattern: the name of the first councilor voted for was written with a surname prefixed by a nickname or contraction (e.g., "Dan" Calihat, "Mat" Acusar), while the other candidates were voted for by surname or initial and surname only. [2] The CA found this pattern was supported by *evidence aliunde*, specifically that sample ballots with this design were distributed by Gabuya's leaders with instructions to use them as countersigns. [3] Gabuya petitioned the Supreme Court for review, questioning the classification of these votes as marked ballots. [2]

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the 170 ballots containing nicknames prefixed to the first councilor's name were correctly invalidated as marked ballots. [2]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. [4] The Court held that the determinative factor in nullifying ballots for being marked as following a design or pattern is the existence of *evidence aliunde* tending to show the intention or purpose to identify the ballots. [5] In this case, the Court of Appeals correctly considered not only the common pattern found in the 170 ballots but also the *evidence aliunde* presented by the respondent, which established that sample ballots containing these specific countersigns were distributed to voters with instructions to follow them. [3, 4] This evidence proved the manner of voting was planned to identify the votes of certain voters or groups. [4]

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. [4]
