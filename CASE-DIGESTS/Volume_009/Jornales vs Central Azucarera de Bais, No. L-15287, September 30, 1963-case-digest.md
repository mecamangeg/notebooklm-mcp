I. CAPTION
VIVENCIO JORNALES, et al. v. CENTRAL AZUCARERA DE BAIS and COMPAÑIA CELULOSA DE FILIPINAS, G.R. No. L-15287, September 30, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Vivencio Jornales and other employees filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Oriental against their employers, Central Azucarera de Bais and Compañia Celulosa de Filipinas, seeking reinstatement and damages for alleged illegal dismissal [1]. The complaint, termed as one for "specific performance," alleged that the defendants violated their employment agreements [2]. However, the annexes attached to the complaint revealed that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs because they failed to join the United Central and Cellulose Labor Association (UCCLA-PLUM) as required by a "closed-shop" clause in the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement [3-5]. The CFI dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, reasoning that the claim for reinstatement was closely interwoven with a question of unfair labor practice [2]. Plaintiffs appealed, insisting the CFI had jurisdiction over the enforcement of their employment contracts [2, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over a complaint for reinstatement where the dismissal is based on non-compliance with a closed-shop agreement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. The Court ruled that while a simple unjustified dismissal is a breach of contract cognizable by the Court of First Instance, the facts alleged in this case constitute an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) [6]. The complaint and its annexes effectively averred that the plaintiffs were dismissed for failing to join a labor union, which falls under the definition of discrimination in regard to tenure of employment to encourage union membership [7]. Under Section 5(a) of R.A. 875 (Industrial Peace Act), jurisdiction over the prevention of unfair labor practices is exclusively vested in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [7]. Since the claim for reinstatement was "closely interwoven" with the question of ULP, the case involved a violation of a public right specially protected by law, which must be prosecuted in the Industrial Court rather than the CFI [6, 8]. The CFI correctly dismissed the case *ex mero motu* (on its own motion) because lack of subject matter jurisdiction is fatal and may be raised at any stage [9, 10].

Order affirmed [9].
