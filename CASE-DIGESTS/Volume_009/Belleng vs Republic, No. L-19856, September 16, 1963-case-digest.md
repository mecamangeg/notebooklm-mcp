**I. CAPTION**
KINDIPAN BELLENG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES (CITY ENGINEER OF BAGUIO), G.R. No. L-19856, September 16, 1963, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Kindipan Belleng, a laborer for the Office of the City Engineer of Baguio for over 30 years, suffered a snake bite resulting in the amputation of his leg [1]. On January 3, 1962, the Workmen’s Compensation Commission awarded him P3,088.27 [1]. When the City Engineer failed to pay, Belleng filed a petition with the CFI of Baguio to enforce the award [2, 3]. The CFI initially rendered judgment and issued a writ of execution [3]. However, upon motion by the Solicitor General, the CFI quashed the execution on March 29, 1962, ruling that the State's immunity from suit was not waived insofar as the issuance of execution is concerned [3, 4]. Belleng appealed, arguing that the Workmen's Compensation Act impliedly repealed the prohibition against execution found in Act 3083 [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a writ of execution may be issued against the Government to enforce a final award under the Workmen's Compensation Act.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that in consenting to be sued under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, the Government did not waive the condition prescribed by Section 7 of Act 3083, which explicitly provides that "no execution shall issue upon any judgment rendered by any court against the Government" [5]. The State allows itself to be sued in compensation cases, but limits the claimant’s action only up to the completion of proceedings anterior to the stage of execution [6, 7].

The Court ruled that the proper remedy lies in Section 53 of the Compensation Act (Act 3428) [8, 9]. If the government employer contributed to the compensation guarantee fund and there is an available balance, the Commissioner may authorize disbursement [9, 10]. Otherwise, the claimant must file a claim with the Auditor General [9, 10].

The appealed order quashing the writ of execution is **AFFIRMED** [11].
