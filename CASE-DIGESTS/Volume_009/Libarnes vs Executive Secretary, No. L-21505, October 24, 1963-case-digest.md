I. CAPTION
LUCIO C. LIBARNES v. THE HON. EXECUTIVE SECRETARY AND/OR HIS ASSISTANTS, MAYOR TOMAS FERRER OF ZAMBOANGA CITY and MAJOR MIGUEL APOSTOL, G.R. No. L-21505, October 24, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lucio C. Libarnes was appointed Chief of Police of Zamboanga City by the President, confirmed by the Commission on Appointments, and assumed office on March 11, 1959 [1]. On May 16, 1963, the Executive Secretary designated respondent Major Miguel Apostol as Acting Chief of Police [1]. Subsequently, Zamboanga City Mayor Tomas Ferrer informed Libarnes that the President had terminated his services "effective immediately" pursuant to Section 34 of the Zamboanga City Charter (Commonwealth Act No. 39), which authorized the President to remove the Chief of Police "at pleasure" [1, 2]. Libarnes refused to turn over the office and filed an original petition for *quo warranto* and injunction with the Supreme Court, arguing that under Section 5 of Republic Act No. 2259 and the Civil Service Law (R.A. No. 2260), he could only be removed for cause and after due process [3]. Respondents maintained that the City Charter provision allowing removal at pleasure was still valid [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the President may remove the Chief of Police of Zamboanga City at pleasure pursuant to Section 34 of Commonwealth Act No. 39.
2. W/N Section 5 of Republic Act No. 2259, granting security of tenure to presidential appointees in chartered cities, is unconstitutional for being a rider (violating the "one subject, one title" rule).

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that Section 34 of Commonwealth Act No. 39, allowing removal at pleasure, was repealed by Section 5 of Republic Act No. 2259 [4]. R.A. No. 2259 expressly provides that "All other city officials now appointed by the President of the Philippines may not be removed from office except for cause" [4]. Furthermore, Section 9 of the same Act repeals all inconsistent acts [5]. As the Chief of Police is a member of the civil service system under R.A. No. 2260, he cannot be removed or suspended except for cause as provided by law and after due process [5]. The attempt to terminate his services without cause constituted an illegal removal [6]. The Court distinguished this from *Fernandez v. Ledesma*, noting that in the present case, the termination occurred after R.A. No. 2259 had already taken effect [7].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the provision in Section 5 of R.A. No. 2259 is not a rider and does not violate the constitutional requirement that a bill embrace only one subject expressed in its title [8, 9]. The condition under which local officials may be removed is germane to the purpose of the Act, which is to establish uniformity in the number, manner of choice, and powers of city officials [9]. Moreover, the provision was debated on the floor of Congress, ensuring legislators were aware of its existence, satisfying the constitutional intent as held in *Inchong v. Fernandez* [10, 11].

ACCORDINGLY, judgment is rendered declaring plaintiff Lucio C. Libarnes the *de jure* Chief of Police of Zamboanga City, entitled to continue holding said office, and enjoining defendants from interfering with his possession thereof [11].
