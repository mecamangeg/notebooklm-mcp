I. CAPTION
RAMON B. MELENDEZ v. TOMASA LAVARIAS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17724, November 29, 1963, Concepcion, J. [1]

II. FACTS
On September 27, 1944, respondents Tomasa Lavarias and Brigida Estrada executed deeds of "sale with right to repurchase" covering a lot in Binmaley, Pangasinan, in favor of Rodolfo Sajonas for P1,000.00 and P700.00, respectively, in Japanese currency [2]. Years later, on April 7, 1953, Sajonas executed a deed of absolute sale of the same lot to petitioner Ramon Melendez [2]. Melendez filed a complaint claiming ownership, alleging the respondents failed to redeem the property within the two-year period [2].

During trial, the parties stipulated that the amounts received in 1944 were merely loans in Japanese money and the deeds were executed as security (equitable mortgages) [3]. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan ruled that the Ballantyne scale applied because the debt could have been paid within the occupation period [4]. It ordered respondents to pay Melendez P180.00 (the adjusted value of the P1,700 Japanese currency debt) plus interest [4]. Melendez appealed, arguing that the respondents’ failure to pay within the stipulated period forfeited their right to use the Ballantyne scale [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the debtors lose the right to avail of the Ballantyne scale due to their default or delay in payment. [5]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the non-payment of an obligation within the stipulated period has no other effect than to give the creditor the right to sue for the recovery of the amount due, plus damages for the default [5]. It does not remove the debtor's right to avail of the benefits of the Ballantyne scale [5, 6]. The Court cited Articles 1170 and 1193 of the Civil Code regarding damages for default but maintained that the adjustment of the monetary obligation based on the time it was incurred remains applicable [5].

Additionally, the Court noted that the consideration paid by the petitioner (as a subsequent vendee) to the original creditor is no obstacle to applying the Ballantyne scale to the original obligation, particularly where the vendee knew the land belonged to the debtors and not the creditor [7, 8].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [9].
