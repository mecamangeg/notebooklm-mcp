I. CAPTION
THE BUTUAN LUMBER MANUFACTURING CO., INC., ET AL. v. HON. MONTANO ORTIZ, RAFAEL C. AQUINO and ZACARIAS AQUINO, G.R. No. L-15760, October 31, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Rafael Aquino and petitioner Butuan Lumber Manufacturing Co. were adjacent logging concessionaires in Agusan. A boundary dispute arose when a survey by a forest guard placed the boundary within Aquino's concession [1]. The Bureau of Forestry ordered a verification survey, which corrected the boundary in favor of Aquino on October 10, 1958 [1, 2]. Consequently, Aquino filed a petition for injunction and damages in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan to prevent Butuan Lumber from operating in the disputed area [3].

Butuan Lumber filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the petition lacked a cause of action and the court lacked jurisdiction because Butuan Lumber had appealed the Forestry Director's decision to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources [2, 3]. They contended that the administrative decision was not final and Aquino had not exhausted administrative remedies [2]. The CFI denied the motion to dismiss, ruling that Aquino's license defined the boundaries as final [4]. Butuan Lumber filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court to annul the CFI's order [3, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court had jurisdiction to entertain the injunction suit despite the pending administrative appeal by the petitioner.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the lower court had jurisdiction and did not abuse its discretion. The prosecution of the appeal by Butuan Lumber to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources did not, *per se*, operate to render the decision of the Bureau of Forestry in favor of Aquino inoperative [6, 7]. The Court reasoned that it was Butuan Lumber's right to the disputed area that had been denied by the Director of Forestry, not Aquino's; thus, Aquino had no administrative remedy to exhaust as the decision was already favorable to him [3, 7]. Under these circumstances, Aquino was entitled to the issuance of the writ to preserve his rights to the disputed area [6]. The appeal by Butuan Lumber did not have the effect of suspending such right [7].

Petition dismissed; writ of preliminary injunction dissolved [5, 8].
