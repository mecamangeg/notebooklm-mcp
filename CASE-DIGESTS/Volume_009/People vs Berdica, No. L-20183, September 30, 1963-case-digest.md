**I. CAPTION**
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. EDUARDO BERDICA Y INGUITO, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-20183, September 30, 1963, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
The case was forwarded to the Supreme Court for compulsory review after the lower court sentenced the defendants, including appellants Loreto Saberon and Jesus Felicia, to death [1]. On March 13, 1963, a notice to file the appellants' brief was sent by registered mail to their counsel, Atty. Agustin R. Homeres [1]. The return card was signed by one "S. Flores" on April 22, 1963 [1]. Due to the non-filing of the brief based on this service, the Court required Atty. Homeres to explain his failure and subsequently imposed a fine of P100.00 on him via a resolution dated June 27, 1963 [2, 3].

Meanwhile, a second notice was served through the Quezon City Chief of Police and was delivered to Atty. Homeres' wife on June 9, 1963 [2]. On July 8, 1963, Atty. Homeres filed a petition for extension of time, alleging he only received the notice served on June 9 [2]. He later explained that "S. Flores" was unknown to him, not a resident of his address, and unauthorized to receive mail on his behalf [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the fine imposed on the counsel for failure to file the brief should be upheld despite the alleged unauthorized service of the first notice.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the resolution imposing the fine [4]. The Court held that there was no conclusive proof in the record that "S. Flores," who received the first notice to file the brief, was duly authorized by Atty. Homeres [5]. Conversely, the record disclosed that a second notice was duly served on counsel through his wife on June 9, 1963 [5]. Before the expiration of the period from this valid service, Atty. Homeres filed the corresponding motion for extension, which the Court granted [5].

Accordingly, the fine was set aside, the appointment of a counsel *de officio* was revoked, and Atty. Homeres was granted a final period to file the brief [4].
