I. CAPTION
LUZON BROKERAGE COMPANY, petitioner, vs. LUZON LABOR UNION, respondent., G.R. No. L-17085, October 31, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Claimants, members of the respondent Union, alleged that the managers of petitioner Luzon Brokerage Company promised them two to three years of back pay for services rendered to the U.S. Army in Bataan following the outbreak of World War II in December 1941. The petitioner denied making such promises. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found the evidence regarding the promise contradictory and declared it was in a "state of doubt" as to whether the promise was actually made. Nevertheless, the CIR granted the back pay claim, ruling that it had to give the claimants the "benefit of the doubt." The petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, challenging the award's legal basis and the duration of the pay, and questioning awards for overtime and incidental expenses.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR correctly awarded back pay based on the "benefit of the doubt" despite the lack of a preponderance of evidence.
2. W/N the alleged promise of back pay covers the claimed 2-3 years.
3. W/N the claimants are entitled to overtime pay and incidental expenses.
4. W/N the second motion for reconsideration is barred by the rule on omnibus motions.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The CIR's grant of back pay based on "benefit of the doubt" has no foundation in law. As the claimants made the affirmative allegation that back pay was promised, they bore the burden of establishing the truth of such allegation by a **preponderance of evidence** [1], [2]. Since the lower court entertained a doubt and did not find the promise supported by a preponderance of evidence, the claim should have been denied [3], [4].

2. **NO.** Even assuming a promise was made, it cannot be interpreted to cover 2-3 years. At the start of the war, the prevalent belief was that hostilities would be short. The most sensible interpretation is that the promise covered only the period of actual hostilities in Bataan [5], [6], [4]. The Court modified the award to cover wages only from **December 8, 1941 to June 8, 1942** (allowing time for claimants to return to Manila after the surrender) [7].

3. **YES (Overtime) / NO (Expenses).** The claim for 16 hours of overtime pay per day is justified because, during the continuous hostilities in Bataan, the claimants—like soldiers—had to be on alert 24 hours a day [5], [8]. However, claims for "incidental expenses" are denied for lack of specification [8]. Furthermore, amounts received by claimants from the U.S. Army should *not* be deducted from their back pay, as they remained employees of the petitioner during that period [9], [10].

4. **NO.** The rule on omnibus motions applies only to motions for reconsideration that tend to delay the perfection of an appeal. It does not apply to motions addressed to the merits of the case or those seeking to make the judgment conformable to law and justice [11], [12], [13].

**Original decision modified.** Claims for back wages limited to the period from December 8, 1941 to June 8, 1942; incidental expenses denied.
