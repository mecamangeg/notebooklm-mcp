I. CAPTION
SURIGAO CONSOLIDATED MINING CO., INC. v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE and COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-14878, December 26, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Surigao Consolidated Mining Co. operated mining concessions in Surigao. Due to the outbreak of WWII, it lost contact with its mines and did not receive production reports for the fourth quarter of 1941. To avoid penalties, Petitioner deposited P27,000.00 with the City Treasurer of Iloilo on January 19, 1942, as an approximate payment for ad valorem taxes. After the war, pursuant to Commonwealth Act No. 722, Petitioner filed its tax returns for the said quarter and paid the remaining balance of the tax liability.

Subsequently, Petitioner filed statements of adjustment requesting a refund of P17,051.14. The claim covered: (1) taxes paid on minerals alleged to be lost in transit or looted during the war, invoking the condonation clause under Republic Act No. 81; and (2) alleged overpayment based on smelter returns showing a lower market value of minerals shipped to the US. The Collector of Internal Revenue denied the refund. The case was elevated to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), which also denied the claim for lack of merit.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the condonation of taxes under RA No. 81 extends to a refund of taxes already paid.
2. W/N Petitioner is entitled to a refund based on the alleged actual market value in the smelter returns.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that Section 1(d) of RA No. 81 clearly refers to the condonation of **unpaid** taxes only [1]. The condonation of a tax liability is equivalent to and is in the nature of a tax exemption [2]. Being so, it must be sustained only when expressed in explicit terms and cannot be extended beyond the plain meaning of those terms [2]. Statutes granting tax exemptions are strictly construed against the taxpayer [1]. Since the law does not explicitly provide for a refund of paid taxes, the benefit cannot extend to the Petitioner [3]. Furthermore, the Petitioner failed to present adequate evidence (relying on hearsay) to prove the actual loss or looting of minerals [3, 4].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the **smelter returns** are the best evidence of the actual market value of minerals shipped abroad [5]. Although admitted to be in Petitioner's possession, these returns were not produced during trial without explanation [6]. This gives rise to the presumption that if produced, they would be adverse to the Petitioner [5, 6]. In a suit for the recovery of taxes, the burden of proof is on the taxpayer to establish the facts showing the illegality of the tax [7, 8]. Petitioner failed to discharge this burden.

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [9].
