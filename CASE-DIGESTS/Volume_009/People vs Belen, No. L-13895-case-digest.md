I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AMBROSIO BELEN, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-13895, September 30, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of December 9, 1952, in Barrio Basca, Aringay, La Union, eleven accused (Ambrosio Belen and the ten appellants) gathered and went to the house of spouses Hilario Zuniega and Felicisima Peritu. While the majority waited by a nearby brook, Belen and co-accused Crispulo Mabalo entered the house and killed the spouses. The group then buried the victims in a pre-dug grave, cleaned the crime scene, and disposed of the victims' belongings. Belen later pleaded guilty and testified for the prosecution. The ten appellants defense was that they merely acted under the threats and intimidation of Belen and Mabalo. They further argued that their extrajudicial confessions were inadmissible as they were extracted through maltreatment by the Philippine Constabulary. The Court of First Instance convicted all accused of double murder and sentenced them to double life imprisonment.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellants' extrajudicial confessions are admissible.
2. W/N the appellants are criminally liable as conspirators.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held the confessions were voluntary and admissible. The appellants' claims of torture in a public schoolyard were discarded as they were uncorroborated by any witness, despite the alleged public setting. The investigating officers and Justices of the Peace testified to the voluntary nature of the oaths, and the statements contained details known only to the affiants. No medical evidence of injury was presented.

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that conspiracy was proved by the acts of the accused aimed at a common purpose. Their conduct—meeting at a co-accused's house for supper, standing guard during the killing, burying the bodies, and erasing traces of the crime—established a pre-arranged plan. The Court rejected the defense of duress, noting it was implausible for two men to intimidate eight others who had ample opportunity to escape while waiting unguarded at the creek. Under the doctrine of conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all, and the extrajudicial statements of the conspirators are admissible against their co-conspirators. The existence of conspiracy presupposes evident premeditation, which, along with dwelling, constituted aggravating circumstances. The judgment was **AFFIRMED** with the modification that the indemnity be increased to P6,000.00 for each victim.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
