I. CAPTION
MAYOR LUCILO ALKUINO, ET AL. v. HON. ABUNDIO Z. ARRIETA, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-21538-40, October 31, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Teodoro Pepito et al. filed *quo warranto* petitions against Petitioners Mayor Lucilo Alkuino et al. regarding municipal positions in Valencia and Dangcagan, Bukidnon [1]. On June 7, 1963, the Court of First Instance (CFI) presided by Judge Arrieta rendered a decision declaring Respondents entitled to the offices [2]. Copies of the decision were served on June 10, 1963. On the same afternoon, Respondents filed an urgent motion for execution [3]. On the following day, June 11, 1963, Petitioners filed their notice of appeal and cash bonds [3]. Petitioners opposed the execution, arguing that the court had lost jurisdiction upon the filing of their appeal. The trial court nevertheless granted the motion for execution, citing public confusion and chaos in the municipalities as good reasons [3, 4]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, contending the trial court lost jurisdiction to issue the writ of execution once the notice of appeal and cash bonds were filed [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court lost jurisdiction to grant execution pending appeal upon the mere filing of the notice of appeal and cash bond.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the mere filing of the notice of appeal and cash bond does not automatically perfect the appeal or deprive the trial court of jurisdiction [5].

First, the motion for execution was filed on June 10, prior to the filing of the notice of appeal on June 11. To rule otherwise would allow a party to nullify a motion already within the court's jurisdiction simply by filing an appeal [5]. Second, unlike a purely procedural filing, a cash appeal bond requires notice to the adverse party and approval by the court to allow for objections to the amount [6]. Citing *Prisco v. Castelo*, the Court ruled that until the bond is approved, the appeal is not deemed perfected [6]. In this case, the bond was approved by a Justice of the Peace, which was invalid because the presiding CFI Judge was not absent from the district [7]. Consequently, the appeal was not perfected, and the trial court retained jurisdiction to order execution [6, 7].

Petition denied; injunction dissolved.
