I. CAPTION
ENRIQUE J. L. RUIZ and JOSE V. HERRERA v. THE SECRETARY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, et al., G.R. No. L-15526, December 28, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Ruiz and Herrera, minority stockholders of Allied Technologists, Inc., filed a suit against the Secretary of National Defense and architect Pablo Panlilio regarding the construction of the Veterans Memorial Hospital. They sought to prevent the Government from paying the retained 15% of the contract price exclusively to Panlilio, arguing the funds belonged to the corporation. They also prayed for judicial recognition as co-architects of the project to protect their professional prestige.

The construction contract was explicitly signed by the Government with "Allied Technologists, Inc." for engineering services and "Mr. Pablo D. Panlilio, architect" for architectural services. During the proceedings, the defendants admitted that the retained amounts had already been paid to Allied Technologists, Inc., as sought by the plaintiffs. Consequently, the Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint as academic and moot. Plaintiffs appealed, insisting that their claim for recognition as co-architects was a separate cause of action based on Article 21 of the Civil Code that should proceed despite the payment.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claim for recognition as co-architects is a separate cause of action that survives the mootness of the monetary claim.
2. W/N the plaintiffs are entitled to judicial recognition of their professional status under Article 21 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the plaintiffs' complaint presented a single, indivisible cause of action primarily aimed at preventing exclusive payment to Panlilio. The claim for recognition as co-architects was merely incidental to the monetary claim. Since the corporation (Allied Technologists, Inc.) acknowledged receipt of the payment, the entire cause of action dissipated, rendering the case moot [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that Article 21 of the Civil Code applies only when a person has a legal right that is violated in a manner contrary to morals, good customs, or public policy. The plaintiffs had no legal right to recognition as they were not parties to the contract, which expressly designated Panlilio as the architect [3, 4]. Furthermore, the Court held that a judicial declaration is unnecessary to enhance professional prestige, stating that "a brilliant professional enjoys the respect and esteem of his fellowmen, even without a court declaration... while an incompetent one may summon all the tribunals of the world to proclaim his genius in vain" [5, 6].

The Order of the lower court is AFFIRMED [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
