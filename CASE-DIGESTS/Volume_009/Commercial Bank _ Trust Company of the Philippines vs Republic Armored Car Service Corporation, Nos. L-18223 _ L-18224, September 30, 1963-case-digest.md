I. CAPTION
COMMERCIAL BANK & TRUST COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES v. REPUBLIC ARMORED CAR SERVICE CORPORATION and DAMASO PEREZ, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-18223 & L-18224, September 30, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant-appellant Damaso Perez filed a motion for new trial in the Supreme Court based on newly discovered evidence. He claimed he was unaware of the nature of the power of attorney used by his agent, Ramon Racelis, to secure loans for Republic Armored Car Service Corporation and Republic Credit Corporation from the plaintiff-appellee Commercial Bank & Trust Company [1]. Perez argued that Racelis exceeded his authority and that he (Perez) should not be bound as a surety. The promissory notes evidencing the loans were signed "Damaso Perez by Ramon Racelis" and stipulated that Perez agreed to be "jointly and severally" responsible [2, 3]. These notes were attached to the original complaint, but Perez failed to specifically deny their authenticity under oath in his answer before the lower court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Damaso Perez is bound jointly and severally by the loan contracts executed by his agent.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the agent, Ramon Racelis, acted within his authority. The power of attorney authorized the agent to negotiate loans with banking institutions in sums he deemed proper and "to execute any and all documents he deems requisite and necessary" [4]. This general power was held sufficient for the agent to obtain the credits involved.

Furthermore, the contracts explicitly stated that Perez agreed to be responsible **jointly and severally**, negating the contention that he was merely a guarantor [2, 3]. The Court also emphasized that since the promissory notes were attached to the complaint and Perez failed to specifically deny their genuineness and due execution under oath in the lower court, he could not subsequently claim that his agent lacked authority to execute them [3].

The Motion for New Trial is **DENIED** [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
