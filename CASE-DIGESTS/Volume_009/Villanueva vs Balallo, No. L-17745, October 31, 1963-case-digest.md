I. CAPTION
ANTONIO VILLANUEVA v. FELIX BALALLO, G.R. No. L-17745, October 31, 1963, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On December 28, 1959, shortly before his term expired, Mayor Burgonio of Santa, Ilocos Sur appointed petitioner Villanueva as Chief of Police. The Provincial Treasurer, acting as deputy of the Commissioner of Civil Service under Republic Act No. 2260, attested to the appointment. Villanueva, a civil service eligible, took his oath on December 30, 1959. However, on January 5, 1960, the newly elected Mayor Bueno appointed respondent Balallo to the same position. The Commissioner of Civil Service subsequently revoked Villanueva’s appointment, reasoning that the Treasurer's attestation was subject to review and that Balallo had been appointed. Villanueva filed a *quo warranto* proceeding. The Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur dismissed the complaint, sustaining the Commissioner's power to revoke the appointment. Villanueva appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Commissioner of Civil Service may revoke the appointment of a qualified civil service eligible which has already been attested to by the Provincial Treasurer.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that when an appointee is qualified, the Commissioner of Civil Service has no choice but to attest to the appointment. The function of the Commissioner is limited to determining whether the prospective appointee possesses the necessary qualifications. An appointment becomes complete upon the performance of the last act required by law of the appointing power, and the attestation required is merely a check to assure compliance with civil service laws [1, 2].

The Court distinguished this from cases where an appointee is found guilty of irregularities or where Presidential approval is lacking. Here, Villanueva was admittedly qualified and eligible [2, 3]. The attestation by the Provincial Treasurer allowed Villanueva to validly collect salary, indicating the appointment was valid and complete prior to the Commissioner's unfavorable notice. Consequently, the Commissioner could not revoke a valid appointment to replace the appointee with another.

The decision appealed from is REVERSED, and the writ is GRANTED declaring Villanueva the duly appointed Chief of Police.
