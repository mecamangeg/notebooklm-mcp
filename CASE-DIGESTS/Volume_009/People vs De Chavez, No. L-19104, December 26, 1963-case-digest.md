I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, NG KOK CORPORATION v. HILARIO DE CHAVEZ, GREGORIO PROTACIO, and JUAN MENDEZ, G.R. No. L-19104, December 26, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On September 18, 1961, accused Hilario De Chavez, Gregorio Protacio, and Juan Mendez were charged with the theft of canvas materials valued at P2,800.00 belonging to Ng Kok Corporation [1]. On October 6, 1961, all accused pleaded guilty to the charge [1]. The Municipal Court of Lucena City rendered a judgment convicting them and imposing a prison sentence, but failed to mention any civil liability or order the restitution of the stolen goods [2]. The offended party filed a motion for reconsideration within the reglementary period, asking the court to determine civil liability [2]. The trial court denied the motion, reasoning that the plea of guilty only admitted the elements of the crime and that civil liability was evidentiary in nature and could not be determined based solely on the allegations in the complaint [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in refusing to determine the civil liability of the accused after they pleaded guilty.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the institution of a criminal action carries with it the institution of the civil action, unless there is a waiver or reservation by the complainant, which was not present in this case [4]. While the trial court correctly noted that determining the specific amount of liability might be evidentiary, it should have set the motion for reconsideration for a hearing to receive evidence on the value of the stolen property or the feasibility of its return [4]. Citing *People v. Ursua* and *U.S. v. Heery*, the Court ruled that the proper remedy when a lower court fails to provide for civil liability is to remand the case [4].

The Order appealed from is set aside, and the case is remanded to the Municipal Court of Lucena City for further and appropriate proceedings to determine civil liability [5].
