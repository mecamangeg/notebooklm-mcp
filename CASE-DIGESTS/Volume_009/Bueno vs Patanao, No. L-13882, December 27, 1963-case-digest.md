I. CAPTION
VALERIANO C. BUENO v. PEDRO S. PATANAO, JUDGE JESUS S. RUIZ, JUDGE MONTANO A. ORTIZ, and PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF AGUSAN, G.R. No. L-13882, December 27, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Bueno and respondent Patanao were concessionaires of adjacent forest lands in Agusan. Patanao filed a complaint for injunction and damages with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan, alleging that Bueno encroached on his area, illegally cut logs, and used violence and firearms to deter Patanao. Due to the absence of the presiding CFI Judge (Judge Ortiz), the Municipal Judge of Butuan City (Judge Ruiz) was authorized to receive evidence on the prayer for preliminary injunction. Judge Ruiz subsequently granted and issued the writ of preliminary injunction against Bueno.

Bueno sought reconsideration, arguing that Judge Ruiz lacked jurisdiction to issue the writ as his authority was limited to receiving evidence, and that Patanao failed to exhaust administrative remedies since the boundary dispute was still pending before the Bureau of Forestry. Judge Ortiz denied the motion, ruling that Judge Ruiz had jurisdiction under the Judiciary Act in his absence. Bueno filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Municipal Judge had jurisdiction to issue the writ of preliminary injunction.
2. W/N the judicial action was premature due to the non-exhaustion of administrative remedies regarding the boundary dispute.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Section 88 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended, the Municipal Judge of a chartered city possesses interlocutory jurisdiction concurrent with a CFI Judge to hear motions for temporary injunctions and other non-final orders when the CFI Judge is absent. Although Judge Ruiz was initially authorized only to receive evidence, his issuance of the writ occurred while the CFI Judge was still absent from the province. Thus, his act was valid pursuant to the statutory authority vested in him [1], [2].

2. **NO.** While the determination of boundary disputes involving the public domain is primarily administrative (Bureau of Forestry), the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply when questions of public order and contractual relations are involved. The Supreme Court held that considerations of public order must transcend mere administrative boundary issues. The courts must interfere to prevent violence and breaches of peace [3], [4]. Furthermore, the parties had conflicting claims regarding a "royalty" or "lease" agreement, which are essentially judicial questions that only courts can decide [5].

Petition dismissed; the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Supreme Court is dissolved.
