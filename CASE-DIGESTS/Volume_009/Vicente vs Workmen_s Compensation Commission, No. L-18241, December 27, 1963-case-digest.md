I. CAPTION
SANTIAGO VICENTE v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and GONZALO PUYAT & SONS, INC., G.R. No. L-18241, December 27, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Santiago Vicente was employed as a plant mechanic by respondent Gonzalo Puyat & Sons, Inc. On March 30, 1957, while climbing a ladder to clean a boiler gauge, he fell, hitting his chest and the back of his head against a cement wall. Although he lost consciousness briefly, he continued to work. Two weeks later, he began suffering from memory loss and purposeless movements. He was hospitalized and diagnosed with cerebral vascular disease and encephalopathy secondary to cerebral arteriosclerosis.

Vicente filed a claim for compensation. The Hearing Officer dismissed the claim, ruling that cerebral arteriosclerosis is a result of the aging process and existed prior to the accident. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed the dismissal, holding that the disability was the result of the natural progress of the disease and not an aggravation caused by the fall, noting that Vicente continued working immediately after the accident.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner’s pre-existing illness (cerebral arteriosclerosis) was aggravated by the accident, rendering it compensable.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that while the arteriosclerosis may have pre-existed, the accident accelerated its development into encephalopathy. Under Section 2 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, an illness is compensable if it is "aggravated by or the result of the nature of such employment."

The Court relied on the doctrine that the pre-existence of an illness is not a ground for disallowance if the accidental injury caused a dormant condition to flare up (*Oklahoma Ry. Co. v. Voss*; *Blue Bar Coconut Co. v. Boo*). Expert testimony indicated that the degree of arteriosclerosis suffered by the petitioner (aged 48) was abnormal for his age, and the fact that physical decay began dating from the accident creates a reasonable presumption that the injury was the exciting cause (*Osier & McCrae*). Furthermore, the Workmen's Compensation Act is social legislation that must be liberally construed in favor of the workman.

The petition is **GRANTED**. The decision of the WCC is reversed, and the respondent company is ordered to pay compensation.
