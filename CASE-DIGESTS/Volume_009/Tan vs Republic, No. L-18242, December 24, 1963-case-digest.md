**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF OSCAR TAN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, OSCAR TAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18242, December 24, 1963, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
Oscar Tan, a citizen of the Republic of China and a second-year pre-med student at the University of Santo Tomas, filed a petition for naturalization [1]. He claimed to have a lucrative trade as a partner in his father's dry goods and "sari-sari" business in Tuao, Cagayan, alleging he was given P5,000 by his father to invest, generating an income of P130 to P170 per month [1, 2]. However, Tan submitted no documentary evidence such as partnership papers, business registration, or receipts of tax payments to prove the partnership existed [3]. He also paid no income tax and lacked a Class B residence certificate [2]. The Court of First Instance of Cagayan granted the petition [1]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing Tan failed to prove he possessed a lucrative trade or profession [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner possesses the lucrative trade, profession, or occupation required by law for naturalization.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court found the petitioner’s claim of having a share in his father’s business to be of "doubtful veracity" due to the total absence of written evidence, such as partnership papers or income tax returns, to prove its existence [3, 4]. The Court concluded the alleged partnership was merely a scheme to satisfy the legal requirements [5]. Furthermore, the Court ruled that even if the alleged income of P130 to P170 per month were true, such an amount is not considered sufficiently lucrative to satisfy the requirement of the law [6, 7]. Under Section 2, paragraph 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, an applicant must possess a lucrative trade, profession, or occupation [7]. Citing *Que Choc Qui v. Republic* and *Sy Ang Hoc v. Republic*, the Court held Tan failed to meet this qualification [7].

The order appealed from is set aside, and the petition for naturalization is dismissed [8].
