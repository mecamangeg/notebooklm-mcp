I. CAPTION
RODRIGO COLOSO v. DOMINGO DE JESUS, et al., G.R. No. L-18824, September 30, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On February 12, 1955, Florentina N. Vda. de Jesus entered into a contract with Rodrigo Coloso granting him the exclusive right to manage her 315-hectare land in Samal, Bataan [1]. The agreement required Coloso to introduce permanent improvements, such as clearing the land and installing an irrigation system, within two years [1]. The contract further granted Coloso the option to purchase the property for P60,000 within 10 years [1]. Subsequently, the Land Tenure Administration assessed the property and noted improvements like feeder roads, though a government purchase did not materialize [2, 3]. When Coloso sought to exercise his option to buy, the defendants (administrators and heirs of the now-deceased landowner) resisted, arguing Coloso failed to perfect his right because he did not introduce the required improvements [4, 5]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Coloso, ordering the defendants to execute a deed of sale upon his payment of the agreed price [6]. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Coloso complied with the condition to introduce improvements, entitling him to the execution of the deed of sale.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court found that Coloso substantially complied with his obligation to clear the land and make improvements thereon [5]. The evidence showed that tenants were able to plant palay (rice) on the land, which would have been impossible had the originally wooded area not been cleared [4]. Furthermore, a resolution by the Land Tenure Administration committee corroborated the existence of improvements, specifically citing "various improvements" and "feeder roads" as justification for increasing the land's assessed value [4]. Coloso also testified to spending at least P20,000 on clearing and irrigation [4]. The Court rejected the testimony of the defense witness regarding the lack of improvements, noting the witness failed to properly inspect the property [4]. Since the condition was met, the lower court correctly ordered the execution of the deed of sale upon payment of the agreed price [5, 7].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [8].
