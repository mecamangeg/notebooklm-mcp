I. CAPTION
EMBASSY MOTORS WORKERS UNION (PAFLU) v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ET AL., No. L-18685, September 13, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Embassy Motors Workers Union (PAFLU) secured a final judgment against Embassy Motors, Inc. for unfair labor practice, resulting in the reinstatement of 15 employees. Three weeks later, the company petitioned the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to lay off the same employees due to alleged business losses. Judge Tabigne issued an order on November 20, 1958, authorizing the lay-off. The company immediately laid off the workers without waiting for the order to become final.

On appeal, the CIR *en banc* issued a resolution on February 14, 1959, reversing Judge Tabigne’s order. Two judges voted to reverse on the merits, while one judge concurred in the result citing lack of jurisdiction. When the union moved for execution to reinstate the workers with back wages, Judge Tabigne denied the motion, arguing the February 14 resolution was ineffective because the concurring judges relied on different grounds. The CIR *en banc* sustained this denial.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a CIR *en banc* resolution is valid when the concurring judges agree on the result but rely on different reasons.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that under Section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 103, the validity of a decision requires only the "concurrence of at least three of the five Judges" on the *result*, not on the issues or reasons. It is not necessary for the requisite number of judges to agree on the reasoning; if they arrive at the same conclusion, the law is satisfied [1]. Here, three judges agreed to set aside the order authorizing the lay-off—two on the merits and one on jurisdiction [1]. Thus, the resolution is valid.

Since the order authorizing the lay-off was voided and the company had implemented the lay-off prematurely before said order became final, the necessary corollary is that the employees must be immediately reinstated with back wages [2].

Petition granted. The CIR is ordered to execute the February 14, 1959 resolution and reinstate the employees with back wages [3].
