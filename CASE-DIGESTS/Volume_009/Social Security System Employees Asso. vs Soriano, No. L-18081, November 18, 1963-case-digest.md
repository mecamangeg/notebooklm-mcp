I. CAPTION
SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION (PAFLU) v. THE HON. JUDGE E. SORIANO, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-18081, November 18, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Respondents filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Supreme Court’s decision dated April 30, 1963, contesting the classification of the Social Security System (SSS) as an entity performing proprietary functions [2, 3]. To resolve the motion, the Court reviewed evidence elevated from the lower court (Civil Case No. 48516) regarding the nature of the SSS's functions [3].

The evidence showed that the Secretary of Finance had previously denied the SSS's request for tax exemption on imported equipment, ruling that the SSS performs functions "similar to a business corporation" rather than strictly governmental ones [4, 5]. Additionally, the Government Corporate Counsel opined that the SSS is not part of the national government and possesses separate corporate powers, allowing it to construct a building without the Bureau of Public Works' supervision [6, 7]. Furthermore, SSS brochures and financial reports described the system as an "insurance scheme" and showed that its funds were invested for profit in real estate, stocks, and bonds, resulting in significant asset growth [8-11].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Social Security System (SSS) performs proprietary functions and is subject to the Magna Carta of Labor.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the Social Security System is a government-owned or controlled corporation performing basically proprietary functions, and as such, it comes under the operation of the Magna Carta of Labor [2].

The Court reasoned that the SSS operates under the same insurance principles as the GSIS and is not strictly a government project [12]. This is supported by the fact that other government agencies, such as the Department of Finance and the Government Corporate Counsel, treat the SSS as distinct from the national government with functions similar to a business corporation [5, 7]. The SSS invests its funds for profit in various commercial ventures to extend benefits to members, further confirming its proprietary nature [10].

Accordingly, the Motion for Reconsideration was denied [1].
