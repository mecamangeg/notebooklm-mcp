I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SEGUNDO SIOSON and PASCUALA BAUTISTA, G.R. No. L-13687, November 29, 1963, 9 SCRA 533, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On November 6, 1951, Spouses Sioson and Bautista applied for the registration of four parcels of land in Paombong, Bulacan. The Director of Lands opposed the registration of one parcel (Lot 4), arguing it was part of the public domain. On January 30, 1954, the Court of First Instance (CFI) adjudicated Lots 1, 2, and 3 to the spouses but made no adjudication regarding Lot 4. The spouses appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA) regarding Lot 4. During the appeal, the Solicitor General recommended the registration of Lot 4 in favor of the spouses. Consequently, on January 31, 1955, the CA modified the judgment and decreed the registration of Lot 4.

On April 25, 1956, within one year of the decree's entry, the Republic filed a petition for review of the decree of registration in the CFI, alleging actual and extrinsic fraud by the spouses for concealing facts and conniving with the land inspector. The Republic argued Lot 4 was part of a navigable river. The spouses opposed, citing *res judicata* and estoppel. On September 18, 1956, the CFI denied the petition without conducting a hearing or receiving evidence. The Republic appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in denying the petition for review of the decree of registration without a hearing on the allegations of fraud.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the lower court's order. The petition for review was filed within one year from the entry of the decree and specifically alleged actual and extrinsic fraud. The Court held that "there being an allegation of actual and extrinsic fraud the Court should have afforded the petitioner an opportunity to prove it." Furthermore, the Court emphasized the substantive principle that "navigable rivers cannot be appropriated and registered under the Land Registration Act." If the lot in question forms part of the bed of a navigable stream, creek, or river, the decree and title issued to the respondents would not confer any right or title to them.

The Order is set aside and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.
