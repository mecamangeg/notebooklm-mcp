**I. CAPTION**
ITOGON-SUYOC MINES, INC. v. FRUTO DULAY and WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-18974, September 30, 1963, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Fruto Dulay was previously rejected by Antamok Mining Company in 1950 and 1951 due to "Far Advanced PTB." However, on April 30, 1952, he was hired by petitioner Itogon-Suyoc Mines, Inc. as a mucker after passing a pre-employment physical examination by the company physician, Dr. Ramon Pellicer, though no X-ray was taken. His work involved boring holes with a 200-pound machine, lifting heavy timber, and working in a hot environment without adequate ventilation. On July 7, 1954, a new company physician, Dr. Hugo Rosa, X-rayed Dulay and discovered he was suffering from "Far advanced chronic P.T.B." Dulay stopped working on July 16, 1954, upon the doctor's advice. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) ruled that Dulay’s ailment was aggravated by the nature of his work and ordered the petitioner to pay compensation and provide continuous medical services until the illness is cured. The petitioner appealed, arguing there was no evidence the illness was arrested prior to employment and that liability for medical care should not extend beyond the employment period or the statutory limit for compensation.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N Dulay’s illness is compensable on the ground of aggravation by employment.
2. W/N the employer’s liability for medical care is limited to the duration of employment or the 208-week compensation limit.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** Dulay passed the pre-employment physical examination and was allowed to work for over two years, implying he was fit at the time of hiring. Even if he had TB prior to employment, the nature of his work—operating a heavy machine and lifting timber in hot conditions—"could not but aggravate his illness." Under Section 2 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act (Act No. 3428), an illness is compensable if it is "either aggravated by or the result of the nature of such employment."

2. **NO.** The Court rejected the petitioner’s contention that liability for medical care ends with the employment relationship or is subject to the 208-week limit applicable to compensation payments. Citing *La Mallorca-Pambusco v. Isip*, the Court held that Section 13 does not require an existing employer-employee relationship; the obligation subsists as long as the employee is sick. The limits found in Sections 12, 14, 16, and 18 refer to *compensation*, while liability for *medical care* under Section 13 lasts during the entire period of disability.

**WHEREFORE**, the decision and resolution of the Commission are affirmed.
