I. CAPTION
WILLIAM Li YAO v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-11875, December 28, 1963, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner William Li Yao, a naturalized Filipino businessman and president of Far East Realty & Investment Co. (FERIN), was assessed by the respondent Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) for deficiency income taxes for the years 1945 to 1951. The CIR utilized the "Net Worth or Inventory Method" to determine Petitioner's unreported income. Li Yao contested the assessment before the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), claiming various liabilities (loans from third parties) to lower his net worth and arguing that certain assets attributed to him belonged to others. The CTA upheld the use of the Net Worth Method but reduced the total liability to P411,293.80. The CTA disallowed Li Yao's alleged loans for lack of proof and found that huge investments in FERIN made by his low-wage employees (a driver and a bodyguard) were actually Li Yao's assets, treating them as "dummies." Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the method used, the findings on assets and liabilities, and requesting that his unreported income be "spread" evenly over the years involved to reduce the tax rate.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Collector of Internal Revenue is authorized to use the Net Worth or Inventory Method to assess taxes.
2. W/N the CTA erred in disallowing Petitioner's alleged debts and including the investments of "dummies" in his net worth.
3. W/N the unreported income should be spread evenly over the entire period of assessment (1945-1951) instead of being taxed in the year it appeared.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Collector is authorized to use the Net Worth Method under **Section 15 of the National Internal Revenue Code (Commonwealth Act No. 466)**, which allows the assessment of taxes based on "any other available fact or evidence" when a taxpayer hides their income. The Court held that a presumption of regularity attaches to the Collector's use of the best evidence obtainable; otherwise, it would be impossible to assess taxes due from dishonest taxpayers [1].

2. **NO.** The CTA correctly applied the rules of evidence, holding that a taxpayer who alleges the existence of obligations to reduce their tax liability must prove them by a preponderance of evidence [2]. Petitioner failed to produce the alleged creditors or credible documentary proof [3]. Furthermore, the Court affirmed that the investments of P100,000 each made by Petitioner's bodyguard and driver in FERIN were actually Petitioner's assets. The Court found it incredible that employees with meager incomes could afford such investments, leading to the conclusion that they were mere "dummies" for the Petitioner [4], [5].

3. **NO.** **Section 39 of the National Internal Revenue Code** requires taxpayers to report income in the year it is received [6]. The Court rejected Petitioner's plea to apply the "spreading method" used in the US case *U.S. v. Ridley*, noting that Petitioner did not claim the funds were accumulated savings [7]. The Court ruled that permitting the spreading of income would tolerate violations of the law and encourage tax evasion by allowing dishonest taxpayers to reduce their liability upon discovery [6].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed [8].
