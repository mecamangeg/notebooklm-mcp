I. CAPTION
ROBERTO F. BAUTISTA, ET AL. v. EMETERIO DE LA CRUZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21107, December 24, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On January 26, 1962, respondents Emeterio De La Cruz, et al. filed a petition with the Justice of the Peace Court (JPC) of Hagonoy, Bulacan, seeking to annul the barrio elections held on January 24, 1962 [1]. They alleged that the barrio council failed to provide the required notice to qualified residents, preventing them from voting [2]. Petitioners Roberto F. Bautista, et al. moved to dismiss the petition on the grounds of lack of personality to sue and lack of jurisdiction [1]. The JPC denied the motion, ruling that it had jurisdiction under Republic Act No. 2370 [3]. Bautista, et al. filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance, which was seemingly dismissed, leading to this appeal. Petitioners argued that the Revised Election Code, not the JPC, should govern the dispute [4], [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Justice of the Peace Court has jurisdiction over the petition to annul barrio elections.
2. W/N the denial of the motion to dismiss is the proper subject of a petition for certiorari.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the petition was a dispute over a barrio election, as it sought to nullify the elections due to non-compliance with notice requirements [5]. Under Section 7, Article II of Republic Act No. 2370 (Barrio Charter), all disputes over barrio elections must be brought before the Justice of the Peace Court of the corresponding municipality [6], [5]. The Court clarified that the Revised Election Code applies to provincial and municipal officials, not to barrio officials [4].

2. **NO.** The order of the JPC denying the motion to dismiss is merely interlocutory and cannot be the subject of an appeal or a petition for certiorari [7]. The proper procedure is to continue with the trial on the merits and, if the decision is adverse, reiterate the issue on appeal [7].

Petition is **DENIED**. The case is remanded to the Justice of the Peace Court of Hagonoy, Bulacan, for further proceedings [7].
