**I. CAPTION**
MUNICIPALITY OF NAGUILIAN v. NATIONAL WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY, G.R. No. L-18540, November 29, 1963.

**II. FACTS**
The Municipality of Naguilian, La Union, constructed, maintained, and operated the Naguilian Waterworks System using its own funds. In August 1956, pursuant to Republic Act No. 1383, the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) took over the control and administration of the waterworks system. The transfer was involuntary [1]. The Municipality filed a special civil action for declaratory relief in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of La Union, arguing that R.A. 1383 is unconstitutional for taking its property without just compensation. The parties stipulated that the waterworks system belonged to the Municipality and was transferred involuntarily [2, 3]. The CFI rendered judgment in favor of the Municipality. NAWASA appealed, contending that it could exercise jurisdiction, supervision, and control over the system under the state's police power without necessarily acquiring ownership [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N Republic Act No. 1383 is unconstitutional insofar as it transfers ownership of the municipal waterworks to NAWASA without just compensation.
2. W/N the takeover of the waterworks system by NAWASA constitutes a valid exercise of police power.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court held that Republic Act No. 1383 is unconstitutional insofar as it transfers the ownership of waterworks belonging to municipal corporations to NAWASA without the payment of just compensation. Citing *City of Baguio v. NAWASA*, *City of Cebu v. NAWASA*, and *Municipality of Lucban v. NAWASA*, the Court reiterated that municipal waterworks are patrimonial property of the municipality [5]. Consequently, the municipality cannot be deprived of such property without the payment of its market value, and the Act fails to provide for effective payment of this compensation, thereby violating the Constitution [5].

2. **NO.** The Court overruled NAWASA's contention that the Act is a valid exercise of police power. The Court reasoned that R.A. 1383 does not merely transfer the administration of the property for purposes of supervision or control; rather, it conveys ownership, beneficial interest, and dominion over the waterworks to the new agency [4, 6]. A law that transfers ownership of patrimonial property from one government agency to another without just compensation is not a valid exercise of police power [4].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [7].
