I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MOROS USAB MOHAMAD @ KIRA SAHAD @ BIRA, ET. AL., GONZALIN @ GONZALES and UBAY, G.R. No. L-14583, December 28, 1963, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On January 26, 1957, in Basilan City, ten armed men, including accused Gonzalin and Ubay, conspired to rob the payroll money of the American Rubber Plantation [1]. They hid in the bushes near the Calabasa Airfield and ambushed Wilfredo de Leon (paymaster) and Florentino Morales (driver) [2], [3]. Morales escaped, but De Leon was shot and hacked to death; the bandits took his watch, revolver, and cash totaling P1,069.25 [3]. Co-accused Usab Mohamad pleaded guilty, while Gonzalin and Ubay pleaded not guilty [1]. The prosecution presented eyewitness testimony from Morales and bystanders who saw the accused fleeing, as well as a blood-stained notebook belonging to the victim found in Gonzalin's possession [4], [5]. The trial court convicted Gonzalin and Ubay of robbery in band with murder and sentenced them to death [6]. The case was elevated for compulsory review [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the guilt of Gonzalin and Ubay for robbery in band with murder was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence. The accused were positively identified by Morales, who knew them personally as former plantation employees, and by other witnesses who saw them fleeing the scene armed [5], [8]. Their guilt was further established by the recovery of the victim's blood-stained notebook from Gonzalin [9].

Regarding the conspiracy and participation, the Court relied on the extrajudicial statements and the reenactment performed by co-accused Usab. Although Usab tried to exculpate Gonzalin and Ubay during the trial, the Court held that his evasive testimony could not overcome his previous affidavits and his voluntary participation in a constabulary reenactment [10], [11]. In said reenactment, Usab specifically portrayed Gonzalin and Ubay aiming their guns at the victim [11]. The Court ruled that a voluntary reenactment is admissible and renders a subsequent denial unbelievable [12], [13].

Decision affirmed [14].
