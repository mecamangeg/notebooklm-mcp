I. CAPTION
**DAMASO ALIPIO, et al. v. JOSE V. RODRIGUEZ, et al.**, G.R. No. L-17336, December 26, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were laborers appointed in 1951 to the Osmeña Waterworks System in Cebu City for a reforestation project [1]. Their appointments were noted as temporary pending GSIS reports [1]. They were separated from service when the Municipal Board abolished their positions due to insufficient funds and the completion of the project [2]. Although the budget ordinance covering the abolition was approved in April 1953, it was made retroactive to July 1, 1952 [2]. Petitioners sought the intercession of a Senator in January 1955 but did not file their petition for mandamus for reinstatement and back wages until August 17, 1955, more than three years after their separation [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance of Cebu dismissed the petition on the grounds of the validity of the abolition, the temporary nature of the appointments, and laches [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the abolition of the petitioners' positions was valid.
2. W/N the petition for reinstatement is barred by laches.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The abolition of positions in a city appropriation ordinance is within the power of the Municipal Board which created them [2, 5]. The recognized exception to this power is when the abolition is done in bad faith, such as for the purpose of discharging an incumbent in violation of civil service law [2, 5]. In this case, the Court found no bad faith, as the funds were insufficient and the reforestation work for which the petitioners were employed was practically finished [2].

2. **YES.** The petitioners filed the instant petition more than three years after they were separated from the service, which constitutes inexcusable delay [3]. Citing *Unabia v. City Mayor of Cebu*, the Court held that any person claiming a right to a position in the civil service must file their petition for reinstatement within one year; otherwise, they are considered to have abandoned their office [4, 6]. The petitioners' attempt to pursue "extra-legal" remedies, such as asking a Senator to intercede, did not excuse the delay or toll the prescriptive period [3, 4].

The judgment affirmed [7, 8].
