I. CAPTION
SULPICIO GADON v. PEDRO GADON, G.R. No. L-20015, November 30, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In the November 10, 1959 elections for Mayor of Despujols, Romblon, candidates Sulpicio Gadon (Protestant) and Pedro Gadon (Protestee), both bearing the middle name "Reyes," contested the seat. Pedro was proclaimed winner by the municipal board of canvassers with a plurality of three votes (642 vs. 639) [1]. Sulpicio filed a protest covering two precincts. Pedro answered with a counter-protest covering six precincts, including Precinct 3-A [2].

After the statutory period for filing a protest had expired, Sulpicio amended his petition to include Precinct 3-A, which the trial court admitted [2]. The trial court eventually ruled in favor of Sulpicio, declaring him the winner by 11 votes [2]. Both parties appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court due to the jurisdictional issue raised regarding the amended protest [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the amended protest regarding a precinct (3-A) filed after the statutory deadline.
2. W/N ballots containing prefixes, misplaced names, or initials constituting potential "marks" are valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The admission of the amended petition after the statutory period was correct because the specific precinct (3-A) was already within the jurisdiction of the court by virtue of the protestee's counter-protest [3], [4]. The counter-protest required the opening of ballot boxes and recounting, effectively throwing the ballots open for the court's consideration for both parties [4]. The Court relied on the doctrine in *Cecilio v. Tomacruz* [4].

2. **YES (Qualified).** The Court applied the following rules on appreciation of ballots:
   *   **Prefixes:** The use of prefixes like "Manong," "Dr.," or "Datu" does not invalidate a ballot unless a pattern reveals an intention to mark. These are considered respectful expressions under Section 149 of the Revised Election Code [5].
   *   **Initials:** Where candidates share the same surname and middle initial (R. Gadon), the first letter is crucial. A letter resembling "P" stands for Pedro, distinguishing him from Sulpicio [6], [7].
   *   **Misplaced/Stray Votes:** Writing a candidate's name in the wrong space (e.g., "Pajo" for Senator in the councilors' line) constitutes a stray vote but does not invalidate the entire ballot as "marked" absent evidence of intent to identify [8], [9].
   *   **Marked Ballots:** However, ballots with unexplained prominent letters like "O.P.", the word "Daldo", or expressions like "My vote is heartily dedicated" are considered marked and invalid [10], [11], [12].

   **Disposition:** Judgment reversed. Pedro Gadon is declared the winner by 11 votes [13].
