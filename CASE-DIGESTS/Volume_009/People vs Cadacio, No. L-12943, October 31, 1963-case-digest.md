I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ELIAS CADACIO and JULIAN OBRADOR, G.R. No. L-12943, October 31, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On April 24, 1955, in Lemery, Batangas, a jeepney driven by Leoncio Razon was ambushed, resulting in the deaths of Dionisio de Leus, Serapia Gamboa, and Geminiano Lagrosa, and injuries to Razon, Simplicio Gamboa, and Pastor Kamson [1, 2]. Earlier that morning, Razon had ignored appellant Elias Cadacio’s signal to stop the jeepney [3, 4]. During the ambush that afternoon, the survivors identified Cadacio and appellant Julian Obrador as the gunmen firing at them in broad daylight [5, 6]. The trial court convicted the appellants of triple murder and attempted murder [7]. On appeal, the defense questioned the credibility of the witnesses because they did not immediately reveal the identities of the attackers to the authorities [8]. The defense also presented Paulino Huertas, a self-confessed "Huk" participant in the ambush, who testified that the appellants were not involved [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the identification of the accused was sufficient to sustain a conviction despite the witnesses' initial silence and the exculpatory testimony of a defense witness.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the conviction, ruling that the identification of the appellants was positive and credible as the witnesses knew them personally and the crime occurred in broad daylight [10]. The Court held that the witnesses' initial silence regarding the identity of the gunmen was "readily understandable" because the accused were reputed "Huks," implying a natural fear of reprisal [10, 11]. Furthermore, the testimony of the defense witness Huertas, a fellow "Huk," exonerating the appellants was rejected as a "futile move," as the Court was not disposed to believe the exculpation provided by a confederate [12, 13]. The defense of alibi was also rejected due to the proximity of the appellants to the crime scene [13]. The Court affirmed the judgment with modification, awarding additional indemnity for the medical expenses of the survivors [14, 15].
