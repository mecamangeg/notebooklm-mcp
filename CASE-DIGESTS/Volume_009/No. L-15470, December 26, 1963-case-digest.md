I. CAPTION
CONNEL BROS. CO. (PHIL.) v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-15470, December 26, 1963, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Connel Bros. Co. (Phil.), a domestic corporation engaged in the importation of general merchandise, contested a deficiency sales tax assessment for the period from January 18, 1948, to January 31, 1949 [1, 2]. Previously, Petitioner’s invoices itemized the selling price and the 5% sales tax separately, which was accepted as compliance [3]. However, during the period in question, Petitioner’s invoices merely showed a single total amount with the notation "5% sales tax included" [3]. Petitioner paid the sales tax based on the actual selling price (excluding the shifted tax), but the Respondent Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed the tax based on the total amount paid by the customers, ruling that the tax was not "separately billed" and thus formed part of the gross selling price [3, 4]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) denied Petitioner's claim for a refund of the deficiency but reduced the amount [1, 2]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the notation "5% sales tax included" on invoices satisfies the "separate billing" requirement to allow the deduction of the tax amount from the gross selling price.
2. W/N the petitioner is liable for the 25% surcharge on the deficiency.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the mere notation "5% sales tax included" does not comply with General Circulars Nos. 431 and 440, which implement Section 186 of the National Internal Revenue Code [5, 6]. Section 186 imposes the tax on the "gross selling price," defined as the total amount paid by the purchaser [5, 7]. The Circulars allow for the deduction of the tax amount from the gross selling price only as a privilege/exception, provided the tax is "billed to the purchaser as separate items" [6, 7]. The Court held that "separate billing" strictly means the tax amount must be stated as an item apart from the selling price to apprise the customer of the exact tax passed on to them [6]. Consequently, without proper separate billing, the tax is considered part of the gross selling price and cannot be deducted [3, 6]. The Petitioner could not rely on a subsequent Board of Tax Appeals ruling (*Fred Wilson case*) which allowed such notation, as that case was decided in 1952, after the sales in question occurred [8].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the 25% surcharge should not be imposed. The Petitioner did not delay filing the returns for the period in question and did not intentionally violate the law [9]. The delay was only in the payment of the deficiency, which arose from a good faith mistake in understanding the regulations [9].

**Judgment affirmed with modification** (surcharge eliminated) [10].
