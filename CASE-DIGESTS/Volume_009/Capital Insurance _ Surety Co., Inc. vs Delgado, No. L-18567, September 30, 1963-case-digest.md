I. CAPTION
THE CAPITAL INSURANCE AND SURETY COMPANY, INC. v. MARIO DELGADO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18567, September 30, 1963, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Capital Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. issued a Fire Insurance Policy (and subsequently a renewal certificate) covering the properties of Mario Delgado and Leonor Delgado Dee in Cebu City. The premiums totaled P583.95. Despite the issuance of the policy and a demand letter from the insurance company, Delgado failed to pay. In a letter, Delgado admitted the unpaid account and requested an extension, yet still defaulted.

Capital Insurance filed a collection suit in the Municipal Court of Cebu City, which ruled in their favor. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu affirmed the decision. When Delgado appealed to the Supreme Court, the case was initially dismissed because the Record on Appeal erroneously stated the case was filed in the CFI, which lacked original jurisdiction over the amount. Capital Insurance moved for reconsideration, proving via a Clerk of Court certification that the case actually originated in the Municipal Court and was properly appealed to the CFI.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court should set aside its previous dismissal of the case based on an error in the Record on Appeal.
2. W/N the insured is obligated to pay the insurance premiums after the policy has been issued and delivered.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The ground for the initial dismissal—that the CFI lacked original jurisdiction—was proven incorrect. Evidence showed the case originated in the Municipal Court (an inferior court) and was merely appealed to the CFI. The error in the Record on Appeal regarding the court of origin does not bar the correction of the record to reflect the true procedural history [1-3].

2. **YES.** Upon the issuance and delivery of the insurance policy to the insured, the contract became effective and binding on both parties. Consequently, the insured cannot avoid the obligation to pay the agreed premiums [4, 5]. The Court noted that Delgado expressly admitted the existence of the unpaid account and even requested an extension of time to pay, further solidifying his liability [3, 5].

**Disposition:** Original decision set aside; appealed decision affirmed.
