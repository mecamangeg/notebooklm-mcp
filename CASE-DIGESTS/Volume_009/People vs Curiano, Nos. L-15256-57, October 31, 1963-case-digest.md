I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PASCUAL CURIANO, CANDIDO VIOLANTE, FRANCISCO TAFALLA, MARCELO (LUCILO) TAFALLA, SANTOS TAFALLA, PAMFILO BALASBAS, HERMENEGILDO TAFALLA, and OLIMPIO TAFALLA, G.R. Nos. L-15256-57, October 31, 1963, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of April 30, 1957, in Sitio Cagutsan, Samar, the eight appellants, led by Pascual Curiano, armed with a rifle and bolos, attacked the hut of Rafael Yboa and his tenants, the Errabo family. Juanita Yboa, Rafael's wife, survived by hiding in the bushes and witnessed Curiano shoot her husband, while the other appellants hacked Daniel Errabo, Engracia Salazar, and their two-year-old son, Mario, to death. The bodies were dragged to the beach, tied to stones, and sunk in the sea, but were later recovered floating. The motive was a land dispute between Rafael Yboa and the appellants.

The Court of First Instance of Samar convicted all appellants of Murder (for Rafael) and Multiple Murder (for the Errabos), sentencing them to death. Pending automatic review, appellants filed a motion for new trial based on "newly discovered evidence" consisting of affidavits of recantation and statements implicating other persons. The appellants' primary defense during trial was alibi.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a new trial should be granted based on affidavits of recantation and impeaching evidence.
2. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over positive identification.
3. W/N the crime was attended by aggravating circumstances.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Affidavits of recantation or evidence seeking to impeach the prosecution's evidence do not constitute grounds for a new trial unless there is no other evidence sustaining the conviction. The Court held that if a new trial were granted every time an interested party induced witnesses to vary their testimony, litigation would never end. The Court cited *U.S. v. Smith* and *People v. Ubiña*, noting that appellate courts are wary of recantations compared to testimony given under oath in open court.

2. **NO.** The appellants' alibis were fabricated and did not demonstrate physical impossibility of their presence at the crime scene. The Court applied the doctrine in *People v. Alban*, ruling that positive identification by the eyewitness, Juanita Yboa, who testified in a clear and straightforward manner, outweighs the defense of alibi.

3. **YES.** The Court found the existence of conspiracy and the following circumstances:
   *   **Treachery:** The attack was sudden and unexpected, ensuring execution without risk.
   *   **Evident Premeditation:** Ropes and stones for sinking the bodies were prepared in the banca beforehand.
   *   **Abuse of Superior Strength:** Eight armed assailants against three unarmed adults and a child.
   *   **Uninhabited Place:** The crime scene was isolated, over 100 meters from the nearest house.
   *   **Dwelling:** Applicable to the killing of the Errabos.
   *   *Note:* Nighttime was absorbed in treachery; Cruelty was not appreciated as the wounds were not shown to be inflicted to prolong suffering.

**Disposition:** The judgment of conviction is **AFFIRMED** with **MODIFICATION**. Due to the lack of the necessary number of votes for the death penalty, the sentence is reduced to **life imprisonment** for each of the four crimes. The indemnity is increased to P6,000.00.
