I. CAPTION
TOMAS A. BORJA v. DIOSCORO DE LEON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20245, September 30, 1963, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Borja and Respondent De Leon were candidates for mayor of Gapan, Nueva Ecija in the November 10, 1959 elections [1]. The municipal board of canvassers proclaimed De Leon the winner by 96 votes [1]. Borja filed an election protest in the Court of First Instance (CFI) alleging fraud in several precincts [1]. The CFI ordered a recount of Precinct 22-A and amended its decision, declaring De Leon the winner by a reduced plurality of 8 votes [2]. Both parties appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA). However, De Leon’s appeal was dismissed for failure to file a brief, and he was barred from filing a brief as appellee [2]. The CA rendered judgment declaring De Leon the winner by 37 votes [2, 3]. Borja filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing the CA lacked jurisdiction to pass upon over 300 ballots that were not assigned as errors in his brief nor discussed by De Leon [3]. The CA denied the motion [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals may examine and rule upon ballots *motu proprio* even if they were not assigned as errors or discussed in the parties' briefs.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the appellate court has the right to examine any ballot *motu proprio* if necessary to arrive at a correct decision, pursuant to **Section 175 of the Revised Election Code** [4, 5]. While the general rule requires appellants to point out errors regarding specific ballots to guide the court, this does not deprive the court of its power to examine ballots not assigned as errors [5]. An appeal in an election case is likened to an appeal in a criminal case under **Section 178 of the Revised Election Code**, where the case is deemed tried *de novo*, throwing the appeal wide open to the court [5, 6]. Election cases involve public interest, imposing an imperative duty on the court to ascertain the true will of the electorate regardless of technicalities or procedural barriers [7].

The decision of the Court of Appeals was **AFFIRMED** [8].
