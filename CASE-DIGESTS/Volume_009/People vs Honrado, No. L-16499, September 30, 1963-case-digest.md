I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LEODIZON HONRADO, ANSELMO LEONIN and REGINO LEONIN, G.R. No. L-16499, September 30, 1963, Bengzon, C.J.**

II. FACTS
On May 30, 1959, at the United Restaurant in Rosales, Pangasinan, appellants Leodizon Honrado and Regino Leonin were drinking when they caused a disturbance. Tan Sek Yee, the restaurant owner, tried to stop them, but they resisted and dragged him outside, where they boxed him. During the scuffle, appellant Anselmo Leonin arrived in a jeepney, grabbed an iron bar, and without warning, struck Tan Sek Yee three times on the head and neck. The victim died immediately of cerebral hemorrhage. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan convicted all three appellants of murder, finding that they conspired to kill the victim with treachery, and sentenced them to life imprisonment. The appellants appealed, challenging the findings of conspiracy and treachery.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a conspiracy existed among the three appellants to kill the victim.
2. W/N the crime committed by Anselmo Leonin was murder.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held there was no conspiracy. The evidence failed to show any prior plan or motive to kill the victim. Anselmo's arrival was purely coincidental, as he regularly passed that street. He joined the fray on impulse upon seeing his companion in a fight. Citing *People v. Ibañez* and *People v. Delfin*, the Court ruled that in the absence of conspiracy, criminal liability is individual. Consequently, Regino and Leodizon, who only boxed the victim, are not responsible for the death caused by Anselmo.

2. **YES.** The killing was attended by treachery. Anselmo attacked the victim suddenly and without warning while the victim was defending himself against Regino and Leodizon. The victim was unaware of Anselmo's presence and could not defend against the fatal blows.

**ACCORDINGLY**, the decision is **MODIFIED**. Anselmo Leonin is convicted of **Murder** and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* and to indemnify the heirs P6,000.00. Regino Leonin and Leodizon Honrado are convicted only of **Slight Physical Injuries** and sentenced to 20 days of *arresto menor*.
