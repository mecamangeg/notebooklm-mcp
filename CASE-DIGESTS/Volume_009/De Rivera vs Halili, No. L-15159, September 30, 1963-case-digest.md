I. CAPTION
VENEFRIDA A. DE RIVERA, ET AL. v. FORTUNATO F. HALILI, G.R. No. L-15159, September 30, 1963, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Federico Suntay, owner of fishponds in Bulacan, leased them to Virgilio Ramos, et al. for a four-year term ending October 1, 1955. Suntay also executed a promissory note which provided that failure to pay the debt within three years would consolidate the amount as additional consideration and extend the lease. Without Suntay’s consent, Ramos, et al. assigned their lease rights to defendant Fortunato Halili.

On September 28, 1955, Suntay leased the same fishponds to plaintiffs De Rivera, et al. for a period beginning October 2, 1955. As Halili refused to vacate, claiming rights under the assignment and promissory note, De Rivera, et al. filed an action for unlawful detainer in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Hagonoy, Bulacan. Simultaneously, Suntay filed a separate civil case in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon City to declare the original lease, assignment, and promissory note void.

The JP Court ruled in favor of De Rivera, ordering Halili to vacate. Halili appealed to the CFI of Bulacan. The CFI of Bulacan reversed the decision and dismissed the complaint, ruling that the JP Court lacked jurisdiction because the issue involved the validity of the documents (lease and assignment), which is a matter incapable of pecuniary estimation and cognizable only by the CFI. De Rivera, et al. appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Justice of the Peace Court had jurisdiction over the unlawful detainer case given that the defense raised the validity of the lease and assignment documents.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. The disagreement extended beyond the simple issue of who was entitled to physical possession; it required the court to rule on the validity or nullity of the deeds of lease, the deed of assignment, and the promissory note upon which the parties predicated their claims. Consequently, the case was converted from a mere detainer suit to one "incapable of pecuniary estimation." Under the Judiciary Act of 1948, civil actions incapable of pecuniary estimation fall within the original jurisdiction of the CFI, not the JP Court.

Since the JP Court lacked original jurisdiction, the CFI could not exercise appellate jurisdiction. Under Rule 40, Section 11 of the Rules of Court, a CFI may only try a case on the merits in its original jurisdiction if the parties file pleadings and go to trial without objection. Here, the jurisdiction was precisely objected to. The Court further noted that the plaintiffs' proper remedy was to institute an action against the lessor, Suntay, under Article 1654 of the Civil Code for failing to deliver the lease object in a fit condition and maintain the lessee in peaceful enjoyment.

The judgment appealed from is hereby **AFFIRMED**.
