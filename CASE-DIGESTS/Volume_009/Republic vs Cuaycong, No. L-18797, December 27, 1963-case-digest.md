**I. CAPTION**
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CLARITA CUAYCONG and EULALIO LACSON, JR., G.R. No. L-18797, December 27, 1963, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
The Republic of the Philippines, having taken over the assets of the Bank of Taiwan, filed a collection suit in the Justice of the Peace Court of Victorias, Negros Occidental against Clarita Cuaycong and Eulalio Lacson, Jr. The suit sought to collect a loan evidenced by eight promissory notes and a chattel mortgage on standing crops, executed between 1943 and 1944. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of improper venue and prescription, arguing that the documents were executed in Bacolod City, not Victorias. The Justice of the Peace Court dismissed the case. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental affirmed the dismissal, finding that the promissory notes and chattel mortgage were all dated in Bacolod City, making venue improperly laid in Victorias. The Republic appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that since the place of execution did not appear on the promissory notes, the action was properly filed in Victorias where the defendant resides [1-5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the venue was properly laid in the Justice of the Peace Court of Victorias.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the venue was improperly laid in Victorias and should have been in Bacolod City. The Court found that the entire agreement was embodied not just in the promissory notes, but principally in the chattel mortgage, which contained the main stipulations and was expressly dated at Bacolod City [6]. Furthermore, the Republic's own complaint averred that the loans were obtained at the Bank of Taiwan's offices in Bacolod City [7]. Where the written agreements evidencing the loan are executed or expressly dated at a certain place, the venue for their enforcement is in that place [6].

**Petition denied; Order affirmed.**
