I. CAPTION
ARSENIO N. SALCEDO v. THE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL OF CANDELARIA, QUEZON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18714, October 31, 1963, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Arsenio N. Salcedo, the Chief of Police of Candelaria, Quezon, faced an administrative complaint filed by the Municipal Mayor on July 10, 1960, for misconduct and irregularities under Republic Act No. 557 [1, 2]. Salcedo objected to the complaint because it was not sworn to, but the Municipal Council overruled his objection [2]. The Mayor suspended Salcedo, and upon the expiration of the 60-day suspension period, the Council passed a resolution extending his suspension indefinitely until the investigation was concluded [2, 3]. Salcedo moved to disqualify the Council members for bias, claiming he had filed administrative charges against them, but this was also denied [4].

Salcedo filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus with the Court of First Instance of Quezon, questioning the validity of the unsworn complaint, the indefinite suspension, and the refusal of the Council members to disqualify themselves [5, 6]. The lower court dismissed the petition on the ground of failure to exhaust administrative remedies, ruling that under R.A. No. 557, Salcedo should have appealed the Council's actions to the Commissioner of Civil Service [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court correctly dismissed the petition for failure to exhaust administrative remedies regarding the Municipal Council's interlocutory orders.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial judge misconstrued the law. Under Sections 1 and 2 of Republic Act No. 557, the "decision" of the Municipal Council that is appealable to the Commissioner of Civil Service is the one having to do with the **merits** of the administrative charges after a proper hearing [8, 9].

In this case, the administrative investigation had not even commenced, and no decision on the merits had been rendered [10]. The Council's rulings on the lack of oath, disqualification, and extension of suspension were interlocutory and not the "decisions" contemplated by the statute for appeal to the Commissioner [9]. Therefore, the principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies did not apply. The lower court should have taken cognizance of the petition to resolve the legal issues raised, particularly the legality of extending the suspension beyond the 60-day period [10].

The Order of the lower court is SET ASIDE, and the case is REMANDED to the court of origin for further appropriate proceedings [11].
