**I. CAPTION**
GAUDIOSO M. TIONGCO v. CARMELO L. PORRAS, G.R. No. L-16452, October 31, 1963, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Gaudioso Tiongco and Carmelo Porras were candidates for Mayor of Davao City in the November 1955 elections. Porras was proclaimed the winner. Tiongco filed an election protest (Case No. 79) in the Court of First Instance of Davao alleging fraud, to which Porras responded with a counter-protest covering 41 precincts [1]. Porras paid P1,230.00 in fees to the commissioners for the revision of ballots in the counter-protested precincts and posted a bond with a premium of P180.00 [2, 3].

After a delay of over two years due to Tiongco's postponements, the trial court dismissed the case and the counter-protest, awarding costs against Tiongco [4]. Porras filed a bill of costs including the commissioners' fees and bond premium, which the Clerk of Court approved and the trial court affirmed [3]. Tiongco appealed, arguing there is no law authorizing the award of these specific expenses as costs [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the protestant is liable for the costs of commissioners' fees and bond premiums incurred by the protestee in the counter-protest.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. The Court ruled that under Section 180 of the Revised Election Code, a protestant must file a bond to answer for "all expenses and costs incidental to the protest" [3]. The fees paid to commissioners for revising ballots are expenses incidental to the protest because the allegations made the opening of ballot boxes inevitable [3].

Regarding the costs related specifically to the counter-protest, the Court held that the counter-protest was "forced upon appellee by appellant’s protest" and must be viewed as a defense [5]. Consequently, the expenses incurred in connection with the counter-protest, including the commissioners' fees and bond premiums, arose from and were deemed "mere incident[s] of appellant’s protest" for which the protestant is liable [5].

The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs [6].
