**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JACINTO RICAPLAZA @ TOTING RICAPLAZA, G.R. No. L-25856, April 29, 1968, Angeles, J.

**II. FACTS**
On June 18, 1962, around 7:00 P.M. in Padidu, Glan, Cotabato, Francisco Poncardas was killed in his home during a robbery. Appellant Jacinto Ricaplaza entered the house, pointed a pistol at the victim, and demanded money. When Poncardas attempted to grapple for the gun, Ricaplaza shot him. The robbers fled with a shotgun, jewelry, and a radio. Prosecution witnesses Lucia Ferolino and Josefina Bigapria, both 12-year-old dependents of the victim, positively identified Ricaplaza, having served him meals when he stayed at the house a month prior. Ricaplaza interposed the defense of alibi, claiming he was catching pigs at a fishpond in Balangonan, Davao, and presented confessions of third parties (Fernandez and Arzula) who admitted to the crime without implicating him. The Court of First Instance of Cotabato found Ricaplaza guilty of robbery with homicide and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the identification by the child witnesses is credible despite their relationship to the victim.
2. W/N the defense of alibi should prevail over positive identification.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court held that children generally have good and retentive memories, and it is unlikely they would forget the appellant's face after only one month, especially since they had previous interactions with him [1, 2]. Relationship to the victim does not render clear and positive testimony less worthy of credit, provided no improper motive is shown [1, 3]. Furthermore, the witness's spontaneous declaration identifying the appellant immediately after the startling occurrence was admissible as part of the *res gestae* [4, 5].

2. **NO.** Alibi is the weakest defense and must be rejected when the accused is positively identified by eyewitnesses [6, 7]. To prosper, the defense must prove it was physically impossible to be at the crime scene; here, evidence showed the distance could be traveled in 1.5 hours [8, 9]. Additionally, the Court noted that Ricaplaza's failure to pay respects to his "beloved" uncle or condole with the family was behavior inconsistent with innocence and betrayed a guilty conscience [10, 11]. The third-party confessions were disregarded as they were found to be involuntary and obtained through pressure [12].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED**.
