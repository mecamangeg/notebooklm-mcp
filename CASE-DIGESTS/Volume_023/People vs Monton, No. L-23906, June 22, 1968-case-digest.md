I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JULIAN MONTON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23906, June 22, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On May 15, 1957, a complaint for libel was filed in the Justice of the Peace Court of Miagao, Iloilo against the defendants for sending a communication to the President denouncing the City Fiscal of Iloilo [1]. The Justice of the Peace dismissed the complaint for lack of probable cause [1]. On May 8, 1958, the Provincial Fiscal filed a new information for the same crime in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo [2]. The accused moved to quash the information, arguing, among other grounds, the lack of preliminary investigation [2]. After a remand from the Supreme Court on a separate issue, the trial court held a hearing and found that no valid preliminary investigation was conducted by the Fiscal, as the complainant’s affidavit did not show personal examination and the Fiscal could not produce records of the investigation [3, 4]. The trial court granted the motion to quash, and the State appealed, arguing that a new investigation was unnecessary and that the Fiscal's certification should suffice [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a new preliminary investigation is required when a fiscal files a new information after the charge was previously dismissed by the Justice of the Peace Court.
2. W/N the Fiscal’s certification that he conducted a preliminary investigation is conclusive despite the absence of supporting records.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that when a complaint is dismissed after a preliminary investigation and a new information is filed, the accused cannot be brought to trial unless another preliminary investigation is made of the crime charged in the new information [5]. This right is substantial, and its denial subjects the accused to loss of liberty without due process of law (*Conde v. Judge of CFI of Tayabas*) [5]. While the Fiscal has discretion to institute action, he cannot dispense with the preliminary investigation, which is intended to protect the accused from hasty and oppressive prosecution [6, 7].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the authority of the Fiscal to file an information based on his certification presupposes good faith and the actual conduct of an investigation [8]. In this case, the evidence negated the certification: the complainant's affidavit was not subscribed before the Fiscal, it did not show that "searching questions" were asked as required by the Rules of Court, and the Fiscal failed to produce the records of the alleged investigation claiming they were lost [9, 10]. Without convincing evidence that the Fiscal personally conducted the investigation, the certification does not suffice to validly dispense with the right of the accused [11].

The Order of dismissal is affirmed [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
