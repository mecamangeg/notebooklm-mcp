**I. CAPTION**
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR NATURALIZATION OF CHUA BOK, CHUA BOK v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-24286, April 25, 1968, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Chua Bok, a citizen of Nationalist China and a merchant, filed a petition for naturalization on June 24, 1963, in the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental [1]. The petition stated his residence as Sipalay, Negros Occidental, but failed to mention his former places of residence [2]. However, his Alien Certificate of Registration (ACR) and Immigrant Certificate of Residence, as well as his wife’s ACR, showed a previous residence at 492 Nueva St., Manila. Additionally, the ACRs of his children indicated residence at the corner of Smith and Taft, Bacolod City [2].

Regarding his financial capacity, Chua Bok claimed an average annual income of P4,359.28 for the last three years [3]. His income tax returns for 1961, 1962, and 1963 showed net incomes of P2,960.47, P7,228.63, and P4,286.95, respectively [3]. He has a wife and four children, three of whom were already studying [3, 4]. The trial court granted the petition, but the Republic appealed [1, 2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the failure to state former places of residence in the petition is fatal.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The failure to state former places of residence in the petition is fatal [2]. The Court held that the philosophy behind the rule requiring the recital of former places of residence is that information regarding the petitioner and objections to his application are apt to be provided by people in his actual, physical surroundings [2]. The Court cited *Burca v. Republic* and *Ong Chian Suy v. Republic* to support this strict requirement [2].

2. **NO.** The petitioner’s income does not measure up to the standard of lucrative income [4]. With a wife and four children to support (three of whom are studying), net incomes ranging from approximately P2,900 to P7,200 are insufficient [3, 4]. The Court noted that bonuses and meal allowances included in the gross income figures do not figure in the assessment of lucrative income [3].

**WHEREFORE**, the judgment under review is reversed, and the petition for naturalization is denied [4].
