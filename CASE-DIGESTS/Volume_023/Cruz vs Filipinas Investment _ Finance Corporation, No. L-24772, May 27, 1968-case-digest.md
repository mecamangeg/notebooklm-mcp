I. CAPTION
RUPERTO G. CRUZ and FELICIDAD VDA. DE REYES v. FILIPINAS INVESTMENT & FINANCE CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-24772, May 27, 1968, 23 SCRA 791, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Ruperto Cruz purchased an Isuzu Diesel Bus on installments from Far East Motor Corporation. As security, Cruz executed a chattel mortgage over the bus. Due to the lack of a down payment, Felicidad Vda. de Reyes executed a second real estate mortgage on her land as additional security. Far East assigned its rights to respondent Filipinas Investment & Finance Corporation.

When Cruz defaulted on his payments, the respondent extrajudicially foreclosed the chattel mortgage on the bus. The bus was sold at public auction to the respondent for P15,000, which was less than the outstanding obligation. To recover the deficiency, the respondent initiated the foreclosure of the real estate mortgage posted by Reyes. Cruz and Reyes filed an action to cancel the real estate mortgage, arguing that the foreclosure of the chattel mortgage barred further recovery. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Cruz and Reyes, ordering the cancellation of the real estate mortgage [1-9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the vendor-assignee, after extrajudicially foreclosing the chattel mortgage on the personal property sold on installments, can legally foreclose a real estate mortgage constituted by a third party as additional security for the unpaid balance.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that under Article 1484 of the Civil Code, the vendor has three alternative, not cumulative, remedies in case of default: (1) exact fulfillment, (2) cancel the sale, or (3) foreclose the chattel mortgage. The law expressly states that if the vendor chooses to foreclose the chattel mortgage, they "shall have no further action against the purchaser to recover any unpaid balance" [10, 11].

The Court rejected the argument that the restriction applies only to the purchaser and not to a third-party mortgagor. If the third-party guarantor (Reyes) were compelled to pay the balance, she would be entitled to recover from the debtor-vendee (Cruz) under Article 2066 of the Civil Code. This would ultimately make the vendee liable for the deficiency, indirectly subverting the protection and public policy of Article 1484 [12].

Furthermore, the Court held that the term "action" in Article 1484 includes extrajudicial proceedings, such as the foreclosure of a real estate mortgage, used to exact recovery of the unsatisfied balance [13, 14].

The decision was **MODIFIED** only to order Reyes to reimburse the respondent for the amount it paid to the Development Bank of the Philippines to release the first mortgage on her land, as she benefited from said payment. In all other respects, the judgment cancelling the real estate mortgage was affirmed [15].
