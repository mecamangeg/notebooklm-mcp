I. CAPTION
UNA KIBAD v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF TUBARAN, LANAO DEL SUR, and ABDULMADID MARUHOM PANONDIONGAN, G.R. No. L-28469, May 7, 1968, 23 SCRA 588, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Una Kibad, the Liberal Party candidate for Mayor of Tubaran, Lanao del Sur in the November 14, 1967 elections, sought to annul the canvass of votes. He prayed for the exclusion of election returns from Precincts 10, 11, 12, and 13, alleging they were "manufactured" and vitiated by fraud and terrorism [1]. Kibad cited *Lagumbay v. COMELEC*, pointing to an alleged excess of votes counted over votes cast for certain positions (e.g., 1,398 excess votes for councilors in Precinct 12) [2]. Additionally, he challenged the validity of the counting because it was conducted at the PC barracks in a different municipality (Lumbatan) three days after the election [3]. Respondent COMELEC and the Nacionalista Party candidate, Abdulmadid Maruhom Panondiongan, opposed the petition, noting that no candidate received zero votes in the questioned precincts, distinguishing the case from *Lagumbay* [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the election returns should be rejected as "obviously manufactured" under the *Lagumbay* doctrine.
2. W/N the transfer of ballot boxes and counting of votes in the PC barracks of a different municipality invalidates the proceedings.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The *Lagumbay* doctrine is not applicable. The Court ruled that for returns to be rejected as "obviously manufactured," there must be a uniformity of tallies where one party garners all votes while the opposing party receives exactly zero [5]. In this case, no candidate obtained a zero vote [4]. The Court emphasized that *Lagumbay* must be viewed restrictively to prevent the disenfranchisement of innocent voters [6]. Statistical improbabilities alone, without the "systematic blanking" of the opposing party, are insufficient to warrant the summary rejection of returns [7].

2. **NO.** The Court held that external circumstances, such as threats of violence or "political passions running rife," may compel the transfer of ballot boxes to places of safety to avoid the frustration of the popular will [3]. It would be unrealistic to deny COMELEC the authority to safeguard the ascertaining of results free from pressure or bloodshed. Citing *Alonto v. COMELEC*, the Court affirmed that requiring officials to stick to their posts in the face of imminent violence is "extreme idolatry of the letter of the law" [3].

The restraining order is lifted and the petition for mandamus is **DENIED** [8].
