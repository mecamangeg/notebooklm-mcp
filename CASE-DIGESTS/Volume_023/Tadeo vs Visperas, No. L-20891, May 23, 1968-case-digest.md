I. CAPTION
TOMAS B. TADEO v. ROMULO VISPERAS, Justice of the Peace of Mangaldan, Pangasinan, LEONCIO MAICON and EMILIA ACOSTA, G.R. No. L-20891, May 23, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On April 30, 1957, a criminal complaint for *estafa* was filed against petitioner Tomas Tadeo before the Justice of the Peace (JP) of Mangaldan, Pangasinan. It was alleged that on March 27, 1948, Tadeo deceived complainants Maicon and Acosta into signing a deed of sale instead of a deed of partition, and subsequently sold the land for P700.00 [1].

Respondent JP Visperas conducted the first stage of the preliminary investigation, found probable cause, and issued a warrant of arrest [2]. After posting bail, Tadeo moved for a reinvestigation during the second stage, seeking to recall and cross-examine the complainants. His objective was to prove the land's value was only P400.00 to P700.00, which would lower the penalty and establish that the crime had already prescribed [2, 3]. The JP denied the motion for reinvestigation and a subsequent request to file a motion to quash, viewing them as dilatory tactics [2].

Tadeo filed a petition for *certiorari* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan, alleging grave abuse of discretion. The CFI dismissed the petition [2]. Tadeo appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused has a right to confront and cross-examine witnesses during the first stage of the preliminary investigation (preliminary examination).
2. W/N the crime of *estafa* had prescribed based on the alleged lower value of the property.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the respondent JP committed no abuse of discretion in refusing to reopen the preliminary examination. It is a settled rule that it is not a matter of right for the accused to confront witnesses against him during the preliminary examination prior to the issuance of a warrant of arrest [3, 5]. The accused cannot demand that the complainant and witnesses repeat their testimony in his presence at this stage [6]. Granting the privilege to cross-examine during the first stage is purely discretionary for the Justice of the Peace [3]. The petitioner was afforded the opportunity to present evidence in his favor during the second stage of the preliminary investigation [3].

2. **NO.** Even assuming the value of the land was only P400.00, the crime had not prescribed. Under Paragraph 3, Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for *estafa* involving such amount is a compound penalty: *arresto mayor* in its maximum period to *prisión correccional* in its minimum period [7]. Under Article 90 of the same Code, when the penalty is compound, the higher penalty determines the prescriptive period. Since the higher penalty is *correctional*, the crime prescribes in ten years [7]. The crime was allegedly committed on March 27, 1948, and the complaint was filed on April 30, 1957; thus, only 9 years, 1 month, and 3 days had elapsed [7].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
