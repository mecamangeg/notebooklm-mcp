I. CAPTION
SWITZERLAND GENERAL INSURANCE CO., LTD. v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and MANILA PORT SERVICE, G.R. No. L-22150, April 22, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Laguna Trading imported 6,758 bags of wheat flour from Canada, insured by Switzerland General Insurance Co., Ltd. On April 13, 1961, the vessel "SS Sunnyville" arrived in Manila and began discharging the goods to the Manila Port Service (arrastre operator). On the same day, April 13, the consignee filed a provisional claim with the arrastre operator [1]. The discharge of the last package from the vessel was completed two days later, on April 15, 1961 [1].

Upon delivery, 248 bags were missing. The insurer paid the consignee and filed suit as subrogee against the defendants. The City Court of Manila and the Court of First Instance ruled in favor of the insurer [2]. The defendants appealed, arguing that the provisional claim was invalid under Section 15 of the management contract because it was filed before the discharge of the last package [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the provisional claim filed before the date of the discharge of the last package constitutes substantial compliance with the management contract.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, ruling that a provisional claim filed prior to the discharge of the last package is generally premature and speculative [4].

The Court applied the doctrine from *New Hampshire Fire Insurance Co. v. Manila Port Service*, which distinguishes between two situations: (1) where a claim is filed early and the consignee has not yet examined or been informed of the shipment's condition (speculative/premature), and (2) where the claim is filed early but the consignee has in fact already discovered or been informed of the shortage (valid) [4]. In this case, the claim was filed on April 13, while the last package was discharged on April 15. Since there was no evidence that the consignee had actual knowledge of the shortage when the claim was filed, it was deemed premature and speculative [5].

The decision appealed from is reversed, and the complaint is dismissed [5].
