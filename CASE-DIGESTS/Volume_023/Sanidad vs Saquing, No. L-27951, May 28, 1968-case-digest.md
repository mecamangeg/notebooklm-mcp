I. CAPTION
PABLO C. SANIDAD v. HON. CRESCENCIANO L. SAQUING and LUCAS V. CAUTON, G.R. No. L-27951, May 28, 1968, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Sanidad sought the implementation of a Supreme Court directive requiring Respondent Judge Saquing of the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur to recount votes in 122 precincts [1]. The ballot boxes for these precincts were in the custody of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) in Manila [2]. Sanidad filed a petition requesting that the recount be conducted at the COMELEC offices in Manila rather than in the judge's territorial jurisdiction in Candon, Ilocos Sur [1, 2]. This request was based on the risks of loss during transport, security concerns in Candon, and the need for an environment with "lesser political tension and passion" [2]. The procedural hurdle was whether a judge could exercise his authority under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code outside his designated district [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a Court of First Instance Judge may conduct a judicial recount under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code outside his territorial jurisdiction.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that Section 163 of the Revised Election Code confers upon a judge a "special authority" to recount votes, which is a duty separate and apart from the general jurisdiction defined in the Judiciary Act of 1948 [4-6]. This function is merely a step in the election process leading to proclamation and does not involve a decision in a judicial controversy or a contest [4, 7].

The Court reasoned that even in regular judicial functions, judges may act outside their territory, such as in cases of replevin where property is moved, or under Section 51 of the Judiciary Act regarding the signing of decisions [8, 9]. Given that the ballot boxes were already in Manila for safekeeping, and that a recount in Manila would avoid transport risks and ensure a venue with "lesser political tension," the Court found it proper to authorize the recount outside the district [2].

The motion was **GRANTED**, and the Respondent Judge was ordered to proceed with the recount at the offices of the Commission on Elections in Manila [10].
