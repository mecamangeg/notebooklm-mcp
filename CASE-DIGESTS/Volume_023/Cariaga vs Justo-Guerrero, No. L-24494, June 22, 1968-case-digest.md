I. CAPTION
JULIA D. CARIAGA v. THE HONORABLE MARIA JUSTO-GUERRERO and THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-24494, June 22, 1968, 23 SCRA 1061, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On April 27, 1964, several teachers filed a criminal complaint for grave slander against petitioner Julia Cariaga in the Municipal Court of Pasuquin, Ilocos Norte, presided by respondent Judge Maria Justo-Guerrero. The complaint stemmed from defamatory remarks Cariaga allegedly made during a school meeting on April 8, 1964. Upon arraignment on May 13, 1964, it was discovered that an "Information" charging the same offense, sworn to on April 15, 1964, was already in the records. It appeared that prior to the formal filing, the respondent Judge had heard verbal complaints, received the "Information" informally to aid in extrajudicial settlement, and allowed its withdrawal when settlement failed. Cariaga moved to quash the case on the grounds of double jeopardy and lack of jurisdiction. The Judge denied the motion. Cariaga then filed a petition for prohibition with the Supreme Court, arguing that the Judge's prior informal participation showed bias and that the court lacked jurisdiction over the offense and the proceedings due to the absence of the fiscal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent Judge should be prohibited from hearing the case due to bias arising from her participation in the preliminary settlement attempts.
2. W/N the Municipal Court has jurisdiction over the crime of grave slander.
3. W/N the failure of the fiscal to intervene affects the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** While the respondent Judge's actuations—informally receiving the "Information" and allowing its withdrawal to facilitate settlement—generated suspicion of bias and should have been avoided, they do not constitute sufficient ground for her to inhibit from trying the case. The Supreme Court clarified that there was only one case filed (the "Complaint" with a docket number); the "Information" was merely a supporting paper, thus no double jeopardy attached.

2. **YES.** Under Republic Act No. 3828, which took effect on June 22, 1963, the original jurisdiction of municipal courts was increased to cover all offenses punishable by imprisonment for not more than three years (except election law violations). Grave slander, defined under Art. 358 of the Revised Penal Code, is punishable by *arresto mayor* maximum to *prision correccional* minimum (6 months and 1 day to 2 years and 4 months). This penalty falls within the expanded jurisdiction of the municipal court.

3. **NO.** The failure to cite the fiscal or any of his deputies to intervene in the case does not affect the jurisdiction of the municipal court (*Valdez v. Director of Prisons*, 38 Phil. 596). However, the prosecution must legally be with the participation of said officials; thus, the municipal court should cite the fiscal to intervene (*Trinidad v. Jarabe*, 3 Phil. 518).

The petition is **DISMISSED**, and the respondent court is directed to continue with the case upon notice to the fiscal.
