I. CAPTION
SERAFIN TIJAM, ET AL. v. MAGDALENO SIBONGHANOY, ET AL. and MANILA SURETY AND FIDELITY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-21450, April 15, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On July 19, 1948, Spouses Serafin Tijam and Felicitas Tagalog filed a civil case in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu against Spouses Magdaleno Sibonghanoy and Lucia Baguio to recover the sum of P1,908.00 plus interest [1]. A writ of attachment was issued but was dissolved after Manila Surety and Fidelity Co., Inc. (Surety) filed a counter-bond [1]. The CFI rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs [2]. After the writ of execution against the defendants was returned unsatisfied, the plaintiffs moved for execution against the Surety's bond [2]. The Surety opposed the motion and sought affirmative relief to be relieved of liability, but the CFI granted the execution [3].

The Surety appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the CFI's orders [4, 5]. Five days after receiving the CA decision, the Surety filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing for the first time that the CFI lacked jurisdiction because under the Judiciary Act of 1948 (which took effect a month before the case was filed), claims under P2,000.00 fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of inferior courts [5]. The CA certified the case to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Surety is barred by laches from raising the question of lack of jurisdiction for the first time after 15 years of active participation in the case.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Although the general rule is that jurisdiction over the subject matter is conferred by law and may be raised at any stage of the proceedings, the Surety is barred by *laches* from invoking this plea after an unreasonable length of time [6, 7]. Laches is defined as the "failure or neglect, for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do that which, by exercising due diligence, could or should have been done earlier" [8, 9].

The Surety became a quasi-party to the case in 1948 and actively participated in the proceedings for 15 years, invoking the court's jurisdiction to secure affirmative relief [10, 11]. The Supreme Court held that it is "not right for a party who has affirmed and invoked the jurisdiction of a court in a particular matter to secure an affirmative relief, to afterwards deny that same jurisdiction to escape a penalty" [12]. To sanction such conduct would be an "undesirable practice" and would result in patent inequity and unfairness by annulling years of proceedings [13, 14].

Orders affirmed [15].
