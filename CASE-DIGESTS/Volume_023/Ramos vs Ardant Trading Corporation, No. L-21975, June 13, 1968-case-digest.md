I. CAPTION
MANUEL C. RAMOS v. ARDANT TRADING CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-21975, June 13, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On November 28, 1962, plaintiff Manuel C. Ramos filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Davao (Civil Case No. 3890) against defendant Ardant Trading Corporation to recover salaries and damages for his alleged arbitrary dismissal. Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the Department of Labor had jurisdiction over the claim under Republic Act No. 1052 and that the matter was already pending before said Department. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss as well as the subsequent motion for reconsideration. Consequently, the defendant immediately filed an appeal to the Supreme Court challenging the order denying the motion to dismiss.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an order denying a motion to dismiss is appealable.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal for being premature. The Court ruled that orders denying a defendant's motion to dismiss and motion for reconsideration are **interlocutory** in nature, not final. Under **Section 2, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court**, "Only final judgments or orders shall be subject to appeal." Interlocutory orders cannot be the subject of appeal until a final judgment is rendered on the merits of the case. This principle is a well-established rule of practice intended to avoid multiplicity of appeals.

The appeal was dismissed with treble costs against the defendant-appellant and its counsel jointly and severally.
