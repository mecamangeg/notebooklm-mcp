I. CAPTION
SURIGAO CONSOLIDATED MINING COMPANY, INC. v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and CLETO TUIBUEN, G.R. No. L-26077, May 27, 1968, 23 SCRA 820, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Cleto Tuibuen worked as a rustler jigger for petitioner Surigao Consolidated Mining. On March 6, 1954, a blast inside a tunnel caused a wooden splinter to hit Tuibuen, resulting in impaired hearing [1]. Petitioner’s safety engineer, T.B. Fuderanan, knew of the accident immediately [1]. Tuibuen was treated but eventually laid off on May 18, 1954, due to his condition [1]. He filed a claim for compensation six years later, on November 23, 1960 [2].

Petitioner controverted the claim only on February 3, 1961, arguing it was barred by the statute of limitations under Section 24 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act (Act 3428), which requires notice and filing within a specific short period [2]. The Acting Referee dismissed the claim on grounds of prescription [3]. However, the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed this, ordering petitioner to pay P2,243.70 in compensation, ruling that the delay was excusable because the petitioner failed to controvert the claim within the statutory period despite knowledge of the accident [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent’s claim for compensation is barred by prescription or failure to file a notice of injury within the time prescribed by Section 24 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the WCC decision. The Court held that the failure of an employee to comply with the notice and claim requirements of Section 24 of Act 3428 is non-jurisdictional [6]. Failure or delay in giving notice is not a bar to a claim if the employer or its agent had knowledge of the injury, or if the employer failed to controvert the right to compensation within 14 days of disability or 10 days of knowledge of the accident [6]. Here, the petitioner's safety engineer knew of the accident, yet the petitioner failed to file a timely controversion, thereby renouncing its right to challenge the claim [5, 7].

Furthermore, regarding the six-year delay in filing, the Court applied *National Development Company v. Rongavilla*, ruling that the liability to pay compensation is an obligation created by law. Under Article 1144(2) of the Civil Code, actions to enforce such obligations prescribe in ten (10) years from the time the right of action accrues [8]. Thus, the claim filed six years after the accident was well within the prescriptive period.

Petition dismissed; decision and resolution affirmed [9].
