I. CAPTION
**JOSE MANUEL LEZAMA and PAQUITA LEZAMA v. HON. JESUS RODRIGUEZ, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, JOSE DINEROS, in his capacity as Receiver of the LA PAZ ICE PLANT & COLD STORAGE Co., INC., and THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS**, G.R. No. L-25643, June 27, 1968, 23 SCRA 1166, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Jose Dineros, acting as receiver of the La Paz Ice Plant & Cold Storage Co., filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo to annul a judgment rendered by the CFI of Manila. The complaint named the spouses Jose Manuel Lezama (President) and Paquita Lezama (Secretary) as co-defendants. Dineros alleged that the spouses mismanaged the corporation and colluded with a third party, Marciano Roque, to allow Roque to obtain a default judgment against the company for a fictitious loan of P150,000.

During the trial, Dineros requested a subpoena to compel Paquita Lezama to testify as a hostile witness under Rule 132, Section 6 (Direct examination of unwilling or hostile witnesses). The petitioners objected, invoking Rule 130, Section 20(b), which prohibits a spouse from testifying for or against the other without consent. Judge Rodriguez granted the motion and required Paquita to testify. The Court of Appeals dismissed the petitioners' subsequent petition for certiorari.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a wife, who is a co-defendant with her husband in a suit charging them with fraud, may be compelled to testify as a hostile witness for the adverse party without violating the marital privilege rule.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower courts. The Court held that compelling the wife to testify would violate Rule 130, Section 20(b) of the Rules of Court, which provides that a husband cannot be examined for or against his wife without her consent, nor a wife for or against her husband without his consent.

The Court explained that this rule is grounded on the "natural repugnance" of compelling a spouse to be the means of the other's condemnation. While Rule 132, Section 6 allows the examination of an adverse party as a witness, it is merely a concession for discovery and cannot override the fundamental marital privilege. In this case, the charge was "fraudulent conspiracy" between the spouses. The interests of the husband and wife were inextricably interrelated; therefore, Paquita's testimony regarding her participation in the alleged fraud (signing minutes and book entries) would inevitably pit her against her husband and could be used to support the charge of collusion against him. The exception allowing spousal testimony applies only when the spouses have separate interests or are formal parties, which was not the case here.

The resolutions were **REVERSED** and the case was **REMANDED** to the court of origin.
