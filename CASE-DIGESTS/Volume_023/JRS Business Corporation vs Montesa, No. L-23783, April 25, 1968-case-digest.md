I. CAPTION
JRS BUSINESS CORPORATION and JOSE R. DA SILVA v. THE HON. AGUSTIN P. MONTESA, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, and THE IMPERIAL INSURANCE, INC., G.R. No. L-23783, April 25, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
This case stems from a 1964 Supreme Court decision (*JRS Business Corp. v. Imperial Insurance*, L-19891) which set aside the execution sale of petitioner JRS Business Corporation's franchise, trade name, and capital stocks to respondent Imperial Insurance, Inc. [1-3]. After the 1964 decision became final, petitioners filed a motion with the lower court, presided by Judge Montesa, for the immediate restitution of said properties [4, 5]. Judge Montesa ordered the Sheriff to strictly conform to the Supreme Court decision but denied the motion for restitution for lack of merit [4, 5]. Respondents argued that Imperial Insurance never took physical possession of the franchise, trade name, or capital stocks—as JRS remained in possession—and that it only purchased petitioner Da Silva's rights and interests in the corporation [6, 7]. Petitioners Da Silva and JRS (though JRS later joined the respondents' answer under new management) filed this petition for mandamus, alleging the Judge's refusal to order restitution was a neglect of duty [6, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the writ of mandamus lies to compel the trial judge to order the restitution of the properties.

IV. RULING
**NO**. Mandamus is only proper when there is neglect of a specific legal duty or unlawful exclusion from the use of a right, and such legal rights must be "clear and certain" [9, 10]. The Court held that the respondent Judge had already performed his duty by issuing an order directing the Sheriff to strictly follow the 1964 Supreme Court decision [4, 6]. Furthermore, since the respondents claimed they never took actual possession of the specific excluded items (franchise, trade name, capital stocks), the petitioners' right to restitution was not well-defined or clear [7, 9]. Citing *Viuda e Hijos de Crispulo Zamora v. Wright*, the Court emphasized that mandamus does not issue in doubtful cases [10, 11].

The petition for mandamus is denied [12].
