I. CAPTION
PROCTER & GAMBLE PHILIPPINE MANUFACTURING CORPORATION v. COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-24173, May 23, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Procter & Gamble sought a refund of P1,434.00 paid as wharfage dues on three shipments of palm oil and coconut fatty alcohol. These shipments were unloaded directly at the petitioner’s private wharf [1]. The Commissioner of Customs denied the claim. On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals affirmed the Commissioner's decision [1]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that under the Tariff and Customs Code (R.A. 1937), wharfage dues are not collectible when goods are unloaded at private wharves, and that even if they were, the petitioner is exempt from payment under Republic Act No. 901 as a new and necessary industry [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N wharfage dues are collectible under R.A. No. 1937 on goods unloaded at private wharves.
2. W/N wharfage dues are covered by the tax exemption granted to new and necessary industries under R.A. No. 901.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court reiterated its ruling in a previous case involving the same parties (*L-22819*) that wharfage dues are collectible even if goods are unloaded at a private wharf [2]. Wharfage dues are assessed against the cargo discharged by a vessel engaged in foreign trade based on quantity, weight, or measure, and not as rental for the use of a government wharf [3]. The dues form a special "Port Works Fund" for the maintenance and improvement of port facilities [4]. Since the vessels and cargoes benefit from the safety and facilities afforded by the port harbor maintained by the government, they must contribute to its cost in the form of wharfage dues, regardless of the specific wharf used for unloading [3, 5].

2. **NO.** The exemption under R.A. No. 901 applies only to "internal revenue" taxes that are "directly payable" by the industry [6]. The Constitution and the Tariff and Customs Code distinguish "wharfage dues" from "taxes" and "customs duties" [7, 8]. Wharfage dues are classified as fees and charges, not taxes [8]. Furthermore, even if considered a levy, they are merely an *indirect* levy because the importation of palm oil and coconut fatty alcohol, while necessary, is not indispensable to the petitioner's industry (i.e., materials could be sourced otherwise) [9]. Thus, they do not fall within the scope of the tax exemption.

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED [10].
