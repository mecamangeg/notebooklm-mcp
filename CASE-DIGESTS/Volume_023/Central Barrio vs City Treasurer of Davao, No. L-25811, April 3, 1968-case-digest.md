**I. CAPTION**
**THE CENTRAL (POBLACION) BARRIO, CITY OF DAVAO, represented by its BARRIO CAPTAIN, HONORIO B. GARCIA v. CITY TREASURER, MAXIMO ASISTIDO, THE HON. CITY COUNCIL, THE HON. CITY AUDITOR, ATTY. FELIX PEPITO and the HON. CITY MAYOR, CARMELO PORRAS**, G.R. No. L-25811, April 3, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Barrio Central (also known as Poblacion) in Davao City claimed a 10% share of real estate taxes collected within its jurisdiction under R.A. 3590 [1]. The City Treasurer refused to release the funds, arguing that the boundaries of Barrio Central, relative to Barrios Agdao and Bucana, were not fixed, making it impossible to determine the specific amount due [1, 2]. On December 2, 1964, Barrio Central filed a petition for declaratory relief with mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao to compel payment and question the creation of the other barrios [3].

During the pendency of the case, Congress enacted R.A. 4354 on June 19, 1965, amending the Charter of Davao City [4]. On August 2, 1965, the CFI dismissed the petition on the ground that the passage of R.A. 4354 rendered the issues academic [4]. Petitioner appealed the dismissal [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the lower court correctly dismissed the petition as academic due to the passage of R.A. 4354.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. Section 2 of R.A. 4354 enumerated the barrios comprising the City of Davao, and Barrio Central (Poblacion) was not included in this list [4]. Applying the statutory construction principle of *Expressio unius est exclusio alterius* (the express mention of one thing implies the exclusion of others), the Court held that the non-inclusion *prima facie* leads to the conclusion that the law abolished Barrio Central as part of Davao City [4, 5].

Since the power to create or abolish municipal corporations resides in Congress, R.A. 4354 is presumed constitutional until squarely challenged [4]. As the petitioner did not amend its pleadings to question the validity of the new law, the barrio was deemed legally non-existent under the new Charter. A non-existent barrio cannot maintain a claim for tax shares against the city [4].

The order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED**.
