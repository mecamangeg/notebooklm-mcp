**I. CAPTION**
USO DAN AGUAM v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS and ALIM BALINDONG, G.R. No. L-28955, May 28, 1968, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
In the November 1967 elections for Mayor of Ganassi, Lanao del Sur, petitioner Uso Dan Aguam and respondent Alim Balindong were rival candidates [1]. On November 20, 1967, the Board of Canvassers proclaimed Aguam as Mayor-elect with 575 votes against Balindong’s 572, a margin of only three votes [1]. The minutes of the canvass revealed that the Board used "Advanced Election Returns" rather than the authentic copies required by law [2]. Balindong filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) on November 21 to restrain the canvass, alleging fraud and tampering of returns in Precinct 8, but the CFI dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction on December 21, 1967 [3]. Meanwhile, Aguam assumed office on December 30, 1967 [4].

On January 6, 1968, Balindong filed a petition with the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to annul the canvass and proclamation and to open the ballot box of Precinct 8, alleging tampering and that the canvass was based on advanced returns [4]. COMELEC issued a resolution on April 27, 1968, asserting its jurisdiction to investigate and open the ballot box [5]. Aguam filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition, arguing that COMELEC lost jurisdiction after his proclamation and assumption of office, and that Balindong’s petition was barred by laches [5, 6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N COMELEC has jurisdiction to annul a canvass and proclamation after the candidate has assumed office.
2. W/N Balindong’s petition before the COMELEC is barred by laches.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The COMELEC has the constitutional mandate to enforce all laws relative to the conduct of elections and to decide all administrative questions affecting them [7]. The Court ruled that COMELEC has the authority to annul any canvass and proclamation illegally made, and the mere fact that a proclaimed candidate has assumed office is no bar to this power [8]. A proclamation based on "advanced copies" of election returns is illegal, as it should be based on the copies for the municipal treasurer or other authentic copies [2]. Where a proclamation is null and void, it is no proclamation at all, and the illegal assumption of office cannot affect the basic issues regarding the validity of the election results [9].

2. **NO.** The election law does not provide a specific time limit within which a candidate may challenge the validity of a proclamation before the COMELEC [10]. While inaction for an unreasonable period may bar a remedy, the Court found no laches in this case [10]. Considering the steps Balindong took—first filing in the CFI immediately after the canvass and then filing with COMELEC shortly after the CFI dismissal—the time gap between the November 20 proclamation and the January 6 petition was not unreasonable [10].

**Petition for certiorari and prohibition denied; preliminary injunction set aside.**
