I. CAPTION
FILIPINO PIPE AND FOUNDRY CORPORATION v. CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-24429, June 22, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On January 5, 1959, the Philippine National Bank established L/C No. 590051 for Filipino Pipe & Foundry Corp. (Filipino Pipe) in the amount of $115,203.19 for the importation of raw materials. On January 27, 1959, the L/C was amended to include a "Centrifugal Cast Iron Pipe Machine or their Accessories" [1, 2]. On July 16, 1959, Republic Act No. 2609 (Margin Law) took effect, imposing a 25% margin fee on foreign exchange sales but exempting contractual obligations outstanding as of that date [2, 3].

Subsequent to the law's effectivity, the L/C was further amended: on August 20, 1959, to require a certificate stating the machine was in good working condition, and on August 24, 1959, to specifically include "foundry equipments" [4, 5]. The Central Bank collected P40,837.59 in margin fees, arguing these post-enactment amendments materially changed the L/C's terms, thus forfeiting the exemption. Filipino Pipe paid under protest and filed suit. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Filipino Pipe, ordering the refund and P8,000.00 in attorney's fees [6, 7]. The Central Bank appealed.

III. ISSUES
1. W/N the amendments to the letter of credit made after the effectivity of the Margin Law materially changed its terms so as to disqualify the importation from exemption under R.A. 2609.
2. W/N the award of attorney's fees against the Central Bank is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled the remittance was exempt under Section 3 of R.A. 2609. This section exempts the liquidation of drafts under L/Cs and contractual obligations outstanding as of the Act's effectivity (July 16, 1959) if extensions have the "same terms and conditions" as the original obligation [3].

The Court held the amendments did not materially change the terms. The August 20 amendment (certificate of good condition) merely "strengthened the impossibility of salting dollars abroad," aligning with the law's objective to curtail excessive demand on reserves [8]. The August 24 amendment (foundry equipments) covered items like blowers and chains, which were deemed "accessories" to the machine already authorized in the pre-Margin Law amendment of January 27, 1959 [9]. While exemptions are strictly construed, construction must be reasonable; denying exemption here would be unjust [10, 11].

2. **NO.** The Court deleted the award of attorney's fees. Under Article 2208 of the Civil Code, attorney's fees are an exception and require "gross and evident bad faith" by the defendant or other equitable grounds [12, 13]. The Central Bank did not act in bad faith in contesting the complex legal issue. To sentence a litigant to pay the adversary's fees without bad faith penalizes the right to litigate [14, 15].

The decision was **MODIFIED** to eliminate the award of attorney's fees, but affirmed as to the refund [15].
