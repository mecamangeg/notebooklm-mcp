I. CAPTION
DANIEL BULANTE v. CHU LIANTE, CAPITAL INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., et al., G.R. Nos. L-21583 and L-21591–92, May 20, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On April 19, 1955, a collision occurred between a passenger bus operated by petitioner Daniel Bulante and a cargo truck owned by respondent Chu Liante in Barugo, Leyte. The impact killed ten persons and injured seven others [1]. Respondent Chu Liante filed a suit for damages based on *culpa aquiliana*, while the injured passengers and heirs of the deceased filed separate actions for breach of contract of carriage (*culpa contractual*) [1].

The trial court found for Bulante, but the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the decision, giving credence to respondents' version that Bulante's bus driver was negligent. The CA found that the bus was racing another vehicle and failed to yield to the truck, which had reached a narrow culvert first [2-4]. Bulante appealed, questioning the findings of negligence and the award of damages [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the injured passengers are entitled to moral damages for breach of contract of carriage.
2. W/N the heirs of the deceased passengers may recover damages for loss of earning capacity even if not specifically pleaded.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court deleted the award of moral damages to the injured passengers. Under Article 2220 of the Civil Code, in cases of breach of contract of carriage, moral damages may be recovered only where the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith [5]. Bulante was sued on his own account as a party to the contract, not vicariously. Since neither fraud nor bad faith was alleged or proven against him personally—and his driver's gross negligence does not amount to fraud or bad faith of the operator—moral damages cannot be awarded [5].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that damages for loss of earning capacity may be awarded. Although not specifically pleaded, this item is considered included in the prayer for "actual damages" and "just and equitable reliefs" [7]. Article 2206, in relation to Article 1764 of the Civil Code, expressly allows recovery for loss of earning capacity in addition to the indemnity for death, unless the deceased had no earning capacity at the time of death due to permanent physical disability [7].

The petition was **GRANTED IN PART**. The judgment of the Court of Appeals was **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**: the award of moral damages to the injured passengers was eliminated, and the indemnity to Chu Liante for the truck was reduced based on depreciation [8].
