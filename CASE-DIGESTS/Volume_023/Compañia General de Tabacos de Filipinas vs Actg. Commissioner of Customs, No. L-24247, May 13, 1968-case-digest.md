I. CAPTION
**COMPANIA GENERAL DE TABACOS DE FILIPINAS v. ACTING COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS**, G.R. No. L-24247, May 13, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
In June 1961, the vessels *Rita Maersk* and *Effie Maersk* docked at the Bugo pier in the port of Cagayan de Oro. The petitioner, Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas, as agent of the vessels, paid berthing fees amounting to P379.25 assessed by the Collector of Customs. The petitioner protested the collection and sought a refund, arguing that the Bugo pier was privately owned and operated by the Philippine Packing Corporation, and that under Section 2903 of the Tariff and Customs Code, berthing fees are assessable only against vessels docking at government-owned piers. The Collector of Customs, the Commissioner of Customs, and subsequently the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) all denied the claim for refund. The petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a vessel engaged in foreign trade that berths at a privately-owned pier is liable for the payment of berthing fees under the Tariff and Customs Code.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals. The Court held that the government's right to collect berthing charges is not conditioned on the pier being publicly owned. Section 2903 of the Tariff and Customs Code employs the word "pier" without distinction; thus, the nature of ownership should not be read into the law [1].

The Court cited *Luzon Stevedoring Corp. v. Court of Tax Appeals*, ruling that berthing charges are assessed for the use of port facilities and the benefits derived from the government's maintenance of navigable waters, channels, and ports, regardless of the specific ownership of the wharf or pier where the vessel docks [2]. Similar to wharfage dues, berthing charges are in the nature of taxes collected to support government operations in customs affairs and the maintenance of bodies of water [3].

**Decision affirmed.**
