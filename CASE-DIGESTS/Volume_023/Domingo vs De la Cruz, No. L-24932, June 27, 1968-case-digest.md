I. CAPTION
ENRIQUE B. DOMINGO, ET AL. v. MAXIMO DE LA CRUZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-24932, June 27, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs (Domingo et al.) sued defendants for the partition of properties alleged to be conjugal assets [1]. Defendants filed a request for admission regarding the ownership of the lands, which plaintiffs failed to deny under oath [2, 3]. Consequently, defendants moved for summary judgment, which the Court of First Instance of Rizal granted on June 8, 1964 [4]. Plaintiffs were served a copy of the judgment on June 20, 1964 [5]. On October 23, 1964—125 days after learning of the judgment—plaintiffs filed a petition for relief from judgment, alleging fraud in the connivance of one plaintiff and defendants to change counsel [6, 7]. The trial court denied the petition for being filed beyond the reglementary period [5]. Plaintiff Domingo appealed, arguing that a motion for reconsideration filed on July 20, 1964 should have tolled the period, although the record showed no such motion [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for relief from judgment was filed within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the denial of the petition. Under Section 3, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court, a petition for relief must be verified and filed within sixty (60) days after the petitioner learns of the judgment, and not more than six (6) months after the judgment is entered [9, 10]. In this case, plaintiffs learned of the judgment on June 20, 1964, but did not file the petition until October 23, 1964, a lapse of 125 days, which clearly exceeded the 60-day limit [5]. The Court rejected appellant's claim that a motion for reconsideration tolled the period, as there was no evidence in the record that such a motion was ever filed [8]. Furthermore, the Court noted that the summary judgment was the result of plaintiffs' failure to deny the request for admission under oath (Sec. 2, Rule 26) and failure to submit opposing affidavits (Sec. 3, Rule 34), rather than the alleged extrinsic fraud [11].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [12].
