I. CAPTION
JESUSA LACSON VDA. DE ARROYO, ET AL. v. EL BEATERIO DEL SANTISSIMO ROSARIO DE MOLO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22005, May 3, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In 1924, Ignacio Arroyo partitioned his estate *inter vivos* among his three children. In 1928, he donated the properties adjudicated to him (his free disposal portion) to respondent Beaterio del Santissimo Rosario de Molo. Ignacio died in 1935. In 1958, petitioners (heirs of Ignacio’s son, Jose Arroyo) filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo seeking to declare the 1928 donation inofficious and to recover the excess [1], [2], [3].

The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that the petitioners failed to establish a fair and reasonable basis to declare the donation inofficious. The petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), arguing that their evidence was sufficient. The CA affirmed the CFI's decision, finding no fair and reasonable basis in the evidence to support the claim of inofficiousness [4], [5]. Petitioners then filed a petition for review on certiorari with the Supreme Court, contending that the CA erred in its conclusion drawn from the facts [6], [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court can review the Court of Appeals' finding that the evidence was insufficient to declare the donation inofficious.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. The Court held that it can review decisions of the Court of Appeals only on errors of law, and the CA's findings of fact are conclusive [8], [6].

For a question to be one of law, it must involve no examination of the probative value of the evidence presented. If the query invites calibration of the whole evidence, credibility of witnesses, or the existence and relevancy of surrounding circumstances, it is a question of fact [8], [9]. Here, the petitioners sought a reversal based on the sufficiency of their evidence to prove the donation was inofficious. This necessarily requires the Supreme Court to weigh and evaluate the probative value of the evidence, which is a question of fact [10], [11]. The Court cited *Lim v. Calaguas* and *Rapatan v. Chicano* to reiterate that issues involving the evaluation of evidence are factual and within the exclusive province of the Court of Appeals [9], [12]. Consequently, the petition was denied and the decision appealed from was affirmed [13].
