I. CAPTION
HON. MARTINIANO P. VIVO, as Commissioner of Immigration v. HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL, as Judge of the CFI of Manila, et al., G.R. No. L-25442, June 29, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
This case is an offshoot of *Vivo v. Cloribel* (G.R. No. L-22354), decided on March 31, 1965, wherein the Supreme Court declared that private respondents, Chinese citizens who arrived as temporary visitors, had no right to stay in the Philippines and that the Commissioner of Immigration had the authority to order their departure [1, 2]. Despite the finality of said decision, respondents failed to leave and instead requested the Commissioner to allow them to stay under the President's "socio-economic program" [3]. When the Commissioner denied this request, respondents filed a petition for mandamus with preliminary injunction (Civil Case No. 63135) before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [4]. On October 29, 1965, respondent Judge Cloribel issued an order directing the Commissioner to desist from executing the acts complained of (i.e., deportation) [5].

Commissioner Vivo filed the present petition for certiorari to annul Judge Cloribel's order [5]. The Supreme Court issued a preliminary injunction restraining the Judge from assuming jurisdiction over Civil Case No. 63135 [5]. Subsequently, private respondents filed a manifestation seeking dismissal of the present case, attaching a "Motion to Withdraw Petition" filed in the lower court, admitting that their cause of action had no support given the finality of the Supreme Court's decision in G.R. No. L-22354 [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for certiorari has become moot and academic due to the withdrawal of the case in the lower court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the case had become moot and academic. The private respondents voluntarily filed a motion to withdraw Civil Case No. 63135 in the court below, acknowledging that their petition was left without support for its cause of action [7, 8]. Although the respondent Judge could not formally dismiss the case below because of the Supreme Court's restraining order, the discontinuance of the civil case would not prejudice the Government [9].

Consequently, the petition for certiorari was **dismissed** without costs. However, the Court expressly pronounced that its decision in the earlier case, G.R. No. L-22354 (declaring the aliens without right to stay), must be "immediately and fully implemented" [8].
