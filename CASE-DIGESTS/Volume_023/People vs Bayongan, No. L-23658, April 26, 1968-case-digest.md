I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. COSME BAYONGAN and MAGELLAN TOBIAS, G.R. No. L-23658, April 26, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On January 26, 1960, Roberto Bustamante was fatally shot after a dance in Sallapadan, Abra. The prosecution's sole eyewitness, Candido Ayco, testified that appellant Magellan Tobias challenged him with a gun, while appellant Cosme Bayongan arrived with a shotgun which he then handed to Tobias. Ayco claimed that when Bustamante approached, Tobias shot the victim. However, in a previous affidavit, Ayco had stated that *both* Tobias and Bayongan fired. Ayco also testified that at the time of the shooting, Tobias was behind the victim, while Bayongan was at the "left side towards the front" of the victim. The medical officer found that the deceased sustained a single gunshot wound with the point of entry at the back and exit at the front. The Court of First Instance of Abra convicted both Bayongan and Tobias of Murder and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the guilt of appellant Cosme Bayongan was proven beyond reasonable doubt.
2. W/N the guilt of appellant Magellan Tobias was proven beyond reasonable doubt.
3. W/N the crime committed was Murder.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court acquitted Bayongan. The physical evidence indisputably showed the bullet entered the victim's back and exited the front. Since Bayongan was positioned at the left side *towards the front* of the deceased, it was impossible for him to have fired the fatal shot. Furthermore, the conviction could not rest on the sole testimony of Ayco regarding Bayongan, as Ayco was self-contradictory (vacillating between claiming both fired in his affidavit and only Tobias fired in court). Citing *People v. Cauilan*, the Court held that while a single witness's testimony may suffice for conviction, it cannot be relied upon when it is inconsistent with the witness's previous statements and the physical facts.

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the guilt of Tobias, but modified the conviction. Ayco was firm in his testimony that Tobias shot the deceased, and this was corroborated by the physical evidence: Tobias was standing *behind* the victim, matching the wound's point of entry at the back. The defense's attempt to implicate a third party (Sagao) was uncorroborated and weak.

3. **NO.** The Court ruled that the crime committed by Tobias was simple Homicide, not Murder. The prosecution failed to establish the qualifying circumstances necessary for Murder. Consequently, the decision was modified: Bayongan was acquitted, and Tobias was found guilty of Homicide and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of six years and one day to fourteen years, eight months and one day.
