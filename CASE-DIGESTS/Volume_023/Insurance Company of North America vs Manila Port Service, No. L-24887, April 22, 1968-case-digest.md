I. CAPTION
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-24887, April 22, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On August 21, 1962, the vessel "SS Hoeisan Maru" took on board a shipment of goods in Copenhagen consigned to Ed. A. Keller & Co. Ltd. in Manila, insured by the Insurance Company of North America (Petitioner). The vessel arrived in Manila on September 25, 1962, and discharged its cargo into the custody of the Manila Port Service (MPS), a subsidiary of the Manila Railroad Company (Respondents). Upon delivery to the consignee, the shipment was short by 15 packages. Petitioner, as subrogee, filed a provisional claim on September 25, 1962, one day before the complete discharge of the shipment, as they were already aware of the bad order of some goods. Petitioner subsequently filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila in the alternative against the carrier (for admiralty) and the arrastre operator (MPS). MPS moved to dismiss, arguing that the claim against them was based on a contract of deposit and the amount demanded fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the City Court. The CFI denied the motion and rendered judgment for the Petitioner. MPS appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over an arrastre claim properly cognizable by the City Court when joined with an admiralty claim.
2. W/N the provisional claim filed before the complete discharge of the shipment was speculative and premature.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that since the alternative cause of action against the shipping firm was an action in admiralty, it was cognizable by the Court of First Instance. Under Section 5, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court, the joinder of causes of action and parties in the alternative is permitted. Therefore, the suit was correctly filed in the CFI, notwithstanding that the cause of action against the arrastre operator—if standing alone—would fall within the jurisdiction of the municipal court due to the amount of the demand. The Court relied on the ruling in *Rizal Surety & Insurance Co. vs. Manila Railroad* [1].

2. **NO.** The provisional claim was not premature. While the general rule in *Shell Company vs. Compañia General de Tabacos* states that claims filed before discharge are speculative, the Court applied the exception established in *New Hampshire Fire Insurance Co. vs. Manila Port Service*. A provisional claim is validly presented if the consignee has discovered or is informed of a shortage or damage before the discharge of the last package. In this case, the Petitioner was already aware of the bad order condition of the goods when the claim was filed on September 25, 1962, making the claim factual rather than speculative [2, 3].

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
