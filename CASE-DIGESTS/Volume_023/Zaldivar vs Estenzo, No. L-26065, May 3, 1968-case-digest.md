I. CAPTION
GERONIMO B. ZALDIVAR v. HON. NUMERIANO ESTENZO and SOTERO PEPITO, G.R. No. L-26065, May 3, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Geronimo Zaldivar, then incumbent municipal mayor of Albuera, Leyte, was the respondent in a special civil action for prohibition filed by respondent Sotero Pepito (a municipal councilor) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Ormoc City, presided by respondent Judge Numeriano Estenzo [1, 2]. Pepito alleged that Zaldivar appointed "special policemen and agents" solely to terrorize voters and frustrate the will of the people in the November 9, 1965 elections [2, 3].

On November 5, 1965, the same day the petition was filed, Judge Estenzo assumed jurisdiction and issued an *ex-parte* order for a preliminary injunction [4]. On April 28, 1966, the Judge rendered a decision against Zaldivar and ordered his arrest [5]. Zaldivar filed the present petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction, challenging the competence of the CFI to pass upon the matter [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to entertain a special civil action regarding the enforcement of election laws, specifically the appointment of special policemen by a mayor for alleged election terrorism.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the assumption of jurisdiction by the respondent Judge is "at war with the plain constitutional command." Under Article X, Section 2 of the 1935 Constitution, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) has "exclusive charge of the enforcement and administration of all laws relative to the conduct of elections" [7, 8].

The Court emphasized that the COMELEC is vested with direct and immediate supervision over municipal officials performing duties relative to the conduct of elections, including the power to recommend their removal for non-feasance, malfeasance, or misfeasance [8]. The grievance regarding the appointment of special policemen to terrorize voters is inextricably linked to the conduct of elections, making it an essentially political controversy [3, 9].

The judiciary should not be a co-participant in the enforcement of election laws, as it is hostile to a democratic system to involve the judiciary in the politics of the people [10]. If every CFI were to arrogate the power to disregard or contradict the COMELEC, the constitutional body would be reduced to impotence [11]. Furthermore, Judge Estenzo's hasty issuance of the injunction aroused suspicion regarding his impartiality, violating the requirement of "cold neutrality" expected of a judge [12, 13].

**Disposition:** The writ for certiorari is GRANTED. The decision rendered by respondent Judge, the order of arrest, and the writ of preliminary injunction issued by him are SET ASIDE. The preliminary injunction issued by the Supreme Court is made PERMANENT [14].
