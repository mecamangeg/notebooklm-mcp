I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MARIANO FONTANILLA**, G.R. No. L-25354, June 28, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
In September 1960, Fe Castro, a 15-year-old virgin, was brought to the house of Mariano Fontanilla (appellant) and his wife in San Juan, La Union, to serve as a helper. Fontanilla, then 52 years old, took advantage of his authority and the confidence reposed in him to have sexual intercourse with Fe repeatedly from September to December 1960 [1], [2]. A criminal complaint for qualified seduction was filed on February 28, 1961, in the Justice of the Peace Court (JPC) of San Fernando, La Union (the provincial capital) [3].

The JPC convicted Fontanilla, sentencing him to an indeterminate prison term and ordering him to pay P500.00 in moral damages to Fe "or" her parents [4]. Fontanilla appealed to the Court of Appeals, challenging the JPC's jurisdiction on two grounds: (1) the crime was committed in San Juan, outside the territorial jurisdiction of the San Fernando court; and (2) the civil liability involved (recognition of offspring/indemnity) removed the case from JPC jurisdiction [5], [6]. The CA certified the case to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Justice of the Peace Court of the provincial capital had jurisdiction over a crime committed in another municipality within the province.
2. W/N the civil liability inherent in qualified seduction divests the municipal court of jurisdiction.
3. W/N the guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt.
4. W/N the award of moral damages was correct.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Jurisdiction is determined by the statute in force at the time of the commencement of the action [7]. When the case was filed on February 28, 1961, Section 87(c) of the Judiciary Act (R.A. 296, as amended by R.A. 2613) granted JPCs in provincial capitals concurrent jurisdiction with Courts of First Instance over offenses committed "within the province" where the penalty does not exceed *prision correccional* or a fine of P3,000 [7]. Although R.A. 3828 later limited this jurisdiction to offenses committed "within their respective jurisdictions," this amendment took effect only on June 22, 1963, after the action had already commenced [8], [9].

2. **NO.** The court's jurisdiction is determined exclusively by the duration of imprisonment and/or the amount of the fine imposable by law, irrespective of civil incidents or obligations such as indemnity or recognition of offspring [10]. Civil liability is merely an incident of the crime, and the JPC of the provincial capital has jurisdictional parity with the CFI to impose such civil liabilities in cases falling within its concurrent jurisdiction [10], [11].

3. **YES.** Findings of fact by the trial court regarding the credibility of witnesses are commanded great weight [12]. The Court found Fe Castro's testimony credible despite minor inconsistencies due to her age and lack of education [13]. In qualified seduction, when the offender is entrusted with the keeping of the offended woman, abuse of confidence replaces deceit; thus, deceit need not be proved [14]. Fontanilla's defense of impotency due to old age (52 years old) was rejected as he failed to present medical evidence to rebut the presumption of virility [15], [16].

4. **NO.** The ruling was modified. First, the amount was increased to P2,500 due to the loss of virginity and resultant social prejudice [17]. Second, under Article 2219 of the Civil Code, moral damages in cases of seduction are recoverable by the victim *and* her parents, not alternatively ("or") as ordered by the lower court [17].

**Judgment affirmed with modification.** The appellant is ordered to pay P2,500 in moral damages to the offended party *and* her parents [18].
