**I. CAPTION**
PUA YI KUN v. THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES and HON. PLACIDO C. RAMOS, G.R. No. L-26256, June 26, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 13, 1964, petitioner Pua Yi Kun was charged with theft in the City Court of Manila (Crim. Case No. E-18590) for allegedly stealing stock certificates belonging to "Lepanto Consolidated Mining Co." and "Consolidated Mines, Inc." without their consent [1, 2]. He was arraigned and pleaded not guilty [3]. However, on January 29, 1965, the City Court dismissed the case upon the Fiscal's motion due to insufficiency of evidence [3].

On April 20, 1966, a new information for theft of the same stock certificates was filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila (Crim. Case No. 82120) against petitioner, this time alleging that the stocks belonged to "Chiong & Co., Inc." [4]. Petitioner moved to quash the information on the ground of double jeopardy [5]. The CFI denied the motion, ruling that the first information was defective for naming the wrong owners; thus, petitioner could not have been validly convicted under it, and no jeopardy attached [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the dismissal of the first information bars the second prosecution on the ground of double jeopardy.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court ruled that one of the requisites for a successful plea of double jeopardy is the existence of a valid complaint or information in the first prosecution sufficient to support a conviction [6].

Under Article 308 of the Revised Penal Code, the essential elements of theft include the taking of personal property "without the consent of the owner" [7, 8]. The first information alleged the taking was without the consent of the mining companies, who were not the true owners [9]. It failed to allege that the taking was without the consent of the actual owner, Chiong & Co. [9]. This deficiency was fatal because the non-consent of the true owner is essential to the existence of the crime [10]. Since the first information failed to allege a vital element of the offense, it was insufficient to support a conviction, and the petitioner was never placed in first jeopardy [11].

The Petition for Certiorari is dismissed [12].
