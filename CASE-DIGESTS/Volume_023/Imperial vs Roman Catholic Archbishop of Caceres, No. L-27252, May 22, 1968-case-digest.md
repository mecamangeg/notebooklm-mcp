I. CAPTION
FELIPE IMPERIAL v. THE ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP OF CACERES, JUDGE PERFECTO R. PALACIO, et al., G.R. No. L-27252, May 22, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Imperial was the lessee of a lot in Naga City owned by respondent Roman Catholic Archbishop of Caceres. In Civil Case No. 5292, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Sur rendered judgment rescinding the lease contract and ordering Imperial to vacate the premises and pay monthly rentals [1, 2]. Imperial appealed the decision. Before the record on appeal was approved, the CFI issued an order on May 6, 1966, granting execution pending appeal unless Imperial posted a P40,000 supersedeas bond [2]. On February 22, 1967, Imperial filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court, challenging the execution order and alleging he had appealed to the Supreme Court [2]. However, it was later established that Imperial had actually perfected his appeal to the Court of Appeals on December 10, 1966, prior to filing the instant petition [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court should entertain the petition challenging the order of execution pending appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court dismissed the petition [4]. The Supreme Court held that questions regarding the order for the execution of judgment are incidental to the appeal [5, 6]. Since the appeal had been perfected and was pending before the Court of Appeals, the petition should have been addressed to that court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction [3]. Orderly procedure dictates that writs incidental to the judgment be issued by the Court of Appeals where the case is pending review [3, 5]. Furthermore, the trial court did not lack jurisdiction in issuing the order, as it was done before the appeal was perfected and before the trial court lost control of the case [3].
