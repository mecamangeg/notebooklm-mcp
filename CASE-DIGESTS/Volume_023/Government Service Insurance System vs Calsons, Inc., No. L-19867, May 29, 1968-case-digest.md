I. CAPTION
**GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM v. CALSONS, INC., CESARIO P. CALANOC, and NENITA GODINEZ**, G.R. No. L-19867, May 29, 1968, 133 Phil. (Note: specific Phil Report citation not in text, using date/GR), Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Appellants Calsons, Inc., Cesario P. Calanoc, and Nenita Godinez obtained a P2,000,000.00 loan from the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) to pay the balance of the purchase price of five parcels of land and to finance the construction of a textile market building [1]. They executed a promissory note and a first mortgage on the parcels of land, stipulating that the mortgage covered the land "together with all the buildings and improvements now existing or which may hereafter be constructed" thereon [1].

GSIS later filed a complaint for foreclosure of the mortgage, alleging multiple violations of the contract [2]. Specifically, GSIS claimed that Calsons, Inc. removed and disposed of a complete band sawmill and filing machine which formed part of the mortgaged properties without GSIS's consent [2]. GSIS also alleged default in the payment of amortizations [2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila rendered judgment in favor of GSIS [3]. Calsons appealed, arguing, among other things, that the machineries were not included in the mortgage and that they were not in default [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the machineries (sawmill and filing machine) removed by the appellants are considered immovable property and thus included in the real estate mortgage.
2. W/N the appellants incurred default in their amortizations warranting foreclosure.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The machineries are considered part of the immovable property. The mortgage contract expressly covered the lands "together with all the buildings and improvements now existing" thereon [5]. The Court found that the machineries were permanently attached to the property and installed therein by the owner to meet the needs of certain works or industry [5]. Therefore, pursuant to **Article 415 of the Civil Code**, said machineries are considered part of the immovable property and need not be the subject of a separate chattel mortgage to be deemed duly encumbered in favor of the mortgagee [5, 6].

2. **YES.** The appellants failed to pay the amortizations as agreed. The promissory note provided that the first installment would become due the month following the expiration of the construction period, which was set at 12 months from the first release [7]. The construction period expired on November 7, 1958, making the first installment due in December 1958 [7]. The failure to pay the amortizations, interest, and surcharges constituted a violation of the mortgage contract, justifying foreclosure [7, 8].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [8].
