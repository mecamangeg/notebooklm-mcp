I. CAPTION
ANTONIO ROXAS, EDUARDO ROXAS and ROXAS Y CIA. v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS and COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-25043, April 26, 1968, 23 SCRA 276, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Antonio, Eduardo, and Jose Roxas inherited properties, including agricultural lands in Nasugbu, Batangas, and a residential house in Manila. They formed the partnership "Roxas y Cia." to manage these assets [1], [2]. To comply with the Government's policy of allocating lands to the landless, Roxas y Cia. agreed to sell 13,500 hectares of farmland to the Government for distribution to tenant-occupants. However, because the Government lacked funds, a special arrangement was made where Roxas y Cia. sold the lands directly to the farmers on installment [3]. The partnership reported 50% of the net gain from these sales as capital gains [4].

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed deficiency income taxes, treating Roxas y Cia. as a real estate dealer engaged in the business of selling real estate, thus making 100% of the profits taxable [5]. The CIR also assessed a real estate dealer's fixed tax because the partnership received P8,000.00 in annual rental from partner Jose Roxas for the residential house [6]. Furthermore, the CIR disallowed deductions for representation expenses (banquet tickets, beer) and contributions to various entities (police Christmas funds, Manila Police Trust Fund, Philippines Herald's fund, and a chapel at Far Eastern University) [7], [8]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) substantially affirmed the CIR's assessment [7], [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the gain from the sale of the farm lands is ordinary gain taxable at 100% (i.e., W/N Roxas y Cia. became a real estate dealer by subdividing and selling the lands).
2. W/N the disallowed deductions for representation expenses and contributions were proper.
3. W/N Roxas y Cia. is liable for the real estate dealer's fixed tax for renting the residential house to a partner.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that Roxas y Cia. cannot be considered a real estate dealer for this transaction. The sale was an isolated transaction with peculiar circumstances, done in obedience to the Government's policy to allocate lands to the landless [10], [11]. The partnership merely shouldered the Government's burden when it sold the lands directly to farmers due to the Government's lack of funds [11]. Consequently, the lands sold are capital assets, and the gain is taxable only to the extent of 50% under Section 34 of the Tax Code [12].

2. **PARTLY YES and PARTLY NO.** The Court ruled on the deductions as follows:
   - **Representation Expenses (Banquet tickets/Beer): NO.** There was no proof that these expenses were necessary and incurred in connection with the business [8].
   - **Police/Firemen Christmas Funds: NO.** These were gifts to families of members, not used exclusively for public purposes [13].
   - **Manila Police Trust Fund: YES.** This is a contribution to a government entity used exclusively for public functions [13].
   - **Philippines Herald's Fund: YES.** The fund was organized by a group of citizens solely for charitable purposes (Manila's neediest families), qualifying under Section 30(h) of the Tax Code [14].
   - **FEU Chapel: NO.** Far Eastern University gives dividends to stockholders; thus, its net income inures to private benefit, disqualifying the contribution [15].

3. **YES.** Under Section 194 of the Tax Code, a "real estate dealer" includes any owner of real estate receiving rentals of at least P3,000.00 a year [16]. The law makes no distinction as to who pays the rental, even if it is a partner in the partnership [16].

**Disposition:** The decision appealed from is MODIFIED. Roxas y Cia. is ordered to pay P150.00 as real estate dealer’s fixed tax, and the individual petitioners are ordered to pay reduced deficiency income taxes [17].
