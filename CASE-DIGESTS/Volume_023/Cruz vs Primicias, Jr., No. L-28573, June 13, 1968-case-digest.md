I. CAPTION
RUFINO A. CRUZ, ET AL. v. HON. CIPRIANO B. PRIMICIAS, JR., ET AL., G.R. No. L-28573, June 13, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Upon assuming office in 1967, respondents Provincial Governor Primicias, Jr. and the Provincial Board of Pangasinan approved Resolution No. 5 and Executive Order No. 2 on January 1 and 2, 1968. These directives authorized a reorganization of the provincial government for the stated purpose of "economy and efficiency." Consequently, the positions of petitioners, who were permanent civil service eligibles (Provincial Clerks), were abolished, and their services were terminated.

Simultaneously, the Executive Order created new positions for a "private and confidential staff," a Provincial Attorney's staff, and a Personnel Division. Petitioners filed a petition for Mandamus before the Supreme Court to annul the resolution and order. Respondents argued that the petition should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies with the Commissioner of Civil Service and maintained that the reorganization was a valid exercise of power to address the province's financial deficit.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition is barred by the failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
2. W/N the abolition of the petitioners' positions was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply because the issue at hand is the legal validity of the abolition of offices, not merely the removal or separation of employees. Determining whether an abolition is void is a legal issue for the Courts to decide. A valid abolition is neither a removal nor a separation (*Manalang v. Quitoriano*).

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the abolition was void because it was done in **bad faith**. While the abolition of an office is generally allowed, it is null and void if done for political reasons or to circumvent the constitutional security of tenure of civil service employees (*Briones v. Osmeña*; *Ocampo v. Duque*).
   
   The Court found the claim of "economy" to be a subterfuge because, while 22 occupied positions costing P25,538.71 per semester were abolished, respondents simultaneously created 28 new confidential positions and other offices costing P57,180.00 per semester. Furthermore, the claim of "efficiency" was rejected because petitioners, who were civil service eligibles, were replaced by "confidential" appointees chosen for their political loyalty. Political loyalty is not a statutory or constitutional ground for the separation of eligibles.

   **Disposition:** Petition GRANTED. Respondents are commanded to reinstate petitioners (except Myrna Sison), pay withheld salaries, and pay P3,000.00 in attorney's fees.
