I. CAPTION
ANTONIO LEE, et al. v. LEE HIAN TIU and THE LOCAL CIVIL REGISTRAR OF PASAY CITY, G.R. No. L-24540, April 25, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Antonio, Manuel Victorio, and Iluminada Lee, represented by their mother Laureana Tirona, filed a petition for the correction of their birth certificates with the Local Civil Registrar of Pasay City [1, 2]. They sought to change their nationality from "Chinese" to "Filipino," their status from "legitimate" to "illegitimate," and their mother's civil status from "married" to "single" [2]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal (Pasay City Branch), presided by Judge Mojica, dismissed the petition, applying the doctrine in *Ty Kong Tin v. Republic* [2]. Petitioners appealed, admitting that the corrections involved substantial changes to their citizenship and status, but hoped to overturn the existing jurisprudence [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for correction of entries in the civil registry may be used to effect substantial changes in nationality and civil status.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal, holding that substantial changes affecting citizenship and status cannot be granted through a summary petition for correction of entries [4, 5].

The Court reiterated the doctrine laid down in *Ty Kong Tin v. Republic* (94 Phil. 321), stating that reliance on such petitions for the purpose of changing one’s nationality is "frowned upon and discouraged" [5, 6]. Citing *Chug Siu v. Civil Registrar of Manila* and *Reyes v. Republic*, the Court emphasized that while the action ostensibly seeks a mere correction of an entry, it effectively requests a judicial declaration of Philippine citizenship, for which declaratory relief is not available in this jurisdiction [7].

The decision of the lower court was affirmed [8].
