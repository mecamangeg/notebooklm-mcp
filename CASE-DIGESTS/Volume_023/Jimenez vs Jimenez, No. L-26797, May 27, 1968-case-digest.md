**I. CAPTION**
REYNALDO JIMENEZ, ET AL. v. ARTURO T. JIMENEZ, G.R. No. L-26797, May 27, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Arturo Jimenez won the Christmas Sweepstakes and deposited P30,000.00 in Equitable Banking Corporation in the names of his minor children (respondents), handing the passbooks to his wife. Later, when the wife attempted to update the passbooks, she discovered Arturo had withdrawn the funds. The children, represented by their mother, filed a suit for recovery, alleging the deposits were a gift. Arturo answered that the funds were merely for safekeeping and not a donation. At the pre-trial, the parties agreed the sole issue was whether Arturo was justified in withdrawing the deposits. On the scheduled trial date, respondents' counsel failed to appear. Instead of conducting a trial or dismissing the case, the trial court ordered the parties to submit memoranda and subsequently rendered a decision condemning Arturo to restore the deposits and pay damages, relying on findings of fact without receiving any evidence. Arturo appealed, arguing the judgment was invalid as it was rendered without trial on controverted facts.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the trial court erred in rendering a judgment involving findings of fact without receiving evidence.
2. W/N the suit can prosper despite the lack of proof regarding efforts towards a compromise between family members.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court erred in making findings of fact without evidence or stipulation, given that the material allegations (ownership of deposits, existence of donation vs. trust, and damages) were controverted in the pleadings. The pre-trial agreement merely defined the legal issue but did not stipulate the facts necessary to resolve it. Citing *Asuncion v. Benalisa*, the Court emphasized that where facts are disputed, they must be determined on the basis of evidence. The submission of memoranda did not make the case ripe for decision as questions of fact remained.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that a remand is necessary under **Article 222 of the Civil Code**, which forbids the filing or maintenance of a suit between members of the same family unless it appears that efforts toward a compromise have been made and failed. In this case involving children against their father, such efforts were not properly proved, which is a condition precedent for the suit.

**Judgment set aside and case ordered remanded to court of origin for further proceedings.**
