I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC CEMENT CORPORATION v. THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-20660, June 13, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Republic Cement Corporation mined limestone, silica, and other minerals for the manufacture of cement. From 1957 to 1959, it paid royalties and *ad valorem* taxes based on the "cost of production" or extraction of the raw materials [1, 2]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed a deficiency of P498,653.04, arguing that the tax should be based on the gross receipts from the sale of the finished product (cement) [2, 3]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) upheld the CIR's assessment [3]. Petitioner appealed, contending the tax should be based on the value of the raw materials upon extraction, not the finished product [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the *ad valorem* tax should be based on the market value of the finished cement product.
2. W/N the tax assessment should be based on the cost of extraction of the raw materials.
3. W/N the petitioner is liable for the 25% surcharge despite claims of good faith.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The *ad valorem* tax is a severance tax imposed on the privilege of extracting minerals from the earth, not on the manufactured product [4]. Citing *CEPOC v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*, the Court held that while cement is composed of 80% minerals, it undergoes a definite chemical process and is no longer the "mineral product" contemplated by law [5]. Therefore, the tax must be based on the actual market value of the quarried minerals in their original state before processing into cement [6]. Consequently, the cost of paper bag containers for the cement is also excluded from the computation [7].

2. **NO.** Section 243 of the Tax Code expressly provides that the tax shall be assessed on the "actual market value" of the output, not the cost of production [8, 9]. "Actual market value" refers to the price the minerals would command in the ordinary course of business when offered for sale by one willing to sell to one willing to buy [9].

3. **YES.** Section 245 of the Tax Code mandatorily imposes a 25% surcharge for late payment [10, 11]. The Court ruled that bad faith is not essential for the imposition of this surcharge, distinguishing it from the 50% surcharge for false or fraudulent returns [12]. Petitioner cannot claim good faith regarding the use of "cost of extraction" versus "market value" as the law is clear, and its own lease contracts used the correct terminology [13].

The records were **REMANDED** to the Court of Tax Appeals for the determination of the actual market value of the minerals and further proceedings [14].
