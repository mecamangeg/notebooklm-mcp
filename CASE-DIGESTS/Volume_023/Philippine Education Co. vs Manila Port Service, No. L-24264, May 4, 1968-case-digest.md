I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE EDUCATION CO. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE AND MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-24264, May 4, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Philippine Education Co. (plaintiff) imported books and magazines, of which Manila Port Service (defendant arrastre operator) failed to deliver 12 cartons [1]. The parties entered into a Stipulation of Facts, acknowledging that the shipment's value was not specified in the manifest or bill of lading and that arrastre charges were paid based on weight/measurement [1]. Crucially, they stipulated that while the CIF value of the missing 12 cartons was P548.06, their total **invoice value** was only **P383.90** [2].

Under Section 15 of the Management Contract, the defendants' liability is limited to the "invoice value of each package but which in no case shall be more than five hundred pesos (P500.00) for each package" unless the value is otherwise specified [2]. Despite the stipulation regarding the invoice value, the Court of First Instance of Manila ordered the defendants to pay P500.00 [1]. Defendants appealed, arguing their liability should be limited to the stipulated invoice value of P383.90 [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendants' liability is limited to the invoice value of P383.90 rather than the maximum limit of P500.00.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court could not alter the terms of the Stipulation of Facts, which expressly stated the invoice value of the missing goods was P383.90 [4, 5].

The Management Contract clearly limits liability to the "invoice value," subject to a P500.00 ceiling per package [2, 4]. Since the parties stipulated the precise invoice value was P383.90 (which is below the ceiling), the defendants cannot be held liable for a greater sum [5]. The P500.00 amount serves as a maximum limit, not a fixed liability when the actual invoice value is lower.

Accordingly, the judgment is **MODIFIED**, ordering the defendants to pay the plaintiff the sum of P383.90, with legal interest [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, and Angeles concurred [6].
