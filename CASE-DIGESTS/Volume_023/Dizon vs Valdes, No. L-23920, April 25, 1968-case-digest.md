I. CAPTION
RAMON R. DIZON v. LORENZO J. VALDES, VALLESON, INC., and AUGUSTO J. VALDES, G.R. No. L-23920, April 25, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Ramon R. Dizon filed a suit for a sum of money against defendants Valleson, Inc. and Augusto J. Valdes. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of Dizon. While Valleson, Inc.'s appeal was pending, Dizon obtained a writ of preliminary attachment against the defendants' properties [1, 2]. The defendants moved to dissolve the attachment by filing a counter-bond subscribed by Capital Insurance & Surety Co., Inc., which the trial court granted [3].

Subsequently, Dizon filed a "Claim for Damages" against the counter-bond, alleging that the dissolution of the attachment put the properties out of his reach. The surety opposed, arguing that under the Rules of Court, its liability only attaches if execution is returned unsatisfied [4]. The trial court denied Dizon's motion, ruling it was premature since the case was still pending appeal [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiff can recover damages from the counter-bond while the main case is pending appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the plaintiff's claim is premature. Under Section 17 of Rule 59 of the Old Rules (now Rule 57), the surety on a counter-bond becomes liable only "[i]f the execution be returned unsatisfied in whole or in part" [5]. This provision contemplates proceedings on execution after a final judgment. Since the case was still pending appeal, no unsatisfied liability under the judgment existed yet to trigger the surety's obligation [5].

The Court further explained that the filing of a counter-bond does not prejudice the attaching creditor because the bond stands "in place of the properties so released" [6]. Additionally, the Court rejected Dizon's reliance on Section 20 (regarding claims for damages on a bond), clarifying that this section applies to damages sought by a defendant against whom an attachment was issued, not a remedy for the plaintiff [7].

The Order of the lower court is affirmed [8].
