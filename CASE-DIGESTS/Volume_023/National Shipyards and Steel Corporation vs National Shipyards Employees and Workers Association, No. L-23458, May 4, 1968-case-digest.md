I. CAPTION
NATIONAL SHIPYARDS AND STEEL CORPORATION v. NATIONAL SHIPYARDS EMPLOYEES & WORKERS ASSOCIATION and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-23458, May 4, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On November 5, 1956, respondent National Shipyards Employees' and Workers' Association staged a strike against petitioner National Shipyards and Steel Corporation (NASSCO). The dispute was certified to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [1]. The parties reached a settlement providing for the reinstatement of union president Melanio S. Capellan. However, NASSCO refused to reinstate him because he was convicted of slight physical injuries and sentenced to 20 days imprisonment, a judgment that became final in June 1959 [2].

On May 30, 1959, the CIR denied the union's motion for contempt, finding NASSCO's refusal justified due to the conviction. On July 6, 1959, the CIR ordered backwages paid only up to May 30, 1959 [2, 3]. Subsequently, on March 1, 1963, the President of the Philippines granted Capellan an "absolute and unconditional pardon," restoring him to "full civil and political rights" [3]. Consequently, the CIR issued an order on May 23, 1964, directing Capellan's reinstatement with backwages from the date of the pardon. NASSCO appealed, arguing that the pardon could not restore the office forfeited by reason of conviction [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the absolute pardon granted to the employee entitled him to reinstatement to his former position.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the CIR's order. Capellan was convicted of slight physical injuries with a penalty of 20 days imprisonment (*arresto mayor*) [6]. Under Article 44 of the Revised Penal Code, this penalty carries the accessory penalty of "suspension of the right to hold office and the right of suffrage **during the term of the sentence**" [7].

The Court held that this case involved only a suspended right to hold office, not a forfeited one [8]. Since the accessory penalty was limited to the 20-day term of the sentence, the suspension was lifted automatically upon service of the sentence, even without executive clemency [9, 10]. Furthermore, the absolute presidential pardon "blotted out of existence his guilt" and expressly provided for the restoration of political rights, including the right to hold office [9]. The Court distinguished this from cases involving forfeiture of office, ruling that the pardon erased all doubts regarding his reinstatement [10, 11].

**Order and resolution affirmed.**
