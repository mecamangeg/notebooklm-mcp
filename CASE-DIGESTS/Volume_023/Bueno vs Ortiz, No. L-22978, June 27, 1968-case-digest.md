**I. CAPTION**
**VALERIANO C. BUENO v. HON. JUDGE MONTANO ORTIZ, MACARIO C. CONDE and PEDRO B. PATANAO** (consolidated with *Director of Forestry v. Ortiz* and *Director of Forestry v. Patanao*), G.R. Nos. L-22978, L-24345 & L-24770, June 27, 1968, 23 SCRA 1151, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Pedro B. Patanao held timber licenses which expired in 1955 and 1957. His application for renewal was not approved due to unpaid forest charges. Despite a final 1962 Court of Appeals decision declaring he had no valid license, Patanao continued logging. He filed Civil Case No. 48 against petitioner Valeriano Bueno (a rival license holder) for damages, resulting in Judge Ortiz issuing a writ of attachment against Bueno's property and an order prohibiting Forestry officials and the Philippine Constabulary (PC) from entering the disputed area. Later, the Director of Forestry ordered Patanao to stop illegal operations. Patanao then filed Civil Case No. 190 against the Director and the PC to enjoin this order. In Case No. 190, Judge Ruiz declared the PC in default for late answer, despite the Director having answered, and issued a "permanent preliminary injunction" against the PC. The Director of Forestry and Bueno filed these consolidated petitions for certiorari and prohibition.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the writ of attachment against Bueno in Case No. 48 was valid.
2. W/N the lower court had jurisdiction to issue an injunction against the Bureau of Forestry and PC in Case No. 48.
3. W/N the default order and partial judgment against the PC in Case No. 190 were valid despite the Director of Forestry having filed an answer.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court found that Patanao lacked a cause of action against Bueno because he possessed no valid timber license, a fact already settled by the final judgment in CA-G.R. No. 27271-R. Consequently, the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the writ of attachment and garnishment.

2. **NO.** The writ of preliminary injunction in Case No. 48 addressed to the Bureau of Forestry and the PC was void. These government agencies were not parties to Case No. 48; thus, the lower court had no jurisdiction over them [1].

3. **NO.** The PC was acting merely as the agent of the Director of Forestry in enforcing forestry laws. Patanao's complaint stated a common cause of action against the Director and the PC. Under **Section 4, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court**, when a complaint states a common cause of action against several defendants, the answer filed by one inures to the benefit of the others who failed to answer. Therefore, the answer filed by the Director of Forestry inured to the benefit of the PC, rendering the default order and the subsequent *ex-parte* partial judgment improper [2].

Petitions **GRANTED**. The writ of attachment in Case No. 48, the injunction in Case No. 48, and the partial decision in Case No. 190 are annulled.
