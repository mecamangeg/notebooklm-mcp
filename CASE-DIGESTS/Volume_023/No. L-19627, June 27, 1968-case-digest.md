I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. ARMANDO L. ABAD, doing business under the trade name of Republic Alcohol Distillery, and the COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-19627, June 27, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Armando L. Abad, doing business as Republic Alcohol Distillery, applied for the denaturation of 33,000 gauge liters of rectified alcohol. On August 21, 1958, a BIR Denaturing Committee supervised the process and certified the alcohol as duly denatured [1-3]. However, during a surprise inspection on August 25, 1958, a BIR team discovered that the alcohol had not been completely denatured and could still be used for compounding liquors. By then, 22,580 gauge liters had already been removed and sold [4].

On September 2, 1958, Petitioner CIR demanded payment of P19,204.20 as specific tax on the removed alcohol and P10,000 as a compromise penalty [5]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled in favor of Abad, holding that he could not be liable for the removal as the denaturation was undertaken by the BIR committee without his intervention, and he should not be penalized for their negligence [6]. The CIR appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the manufacturer is liable for the specific tax on alcohol removed from the warehouse which was certified by a BIR Denaturing Committee but later found to be not completely denatured.
2. W/N the CIR can impose a compromise penalty on the taxpayer.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The manufacturer is responsible for the quality of his products and cannot escape liability by showing that the BIR Denaturing Committee certified his products [7]. The Supreme Court held that Abad’s permit expressly stated the manufacture of denatured alcohol was under his "exclusive responsibility" [7]. To rule otherwise would encourage irresponsibility and collusion to defraud the treasury. It is a settled rule that the State cannot be estopped by the neglect or omission of its agents, especially in taxation [7]. Citing *Central Azucarera de Tarlac v. Collector*, the Court reiterated that the government is not estopped by the mistakes of its officers [8, 9]. Furthermore, liability for the specific tax attaches immediately before removal from the place of production (Sec. 124, National Internal Revenue Code), regardless of whether the alcohol is actually used for industrial purposes or consumption [10].

2. **NO.** A compromise implies agreement, and one party cannot impose it upon the other [11]. Since Abad rejected the offer of compromise, the CIR cannot demand payment of the penalty. If the CIR believes the taxpayer is criminally liable, the proper recourse is to file a criminal action, as a penalty can only be imposed upon a finding of criminal liability [11].

ACCORDINGLY, the judgment appealed from is reversed, and the respondent is ordered to pay the petitioner the amount of P19,204.20 as specific tax, with interest. [12].
