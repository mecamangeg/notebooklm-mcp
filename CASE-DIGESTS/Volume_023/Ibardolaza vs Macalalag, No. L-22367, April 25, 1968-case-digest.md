**I. CAPTION**
AMADOR IBARDOLAZA v. THE HON. FELIX V. MACALALAG, PILAR C. TUMBOKON, JOSE M. CONCEPCION, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22367, April 25, 1968, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
On September 26, 1962, private respondents Pilar C. Tumbokon, et al. filed an application for registration of title to land (Lot No. 2) in the Court of First Instance of Aklan. On July 30, 1963, the respondent Judge Felix V. Macalalag issued an order of general default and referred the case to a commissioner for the reception of evidence. Petitioner Amador Ibardolaza subsequently filed a verified motion to set aside the order of general default, alleging that he owned approximately 110,000 square meters of the land applied for, which he had possessed continuously for over 25 years. He claimed "accident or mistake" for his failure to appear, stating he did not receive notice of the initial hearing from the clerk of court and did not see the published notice. The respondent Judge denied the motion and the subsequent motion for reconsideration. Ibardolaza filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, challenging the refusal to lift the default order.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to lift the order of general default.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the refusal to lift the order of general default constituted grave abuse of discretion. The Court held that in ascertaining such abuse, the "environmental facts" must be assessed. The refusal was abusive because: (1) the petitioner’s affidavit of merit stated he was not sent notice of the initial hearing; (2) his claim of ownership appeared meritorious on its face, being based on continuous possession for over 25 years, payment of taxes, and introduction of improvements (fishpond); and (3) records indicated the disputed land bordering the "Sibuyan Sea" might be an accretion or foreshore land belonging to the public domain.

The Court emphasized that the right to be heard is deeply ingrained in the judicial system and should not be denied absent substantial prejudice to the adverse party and in the face of a good defense. The Land Registration Act does not make an order of general default an inflexible judicial act that shuts off a meritorious claim. Consequently, the petition was granted, and the Court directed that copies of the decision be forwarded to the Director of Lands and the Solicitor General to ascertain if the land is public land [citing *Ignacio vs. Director of Lands* and *Joven vs. Director of Lands*].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Castro, Angeles, and Fernando, JJ., concurred).
