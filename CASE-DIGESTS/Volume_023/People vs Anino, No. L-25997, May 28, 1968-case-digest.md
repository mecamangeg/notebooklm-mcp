I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MONICA ANINO, G.R. No. L-25997, May 28, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Monica Anino, the Barrio Captain of Villaflor, Oroquieta, Misamis Occidental, was charged with dereliction of official duty under Article 208 of the Revised Penal Code. The information alleged that in 1965, she tolerated illegal cockfights and a game of chance called "hantak," collecting 20% of the proceeds for the barrio treasury [1]. The Provincial Fiscal filed the case directly with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Misamis Occidental [2, 3]. Anino filed a motion to quash, arguing that: (1) under Section 12 of the Barrio Charter (R.A. 3590), the Municipal Mayor has exclusive jurisdiction to investigate complaints against barrio officials; and (2) under R.A. 3828, the CFI lacked jurisdiction because the penalty for the offense (imprisonment of 6 months and 1 day to 2 years and 4 months) fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Municipal Court [3-5]. The CFI denied the motion, and Anino appealed [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Provincial Fiscal has the authority to file a criminal case against a barrio official directly with the court, independent of the Municipal Mayor's administrative investigation.
2. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the Municipal Mayor's power to investigate under Section 12 of R.A. 3590 is purely administrative in nature, limited to imposing penalties of reprimand, suspension, or dismissal [6]. When official misconduct constitutes a violation of penal laws, it becomes the duty of the prosecuting officer to institute criminal proceedings [6]. Administrative removal is entirely distinct from criminal action; the fact that a statute makes conduct a ground for removal does not relieve the official of criminal responsibility (*Ingco v. Provincial Fiscal of Batangas*) [7]. To hold otherwise would tie the hands of the prosecuting arm of the State [8].

2. **YES.** While R.A. 3828 expanded the jurisdiction of Municipal Courts to include offenses punishable by imprisonment of not more than 3 years, it did not divest the CFI of its jurisdiction over offenses punishable by imprisonment of more than 6 months [9]. Therefore, where the prescribed penalty is imprisonment for more than 6 months but not exceeding 3 years, the Municipal Court and the CFI have **concurrent jurisdiction** (*Esperat v. Avila*) [10].

Appeal dismissed and case remanded to court of origin for further proceedings [11].
