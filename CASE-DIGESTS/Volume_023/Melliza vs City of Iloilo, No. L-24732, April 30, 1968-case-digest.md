I. CAPTION
PIO SIAN MELLIZA v. CITY OF ILOILO, UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-24732, April 30, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On November 15, 1932, Juliana Melliza executed a public instrument selling portions of Lot 1214 to the Municipality of Iloilo (now City of Iloilo) for the construction of a City Hall, avenues, and parks according to the "Arellano Plan." The deed specifically identified Lots 1214-C and 1214-D but also stated that the sale included such lots and portions necessary for the government center per the Arellano Plan. Subsequently, Juliana sold her remaining interest in Lot 1214 to Remedios Sian Villanueva, who then transferred her rights to petitioner Pio Sian Melliza. Petitioner obtained a title over Lot 1214-B.

In 1949, the City donated the City Hall site, encompassing Lots 1214-B, C, and D, to the University of the Philippines (UP). When UP enclosed the site in 1952, Petitioner demanded payment for Lot 1214-B, arguing it was not included in the 1932 sale and that the general reference to the Arellano Plan failed to meet the legal requirement for a determinate object. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, ruling that Lot 1214-B was included in the sale. The Court of Appeals affirmed this decision.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 1932 contract of sale included Lot 1214-B.
2. W/N the object of the sale was determinate or capable of being determinate as required by law.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the intention of the parties was to provide the Municipality with sufficient land for the City Hall site. Lot 1214-B, being contiguous to the specifically mentioned lots and situated in the heart of the City Hall site, was clearly intended to be included in the conveyance based on the description regarding the "Arellano Plan."

2. **YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the requirement for a determinate object was met. Under Article 1273 of the old Civil Code (Article 1460 of the new Civil Code), an object is determinate if, at the time the contract is entered into, it is capable of being made determinate without the necessity of a new or further agreement between the parties. The "Arellano Plan" was in existence at the time of the 1932 sale. By referencing this plan, the specific lots needed for the City Hall site could be ascertained. Therefore, the object was determinable at the time of the contract's execution without need for further agreement. Additionally, the Court noted that the Petitioner, who acted as the notary public for the 1932 deed, was barred by laches for failing to object to the municipality's possession of the lot for over 20 years.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
