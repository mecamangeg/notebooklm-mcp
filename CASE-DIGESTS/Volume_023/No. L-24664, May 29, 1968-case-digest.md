I. CAPTION
CORAZON ALEGRE, ET AL. v. VICTORIA G. DE LAPERAL, G.R. No. L-24664, May 29, 1968, 23 SCRA 934, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants were tenants occupying separate apartments owned by defendant-appellee Victoria G. de Laperal in Manila for about three years. On October 27, 1964, De Laperal notified the tenants that effective January 1, 1965, their monthly rentals would be increased, and if they were not agreeable to the new rates, they should vacate the premises. The tenants refused to pay the increase or vacate. On January 5, 1965, they judicially consigned the old rental amounts and filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to fix the duration of the lease and for damages.

De Laperal answered that the lease was on a month-to-month basis and filed a counterclaim for the recovery of possession (unlawful detainer). The CFI dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint, ordering them to vacate the premises and pay back rentals. The plaintiffs appealed. Pending the appeal, the CFI issued a writ of execution because the plaintiffs failed to deposit the monthly rentals as required by the judgment.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the plaintiffs are entitled to a fixed longer term for the lease under Article 1687 of the Civil Code.
2. W/N the trial court had authority to issue a writ of execution pending appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that even if a lease contract is not for a fixed period, the law does not grant the lessee a positive right to demand a longer term. Article 1687 of the Civil Code only vests the court with discretionary authority to "fix a longer term," which it may exercise or not. Furthermore, relying on the doctrine in *Prieto v. Santos*, the Court ruled that an extension of the lease term may be sought by the tenant *before*, not *after*, the termination of the lease. In this case, the lease expired on December 31, 1964, pursuant to the defendant's notice. The plaintiffs filed their action on January 5, 1965, after the lease had already terminated.

2. **YES.** The trial court had authority to order execution. Under Rule 39, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, the court may issue a writ of execution if the motion is filed *before* the approval of the record on appeal, which was the case here. Even if the record on appeal had been approved, such approval is merely provisional regarding pending motions for execution. Additionally, the Court found that the defendant's counterclaim was in the nature of an unlawful detainer action. Since the plaintiffs failed to deposit the rentals fixed in the judgment, the lower court correctly ordered execution pursuant to Section 10 in relation to Section 8 of Rule 70 of the Rules of Court.

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
