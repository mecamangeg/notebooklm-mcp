I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, CHAN DE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-25551, May 29, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Chan De, a Chinese national, arrived in the Philippines in 1934. He filed a petition for naturalization on February 11, 1960, which the Court of First Instance of Manila granted on October 15, 1960. The Republic appealed, questioning Chan De's qualifications on three grounds: (1) His character witnesses, Bonifacio Quinto and Ricardo Acuña, only knew him since 1944 and 1949, respectively, despite his arrival in 1934; (2) In his wife's death certificate, he listed his name as "Mr. Chua Tu Lai," an alias he did not disclose in his petition or include in the publication; and (3) He enrolled his children in schools with predominantly Chinese student populations (Hope Christian High School, Philippine Chinese Republican School, and Chiang Kai Shek High School).

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the gap in the witnesses' knowledge of the petitioner's conduct is fatal to the petition.
2. W/N the failure to publish the petitioner's alias is fatal to the proceedings.
3. W/N the enrollment of children in predominantly Chinese schools disqualifies the petitioner.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The law requires an applicant to maintain irreproachable conduct during his *entire* stay in the country. Since Chan De arrived in 1934 but his earliest witness could only testify from 1944, there is a gap of at least 10 years regarding his behavior. This void in evidence is fatal to his application [1].

2. **YES.** The petitioner used the name "Chua Tu Lai" in a public document (his wife's death certificate) but failed to include it in his petition and publication. This failure is fatal because it precluded persons who knew him by that name from coming forward with derogatory information [2, 3]. Furthermore, his attempt to conceal or justify this fact was deemed an act of dishonesty and misbehavior [3, 4].

3. **YES.** The enrollment of the petitioner’s children in schools where the student population is predominantly Chinese (72% to 84%) negates a sincere desire to embrace the customs, traditions, and ideals of the Filipino people. This circumstance alone is sufficient to disqualify him from becoming a Filipino citizen [5, 6].

The appealed order is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DISMISSED** [7].
