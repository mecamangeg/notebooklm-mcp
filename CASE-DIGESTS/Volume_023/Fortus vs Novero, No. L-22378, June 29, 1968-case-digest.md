I. CAPTION
CLEMENTE FORTUS, ET AL. v. ROSARIO NOVERO and JULIA T. FORTUS, G.R. No. L-22378, June 29, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Subject of the case is the estate of Ciriaca Angelo, which passed to her grandson Victorino Fortus. Victorino died intestate and without issue, survived by his widow, respondent Julia T. Fortus. Petitioners (Clemente Fortus, et al.) claimed to be Victorino's legitimate half-brothers and sisters—children of Victorino's father, Fermin Fortus, with Jacoba Aguil—and sought to inherit. The Court of First Instance dismissed petitioners' claim and declared Julia the sole heir, ruling that Fermin and Jacoba were never legally married, thus rendering petitioners illegitimate and barred from inheriting from their legitimate half-brother under Article 992 of the New Civil Code. Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), presenting baptismal certificates and oral testimony to prove the marriage, claiming records were lost during the war. The CA affirmed the trial court, finding as a fact that no marriage existed due to the absence of civil records and contradictory evidence. Petitioners filed a petition for review on certiorari with the Supreme Court, challenging the CA's appreciation of the evidence.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court may review the factual finding of the Court of Appeals regarding the non-existence of the marriage between Fermin Fortus and Jacoba Aguil.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. The Court held that in an appeal by certiorari, its jurisdiction is limited to deciding questions of law [1]. The determination of whether the parties were legally married involves the calibration of evidence, credibility of witnesses, and the existence of surrounding circumstances, which is a question of fact [2]. Findings of fact by the Court of Appeals are conclusive and binding on the Supreme Court unless the inference drawn is "manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible" [3].

In this case, the CA's finding was supported by evidence, including a certification from the Archives Division that no marriage record existed [4]. The Court also affirmed that baptismal certificates (Exhibits 2 and 4) are conclusive proof only of the administration of the sacrament, not of the veracity of the statements regarding the parentage or relationship of the persons baptized [5, 6]. Since the CA's conclusion was not arbitrary and was based on a thorough review of the evidence, the Supreme Court declined to disturb it. The decision was affirmed [7].
