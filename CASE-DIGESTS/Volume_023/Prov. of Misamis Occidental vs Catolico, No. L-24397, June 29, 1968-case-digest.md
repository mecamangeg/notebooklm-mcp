I. CAPTION
THE PROVINCE OF MISAMIS OCCIDENTAL v. HON. ALFREDO CATOLICO and ATTY. RUFINO J. ABADIES, G.R. No. L-24397, June 29, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Province of Misamis Occidental prevailed in a suit against NAWASA for the recovery of a waterworks system. Respondent Judge Catolico awarded P5,000.00 as attorney's fees [1]. Respondent Atty. Abadies, a legal assistant in the Governor's office who substituted the Provincial Fiscal as counsel on the condition that he would not be paid fees, filed a motion for payment [1, 2]. The Judge granted the P5,000.00 fee, which the Petitioner appealed on July 4, 1964 [2]. Abadies then moved to increase the fees to P25,000.00 on *quantum meruit* [2]. On September 12, 1964, the Judge increased the award to P50,000.00 [2]. Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration on October 2, 1964, which was denied on October 24, 1964 [3]. Petitioner filed a new notice of appeal on November 7, 1964, but the Judge disallowed the record on appeal [3]. The Judge and Abadies argued the appeal was not perfected because the Motion for Reconsideration was merely *pro forma*, rendering the September 12 order final, and that the petition for mandamus was filed late (over 4 months) [4-6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration was *pro forma*, thereby preventing the perfection of the appeal.
2. W/N the petition for mandamus is barred by laches for being filed four months after the denial of the appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the Motion for Reconsideration was not *pro forma*. While the motion could have been improved in logic or rhetoric, it cannot be condemned as an exercise in futility [7]. As a government entity, the Petitioner should not be penalized for its counsel's failure to put the case in the strongest possible light [7]. Since the Petitioner had already manifested dissatisfaction with the P5,000.00 award, it is reasonable to assume they were even more aggrieved by the increase to P50,000.00 [7]. The appeal was duly perfected and the right to appeal must be accorded full recognition [7, 8].

2. **NO.** Citing *Centenera v. Yatco*, the Court ruled that Section 15, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court does not specify a period for filing mandamus proceedings against an order disapproving an appeal [6, 9]. This implies the period is variable as the ends of justice may demand [9]. The constant policy of the courts is not to deny the writ if it would deprive a party of a substantial right and leave them without a remedy [9].

Petition for mandamus is **GRANTED**. The Respondent Judge is compelled to allow the appeal [10].
