I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. PERFECTO R. PALACIO, MACARIO M. OFILADA, and ILDEFONSO ORTIZ, G.R. No. L-20322, May 29, 1968, 23 SCRA 899, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Ildefonso Ortiz filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Sur against the Handong Irrigation Association, Inc. and the Irrigation Service Unit (ISU) to recover possession of a lot and damages [1]. The ISU, a government agency under the Department of Public Works and Communications, failed to answer and was declared in default [1]. The Solicitor General moved to dismiss, arguing ISU had no juridical personality, but the CFI denied this, ruling that ISU was engaged in the private business of selling pumps and thus waived immunity [2].

A writ of execution was issued, and the Sheriff garnished ISU's pump irrigation trust fund deposited at the Philippine National Bank [3]. The Solicitor General moved to lift the garnishment on the ground that the funds were public and exempt from execution [4]. The CFI denied the motion. On certiorari, the Court of Appeals (CA) dismissed the Republic's petition, sustaining the garnishment because ISU allegedly engaged in private business [4]. The Republic filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the pump irrigation trust fund of the ISU may be garnished to satisfy a money judgment.
2. W/N the State is liable for the torts attributed to the ISU.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The ISU is a government office created to promote a specific economic policy (rehabilitation of irrigation systems) and does not operate for profit; thus, it is not engaged in private business [5]. Even assuming the State waived its immunity from suit, it does not follow that its property and funds are liable to seizure [6]. It is a well-settled rule that execution cannot issue on a judgment against the State, as the power of the courts ends when judgment is rendered [7]. The satisfaction of such judgments requires legislative provision [7]. Furthermore, garnishing the trust fund would constitute a disbursement without proper appropriation and divert funds from the purposes contemplated by the Philippines-United States Bilateral Agreement [8, 9].

2. **NO.** The liability of the ISU arose from tort (inducing the invasion of Ortiz's land), not contract [10]. Under Article 2180 of the Civil Code, the State is liable only for torts caused by its special agents specially commissioned to carry out the acts complained of outside their regular duties [10]. There was no proof that the ISU was authorized to commit the tortious inducement; hence, neither the State nor its funds can be held liable [10].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED** and set aside, and the order of garnishment is declared **NULL AND VOID**. [11]
