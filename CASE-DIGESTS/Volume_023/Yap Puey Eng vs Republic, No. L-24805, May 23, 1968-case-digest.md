I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. YAP PUEY ENG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-24805, May 23, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Yap Puey Eng filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental. In his petition, he averred that his present residence was Ozamis City and his former residence was Amoy, China [1]. However, during his testimony, he admitted that he resided in Cuba, Clarin, Misamis Occidental during the Japanese occupation (1941-1945) and studied in Cebu City from 1929 to 1931 [1]. Additionally, the evidence showed that his four children were enrolled in Chinese schools, specifically the Cebu Gospel School (Cebu Kian Kee High School) and the Misamis Chinese High School [2, 3]. The trial court granted his petition for Philippine citizenship [4]. The Republic appealed the decision [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to allege all former places of residence in the petition is fatal to the application for naturalization.
2. W/N the enrollment of the petitioner's children in Chinese schools constitutes a disqualification.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the failure to allege a former place of residence is fatal to a citizenship application [5]. Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law requires the petition to state the "present and former places of residence," which encompasses all places where the petitioner actually and physically resided [1]. This rule is mandatory because such information is necessary to provide the government and the public a fair opportunity to check the petitioner's activities and register objections [5]. Furthermore, such omission affects the jurisdiction of the court [5].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the enrollment of an applicant's children in Chinese schools raises the inference that he has not evinced a sincere desire to learn and embrace the customs, traditions, and ideals of the Filipinos [2, 6]. This failure constitutes a disqualification in a citizenship application under established jurisprudence [6].

Accordingly, the judgment is **REVERSED**, and the petition for naturalization is **DISMISSED** [7].
