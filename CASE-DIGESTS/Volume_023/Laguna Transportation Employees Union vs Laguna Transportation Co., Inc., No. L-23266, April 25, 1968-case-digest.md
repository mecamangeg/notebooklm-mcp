I. CAPTION
LAGUNA TRANSPORTATION EMPLOYEES UNION, ET AL. v. LAGUNA TRANSPORTATION CO., INC., No. L-23266, April 25, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, comprising the labor union and individual employees Vicente Marfil, Pedro Alinsod, and Glicerio Artes, filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) against respondent Laguna Transportation Co., Inc. They alleged they were dismissed for refusing to disaffiliate from the union. Respondent denied the charges, asserting just causes for the separations: Marfil, a bus inspector, was habitually late, drowsy due to gambling, and caught sleeping on duty [1]; Alinsod, a dispatcher, was frequently absent from his post [2]; and Artes, a former driver, was not rehired upon the company's incorporation because he was 63 years old and physically unfit [3]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) dismissed the complaint, ruling that the separations were for just cause and not due to union activities [4]. The CIR *en banc* affirmed the decision [4]. Petitioners appealed, arguing their evidence was "more than preponderant" [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal or non-employment of the petitioners constituted Unfair Labor Practice.
2. W/N the CIR's factual findings are supported by substantial evidence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's decision.

The Court held that in reviewing CIR decisions, it is guided by the **substantial evidence rule**, not the preponderance of evidence rule. Factual findings of the CIR are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence, even if the evidence is conflicting [5-7].

Applying this standard, the Court found substantial evidence supporting the existence of just causes for separation, negating the charge of ULP:
1.  **Marfil and Alinsod:** Their dismissals were valid due to absenteeism, inefficiency, laziness, and disobedience (e.g., sleeping on duty). The Court cited *Caltex (Philippines), Inc. v. Philippine Labor Organization* and *El Hogar Filipino*, ruling that such conduct justifies dismissal [8, 9].
2.  **Artes:** No employer-employee relationship existed as he was never rehired by the new corporation. His non-hiring was justified by his advanced age. Under **Article 1755 of the Civil Code**, common carriers are required to exercise extraordinary diligence and cannot be compelled to entrust the safety of passengers to a driver who is physically unfit due to old age [10]. Without an employer-employee relationship, the ULP suit must fail [11, 12].

The judgment of the CIR was affirmed [13].
