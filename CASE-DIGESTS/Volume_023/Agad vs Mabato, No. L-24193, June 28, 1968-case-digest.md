I. CAPTION
MAURICIO AGAD v. SEVERINO MABATO & MABATO & AGAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-24193, June 28, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On August 29, 1952, Mauricio Agad and Severino Mabato executed a public instrument forming a partnership to "operate a fishpond," with each partner contributing P1,000.00 to the capital [1, 2]. Mabato managed the partnership funds and rendered accounts from 1952 to 1956, but failed to do so for the years 1957 to 1963 despite demands [1]. Agad filed a complaint for his share of profits and the dissolution of the partnership [1]. Mabato moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the partnership contract was void *ab initio* under Article 1773 of the Civil Code because an inventory of the fishpond was not attached to the public instrument [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance of Davao dismissed the complaint, reasoning that a partnership engaged in the fishpond business necessarily involves the contribution of immovable property [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the partnership contract is void under Article 1773 of the Civil Code for failure to attach an inventory of the fishpond.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's dismissal. Article 1773 declares a partnership void only when "immovable property is contributed thereto" without a signed inventory attached to the public instrument [5]. In this case, the partners' contributions were explicitly limited to P1,000.00 each [2, 5]. The partnership was established to *operate* a fishpond, not to engage in the fishpond business by contributing the land itself [5]. Neither the fishpond nor any real right thereto was contributed to the partnership's capital [2]. Therefore, Article 1773 does not apply, and the contract is valid under Article 1771 [5, 6].

The Order appealed from is set aside and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [6].
