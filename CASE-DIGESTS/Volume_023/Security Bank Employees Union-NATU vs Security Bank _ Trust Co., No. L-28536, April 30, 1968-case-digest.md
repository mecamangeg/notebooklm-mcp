I. CAPTION
SECURITY BANK EMPLOYEES UNION-NATU and RUBEN PUERTOLLANO v. SECURITY BANK & TRUST COMPANY and HON. JOSE N. LEUTERIO, G.R. No. L-28536, April 30, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On October 20, 1967, petitioner Security Bank Employees Union-NATU filed a notice of strike with the Department of Labor alleging unfair labor practices (ULP) by respondent Security Bank & Trust Co., specifically regarding interference with self-organization and support for a rival union. The next day, the Bank filed a complaint for damages with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, presided by respondent Judge Leuterio. The Bank alleged that the strike notice violated the "no-strike" clause of their Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) and that no labor dispute existed, characterizing the conflict as a mere inter-union rivalry between NATU and another federation (LMM).

Judge Leuterio issued an *ex parte* restraining order prohibiting the union from staging a strike or picketing "of whatever kind or form." The Union opposed, arguing the CFI lacked jurisdiction as the case involved ULP, falling under the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). The Judge denied the opposition, maintaining there was no labor dispute. The Union filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over a case involving the enforcement of a collective bargaining agreement (no-strike clause) when unfair labor practices are alleged.
2. W/N the lower court can validly issue an injunction prohibiting picketing "of whatever kind or form."

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court of First Instance has no jurisdiction; exclusive jurisdiction lies with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). Jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint. While the Bank framed the suit as a breach of contract (CBA), the Supreme Court applied the doctrine in *Republic Savings Bank v. CIR*, holding that collective bargaining is a continuous process. Consequently, the duty to bargain imposes the obligation to comply with the CBA terms, and non-compliance (such as violating a no-strike clause) constitutes an unfair labor practice (refusal to bargain). Under the Industrial Peace Act, ULP cases fall within the exclusive competence of the CIR. Furthermore, the rivalry between unions constitutes a labor dispute, contrary to the lower court's finding.

2. **NO.** The injunction was invalid. The Industrial Peace Act (Section 9) prohibits courts from issuing restraining orders against peaceful picketing in cases involving labor disputes. The Supreme Court emphasized that picketing is a form of giving publicity to a labor dispute. Citing *Caltex Refinery Association v. Lucero* and *Mortera v. CIR*, the Court ruled that peaceful picketing is a constitutional right embraced in the freedom of expression. A blanket prohibition against picketing "of whatever kind or form," including peaceful modes, is contrary to law and the Constitution.

Petition is **GRANTED**.
