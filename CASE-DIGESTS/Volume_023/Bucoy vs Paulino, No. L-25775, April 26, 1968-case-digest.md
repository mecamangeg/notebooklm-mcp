**I. CAPTION**
TOMASITA BUCOY v. REYNALDO PAULINO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25775, April 26, 1968, 23 SCRA 248, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiff Tomasita Bucoy and defendant Reynaldo Paulino were married in 1956. During their marriage, they acquired seven parcels of land in Angeles, Pampanga, and constructed "Pauline’s Motel." Reynaldo had an extramarital affair with defendant Eufemia Bernardo. To secure loans from Eufemia and upon her insistence, Reynaldo registered the titles to the properties in his name as "single," although Eufemia knew he was married.

On July 5, 1963, Reynaldo executed a Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgages in favor of Eufemia, conveying the seven lots for P495,000.00. The deed acknowledged receipt of P195,000.00 in cash (which was never actually paid) and the assumption of P300,000.00 in bank mortgages. Eufemia subsequently registered the deed, obtained titles in her name, and married another man. Tomasita filed a complaint to annul the sale and cancel the titles, invoking Article 173 of the Civil Code due to lack of her consent. Reynaldo filed a cross-claim against Eufemia for annulment/rescission due to fraud and non-payment. The trial court dismissed Tomasita’s complaint on the ground of estoppel but granted Reynaldo’s cross-claim partially.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the properties are conjugal despite being registered in the husband's name as "single."
2. W/N the wife is estopped from questioning the sale.
3. W/N the contract of sale entered into by the husband without the wife's consent is void *in toto*.
4. W/N the husband is entitled to annul or rescind the contract.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** By Article 160 of the Civil Code, all property of the marriage is presumed to belong to the conjugal partnership unless proved exclusive. The registration of the properties in the name of the husband alone does not destroy their conjugal nature [1].

2. **NO.** Estoppel *in pais* requires, among other elements, that the party to whom the representation is made must have been ignorant of the truth. Eufemia was not misled; she knew Reynaldo was married and explicitly participated in the scheme to register the titles as "single" to secure her loans [2]-[3]. Tomasita did not conceal facts or mislead Eufemia [2].

3. **YES.** Article 173 of the New Civil Code allows the wife to annul any contract entered into by the husband without her consent. Unlike the Spanish Civil Code, which limited annulment to the extent of prejudice to the wife, the New Civil Code requires the wife's consent under Article 166. Consequently, a contract executed without such consent is subject to annulment in its entirety, not merely as to the wife's share [4]-[5]. The sale is null and void *in toto* [5].

4. **YES.** Reynaldo’s consent was vitiated by undue influence and fraud, entitling him to annulment under Article 1390(2) [6]. Furthermore, Eufemia failed to pay the agreed price. While Article 1191 allows the court to fix a period for payment, Article 1592 specifically governs the sale of immovable property and prohibits the granting of a new term after a judicial demand for rescission has been made [7]-[8].

**Disposition:** The judgment is MODIFIED. The deeds of sale are declared NULL and VOID. Eufemia Bernardo is ordered to return possession of the properties and their fruits (P8,000.00/month) to the spouses Paulino. The Register of Deeds is directed to cancel Eufemia's titles and issue new ones in the name of Reynaldo Paulino and Tomasita Bucoy.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None.
