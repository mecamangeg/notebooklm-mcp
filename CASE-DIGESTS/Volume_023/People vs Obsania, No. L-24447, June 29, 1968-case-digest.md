I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. WILLY OBSANIA, G.R. No. L-24447, June 29, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On November 22, 1964, a complaint for rape was filed in the Municipal Court of Balungao, Pangasinan against Willy Obsania for the rape of 14-year-old Erlinda Dollente. The complaint alleged carnal knowledge through violence and intimidation but did not explicitly aver "lewd designs." After the case was remanded to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan, the Fiscal filed an information incorporating the complaint's allegations and adding that the offense was committed with "lewd designs." Upon arraignment, Obsania pleaded not guilty. His counsel then moved to dismiss the case, arguing the original complaint was fatally defective for failing to allege "lewd designs," thereby depriving the court of jurisdiction. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the action. The prosecution appealed, and the accused contended that the appeal placed him in double jeopardy.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N "lewd designs" must be explicitly alleged in a complaint for rape.
2. W/N the appeal by the prosecution places the accused in double jeopardy given the dismissal was upon his own motion.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that in a complaint for rape, it is not necessary to allege "lewd design" or "unchaste motive." To require such averment is a patent superfluity. Lascivious intent inheres in rape, and unchaste design is manifest in the very act of carnal knowledge through force or intimidation [1]. The complaint was legally sufficient as it unmistakably alleged carnal knowledge by means of violence and intimidation [2].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the appeal did not constitute double jeopardy because the dismissal was with the express consent of the accused. The Court applied the doctrines of **waiver** (*People v. Salico*) and **estoppel** (*People v. Acierto*) [3], [4]. It held that the application of these doctrines requires two *sine qua non* conditions: first, the dismissal must be sought or induced by the defendant personally or through counsel; and second, such dismissal must not be on the merits and must not necessarily amount to an acquittal [5].

The Court distinguished this case from *People v. Cloribel*, where dismissals sought by defendants were considered acquittals because they were predicated on the right to a speedy trial and the government's failure to prosecute [6], [7]. Here, the dismissal was based on an erroneous jurisdictional objection raised by the accused, not on the merits or lack of evidence [8]. Having induced the trial court to dismiss the case on a false legal premise, the accused is estopped from pleading double jeopardy [9], [10].

**Disposition**: The order appealed from is set aside, and the case is remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings [5].
