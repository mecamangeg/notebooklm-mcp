I. CAPTION
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. HON. NICASIO YATCO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Quezon City, Branch V, SEBASTIAN L. ROSALES and CANUTO GERONIMO, G.R. No. L-23056, May 27, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Manila Railroad Company (MRRCo) and respondent Sebastian Rosales entered into a compromise agreement in Civil Case Q-7712, which was approved by respondent Judge Yatco on March 18, 1964. The agreement stipulated that MRRCo would deliver "structural steel junks" to Rosales. Alleging non-delivery, Rosales obtained execution orders on March 31 and May 29, 1964. However, these orders directed the Sheriff to take possession of "structural steel," omitting the specific descriptor "junks" found in the judgment. Based on these orders, the Sheriff and Rosales seized and attempted to seize *brand-new* structural steel from MRRCo’s compound. The orders also authorized the police to take into custody anyone obstructing the execution. MRRCo filed urgent motions objecting that the items being taken were brand-new and not the "junks" agreed upon, requesting a hearing to present evidence on the nature of the materials. Judge Yatco denied the motions and refused to receive evidence, reasoning that the judgment based on the compromise was final and executory. MRRCo filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion by refusing to hear evidence regarding the quality of the structural steel (whether junk or brand-new) sought to be delivered.
2. W/N the trial court’s order authorizing the immediate custody of persons obstructing the execution constitutes a violation of due process regarding indirect contempt.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The refusal to admit evidence constituted grave abuse of discretion. The Supreme Court held that while the judgment was final, the parties and the court were bound by the specific description of the property sold, which was "structural steel junks" [1]. The execution orders impermissibly broadened the Sheriff's authority by omitting the word "junks," leading to the seizure of brand-new steel not contemplated in the compromise [2], [3]. The Court ruled that evidence was imperative to determine if the execution conformed to the judgment, as allowing the taking of new steel for junk would violate the petitioner's rights [4], [5]. The trial court retains jurisdiction to control the conduct of its ministerial officers and amend processes to conform to law and justice (Sec. 5, Rule 135, Rules of Court) [6].

2. **YES.** The order authorizing the arrest of unspecified persons violated the rules on indirect contempt. Section 3, Rule 71 of the Rules of Court requires that for indirect contempt (disobedience of a lawful order), a written charge must be filed and the accused given an opportunity to be heard before punishment [7], [8]. The Court ruled that the "broad sweep" of the order directing the custody of "any and all" persons prior to any specific contemptuous act or charge was a denial of due process and a drastic measure lacking good reason [9], [10].

**Petition GRANTED.** The orders of March 31 and May 29, 1964, are declared NULL and VOID. The lower court is directed to hear evidence on the nature of the structural steel.
