I. CAPTION
AMADO L. MENDOZA v. RODRIGUEZ & COMPANY, doing business under the style and trade name of JOSEPH ENTERPRISES, G.R. No. L-24564, May 27, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On October 16, 1963, Joseph’s Enterprises and its partners (the Rodriguezes) filed Civil Case No. 6642 against Amado Mendoza to annul a service contract, alleging Mendoza forged their signatures or used fraud to secure an onerous percentage of their gross income [1]. Mendoza answered, asserting the contract was valid and approved by the partners, but he did not claim unpaid compensation in that suit [2].

On May 15, 1964, Mendoza filed the present suit, Civil Case No. 6705, against Rodriguez & Company (alleging Joseph's Enterprises was merely its trade name) to recover P34,360.59 in unpaid compensation based on the same contract involved in the first case [3, 4]. The lower court consolidated the cases. Rodriguez & Co. moved to dismiss Case No. 6705, arguing Mendoza’s claim should have been set up as a compulsory counterclaim in Case No. 6642 [5]. The Court of First Instance of Quezon dismissed Case No. 6705 [6]. Mendoza appealed, challenging Joseph's Enterprises' legal capacity to sue and the dismissal based on the counterclaim rule [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Mendoza is estopped from questioning the legal capacity and juridical personality of Joseph’s Enterprises.
2. W/N Mendoza’s claim for unpaid compensation is barred for failure to set it up as a compulsory counterclaim in Civil Case No. 6642.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that Mendoza is estopped from questioning the juridical personality of Joseph’s Enterprises. The contract Mendoza relies upon—and which he drafted himself—explicitly states it was executed by the managing partner of "JOSEPH'S ENTERPRISES, a Partnership duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines" [8]. By drafting, signing, and profiting from the agreement, Mendoza recognized the partnership's personality and cannot later deny it [9].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that Mendoza’s claim is barred. Under Rule 9, Section 4 of the Rules of Court (now Rule 9, Section 2), a counterclaim is compulsory if it arises out of or is necessarily connected with the transaction that is the subject matter of the opposing party’s claim [10]. Mendoza's claim for compensation relies on the very same contract that Joseph’s Enterprises sought to annul in Case No. 6642. Thus, it was necessarily connected to the first case. Because Mendoza failed to set it up in Case No. 6642, he is barred from enforcing it in a subsequent action [10].

The order appealed from is affirmed [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, and Angeles concurred. Justice Fernando took no part [11].
