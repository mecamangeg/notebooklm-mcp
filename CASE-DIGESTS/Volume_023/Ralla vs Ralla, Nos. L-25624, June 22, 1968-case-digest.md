I. CAPTION
PEDRO RALLA v. PABLO RALLA, CARMEN MUÑOZ and REGISTER OF DEEDS OF ALBAY, G.R. Nos. L-25624-31, June 22, 1968, 23 SCRA 1069, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pedro Ralla and respondent Pablo Ralla were heirs of the spouses Rosendo Ralla and Paz Escarella, whose estates were under settlement in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Albay [1]. The original owners' duplicate titles for 113 lots were presented in court [2]. Pablo claimed he bought the lots from his father Rosendo, but Pedro impugned the sale as fraudulent and simulated in the estate proceedings [3].

During the proceedings, Pablo requested to withdraw the owners' duplicate titles from the court for "safekeeping," promising to produce them when demanded [4]. However, without court authority, Pablo used these titles to register the disputed deed of sale and secured new Torrens titles in his and his wife's names [5, 6]. Pedro filed petitions in the cadastral court under Section 112 of the Land Registration Act (Act 496) to cancel the new titles and restore the originals [7, 8]. The CFI dismissed the petitions, ruling that the issues were "litigious" regarding ownership and thus outside the limited jurisdiction of a cadastral court [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the cadastral court has jurisdiction to order the cancellation of the new titles and the restoration of the original ones despite the dispute over ownership.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court reversed the order of dismissal [9]. While relief under Section 112 of Act 496 generally requires unanimity among parties or the absence of a "serious adverse claim"—and questions of ownership are typically considered serious—the Court ruled that "equitable considerations require that the *status quo ante* be restored" [10-12].

The Court held that Pablo violated the trust reposed in him when he obtained the titles solely for safekeeping and instead used them to register the disputed sale [5, 12]. Allowing the new titles to stand while the validity of the sale was still being litigated in the estate proceedings would give Pablo and his wife an unfair advantage, such as the presumption of legitimate ownership [11]. The Court emphasized that courts are not powerless to fashion a remedy to prevent one party from taking advantage of another during pending proceedings [11, 12].

Consequently, the Supreme Court ordered the lower court to verify if the titles were entrusted to Pablo for safekeeping; if confirmed, the Register of Deeds was directed to cancel the titles of Pablo and his wife and reinstate the original titles [13].
