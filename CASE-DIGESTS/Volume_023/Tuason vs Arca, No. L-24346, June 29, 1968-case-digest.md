I. CAPTION
JUAN E. TUASON v. HON. FRANCISCO ARCA and JUANA T. DE LA VIÑA, G.R. No. L-24346, June 29, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tuason filed an ejectment case against private respondent De la Viña in the Court of First Instance of Manila. In 1956, the trial court rendered a decision ordering De la Viña to vacate the leased lots, remove the buildings thereon, and pay rentals [1]. This judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1960 and became final [1]. Execution proceedings followed, and the Sheriff sold De la Viña's buildings to Tuason after the Court of Appeals dismissed De la Viña's various petitions to block the execution [2-4].

Despite the final judgment and the dismissal of De la Viña's petitions by the appellate courts, respondent Judge Arca issued orders in 1964 and 1965 refusing to order the demolition of the buildings [5]. Judge Arca denied Tuason's motion for demolition on the grounds that the houses had "sentimental value" and that depriving De la Viña of them would violate due process [5]. Instead, the Judge ordered that De la Viña be placed in possession of one of the houses of her choice [6]. Tuason filed a petition for certiorari to annul these orders.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to order demolition and restoring possession to the judgment debtor based on "sentimental value" and "due process."

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the respondent Judge’s refusal to enforce the final judgment constituted a plain abuse of discretion [6]. A final judgment affirmed by the Supreme Court must be executed, and the trial court is duty-bound to enforce it [6]. The Court ruled that denying the judgment creditor his remedy based on "due process" is a perversion of the constitutional provision, as the respondent had ample opportunity to be heard before the judgment of eviction became final [7]. Furthermore, "sentimental value" is not a valid justification for refusing execution; any prejudice can be compensated by damages [7]. Under Rule 39, Section 14, when a judgment debtor fails to remove improvements, the sheriff may be authorized to demolish them so the landowner can recover possession [7]. Additionally, De la Viña's claim that the buildings were not on the petitioner's land was barred by estoppel for not being raised in the main case [8].

The petition is GRANTED. The orders of the respondent Judge are annulled, and the respondent court is ordered to grant the demolition and enforce the writs of execution [8].
