I. CAPTION
PROGRESSIVE LABOR ASSOCIATION, BERNARDO O. CALANG, DOMINADOR RUIZ and DELFIN N. MERCADER v. HON. JUDGE GUILLERMO VILLASOR, CEBU CARTAGE CORPORATION, ATLAS CONSOLIDATED MINING & DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, COMMANDING OFFICER OF 3RD PC ZONE & PROVINCIAL COMMANDER, MAYOR MARCELO BARBA and CHIEF OF POLICE OF TOLEDO CITY, G.R. No. L-26383, April 3, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On March 31, 1966, petitioner Progressive Labor Association (Union) presented demands to respondent Atlas Consolidated Mining & Development Corporation (Atlas). Alleging unfair labor practices (ULP) by Atlas, the Union filed a complaint in the Court of Industrial Relations and later staged a strike and picketing on July 11, 1966 [1, 2]. Respondent Cebu Cartage Corporation, which held a hauling contract with Atlas, filed a complaint for injunction and damages in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu (Civil Case No. R-9460) to prevent strikers from blocking its trucks. On July 16, 1966, the CFI, presided by Judge Villasor, issued an *ex-parte* preliminary injunction against the Union [2]. The Union moved to dissolve the injunction and dismiss the case, arguing the existence of a labor dispute connected with ULP, but the CFI denied the motions [3]. The Union filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, which issued a preliminary injunction [3, 4]. However, on June 13, 1967, the Union filed a motion stating the strike had formally ended on October 4, 1966, and requested the termination of the Supreme Court's injunction [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition to annul the CFI's *ex-parte* preliminary injunction has become moot.
2. W/N the CFI has jurisdiction over the complaint for damages despite the allegation of a labor dispute connected with unfair labor practices.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The petition regarding the injunction is moot. The strike and picketing, which the *ex-parte* preliminary injunction sought to restrain, formally ceased on October 4, 1966, as admitted by the petitioners [5, 6]. Since the acts sought to be enjoined are no longer existent, the injunction has lost its purpose and effectivity. The Court held that there is "no necessity of further declaring it void and ineffective, since it is, of itself, already ineffective" [6-8].

2. **YES.** Regular courts have jurisdiction over complaints for damages [9-11]. The Court ruled that while the petition alleged the labor dispute was connected with unfair labor practices, such an allegation "without supporting proof, is insufficient to show that the Court of First Instance has no jurisdiction" [9-11]. The lack of a cause of action, if any, is not a jurisdictional defect [11].

Petition dismissed [12].
