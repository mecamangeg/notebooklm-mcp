I. CAPTION
CHUA UAN alias PETER CHUA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20952, May 22, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On January 30, 1960, the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental granted the application for naturalization of Chua Uan (alias Peter Chua) [1]. The Republic initially appealed but later withdrew, making the decision final. On February 6, 1962, Chua Uan petitioned to take his oath of allegiance [2]. The Government opposed the oath-taking, arguing that: (1) Chua Uan used the alias "Peter Chua" without judicial authority, appearing in his baptismal certificate and clearances, thus failing to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner; (2) he failed to prove he could write a principal Philippine dialect (Ilongo); and (3) he failed to prove he had not left the Philippines since the 1960 decision [2-4]. The lower court granted the petition for oath-taking on October 27, 1962, prompting this appeal by the Republic [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner’s use of the alias "Peter Chua" constituted improper conduct barring naturalization.
2. W/N the petitioner failed to prove he could write a principal Philippine dialect.
3. W/N the petitioner successfully proved continuous residence in the Philippines during the two-year probationary period.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court found that the use of the name "Peter Chua" was "more apparent than real" [3]. The alias was entered in his baptismal certificate through an honest mistake by the priest, without Chua Uan's knowledge or consent [3]. The petitioner never used the alias personally; rather, it appeared in documents signed or issued by third parties [5]. Including the alias in his naturalization petition was done solely to conform to the baptismal certificate and avoid concealing a material fact [5]. As he did not use the alias without judicial authority, there was no misconduct [3, 6].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the lower court's finding that petitioner "speaks and understands Ilongo dialect" reasonably implied he could also write it; otherwise, the court would have dismissed the original petition [7, 8]. Furthermore, the Solicitor General had previously withdrawn an appeal on this specific ground after verifying the petitioner's competence, settling the issue [8].

3. **YES.** The petitioner testified under oath that he never left the Philippines since the promulgation of the decision and dedicated himself to his profession as a cashier [9]. The Government failed to present any evidence to refute this testimony [9].

**Order affirmed.**
