I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE AIR LINES, INC. v. CIVIL AERONAUTICS BOARD and FILIPINAS ORIENT AIRWAYS, INC., G.R. No. L-24219, June 13, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Filipinas Orient Airways, Inc. (Fairways) filed an application with respondent Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to operate domestic air services. Petitioner Philippine Air Lines, Inc. (PAL) objected to the application. While the hearings were ongoing and before the presentation of evidence was completed, Fairways filed an "urgent petition for provisional authority to operate," claiming *prima facie* fitness and public need. CAB granted the provisional authority. PAL filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that CAB lacked the power to grant such authority prior to the final decision on the main application, that there was no evidence to support the grant, and that PAL was denied due process as the authority was issued before it could present its evidence, allegedly prejudging the case [1-5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N CAB has the authority to issue a temporary operating permit before the final decision on the main application.
2. W/N the issuance of the provisional authority violated PAL's right to due process.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 10-C(1) of Republic Act No. 776 explicitly authorizes the CAB to issue "any temporary operating permit" or Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. Nothing in the law negates the power to issue such a permit before the completion of evidence on the main petition. In fact, the CAB's authority to grant a temporary permit "upon its own initiative" suggests the power to exercise it even before evidence presentation begins [6]. Furthermore, the policy of public service law sanctions the issuance of provisional permits before a decision on the merits when public convenience and necessity require it (*Javellana v. La Paz Ice Plant & Cold Storage Co.*) [7].

2. **NO.** The petitioner's reliance on *Ang Tibay v. C.I.R.* is misplaced because that case refers to conditions essential for a valid *decision on the merits*. Here, the Court is concerned with an *interlocutory order* issued prior to the decision. Interlocutory orders may be issued *ex parte* in administrative proceedings without violating due process (*Cornejo v. Gabriel*). The constitutional requirement to clearly express facts and law applies to decisions on the merits, not interlocutory orders (*Soncuya v. National Loan & Investment Board*). Moreover, administrative findings are entitled to respect unless clearly insubstantial, and the provisional nature of the permit does not prejudge the merits of the main case [8, 9].

Petition dismissed and writ prayed for denied [9].
