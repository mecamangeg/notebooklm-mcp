I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. EULOGIO BALAO, G.R. No. L-22250, May 22, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Eulogio Balao, then a Senator, filed a civil action for damages and a criminal action for libel against Gregorio Co regarding an open letter the latter published [1]. During the trial of the civil case, Balao took the witness stand and uttered statements describing Co as a "known extortionist" and a "criminal" [1, 2]. Based on these utterances, Co filed an information for Grave Slander against Balao [3]. Balao moved to quash the information, claiming the statements were covered by the rule of absolute privilege [4]. Although initially denied, the trial court reconsidered and dismissed the case after Balao submitted evidence—including the civil complaint and transcripts of his testimony—attached to his rejoinder, which the court reviewed to find the statements privileged [4, 5]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that a motion to quash hypothetically admits the information's allegations and that the defense of privilege should be raised at trial, citing *Duque v. Santiago* [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court properly quashed the information for slander on the ground of privileged communication before trial.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the order of dismissal [8, 9]. While *Duque v. Santiago* held that the question of privilege is generally a matter of defense at trial, the Court distinguished the present case [7]. In *Duque*, the prosecution immediately challenged the propriety of submitting evidence regarding privilege during the motion to quash [7]. In contrast, the evidence supporting Balao's claim of privilege in this case was allowed to enter the record without objection from the prosecution [10]. Since the trial court was able to consider this unopposed evidence to determine that the statements were relevant to the judicial inquiry and thus privileged, it did not err in quashing the information [10].
