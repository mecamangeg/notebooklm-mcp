I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE TESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED MAXIMA SANTOS VDA. DE BLAS, PONCIANO B. FLORES v. ROSALINA SANTOS, ARSENIO S. PASCUAL and MARVIN S. BUENDIA**, G.R. No. L-24538, May 4, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On June 11, 1964, Executrix Rosalina Santos and the heirs of Maxima Santos Vda. de Blas filed a second partial project of partition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal [1]. The project adjudicated the hereditary rights of heir Marvin Buendia, including his share in a property under TCT No. 42372, to Arsenio S. Pascual, based on an alleged sale/assignment made by Buendia to Pascual in 1962 [1, 2]. The lower court approved the partition on June 15, 1964 [1].

Petitioner Ponciano Flores filed a petition to set aside the order, claiming he had acquired Buendia's share in a public auction on February 12, 1964, pursuant to a writ of execution issued by the CFI of Pampanga in a separate civil case against Buendia [1]. Flores argued he was not notified of the partition hearing and that the adjudication to Pascual was contrary to the Rules of Court [3]. The Executrix opposed, arguing Buendia had already assigned his rights to Pascual before Flores' attachment [2]. The CFI of Rizal denied Flores' petition [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the attachment and execution sale invoked by petitioner Flores was valid and binding against the estate in *custodia legis*.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's denial of Flores' petition because he failed to comply with the specific procedure for attaching property in *custodia legis*.

The Court held that under **Rule 57, Section 7(f) of the Rules of Court** (specifically the paragraph regarding property in *custodia legis*), a copy of the order of attachment must be filed with the proper court where the estate is being settled, and notice served upon the custodian of such property [6]. Petitioner Flores relied on a writ of execution from the CFI of Pampanga but failed to file the necessary notice with the CFI of Rizal (the probate court) or serve the administrator as required by the Rules [7].

Since the property formed part of an estate in *custodia legis* and the required legal procedure was not followed, Flores' attachment could not affect the probate court's valid adjudication of the shares to Pascual [7]. The order of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, and Angeles concurred. Chief Justice Concepcion took no part [8].
