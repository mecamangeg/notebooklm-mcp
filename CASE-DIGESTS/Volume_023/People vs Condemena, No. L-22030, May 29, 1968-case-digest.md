I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DARIO ROLDAN, G.R. No. L-22030, May 29, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On August 10, 1962, in Kalibo, Aklan, accused Dario Roldan attacked Manuel Apolonio, hitting him in the right eye and causing injuries that required medical attendance for 69 days [1-3]. Roldan was charged with Serious Physical Injuries under an Information specifically alleging evident premeditation [2]. Initially pleading "not guilty," Roldan later moved to change his plea [4]. The prosecution filed an Amended Information reducing the civil liability, to which Roldan pleaded "guilty" [4, 5]. The trial court convicted him, offsetting the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation with the mitigating circumstance of his plea of guilt [6]. Roldan appealed, arguing that evident premeditation should have been proven by evidence despite his plea and that he should have been credited with voluntary surrender [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a plea of guilty constitutes an admission of the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation alleged in the Information.
2. W/N the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender applies when the accused surrenders only after the warrant of arrest is served.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** When an accused pleads guilty, it is understood that they do so fully cognizant of the consequences and have carefully read the charges. A plea of guilty signifies the admission of all material facts alleged in the information, including the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation [7, 8]. The Court relied on the doctrine in *People v. Sabilul*, noting that Roldan had ample time to consider his plea with the aid of counsel [8].

2. **NO.** There is no voluntary surrender to speak of when the accused surrenders only after the warrant of arrest issued against him has been served [9, 10]. The records from the Justice of the Peace Court confirmed that Roldan was served the warrant prior to his surrender [6]. Consequently, the trial court correctly appreciated only the plea of guilt as a mitigating circumstance to offset evident premeditation [6].

The decision of the Court of First Instance is AFFIRMED [11].
