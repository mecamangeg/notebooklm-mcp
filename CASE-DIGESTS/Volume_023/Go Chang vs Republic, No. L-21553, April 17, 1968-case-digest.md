I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. JOHN GO CHANG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21553, April 17, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
John Go Chang filed a petition for naturalization as a Filipino citizen with the Court of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 50717). At the time the petition was filed, Chang had an annual income of P2,400, excluding bonuses. The trial court granted the petition for citizenship. The Republic of the Philippines appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner’s annual income of P2,400 is considered lucrative for naturalization purposes.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, ruling that an annual income of P2,400 at the time of filing is not considered lucrative. Citing *Po Chu Sam v. Republic* [G.R. No. L-20812], the Court reiterated that bonuses are excluded from the assessment of income. Relying on *Tan v. Republic* [G.R. No. L-22077], the Court held that the specific amount earned by the petitioner did not satisfy the statutory requirement for lucrative income.

Accordingly, the judgment of the lower court is reversed and the petition is denied.
