**I. CAPTION**
FILIPINAS INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION, RUBEN & CO., INC. and HONORIO ALLADO v. HON. LOURDES P. SAN DIEGO and PASTOR D. AGO, G.R. No. L-22347, May 27, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

**II. FACTS**
On May 3, 1963, respondent Pastor D. Ago filed a complaint for damages with preliminary attachment and injunction in the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Quezon City) against petitioners Filipinas Industrial Corporation, et al. [1]. Ago filed the suit in his own name, explicitly stating he was acting in his capacity as the attorney-in-fact of Francisco Laiz, the principal [1]. Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of improper venue and that the action was not brought in the name of the real party in interest [2, 3]. They argued that Laiz, the real party in interest, and the defendants were residents of Cotabato or Davao, not Quezon City where Ago resided [2]. Respondent Judge San Diego denied the motion, ruling that an authorized agent may sue in his own name and his residence establishes proper venue [4]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N an attorney-in-fact can bring an action in his own name for a disclosed principal.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** Section 2, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court mandates that "Every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest" [6]. The real party in interest is the one who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit [6]. An attorney-in-fact is not a real party in interest; a judgment for or against him personally or as *apoderado* does not bind or affect the principal [7, 8]. The Supreme Court held that even if a principal authorizes his agent to commence actions in court for and in his behalf, such action must still be filed in the name of the principal [9, 10]. Consequently, Ago had no right to bring the action in his own name, and the respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in denying the motion to dismiss [10]. The petition is **GRANTED** and the complaint in Civil Case No. Q-7228 is ordered **DISMISSED** [11].
