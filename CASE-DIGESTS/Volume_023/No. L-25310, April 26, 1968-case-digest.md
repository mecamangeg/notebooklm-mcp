**I. CAPTION**
**THE NATIONAL WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY (NWSA) v. QUEZON CITY and THE CITY MAYOR**, G.R. No. L-25310, April 26, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner NWSA owns various parcels of land in Balara, Quezon City. Over several years, NWSA paid real property taxes to respondent Quezon City. Notably, only the taxes for the years 1957 and 1961 were paid under protest [1]. Following the Supreme Court’s 1963 decision in *Board of Assessment Appeals of Laguna v. Court of Tax Appeals and NWSA*—which declared NWSA exempt from realty tax—NWSA demanded a refund of P984,494.54 representing taxes paid from 1951 to 1962 [2, 3]. Quezon City refused the refund.

NWSA filed an action for recovery in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. Quezon City argued that the taxes were paid without protest (except for 1957 and 1961), that the claims had prescribed, and that the exemption did not apply to leased properties [3]. The CFI ruled in favor of NWSA, ordering a refund of taxes paid within the six-year prescriptive period [4]. Quezon City appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N NWSA properties are exempt from real property tax.
2. W/N payment under protest is a prerequisite for the recovery of the taxes paid.
3. W/N the tax exemption extends to NWSA properties leased to private entities.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** NWSA properties are exempt from real property tax. Under Section 47(a) of Republic Act 537 (Revised Charter of Quezon City), properties owned by the Republic of the Philippines are exempt. Applying the principle of *stare decisis* from the *Board of Assessment Appeals of Laguna* case, NWSA’s properties are classified as properties of the Republic, regardless of whether they are public or patrimonial in nature [5, 6].

2. **YES.** Section 63 of Republic Act 537 expressly prohibits courts from entertaining any suit assailing the validity of a tax assessment unless the taxpayer has paid the tax under protest [6]. The Court rejected NWSA's claim that it paid in good faith (*solutio indebiti*) and thus need not protest. Since NWSA paid under protest in 1957 and 1961, it was aware of the tax issue and cannot claim innocent error for the subsequent years [7, 8]. Consequently, recovery is limited to payments made under protest. However, the claim for the 1957 tax is barred by the six-year prescriptive period [9].

3. **YES.** The lease of NWSA lots to private entities (e.g., Capitol Hills Golf Club) does not defeat the tax exemption. Citing the *Laguna* ruling, the Court held that the exemption subsists as long as the properties are owned by the Republic of the Philippines (NWSA), regardless of their use or lease to private parties [9].

**Judgment modified.** NWSA is allowed to recover only the realty taxes paid under protest for the year 1961, in the amount of P55,160.15 [10].
