I. CAPTION
LA SUERTE CIGAR & CIGARETTE FACTORY, plaintiff, vs. CENTRAL AZUCARERA DEL DANAO, ET AL., defendants; CENTRAL AZUCARERA DEL DANAO, third-party plaintiff-appellant, vs. TALISAY-SILAY MILLING CO., INC. and J. AMADO ARANETA, third-party defendants-appellees, G.R. No. L-23017, May 23, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
La Suerte Cigar & Cigarette Factory filed a complaint for a sum of money against Central Azucarera del Danao (Central), Talisay-Silay Milling Co., Inc., and J. Amado Araneta for cigarettes delivered between 1954 and 1955. The complaint was dismissed against Talisay-Silay and Araneta, leaving Central as the sole defendant. Central then filed a third-party complaint against Talisay-Silay and Araneta, seeking to shift liability based on a March 3, 1960 Agreement involving the Philippine National Bank (PNB).

Under Paragraph 9 of said Agreement, Central assumed liability for obligations incurred prior to the agreement if they were (a) outstanding in the books, (b) listed/itemized, and (c) approved by PNB. Under Paragraph 10, Talisay-Silay and Araneta assumed liability for obligations "not appearing in the books" nor acknowledged as per Paragraph 9.

In its third-party complaint, Central alleged that the claim was never approved or acknowledged by PNB, implying Talisay-Silay and Araneta should be liable. However, Central did not allege whether the obligation appeared in its books. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental dismissed the third-party complaint for failure to state a cause of action.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the third-party complaint states a cause of action against the third-party defendants.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The third-party complaint failed to state a cause of action. The test of legal sufficiency of facts alleged in a complaint is whether or not, admitting the facts alleged, the court could render a valid judgment in accordance with the prayer [1].

Here, the liability of the third-party defendants (Talisay-Silay and Araneta) was defined by the Agreement. Specifically, Paragraph 10 stipulated that they would be liable for obligations *not appearing in the books* of Central [2]. Central's complaint alleged only that PNB had not approved the claim, but fatally omitted the essential allegation that the obligation *did not appear in the books* [3, 4].

Since the liability arose from a contract, the essential conditions stipulated in the agreement giving rise to such liability must be alleged; otherwise, no cause of action accrues [4]. A positive allegation that the debt was in the books could actually negate the third-party defendants' liability under the contract terms [3].

The Order of the lower court is **AFFIRMED**.
