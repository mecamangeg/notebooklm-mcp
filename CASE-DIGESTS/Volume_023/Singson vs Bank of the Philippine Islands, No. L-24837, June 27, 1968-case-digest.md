I. CAPTION
JULIAN C. SINGSON and RAMONA DEL CASTILLO v. BANK OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS and SANTIAGO FREIXAS, G.R. No. L-24837, June 27, 1968, 23 SCRA 1117, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Julian C. Singson was a co-defendant in a separate civil case where judgment became final and executory only against his co-defendant, Villa-Abrille & Co. A writ of garnishment was served on the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) regarding Villa-Abrille's deposits. A BPI clerk, upon seeing Singson's name in the title of the writ, erroneously garnished Singson's account without verifying the body of the writ. Consequently, two checks issued by Singson were dishonored, leading to the closure of his credit account with a payee, B.M. Glass Service. Upon Singson's complaint, BPI President Santiago Freixas immediately verified the error, apologized, and lifted the garnishment. Singson sued BPI and Freixas for damages. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that the plaintiffs could not recover based on quasi-delict because the relationship between the parties was contractual.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the existence of a contractual relationship between the bank and the depositor bars the recovery of damages based on tort or quasi-delict.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, reiterating the rule that the existence of a contract between the parties does not bar the commission of a tort by one against the other and the consequent recovery of damages [1]. The Court cited *Air France v. Carrascoso*, holding that while the relation between a passenger and a carrier is contractual, the act that breaks the contract may also be a tort [1]. BPI's negligence in dishonoring the checks despite sufficient funds constituted a violation of Singson's rights. However, considering the mistake was inadvertent and remedied immediately, the Court awarded only P1,000.00 as nominal damages and P500.00 as attorney's fees [2], [3].

**Judgment reversed.**
