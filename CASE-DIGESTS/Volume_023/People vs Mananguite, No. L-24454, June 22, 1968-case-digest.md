I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. VALERIANO MANANGUITE, REYNALDO MORILLO, and EDENCIO MONTAÑO**, G.R. No. L-24454, June 22, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On March 15, 1964, in Mondragon, Samar, Perfecto Navarro was shot and killed. The prosecution charged Chief of Police Valeriano Mananguite, Sgt. Reynaldo Morillo, and Policeman Edencio Montaño with murder, alleging conspiracy. The alleged triggerman, Fidel Cerenado, evaded arrest.

Prosecution witness Gregorio Navarro (victim's brother) testified that he was present and heard Chief Mananguite order Cerenado to shoot Perfecto. Another witness, Paciencia Gulariza, claimed the shooting happened at her house and she also heard the Chief's order.

The Court of First Instance of Samar convicted the three accused of murder, sentencing them to life imprisonment and ordering them to pay P6,000.00 indemnity. The accused appealed, challenging the credibility of the prosecution witnesses and asserting an alibi. Medical evidence revealed discrepancies with Gregorio’s testimony regarding the number and trajectory of wounds. Furthermore, defense evidence indicated Gregorio was incarcerated for drunkenness at the time of the crime, and Paciencia had previously given sworn statements stating she did not know who the killers were because it was dark and she was asleep.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the judgment and acquitted the accused.

The Court held that the prosecution failed to overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence. The testimony of the alleged eyewitnesses was found to be inherently improbable and contradictory to physical evidence. Specifically, the medical report showing only one gunshot wound contradicted Gregorio’s claim of multiple hits while the victim was standing [1, 2]. Additionally, the police blotter showed Gregorio was detained for drunkenness during the incident [2]. Witness Paciencia’s credibility was destroyed by her prior voluntary sworn statement and oral declarations to neighbors and officials immediately after the crime, where she categorically stated she did not know the killers [3-5].

The legal precept in criminal cases is that the burden is on the People to prove the defendant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt (*People v. Graga*; *People v. Cunanan*). Absent such proof, the accused are entitled to acquittal [6, 7].

**Disposition:** Judgment reversed. Defendants-appellants are acquitted. Their immediate release is ordered.
