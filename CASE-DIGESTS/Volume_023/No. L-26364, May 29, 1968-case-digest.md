I. CAPTION
MARIANO A. ALBERT, petitioner, vs. THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA (BR. VI), UNIVERSITY PUBLISHING Co., INC., and JOSE M. ARUEGO, respondents., G.R. No. L-26364, May 29, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Mariano A. Albert (substituted by his estate) sued University Publishing Co., Inc. for breach of contract. The Supreme Court eventually awarded him P15,000.00 in a prior decision (G.R. No. L-15275) [1]. When Albert sought execution, it was discovered that "University Publishing Co., Inc." was not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and thus did not legally exist [2]. Albert then petitioned for a writ of execution against Jose M. Aruego, the company’s President and counsel, personally. The lower court denied this, reasoning Aruego was not a party to the case [3].

On appeal (G.R. No. L-19118), the Supreme Court ruled that the non-existent corporation had no personality separate from Aruego, making him the real defendant. The Court set aside the lower court's order and remanded the case for execution against "University Publishing Co., Inc. and/or Jose M. Aruego" [4, 5]. Despite this final ruling, when Albert returned to the lower court for execution, Aruego again opposed it, presenting belated documents showing the corporation's records had been reconstituted. Judge Gaudencio Cloribel admitted these documents and denied the execution against Aruego, effectively reversing the Supreme Court’s mandate [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the judgment against the non-existent corporation can be executed against Jose M. Aruego personally despite his claim of corporate existence and non-party status.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court granted the petition for certiorari and mandamus, ruling that the liability of Jose M. Aruego had been definitely settled in the previous decision (G.R. No. L-19118) and could no longer be relitigated under the principle of conclusiveness of judgment [8].

The Court held that Aruego, who signed the contract as President of a non-existent entity, was the real party to the suit and had received due process. A person acting on behalf of a corporation with no valid existence becomes personally liable for its acts [9]. Aruego was estopped from claiming corporate existence at the execution stage after concealing the true facts during the trial; he cannot belatedly present reconstituted records to evade a final judgment [10, 11]. The Court condemned the lower court judge for ignoring the clear directive of the Supreme Court to execute judgment against Aruego, emphasizing that the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of legal controversies [12, 13]. Technicalities regarding formal party inclusion must yield to the substance of justice, especially where the real litigant had his day in court [14].

The petition is **GRANTED**; the orders of the lower court are declared **NULL and VOID**; and the lower court is directed to forthwith issue a writ of execution against University Publishing Co., Inc. and/or Jose M. Aruego, with treble costs against Aruego [15].
