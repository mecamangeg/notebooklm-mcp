I. CAPTION
CIRIACO LANDA v. FRANCISCO TOBIAS, Municipal Mayor; EMILIANO DEL CAMPO, Municipal Treasurer; REGIO B. SUBONG, Chief of Police; JUANITO PECATE and JUANITO ALFARO, Municipal Policemen, Cabatuan, Iloilo, G.R. No. L-24490, May 29, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On June 23, 1962, policemen seized a carabao from Ciriaco Landa pursuant to Section 538 of the Revised Administrative Code (RAC). Landa presented a certificate of ownership in the name of Pantaleon Elvas, not himself, and claimed he acquired the animal via barter from Marcelino Mayormente [1]. The certificate bore signs of tampering, specifically erasures regarding the year of issuance and the animal's age [2]. Mayormente allegedly had no title and was later charged with swindling [3]. The police delivered the animal to the Municipal Treasurer, who sold it at public auction as unclaimed property [1]. Landa sued the Mayor, Treasurer, and police for damages. The Justice of the Peace Court ruled for the defendants, and the Court of First Instance dismissed the case [4]. Landa appealed, arguing that his contract was valid under the Civil Code regardless of the lack of registration required by the RAC [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Landa proved valid ownership of the carabao despite the lack of a certificate of transfer.
2. W/N the seizure and subsequent sale of the animal by the public officers were valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Title to large cattle requires the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a certificate of transfer under the Revised Administrative Code [4]. Landa failed to produce such a certificate, and the certificate of ownership he presented was in the name of a third party with no proof of assignment [3]. Furthermore, the certificate showed patent signs of tampering [2]. While Article 1356 of the Civil Code states contracts are obligatory in any form, the specific requisites of the RAC for the transfer of large cattle must be satisfied [4].

2. **YES.** The policemen had reasonable grounds to suspect unlawful possession due to the tampered certificate and lack of transfer documents, justifying the seizure under Section 538 of the RAC [5]. Consequently, the Municipal Treasurer had the duty under Section 540 of the RAC to sell the animal if the owner failed to present themselves and prove title [6]. Landa's remedy was to claim the animal and prove title before the Treasurer prior to the auction, which he failed to do [7]. The sale was valid as Section 540 applies to both estrays and animals seized from persons reasonably suspected of unlawful possession [8]. The presumption that official duty has been regularly performed applies [8]. The order appealed from is affirmed.
