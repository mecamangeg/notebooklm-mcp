I. CAPTION
BISAYA LAND TRANSPORTATION COMPANY, INC. v. MIGUEL CUENCO, G.R. No. L-18173, April 22, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In 1959, the Solicitor General filed a petition for *quo warranto* seeking the dissolution of Bisaya Land Transportation Co., Inc. (Bisaya Land) on the grounds of illegal acts and mismanagement [1, 2]. Miguel Cuenco, a respondent and officer, filed an answer admitting the allegations but disclaiming personal liability. He also filed a cross-claim against the other officers/directors to reimburse the corporation for alleged fraudulent transactions [3].

On August 31, 1959, Cuenco filed a notice of *lis pendens* with the Register of Deeds of Cebu on two titles (TCT Nos. 4293 and 3425) belonging to Bisaya Land [4]. Bisaya Land petitioned the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu to cancel the notice. The CFI ordered the cancellation, ruling the annotation was irregular and unwarranted [4]. Cuenco appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a notice of *lis pendens* is proper in a *quo warranto* proceeding for corporate dissolution involving a cross-claim for monetary reimbursement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the cancellation of the notice. Under Section 24 of Rule 14 of the Rules of Court and Section 79 of the Land Registration Act, a notice of *lis pendens* is available only when the action affects the **title** or the **right of possession** of real property [5].

The Court reasoned that the *quo warranto* petition only put in issue the propriety of the corporation's dissolution, not the title or possession of its lands [6]. While dissolution results in liquidation, this does not convert the proceeding into a real action affecting title [6, 7]. Furthermore, Cuenco’s cross-claim was merely for the reimbursement of money to the corporation [3, 7]. Neither the Republic nor Cuenco claimed ownership of the properties; they admitted ownership lay with the corporation [8]. Consequently, the notice was improper as the action was not a real action affecting the property directly [8].

Decision affirmed [9].
