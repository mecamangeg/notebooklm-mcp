I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROMAN JUGILON, AMANCIO BALATAYO and CRISPIN JAVIER, G.R. No. L-25668, May 2, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On the night of May 26, 1960, elderly spouses Estanislao Jugilon and Emiliana Puyod were robbed and beaten to death in their home in Sapang Dalaga, Misamis Occidental. No arrests were made for nearly a year and a half. In October 1962, Crispin Javier was arrested for theft of coconuts. Upon investigation by the Police Chief, Javier executed an affidavit (Exhibit H) implicating Roman Jugilon and Amancio Balatayo, but claiming he only accompanied them, stayed downstairs, and refused any share of the loot. Subsequently, Jugilon and Balatayo were arrested. Balatayo executed affidavits (Exhibits I and 1-4) stating he and Jugilon agreed to kill the couple and that he heard Jugilon admit the killing to the police. Jugilon did not execute an affidavit, but the prosecution claimed he verbally asked the Police Chief for "help" during investigation. At trial, the accused repudiated the affidavits, alleging force and intimidation. The Court of First Instance convicted all three of robbery with double homicide based on the extrajudicial confessions and *corpus delicti*.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the extrajudicial confessions are admissible and sufficient to convict the accused.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the conviction due to the insufficiency and inadmissibility of the alleged confessions.

Regarding Roman Jugilon, the extrajudicial declarations of his co-accused (Javier and Balatayo) are hearsay and inadmissible against him under the principle of *res inter alios acta* (Sec. 29, Rule 130, Rules of Court) [1, 2]. They could not be admitted as acts of co-conspirators because there was no proof *aliunde* of conspiracy and the declarations were made long after the execution of the offense [2]. Furthermore, Jugilon's alleged verbal statement ("Chief, help me") was not a positive, categorical admission of guilt and could have been a plea of innocence [3].

Regarding Amancio Balatayo, his affidavits did not constitute a confession as he did not positively admit his own guilt [4]. He merely stated an agreement to kill in the first affidavit and imputed the admission of the killing to Jugilon in the second, without admitting actual participation in the commission of the crime [4].

Regarding Crispin Javier, his affidavit was exculpatory rather than inculpatory [5]. He claimed he was unaware of the evil purpose, stayed downstairs, and did not participate in the robbery or killing. An affidavit that contains no admission of participation cannot be relied upon as a confession to convict the affiant [5].

Judgment reversed.
