I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BENJAMIN MAGALLANES, ET AL., defendants, PONTE ABINUMAN, defendant-appellant, G.R. Nos. L-21559-60, June 29, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On May 21, 1962, Moises Espinosa and his companion Marcial Tamares were ambushed at the Masbate wharf, resulting in Tamares' death and serious injuries to Espinosa [1, 2]. The incident stemmed from a deep-seated political rivalry between Espinosa and Mayor Benjamin Magallanes [3]. Accused Manuel Lagarde pleaded guilty to Murder and Frustrated Murder [1]. The Court of First Instance of Masbate tried the remaining accused and acquitted Mayor Magallanes and policemen Arnold Viterbo and Quirino Cornal on reasonable doubt, but convicted Julian Bartido and appellant Ponte Abinuman [4]. The conviction relied on the testimony of the surviving victim, Espinosa, and witness Harry Cortes, who claimed to see Abinuman at the scene with a gun [5, 6]. Abinuman appealed, arguing there was no clear evidence of his direct participation or conspiracy [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Ponte Abinuman's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court found the identification of Abinuman doubtful because the victim, Espinosa, failed to name him immediately after the incident despite knowing him well for three years [8, 9]. In his initial hospital statement, Espinosa identified the assailants as Lagarde, Magallanes, Viterbo, Cornal, and "other policemen," yet Abinuman was a civilian, not a policeman [9]. Additionally, Abinuman tested negative for gunpowder nitrates shortly after the incident, unlike his co-accused Lagarde and Bartido who tested positive [10]. The Court also held that since the trial court rejected the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses regarding the acquitted co-accused (Magallanes, et al.), it was illogical to rely on the same discredited testimonies to convict Abinuman without independent inculpatory evidence [11]. Finally, even if Abinuman had warned Lagarde that the victims were looking for him, such conduct did not establish conspiracy to commit the crimes [12].

Decision reversed. Ponte Abinuman is ACQUITTED.
