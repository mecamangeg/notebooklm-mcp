I. CAPTION
FLORENTINO GENATO, FRANCISCO GENATO, and GENATO COMMERCIAL CORPORATION v. FELISA GENATO DE LORENZO, G.R. No. L-24983, May 20, 1968, J.B.L. Reyes, J.

II. FACTS
Simona B. de Genato owned 530 shares of stock in Genato Commercial Corporation. On December 25, 1942, she allegedly delivered the endorsed share certificates to her son, Florentino Genato, with instructions to transfer them to him and his brother, Francisco Genato [1]. Francisco was not present during this delivery [2]. Acting as Assistant Secretary-Treasurer, Florentino cancelled the original certificates and issued new ones in favor of himself and Francisco [3].

Respondent Felisa Genato de Lorenzo, a co-heir, challenged the transfer. The Court of First Instance (CFI) dismissed her complaint, ruling that a valid simple donation occurred. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the CFI, finding the donation void for lack of proper acceptance and ordering the cancellation of the new certificates to return the shares to the estate [4, 5]. Petitioners appealed, arguing the donation was valid and that Felisa's appeal should not benefit the other non-appealing heirs [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N there was a valid donation of the shares to Florentino and Francisco.
2. W/N the appeal by one heir (Felisa) inures to the benefit of the non-appealing co-heirs.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court affirmed the CA's ruling that there was no valid donation due to lack of proper acceptance. Under Article 630 of the Civil Code of 1889, delivery by the donor and acceptance by the donee must be simultaneous, and acceptance by a person other than the donee must be authorized by a power of attorney in a public document [2]. Francisco was not present at the delivery, and there was no evidence he authorized Florentino to accept on his behalf via a public instrument [2]. Furthermore, since the donation was joint, one donee could not accept for the other because accretion among donees exists only if expressly provided or between spouses, pursuant to Article 637 of the Civil Code [8]. Consequently, the shares remain part of Simona's estate [8].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that where the interests of all heirs are so interwoven as to become inseparable, as in a pending estate liquidation, an appeal by one heir prevents the decision from becoming final as to the others [7]. Thus, the reversal of the lower court's decision obtained by Felisa applies to all heirs, even those who did not appeal, citing *Municipality of Orion v. Concha* [7].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
