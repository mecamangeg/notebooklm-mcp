I. CAPTION
**EUNARIA B. VDA. DE GUILAS, ET AL. v. ANANIAS DAVID, ROSALIO MERCADO, and HON. PASTOR DE GUZMAN**, G.R. No. L-24280, May 27, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners are co-owners of a riceland in Guagua, Pampanga, originally tenanted by respondent David [1]. In 1963, David sold his "right to work" the land to respondent Mercado without the petitioners' knowledge or consent [1]. Mercado subsequently planted rice on the property. To avoid immediate litigation, the parties executed a compromise agreement on November 1, 1963. In this agreement, petitioners desisted from suing in exchange for Mercado's promise to harvest the current crop and surrender the land by January 1964 [2-4].

When Mercado failed to surrender the land in January 1964, petitioners filed an ejectment suit in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) [4]. The CAR dismissed the complaint, ruling that while the initial sale of rights was not binding, the subsequent compromise agreement established a tenancy relationship. Consequently, the CAR held that the agreement to surrender the land in the future was not a valid ground for ejecting a tenant under agrarian laws [5, 6]. Petitioners appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the compromise agreement established a tenancy relationship that entitled Mercado to security of tenure.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CAR's order. The Court held that no tenancy relationship existed because the transfer of rights from David to Mercado was made without the landowners' consent [6, 7]. The compromise agreement did not signify consent to a tenancy; rather, it was executed precisely because petitioners were *unwilling* to accept Mercado as a tenant and were ready to sue him for usurpation [6].

The agreement was a compromise where petitioners agreed to desist from filing a case in exchange for Mercado's specific promise to vacate. Under **Article 2037 of the Civil Code**, such a compromise has the effect of *res judicata* upon the parties [8]. When Mercado failed to comply, petitioners were entitled under **Article 2041 of the Civil Code** to either enforce the compromise or regard it as rescinded [8]. Since Mercado was not a lawful tenant, he could not invoke the security of tenure provisions under the Agricultural Tenancy Law [9, 10].

The Order appealed from was **REVERSED**, and the case was **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [8].
