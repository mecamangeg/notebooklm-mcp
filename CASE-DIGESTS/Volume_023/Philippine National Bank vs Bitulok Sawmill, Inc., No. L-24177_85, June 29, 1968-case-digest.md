I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. BITULOK SAWMILL, INC., DINGALAN LUMBER CO., INC., SIERRA MADRE LUMBER CO., INC., NASIPIT LUMBER CO., INC., WOODWORKS, INC., GONZALO PUYAT, TOMAS B. MORATO, FINDLAY MILLAR LUMBER CO., INC., INSULAR LUMBER CO., ANAKAN LUMBER CO., AND CANTILAN LUMBER CO., INC., G.R. Nos. L-24177–85, June 29, 1968, 23 SCRA 1366, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
In 1947, the Philippine Lumber Distributing Agency, Inc. (PLDA) was organized at the initiative of then-President Manuel Roxas to break the alien monopoly on lumber retail. To convince reluctant lumber producers (respondents) to subscribe, President Roxas promised that the Government would invest P9.00 for every P1.00 contributed by the members. Relying on this assurance, respondents subscribed to PLDA's capital stock. However, the Legislature did not appropriate the counterpart funds, and the Government failed to invest the promised amount. PLDA later obtained an overdraft from the Philippine National Bank (PNB), which it failed to pay.

PNB, substituting the receiver of PLDA, filed nine actions to recover the balance of the respondents' unpaid stock subscriptions to satisfy the debt. The Court of First Instance of Manila acknowledged PNB's legal right to collect but dismissed the cases on grounds of equity, ruling it unfair to compel payment when the President's assurance—the inducement for the subscriptions—was not fulfilled. PNB appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondents are released from their obligation to pay the balance of their stock subscriptions due to the Government's failure to provide the promised counterpart funding.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court, holding that the "equity of the case" cannot override a plain statutory command.

Applying the doctrine in *Velasco v. Poizat* (37 Phil. 802), the Court reiterated that subscriptions to the capital of a corporation constitute a fund to which creditors have a right to look for satisfaction of their claims. A corporation has no power to release an original subscriber from the obligation of paying for their shares without valuable consideration. As against creditors, a reduction of capital stock can only take place under conditions prescribed by the statute.

Furthermore, the Court ruled that the President does not have the prerogative to suspend the operation of any statute or its terms. Even if President Roxas gave such assurances to further a laudable purpose, he could not validly waive the statutory liability of subscribers. Under the Constitution, the power to suspend laws belongs to the Legislature, and the President is enjoined to execute the laws faithfully.

WHEREFORE, the decision of the lower court is reversed and the cases remanded to the lower court for judgment according to law.
