I. CAPTION
AMERICAN MACHINERY & PARTS MANUFACTURING, INC. v. HAMBURG-AMERIKA LINIE, ET AL., MANILA RAILROAD CO. and MANILA PORT SERVICE, G.R. No. L-21497, April 16, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff American Machinery & Parts Manufacturing, Inc. was the consignee of a shipment of 132 lifts of steel bars and tubes discharged into the custody of defendant Manila Port Service (MPS), the arrastre operator and subsidiary of Manila Railroad Co. [1, 2]. When the plaintiff took delivery, there was a shortage of three (3) lifts valued at P4,264.95 [2]. The plaintiff filed a suit for recovery of the value. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the plaintiff, ordering MPS to pay the full invoice value. The lower court held that the consignee was not bound by Section 15 of the Arrastre Management Contract—which limits liability to P500.00 per package—because the Delivery Permit furnished to the plaintiff did not refer to said section [3, 4]. MPS appealed, arguing its liability should be limited based on the notice printed on the Gate Passes used by the consignee [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the arrastre operator’s liability is limited to P500.00 per package under the Management Contract, even if the Delivery Permit did not explicitly reference the limitation provision.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court modified the lower court's decision, holding that the arrastre operator's liability is limited.

While the Delivery Permit did not contain a reference to Section 15 of the Management Contract, the **Gate Passes** (Exhibits N, N-1, and N-2) used by the consignee to withdraw the goods explicitly printed the provision limiting liability to P500.00 per package unless a higher value is declared [6, 7]. The Court held that the consignee is bound by the Management Contract provisions when it uses documents (like gate passes) that make reference to Section 15 and substantially reproduce its provisions [8]. Since the consignee had to use the gate passes to obtain delivery, the printed paragraph thereon constituted sufficient notice of the limited liability clause [9]. Citing *Villanueva v. Barber-Wilhemsen Lines*, the Court reiterated that such notice binds the consignee even if they are not a party to the Management Contract [8].

Consequently, the liability of the defendants-appellants was reduced to P1,500.00 (P500.00 for each of the 3 missing lifts) with legal interest [9, 10].
