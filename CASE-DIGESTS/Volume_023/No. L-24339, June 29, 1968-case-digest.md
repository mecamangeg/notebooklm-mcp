I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FELIX LAVARIAS, G.R. No. L-24339, June 29, 1968, 23 SCRA 1301, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On the early morning of May 1, 1963, in Barrio Pangascasan, Bugallon, Pangasinan, a group of robbers stole three heads of cattle from Bartolome Malong. During the robbery, shots were fired, killing Malong's wife, Presentacion, and seriously injuring his daughter, Levi. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan convicted Felix Lavarias of robbery with homicide and serious physical injuries based solely on affidavits previously executed by Bartolome Malong and another witness, Alejandro Capua, which identified Lavarias as one of the perpetrators. However, during the trial, both witnesses repudiated these affidavits. Malong testified that he could not identify the accused because it was dark and he was attending to his wounded family. Capua testified that he did not see anything as he was inside his closed store during the incident. Lavarias appealed, arguing the insufficiency of the identification.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the conviction of the accused can be sustained based on affidavits identifying him which were subsequently repudiated by the witnesses during the trial.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that a conviction cannot be predicated on mere affidavits executed by alleged eyewitnesses who, during the trial, repudiated the same and failed to identify the perpetrator [1]. The constitutional right to confrontation requires that the accused be tried by witnesses who meet him face-to-face at trial and whom he is given the opportunity to cross-examine [2]. To convict an accused solely on *ex parte* affidavits would disregard this valuable constitutional guarantee, especially when the affiants themselves testified in court that they could not identify the appellant [3].

The presumption of innocence is bolstered by the positive and categorical testimony of the witnesses at trial that the accused could not be identified [4]. Only by proof beyond reasonable doubt, which requires moral certainty, may the presumption of innocence be overcome (*U.S. v. Reyes*) [4]. Since the identification was inadequate and the affidavits were repudiated, the prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

The judgment appealed from is **REVERSED** and appellant Felix Lavarias is **ACQUITTED** [5].
