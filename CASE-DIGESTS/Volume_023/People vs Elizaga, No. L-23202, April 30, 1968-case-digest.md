I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROMARICO ELIZAGA, VENERANDO TOBIAS, CARLITO CABIERA, JAIME DE LA CRUZ, VICENTE CORTEZ and CRESENCIO ELIZAGA, G.R. No. L-23202, April 30, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of June 26, 1963, in Faire, Cagayan, the house of Antonio Singson was showered with bullets, killing Rodolfo Paulino [1, 2]. Prior to this, Singson and accused Romarico Elizaga had strained relations due to business competition and pending court cases [3, 4]. PC soldiers, hearing the gunfire and seeing men running from Singson's house towards the river, pursued the group [5]. They apprehended eight persons boarding a banca, including the accused-appellants [5]. One accused, Vicente Cortez, was found wounded in the banca, and firearms were later retrieved from the river bottom [5, 6].

Cresencio Elizaga executed an extrajudicial confession detailing the plot but later repudiated it, claiming it was extracted through force and intimidation [7]. The Court of First Instance convicted Romarico, Cresencio, Venerando Tobias, Carlito Cabiera, Jaime de la Cruz, and Vicente Cortez of murder, sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua* [8]. Romarico Elizaga died pending appeal [9]. The remaining appellants challenged the admissibility of the confession and the sufficiency of the evidence [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the extrajudicial confession of Cresencio Elizaga is admissible.
2. W/N the circumstantial evidence is sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
3. W/N the crime committed is murder.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The confession is admissible. The Court held that the details narrated in the confession could not have been concocted by a stranger to the crime [10]. The claim of maltreatment was unsubstantiated; the examining physician did not record any injuries, and the accused failed to complain to the Justice of the Peace during swearing [10, 11]. Furthermore, the confession was corroborated by evidence *aliunde* (such as the flight of the accused and the recovery of firearms) which dovetailed with the essential facts admitted [12].

2. **YES (as to Cresencio, Jaime, and Vicente); NO (as to Tobias and Cabiera).** For Cresencio, Jaime, and Vicente, the events constituted a "compact mass of circumstantial evidence" pointing to them as the perpetrators [13]. The chain of circumstances—from their presence near the scene, their flight upon the arrival of soldiers, to their capture in the banca with a wounded companion—sufficed to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt [13]. However, regarding Venerando Tobias and Carlito Cabiera, their specific participation was not clearly proven; evidence suggested they merely followed the group, entitling them to acquittal on reasonable doubt [14].

3. **YES.** The Court ruled that showering a house with bullets, knowing it to be inhabited, is clear proof of intent to kill [15]. The attack was qualified by treachery because it was executed at night using means that insured the execution of the crime without risk to the attackers from any defense the victims might make [15].

The decision of the lower court was **MODIFIED**. The conviction of Cresencio Elizaga, Jaime de la Cruz, and Vicente Cortez for murder is **AFFIRMED** (*reclusion perpetua*), while Venerando Tobias and Carlito Cabiera are **ACQUITTED** [16].
