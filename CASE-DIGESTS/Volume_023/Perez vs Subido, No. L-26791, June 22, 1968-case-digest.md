I. CAPTION
TOMAS M. PEREZ v. ABELARDO SUBIDO, in his capacity as Commissioner of Civil Service; MANUEL CUDIAMAT and JOSE ERESTAIN, in their capacities as City Treasurer and City Auditor, respectively, of the City of Manila, G.R. No. L-26791, June 22, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On November 24, 1962, petitioner Tomas M. Perez took the Patrolman Examinations. In his application, he answered "Yes" to a question asking if he had ever been accused of or tried for a violation of law, but he listed only two criminal cases, omitting two others (attempted corruption of a public official and gambling) which had been dismissed prior to the examination [1, 2]. Perez passed the exam, underwent character investigation and training, and was appointed as a patrolman in the Manila Police Department in May 1963. His appointment and subsequent promotion were approved by respondent Commissioner of Civil Service Abelardo Subido [2].

On October 20, 1965, Commissioner Subido sent a letter to the Manila City Mayor invalidating Perez’s examination papers, canceling his eligibility, and terminating his services because of the omission in his application. This was done without a hearing [3]. The Mayor found no ground to dismiss Perez, but the City Treasurer and Auditor stopped paying his salary based on the Commissioner's order. Perez filed a petition for *mandamus* with the Court of First Instance of Manila, which ruled in his favor and declared the Commissioner's order null and void [4]. The Commissioner appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Commissioner of Civil Service has the authority to invalidate examination papers, cancel eligibility, and terminate a civil service employee's services *ex parte* (without a hearing).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Commissioner of Civil Service lacks the power to cancel a patrolman's civil service eligibility or terminate his employment without a formal investigation [6].

The Court emphasized that cancelling eligibility and dismissing an employee without a hearing violates the constitutional right to due process [7]. Under Rule II, Article 4 of the Civil Service Rules, removal is warranted only when an applicant "**intentionally** makes a false statement." Good faith is always presumed, and an incorrect answer does not automatically imply intent to deceive without an inquiry [8]. Furthermore, Section 32 of the Civil Service Law of 1959 reinforces the constitutional guarantee of security of tenure, stating that no officer or employee in the civil service shall be removed or suspended except for cause and after due process, which includes the right to a formal investigation [9]. Relying on the doctrine in *Abaya v. Villegas*, the Court reiterated that a civil service employee must be heard before being condemned [5].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed [10].
