I. CAPTION
ELISEO EGUIA DUMAPIG v. HON. GERONIMO R. MARAVE, THE CITY FISCAL and/or THE SPECIAL COUNSEL OF OZAMIZ CITY, G.R. No. L-25308, May 22, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Dumapig and others were charged with murder and assault upon an agent of a person in authority before the Court of First Instance of Ozamiz City [1]. After the prosecution rested its case, the defense filed a motion to dismiss (demurrer to evidence), which respondent Judge Marave denied [1, 2]. The defense subsequently moved to postpone the continuation of the trial multiple times on the ground that the transcript of stenographic notes (TSN) of the prosecution witnesses' testimony was not yet available [2]. While the court granted some postponements, it eventually denied the defense's motion for an indefinite postponement until the TSN was filed and warned that no further postponements would be granted [3]. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition, arguing that the denial of the indefinite postponement violated his right to defend himself properly [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused is entitled to wait for the transcript of stenographic notes of the prosecution witnesses before being compelled to present evidence for the defense.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that there is no legal provision supporting the view that the transcript of stenographic notes must be made available to the accused before he presents his evidence [4]. The Court emphasized that it is the duty of defense counsel to take notes, whether complete or incomplete, of the testimony of prosecution witnesses during the hearing to enable him to present whatever evidence is necessary to prove the innocence of his client [4]. Furthermore, under the Rules, the only time entitlement for the accused to prepare for trial is the period of two days after arraignment, which the petitioner had already enjoyed [5].

Accordingly, the petition was **DISMISSED** and the writs prayed for were **DENIED**. The case was remanded to the lower court for the immediate continuation of the trial [5].
