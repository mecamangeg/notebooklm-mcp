**I. CAPTION**
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. REFUGIO DEVARAS, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-25165, May 23, 1968, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
In the appeal of defendant-appellant Enrique Salve, the Supreme Court had previously granted the Solicitor General a 20th extension to file the appellee's brief. Subsequently, the Solicitor General filed successive motions for extension of time on February 15, February 20, March 7, March 21, April 2, and April 22, 1968. These petitions remained act upon by the Court for a significant period because the *rollo* (record) of the case had been misplaced [1-4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the motions for extension of time to file the appellee's brief should be granted despite the delay.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court granted all the petitions for extension. The Court reasoned that the petitions had remained unresolved solely because the *rollo* of the case was misplaced [4]. To remedy the situation, the Court resolved to grant all the filed petitions. Regarding the most recent petition, the Court granted a fifteen-day period computed from May 16, 1968, with the warning that this should be considered the "last and final extension" [1, 4].
