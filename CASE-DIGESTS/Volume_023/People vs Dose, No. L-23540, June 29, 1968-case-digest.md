I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PACIFICO DOSE and DIOSDADO DESCARES, G.R. No. L-23540, June 29, 1968, 23 SCRA 1345, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On January 17, 1964, the Provincial Fiscal of Iloilo filed an information in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo accusing Pacifico Dose and Diosdado Descares of illegal possession of firearms for possessing a Colt super .38 automatic pistol without a license [1]. On August 4, 1964, the CFI issued an order declaring it had no original jurisdiction over the case and remanded it to the Municipal Court of Dumangas [2]. The Fiscal moved for reconsideration, arguing that under Section 44(f) of the Judiciary Act of 1948, the CFI had concurrent jurisdiction [2]. The CFI denied the motion on August 20, 1964 [2]. The People of the Philippines appealed the orders to the Supreme Court on a question of law [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has concurrent original jurisdiction with the Municipal Court over the crime of illegal possession of firearms [3].

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the Court of First Instance and the Municipal Courts have concurrent original jurisdiction to try criminal cases involving illegal possession of firearms [4].

The Court applied the doctrine in *Natividad v. Robles*, holding that Section 44(f) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 (R.A. No. 296)—which vests CFIs with jurisdiction over offenses punishable by imprisonment of more than six months or a fine exceeding P200.00—must be construed together with Section 87(b), which grants specific jurisdiction to municipal courts [5]. Under Republic Act No. 4, illegal possession of firearms is punishable by imprisonment of not less than one year and one day [6]. Since the penalty exceeds the jurisdictional threshold of six months, the enlargement of the municipal court's jurisdiction did not divest the CFI of its existing jurisdiction, resulting in concurrent jurisdiction [7].

The appealed orders were **SET ASIDE**, and the case was **REMANDED** to the Court of First Instance of Iloilo for trial on the merits [4].
