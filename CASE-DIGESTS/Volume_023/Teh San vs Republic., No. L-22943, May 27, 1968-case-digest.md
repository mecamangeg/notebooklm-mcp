**I. CAPTION**
TEH SAN *alias* LEOVIGILDO TEH SAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22943, May 27, 1968, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
On September 3, 1960, Teh San filed a petition for naturalization, averring that he had an average annual income of P4,000.00 to support himself, a wife, and six children [1]. His income tax returns presented a different picture: his 1959 return showed a gross income of P2,405.54 (net income of P1,652.44), while his 1960 return showed a gross income of P3,511.93 (net income of P3,195.83) [1]. On April 19, 1962, the Court of First Instance of Quezon rendered a judgment declaring the petitioner eligible for Philippine citizenship [2]. The Republic of the Philippines appealed this decision to the Supreme Court [2, 3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner possesses the required lucrative income to qualify for naturalization.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner does not meet the requirement of a lucrative income [1]. The Court reiterated the rule established in *Choa vs. Republic* that income "is to be reckoned as of the time of the filing of the application" [1]. Considering the petitioner had to support a wife and six children at the time he filed his petition in 1960, his reported net incomes of P1,652.44 (for 1959) and P3,195.83 (for 1960) were insufficient to satisfy the legal requirement for a lucrative trade, profession, or occupation [1].

Consequently, the judgment of the lower court is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DENIED** [4].
