I. CAPTION
REGINA ANTONIO, ET AL. v. PELAGIO BARROGA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23769, April 29, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Regina Antonio and her co-plaintiffs filed a complaint to annul Free Patent No. 26383 and Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 2799 issued to defendants Pelagio and Marcelo Barroga. Plaintiffs claimed their deceased father, Jorge Antonio, was the true owner of the land in Urdaneta, Pangasinan [1]. The Barrogas subsequently mortgaged and sold the property to co-defendants [1].

In their answer, the Barrogas alleged that their predecessor-in-interest, Eusebio Rellera, was the absolute owner of the land by virtue of *Titulo Real No. 12479* issued in 1894 [2]. Seizing on this, plaintiffs argued that the Barrogas' admission of the existence of a *Titulo Real* meant the land was private property, and thus the Director of Lands had no authority to dispose of it via a free patent [3]. The Director of Lands moved to dismiss on the ground that the cause of action was barred [3]. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan dismissed the complaint [1, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the issuance of a free patent is void because the applicant admitted the land was previously covered by a *Titulo Real*.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the filing of an application for a free patent over land covered by a *Titulo Real* is not a ground for the annulment of said free patent [5]. It was the applicant's privilege to rely or not to rely upon his claim of private ownership under the *Titulo Real*. Pelagio Barroga chose not to rely on it and instead considered the property as part of the public domain [6].

The Court explained that a *Titulo Real* is not an indefeasible title; its holder must prove continuous possession for ten years by virtue of a good title and in good faith, pursuant to the **Royal Decree of June 25, 1880** [6]. Presuming Barroga lacked sufficient evidence to prove such possession, he validly opted to acquire the land as part of the public domain [6]. Furthermore, since the complaint to annul the patent was filed many years after it had become final and indefeasible, the facts alleged constituted no cause of action [7]. The order appealed from is affirmed [7].
