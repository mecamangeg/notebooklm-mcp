**I. CAPTION**
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MANUEL FONTILLAS, VENERANDO VELES, and TEODULFO VELES**, G.R. No. L-25298, April 16, 1968, Angeles, J.

**II. FACTS**
On October 22, 1963, at around 6:00 P.M., six armed men entered the well-lit general merchandise store of Alfonso Yu in Las Nieves, Butuan City. The group included appellants Manuel Fontillas, Venerando Veles, and Teodulfo Veles, along with Manuel Mango and Sofronio Balbuena (who were later killed during the incident) and Nicolas Veles. They held Alfonso Yu and others at gunpoint, ransacked the store, and took cash and goods. During the robbery, Alfonso Yu and his son Victor Yu were killed [1-5]. Prosecution witnesses Alfreda Layno, Emma Yu, and Jose Yu positively identified the appellants, as the store was well-lighted and the robbers were unmasked [2, 6, 7]. The appellants raised the defense of alibi, claiming they were at a thanksgiving party for a "good harvest" at the house of Estanislao Cataluña [8]. The Court of First Instance of Agusan convicted the three appellants of robbery with double homicide and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua*, while acquitting Nicolas Veles on reasonable doubt [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the appellants' guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt despite their defense of alibi.
2. W/N conspiracy existed among the accused to warrant collective liability for the killings.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the defense of alibi cannot prevail over the clear and positive identification of the appellants by prosecution witnesses who observed them from vantage positions in a well-lighted area [9, 10]. The Court found the alibi incredible; the appellants claimed to be celebrating a "good harvest," yet their alleged host admitted on the stand that there was actually no harvest that year due to a flood [11, 12]. Furthermore, the trial court's assessment of witness credibility is generally sustained on appeal unless facts of weight were overlooked [13, 14].

2. **YES.** The Court held that conspiracy was proven because the acts of the appellants, collectively and individually executed, demonstrated a common design toward the accomplishment of the unlawful purpose [15-17]. Once conspiracy is established, all appellants are liable for the complex crime of robbery with homicide, as the killing happened on the occasion of the robbery, regardless of which specific individual inflicted the fatal blows [16, 17].

**Decision affirmed.**
