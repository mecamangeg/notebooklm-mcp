**I. CAPTION**
SIMEON CORDOVIS, ET AL. v. BASILISA A. DE OBIAS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-24080, April 26, 1968, J.B.L. Reyes, Actg. C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondents (Obias, et al.) previously filed an action to quiet title (Civil Case No. 3660) against Petitioners (Cordovis, et al.) over two parcels of land in Camarines Sur. The Court of Appeals (CA) eventually ruled in favor of Respondents, declaring them rightful owners and possessors. This decision became final and executory [1, 2].

Subsequently, Petitioners filed a new complaint (Civil Case No. T-115) to annul the CA judgment. They alleged that Respondents obtained the favorable judgment through fraud by falsely stating under oath that they were in possession of the lands, when in truth, Petitioners were in possession. Petitioners also cited a prior dismissal of a forcible entry case filed by Respondents [3].

The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint for annulment, ruling that the alleged fraud was not extrinsic and that the judgment was *res judicata* [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the alleged false testimony regarding possession constitutes extrinsic fraud sufficient to annul a final judgment.
2. W/N the dismissal of the complaint for annulment was proper.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that not every fraud serves as a ground to annul a judgment. Fraud is regarded as **extrinsic or collateral** when it prevents a party from having a trial or presenting their case (e.g., collusion), which may justify annulment. In contrast, **intrinsic fraud** refers to matters put in issue and presented for adjudication, including false testimony or fraudulent instruments [5, 6]. The Petitioners' allegation that Respondents perjured themselves regarding possession constitutes intrinsic fraud because possession was a matter specifically litigated and considered in the prior quiet title case. Thus, it is not a valid ground to annul the judgment [7, 8].

2. **YES.** Although the doctrine of *res judicata* technically cannot be invoked when the specific purpose of the action is to annul that very judgment, the dismissal was correct because the complaint **failed to state a cause of action** sufficient to invalidate the previous final judgment [9, 10]. Furthermore, the Court noted that the alleged prior decision in a forcible entry case is conclusive only regarding possession and does not bar an action respecting ownership, such as quieting of title [11, 12].

The Order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED** [13].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Dizon, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred. Chief Justice Concepcion was on leave [13].
