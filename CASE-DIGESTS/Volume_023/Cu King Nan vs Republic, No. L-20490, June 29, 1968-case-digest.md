I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF RAMON CU KING NAN, alias CHUA TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. RAMON CU KING NAN, alias CHUA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20490, June 29, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ramon Cu King Nan filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija on September 5, 1960 [1]. He alleged that he was a resident of San Jose, Nueva Ecija, with a former residence in Muñoz; that he was married with eight children; and that he had an average annual income of P8,000 to P9,000 [1]. He presented two character witnesses, Eulogio Santa Maria and Simplicio Andres [2]. The lower court granted the petition [3]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that the character witnesses were not credible, the children's education requirement was not met, and the marriage was not proven [3]. Upon review, the Supreme Court also noted discrepancies in the publication of the notice and the petitioner's financial capacity [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the publication of the notice of hearing was valid despite omitting the petitioner's former residence.
2. W/N the petitioner satisfied the lucrative income requirement.
3. W/N the character witnesses were credible.
4. W/N the petitioner sufficiently proved his marriage and compliance with the education requirement.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The omission of the statement of the petitioner's former place of residence in the published notice of hearing is a fatal defect in the proceedings [4]. The publication must contain present and former residences to invite comment from all who knew the petitioner in places he resided [4].

2. **NO.** Financial capability is determined at the time of filing. An income of P8,000 to P9,000 is insufficient to support a wife and eight children [5]. Furthermore, a discrepancy between the petitioner's Income Tax Return (showing P16,482.47 business income) and his Residence Certificate Class B (showing only P5,400 salary) suggests either inflated returns for the petition or tax evasion, rendering him morally unfit [6].

3. **NO.** The witnesses' knowledge of the petitioner was based on occasional meetings and their testimony was too general to reliably certify his irreproachable moral character [7, 8].

4. **NO.** The fact of marriage must be established by clear evidence (e.g., marriage certificate), which was not presented; testimony and an Alien Certificate of Registration are insufficient [9, 10]. Additionally, there was no proof that the schools attended by his children prescribed Philippine history, government, and civics [11].

The decision of the lower court is REVERSED and the petition is DENIED [12].
