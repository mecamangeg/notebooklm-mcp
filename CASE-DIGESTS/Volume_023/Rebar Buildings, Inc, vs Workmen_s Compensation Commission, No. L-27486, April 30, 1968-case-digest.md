**I. CAPTION**
REBAR BUILDINGS, INC. vs. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and DESIDERIO LUCERO, G.R. No. L-27486, April 30, 1968, Castro, J.

**II. FACTS**
Desiderio Lucero worked as a welder for petitioner Rebar Buildings, Inc. from 1953 to 1958. His duties involved lifting heavy steel frameworks in a dusty, hot environment (up to 95°C). In 1958, while working, Lucero spat blood and was later diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). He reported the incident to the company accountant, Luis Magsalin, and received P120.00 for medical expenses. When he requested lighter work, he was refused and subsequently dismissed on April 6, 1958.

Lucero filed a claim for disability compensation on November 19, 1962. The Regional Office dismissed the claim, ruling it was time-barred and questioning his employment. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed the decision, finding the illness service-connected and ruling that the company failed to seasonably controvert the claim.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the claimant's illness (PTB) is compensable under the Workmen’s Compensation Act.
2. W/N the claim is barred by prescription or laches due to the delay in filing.
3. W/N the failure to give written notice of sickness bars the claim.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court applied the statutory presumption of compensability under Section 44(1) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act. The law presumes that a claim is compensable in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary. Since Lucero was healthy when admitted to service and contracted the illness after five years of strenuous work, the "conclusion is ineluctable that the claimant’s illness was contracted during the course of his employment" [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The company forfeited its right to contest the claim because it failed to file a notice of controversion as required by Section 45 of the Act. The company had actual knowledge of the illness when Lucero reported spitting blood to the accountant and received financial aid. Despite this knowledge, the company failed to submit the required report under Section 37 or controvert the claim within the statutory period [3].

3. **NO.** A written notice of sickness under Section 25 of the Act is not necessary where the employer has actual knowledge of the ailment and has even paid the claimant P120.00 for medical expenses and financial help [4].

The judgment of the WCC is affirmed in toto [4].
