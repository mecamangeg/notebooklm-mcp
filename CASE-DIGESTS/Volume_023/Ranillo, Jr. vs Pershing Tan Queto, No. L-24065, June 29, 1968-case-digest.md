I. CAPTION
MATIAS RANILLO, JR. v. PERSHING TAN QUETO, ANTONIO YAP HOCKUN, COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MISAMIS OCCIDENTAL, OZAMIS CITY BRANCH, and THE SHERIFF OF QUEZON CITY, G.R. No. L-24065, June 29, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On April 29, 1957, the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental rendered a decision in Civil Case No. 1828 ordering Matias Ranillo, Jr. and his co-defendants to pay Pershing Tan Queto and Antonio Yap Hockun damages and attorney’s fees. The defendants appealed, but the appeal was dismissed on July 9, 1958. A subsequent petition for mandamus to compel the lower court to give due course to the appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court on October 16, 1958.

Initial writs of execution issued in 1958 and 1959 were returned unsatisfied. Years later, upon discovering Ranillo had properties in Quezon City, the respondents filed a motion for the issuance of an alias writ of execution. The lower court granted this motion on July 27, 1964. Ranillo challenged this order, arguing that the writ could no longer be issued by mere motion as more than five years had elapsed since the judgment became final.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the judgment may be executed by a mere motion filed on July 27, 1964.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the lower court acted without jurisdiction. Under Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, a judgment may be executed on motion within five (5) years from the date of its entry or from the date it becomes final and executory. After the lapse of such time, and before it is barred by the statute of limitations, a judgment may be enforced only by an independent action.

Whether the five-year period is reckoned from the dismissal of the appeal on July 9, 1958, or even from the dismissal of the mandamus petition on October 16, 1958, more than five years had elapsed when the lower court issued the order on July 27, 1964. Consequently, the judgment had been reduced to a mere right of action which must be enforced by the institution of a complaint in the regular form (revival of judgment).

The petition is granted, and the order dated July 27, 1964 is annulled.
