I. CAPTION
JOHN I. NEVANS, VICTOR M. NALUS and LUZON BROKERAGE COMPANY, INC. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, LUZON BROKERAGE SUPERVISORS' UNION (PTGWO) and GUILLERMO STA. ANA, G.R. No. L-21510, June 29, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Guillermo Sta. Ana was the Head Checker of petitioner Luzon Brokerage Company. On August 11, 1960, he supervised the loading of four cases of merchandise. He ordered one case unloaded in front of the company office, while the truck delivered the remaining three to the consignee, Shurdut Mill Supply & Co. The unloaded case, containing saw teeth valued at P2,887.28, subsequently disappeared. Police investigation revealed statements from co-workers (a driver and helpers) implicating Sta. Ana as the mastermind who ordered the box left behind and later shared proceeds from its sale.

Consequently, the Company suspended Sta. Ana on August 24, 1960, and dismissed him on September 23, 1960, for implication in pilferage and negligence. Sta. Ana and the Union filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP), alleging he was dismissed due to union activities and a 1957 grudge held by Office Manager Victor Nalus regarding a hiring recommendation. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled in favor of Sta. Ana, finding the petitioners guilty of ULP and ordering his reinstatement with backpay. The petitioners appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of Sta. Ana constitutes Unfair Labor Practice.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CIR decision. The Court found the CIR's conclusion that the dismissal was due to union activities to be based on "pure and simple speculation." Sta. Ana had been a union member since 1953 and an officer since 1957, yet he received promotions and salary increases from Nalus in 1959 and 1960, which negated the claim that Nalus harbored a grudge or anti-union bias.

Conversely, the petitioners had valid grounds for the dismissal. The Court held that where an employer has reasonable grounds to believe, if not to entertain the moral conviction, that an employee was responsible for the loss of valuable goods, and that the nature of his participation rendered him absolutely unworthy of the trust and confidence demanded by his position, the dismissal does not constitute unfair labor practice. The statements from Sta. Ana's co-workers and the police findings provided reasonable grounds for the Company to lose confidence in him. The dismissal was a valid measure to punish the act, deter others, and protect the Company's reputation.

The petition was granted, and the complaint for unfair labor practice was dismissed.
