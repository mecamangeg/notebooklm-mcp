I. CAPTION
**REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FRANCISCO COKENG**, G.R. No. L-19829, May 4, 1968, 23 SCRA 559, Reyes, J.B.L., Actg. C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent-appellee Francisco Cokeng was granted Philippine citizenship on December 29, 1958. On March 7, 1961, the Solicitor General filed a petition for denaturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, seeking to cancel Cokeng's naturalization certificate on two grounds: (1) failure to disclose all present and past places of residence in his application, specifically a residence at 28, 12th Street, Quezon City; and (2) underdeclaration of income. The CFI denied the petition, but the Supreme Court, in a decision promulgated on July 30, 1966, reversed the lower court and ordered the cancellation of the certificate.

Cokeng filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the Quezon City house was not his "legal domicile" but merely a place he visited or used as an address, and that his failure to list it was in good faith. He further contended that subsequent investigations by the Bureau of Internal Revenue showed he had not evaded taxes.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the failure to state a former place of actual residence in a naturalization application, regardless of good faith, renders the naturalization certificate "illegally procured" and subject to cancellation.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that Section 7 of the Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473) expressly requires the applicant to state his "present and past places of residence." The term "residence" in the statute refers to "actual physical residence," whether temporary or permanent, and not merely "legal domicile," because the law's purpose is to enable the public and investigating agencies to gather all information regarding the applicant's conduct and irreproachability.

The Court ruled that the applicant's good faith in omitting a place of residence is irrelevant. Whether the omission is in good or bad faith, it prevents full inquiry into the applicant's behavior and frustrates the intent of the law. Such omission is fatal to the application [1]. Under Section 18 of C.A. No. 473, a naturalization certificate may be cancelled if "illegally procured." Citing US jurisprudence (*U.S. v. Ness*, *U.S. v. Beda*), the Court explained that "illegally procured" is not limited to fraud but denotes a determination contrary to law or non-compliance with statutory requirements [2]-[3]. Although the Court conceded that the charge of underdeclaration of income was not clearly established due to conflicting BIR reports [4], the fatal defect regarding the non-disclosure of residence remained sufficient ground for denaturalization.

The Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Dizon, J. (Concurring and Dissenting):** Concurred that tax evasion was not established. Dissented on the residence issue, arguing that the Quezon City house was likely just an address for visiting his father and not a residence. Citing *Schneiderman v. U.S.*, he argued that denaturalization requires clear justification and facts should be construed in favor of the citizen [5]-[6].

**Castro, J. (Separate Opinion):** Voted to grant the motion. He argued the Quezon City house was not a "residence" (place of abode with intent to remain) and that evidence for denaturalization must be "clear, unequivocal and convincing," which the State failed to provide [7]-[8].

**Angeles, J. (Dissenting):** Argued that Cokeng's amended petition, which was published, mentioned his ownership of the Quezon City building. This served as sufficient notice to the public, negating the claim of concealment [9].
