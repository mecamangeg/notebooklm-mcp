I. CAPTION
BENGUET CONSOLIDATED, INC. v. BCI EMPLOYEES & WORKERS UNION-PAFLU, PHILIPPINE ASSOCIATION OF FREE LABOR UNIONS, CIPRIANO CID and JUANITO GARCIA, G.R. No. L-24711, April 30, 1968, 23 SCRA 465, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On June 23, 1959, Benguet-Balatoc Workers Union (BBWU) executed a Collective Bargaining Contract (CONTRACT) with petitioner Benguet Consolidated, Inc. (BENGUET), effective until December 23, 1963, which contained a "No-Strike, No-Lockout" clause [1]. On August 18, 1962, following a certification election, respondent BCI Employees & Workers Union (UNION) was certified as the new sole and exclusive bargaining agent, replacing BBWU [2].

On March 2, 1963, UNION went on strike regarding wage and unfair labor practice issues [3]. BENGUET incurred damages amounting to P1,911,363.83 and sued UNION, PAFLU, and their presidents for breach of contract, arguing that under the "Doctrine of Substitution," the new union was automatically bound by the No-Strike clause in the existing CONTRACT executed by BBWU [4, 5]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, ruling that the CONTRACT and its No-Strike clause did not bind the defendants [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the new collective bargaining agent (UNION) is automatically bound by the No-Strike clause in the CBA executed by the deposed union (BBWU) under the "Doctrine of Substitution."
2. W/N the defendants are liable for damages resulting from the strike.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The "Doctrine of Substitution" does not imply that a newly certified bargaining agent automatically assumes all personal undertakings of the deposed union, such as a No-Strike stipulation [7]. The doctrine merely states that employees cannot revoke a validly executed CBA by changing their bargaining agent; the contract continues to bind the *employees* up to its expiration date [8, 9]. However, the new agent (UNION) is not a party to the contract executed by the previous agent (BBWU). BBWU was the agent of the employees, not of the rival unions, and its personal commitments cannot bind a distinct entity like UNION [7]. Under Article 1704 of the Civil Code, only the labor union or members signing the contract are liable for its non-fulfillment [10]. Furthermore, under Article 1897, an agent binds the principal, but a previous agent (BBWU) cannot bind a subsequent agent (UNION) unless there is mutual agency or express assumption, which was absent here [11, 12].

2. **NO.** The defendants are not liable for damages. Since they were not parties to the CONTRACT, they cannot be liable for breach of the No-Strike clause [13]. Regarding the illegal acts committed during the strike, the rule of "vicarious liability" was expressly repealed by Republic Act No. 875 [14]. For a labor union or its officers to be liable, there must be clear proof of actual participation in, authorization of, or ratification of the illegal acts [14]. Although violence occurred, there was evidence that union leaders warned against it, and mere failure to control erring members is not sufficient to impose liability [14].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [15].
