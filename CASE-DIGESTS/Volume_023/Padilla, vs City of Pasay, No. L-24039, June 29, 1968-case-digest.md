I. CAPTION
TEODORO PADILLA v. CITY OF PASAY and HERMOGENES M. DIEGO, G.R. No. L-24039, June 29, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Teodoro Padilla was assessed P1,412.50 for 1963 real estate taxes on his property in Pasay City. Availing of the option under the Pasay City Charter (Rep. Act No. 183) to pay in two installments, he paid the first installment on time before May 31. However, he failed to pay the second installment by the October 30 deadline, paying it only on December 23, 1963 [1]. Respondent City Treasurer imposed a penalty of P169.50, calculated at 2% per month on the *entire* original tax due, reckoned from June 1 [1]. Padilla paid under protest and filed a suit for refund, arguing that delinquency should only be counted from October 31 [1]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, ruling that failure to pay the second installment on time rendered the taxpayer delinquent from June 1, the date taxes are legally due [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the delinquency penalty should be computed from June 1 on the entire tax amount even if the first installment was paid on time.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that under Section 43 of Rep. Act No. 183, all real estate taxes are "due and payable annually on the first day of June" [3]. While the law grants an option to pay in two installments (May 31 and October 30), this option must be "strictly complied with" [4]. The fact that the first installment was paid on time does not benefit the taxpayer if the second is late; the failure to pay the second installment strictly on time revives the statutory command that the tax was due on June 1 [4]. Consequently, the penalty is correctly based "on the amount of the original tax due" and computed from the original due date of June 1 [4].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Dissent (Sanchez, J., joined by Dizon, J.):** Justice Sanchez argued that delinquency means a failure to perform a duty, which only occurred after the October 30 deadline passed [6]. Therefore, the "first day of delinquency" should be October 31, and the penalty should be calculated only from that date [6, 7].
