I. CAPTION
DIRECTOR OF FORESTRY, et al. v. HON. EMMANUEL M. MUÑOZ and PINAGCAMALIGAN INDO-AGRO DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, INC. (Piadeco); PIADECO v. HON. MACARIO PERALTA, JR., et al., G.R. Nos. L-24796 & L-25459, June 28, 1968, 23 SCRA 1183, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Pinagcamaligan Indo-Agro Development Corporation (Piadeco) claimed ownership of 72,000 hectares of land in Bulacan and Rizal based on a Spanish title, *Titulo de Propiedad* No. 4136, issued in 1894. Piadeco obtained a Certificate of Private Woodland Registration (PWR No. 2065-New) from the Bureau of Forestry for a portion of the land, which was set to expire on December 31, 1964.

In April 1964, the Director of Forestry cancelled the certificate because Piadeco violated its conditions by cutting trees within the Angat and Marikina Watershed Reservations. Piadeco filed a petition (Civil Case 3035-M) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan presided by Judge Muñoz. The CFI issued a preliminary injunction against the forestry officials. In December 1964, the CFI rendered judgment declaring Piadeco the owner of the land, ruling its operations valid, and making the injunction permanent.

Piadeco's registration certificate expired on December 31, 1964, and was not renewed. Nevertheless, Piadeco continued logging. The Secretary of National Defense, upon request of forestry officials, deployed the Armed Forces (Task Force Preserve) to suppress illegal logging, resulting in the seizure of Piadeco's logs. In June 1965, Judge Muñoz ordered the execution of the December 1964 judgment and directed officials to allow Piadeco to haul its logs. The Director of Forestry filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition (L-24796) to annul these orders, while Piadeco filed a separate petition (L-25459) to enjoin the military and forestry officials from interfering with its operations.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Piadeco's Spanish title is registrable under the Revised Administrative Code.
2. W/N Piadeco can continue logging operations after the expiration of its registration certificate.
3. W/N the government seizure of Piadeco's logs was valid.
4. W/N the CFI judgment in Civil Case 3035-M can still be executed.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Forestry Administrative Order No. 12-2, which implements Section 1829 of the Revised Administrative Code, allows registration of only administrative titles (e.g., homestead patents) and judicial titles (Torrens titles). It excluded Spanish titles, which were previously registrable. This administrative regulation is valid as it is germane to the purpose of the law. Furthermore, Spanish titles are not indefeasible and can be lost by prescription. Piadeco's title was also found to be of doubtful validity due to vague boundaries and lack of proper authentication.

2. **NO.** Piadeco's registration certificate expired on December 31, 1964. Under Forestry Administrative Order No. 12-2, certificates are valid for only one year to allow for effective regulation. Without a valid registration or a forestry license, any cutting of timber is unlawful under Section 266 of the Tax Code. Possession of forest lands, however long, cannot ripen into private ownership.

3. **YES.** The logs were cut illegally because Piadeco lacked a valid license or registration at the time of seizure (or failed to prove they were cut prior to expiration). Under Bureau of Internal Revenue General Circular No. V-337, logs illegally cut from public forests are subject to seizure and forfeiture to the government, specifically to be turned over to the Armed Forces for use in constructing schoolhouses. The State's police power justifies such measures to protect natural resources and the general welfare.

4. **NO.** The judgment in Civil Case 3035-M, which enjoined the cancellation of the certificate, became *functus officio* (expired/no longer applicable) when the certificate itself expired on December 31, 1964. A judgment that has become *functus officio* can no longer be executed.

**Disposition:** The petition in L-24796 is GRANTED; the orders of Judge Muñoz are declared null and void. The petition in L-25459 is DENIED.
