I. CAPTION
**PAN PACIFIC COMPANY (PHILIPPINES) v. PHILIPPINE ADVERTISING CORPORATION and JOHN W. MEARS**, G.R. No. L-22050, June 13, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Pan Pacific Company (Philippines), through its Vice-President Wilfred Hurst, entered into an agreement with Philippine Advertising Corporation, through its President John W. Mears, for the sale and installation of Brunswick bowling alleys. The first agreement (Exhibit A) provided a "firm quotation" for 12 alleys which included installation costs but expressly excluded "freight charges for accessories that will have to be ordered from the United States." A second agreement (Exhibit D) for six additional alleys provided a "tentative quotation" subject to price adjustments [1-4]. Pan Pacific subsequently sued Philippine Advertising for the unpaid balance of the purchase price, as well as for the value of billiard tables and other equipment sold under separate invoices [5]. Philippine Advertising refused to pay, arguing that the freight, arrastre, and sales taxes sought by Pan Pacific should have been included in the quoted price, and that the alleys installed were second-hand and of inferior quality ("Liberty" type instead of "Centennial") [6]. The defendant also contested the claim for 12% interest and 25% attorney's fees stipulated in the sales invoices for the additional equipment, arguing these were signed by a mere clerk and not binding [7]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Pan Pacific, ordering Philippine Advertising to pay the balance, interest, and moral and exemplary damages [8]. Philippine Advertising appealed to the Supreme Court [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defendant is liable for freight, taxes, and other charges not explicitly included in the firm quotation.
2. W/N the defendant is bound by the stipulations for interest and attorney's fees in sales invoices signed by a mere clerk.
3. W/N the award of exemplary damages and attorney's fees is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The defendant is liable for the charges. The Court interpreted the contract provision excluding "freight charges for accessories that will have to be ordered from the United States" to cover the freight for the bowling alleys themselves. A "bowling alley" strictly refers to an installed facility; the materials shipped (beds, pinspotters, etc.) are merely parts or "accessories" until assembled [9]. Furthermore, the prices quoted in the agreements were established to be F.O.B. factory prices from the United States, meaning freight charges for goods shipped from the U.S. were for the buyer's account [10, 11].

2. **YES.** The defendant is bound by the invoice stipulations. Although the sales invoices containing the provisions for 12% interest and 25% attorney's fees were received and signed by a mere clerk, the defendant's act of accepting the equipment and accessories and making use of them constituted an implied conformity to the terms of the invoices [7, 12].

3. **YES.** The award is proper. The evidence demonstrated that the defendants acted in gross and evident bad faith, refusing to pay valid claims and raising unfounded defenses regarding the quality of the alleys (e.g., claiming they were second-hand without proof) [13, 14]. Under Article 2232 of the Civil Code, exemplary damages may be awarded if the defendant acted in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent manner. Consequently, attorney's fees were also justified under Article 2208 due to the award of exemplary damages and the defendant's gross bad faith [14].

**Decision affirmed.** [15]
