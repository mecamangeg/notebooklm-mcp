I. CAPTION
**ELISA MEDINA CUE v. PILAR DOLLA (PHILIPPINE SAVINGS BANK, Intervenor-Appellant)**, G.R. No. L-27598, May 27, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Elisa Medina Cue leased commercial premises in Quiapo, Manila to defendant Pilar Dolla on a month-to-month basis [1]. On February 14, 1966, Cue sold the property to the Philippine Savings Bank (PSB) for P700,000, covenanting to deliver the premises vacant by May 31, 1966, or else forfeit P80,000 retained by the bank [2]. When Dolla refused to vacate, Cue filed an ejectment suit in the City Court of Manila [3]. The City Court rendered judgment allowing Dolla to stay for one year provided she paid current rentals [3, 4]. Both parties appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [4].

Before trial proceeded in the CFI, PSB filed a motion to intervene, joining Cue’s prayer for ejectment but seeking P14,000 monthly compensation—reflecting the property's value—instead of the P1,500 rent [4]. The CFI denied the intervention, ruling that failure to intervene in the City Court was fatal and that intervention would create new issues not passed upon by the lower court [5]. PSB appealed the denial directly to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N intervention is proper in the Court of First Instance during an appeal from the City Court (trial *de novo*).
2. W/N the intervention changes the nature of the action or the issues.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the term "trial" in Section 2, Rule 12 of the Rules of Court, which allows intervention before or during a trial, encompasses a trial *de novo* in the CFI [6]. Under Section 9, Rule 40, a perfected appeal from an inferior court operates to vacate the lower court's judgment, and the action stands for trial *de novo* in the CFI as if it had never been tried before [6]. Because all proceedings in the inferior court are deemed inexistent in contemplation of law, intervention may be allowed before trial in the CFI [7, 8].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the intervention does not change the nature of the cause of action, which remains a suit for ejectment [8]. The intervenor's claim for increased damages or rentals is merely incidental to and flows from the main cause of action [9]. Citing *Mapua vs. Suburban Theaters, Inc.*, the Court emphasized that in ejectment, jurisdiction is determined by the nature of the action, not the amount of rentals, and a party may increase the damages prayed for in the CFI without affecting the cause of action [9, 10]. The CFI's denial of the motion was an imprudent exercise of discretion given PSB's substantial interest as the purchaser [10].

The orders of the lower court were reversed and set aside, and the CFI was directed to allow the intervention [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion concurred in the result [12].
