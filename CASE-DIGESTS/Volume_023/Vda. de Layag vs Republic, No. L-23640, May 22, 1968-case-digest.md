I. CAPTION
REMEDIOS MALUPA VDA. DE LAYAG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES (BUREAU OF PUBLIC WORKS), G.R. No. L-23640, May 22, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Alberto Layag worked as a chief cook on the tugboat M/V Chester for the Bureau of Public Works. On March 29, 1960, he died of "thrombocytopenic purpura with cerebral hemorrhage and hypoplastic anemia." His widow, Remedios, filed a claim for death benefits. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) denied the claim, ruling that the cause of death was not service-connected. In making this determination, the WCC relied on a study by its senior medical officer characterizing the disease as a blood disorder foreign to the nature of Alberto's work. Remedios appealed, arguing that the medical study was not formally offered in evidence and should be disregarded, and that the presumption of compensability under Section 43 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act should prevail.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the deceased's illness is compensable under the Workmen's Compensation Act based on the presumption of compensability.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the WCC's denial of the claim. The Commission was within its authority to rely on the medical study to determine the nature of the illness. Under Section 9 of the WCC Rules, the Commission is not bound by technical rules of legal evidence and may inform itself on technical questions to attain the objectives of the law [1]. The medical findings constituted substantial evidence that the illness was foreign to the nature of the deceased's employment. The Court held that where substantial evidence shows an illness is foreign to the nature of the work, the presumption of compensability under Section 43 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act does not operate [2].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [2].
