I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MAXIMO DIVA and CESARIA DIVA, G.R. No. L-22946, April 29, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On June 3, 1962, in San Francisco, Cebu, Ananias Bano (deceased) was attacked and killed. The prosecution alleged that spouses Maximo and Cesaria Diva, due to a previous land dispute, ambushed Bano. Witnesses claimed Maximo attacked Bano with a bolo while Cesaria struck him from behind. Maximo admitted the killing but claimed self-defense, alleging Bano attacked him first in a coconut plantation. Cesaria denied participation. After the incident, Maximo surrendered to the police in the neighboring municipality of Poro, not in San Francisco where the crime occurred.

The Court of First Instance of Cebu convicted both accused of Murder, finding evident premeditation and conspiracy, and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the killing was qualified by evident premeditation or treachery.
2. W/N Cesaria Diva is criminally liable as a conspirator.
3. W/N Maximo Diva acted in self-defense.
4. W/N the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender applies even if the accused surrendered in a different municipality.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that evident premeditation was not established. To appreciate this circumstance, the prosecution must prove: (1) the time the offender determined to commit the crime; (2) an act indicating he clung to this determination; and (3) a sufficient lapse of time to reflect. None were present here; the prior hostility occurred a year earlier. Treachery was also ruled out because, although the attack was sudden, the victim was able to retreat and defend himself before being hit.

2. **NO.** The evidence regarding Cesaria’s participation was deemed hearsay and doubtful. Prosecution witnesses who testified she struck the victim admitted arriving after the struggle began. Furthermore, Cesaria was six or seven months pregnant, making her active participation in a violent struggle between two men unlikely. Where the accused did not take part in the commission of the crime, conspiracy does not exist.

3. **NO.** Maximo failed to prove unlawful aggression, a primordial requisite for self-defense. The physical evidence (nature of wounds) and the credibility of prosecution witnesses outweighed the defense's version.

4. **YES.** The law does not require that the offender surrender to the authorities in the municipality where the offense was committed. It is sufficient that he surrenders to authorities to save the government the trouble and expense of arresting him. Maximo surrendered to the Poro police the day after the incident.

**Disposition:** The decision is **MODIFIED**. Cesaria Diva is **ACQUITTED**. Maximo Diva is found guilty of **HOMICIDE** (not Murder), with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 10 years of *prision mayor* to 12 years and 1 day of *reclusion temporal*.
