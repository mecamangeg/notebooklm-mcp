I. CAPTION
ESTANISLAO M. LEUTERIO v. COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-21800, June 22, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On May 22, 1955, a shipment of 34 bales of cotton cloth from Hong Kong arrived in Manila consigned to petitioner Estanislao M. Leuterio [1]. The importation was made on a "no-dollar" remittance basis, meaning no foreign exchange was required from banks, but the consignee failed to present a Central Bank (CB) release certificate or import license [1]. The Collector of Customs seized the shipment for violation of CB Circulars 44 and 45 [2]. The goods were released upon the posting of a bond, but on March 9, 1960—following the Supreme Court's ruling in *Pascual v. Commissioner of Customs* upholding the validity of the circulars—the Collector ordered the forfeiture of the shipment and directed Leuterio and his surety to pay its value of P19,986.53 [2]. The Commissioner of Customs and the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the forfeiture [2, 3]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that R.A. 1410 and CB Circular 133 repealed CB Circular 45, thereby extinguishing his liability [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the forfeiture of the no-dollar shipment for lack of an import license under CB Circular 45 is valid.
2. W/N R.A. 1410 or CB Circular 133 repealed CB Circular 45 so as to abate the liability.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Central Bank Circular 45, any person intending to import goods for which no foreign exchange is required must apply for a license from the Monetary Board [6]. Copious jurisprudence establishes that any no-dollar shipment without an import license violates Circular 45 and is considered merchandise imported contrary to law, subject to seizure and forfeiture [7]. The purpose of these circulars is to enable the Central Bank to monitor the volume of imports and adopt measures to remedy the financial crisis [8].

2. **NO.** R.A. 1410 does not apply because it was enacted on September 10, 1955, after the shipment had already arrived on May 22, 1955 [5]. Furthermore, Section 3 of R.A. 1410 expressly provides that goods previously imported on a no-dollar remittance basis at the time of the Act's approval are not affected by its operation [9]. Regarding CB Circular 133, it amended Circular 121 concerning foreign exchange transactions requiring the purchase of forex; since the subject importation was on a no-dollar basis, Circular 133 is irrelevant and did not repeal Circular 45 in this context [10].

The judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED [10].
