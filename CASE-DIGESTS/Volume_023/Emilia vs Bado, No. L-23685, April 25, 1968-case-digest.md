I. CAPTION
CIRILA EMILIA v. EPIFANIO BADO (Alias Paño), ET AL., G.R. No. L-23685, April 25, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On December 1, 1962, defendants Epifanio Bado, et al. allegedly entered the land of plaintiff Cirila Emilia (Lot 1131, covered by Torrens Title 0-267) in Iligan City and began constructing a house [1]. Emilia filed a complaint for injunction and damages, claiming the construction would cause irreparable injury. A preliminary injunction was issued *ex-parte* [1].

Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of cause of action, asserting through a surveyor’s sketch and affidavit that the house was being built within defendant Glicerio Bado’s own registered property (Lot 2894, covered by Torrens Title 0-275) [2]. After a summary hearing, the trial court gave credence to the surveyor's testimony that the construction was on Bado's lot. The court dissolved the preliminary injunction and dismissed the complaint, ruling that enjoining the defendants would deprive them of rights over their titled property, the title to which subsists until annulled [3]. Emilia appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N injunction is the proper remedy to recover possession of property when the defendant raises a dispute of ownership/title.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint [4]. The Court held that injunctions are not available to take property out of the possession or control of one party and place it into that of another whose title has not clearly been established [5].

The remedy of injunction is limited and cannot be availed of while rights between parties are undetermined, except in extraordinary cases of material and irreparable injury [5]. Where legal title is disputed and the possessor asserts ownership—as in this case where both parties hold Torrens titles to their respective claims—no injunction can issue to dispossess the defendant [6]. Justice and equity demand the maintenance of the *status quo* until the issue of ownership is determined by evidence [6].

Furthermore, injunction is not proper where a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy exists in law [7]. Since the core issue involves a conflict of ownership between two titleholders, the proper remedy is an *accion reivindicatoria* (suit for ownership) rather than a suit for injunction [8, 9]. The Order dismissing the complaint was affirmed [4].
