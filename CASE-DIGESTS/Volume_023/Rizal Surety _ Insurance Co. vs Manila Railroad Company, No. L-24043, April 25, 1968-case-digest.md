I. CAPTION
RIZAL SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and MANILA PORT SERVICE, G.R. No. L-24043, April 25, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On November 29, 1960, a vessel loaded with offset press machines consigned to Suter, Inc. arrived in Manila [1]. The shipment was discharged into the custody of defendant Manila Port Service (MPS) as the arrastre operator [1]. During handling, the MPS crane dropped one of the cases, heavily damaging the machine [1]. The plaintiff, Rizal Surety & Insurance Company, paid the consignee P16,680.70 representing the damage and adjuster's fees under the insurance contract [1].

Rizal Surety sued MPS and Manila Railroad Company to recover the full amount paid [2]. MPS invoked Clause 15 of the Management Contract, printed on the Delivery Permit used by the consignee, which limits liability to P500.00 per package unless the value is declared and corresponding charges are paid [3]. It was stipulated that arrastre charges were paid on a weight/measurement basis, not value [1]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Rizal Surety but limited the award to P500.00, citing the Management Contract [4]. Rizal Surety appealed, arguing that under Article 2207 of the Civil Code, it is entitled to full recovery [2, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the insurer (Rizal Surety) can recover the full amount of indemnity paid to the insured despite the limited liability clause in the arrastre management contract.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. The Court held that under **Article 2207 of the Civil Code**, an insurance company that pays indemnity for loss or injury is "subrogated to the rights of the insured against the wrong-doer or the person who has violated the contract" [4, 5].

The right of subrogation is not dependent on the amount paid by the insurer but rather on the rights of the insured. The insurer steps into the shoes of the insured and can recover only what was recoverable by the insured [5, 6]. Since the consignee (insured) was bound by the **P500.00 limited liability clause** in the Management Contract for failing to declare the true value of the goods, the insurer's right of recovery is similarly limited to P500.00 [7, 8]. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Bernabe & Co. v. Delgado Bros., Inc.* and *Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. v. Manila Port Service*, which upheld the validity of such stipulations in management contracts binding upon consignees who take delivery under them [7, 8].

Decision affirmed [9].
