I. CAPTION
FELIPE SUNGA, ET AL. v. HON. ARSENIO H. LACSON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-26055, April 29, 1968, 23 SCRA 393, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On November 11, 1958, petitioners Felipe Sunga, et al. filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction against respondents Mayor and City Engineer of Manila to stop the demolition of their houses. The court ordered the service of summons upon payment of sheriff’s fees and the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction upon the filing of a bond. However, petitioners failed to pay the fees and failed to secure approval of their bond. Consequently, no summons was served.

Despite the lack of summons, respondents appeared at the hearing for the preliminary injunction. On March 20, 1959, respondents moved to dismiss the case for failure to prosecute. Petitioners were not initially served a copy of the motion, but the court notified them that the motion would be heard on June 13, 1959. On said date, the trial court dismissed the case. Petitioners appealed, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction over the respondents due to lack of summons and that the motion to dismiss was a "useless piece of paper" for lack of notice of hearing.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the respondents despite the lack of service of summons.
2. W/N the respondents had standing to move for dismissal before filing an answer.
3. W/N the motion to dismiss was a mere "useless piece of paper" that should have been disregarded.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A defendant's voluntary appearance in an action is equivalent to the service of summons upon him (Rule 14, Sec. 23). Although no summons was served due to petitioners' failure to pay fees, respondents voluntarily submitted to the court's jurisdiction by appearing at the injunction hearing and filing a motion to dismiss.

2. **YES.** Petitioners' reliance on Rule 17, Section 1 is misplaced; that rule governs when a *plaintiff* may dismiss an action, but it does not deny a defendant the right to seek dismissal. To hold otherwise would allow a plaintiff to maintain an action in perpetuity by simply neglecting to pay sheriff's fees to prevent the service of summons.

3. **NO.** While Rule 15, Section 6 requires proof of service for a motion to be acted upon, the defect in the initial lack of notice was cured when the court reset the hearing to a later date with due notice to all parties. Unlike in *Manakil v. Revilla*, where the court acted without notice, the trial court here ensured petitioners were notified before dismissing the case.

The Order of the lower court is AFFIRMED.
