**I. CAPTION**
LEONCIA SAN ROQUE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22035, April 30, 1968, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 26, 1960, Leoncia San Roque filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Bulacan titled “In RE: Petition To Correct Name In The Birth Certificate Of Leoncia San Roque.” She alleged that while her birth certificate in the Local Civil Registry of Polo, Bulacan recorded her name as "Lucia," she had continuously used and been known by the name "Leoncia" since birth in all private and public transactions.

The Republic opposed, arguing that the petition was for the correction of an entry under Rule 108 (related to Art. 412 of the Civil Code), which contemplates only clerical errors and not substantial changes. The Republic contended that the title of the petition indicated it was for correction, not a change of name. The trial court granted the petition. The Republic appealed, claiming the court erred in applying Rule 103 (Change of Name) instead of Rule 108.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petition falls under Rule 103 (Change of Name) despite being captioned as a petition to "correct" the name in the birth certificate.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that notwithstanding the imperfection of the language employed in the title, the petition was, in essence, one to secure judicial authority to change the petitioner's name from "Lucia" to "Leoncia," which falls under **Rule 103** of the Rules of Court.

The Court relied on *Chomi v. Local Civil Registrar*, ruling that the only way to legally change a real name (which is the name in the Civil Register) is to file the special proceedings outlined in Rule 103. The body of the petition admitted her real name in the registry was "Lucia" but alleged continuous use of "Leoncia," effectively seeking a change. The prayer to "correct" the birth certificate did not necessarily make it a Rule 108 case, as **Section 6 of Rule 103** mandates that judgments changing a name be furnished to the Civil Registrar for entry in the register. Since the strict requirements of Rule 103 (including publication) were complied with, and the change did not affect civil status or citizenship, the petition was properly granted.

**Decision affirmed.**
