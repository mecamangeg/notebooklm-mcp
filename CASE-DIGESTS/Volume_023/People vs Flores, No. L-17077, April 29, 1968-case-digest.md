I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. WENCESLAO FLORES, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-17077, April 29, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of July 1, 1949, a group of armed men, including appellants Elfren Tino, Manuel Suguitan, and Rafael (Itting) Dee, broke into the house of spouses Domiciano Gatchalian and Cecilia Diaz in Aringay, La Union [1]. The intruders intimidated the residents and took money, jewelry, and other valuables [1, 2]. Cristina Dulay, a guest, claimed that one of the robbers dragged her to the kitchen and raped her at knifepoint [2].

The Court of First Instance of La Union convicted the accused of robbery in band with rape [3]. The case was elevated to the Court of Appeals, which certified it to the Supreme Court because the opinion was that the penalty should be *reclusion perpetua* [1]. Co-accused Wenceslao Flores and Florentino Picar escaped during trial, while Federico Estoesta withdrew his appeal [2, 4]. Appellants Tino, Suguitan, and Dee claimed alibi and argued they were not properly identified because witnesses failed to mention their names in the initial affidavits [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellants were positively identified despite the omission of their names in the witnesses' initial affidavits.
2. W/N the crime of rape was committed on the occasion of the robbery.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the failure of eyewitnesses to state in their affidavits that they had seen the appellants before or could recognize them does not discredit their positive testimony in court. The witnesses explained they knew the faces but not the names at the time [7, 8]. Judicial experience shows that affidavits often suffer from infirmities and omissions, especially when taken by police officers not well-versed in the law of evidence using a narration method rather than question-and-answer [7, 9]. Furthermore, the flight of co-accused Flores and Picar, and the withdrawal of appeal by Estoesta, dispelled doubts regarding the guilt of the group [10, 11].

2. **NO.** The Court found the evidence insufficient to support the charge of rape. The victim claimed she was menstruating and that the attacker lighted a match to verify this but persisted anyway [10, 12]. However, the medical examination the next day found seminal fluid without any blood mixture [10, 12]. It is improbable that a man would check for menstruation, find it, and persist, yet leave no physical trace of blood in the fluid. The testimony was uncorroborated, and the Court noted that while a woman would not normally concoct such a tale, self-inflicted indignity is not a guaranty of truth [13, 14].

**DISPOSITION:** The decision is **MODIFIED**. The appellants are convicted of **Robbery in Band** (Arts. 294, par. 5 and 295, RPC) and sentenced to 4 years and 2 months of *prision correccional* as minimum to 10 years of *prision mayor* as maximum. The indemnity for the alleged rape is eliminated [15, 16].
