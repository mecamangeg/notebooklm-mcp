I. CAPTION
CONSUELO S. CALALANG v. ENRIQUE MEDINA, Commissioner of the Public Service Commission, et al., G.R. No. L-24560, May 21, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Consuelo Calalang was granted a franchise under R.A. No. 2290 to operate an ice plant in Hagonoy, Bulacan. She filed an application for a certificate of public convenience (Case No. 126911) with the Public Service Commission (PSC). Around the same time, another operator, Aurora Tanjangco, filed for an increase in capacity (Case No. 126537). The PSC initially denied Calalang’s request for a joint hearing and subsequently denied her application. However, the Supreme Court in a related case (G.R. No. L-16068) reversed the PSC's procedural orders and directed a joint trial.

Relying on this ruling, Calalang filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of her application. The PSC failed to act on the motion for several years despite repeated requests. Consequently, on May 24, 1965, Calalang filed a petition for mandamus with the Supreme Court to compel the PSC to resolve the motion, including a claim for P100,000.00 in damages for the delay. Shortly after filing, the PSC issued an order setting aside its previous denial and scheduling the joint trial, rendering the mandamus petition moot. Calalang, however, pressed her claim for damages.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court can award the damages claimed by the petitioner despite the dismissal of the main mandamus action.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the claim for damages was merely incidental to the petition for mandamus. Since the principal action for mandamus became moot upon the PSC's compliance, the Court's jurisdiction to entertain the incidental claim for damages became debatable, as it generally lacks original jurisdiction over such claims independently. Furthermore, the Court reasoned that it was legally impossible to determine the amount of damages because there was no final judgment yet fixing the specific conditions and capacity under which the petitioner would operate her franchise.

The petition was dismissed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, and Angeles concurred. Justice Fernando took no part.
