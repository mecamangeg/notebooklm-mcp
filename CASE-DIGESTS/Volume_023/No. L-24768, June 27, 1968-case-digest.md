I. CAPTION
Gil V. Maribao and Enriqueta Llanillo-Maribao vs. The Honorable Judge Numeriano Estenzo and The City of Ormoc, G.R. No. L-24768, June 27, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On January 25, 1965, the City of Ormoc filed a complaint for expropriation (Sp. Civil Case No. 711-O) against several defendants, including petitioners Gil and Enriqueta Maribao, to use their land for a "City Government Center" [1]. Judge Numeriano Estenzo issued an order fixing the provisional value and a writ of possession on February 3, 1965, prior to the service of summons on the petitioners, which occurred on February 23, 1965 [1, 2]. The petitioners filed motions to set aside these orders and to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the court had not yet acquired jurisdiction over their persons and that the City lacked the necessary presidential or departmental approval to exercise eminent domain [2, 3]. Judge Estenzo denied these motions and appointed city officials as commissioners to ascertain compensation [2, 4]. On June 30, 1965, the trial court rendered a decision fixing the value of the properties [5]. Instead of pursuing an ordinary appeal, the petitioners filed an original action for certiorari with the Supreme Court, alleging that the respondent Judge acted without jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion [3, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the remedy of certiorari is proper to annul the proceedings of the trial court based on the alleged irregularities.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Supreme Court held that the petition for certiorari was devoid of merit and dismissed it [6, 7]. The Court reasoned that the trial court unquestionably had jurisdiction over the subject matter, the parties (who were duly served summons), and the properties involved [6]. The alleged irregularities complained of—such as the absence of presidential approval, the issuance of the writ of possession before summons, or the appointment of biased commissioners—were mere incidents in the exercise of jurisdiction and, at most, affected the City's *cause of action*, not the *jurisdiction* of the lower court [6, 8].

The Court applied the principle that errors of judgment or irregularities in the exercise of jurisdiction must be reviewed by **appeal** after the rendition of final judgment, not by a special civil action of certiorari [8]. Under Rule 65, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, certiorari may not be availed of except in the absence of an appeal or other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law [8]. Since the petitioners could have availed of an appeal from the final judgment, as their co-defendants did, certiorari was not the proper remedy [8, 9].

Petition dismissed.
