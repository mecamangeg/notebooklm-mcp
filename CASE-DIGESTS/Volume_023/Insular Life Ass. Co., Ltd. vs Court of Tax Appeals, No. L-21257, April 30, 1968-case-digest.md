I. CAPTION
THE INSULAR LIFE ASSURANCE CO., LTD. v. THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS and THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-21257, April 30, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Insular Life, a domestic life insurance company, filed its 1958 income tax return reporting 100% of dividends received from domestic corporations and paid P148,650.00 in taxes [1]. Believing it erred by not applying the 25% returnable dividend provision under Section 24(A) of the National Internal Revenue Code, petitioner filed an amended return and a claim for refund of P34,667.22 [2]. Due to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue's inaction, petitioner filed a petition with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) to avoid prescription [3]. The CTA dismissed the petition, ruling that the proviso limiting returnable dividends to 25% is found in Section 24(A) and does not apply to life insurance companies, which are governed by Section 24(B) [3, 4]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N domestic life insurance companies are entitled to return only 25% of their income from dividends under Section 24 of the Tax Code. [5]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CTA decision. Citing the recent ruling in *Filipinas Life Assurance Co. v. Court of Tax Appeals* (G.R. No. L-21258), the Court held that the 1957 amendment (Republic Act 1855) which separated the rates for life insurance companies into a new subsection (B) showed no legislative intent to withdraw the dividend exemption previously enjoyed by them [6-8]. The purpose of the amendment was to lower taxes on life insurance companies to encourage their growth [8]. The Court ruled that the placement of the dividend exclusion proviso in subsection (A) was merely a result of "haphazard amendment," and reliance on grammatical construction is unsafe when opposed to legislative intent [9]. Thus, domestic life insurance companies remain entitled to the benefits of dividend exclusion [9].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is REVERSED, and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is ordered to refund petitioner P34,667.22. [10]
