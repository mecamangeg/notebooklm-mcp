I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO CELESTIAL, MARTINA MORA, ET AL. v. JOSE L. GESTOSO and ESTRELLA TAJO, G.R. No. L-19546, April 30, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
In 1955, Spouses Celestial sold a homestead covered by OCT No. P-60 to Spouses Gestoso (Defendants) for P6,000. In 1959, the heirs of Enrique Celestial (Plaintiffs) filed an action for reconveyance to redeem the property under the Public Land Act. Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, which was denied. They then filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) on January 12, 1960. On February 11, 1960, the trial court issued two orders: one denying Plaintiffs' motion to declare Defendants in default, and another denying Defendants' MR. However, the court clerk inadvertently mailed only the order denying the default motion to Defendants' counsel, failing to include the order denying the MR due to an honest mistake believing they were the same order. Unaware that their MR had been denied, Defendants did not file an Answer. Consequently, the trial court declared them in default ex parte and rendered judgment ordering reconveyance. Upon receiving the decision, Defendants immediately filed a petition for relief from judgment, supported by the clerk's affidavit admitting the mailing error and affidavits of merit alleging valid defenses (e.g., the actual price was P7,800, not P6,000). The trial court denied the relief.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendants are entitled to relief from the judgment by default due to the mistake of the court employee.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the default orders, holding that the Defendants' failure to file an answer was due to the "inadvertence, honest mistake and excusable negligence" of the court employee who failed to mail the order denying the motion for reconsideration [1, 2]. The Defendants were laboring under the honest impression that the period to answer had not resumed running because they never received notice that their MR was denied [3]. Furthermore, the Court found the Defendants had meritorious defenses, specifically regarding the redemption price and the ownership status of the land, which should be heard [4, 5]. When parties are declared in default through no fault of their own but through the fault or negligence of a court employee, and they possess meritorious defenses, equity and justice demand that they be granted relief from judgment [1, 5].

The orders of default and the judgment by default were **SET ASIDE**, and the case was **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [6].
