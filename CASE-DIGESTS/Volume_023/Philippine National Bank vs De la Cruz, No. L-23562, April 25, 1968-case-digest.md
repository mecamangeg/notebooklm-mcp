I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. ALBERTO DE LA CRUZ, G.R. No. L-23562, April 25, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On July 14, 1954, Alberto de la Cruz (appellant) executed a real estate mortgage in favor of the Philippine National Bank (PNB) to secure a P4,000.00 loan. Due to appellant's default, PNB filed an ordinary action for collection (Civil Case No. 1094) with the Court of First Instance of Nueva Vizcaya on April 25, 1959.

Subsequently, PNB extra-judicially foreclosed the mortgage, sold the property for P200.00, and on January 7, 1960, filed an amended complaint in the civil case to recover the deficiency of P5,252.45. The appellant failed to answer the amended complaint. The trial court rendered a summary judgment ordering the appellant to pay the deficiency. Appellant appealed, arguing that PNB, having elected to file a collection suit, could not simultaneously foreclose on the property, and thus questioned the validity of the foreclosure.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the validity of the extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings may be questioned in an appeal from the decision granting the deficiency claim.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the questions raised in the appeal regarding the validity of the foreclosure are "totally immaterial and irrelevant" to the action to recover the unpaid balance of the credit. The Court ruled that if the appellant desired to annul the extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings, his remedy was clearly not an appeal from the decision of the trial court sustaining the appellee's right to collect the unpaid balance of the loan.

The appealed judgment is affirmed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
