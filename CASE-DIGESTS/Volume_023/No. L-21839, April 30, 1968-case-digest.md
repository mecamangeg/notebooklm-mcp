**I. CAPTION**
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. UNITED STATES LINES CO. and THE MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-21839, April 30, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiff Insurance Company of North America, as subrogee, paid the consignee $1,228.48 for a shipment of cases that were partly lost and damaged [1]. The shipment had been discharged by the carrier, United States Lines Co., to the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service (a subsidiary of Manila Railroad Company) [2, 3]. Uncertain whether the loss occurred during transit or after discharge, the plaintiff filed an alternative complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against both the carrier (an admiralty action) and the arrastre operator (for performance of arrastre contract) [4].

The CFI found that the goods were fully discharged in good order to the Manila Port Service, making the arrastre operator solely responsible [5, 6]. However, the CFI dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. It reasoned that since the admiralty aspect against the carrier (which justified CFI jurisdiction) was effectively dropped upon finding the carrier not liable, the remaining claim against the arrastre operator was below the P5,000 jurisdictional amount and fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Municipal Court [7, 8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance retains jurisdiction over an alternative cause of action for an amount below its jurisdictional limit after the admiralty case against the co-defendant is dismissed.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's dismissal. The Court held that under Section 5, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court, the joinder of alternative causes of action is allowed when the plaintiff is unsure at what stage of the transaction the loss occurred [9, 10]. Since the action against the carrier was one in admiralty—a matter cognizable by the CFI—the suit was correctly filed in said court, even if the alternative claim against the arrastre operator was for an amount ordinarily within the Municipal Court's jurisdiction [11].

The Court applied the doctrine that "jurisdiction once acquired is not lost but continues until the case is finally terminated" [12, 13]. Consequently, the subsequent dismissal of the admiralty case against the carrier did not divest the CFI of the jurisdiction it had validly acquired at the time the complaint was filed [13, 14].

**Petition GRANTED.** The decision was reversed, and defendants Manila Port Service and/or Manila Railroad Co. were ordered to pay the plaintiff the sum of $1,266.13 or its peso equivalent [13, 15].
