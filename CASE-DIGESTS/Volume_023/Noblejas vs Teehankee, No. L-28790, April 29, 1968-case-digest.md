I. CAPTION
ANTONIO H. NOBLEJAS, as Commissioner of Land Registration v. CLAUDIO TEEHANKEE, as Secretary of Justice, and RAFAEL M. SALAS, as Executive Secretary, G.R. No. L-28790, April 29, 1968, 23 SCRA 405, Reyes, J.B.L., Actg. C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Antonio H. Noblejas was the Commissioner of Land Registration, a position created by Republic Act No. 1151. Section 2 of said Act entitled him to the "same compensation, emoluments and privileges as those of a Judge of the Court of First Instance." On March 7, 1968, Respondent Secretary of Justice Claudio Teehankee required Noblejas to explain why no disciplinary action should be taken against him for approving subdivision plans covering areas in excess of original titles [1, 2].

Noblejas argued that because he held the rank and privileges of a Judge of the Court of First Instance (CFI), he could only be suspended and investigated by the Supreme Court pursuant to Section 67 of the Judiciary Act (R.A. No. 296) and Rule 140 of the Rules of Court. Subsequently, Respondent Executive Secretary Rafael Salas suspended Noblejas pending investigation for gross negligence and conduct prejudicial to the public interest. Noblejas filed a petition for prohibition with the Supreme Court to restrain the investigation and declare his suspension inoperative, claiming lack of jurisdiction on the part of the respondents [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Commissioner of Land Registration may only be investigated and suspended by the Supreme Court by virtue of the grant of "rank and privileges of a Judge of the Court of First Instance" under R.A. No. 1151.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the grant of "privileges" of a CFI Judge to the Commissioner of Land Registration does not include the right to be investigated only by the Supreme Court [4].

First, Section 67 of the Judiciary Act applies specifically to "District Judges," and the Petitioner is not a District Judge nor a member of the Judiciary [4]. Second, adopting Petitioner's theory would violate the fundamental doctrine of **separation of powers**. If the statute were interpreted to charge the Supreme Court with the administrative function of disciplining executive officials, it would be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court cannot be required to exercise power or perform duties not pertaining to the administration of judicial functions [5, 6]. It would also unconstitutionally reduce the President's power of control and supervision over executive appointees [7].

Applying the principle of **statutory construction** that statutes should be interpreted to avoid conflict with the Constitution, the Court held that the "privileges" granted by R.A. No. 1151 did not intend to include the removal process reserved for the Judiciary [8]. Furthermore, the Petitioner's function of resolving *consultas* is minimal and incidental, and does not convert his executive office into a judicial one [9, 10].

Accordingly, the writs were denied and the petition was **DISMISSED** [11].
