I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RAMONA RUIZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23712, April 29, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., Actg. C.J.

II. FACTS
Cayetano Pinto was granted a homestead patent and an Original Certificate of Title (OCT) in 1933. On May 28, 1937, within the five-year prohibitory period, he sold a three-hectare portion of the homestead to Jacobo Pinto. Cayetano died in 1945, and his widow, Ramona Ruiz, and their children executed an extrajudicial partition, securing a Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) in their names.

After a separate civil case declared the 1937 sale void *ab initio* for violating the Public Land Act, the Republic filed an action for the reversion of the entire homestead to the State. The Court of First Instance ordered the cancellation of the heirs' title and the reversion of the land. The heirs appealed, arguing that since the sale was void and "inexistent," no violation was committed, and that the reversion should not prejudice the heirs or the indefeasibility of their Torrens title.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the sale of a portion of the homestead within the prohibited period warrants the reversion of the entire grant to the State.
2. W/N the heirs of the homesteader are bound by the violation committed by their predecessor.
3. W/N the registered Torrens title bars the State’s action for reversion.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 118 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 (Public Land Act) expressly forbids the alienation of a homestead within five years from the issuance of the patent. Under Section 124, such violation produces the effect of annulling the grant and causing the reversion of the property to the State. The Court rejected the argument that a void contract is "non-existent" and thus constitutes no violation; it is the transgression of the law that renders the deed void, not vice-versa. Furthermore, the alienation of a part of the homestead violates the condition of the grant, justifying the reversion of the *whole* area (*Republic v. Garcia*).

2. **YES.** The widow is bound by the sale executed by her husband as the administrator of the conjugal partnership. The children are also bound because there is a privity of interest between them and their father; they only succeed to whatever rights their father had (*Galasinao v. Austria*). The hardship suffered by the family is part of the penalty's built-in deterrence.

3. **NO.** The principle of indefeasibility of a Torrens title cannot defeat the express policy of the State prohibiting alienation within five years. Where a grantee violates Section 118, the court may properly order reconveyance to the grantor even if the property is under the Torrens System (*Campanero v. Coloma*). Additionally, the Statute of Limitations does not run against the State.

Decision affirmed. Defendants-appellants are ordered to reconvey the land to the plaintiff-appellee.
