I. CAPTION
CITIZENS’ SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY, INC. v. SOLOMON LORENZANA and ANITA U. LORENZANA, et al., G.R. No. L-20800, April 29, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On March 22, 1958, petitioner Citizens' Surety issued a surety bond for P28,000.00 in behalf of respondent Anita Lorenzana in favor of the Bureau of Lands to secure her rental indebtedness. In connection with this, Anita and respondent spouses Leopoldo and Aurora Gonzales executed an indemnity agreement, binding themselves jointly and severally to pay premiums and authorizing the Surety to execute renewals.

On February 24, 1959, Leopoldo Gonzales requested a renewal. The Surety issued a renewal endorsement for the period of March 22, 1959, to March 22, 1960, and sent it to Anita with a demand for the P781.58 premium. Anita received it on April 30, 1959, but kept silent and did not file the renewal with the Bureau of Lands. Instead, on October 5, 1959, she filed a bond from a different company (Manila Surety & Fidelity Co.).

When the Surety sued for the premium, the Municipal Court of Manila held the respondents liable. However, the Court of First Instance (CFI) reversed this on appeal, ruling that there was no perfected contract of suretyship because the bond was never approved by the Bureau of Lands, and thus the Surety assumed no risk.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondents are liable for the premium on the renewed bond despite their failure to file it with the obligee (Bureau of Lands).

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CFI decision. The Court held that the CFI oversimplified the problem by ignoring the existing contract and indemnity agreement which specifically provided for renewal [1, 2]. The renewal was explicitly requested by Leopoldo Gonzales, a solidary co-indemnitor, and the Surety complied by sending the endorsement to Anita [3].

Upon receipt of the renewal, it was Anita’s duty to file it with the Bureau of Lands. She cannot disclaim responsibility for the premium based on her own desistance, as to do so would practically leave compliance with the contract to the will of one of the parties [4]. While she could have refused or cancelled the bond, such refusal presupposes an overt act brought to the knowledge of the Surety so it could protect its interests [4]. Since the Surety considered the bond in force and carried it as a contingent liability, reducing its capacity to do business, justice dictates that respondents must pay [4].

The judgment appealed from is **REVERSED**, and respondents are ordered to pay jointly and severally the sum of P781.58 with legal interest, plus P200.00 attorney's fees [5].
