I. CAPTION
MAJOR VITALIANO B. VALDEZ v. HON. LUCIO G. GUTIERREZ and THE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL OF MALABON, RIZAL, G.R. No. L-25819, May 22, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Valdez, a non-eligible World War veteran, was appointed as Chief of Police of Malabon by Respondent Mayor Gutierrez on March 12, 1962. The appointment was provisional, to continue until an eligible was secured [1]. On June 13, 1962, Valdez was suspended after being charged with murder [2]. Three months later, the Mayor appointed Pedro P. Cruz, Jr. as Chief of Police "vice Vitaliano B. Valdez... whose services were terminated" [2]. Cruz subsequently qualified as a civil service eligible [3].

On May 25, 1965, Valdez was acquitted of the murder charge [3]. He demanded reinstatement and back salaries pursuant to Section 4 of Republic Act No. 557, which provides for reinstatement upon acquittal [3]. The request was denied because his appointment was provisional. Valdez filed a petition for *mandamus*, but the Court of First Instance dismissed it, ruling he had no valid cause of action [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a non-eligible appointee whose provisional appointment was terminated is entitled to reinstatement and back salaries under R.A. No. 557 following his acquittal in a criminal case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that *mandamus* requires a showing of a clear and certain right, which Petitioner failed to establish [5].

First, Petitioner's appointment was temporary because he was not a civil service eligible [6]. As such, he could not be permanently appointed to a classified position, and the appointing power could validly terminate his services upon the appointment of a qualified successor [6].

Second, the Court ruled that the protection under Section 4 of R.A. No. 557 can only be invoked by civil service eligibles (*Cayabyab v. Cayabyab*) [7]. Since Petitioner was a non-eligible, he cannot claim the benefit of reinstatement and back salaries guaranteed by the Act [8]. The doctrine in *People v. Bautista*, which grants reinstatement upon acquittal, applies only to members of the police force who are eligibles [8].

Petition denied. Decision affirmed [9].
