I. CAPTION
FEDERICO CAÑETE and PEDRO RUDAS v. HON. JUDGE, COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF ZAMBOANGA DEL SUR and GANLAY AMBAN, G.R. No. L-21743, May 4, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Ganlay Amban filed a case for possession and damages against petitioners Cañete and Rudas regarding a land in Zamboanga del Sur. Cañete claimed he purchased the land from Amban in 1953. On the scheduled hearing of October 18, 1962, petitioners and their counsel failed to appear [1]. The trial court allowed Amban to present evidence *ex parte* and rendered a decision on November 23, 1962, declaring Cañete's alleged deed of sale void for fraud and lack of approval by the Provincial Governor, as Amban was an unlettered non-Christian Subano [2]. Petitioners received the decision on December 10, 1962 [3].

Petitioners had filed an unverified motion on November 27, 1962, to reconsider the default order, citing counsel’s medical emergency, but this was denied on February 15, 1963 [4]. After the court granted execution on March 22, 1963, petitioners filed a petition for relief from judgment on April 22, 1963 [5]. The lower court denied the petition, prompting this certiorari action [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court abused its discretion in denying the postponement and proceeding *ex parte*.
2. W/N the petition for relief from judgment was filed within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A motion for postponement is a privilege, not a right. The Court held that a movant should not rely on the liberality of the court nor the generosity of the adverse party [7]. Counsel received notice of the hearing on September 25, 1962, yet failed to file a motion until the last hour or notify the adverse party, demonstrating negligence [8, 9]. The court acted in line with the policy of expediting cases to forestall clogging of dockets [10].

2. **NO.** The petition for relief was filed out of time. The Court reiterated the doctrine that the 60-day period set forth in Rule 38 is absolutely fixed, inextendible, never interrupted, and cannot be subjected to any condition or contingency [7, 11]. Petitioners received the judgment on December 10, 1962, but filed for relief only on April 22, 1963, well beyond the 60-day limit [11]. Furthermore, the petition was fatally defective as it was unverified and lacked an affidavit of merits as required by Section 3, Rule 38 [12].

Petition denied [13].
