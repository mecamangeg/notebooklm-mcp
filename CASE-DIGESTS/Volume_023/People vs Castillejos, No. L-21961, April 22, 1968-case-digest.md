I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MANUEL CASTILLEJOS Y RELANO and CONSOLACION INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-21961, April 22, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Consolacion Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. posted a P6,000.00 bond for the provisional liberty of Manuel Castillejos, who was charged with robbery but convicted only of slight physical injuries. Castillejos failed to appear for the promulgation of judgment on August 16, 1963 [1]. Consequently, the trial court ordered the confiscation of the bond and gave the bondsman 30 days to show cause why judgment should not be rendered against it [1].

On September 16, 1963, within the 30-day period, the bondsman filed a second motion for reconsideration, explaining that the accused's non-appearance was due to his confinement at the Rizal Provincial Hospital and that the accused had subsequently surrendered to serve his sentence [2]. On the same day, the trial court denied the motion and rendered judgment against the bondsman for the full amount of the bond [3]. The bondsman appealed, arguing the court abused its discretion by rendering judgment before the 30-day period expired [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court may render judgment on the bond before the expiration of the 30-day period granted to the bondsman.
2. W/N the bondsman’s liability should be reduced despite the belated explanation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that there is no need for the lower court to wait for the expiration of the 30-day period before rendering judgment on the bond if the principal is produced (or a reason is given for non-production) and an explanation for non-appearance is submitted [4, 5]. Citing *People v. Del Carmen*, the Court ruled that once the bondsman has performed these acts, the matter is submitted for resolution solely on the question of whether the explanation is satisfactory [4].

2. **YES.** While the Court found the explanation for non-appearance not entirely satisfactory because it was belated, it considered the undisputed fact that the accused was actually hospitalized on the required date [6, 7]. Furthermore, considering the accused was convicted only of slight physical injuries (a 20-day sentence) rather than the graver offense of robbery for which the bond was posted, the Court exercised its discretion to reduce the liability [7].

The Order appealed from is **MODIFIED**, and the bondsman's liability is reduced to the nominal sum of P200.00 [7].
