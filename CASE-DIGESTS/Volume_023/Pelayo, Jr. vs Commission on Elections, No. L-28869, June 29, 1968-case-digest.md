I. CAPTION
PANTALEON V. PELAYO, JR. v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, GAUDIOSO M. TIONGCO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-28869, June 29, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
In the November 14, 1967 elections in Davao City, petitioner Pantaleon Pelayo, Jr. (Liberal Party) and respondent Gaudioso Tiongco (Nacionalista Party) contested the 10th councilor seat. The original City Board of Canvassers ("old board"), chaired by City Judge Vicente Calanog (who substituted Acting City Fiscal Raul Pichon), canvassed the votes [1-3]. On December 26, 1967, the old board proclaimed the Mayor, Vice-Mayor, and nine councilors but suspended the proclamation of the 10th councilor due to a restraining order from the Court of First Instance of Davao in Election Case 1571 filed by Tiongco [4]. After the court lifted the order, the old board proclaimed Pelayo as the 10th councilor on January 13, 1968 [3].

Tiongco petitioned the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to annul the proclamation, arguing that: (1) the substitution of Acting City Fiscal Pichon by Judge Calanog was illegal; and (2) the old board was *functus officio* because the newly elected city officials had already assumed office, and thus should constitute the "new board" to canvass the remaining votes [5]. On February 7, 1968, COMELEC annulled Pelayo's proclamation, ruled the old board illegally constituted, and created a new board composed of the newly elected officials with Fiscal Pichon as Chairman [6]. Pelayo filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the substitution of the Acting City Fiscal by a City Judge as Chairman of the Board of Canvassers was valid.
2. W/N the old Board of Canvassers became *functus officio* after the term of office of the newly elected officials began.
3. W/N the newly elected city officials are disqualified from sitting as members of the Board of Canvassers to proclaim the remaining winner in the same election.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The substitution was proper. The Supreme Court held that COMELEC has broad latitude and power to adopt means to insure free, orderly, and honest elections [8]. It is COMELEC policy not to allow appointees of the Executive in an "acting" capacity (like Fiscal Pichon) to sit on the board to prevent partiality and the easing out of undesirable officials [9, 10]. Unlike in *Campos v. Comelec*, Fiscal Pichon was not automatically entitled to the seat by rank, as he was only the Fourth Assistant City Fiscal, and thus COMELEC had no alternative but to effect a substitution [8, 11].

2. **NO.** The old board did not lose its authority. The Board of Canvassers is a specific body created for canvass and proclamation, distinct from the City Council, and its term does not coincide with the term of the officials concerned [12, 13]. It retains authority until it has totally discharged its duties and adjourned *sine die*, only then becoming *functus officio* [12, 13]. The proclamation was merely suspended by a court order, and justice dictates the board be allowed to finish its task [14].

3. **YES.** The newly elected officials are disqualified. Section 28 of the Revised Election Code renders a candidate incompetent to act as a member of the board of canvassers [15, 16]. The Court ruled that if a mere candidate is disqualified, one who has been elected in that same election stands on no higher level [15, 16]. Allowing the new board (composed mostly of political allies and opponents) to sit would result in prejudice to the remaining unproclaimed candidate [17]. Consequently, the "new board" created by COMELEC is disqualified to act.

**Petition granted; resolutions set aside and declared null and void.** [18]
