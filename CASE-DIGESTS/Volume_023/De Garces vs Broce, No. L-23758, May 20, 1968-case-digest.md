I. CAPTION
MAXIMINA OYOD DE GARCES, ET AL. v. ESMERALDA BROCE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23758, May 20, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Severo Oyod and Bonifacia Mahinay were the original owners of Lot No. 228. In 1930, their heirs executed a notarized but unregistered Deed of Extra-Judicial Partition, allocating specific portions of the property to themselves. One heir, Eugenia, died in 1950. In 1951, the remaining heirs executed a registered Deed of Extra-Judicial Settlement, agreeing to hold the properties *pro-indiviso*.

In 1962, the heirs of Fortunata Oyod (one of the original heirs) sold Lot No. 228-D—the specific portion assigned to Fortunata in the 1930 partition—to Esmeralda Broce. Plaintiffs-appellants (other heirs) filed an action to annul the sale, arguing that the 1951 registered settlement prevailed, meaning the land was co-owned and Fortunata's heirs could not sell a specific portion. The trial court upheld the 1930 partition and the sale but ordered Broce to pay a share of the estate's tax obligation. Both parties appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 1930 unregistered extrajudicial partition is valid and binding among the heirs, effectively cancelling the subsequent 1951 registered settlement.
2. W/N the buyer, Esmeralda Broce, is liable for the estate's tax obligations.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the 1930 unregistered partition is valid and binding among the heirs. Section 1 of Rule 74 of the Rules of Court, which requires a public instrument and registration for partitions, is merely evidentiary and not constitutive of the contract [1]. Its purpose is to protect creditors and provide constructive notice to third parties [2]. Citing *Hernandez v. Andal* (78 Phil. 196), the Court held that where no creditors are involved, it is competent for heirs to enter into a distribution agreement different from that provided by law [2]. The 1930 voluntary division conferred exclusive ownership of the assigned portions to the heirs [3]. Consequently, the 1951 agreement could not substitute or cancel the 1930 partition, particularly because one of the original co-signers (Eugenia) had died prior to the 1951 execution [3]. Thus, the sale of the specific Lot 228-D to Broce was valid.

2. **NO.** Broce is a mere vendee of Lot 228-D and not an heir. She cannot be required to share in the payment of an obligation contracted by the heirs of the estate [4].

The decision of the lower court is **MODIFIED**; the sale is affirmed, but Broce is absolved from the monetary liability [4].
