I. CAPTION
CALTEX FILIPINO MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS ASSOCIATION v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and CALTEX (PHILIPPINES), INC., G.R. No. L-28472, April 30, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., Actg. C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner CAFIMSA instituted unfair labor practice (ULP) charges against respondent Caltex, leading the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) Prosecution Division to file a complaint (Case No. 4344-ULP) after a preliminary investigation [1, 2]. While the case was pending, CAFIMSA declared a strike on April 22, 1965, which ended with a Return to Work Agreement on May 30, 1965 [3, 4]. On November 27, 1967, CAFIMSA filed a "Motion to Admit Supplemental Pleading," seeking to include new ULP charges allegedly committed by Caltex after the strike and the return-to-work agreement [5, 6]. Caltex objected, arguing the new matters required a separate preliminary investigation [5]. The CIR denied the motion, ruling it lacked jurisdiction over the new matters because they had not undergone the mandatory preliminary investigation [6]. After the CIR *en banc* denied its motion for reconsideration, CAFIMSA filed a petition for mandamus with the Supreme Court to compel the admission of the pleading [7-9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR may be compelled by mandamus to admit a supplemental pleading charging additional acts of unfair labor practice without a prior preliminary investigation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that a supplemental pleading which charges *additional* acts of unfair labor practice cannot be admitted by the CIR without conducting another preliminary investigation relative thereto [10, 11]. Under Republic Act No. 875, a preliminary investigation is a mandatory requirement before the CIR can take cognizance of ULP charges, intended to protect respondents from frivolous suits and prevent the dissipation of the court's time [12, 13]. To allow the supplemental pleading would circumvent this mandatory procedure [14]. Furthermore, mandamus will not lie to compel the performance of a discretionary act, and the admission of a supplemental pleading lies within the sound discretion of the court [15-17]. Finally, mandamus is improper because CAFIMSA had an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law: it could file a separate charge for the new acts before the Prosecution Division [16, 18].

Petition denied [18].
