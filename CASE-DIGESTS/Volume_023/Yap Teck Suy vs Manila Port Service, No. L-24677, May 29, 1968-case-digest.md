I. CAPTION
YAP TECK SUY v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-24677, May 29, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Yap Teck Suy was the consignee of a shipment of automobile main leaf springs discharged from the vessel "S.S. Ninny Figari" into the custody of the arrastre operator, defendant Manila Port Service. A portion of the shipment (594 pieces) was lost. Plaintiff filed a provisional claim for the loss within the 15-day period required under Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract. However, this provisional claim did not state the exact value of the missing merchandise and was not supported by documents.

The City Court of Manila ruled in favor of the plaintiff. On appeal, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, based on a stipulation of facts, also held the defendants liable, ordering them to pay P1,550.98 in damages and P300.00 in attorney's fees [1], [2]. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the provisional claim was insufficient because it failed to specify the value of the short-landed items, arguing it was merely a "notice of anticipated loss" rather than a "claim for value" as required by the Management Contract [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a provisional claim that fails to state the exact value of the missing merchandise constitutes substantial compliance with the requirement of filing a claim within 15 days under the Management Contract.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, rejecting the appellants' contention [3], [4].

The Court held that the presentation of a provisional claim within the required 15-day period constitutes substantial compliance with Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract, even if the claim does not state the exact value of the missing or damaged merchandise or is not supported by proper documents [5], [3]. The purpose of the requirement is to afford the arrastre operator a reasonable opportunity to check the validity of the demand while the facts are still fresh in the minds of those involved and pertinent papers are available [6], [3].

For the purpose of placing the arrastre operator "upon inquiry," the specific value of the merchandise is unessential [5], [3]. In this case, the timely provisional claim did not prevent the appellants from verifying the truthfulness of the plaintiff's allegations of loss [3].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed [4].
