I. CAPTION
FIDELINO C. AGAWIN v. QUINTIN CABRERA and HON. ARSENIO NAÑAWA, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Laguna, Branch IV, G.R. No. L-23885, April 25, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Agawin and respondent Cabrera were candidates for Mayor of Pagsanjan, Laguna in the November 12, 1963 elections [1]. Cabrera was proclaimed the winner, prompting Agawin to file an election protest alleging fraud and illegal practices [1]. Cabrera moved to dismiss the protest, arguing that Agawin filed his certificate of candidacy with the Commission on Elections instead of the municipal secretary as required by the Revised Election Code, constituting a jurisdictional defect [2]. On July 11, 1964, the respondent Judge dismissed the protest on this ground [3]. Agawin filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court alleging grave abuse of discretion [3]. During the pendency of the case, the term of office (1964-1967) expired, and a new election was held in November 1967 where the parties faced each other again [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition should be dismissed for being moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that since the contested term of office (1964–1967) had already expired, any decision regarding the protest and counter-protest could no longer be given any practical effect [4]. Citing *Gonzaga v. Bico* and *Tuanda v. Dionaldo*, the expiration of the term renders the case academic [4].

Accordingly, the petition is dismissed [4].
