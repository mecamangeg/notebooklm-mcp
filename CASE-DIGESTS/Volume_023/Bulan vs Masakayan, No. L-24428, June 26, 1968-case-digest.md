I. CAPTION
PETRONILA BULAN and ROBERTO GARCIA v. THE HONORABLE JUDGE HONORATO B. MASAKAYAN, GONZALO I. GUEVARA and RAMON V. PURUGGANAN, G.R. No. L-24428, June 26, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On December 29, 1964, Spouses Apolonio Laconza and Felicitas Ordoñez sold Lot No. 4213-A to petitioners Petronila Bulan and Roberto Garcia [1]. The sale was registered on January 4, 1965 [1]. However, prior to the sale, on December 3, 1964, respondent Gonzalo I. Guevara had registered an adverse claim on the same title against the previous owners (Spouses Laconza and Ordoñez) [1].

Petitioners filed a petition for cancellation of the adverse claim under Section 110 of the Land Registration Act (Act 496), arguing the claim was defective [2]. The adverse claimant opposed, and the trial court judge, Hon. Masakayan, dismissed the petition [3]. Instead of appealing, petitioners filed a special civil action for *certiorari* and *mandamus* with the Supreme Court, seeking to set aside the dismissal and compel the judge to determine the validity of the claim [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the previous owners are indispensable parties in the action to cancel the adverse claim.
2. W/N *certiorari* and *mandamus* are the proper remedies to question the order of dismissal.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the adverse claim was specifically directed against the previous owners of Lot No. 4213-A, not the petitioners [4]. Since the petitioners bought the land subject to this claim, determining its validity requires ascertaining whether the previous owners intended the lot as collateral for the loan advanced by the claimant [4]. Thus, the previous owners are indispensable parties who must be included in the case [4].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the lower court did not act without jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the petition, nor did it unlawfully neglect a specific duty [5]. If the dismissal was an error of judgment, the proper remedy was an ordinary appeal, not *certiorari* or *mandamus* [5].

The petition is DENIED [6].
