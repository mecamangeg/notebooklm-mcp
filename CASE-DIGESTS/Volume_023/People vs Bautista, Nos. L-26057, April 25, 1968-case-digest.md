I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES and QUINCIANO DE VERA v. HON. PEDRO JL. BAUTISTA and ROSITA FLORES DABU, G.R. Nos. L-26057 and L-26092, April 25, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Two informations were filed against respondent Rosita Flores Dabu for falsification of public documents (Criminal Cases Nos. 6708-P and 6709-P) [1]. She was accused of executing birth certificates for Susan Dabu de Vera and Quinciano Dabu de Vera, Jr., falsely stating she was married to petitioner Quinciano de Vera and that the children were legitimate [2], [3]. Before trial, the prosecution moved to amend the informations to correct clerical details: (1) changing the date of filing in the Civil Registry from March 20 to March 29, 1961, and the Entry Number from 907 to 807; (2) changing a child's birth date from September 13 to September 12, 1962; and (3) correcting the description of a birth certificate in the list of witnesses/exhibits [4], [5]. Respondent Judge Bautista denied the motion, accepting the accused's objection that the amendments were prejudicial [5]. The prosecution filed a petition for certiorari [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the proposed amendments to the informations are merely formal and should be allowed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the amendments are merely formal and do not impair the rights of the accused [6].

First, regarding the date of filing and entry numbers in the Civil Registry, the Court held that these are not elements of the crime of falsification by false narration of facts, as the offense was already completed before the documents were filed [6]. The purpose of the amendment was merely to correct clerical mistakes in unessential details [6].

Second, regarding the change in the child's birth date by one day, the Court found this immaterial and irrelevant to the offense charged [7]. The core of the falsification charge was the untrue statement regarding the parents' marriage and the child's legitimacy, which is unaffected by a one-day difference in the birth date [7], [8].

Third, regarding the list of exhibits, the Court stated that the prosecution is not duty-bound to apprise the accused of all evidence it intends to produce under Revised Rule 116, Section 1 [8]. Amending the list at the foot of the information does not alter the body of the information itself [8].

The trial judge's refusal to allow these formal amendments constituted grave abuse of discretion [9]. The petition was GRANTED, the orders were annulled, and the lower court was directed to permit the amendments [9].
