I. CAPTION
NATIONAL MARKETING CORPORATION (NAMARCO), JOVENAL D. ALMENDRAS and SERAPIO J. DATOC v. HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL and GERMAN E. VILLANUEVA, G.R. No. L-27260, April 29, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent German E. Villanueva (trading as VILTRA) filed a petition for *mandamus* with preliminary injunction against NAMARCO in the Court of First Instance of Manila, presided by Respondent Judge Cloribel [1]. VILTRA sought to enforce a November 24, 1965 contract whereby VILTRA would open a domestic letter of credit and NAMARCO would open a foreign letter of credit to import wire rods [2]. NAMARCO allegedly refused to comply. Judge Cloribel issued a preliminary mandatory injunction ordering NAMARCO to open the letter of credit [3].

Subsequently, VILTRA filed an amended complaint completely changing the nature of the action from *mandamus* (a special civil action) to *specific performance* with damages (an ordinary civil action) [4]. Despite NAMARCO’s opposition, the Judge admitted the amendment. VILTRA then moved for summary judgment, claiming no genuine issues of fact existed. Judge Cloribel granted the motion, struck out NAMARCO's answer, and rendered a "Partial Decision" ordering NAMARCO to comply with the contract [5]. The Judge also issued writs of execution pending appeal [6, 7]. NAMARCO filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition to annul these orders.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in admitting the amended complaint and rendering the summary partial decision.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the proceedings were irregular and void.

The Court held that the original action for *mandamus* "had no leg to stand on" because the writ cannot be used to enforce alleged contractual obligations under a disputed contract—specifically one disputed on grounds of failure of perfection, illegality, and being against public policy [8, 9]. The amendment converting the suit from *mandamus* to *specific performance* was clearly intended to cure the error of the initial filing [10].

Furthermore, the rendition of the summary "Partial Decision" was irregular. NAMARCO's answers to both the original and amended complaints duly raised the defenses of illegality and unenforceability of the contract [11]. Since these were genuine issues, it was improvident for the judge to issue a mandatory injunction or render a summary judgment requiring compliance. Consequently, the writs of execution issued by the respondent judge were likewise void [11].

The writs of certiorari and prohibition are **GRANTED**, and the preliminary injunction is made permanent [12].
