I. CAPTION
LA FUERZA, INC. v. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS and ASSOCIATED ENGINEERING CO., INC., G.R. No. L-24069, June 28, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Associated Engineering Co., Inc. (Associated) contracted to manufacture and install a flat belt conveyor system for the wine factory of La Fuerza, Inc. (La Fuerza) for P13,250 [1, 2]. La Fuerza paid a downpayment of P5,000 [1]. Installation was completed in May 1960, with trial runs conducted until July 1960 [3]. La Fuerza claimed the system was defective, causing bottles to break and slowing down production, and refused to pay the balance [4, 5].

On March 22, 1961, Associated sued for collection of the P8,250 balance [6]. On April 17, 1961, La Fuerza filed its answer seeking rescission of the contract and a refund of the downpayment due to breach of warranty [6, 7]. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of La Fuerza, rescinding the contract [8]. The Court of Appeals (CA) initially affirmed but later reversed its decision, ruling that La Fuerza’s action for rescission was barred by prescription under Article 1571 of the Civil Code, having been filed more than six months after delivery [7]. La Fuerza appealed, arguing there was no "delivery" without its acceptance [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N La Fuerza’s action for rescission based on hidden defects is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's resolution. Under Article 1714 of the Civil Code, the provisions on warranty against hidden defects in sales apply to contracts for a piece of work [10, 11]. Consequently, Article 1571 applies, which mandates that actions to rescind must be brought within six months from the delivery of the thing sold [10, 11].

The Court rejected La Fuerza's argument that acceptance is required for delivery to be complete. Delivery and acceptance are distinct acts: delivery is the obligation of the vendor to place the thing in the control and possession of the vendee (Arts. 1495, 1497), while acceptance is the obligation of the vendee (Art. 1582) [11, 12]. Since the conveyors were installed and in La Fuerza's possession by May 1960 (with final trial runs in July 1960), the six-month prescriptive period began to run then [13]. La Fuerza only claimed rescission in April 1961, ten months later, which is beyond the statutory period [7, 14]. The general four-year prescriptive period for rescission (Art. 1389) does not apply as it must yield to the specific provision governing hidden defects [15].

Resolution affirmed [16].
