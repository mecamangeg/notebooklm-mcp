I. CAPTION
RAMON P. FERNANDEZ v. EDUARDO ROMUALDEZ, ABELARDO SUBIDO, JACINTO GAVINO, ALFREDO DE LA FUENTE, and JOB P. GUINTO, G.R. No. L-26208, April 3, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On June 5, 1962, petitioner Fernandez was appointed Collector of Customs of the Port of Jose Panganiban [1]. The appointment was "Probationary" and good for only six months from his assumption of duty on June 18, 1962 [1, 2]. After this period expired, the Acting Secretary of Finance extended another appointment on January 10, 1963, effective December 19, 1962 [3]. This subsequent appointment was expressly stated to be "temporary in nature" [3]. Fernandez continued occupying the position under this status until April 19, 1966, when he was formally notified that his appointment was terminated [4]. Respondent De la Fuente was designated as Acting Collector, but Fernandez refused to relinquish the post and filed an original action for *quo warranto* and *mandamus* before the Supreme Court [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Fernandez’s appointment was legally terminated [6].

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the petitioner was holding merely a temporary appointment. Fernandez’s first appointment was probationary for six months, and the subsequent appointment he accepted was expressly designated as "temporary" [6]. It is established doctrine that a temporary appointment is terminable at any time [6]. Consequently, his termination on April 19, 1966, was valid as he had no security of tenure guaranteeing permanence in the office [6].

The petition for *quo warranto* and *mandamus* is **DENIED** [7].
