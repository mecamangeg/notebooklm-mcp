I. CAPTION
**SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, CARLATAN COCA-COLA PLANT BRANCH v. GENEROSA S. VDA. DE JOVES, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-24258, June 26, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Cresenciano Joves, a loader for San Miguel Brewery since 1947, was struck and killed by a speeding car on June 6, 1961, shortly after leaving work [1]. The company, through its supervisor and *capataz*, knew of the accident and promised aid but failed to notify the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) or controvert the liability [1, 2]. The widow filed a claim for compensation on January 31, 1962, approximately seven months after the accident [2, 3]. The hearing officer ruled in favor of the widow, and the WCC affirmed the decision [2]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the claim was barred by laches because it was filed beyond the three-month period prescribed by Section 24 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act [3]. Petitioner also raised, for the first time on appeal, that the widow allegedly received P6,000 indemnification from the criminal case against the driver [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the widow's claim is barred by laches for failing to file within the statutory period.
2. W/N the alleged indemnification from the criminal case precludes the award of compensation benefits.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The failure of a claimant to comply with the notice requirements of Section 24 of Act 3428 is non-jurisdictional [5]. Delay in giving notice is not a bar to the proceeding if it is shown that the employer had knowledge of the injury or death, or suffered no prejudice by the delay [5]. In this case, the company had knowledge of the accident but failed to report it to the Commission or controvert the claim [6, 7]. Established jurisprudence dictates that an employer's failure to report an accident constitutes a renunciation of the right to controvert the claim [7]. Being guilty of delay itself, the petitioner cannot invoke the widow's delay to avoid liability [7].

2. **NO.** The Court declined to entertain the argument regarding the alleged P6,000 indemnification from the criminal case [4]. First, this issue was never raised by the petitioner at any previous stage of the case and was only presented on appeal [4]. Second, resolving the issue would require verifying factual allegations, which is beyond the province of the Supreme Court in this review [4].

**The resolution of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is affirmed.**
