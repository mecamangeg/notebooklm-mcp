I. CAPTION
LOURDES MUNSAYAC v. BENEDICTA DE LARA and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-21151, June 26, 1968, Makalintal, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Respondent Benedicta De Lara suffered injuries while riding as a passenger on a jeepney owned and operated by petitioner Lourdes Munsayac [2]. The trial court found the driver recklessly negligent for driving at excessive speed, ignoring road repairs, and heedless of passengers' pleas [2]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal (Pasig Branch) awarded compensatory damages, P1,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P500.00 as attorney’s fees [2]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment, justifying the exemplary damages on the ground that the petitioner failed or refused to "placate the sufferings of plaintiff" after the accident, which necessitated the filing of the action [3]. Petitioner appealed via certiorari, arguing that the conduct justifying exemplary damages under Article 2232 must be coetaneous with the breach of contract, not an act subsequent to it [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the vehicle owner is liable for exemplary damages based on the driver's reckless negligence or the owner's subsequent failure to placate the victim.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that under Article 2232 of the Civil Code, the court may award exemplary damages in contracts only if the defendant acted in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent manner [3, 4]. It is difficult to conceive how a defendant could be held to have acted in such a manner for something done or not done *after* the breach—such as failing to placate the plaintiff—which has no causal connection to the breach itself [5].

The law does not contemplate vicarious liability for exemplary damages [5]. Citing *Rotea v. Halili*, the Court established that a principal is liable for exemplary damages based on an agent's wrongful act only if the principal previously authorized or knowingly ratified the act, effectively making them a co-participant [5, 6]. In this case, there was no showing of previous authority or subsequent ratification by the petitioner regarding the driver's recklessness [5]. Causative negligence is personal to the employee, and they alone should pay exemplary damages unless the owner demonstrated tolerance or approval of the wrongful act [7].

The judgment is **MODIFIED** by eliminating the award for exemplary damages, and **AFFIRMED** with respect to attorney’s fees [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles and Fernando, JJ., concurred) [8].
