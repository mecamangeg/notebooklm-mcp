I. CAPTION
HOME INSURANCE COMPANY v. AMERICAN STEAMSHIP AGENCIES, INC. and LUZON STEVEDORING CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-25599, April 4, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
"Consorcio Pesquero del Peru" shipped 21,740 jute bags of Peruvian fish meal to San Miguel Brewery, Inc. in Manila via the SS *Crowborough*, owned by American Steamship Agencies, Inc. The cargo was insured by Home Insurance Company. Upon arrival in Manila, the cargo was discharged with shortages amounting to P12,033.85. Home Insurance Company paid the consignee the insurance value of the loss (P14,870.71) and, as subrogee, filed a complaint for recovery against American Steamship and Luzon Stevedoring Corporation.

American Steamship denied liability, citing the charter party referred to in the bills of lading. The charter party stipulated that the owner (American Steamship) was liable only for loss caused by lack of due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy or by the personal act/default of the owner or manager, but was exempt from liability for loss arising from any other source, including the negligence of the captain or crew. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Home Insurance, holding the stipulation void as contrary to public policy and Article 1744 of the Civil Code regarding common carriers. American Steamship appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the stipulation in the charter party exempting the shipowner from liability for loss due to the negligence of its agents is valid.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that the strict Civil Code provisions on common carriers should not apply where the carrier is not acting as a common carrier but as a private carrier. Under American jurisprudence, which informs Philippine laws on the matter, a common carrier undertaking to carry a special cargo or chartered to a special person only becomes a private carrier. In this case, the vessel was chartered to its full and complete capacity for the use of a single party; thus, the public at large was not involved.

As a private carrier, a stipulation exempting the owner from liability for the negligence of its agents is not against public policy and is valid. The bills of lading issued were merely receipts and subject to the terms of the charter party. Since the loss was not proven to be caused by the personal negligence of the owner or manager, American Steamship Agencies, Inc. is absolved from liability.
