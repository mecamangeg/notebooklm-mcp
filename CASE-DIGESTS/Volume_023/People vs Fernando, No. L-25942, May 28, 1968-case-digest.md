I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FELIX FERNANDO, G.R. No. L-25942, May 28, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Marina David filed a complaint for grave threats against Felix Fernando in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Nueva Ecija [1]. The crime charged is punishable under Article 282, par. 2 of the Revised Penal Code with *arresto mayor* and a fine not exceeding P500.00 [1]. The CFI dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, reasoning that under the amendment to Section 87(c) of the Judiciary Act, the maximum imprisonment provided by law (*arresto mayor*) did not reach the minimum limit of the CFI's jurisdiction [1, 2]. The Government appealed, contending that despite the amendment to Section 87(c), Section 44(f) of the Judiciary Act confers concurrent jurisdiction upon the CFI and inferior courts for this offense [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has original jurisdiction over the crime of grave threats punishable by *arresto mayor* and a fine not exceeding P500.00.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the crime falls under the concurrent jurisdiction of the Municipal Court and the Court of First Instance [3].

The Court relied on the ruling in *Esperat v. Avila*, which reconciled Section 44(f) and Section 87(c) of the Judiciary Act [4]. Section 44(f) grants the CFI jurisdiction over cases where the penalty is imprisonment for *more than* 6 months OR a fine of *more than* P200.00 [5, 6]. Section 87(c) grants municipal courts jurisdiction where the penalty is imprisonment for *not more than* 3 years OR a fine of *not more than* P3,000.00 [7].

Consequently, a "zone" of concurrent jurisdiction exists where the penalty is imprisonment > 6 months but ≤ 3 years, OR a fine > P200.00 but ≤ P3,000.00 [4, 8]. Since grave threats is punishable by a fine not exceeding P500.00 (which may be more than P200.00), it falls within this concurrent zone [3, 8]. Whichever court first takes cognizance of the case acquires jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other [3].

The order of dismissal is set aside, and the case is remanded to the lower court for trial on the merits [9].
