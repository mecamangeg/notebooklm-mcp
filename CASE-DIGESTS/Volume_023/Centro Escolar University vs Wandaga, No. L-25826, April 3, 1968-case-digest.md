I. CAPTION
CENTRO ESCOLAR UNIVERSITY v. CALIXTO WANDAGA, et al. and THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-25826, April 3, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Respondents (eight janitors and one janitress) filed a petition in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against petitioner Centro Escolar University (CEU) for recovery of overtime compensation, illegal deductions, and underpayment, accompanied by a prayer for reinstatement following their dismissal in February 1965 [1, 2]. CEU moved to dismiss, arguing that the CIR lacked jurisdiction over mere money claims under the Eight-Hour Labor Law and Minimum Wage Law absent an allegation of unfair labor practice [3]. CEU also argued the case should be dismissed due to the pendency of another action, as respondents had earlier filed a claim for the same amounts before Regional Office No. 4 of the Department of Labor [3]. The CIR denied the motion, ruling it had jurisdiction because reinstatement was sought [4]. CEU filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has jurisdiction over money claims (overtime, underpayment) when the complainants seek reinstatement.
2. W/N the case should be dismissed due to the pendency of another action in the Department of Labor Regional Office.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The CIR has jurisdiction. The Supreme Court reiterated the prevailing rule that for disputes to fall under CIR jurisdiction, the employer-employee relationship must exist, or if terminated, the employee must seek reinstatement [6]. When the relationship has ceased and no reinstatement is sought, claims are mere money claims for regular courts; however, where reinstatement is sought, the claim falls within the CIR's jurisdiction [6]. Since respondents explicitly prayed for reinstatement, the principal claim and incidental money claims are cognizable by the Industrial Court [7].

2. **NO.** There is no bar due to pendency of another action. Regional offices of the Department of Labor have no jurisdiction over money claims under the Minimum Wage Law and Eight-Hour Labor Law because Section 25 of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, which purported to grant such jurisdiction, is null and void [8]. Consequently, the prior action filed in the Regional Office could not constitute a valid pending action to bar the CIR proceedings [8]. The petition was denied [9].
