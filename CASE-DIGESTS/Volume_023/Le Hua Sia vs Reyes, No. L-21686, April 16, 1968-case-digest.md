I. CAPTION
LE HUA SIA v. HON. LUIS B. REYES and CHUA AN, G.R. No. L-21686, April 16, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Le Hua Sia filed a complaint against respondent Chua An in the Municipal Court of Manila for physical injuries requiring medical attendance of 1 to 9 days. The Municipal Court found Chua An guilty and sentenced him to pay a fine of P100.00 [1]. Chua An appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. Petitioner filed a motion requesting that the records be forwarded instead to the Court of Appeals, arguing that under the Judiciary Act of 1948 (R.A. 296), as amended by R.A. 3828, appeals from city courts should go directly to the Court of Appeals because the proceedings were recorded [1, 2]. Respondent Judge Reyes denied the motion, ruling that the appeal fell within the jurisdiction of the CFI [1]. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal from the Municipal Court conviction for slight physical injuries should be elevated directly to the Court of Appeals.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the judgment is appealable to the Court of First Instance, not the Court of Appeals [4, 5].

The Court applied the doctrine laid down in *Esperat v. Avila* (1967), which distinguishes appellate jurisdiction based on the original jurisdiction of the lower court [6, 7]. Under the Judiciary Act, an appeal from a judgment of a municipal or city court in a criminal case falling within its **exclusive original jurisdiction** is appealable only to the Court of First Instance [8]. Conversely, a judgment in a case over which the lower court has **concurrent jurisdiction** with the CFI is appealable directly to the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court, provided the proceedings were recorded [8].

In this case, Chua An was charged with slight physical injuries (Art. 266, par. 1, Revised Penal Code), punishable by *arresto menor* (1 to 30 days imprisonment) [5]. This offense falls clearly within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the City Court (cases with imprisonment of 6 months or less, or fine of P200.00 or less) [5, 9]. Therefore, the appeal properly lies with the Court of First Instance [5].

The petition is denied [10].
