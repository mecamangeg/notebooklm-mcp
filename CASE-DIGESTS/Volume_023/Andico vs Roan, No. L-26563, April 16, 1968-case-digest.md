I. CAPTION
RODOLFO ANDICO v. JUDGE AMADO G. ROAN of the City Court of Manila, JUDGE CONRADO M. VASQUEZ of the Court of First Instance of Manila, and NARCISO FIDELINO Y TECSON, G.R. No. L-26563, April 16, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Narciso Fidelino was charged with serious physical injuries in the Municipal Court of Manila, an offense punishable by *arresto mayor* in its maximum period to *prision correccional* in its minimum period. The Municipal Court, presided by Respondent Judge Roan, found Fidelino guilty and sentenced him to six months of *arresto mayor*. Fidelino appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. Petitioner Rodolfo Andico contended that the appeal should have been elevated directly to the Court of Appeals, arguing that under Section 87 of the Judiciary Act as amended, the Municipal Court had concurrent jurisdiction with the CFI over the offense. The CFI Judges (originally Judge Ramos, then Respondent Judge Vasquez) overruled this contention and assumed appellate jurisdiction. Andico then filed a motion for execution with the Municipal Court, claiming the decision was final due to the failure to file a valid appeal to the proper court, but Judge Roan denied the motion. Consequently, Andico filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal from the Municipal Court's decision falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Court of First Instance acted without jurisdiction in entertaining the appeal. Relying on the doctrine in *Esperat v. Avila*, the Court explained that the Judiciary Act confers exclusive original jurisdiction on Municipal Courts only where the penalty is imprisonment for six months or less or a fine of P200 or less. The CFI has exclusive original jurisdiction where the penalty exceeds three years (or six years for city courts) or a fine of P3,000 (or P6,000). Between these limits lies a zone of **concurrent jurisdiction**.

In this case, the penalty provided by law for the offense charged (serious physical injuries) falls within this concurrent zone. Under the amendment to Section 87(c) of the Judiciary Act (R.A. No. 3828), where the Municipal Court takes cognizance of a case within its concurrent jurisdiction, the decision "shall be appealable direct to the Court of Appeals or to the Supreme Court." Therefore, the CFI lacked appellate jurisdiction.

The petition for **prohibition is GRANTED**, and Respondent Judge Vasquez is ordered to elevate the records to the Court of Appeals. The petition for **mandamus is DENIED** because the judgment was not yet final and executory, as the appeal had been perfected in due time, albeit transmitted to the wrong court.
