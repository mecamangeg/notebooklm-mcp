I. CAPTION
**BERNARDA NAZAL, assisted by her husband Ceferino Nazal v. HON. FELICIANO BELMONTE, Judge, CFI of Baguio and JUANA F. CATBAGAN, assisted by her husband Bernardino Catbagan**, G.R. No. L-24410, May 23, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Juana F. Catbagan and Faro Cabading were conflicting claimants/squatters on a portion of the "MRR Lot" in Baguio City, which was originally reserved for the Manila Railroad Company but later declared disposable public land. In Civil Case No. 743, the Court of First Instance (CFI) rendered a judgment ordering Cabading to vacate the land and pay sums of money to Catbagan. This decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals and became final and executory on November 9, 1964.

Subsequently, the government proceeded with the sale of the lots. Cabading applied to purchase the area he occupied and later conveyed his interest to Petitioner Bernarda Nazal. Nazal pursued the application. When Catbagan moved for the execution of the final judgment in Civil Case No. 743 in March 1965, Nazal opposed it and filed a separate action to stay execution, citing the administrative processing of the land sale. Respondent Judge Belmonte overruled the opposition and ordered the execution. Nazal filed the instant petition. During the pendency of this case, Nazal was awarded the land at a government auction and was issued Original Certificate of Title No. P-566 on February 9, 1966.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the final and executory judgment for ejectment in Civil Case No. 743 may be executed against Nazal despite the subsequent sale of the land to her by the Government and the issuance of a title in her name.

IV. RULING
**NO.** Although it is generally the ministerial duty of the court to execute a final and executory judgment, this rule is subject to exceptions. It is well-settled that when facts and circumstances transpire after a judgment has become final which render its execution impossible or unjust, the interested party may ask the court to stay its execution or prevent its enforcement.

The Supreme Court applied the doctrine in *Hernandez v. Clapis* and *Realiza v. Duarte*, holding that the subsequent approval of a sales/homestead application and issuance of title by the Director of Lands—who has executive control over the disposition of public domain—legalizes the possession of the applicant. In this case, the sale of the land to Nazal and the issuance of her Torrens title constitute supervening events that reversed the legal position of the parties. Catbagan is now barred from enforcing the possessory right adjudged in Civil Case No. 743 because she ceased to be entitled to such relief. However, the money portion of the judgment (damages/rentals) is not within the scope of the Director of Lands' control and may still be executed.

Petition granted. The order of execution is annulled but only insofar as the ejectment from and recovery of possession of the disputed land is concerned.
