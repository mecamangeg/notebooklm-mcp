I. CAPTION
**JUAN YSASI v. HON. JOSE F. FERNANDEZ, as Presiding Judge of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental (Bacolod City, Branch V), MARIA ALDECOA DE YSASI and JON YSASI**, G.R. No. L-28593, June 25, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Juan Ysasi and private respondent Maria Aldecoa de Ysasi are spouses who own *Hacienda Manucao-A* in Negros Occidental as conjugal property. Juan administered the property, shuttling between Spain and the Philippines. In 1965, their son, respondent Jon Ysasi, became the manager. In June 1967, Jon resigned, and Juan appointed Valentin Bilbao as the new manager. However, Jon refused to turn over the hacienda to Bilbao, claiming his mother, Maria, had already taken possession and administration.

Maria filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental for administration of the conjugal properties or separation of property, alleging that Juan abandoned her and was unfit to manage due to his age (77) and blindness in one eye. She prayed for the appointment of a receiver *pendente lite*. The respondent Judge initially granted the receivership *ex parte* but later set it aside. However, the Judge subsequently issued an order on December 22, 1967, denying Juan’s motion for a preliminary mandatory injunction to regain possession and announcing that the hacienda would be placed under the receivership of the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) if no objection was raised. Juan filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the husband may be deprived of his sole administration of the conjugal partnership property and the property placed under receivership based on mere allegations of abuse of administration.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the husband is the sole administrator of the conjugal partnership, a right clearly granted by **Article 165 of the Civil Code**. The wife is not entitled to joint administration as a matter of right and may even be punished for contempt for refusing to deliver conjugal assets to the husband.

While **Article 167 of the Civil Code** allows the courts to remove the husband's administration and appoint a receiver or the wife as administrator, this remedy is conditioned specifically "in case of abuse of powers of administration." The Court emphasized that the husband cannot be divested of his administration upon mere *allegations* of fraud or abuse; these must be proven. The law presumes good faith (*fraus est odiosa et non praesumenda*).

The Court further ruled that receivership is a harsh remedy to be granted with extreme caution. Its purpose is to preserve *existing* rights, not to destroy the husband's statutory right to administer based on unproven charges. Consequently, the trial court's refusal to issue the mandatory injunction to restore the husband's possession was incorrect.

**Petition GRANTED.** The orders of the respondent Judge were annulled. The Judge was directed to issue a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction compelling respondents Maria and Jon Ysasi to turn over possession and control of the hacienda to petitioner Juan Ysasi, subject to the filing of a P50,000 bond.
