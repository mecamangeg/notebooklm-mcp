I. CAPTION
URDANETA RURAL BANK v. FELIX SAN JUAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-28346, June 29, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
In Civil Case U-902, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan rendered judgment ordering Urdaneta Rural Bank (Bank) to vacate a property leased from spouses Felix San Juan and Manuela Nolasco and to pay rentals [1]. On December 20, 1966, the trial court ordered execution pending appeal upon the spouses' filing of a P5,000 bond [1]. The Bank appealed the main judgment to the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. 39103) and sought to stay the execution, but the motion was denied [2].

Subsequently, the trial court issued an *alias* writ of execution on June 27, 1967 [2]. The Bank filed a separate action in the CFI to set aside this writ and recover damages, arguing the trial court lacked jurisdiction to issue it due to the pending appeal [3]. The CFI dismissed this complaint, ruling it could not annul orders of a coordinate branch [3]. The Bank appealed this dismissal to the Supreme Court. During the pendency of this appeal, the Court of Appeals dismissed the Bank’s appeal in the main case (Civil Case U-902) for failure to file a brief, making the judgment final [2]. Additionally, the Bank filed its appellant's brief for the instant case 25 days late [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the appeal must be dismissed on two grounds.

First, the appeal has become moot. With the dismissal of the Bank's appeal in the main case (Civil Case U-902) by the Court of Appeals, the decision ordering eviction and payment of rentals became final and executory [5]. Consequently, the power of the trial court to execute its judgment is "beyond question" [5]. The Bank's claim for damages was merely incidental to the alleged invalidity of the writ; since the judgment is final and executory, the writ is valid [5].

Second, the Bank failed to file its appellant's brief on time. The brief was due on February 14, 1968, but was only filed on March 11, 1968, which was 25 days past the deadline [4].

Appeal dismissed [4].
