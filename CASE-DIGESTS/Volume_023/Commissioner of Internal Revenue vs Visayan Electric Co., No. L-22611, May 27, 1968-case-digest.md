**I. CAPTION**
**COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. VISAYAN ELECTRIC COMPANY and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS**, G.R. No. L-22611, May 27, 1968, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Visayan Electric Company (VECO), a holder of a legislative franchise (Act 3499) to operate an electric light and power system in Cebu, established an "Employees' Reserve for Pensions" in 1949. VECO set aside monthly amounts from its gross operating receipts for this fund and invested it in stocks of San Miguel Brewery, Inc. VECO received dividends from these investments but did not declare them for income tax purposes, believing they were covered by the tax exemption clause in its franchise or subject only to franchise tax.

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed VECO for deficiency income tax on these dividends for the years 1953-1958, claiming the fund was controlled by VECO and subject to corporate income tax. Additionally, the CIR assessed a 25% surcharge for alleged late payment of franchise taxes for 1957-1959, arguing that VECO’s franchise requirement that taxes be "due and payable quarterly" meant they were due immediately at the end of the quarter, whereas VECO paid them within 20 days after the quarter ended. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled in favor of VECO, canceling both the income tax deficiency and the franchise tax surcharge. The CIR appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N VECO is liable for income tax on the dividends derived from the employees' reserve fund.
2. W/N VECO is liable for the 25% surcharge for the alleged late payment of franchise tax.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** VECO is liable, but as a trustee for **individual income tax**, not corporate income tax. The Court held that VECO’s board resolution created a valid express trust where VECO acted as a trustee for the sole benefit of its employees. Therefore, the dividends are not "receipts, revenues and profits" of the company itself, which would be exempt under Sec. 8 of its franchise (Act 3499), but rather income of the trust estate.

Furthermore, the trust does not qualify for tax exemption as an "employees' trust" under Republic Act 1983 (amending Sec. 56 of the Tax Code) because VECO failed to prove the existence of a definite, actuarially sound "pension plan" required by law. Consequently, the income is subject to the taxes imposed upon individuals under **Sec. 56(a) in relation to Sec. 21 of the National Internal Revenue Code**. However, the Court ruled that the 50% surcharge for fraud/neglect (Sec. 72) was not applicable as VECO acted in good faith.

2. **NO.** The phrase "due and payable quarterly" in VECO's franchise merely indicates the **frequency** of payment (every three months), not the specific deadline. Since the franchise does not specify a time limit, **Sec. 183(a) of the Tax Code** applies pursuant to **Sec. 259**. Sec. 183(a) allows payment within twenty (20) days after the end of each quarter. VECO paid its taxes within this period; thus, the 25% surcharge for late payment does not attach.

*The judgment of the CTA is AFFIRMED regarding the franchise tax surcharge and REVERSED regarding the income tax liability. The case is remanded to the CTA for computation of the tax liability of the trust.*
