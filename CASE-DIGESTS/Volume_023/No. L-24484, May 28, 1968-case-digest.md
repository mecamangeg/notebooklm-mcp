I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RAMON NARCISO Y CONTRERAS, ET AL.,** G.R. No. L-24484, May 28, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of July 10, 1961, Roberto Monreal, a detention prisoner in Cell 2-A of the Manila City Jail, was beaten to death. The accused—Ramon Narciso, Elias Gloria, Francisco Celso, and Rufino Peña—were charged with murder. A lone eyewitness, inmate Bernardo Villalon, saw Gloria beating the victim but did not see the others participate. However, separate extrajudicial confessions were obtained from all accused, admitting their participation in the killing due to a gang feud between the "Sigue-Sigue" (accused's gang) and "Bahala Na" (victim's gang). Peña signed a confession (Exh. K) admitting he struck the victim but later repudiated it during trial, claiming it was extorted through torture. The trial court convicted Peña of Murder and sentenced him to death, relying on his confession and the *corpus delicti*. The case against Narciso was dismissed due to his death, Gloria escaped, and Celso was dismissed for insufficiency of evidence. The case was automatically reviewed by the Supreme Court regarding Peña.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the extrajudicial confessions of the co-accused are admissible against Peña.
2. W/N Peña’s extrajudicial confession is voluntary and admissible.
3. W/N Peña is guilty of consummated Murder.

IV. RULING
1. **YES** (Qualified). While the general rule is that extrajudicial declarations of a co-accused are hearsay against another, they may be considered as circumstantial evidence to determine the credibility of the accused's own confession or testimony when the confessions are "interlocking"—i.e., made by several accused without collusion and are identical in material respects [1-3]. The Court found the confessions of Gloria, Celso, Narciso, and Peña to be substantially in accord, corroborating Peña's participation.

2. **YES**. The Court rejected Peña's claim of torture because he failed to present the medical evidence he claimed to have and did not call the examining doctor to testify [4]. Furthermore, the confession contained details that were responsive and informative, and the inconsistencies between the various accused's statements regarding the sequence of the hitting indicated a lack of collusion or police fabrication [5, 6]. A confession corroborated by evidence of *corpus delicti* is sufficient for conviction, even without an eyewitness seeing the specific acts of the accused [7].

3. **NO**. Peña is guilty only of **Attempted Murder**. Since no conspiracy was alleged in the information or proven, Peña is liable only for the consequences of his own acts [8, 9]. His confession stated he hit the victim while the victim's face was covered by a blanket. The medical evidence showed a superficial wound on the face and fatal wounds on the back of the head. The Court concluded Peña’s blow likely caused only the superficial wound, while the fatal blows were inflicted by the others later [10, 11]. As he had intent to kill but failed to perform all acts of execution to produce the felony due to extraneous causes (poor aim or lack of force), the crime is attempted murder [9].

**DISPOSITION:** The decision is MODIFIED. Rufino Peña is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of *prision correccional* to eight (8) years of *prision mayor*, and to pay indemnity.
