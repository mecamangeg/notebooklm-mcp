I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CHAW YAW SHUN @ GEORGE CHUA, VICTORIO ALVAREZ, DIONISIO CARASIG, and JOHN DOES**, G.R. No. L-19590, April 25, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Hector Crisostomo, an officer of the Presidential Fact Finding Committee, was found dead with gunshot wounds in Marilao, Bulacan on July 15, 1959. Investigation led to the arrest of Victorio Alvarez, who confessed and implicated appellant Chaw Yaw Shun (George Chua) as the mastermind who hired him for P35,000.00. Chua surrendered to authorities and initially denied participation. However, on August 26, 1959, he was taken from Camp Crame to Alabang at midnight, where he executed a written confession. At trial, Chua repudiated the confession, alleging it was extracted through torture, including electric shock and physical beatings. Medical examinations requested by his lawyer revealed abrasions, scratches, and reddish marks on his body, though government doctors noted no external signs of internal injury. The Court of First Instance of Bulacan convicted Chua and Alvarez of murder. Alvarez withdrew his appeal, leaving Chua as the sole appellant.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellant's extrajudicial confession is admissible in evidence.
2. W/N conspiracy was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The confession is involuntary and inadmissible. A confession induced by torture or violence is void (*People v. Tipay*). The Court found that the medical findings of "reddish marks and scratch abrasions" on Chua's body corroborated his complaints of maltreatment. The Court rejected the argument that the lack of severe external injuries negated torture, noting that methods such as electric shock or sitting on the stomach do not necessarily produce external marks. The suspicious transfer of the appellant to a remote location (Alabang) at midnight for interrogation further indicated the confession was not voluntary. Additionally, the confession contained material improbabilities and falsities when compared to independent evidence, such as referencing a phone call from a person proved to be out of the country at the time.

2. **NO.** Conspiracy must be proved by independent evidence other than the confession. The confession of a co-accused (Alvarez) is hearsay against the appellant and was repudiated at trial. With Chua's own confession excluded, there was no independent evidence of any overt act connecting him to the crime. The Court also gave credence to Chua's alibi that he was playing mahjong in Pasay City, which was corroborated by witnesses and records.

Decision reversed and appellant acquitted.
