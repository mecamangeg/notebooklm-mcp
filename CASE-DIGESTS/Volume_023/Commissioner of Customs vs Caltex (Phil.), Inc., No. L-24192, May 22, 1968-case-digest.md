I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS v. CALTEX (PHILIPPINES), INC. and COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-24192, May 22, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
From January to September 1959, respondent Caltex (Philippines), Inc. imported 32 shipments of goods. Under Section 1 of Republic Act No. 1394, the special import tax rate for 1959 was scheduled to be 11.9% [1, 2]. However, the Collector of Customs assessed the shipments at 17% (for Jan-June) and 15.3% (for the rest), amounting to a total payment of P125,138.00 [1]. This assessment was based on Section 2 of RA 1394, which authorizes the President to increase the rate if revenue falls below 1955 levels, and Proclamation No. 601 issued on July 14, 1959, which fixed the rate at 15.3% "starting from January 1, 1959" [3, 4].

Caltex protested, claiming the applicable rate was 11.9%. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled in favor of Caltex, holding that Proclamation No. 601 only became effective 15 days after its publication in the Official Gazette (September 22, 1959), i.e., on October 8, 1959 [1, 5]. The CTA ordered a refund of P33,766.00 based on the 11.9% rate [6]. The Commissioner of Customs petitioned for review [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Proclamation No. 601 is effective starting January 1, 1959, thereby subjecting the subject importations to the increased tax rate of 15.3%.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court modified the CTA decision, ruling that the applicable rate is 15.3%.

The Court held that the phrase "succeeding calendar year" in Section 2 of RA 1394 refers to the year following the year of the revenue shortfall, not the year following the issuance of the proclamation [7]. It is impossible to issue the proclamation before the start of the succeeding year because the revenue data for the preceding year would not yet be complete [8].

Furthermore, Proclamation No. 601 explicitly stated it was effective "during the calendar year 1959, starting from January 1" [9]. While Section 11 of the Revised Administrative Code provides that statutes take effect 15 days after publication, this rule applies only "in the absence of special provision" or unless "otherwise provided" [9]. Since the Proclamation specified its own effectivity date, the general rule on publication does not apply [9]. Finally, the retroactive application does not violate the prohibition against *ex post facto* laws because tax laws are not penal in nature [10].

The correct tax due was calculated at the 15.3% rate, reducing the refundable amount to Caltex to P7,571.00 [11].
