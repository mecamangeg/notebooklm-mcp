I. CAPTION
VICTORIA VDA. DE BUNGKAS, ET AL. v. NATIONAL WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY, G.R. No. L-25572, June 22, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Eleuterio Bungkas was an employee of the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA). He worked as a pipe-fitter, digging soil and laying pipes, from 1945 to 1949. In 1950, he was reassigned as a security guard, a position he held until his death in 1956. The cause of death was "acute nephritis, due to uremia and acute cardiac dilatation." His widow (petitioner) filed a claim for death benefits. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) denied the claim, finding that while nephritis could be caused by "cold and wet" conditions associated with pipe-fitting, the disease would have manifested between 1945 and 1949. Since the first symptoms only appeared in 1953—four years after he left the pipe-fitting job—the WCC ruled the time gap was too long to establish a service connection. The petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the deceased's illness and subsequent death were service-connected and compensable under the Workmen’s Compensation Act.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the findings of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission. The Court reasoned that if the "cold and wet" factors inherent in the deceased's work as a pipe-fitter caused the disease, it would have manifested during his tenure in that position (1945-1949), not in 1953. The four-year time gap was deemed too long to justify a conclusion that the sickness was service-induced. Furthermore, the Court noted that there is nothing peculiar in the work of a security guard that could have caused the sickness or predisposed the deceased to it.

The decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is affirmed.
