I. CAPTION
MIGUEL PEREZ RUBIO v. THE HON. SAMUEL REYES, ROBERT O. PHILLIPS, MAGDALENA YSMAEL PHILLIPS, ROBERT O. PHILLIPS & SONS, INC., MANUFACTURERS BANK & TRUST COMPANY, VICTORIA VALLEY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, and HACIENDA BENITO, INC., G.R. No. L-24581, May 27, 1968, 23 SCRA 773, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Miguel Perez Rubio and his wife sold their shares of stock in Hacienda Benito, Inc. to respondent Robert O. Phillips & Sons, Inc. for P5,500,000.00. Phillips paid the initial installments but failed to pay the balance of P4,250,000.00. The parties restructured the payment, guaranteed by respondent Phillips spouses. When Phillips negotiated to sell the shares to Alfonso Yuchengco, Rubio warned the parties that the shares were subject to the unpaid balance.

To prevent Rubio from interfering with the sale to Yuchengco and collecting the debt, Phillips filed Civil Case No. 8632. Respondent Judge Samuel Reyes issued an *ex-parte* writ of preliminary injunction restraining Rubio from collecting the unpaid balance. Rubio filed a motion to dissolve the writ, which was denied, prompting this petition for certiorari. During the pendency of this case, respondent Manufacturers Bank & Trust Company (MBTC) foreclosed mortgages on Hacienda Benito’s properties. A compromise was reached where Hacienda Benito conveyed its properties to MBTC to settle debts of the Phillips group. Rubio filed supplemental petitions alleging this foreclosure and subsequent transfer to Victoria Valley Development Corporation were part of a conspiracy to defraud him by depleting the assets available for his claim.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the *ex-parte* writ of preliminary injunction restraining the petitioner from collecting the unpaid debt.
2. W/N the Supreme Court can annul the foreclosure proceedings and conveyance of properties based on the allegations of conspiracy and fraud in the present certiorari action.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The issuance of the writ *ex-parte* was unjust and improvident. The Court held that restraining a creditor from enforcing his undenied right to collect from his debtor and the latter’s guarantors a sum representing the unpaid balance of the purchase price, without hearing and legal justification, constitutes "rank injustice" [1]. The debtor corporation and its guarantors did not deny the indebtedness, yet attempted to sell the shares without provision for payment. The Court ruled that preventing a creditor from enforcing his right to collect in any lawful manner is a grave abuse of discretion [1].

2. **NO.** The conflicting allegations regarding the foreclosure, the compromise agreement, and the alleged conspiracy to defraud the petitioner inevitably give rise to questions of fact which are not within the power of the Supreme Court to decide in an action for certiorari [2]. Certiorari involves exclusively questions of jurisdiction. Questions of fact, such as the existence of a conspiracy or the validity of the foreclosure, must be subjected to an ordinary trial where parties can present evidence. The Court lacks authority to decide these factual issues upon mere allegations in the pleadings [2].

**Disposition:** The writ of preliminary injunction issued by the respondent judge is declared NULL AND VOID and set aside. The petition for certiorari to annul the judicial proceedings in the foreclosure case (Civil Case 8766) is DENIED without prejudice to petitioner's right to file a separate action. All counterclaims are DISMISSED.
