I. CAPTION
LIBERATION STEAMSHIP CO., INC. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and THE UNLICENSED CREW MEMBERS OF THE THREE (3) DOÑA VESSELS, ALL AFFILIATES WlTH THE PHILIPPINE MARITIME INDUSTRIAL UNION (PMIU), et al., G.R. Nos. L-25389 & L-25390, June 27, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner National Development Company (NDC), a government-owned corporation, sold its three vessels ("Doña Alicia", "Doña Nati", and "Doña Aurora") to petitioner Liberation Steamship Co., Inc. (LISTCO) in 1961 [1]. The crew members, represented by PMIU, went on strike on April 15, 1961, after the deed of sale failed to provide for their retention [1]. The dispute was certified to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [1]. On April 29, 1961, the CIR impleaded LISTCO as an indispensable party [2, 3]. On May 3, 1961, the CIR issued a return-to-work order directing the "management of NDC" to reinstate strikers and refrain from dismissing employees [2, 4]. Despite this, on June 17, 1961, LISTCO ejected the crew of "Doña Alicia" and replaced them with new men [5]. NDC later rescinded the sale and repossessed the vessels in 1962 [6, 7].

The Trial Judge held NDC liable for backwages but exonerated LISTCO [7]. The CIR *en banc* modified the decision, holding both NDC and LISTCO solidarily liable for backwages, reasoning that LISTCO was a party with knowledge of the restraining order [8]. It also granted 10 months of accumulated leave pay under Republic Act No. 1081 and reopened the case regarding gratuity pay claims [9]. LISTCO and NDC filed separate petitions questioning the CIR's jurisdiction, the award of backwages, leave benefits, and the reopening of the gratuity claim [10, 11].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N LISTCO was correctly included as a party and bound by the CIR's restraining order.
2. W/N LISTCO and NDC are solidarily liable for the backwages of the ejected crew.
3. W/N the crew members are entitled to accumulated sick and vacation leaves despite the silence of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
4. W/N the CIR erred in reopening the case to determine entitlement to gratuity pay.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** LISTCO was properly impleaded as an indispensable party because, as the new owner of the vessels, no final determination of the case could be had without it [12]. The May 3 order directing "management" to reinstate workers applied to LISTCO, as it possessed the power to admit or discharge employees [12].
2. **YES.** LISTCO acted in bad faith by ejecting the crew of "Doña Alicia" on June 21, 1961, with actual knowledge of the May 3 restraining order prohibiting unauthorized dismissals [13]. NDC also defied the order by enjoining the crew to debark [14]. Their "cooperation and concordant action" in violating the court's order justify holding them solidarily liable for the backwages of the ejected crew [14].
3. **YES.** The law forms part of, and is read into, every contract unless clearly excluded [15]. Since NDC is a government-owned corporation, the provisions of the Administrative Code (Secs. 284-286) and RA 1081 regarding leave benefits apply to its employees [16]. The fact that the CBA did not contain provisions on accumulated leaves does not bar resort to the law, as there was no showing the parties intended to exclude these legal benefits [15, 17].
4. **YES.** While normally discretionary, a gratuity may become regarded as part of regular compensation by reason of its "long and regular concession" [18]. The CIR properly reopened the case to receive evidence on whether such conditions existed to support the employees' demand [18].

Resolution affirmed [18].
