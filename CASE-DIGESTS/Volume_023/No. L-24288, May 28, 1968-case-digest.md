I. CAPTION
LEONOR MANUEL CASTILLO UDAN v. THE HON. MUNICIPAL JUDGE QUIRICO C. AMON, ETC., and BEATRIZ CASTAÑEDA, G.R. No. L-24288, May 28, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
This case involves a dispute over two cadastral lots in Zambales. Previously, the trial court adjudicated the lots to respondent Beatriz Castañeda without hearing petitioner Leonor Udan's evidence. Udan appealed, and the Supreme Court (in G.R. No. L-18372) remanded the case specifically to give Udan the opportunity to present her evidence of ownership [1, 2].

Upon remand, respondent Judge Amon set the hearing for August 27, 1964. On the day of the hearing, Udan submitted a motion to postpone the trial to the *following day* because her counsel had conflicting court appearances in Olongapo [3]. Judge Amon denied the motion because it did not comply with the three-day notice rule and counsel should not have presumed it would be granted. He immediately revived the previous order adjudicating the property to Castañeda [3, 4]. Udan filed motions for reconsideration, which were denied, prompting this petition for certiorari [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the motion for postponement and reviving the adjudication in favor of the private respondent.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the respondent Judge gravely abused his discretion. While motions for postponement are addressed to the sound discretion of the courts, this discretion must be exercised wisely to serve the ends of justice and fairness, rather than merely the convenience of the court or parties [6, 7].

The Court cited *McEntee v. Manotok*, establishing that two circumstances must be considered: (1) the reasonableness of the postponement and (2) the merits of the movant's case [8]. Here, the request was reasonable as it was for only one day and was the first postponement requested after remand, proving no intent to delay [6, 9]. Furthermore, the case was remanded by the Supreme Court precisely because Udan's claim of ownership was meritorious enough to warrant the presentation of evidence [10]. The Court emphasized that procedural rules should not be applied so rigidly as to defeat substantial justice and prejudice a party's substantial rights [11].

The petition is **GRANTED**. The orders of the respondent Judge are set aside, and he is ordered to reopen the proceedings to receive petitioner's evidence [12].
