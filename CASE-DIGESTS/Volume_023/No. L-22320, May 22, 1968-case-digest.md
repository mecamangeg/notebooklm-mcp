I. CAPTION
MERCEDES RUTH COBB-PEREZ and DAMASO P. PEREZ v. HON. GREGORIO LANTIN, RICARDO P. HERMOSO, and the CITY SHERIFF OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-22320, May 22, 1968, 23 SCRA 637, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Ricardo Hermoso obtained a final money judgment for P17,309.44 against Petitioner Damaso Perez for unpaid leather materials used in Perez's shoe manufacturing business. The Sheriff levied upon shares of stock registered in Damaso’s name at Republic Bank. Damaso initially challenged the levy only as excessive, without questioning the ownership nature of the shares. Subsequently, his wife, Petitioner Mercedes Cobb-Perez, filed various actions (injunctions and third-party claims) to stop the execution, arguing the shares were conjugal assets and could not be used to satisfy Damaso's "personal" debt. After these attempts failed, Damaso filed a motion to quash the writ of execution in the lower court presided by Judge Lantin, adopting his wife's arguments. The motion was denied, prompting the spouses to file a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the writ of execution should be quashed on the ground that the levied shares are conjugal property and the judgment debt is merely personal to the husband.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the petition.

First, the Court ruled that the grounds to quash a writ of execution are limited to instances where the writ is defective, issued without authority, or the debt has been paid (*Dimayuga v. Raymundo*). None of these grounds were present; petitioners attacked the levy, not the writ itself. The proper remedy was an independent action to enjoin the Sheriff, which petitioners had already exhausted or abandoned.

Second, Damaso Perez was estopped from claiming the shares were conjugal, as he had represented them as his exclusive property in previous proceedings regarding the excessiveness of the levy.

Third, petitioners failed to prove the shares were conjugal. The presumption of conjugal ownership under Art. 160 of the Civil Code applies only when there is proof that the property was acquired during the marriage (*Camia de Reyes v. Reyes de Ilano*). Since there was no evidence of when the shares were acquired, and they were registered solely in the husband's name, they were deemed his exclusive property (*Maramba v. Lozano*).

Finally, even if the shares were conjugal, they are liable for the debt. Debts contracted by the husband in the exercise of an industry or profession (the shoe business) by which he contributes to the support of the family are not exclusive private debts but are chargeable to the conjugal partnership (*Javier v. Osmeña*).

The petition was **DISMISSED**, the preliminary injunction dissolved, and treble costs were assessed against the petitioners to be paid by their counsel.
