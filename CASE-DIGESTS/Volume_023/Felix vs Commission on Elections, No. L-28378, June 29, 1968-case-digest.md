I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO P. FELIX, et al. v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS and THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF CAINTA, RIZAL, G.R. No. L-28378, June 29, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Francisco P. Felix and Felix de la Paz were proclaimed Mayor and Vice-Mayor, respectively, of Cainta, Rizal, by the Municipal Board of Canvassers on November 16, 1967 [1]. Eleven days later, on November 27, 1967, their opponents, Gregorio Cruz and Julian Francisco, filed an election protest with the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Case No. 10406) alleging that the canvass did not reflect the actual results [2].

On the same day, Cruz and Francisco also filed a petition with the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to annul the canvass and proclamation, claiming they were based on an "admittedly mistaken election entry" in Precinct No. 5 and "falsified and/or altered election returns" [3]. The alleged mistake in Precinct No. 5 involved a claim by some inspectors that they erroneously credited votes due to fatigue, though one inspector did not sign the statement attesting to this error [4]. On November 28, 1967, the COMELEC issued an order setting aside the proclamation and directing a new canvass using authentic copies of returns [5]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court to annul the COMELEC order [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the COMELEC acted with grave abuse of discretion in annulling the canvass and proclamation after an election protest had already been filed in court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court annulled the COMELEC's order and made the restraining order permanent [7].

The Court held that once a candidate has been proclaimed and an election protest is filed, the question of whether the election returns reflect the true result must be elucidated and decided in said election protest, not in an administrative proceeding before the COMELEC [8].

Regarding the alleged "mistaken entry" in Precinct No. 5, the Court ruled that a correction under Section 154 of the Revised Election Code requires the unanimous consent of the board of inspectors. Since one inspector did not sign the statement of error, the proceeding is contentious and cannot be effected *ex parte* or without notice to the adverse party [4, 9].

Furthermore, the Board of Canvassers may only suspend a canvass if: (1) there are discrepancies in authentic copies of returns; (2) there is a discrepancy between votes in words and figures; (3) the return is clearly falsified on its face; or (4) it is illegible. None of these circumstances were present [10]. The allegation that returns were falsified based merely on a party's tabulation is insufficient to authorize the annulment of the canvass and proclamation [11]. The petition was granted, and the COMELEC order was annulled [7].
