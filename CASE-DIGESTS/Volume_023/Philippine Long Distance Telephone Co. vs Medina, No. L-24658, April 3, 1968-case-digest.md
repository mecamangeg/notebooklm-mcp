I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE COMPANY v. MEDINA AND NOBLEJAS, G.R. No. L-24658, April 3, 1968, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
Public Service Commissioner Enrique Medina issued an order requiring petitioner PLDT to explain why the telephone application of Cesar Bautista had not been installed and endorsed a new application for respondent Oscar Noblejas. PLDT explained that service to Noblejas could not be provided immediately because there were numerous prior applications in his area that had to be served first [1, 2]. Commissioner Medina rejected this, arguing that priority should be based on the date of the Public Service Commission's (PSC) approval of the application rather than the date of filing with PLDT [3]. Medina ordered PLDT to install Noblejas' telephone immediately and imposed a fine of P50.00 per day for non-compliance [4]. PLDT appealed, contending the PSC could not disregard the priority of earlier applicants filed with the company [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission can compel PLDT to prioritize an applicant based on the date of PSC approval over earlier applications filed with PLDT.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the Commission's orders. The Court ruled that priority in granting telephone service is not determined by the date of approval by the Public Service Commission because such approval is not required for connections [6]. Citing *PLDT v. Medina* (G.R. No. L-24340), the Court reiterated that conditions requiring PSC approval were previously removed and deleted [6]. Instead, priority must be determined by the dates of filing the application with PLDT, in accordance with the general rule under Section 3 of Public Act 3436 (PLDT's franchise) [6]. Therefore, respondent Noblejas was not entitled to installation ahead of prior applicants [6].

The appealed orders were **reversed and set aside**, and the complaint against PLDT was **dismissed** [7].
