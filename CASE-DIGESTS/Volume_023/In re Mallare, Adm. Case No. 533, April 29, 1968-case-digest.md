I. CAPTION
IN RE: FLORENCIO MALLARE, Adm. Case No. 533, April 29, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., Actg. C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Florencio Mallare was admitted to the Philippine Bar in March 1962. Shortly thereafter, the Acting Commissioner of Immigration denounced him as a Chinese national masquerading as a Filipino and requested his disbarment. Mallare maintained he was a Filipino based on two grounds: (1) his father, Esteban Mallare, was a Filipino citizen by choice, being the illegitimate son of a Chinese father and a Filipina mother; and (2) a 1960 decision by the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon in Civil Case No. 329-G (a suit for recovery of land) and Special Proceeding No. 3925 (correction of birth records) had already declared him a Filipino.

The evidence showed, however, that Mallare and his siblings were registered as children of Chinese parents at birth; his father's death certificate stated the father was Chinese; and Mallare himself had registered as an alien in 1942 and 1950, thumbprinting an application that stated he was Chinese.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent is a Filipino citizen.
2. W/N the previous CFI decisions declaring respondent a Filipino constitute *res judicata* binding on the Supreme Court.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court found the evidence preponderant, if not overwhelming, that respondent’s father, Esteban, was and remained Chinese until his death. Consequently, respondent's mother retained her Chinese citizenship, and respondent remained a Chinese national *jus sanguinis*. The claim that the father was the illegitimate son of a Filipina was rejected because persons living together as husband and wife are presumed married (Rule 131, par. bb), and there was no proof the grandmother was a Filipino citizen at the time. Respondent's acts of registering as an alien and the vital records of the family contradicted his claim.

2. **NO.** The declaration of citizenship in Civil Case No. 329-G did not constitute *res judicata*. The case was an action *in personam* regarding land ownership; the pronouncement on citizenship was merely incidental and beyond judicial power, as there is no law authorizing the institution of a judicial proceeding to declare the citizenship of an individual (*Channie Tan v. Republic*). Similarly, the proceeding to correct birth records was not *in rem* and did not bind the State, nor was the State properly represented to contest the issue of citizenship.

Respondent is declared excluded from the practice of law, his admission to the Philippine bar is revoked, and he is ordered to return his lawyer's diploma.
