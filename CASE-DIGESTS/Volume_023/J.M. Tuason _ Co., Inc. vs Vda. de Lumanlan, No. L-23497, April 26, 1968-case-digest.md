I. CAPTION
J.M. TUASON & CO., INC. v. ESTRELLA VDA. DE LUMANLAN, G.R. No. L-23497, April 26, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., Actg. C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. (Tuason), the registered owner of the Santa Mesa Heights Subdivision under TCT No. 1267, filed a complaint for ejectment in 1959 against respondent Estrella Vda. de Lumanlan [1, 2]. Lumanlan had occupied an 800-square-meter lot within the subdivision since 1949, claiming she bought it from Pedro Deudor [2, 3]. She invoked a Compromise Agreement between Tuason and the Deudors, arguing it legalized her possession and entitled her to purchase the lot [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Tuason, ordering Lumanlan to vacate and pay damages [1]. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Compromise Agreement obligated Tuason to sell the lot to Lumanlan at a reasonable price pursuant to Article 1474 of the Civil Code [4, 5]. Tuason appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Lumanlan can enforce the Compromise Agreement to compel Tuason to sell the lot to her.
2. W/N Lumanlan is a builder in good faith.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Lumanlan cannot derive rights from the Compromise Agreement because she expressly assailed it in her answer, alleging it was a conspiracy between Tuason and the Deudors executed without her consent [6, 7]. Furthermore, the Compromise Agreement only granted Deudor-buyers a preferential right to purchase at "current prices" and required them to recognize Tuason's title and sign new contracts [8, 9]. Lumanlan failed to meet these conditions and instead repudiated Tuason's ownership [6]. Consequently, Article 1474 of the Civil Code regarding "reasonable price" is inapplicable as there was no contract of sale between the parties [10].

2. **NO.** Lumanlan is not a builder in good faith because she is deemed to have presumptive knowledge of Tuason's Torrens title, which has been issued since 1914 [11]. By failing to make the necessary inquiry and choosing to rely on the Deudors' claim despite the registered title, she is bound conclusively by Tuason's title and cannot pretend good faith [12].

The petition is **GRANTED**. The decision of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED** and that of the Court of First Instance is **REINSTATED** [13].
