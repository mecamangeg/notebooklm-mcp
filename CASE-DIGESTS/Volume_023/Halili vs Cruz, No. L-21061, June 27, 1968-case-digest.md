**I. CAPTION**
FORTUNATO F. HALILI v. RUPERTO CRUZ, G.R. No. L-21061, June 27, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Ruperto Cruz applied with the Public Service Commission (PSC) for a certificate of public convenience to operate ten buses on the line between Norzagaray (Bulacan) and Piers (Manila). Petitioner Fortunato Halili, an existing operator of "Halili Transit," opposed the application, arguing that he already served the line, that his service was adequate, and that granting the application would result in ruinous competition.

The PSC granted Cruz's application, finding that no existing operator provided direct service from Norzagaray to the Piers (most ended at Divisoria or Folgueras), and that there was a public need due to the volume of commuters and industries in the area. Halili petitioned for review, contending the findings were unsupported by evidence and that he was denied his right to protection as an old operator.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the PSC's finding of public necessity is supported by evidence.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to protection from competition as a prior operator.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the PSC, ruling that the Commission's factual findings are conclusive upon the Court as long as there is evidence reasonably supporting them. The record showed numerous daily commuters (students, professionals, and workers from industries like Republic Cement) and a shortage of transportation, forcing passengers to make "broken trips" or transfer vehicles to reach Manila [1, 2].

2. **NO.** While old operators are generally protected from ruinous competition, this principle yields to the primary consideration of public convenience (*Raymundo Transportation Co. v. Perez*). Public convenience is best served when passengers can proceed to their destination without changing buses, and Halili did not offer a direct line to the Piers [3, 4]. Furthermore, an old operator cannot complain if they have failed to place all authorized units in service (*Mirasol Transportation Co., Inc. v. Negros Travelways Corporation*). Evidence showed Halili was authorized for 48 trips but only performed two, proving he was unable to fully meet the public demand [4, 5].

The decision of the Public Service Commission is affirmed.
