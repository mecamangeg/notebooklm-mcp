I. CAPTION
TIBURCIO ALCOBER, APOLONIA ALCOBER and LUCIA ALCOBER v. HON. HONORATO GARCIANO, SATURNINO GARDON, et al., G.R. No. L-24665, May 23, 1968, 23 SCRA 675, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners (the Alcobers) were defendants in a civil case for annulment of title instituted by respondents (the Gardons) and intervenors (the Baseas) involving a parcel of land [1]. On February 17, 1965, the trial court rendered judgment against petitioners [2]. Petitioners filed their notice of appeal, and their appeal bond and record on appeal were approved by respondent Judge Garciano on April 3, 1965 [2].

Four days after the approval of the record on appeal, on April 7, 1965, the plaintiffs filed a motion for execution pending appeal [2]. Despite petitioners' opposition, Judge Garciano granted the motion on April 20, 1965, and subsequently denied petitioners' motion to stay execution and approval of a supersedeas bond [2, 3]. A writ of execution was issued, prompting petitioners to file this petition for certiorari to annul the order [3]. The Judge argued he retained jurisdiction because plaintiffs manifested their intention to file the motion before the record was approved, citing *Laurilla v. Uichangco* [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court had jurisdiction to issue an order of execution pending appeal after the record on appeal and appeal bond had already been approved.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court had lost jurisdiction over the case. Under Section 9, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, the trial court loses jurisdiction "upon the approval of the record on appeal and of the appeal bond" if filed in due time [6]. The only exceptions are to issue orders for the protection and preservation of rights *not* involved in the matter litigated by the appeal, to approve compromises, or to permit a pauper's appeal [6, 7].

Execution of judgment is a proceeding affecting the rights of the parties involving the matter litigated by the appeal and does not fall under the exceptions for mere preservation of the subject of litigation [8]. The Court distinguished this case from *Laurilla v. Uichangco*, noting that in *Laurilla*, the motion for execution was filed *before* the perfection of the appeal, making the approval of the record merely provisional [5]. Here, the motion was filed *after* the appeal was perfected; thus, the court had no power to order execution [4, 6].

The petition is granted, and the order of execution and the writ issued thereunder are declared null and void [9].
