I. CAPTION
**ANGEL JOSE WAREHOUSING CO., INC. v. CHELDA ENTERPRISES and DAVID SYJUECO**, G.R. No. L-25704, April 24, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Angel Jose Warehousing Co., Inc. filed a suit against Chelda Enterprises and its partner David Syjueco to recover alleged unpaid loans totaling P20,880.00 [1]. The defendants admitted obtaining loans totaling P26,500.00 but claimed that the plaintiff charged usurious interest rates of 2% and 2.5% per month [2]. Consequently, the defendants argued that the plaintiff had no cause of action because the loan was void due to the illegal consideration [2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila found that usurious interest had indeed been charged and deducted P1,048.15 from the unpaid principal [3]. However, the lower court ruled that the plaintiff could still collect the remaining principal balance of P19,247.35 plus legal interest and attorney's fees [3, 4]. The defendants appealed directly to the Supreme Court, arguing that the usurious nature of the loan rendered the entire contract void, precluding the recovery of the principal [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the creditor may recover the principal debt in a contract of loan tainted with usurious interest.
2. W/N the plaintiff is entitled to attorney’s fees.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that a contract of loan with usurious interest is valid as to the loan but void as to the usurious interest [6]. While Article 1411 of the Civil Code prohibits recovery when parties are in *pari delicto* regarding an illegal cause, a contract of loan with usurious interest consists of two divisible stipulations: the principal obligation to pay the debt and the accessory obligation to pay interest [7, 8]. Under Article 1420 of the Civil Code, in a divisible contract, if the illegal terms can be separated from the legal ones, the latter may be enforced [8]. Since the illegality lies only in the prestation to pay interest, the principal debt remains valid and recoverable [9]. To rule otherwise would unjustly enrich the borrower at the expense of the lender [10]. The principal earns legal interest from the date of judicial demand (filing of the complaint) under Article 2209 of the Civil Code, not based on stipulation, but as damages for delay [11].

2. **NO.** Attorney's fees are generally not recoverable in the absence of a stipulation [12]. The plaintiff's engagement of counsel due to the defendants' refusal to pay does not automatically justify such an award under Article 2208 of the Civil Code [12]. The Court noted that the defendants had a valid reason to resist the claim because the point of law regarding the recovery of the principal in usurious loans under the New Civil Code had not yet been definitely ruled upon [12].

The judgment was **MODIFIED**; the award of attorney’s fees was deleted, and the recoverable principal was corrected to P19,239.35 [13].
