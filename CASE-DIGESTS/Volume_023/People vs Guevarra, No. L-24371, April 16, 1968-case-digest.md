I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GUEVARRA, G.R. No. L-24371, April 16, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of November 12, 1959, in Naujan, Oriental Mindoro, appellant Constancio Guevarra, a policeman, was with fellow officers discussing rumors that Andres Papasin had blamed the police for the Mayor's election loss. Resentful of these remarks, Guevarra hid behind a tamarind tree near Papasin’s house, intending to ambush him. When Agapito Salazar, Papasin’s cousin, walked by, Guevarra mistook him for Papasin and shot him. Salazar was unarmed and died from the gunshot wound. Guevarra later signed an extrajudicial confession admitting the mistake (*aberratio ictus*) but argued self-defense and alibi at trial. The Court of First Instance found him guilty of murder qualified by treachery and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the crime committed is murder qualified by treachery despite the mistake in the victim's identity (*aberratio ictus*).
2. W/N evident premeditation constitutes an aggravating circumstance.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the purely accidental circumstance that a person other than the one intended was killed does not modify the nature of the crime nor lessen criminal responsibility. Treachery was properly appreciated because Guevarra hid behind a tree, ensuring the execution of the crime without risk to himself. The victim, unarmed and unaware, had no opportunity to defend himself. Citing *People v. Guillen*, the Court held that treachery applies even if the victim was not the intended target, provided neither the intended nor the actual victim could defend against the attack.

2. **NO.** The Court held that the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation cannot be appreciated where the deceased was not the intended victim.

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED**.
