I. CAPTION
LILIA DE JESUS-SEVILLA v. THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-20060, April 30, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In June 1954, petitioner Lilia de Jesus-Sevilla, a lawyer and businesswoman, was approached by Jes Cortes to promote the first bullfight exhibitions in the Philippines. As Cortes lacked funds, Sevilla agreed to raise the working capital [1]. On August 20, 1954, Sevilla executed a special power of attorney authorizing Cortes to contract with a Portuguese bullfight troupe [2]. On October 10, 1954, they entered into a "Contract of Management" designating Cortes as "Promoter" and Sevilla as "General Manager" [2]. Sevilla eventually provided P170,000.00 in capital [3]. Beyond financing, she actively managed the venture: she contracted Harry Lyons, Inc. to construct the arena, granted Tabacalera exclusive advertising rights, kept books of accounts, and managed disbursements and gate receipts [3-5].

The Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed Sevilla P111,056.84 for amusement tax as the proprietor/operator of the exhibitions [3]. Sevilla protested, arguing she was merely a financier and thus exempt under the ruling in *Blaquera v. Aldaba*. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the assessment, ruling she was more than a mere financier [6]. Sevilla appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner is liable for amusement tax as the proprietor or operator of the bullfight exhibitions.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's decision. Under Section 260 of the National Internal Revenue Code, the proprietor or operator is liable for amusement tax [6]. The Court rejected Sevilla's reliance on *Blaquera v. Aldaba*, distinguishing that in *Blaquera*, the financier's role was limited to lending funds [7].

In this case, Sevilla's participation went beyond mere financing. She assumed active involvement by contracting for the arena's construction, managing advertising rights, and handling the receipts and books of the business [5]. The "Contract of Management" labeling Cortes as "Promoter" did not exempt her; it was merely an arrangement to protect her capital investment [8]. Consequently, she is liable as a proprietor/operator.

**Judgment affirmed.**
