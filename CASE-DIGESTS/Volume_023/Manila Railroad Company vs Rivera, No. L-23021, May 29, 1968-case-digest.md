I. CAPTION
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. MARIANO RIVERA and the WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-23021, May 29, 1968, 23 SCRA 922, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Mariano Rivera was an employee of petitioner Manila Railroad Company (MRR). He was re-employed in 1958 and promoted to maintenance *capataz*. On January 13, 1961, a company chest X-ray revealed he was suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. In a memorandum dated June 8, 1961, MRR informed Rivera of his affliction and ordered him to stop working immediately. Rivera stopped working on June 16, 1961, and his service was officially terminated on July 31, 1961.

On October 10, 1961, Rivera filed a notice of injury and claim for compensation. MRR argued that Rivera was a temporary employee whose term had expired, and that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations for being filed beyond the two-month period prescribed by Section 24 of Act 3428. The Hearing Officer ruled in favor of Rivera, awarding compensation and P110.00 for medical expenses. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed the decision but increased the award. MRR petitioned the Supreme Court for review.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent was dismissed due to the expiration of his temporary appointment.
2. W/N the claim for compensation is barred by the failure to file notice within the prescribed period.
3. W/N the illness is compensable.
4. W/N the award for medical expenses is proper without receipts.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The termination was due to disability, not expiration of term. MRR’s own memorandum dated June 8, 1961, clearly stated Rivera was disqualified due to pulmonary tuberculosis [1]. Furthermore, Rivera’s appointment had already become permanent on August 16, 1960 [1].

2. **NO.** The failure to comply with the notice requirement in Section 24 of Act 3428 is non-jurisdictional and does not bar the proceedings if the employer had knowledge of the illness [2]. MRR had knowledge of Rivera's illness as early as January 1961 through its company physician [3]. Failure to controvert the claim within the statutory period constituted a waiver of the right to do so [3].

3. **YES.** Since the illness occurred during employment, there is a rebuttable presumption that it arose out of or was aggravated by such employment [4]. The burden to overthrow this presumption lies with the employer, which MRR failed to do. Findings of fact by the WCC are binding on the Court when supported by substantial evidence [5].

4. **NO.** The award for P110.00 in medical expenses must be disallowed. The expenses were not supported by receipts, and the attending physician was not presented to substantiate the claim [6].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision appealed from is hereby **AFFIRMED**, with the **MODIFICATION** that the award for medical expenses is disallowed.
