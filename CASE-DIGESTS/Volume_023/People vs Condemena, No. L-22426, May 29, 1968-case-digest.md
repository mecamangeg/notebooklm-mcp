I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PELAGIO CONDEMENA, CASAMERO PATIÑO, SIMPLICIO ANIEL, and RICARIDO CAUSING, G.R. No. L-22426, May 29, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On October 6, 1962, at around 6:00 PM, four men entered the house of Fermin and Barcelisa Lamoste in Villaba, Leyte. Barcelisa recognized her neighbor, Pelagio Condemena, and later identified his companions as Casamero Patiño, Ricarido Causing, and appellant Simplicio Aniel. While Aniel pointed a gun at Barcelisa and warned her not to shout, the other three overpowered and stabbed her husband Fermin, causing his death. The group then took P200.00 from the couple's trunk and fled. The Court of First Instance of Leyte convicted all four accused of robbery in band with homicide and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua*. The trial court appreciated the mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction but did not rule on the alleged aggravating circumstances. Condemena, Patiño, and Causing withdrew their appeals. Aniel continued his appeal, claiming alibi (that he was selling fish in another town) and challenging the credibility of his identification.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over the positive identification of the accused.
2. W/N the appellant is liable for the homicide even if he did not physically participate in the killing.
3. W/N lack of instruction constitutes a mitigating circumstance in robbery cases.
4. W/N nocturnity constitutes an aggravating circumstance in this case.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Alibi is a weak defense where prosecution witnesses positively identify the accused. The widow "unhesitantly and unmistakenly" identified Aniel as the one who held her at gunpoint. Additionally, the extrajudicial confessions of the co-accused, which were independently made and identical in essential details, were admissible as circumstantial evidence of Aniel's participation (*People v. Lumahang*).

2. **YES.** Conspiracy was evident from the accused's collective acts demonstrating a common design. Under Article 296 of the Revised Penal Code, any member of a band is punished as a principal for any assault committed by the band, unless it is shown that he attempted to prevent it. Aniel failed to prevent the assault and instead facilitated the crime by guarding the wife (*People v. Garduque*).

3. **NO.** Lack of instruction and education does not constitute a mitigating circumstance where the crime charged is theft or robbery, although it may be considered in homicide cases (*People v. Melendrez*). The trial court erred in mitigating the liability based on this ground.

4. **NO.** The aggravating circumstance of nocturnity cannot be appreciated because the record failed to show that the peculiar advantages of nighttime were purposely and deliberately sought by the accused to ensure impunity (*People v. Boyles*). However, the Court noted that the aggravating circumstances of dwelling and abuse of superior strength should have been appreciated.

Decision affirmed.
