I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS, PIO NERIA v. THE COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION**, G.R. No. L-24800, May 27, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pio Neria arrived in Manila on July 9, 1961, claiming Filipino citizenship. The Board of Special Inquiry (BSI) No. 1 investigated his case and, on August 2, 1961, unanimously voted to admit him as a Filipino citizen, rendering a written decision to that effect [1, 2]. Neria’s counsel received a copy of this decision on September 4, 1961 [1].

Pursuant to a Department of Justice directive, the new Board of Commissioners (BOC) reviewed Neria’s case *motu proprio* [3]. The BOC issued a decision reversing the BSI findings and ordering Neria's exclusion; this decision was dated August 2, 1962 [3, 4]. However, the minutes of the BOC meeting revealed that the Board actually deliberated and voted on the case on August 8, 1962 [4].

On April 23, 1965, Neria was arrested by immigration agents [5]. He filed a petition for habeas corpus, arguing the BOC decision was void for lack of jurisdiction [6, 7]. The Court of First Instance granted the writ and ordered his release, ruling that the BOC’s power to review had prescribed [8]. The Commissioner appealed, contending the one-year review period began from the receipt of notice (September 4) and that Neria failed to exhaust administrative remedies [9, 10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Board of Commissioners acted within its jurisdiction to review the BSI decision *motu proprio* within the one-year prescriptive period.
2. W/N the petition was premature due to failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Board of Commissioners acted beyond its jurisdiction. Section 27(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 613 provides that the BSI decision becomes final unless reversed by the BOC within one year from "promulgation" [11]. The Court held that "promulgation" in this context refers to the date the BSI voted and resolved to admit the alien, which was **August 2, 1961** [2, 12]. It rejected the argument that promulgation occurs upon notice to the party (September 4, 1961), noting that under Immigration Rules, an alien may be released immediately upon a favorable vote, implying promulgation precedes the written notice [13].

Computed from August 2, 1961, the one-year period expired on August 2, 1962 [4]. Although the BOC decision was dated August 2, 1962, the evidence showed the Board actually deliberated and resolved the case on **August 8, 1962** [4, 14]. Since the reversal was made after the lapse of the one-year period, the BOC had lost jurisdiction, and the BSI decision admitting Neria had already become final [14].

2. **NO.** The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is inapplicable when the question in dispute is purely legal or when the controverted act is patently illegal or performed without jurisdiction [10]. The issues here—the legal definition of "promulgation" and the validity of the BOC's jurisdiction based on the date of its actual resolution—are questions of law [15].

**Decision affirmed.**
