I. CAPTION
ENCARNACION TEVES v. THE PEOPLE’S HOMESITE AND HOUSING CORPORATION, MELISENDA L. SANTOS, and CESAR L. SANTOS, G.R. No. L-21498, June 27, 1968, 23 SCRA 1142, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Since October 1950, Encarnacion Teves and her husband occupied Lot 9, Block K-70 of the Diliman Estate (Quezon Memorial Grove) [1, 2]. PHHC Resolution No. 21 (Fiscal Year 1951-52) granted occupants the preferential right to purchase lots in the subdivision [2, 3]. After her husband's death in 1957, Teves applied to purchase the lot in her own name [4]. However, PHHC officials allegedly ignored her application and, in violation of the preferential policy, sold the lot to Melisenda L. Santos in 1962, executing a deed of sale and issuing a title in Santos' name [3, 5]. Teves filed a complaint to annul the sale and title, alleging fraud and violation of her preferential rights [6, 7]. The lower court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, ruling that because Teves was not a party to the deed of sale between PHHC and Santos, she could not maintain an action to annul it [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a plaintiff who is not a party to a contract of sale has a cause of action to annul said contract.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while Article 1397 of the Civil Code generally restricts the action for annulment to those principally or subsidiarily obliged in the contract, a person who is not a party may exercise an action for nullity if they are prejudiced in their rights with respect to one of the contracting parties and can show the detriment which would positively result to them from the contract [9-11]. The Court relied on the doctrine in *Ibañez v. Hongkong & Shanghai Bank* (22 Phil. 572) [11].

The complaint sufficiently alleged that Teves acquired a preferential right to buy the lot under PHHC policy as a prior occupant, similar to the rights recognized in *Huerta v. Acosta* [12, 13]. The sale to Santos violated this right and the Civil Code provisions on human relations (Articles 19, 21, and 24), causing Teves distinct injury [14]. Consequently, she has standing to sue.

The Order appealed from is **SET ASIDE**, and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [15].
