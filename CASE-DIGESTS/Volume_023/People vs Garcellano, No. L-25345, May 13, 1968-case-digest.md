I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROMULO GARCELLANO and OSCAR SEDANO, G.R. No. L-25345, May 13, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On November 13, 1960, in Iguig, Cagayan, Basilio Rey attended a party at the house of Manuel Sedano. A heated discussion arose between Basilio and Manuel regarding Basilio's sale of land belonging to his former common-law wife, Raymunda Garcellano (sister of appellant Romulo Garcellano). During the altercation, Romulo held Basilio while Manuel clubbed him with bamboo, and appellant Oscar Sedano stabbed him. Basilio managed to escape but was chased by the group and further stabbed by Pedro Sedano (deceased). Basilio sustained eight wounds and died.

Romulo surrendered and admitted killing Basilio but claimed self-defense and defense of the honor of his sister, Florfina, alleging Basilio attempted to assault her. Oscar Sedano claimed alibi. The Court of First Instance of Cagayan convicted them of Murder and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Romulo Garcellano validly claimed self-defense and defense of a relative.
2. W/N Oscar Sedano's defense of alibi is valid.
3. W/N the crime committed is Murder.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Romulo Garcellano failed to prove his defense. Having admitted the killing, the burden shifted to him to establish his defense by clear and convincing evidence [1]. His claim that he defended his sister Florfina from sexual assault was uncorroborated and incredible, given that the room was occupied by others and lit by a lamp [2]. Furthermore, Florfina herself testified that no such assault occurred and positively identified the appellants as the attackers [3].

2. **NO.** The defense of alibi cannot stand in the face of positive identification. Florfina Garcellano, who knew Oscar Sedano personally, positively identified him as one of the individuals who stabbed the victim [4].

3. **NO.** The crime committed is **Homicide**, not Murder. The Supreme Court found insufficient evidence to establish conspiracy or evidentiary premeditation. The attack was spontaneous, resulting from the heat of the discussion between the victim and Manuel Sedano [5, 6]. Consequently, the decision was modified. Romulo Garcellano was granted the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender [7]. Both appellants were found guilty of Homicide [5].
