I. CAPTION
STA. CECILIA SAWMILLS, INC. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and TAGKAWAYAN LABOR UNION, G.R. Nos. L-19273-74, May 26, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
This resolves a Motion for Reconsideration filed by respondent Tagkawayan Labor Union against a Supreme Court decision which awarded its members three months' wages [1], [2]. The Union argued that the workers should have been reinstated and allowed to continue working rather than receiving limited back pay, contending that there was no evidence submitted at trial regarding the alleged closing of Sta. Cecilia Sawmills, Inc. [2]. The Court noted that the lack of evidence regarding the mill's closure at the trial stage was due to the fact that the issue then was limited to whether the workers' removal was valid under a closed-shop agreement with the National Labor Union [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the award of three months' back pay in lieu of reinstatement is proper given the closing of the petitioner's sawmills.

IV. RULING
**YES.** A judgment for the reinstatement of illegally dismissed laborers may be modified to three months' back pay when it appears that losses in the company's business justified the closing of its sawmills, thereby rendering reinstatement an impossibility [3], [4]. The Court held that while the closing of the mills was not the issue during the initial trial, the subsequent confirmation of business losses and closure makes actual reinstatement impossible, justifying the modification of the relief to back pay only [3], [2]. The Motion for Reconsideration was denied [5].
