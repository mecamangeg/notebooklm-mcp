I. CAPTION
MATEO DE RAMAS v. THE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS and GERONIMO B. RAMOS, G.R. No. L-19555, May 29, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Geronimo B. Ramos was the tenant of petitioner Mateo de Ramas on a 2.5-hectare land in Cavite under a verbal share tenancy contract with a 70-30 sharing basis [1]. On June 22, 1960, Ramos informed De Ramas of his desire to change their system from share tenancy to leasehold tenancy pursuant to Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199 (Agricultural Tenancy Act) [1]. De Ramas refused, insisting on their existing agreement. Ramos filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) [1].

During the proceedings, Ramos moved to suspend the case because the constitutionality of Section 14 was being challenged in a separate case pending before the Supreme Court (*Juliano v. CAR*), but the CAR denied the motion [2]. The CAR eventually rendered judgment upholding the constitutionality of Section 14 and allowing the change to leasehold [3]. De Ramas filed a petition for certiorari with prohibition, arguing that the CAR should have suspended proceedings and attacking Section 14 for impairing the obligation of contracts [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CAR erred in proceeding with the case despite a pending constitutional challenge to the law in the Supreme Court.
2. W/N Section 14 of R.A. No. 1199 is unconstitutional for impairing the obligation of contracts.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The mere fact that the constitutionality of a law is raised in another case pending in the Supreme Court is not a valid reason for suspending proceedings. Laws are considered valid until declared unconstitutional, and until then, courts are duty-bound to enforce them [5].

2. **NO.** Section 14 of R.A. No. 1199 is constitutional and valid [6]. The provision is justified by the Constitutional directive to do justice to labor (Art. II, Sec. 5) and the State's duty to regulate relations between landowner and tenant (Art. XIV, Sec. 6) [4, 7]. While Section 14 allows the tenant to change the contract from share to leasehold, obligations of contracts must yield to the proper exercise of the police power of the State [8, 9]. The law aims to improve the lot of the tenant class and insure the internal security of the country; thus, the right granted to the tenant is not unreasonable or oppressive [7, 10].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Bengzon, C.J., concurring:**
Concurred in the result without voting on the constitutional question. He noted that the tenancy relationship began in 1958 or 1959 when R.A. No. 1199 was already in force; therefore, the law was deemed part of their contract, and the landowner cannot complain of impairment [6].
