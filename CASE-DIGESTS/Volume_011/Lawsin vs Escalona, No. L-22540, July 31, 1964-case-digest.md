I. CAPTION
BARTOLOME LAWSIN v. HON. GODOFREDO ESCALONA and VIRGINIO A. ASTILLA, G.R. No. L-22540, July 31, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Bartolome Lawsin and Respondent Virginio Astilla were candidates for councilor in Tacloban City during the November 12, 1963 elections. Astilla filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte alleging that the Board of Election Inspectors of Precinct 65 erroneously credited Lawsin with 75 votes in the election returns, whereas the tally board and certificate of votes showed he only received 65 votes. Astilla prayed for a judicial recount. Lawsin opposed, arguing that a discrepancy between returns and the tally board is not a ground for recount and that Astilla had previously filed a petition for correction of returns based on the same facts, which was dismissed. Respondent Judge Escalona granted the recount and enjoined Lawsin's proclamation. Lawsin filed a petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a discrepancy between the election returns and the tally board or tally sheet is a valid ground for a judicial recount under the Revised Election Code.
2. W/N the respondent is guilty of splitting a cause of action by filing separate suits for correction of returns and for recount.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A judicial recount under Sections 163 and 168 of the Revised Election Code is a special authority that must be restrictively construed. The law authorizes a recount only in case of contradictions or discrepancies between "copies of the same statements" (the election returns) submitted to the board of canvassers. A tally sheet or tally board is not an authentic copy of the election return. Furthermore, the Commission on Elections cannot expand the scope of the Election Code via its instructions to inspectors to include tally sheets as grounds for a recount.

2. **YES.** The respondent was guilty of splitting a single cause of action. The operative facts (the alleged discrepancy between the tally sheet and the returns) were identical in both his petition for correction of returns and his petition for recount. Under the Rules of Court, a party cannot make the same cause of action the subject of two suits. The judgment in the correction case serves as a bar to the subsequent suit for recount.

The lower court's order for recount and injunction against the proclamation are **REVOKED** and **SET ASIDE**, and the Supreme Court's preliminary injunction is made **PERMANENT**.
