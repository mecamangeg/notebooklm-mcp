I. CAPTION
CHUNG QUIAO alias BINA TAN v. ANITA ABADAY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20315, June 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Anita Abaday and Juanita Isoy filed claims for underpayment of wages, overtime pay, and separation pay against petitioner Chung Quiao before the Department of Labor regional office in Cagayan de Oro City [1]. Chung Quiao failed to answer and was declared in default. The hearing officer rendered decisions ordering Chung Quiao to pay Abaday P2,042.30 and Isoy P529.00, and subsequently issued a writ of execution [1].

Chung Quiao filed a petition for injunction with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Misamis Oriental to stop the execution. The CFI ruled in favor of Chung Quiao, declaring the hearing officer’s decisions unenforceable and making the injunction permanent [1]. The lower court held that under Republic Act No. 602, the power to adjudicate wage recovery claims belongs to courts of justice, not labor hearing officers [2]. Respondents appealed, arguing that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A conferred original and exclusive jurisdiction over money claims to regional labor offices [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the hearing officer of the Department of Labor has jurisdiction to adjudicate money claims and enforce them via writ of execution under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that the hearing officer lacked jurisdiction. The Court reiterated settled jurisprudence established in *Miller v. Mardo*, *Stoll v. Mardo*, and *Davao Far Eastern Commercial Co. v. Montemayor*, holding that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is unconstitutional insofar as it confers judicial powers upon labor officials to pass upon labor claims (other than those under the Workmen's Compensation Commission) [4].

The Court explained that this grant of jurisdiction constitutes an undue delegation of legislative power not contemplated by Republic Act No. 997. Since the grant of power was invalid, the decisions rendered by the hearing officer were legally ineffective and could not be enforced by a writ of execution [5, 6].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [6].
