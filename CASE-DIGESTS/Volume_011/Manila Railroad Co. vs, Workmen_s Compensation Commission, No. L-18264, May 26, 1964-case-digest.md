I. CAPTION
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and PERPETUA BINOSA, No. L-18264, May 26, 1964, 11 SCRA 305, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Jesus Binosa was employed as a temporary bus driver for petitioner Manila Railroad Company from April to October 1957. On September 22, 1958, eleven months after he stopped working, he died of pulmonary tuberculosis [1]. On January 22, 1959—more than three months after his death—his widow, respondent Perpetua Binosa, filed a notice and claim for death benefits [1]. The Regional Administrator denied this claim on August 6, 1959, finding no causal link between the illness and employment, and the case was considered closed when no additional evidence was submitted [1, 2]. However, on November 3, 1959, Perpetua filed a formal complaint for compensation [2]. Petitioner filed an answer raising the defense that the claim had prescribed under Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 3428) [2]. The hearing officer awarded compensation, which was affirmed by the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC). The WCC ruled that although the claim was late, the petitioner's failure to seasonably controvert the original claim cured the defect [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the WCC has jurisdiction to grant a compensation claim filed more than three months after the employee's death.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the WCC's decision. Section 24 of Act No. 3428 mandates that a claim for compensation in case of death must be made not later than three months after death [4]. This requirement is a condition precedent of jurisdictional import; non-compliance bars the recovery of compensation [5, 6]. The Court held that the WCC erred in ruling that the employer's failure to controvert cured the late filing [7]. Moreover, the petitioner's failure to controvert the first claim did not operate to its prejudice because that claim had already been denied and closed by the Regional Administrator [7]. Regarding the formal complaint filed on November 3, 1959, the petitioner had filed a timely answer disclaiming liability and raising the jurisdictional defect [7].

The decision and resolution of the Workmen's Compensation Commission are reversed and set aside [8].
