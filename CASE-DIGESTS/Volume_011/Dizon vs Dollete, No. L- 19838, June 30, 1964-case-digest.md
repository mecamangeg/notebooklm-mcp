I. CAPTION
PEDRO R. DIZON and OLIMPIO MANALANG v. HON. JUDGE AMBROSIO T. DOLLETE and ARTEMIO SALDAÑA, G.R. No. L-19838, June 30, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Fermin Adraneda, a policeman of Samal, Bataan, was charged in court with frustrated homicide [1]. Bataan Provincial Governor Pedro Dizon (Petitioner) directed Samal Mayor Artemio Saldaña (Respondent) to suspend Adraneda pursuant to Section 4 of Republic Act No. 557, which mandates the suspension of police officers charged with felonies [1]. Mayor Saldaña refused to comply despite repeated demands and warnings from the Governor [1, 2].

Consequently, Governor Dizon filed administrative charges against Mayor Saldaña with the Provincial Board for neglect of duty and violation of law [2]. Pursuantly, the Governor issued Executive Order No. 1 suspending Mayor Saldaña from office for 30 days [2]. Mayor Saldaña filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of First Instance of Bataan [3]. Respondent Judge Dollete issued an order enjoining the Governor from enforcing the suspension, ruling that the Mayor's refusal did not constitute an act affecting his "official integrity" under Section 2188 of the Revised Administrative Code [3, 4]. Governor Dizon filed this petition for certiorari to set aside the lower court's orders [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Provincial Governor has the power to suspend a Municipal Mayor for the latter's refusal to suspend a policeman charged in court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the suspension of a municipal policeman charged in court is mandatory under Section 4 of Republic Act No. 557, which provides that the mayor "shall immediately suspend the accused" [6, 7]. The law leaves no room for discretion [7].

Mayor Saldaña's adamant refusal to suspend the policeman, despite the Governor's orders and the clear mandate of the law, amounted to "neglect of duty" and a violation of law [8]. The Court ruled that these acts affect the Mayor's "official integrity," defining the term to include "not only soundness of moral principle and character but also... strictness or fidelity in the discharge of the trust reposed, like obedience to the laws, legal orders and decrees" [8]. Since the charges involved neglect of duty and affected official integrity, the Provincial Governor was empowered under Section 2188 of the Revised Administrative Code to suspend the Mayor pending action by the Provincial Board [9, 10].

The orders of the lower court were set aside, Executive Order No. 1 suspending Mayor Saldaña was declared legal, and the writ of preliminary injunction was made permanent [11].
