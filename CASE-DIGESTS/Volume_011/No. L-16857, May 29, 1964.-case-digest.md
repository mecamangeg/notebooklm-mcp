I. CAPTION
MARCELO CASTILLO, JR., et al. v. MACARIA PASCO, G.R. No. L-16857, May 29, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In October 1931, Marcelo Castillo, Sr., a widower, married Macaria Pasco, a widow. On December 22, 1932, during their marriage, they purchased a fishpond in Bulacan for P6,000, payable in three installments. The first installment of P1,000 was paid using Macaria's exclusive funds (P600 from a debt owed to her and P400 from the sale of her private land). The second installment (P2,000) was paid via a loan from Dr. Nicanor Jacinto, and the third (P3,000) via a loan secured by a mortgage on Macaria’s paraphernal lands. Both spouses were signatories to these loans.

Castillo, Sr. died in 1933. Macaria subsequently paid the loans using her own funds. The petitioners, children and grandchildren of Castillo, Sr. from his first marriage, filed a complaint for partition and accounting, claiming the fishpond was conjugal property. The Court of Appeals affirmed the Court of First Instance’s dismissal of the complaint, ruling that the property was exclusively paraphernal because Macaria had the financial means while Castillo, Sr. did not, and the loans were secured by her properties.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the fishpond acquired during marriage is entirely the paraphernal property of the wife.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. Under the Spanish Civil Code of 1889 (the law applicable in 1932), property acquired for onerous consideration during marriage is deemed conjugal or separate depending on the source of the funds used (Arts. 1396 and 1401).

While the first installment of P1,000 was clearly paid with the wife's exclusive funds, the remaining P5,000 was derived from loans granted to **both** spouses as joint borrowers. The Court applied the doctrine in *Palanca v. Smith Bell & Co.*, holding that money borrowed by the spouses—even if secured by the wife's paraphernal property—becomes an obligation of the conjugal partnership and constitutes conjugal funds. The mortgage is merely an accessory obligation and does not alter the character of the loan as a partnership debt. This is distinguished from *Lim Queco v. Cartagena*, where the wife borrowed money alone.

Consequently, the fishpond belongs to both patrimonies in common: an undivided one-sixth (1/6) is paraphernal (Macaria's share), and five-sixths (5/6) is conjugal partnership property. Macaria’s payment of the loans after her husband's death does not increase her ownership share but only creates a lien in her favor for reimbursement.

The dismissal of the complaint was **REVOKED** and the records were **REMANDED** to the court of origin for partition and accounting.
