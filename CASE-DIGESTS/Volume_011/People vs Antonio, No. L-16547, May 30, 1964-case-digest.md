I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MODESTO ANTONIO and BONIFACIO TOLETE, G.R. No. L-16547, May 30, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On April 13, 1955, in Isabela, Porfirio Gabiran, a watchman for the local waterworks system, was shot and killed by appellant Modesto Antonio [1, 2]. Antonio, a sawmill operator, was riding in a truck driven by co-appellant Bonifacio Tolete when he shot Gabiran with a .22 caliber rifle following a previous altercation regarding the truck's passage over a canal the victim was digging [3, 4]. Antonio ordered his employees, including prosecution witnesses Prudencio Pascua and Francisco Sulio, to dig a grave and bury the victim [3]. He threatened to kill them and their families if they revealed the crime [3]. Tolete assisted in burying the body and later, in March 1956, exhumed and disposed of the bones in a river [3, 5, 6].

The witnesses kept silent for over a year due to fear of Antonio's threats but eventually reported the crime to the Constabulary on August 2, 1956 [2, 7]. An investigation led to the recovery of small bones and personal effects identified by the victim's widow [8]. The Court of First Instance of Isabela convicted Antonio of murder as principal and Tolete as an accessory after the fact [9]. They appealed, questioning the credibility of the witnesses due to their long silence [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the witnesses' delay of more than one year in reporting the crime destroys their credibility.
2. W/N the guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the delay was sufficiently explained by the witnesses' fear to reveal what they knew because of the death threats uttered by the appellants and their desire not to be implicated in the crime [7, 10]. There was no evidence that the witnesses, who were employees of the accused, fabricated the story to cause a false indictment against those from whom they received benefits [7].

2. **YES.** The appellants' denial cannot prevail over the positive testimony of witnesses who were not only present at the killing but also cooperated in hiding the crime by compulsion [10, 11]. The Court found the witnesses' testimony credible and supported by physical evidence, such as the recovered personal effects of the deceased [8, 11].

Judgment affirmed.
