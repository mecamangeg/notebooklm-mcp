I. CAPTION
**PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. JOSE F. MONROY, doing business under the Trade Name and Style of "AVENUE ICE DROP FACTORY"**, G.R. No. L-19374, June 30, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In March 1961, the Philippine National Bank (PNB) filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to revive a judgment rendered by the same court in May 1949. The 1949 judgment ordered Jose F. Monroy to pay PNB the sum of P12,000.00 with interest, attorney’s fees, and costs. Monroy failed to answer the 1961 complaint and was declared in default. PNB presented its evidence. However, the CFI dismissed the action *motu proprio*, ruling that the action had already prescribed because more than ten years had elapsed between the rendition of the judgment in May 1949 and the filing of the action for revival in March 1961. PNB appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action to enforce the judgment has prescribed based on the date the judgment was rendered.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the lower court erred in computing the prescriptive period from the date the judgment was *rendered*. Under Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court and settled jurisprudence (*Phil. Nat. Bank vs. Silo*), the ten-year period of prescription for an action to enforce a judgment is counted from the day the judgment *became final*, not from the date it was rendered. Since the complaint did not allege the date of finality, the trial court could not validly conclude that the action had prescribed merely because ten years had passed since the judgment's rendition.

**Judgment reversed.**
