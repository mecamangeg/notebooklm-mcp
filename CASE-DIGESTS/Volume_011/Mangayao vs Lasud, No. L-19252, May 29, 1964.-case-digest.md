I. CAPTION
TUMIPUS MANGAYAO, ET AL. v. QUINTANA LASUD, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19252, May 29, 1964, 11 SCRA 158, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellees Tumipus Mangayao and Guimanda Bubungan are illiterate non-Christian Subanos [1]. They filed an action to recover a 14-hectare parcel of land in Zamboanga del Sur from defendants-appellants Quintana and Santay Lasud, who are literate [1]. Plaintiffs alleged they were deceived into signing a deed of absolute sale (Annex "A") believing it was a mortgage for a P5,000.00 loan [2, 3]. The parties stipulated that while the deed was approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, it lacked the approval of the Provincial Governor of Zamboanga del Sur or the Commissioner of Mindanao and Sulu [4]. The Court of First Instance declared the deed null and void *ab initio* for lack of executive approval required by the Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu and the Public Land Law [5]. Defendants appealed, arguing the contract was merely voidable and that the Civil Code supersedes the special laws [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the deed of sale executed by illiterate non-Christian Subanos is void *ab initio* for lack of approval by the competent executive authority.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. Section 145(b) of the Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu requires the approval of the provincial governor for conveyances of real property by non-Christians, and Section 146 expressly declares violations "null and void" [8]. Similarly, Section 120 of the Public Land Act (Commonwealth Act No. 141) states that conveyances by illiterate non-Christians "shall not be valid" unless approved by the Commissioner of Mindanao and Sulu [8].

The Court held that these provisions mean such contracts are void *ab initio*, not merely voidable [9]. Executive approval is an essential requisite for validity, not a mere ratification [9]. The Civil Code governing voidable contracts of incompetents does not supersede these special laws, which are based on public policy to protect illiterate non-Christians [7, 10]. Furthermore, the approval by the Secretary of Agriculture under Section 118 of the Public Land Act is a general requirement that cannot replace the specific approval required for illiterate non-Christians [7]. The defense of *in pari delicto* (parties at fault) was rejected because it does not apply where one party is literate and the other is not; Art. 1416 of the Civil Code allows recovery if public policy is enhanced [11].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [12].
