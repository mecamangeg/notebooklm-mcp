**I. CAPTION**
**GUILLERMO ANTONIO IVANOVICH v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-15998, May 26, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.**

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Guillermo Antonio Ivanovich, an applicant for naturalization, was serving the two-year probationary period required by law. He filed a petition with the lower court to leave the Philippines to tour Europe and the Americas as the Executive Vice President and General Manager of Fieldmen's Insurance Company, Inc. [1]. The court denied this request on July 6, 1957, citing the prohibition under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 530 [1]. Despite the denial, Ivanovich wrote to the Solicitor General insisting on the trip to establish reinsurance contacts, even at the risk of his application [1]. He left the Philippines on August 6, 1957, and returned on October 2, 1957 [2]. When his petition to take the oath of citizenship was heard, he claimed he left at the instance of the government, presenting a letter from the President [3, 4]. The lower court denied his petition to take the oath due to his unauthorized absence [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner's travel abroad for business purposes during the two-year probationary period constitutes a violation of R.A. No. 530 barring his admission to citizenship.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of the lower court. **Republic Act No. 530** strictly requires that during the two-year probationary period, an applicant for citizenship must not leave the Philippines [2]. The Court held that Ivanovich's absence for almost three months constituted a violation of this statute, which deprives an applicant of citizenship [5, 6]. The Court rejected his defense that the trip was at the instance of the government, noting that the evidence showed the trip was principally for the benefit of his insurance company [3, 7]. Furthermore, the President's letter he relied upon explicitly stated the trip would be at his own expense, and the formal appointment mentioned therein was never extended [4, 7].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Paredes, Dizon, and Makalintal concurred; Justices Labrador, Barrera, and Regala took no part).
