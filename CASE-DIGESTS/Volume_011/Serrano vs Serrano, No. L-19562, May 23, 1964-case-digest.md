I. CAPTION
JOSE SERRANO v. LUIS SERRANO, MARCELINO MONTANTE and HON. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-19562, May 23, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Luis Serrano and Marcelino Montante filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) alleging that petitioner Jose Serrano hired them to construct an apartment house in Manila. They claimed they worked 12 hours a day without receiving basic wages or overtime pay, were illegally dismissed, and refused reinstatement. They prayed for payment and reinstatement.

Petitioner denied the employer-employee relationship and challenged the CIR's jurisdiction, arguing the case was a mere money claim because the construction was already completed, making reinstatement impossible. He also moved to dismiss the case. The CIR deferred the resolution of the motion to dismiss and ordered the parties to present evidence. After petitioner failed to appear at subsequent hearings and walked out of one, the CIR deemed the case submitted for resolution. The CIR ruled in favor of respondents, awarding wages and overtime, though it did not order reinstatement as the house was finished. The CIR en banc affirmed the order. Petitioner appealed, claiming lack of jurisdiction and denial of due process.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over the claims for unpaid wages and overtime despite the project being completed.
2. W/N the petitioner was denied due process when the court decided the case without first ruling on his motion to dismiss.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The jurisdiction of a court over the subject matter is determined by the allegations of the complaint, not by the validity of the claims or the actual ability to grant the relief. The respondents' petition expressly prayed for reinstatement alongside overtime compensation. The Supreme Court held that the CIR has jurisdiction over claims for overtime compensation when coupled with a prayer for reinstatement, and the satisfaction of unpaid wages may be ordered incidentally to said jurisdiction. The fact that reinstatement was subsequently found to be impossible because the house was completed does not divest the court of the jurisdiction conferred by the allegations in the petition. The Court cited *Gomez vs. North Camarines Lumber Co., Inc.* in support of this principle.

2. **NO.** A court has ample discretion to defer action upon a motion to dismiss until after the parties have introduced all their evidence and submitted the case for decision on the merits. The record showed that the petitioner was afforded sufficient time and opportunity to adduce evidence but failed to appear at scheduled hearings or explicitly declined to present further evidence. The Court found no abuse of discretion, noting that petitioner's behavior indicated a waiver of his right to present additional evidence.

The Order of the Court of Industrial Relations is affirmed.
