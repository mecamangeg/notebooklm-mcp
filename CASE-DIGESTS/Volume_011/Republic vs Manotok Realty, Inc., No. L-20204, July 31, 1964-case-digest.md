I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MANOTOK REALTY, INC., G.R. No. L-20204, July 31, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On May 30, 1960, the Land Tenure Administration (LTA) filed a complaint to expropriate several contiguous parcels of land belonging to Manotok Realty, Inc., aggregating to about seven (7) hectares [1]. The expropriation was initiated under Republic Act No. 2342, which authorized the expropriation of lands in Manila and suburbs that were formerly part of landed estates or haciendas, provided they had been leased to tenants for at least ten years and had at least fifty houses erected thereon [2]. The purpose was to subdivide the land for resale to its tenants [1].

Manotok Realty moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that the seven-hectare area did not constitute a "landed estate" subject to expropriation under the Constitution and established jurisprudence (e.g., *Guido v. Rural Progress Administration*) [1]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the case, ruling that based on *stare decisis*, the power to expropriate for resale is limited to landed estates, and the subject property—having been subdivided from a larger 28-hectare estate—was no longer subject to such expropriation [3]. The Republic and the intervenor tenants' association appealed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the seven-hectare parcel of land may be validly expropriated by the government for resale to tenants under Republic Act No. 2342.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint. The Court held that for the purpose of determining whether a piece of land is a "landed estate" within the meaning of the Constitution (authorizing expropriation for subdivision and resale), its area or extension must be taken into account, not necessarily the number of tenants [5], [6].

While Republic Act No. 2342 attempted to authorize the expropriation of lands that "formerly formed part" of landed estates, the Court ruled that the Legislature cannot, by legislative fiat, declare a small parcel of land (such as the 7 hectares in question) to be a landed estate simply because at some time in the past it had formed part of one [7], [4]. Even if the original 28-hectare property was a landed estate, once it was partitioned, the resulting seven-hectare portion lost that character [4]. Consequently, the expropriation was deemed inappropriate and outside the constitutional purview [6].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [8], [6].
