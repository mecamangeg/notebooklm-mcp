I. CAPTION
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LAZARO MANGAWANG, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18861, June 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Gavino Amposta successfully obtained two original certificates of title over the same parcel of land (Lot No. 1633) in Bataan: OCT No. 100 issued in 1920 based on a Homestead Patent, and OCT No. 2668 issued in 1924 based on cadastral proceedings [1, 2].

On November 24, 1941, Amposta sold the land to Santos Camacho, surrendering the homestead title (OCT 100). This sale was registered, and TCT No. 5506 was issued to Santos. The property was eventually sold to Bonifacio Camacho, who mortgaged it to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP). Upon foreclosure, DBP acquired the property and obtained TCT No. 6961 in 1957 [2].

Meanwhile, on June 11, 1947, Amposta sold the same land to Lazaro and Arsenio Mangawang, this time surrendering the cadastral title (OCT 2668). The Mangawangs registered the sale in 1948 and obtained TCT No. 1098 [3, 4].

DBP sued to recover possession. The Court of First Instance of Bataan ruled in favor of the Mangawang brothers, holding that their title derived from a cadastral (judicial) proceeding was superior to DBP's title derived from an administrative homestead patent [4, 5]. DBP appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the DBP (the first registrant) has a better right to the land than the Mangawang brothers.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s decision. The Court held that while the two original titles were issued under different proceedings (Homestead vs. Cadastral), they were issued to the *same* person, Amposta. He could not validly utilize both [6, 7].

The case is treated as a double sale under Article 1473 of the Old Civil Code (now Article 1544 of the New Civil Code) [8]. Where the same land is sold to two different persons who are unaware of the flaw in the title, the law adjudicates the property to the purchaser who first registers the transaction in the Registry of Property.

DBP’s predecessor-in-interest (Santos Camacho) purchased and registered the land in 1941. The Mangawang brothers purchased the land in 1947 and registered it in 1948. Since the sale to Camacho was registered first in good faith, it is the valid one. When Amposta subsequently sold the land to the Mangawangs, he had nothing left to sell, making that transaction legally ineffective [7, 8].

The decision appealed from is reversed; DBP is declared the owner of Lot No. 1633, and the Mangawang brothers' title is cancelled [9].
