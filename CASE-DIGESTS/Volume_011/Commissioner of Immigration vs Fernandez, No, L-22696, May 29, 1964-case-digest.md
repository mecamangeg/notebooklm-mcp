I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION v. HON. F. FERNANDEZ, J. RODRIGUEZ, A. CAÑIZARES, THE COURT OF APPEALS, JUAN GARCIA and TEBAN CAOILI, G.R. No. L-22696, May 29, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
In 1961, Teban Caoili and his brothers arrived in the Philippines and applied for admission as citizens. The Board of Special Inquiry (BSI) admitted them as Filipino citizens by birth. On July 7, 1961, the Board of Commissioners (BOC) affirmed the BSI decision, and Teban was issued an Identification Certificate. However, in June 1962, a new BOC (constituted due to a change in administration) *motu proprio* reviewed the case under Sec. 27(b) of the Immigration Act, reversed the previous affirmation, and ordered Teban’s exclusion.

Teban was arrested in 1964. His relative filed a petition for *Habeas Corpus*, which the Court of First Instance denied, ruling the review was within the one-year statutory period. Teban appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which ordered his release on bond pending appeal. The Commissioner of Immigration filed a petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with the Supreme Court, arguing the CA lacked jurisdiction because the case involved purely legal questions and the release on bond was an abuse of discretion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and order the provisional release of the detainee.
2. W/N the new Board of Commissioners has the authority to review *motu proprio* a decision already affirmed by its predecessor Board.
3. W/N the exclusion proceedings violated due process rights to notice and hearing.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of Appeals has jurisdiction because the appeal involved questions of fact, specifically the propriety and regularity of the reversing order by the new Board and the lack of notice to Teban Caoili. As the case involved a person already declared a Filipino citizen—not merely an alien applying for admission—claiming deprivation of liberty, the CA correctly entertained the appeal and did not abuse its discretion in granting bail.

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the law (Sec. 27(b), Immigration Act) authorizes the Board of Commissioners to review *motu proprio* the decisions of the Board of Special Inquiry, not the decisions of its *predecessor* Board of Commissioners. Since the old Board had already affirmed the BSI decision in 1961, the new Board in 1962 was effectively reviewing the decision of the old Board, which is not authorized by law. To sanction such a review would cause chaos and insecurity of status.

3. **YES.** Even in administrative proceedings, cardinal primary rights such as the right to a hearing must be respected (*Ang Tibay v. CIR*). Teban Caoili was not notified of the 1962 review proceedings. The Commissioner's claim that Teban was in hiding was negated by evidence that he was openly employed, paying taxes, and registered as a voter. The cancellation of his citizenship and order of deportation without notice violated due process.

The petition is **DISMISSED**, and the writ of preliminary injunction is dissolved.
