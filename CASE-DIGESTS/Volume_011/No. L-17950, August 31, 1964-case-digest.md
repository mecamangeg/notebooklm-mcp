I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE LAND-AIR-SEA LABOR UNION (PLASLU) v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and CEBU PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY, G.R. No. L-17950, August 31, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Dr. Pantaleon Hermosisima was appointed as Medical Director of respondent Cebu Portland Cement Company (CEPOC), a government-owned and controlled corporation, on June 8, 1953 [1, 2]. Due to his lack of civil service eligibility for the classified position, his appointment was authorized as temporary under Section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code, valid for only three months [1]. His appointment was renewed periodically until March 20, 1955, when it was no longer renewed, and the position was subsequently abolished [3].

Petitioner PLASLU filed a motion in a pending CIR case (No. 241-V), claiming Dr. Hermosisima had become a permanent employee under a 1951 judgment which granted permanent status to employees with over three months of service, provided they were "hired intentionally for permanent position" [4, 5]. PLASLU argued he could not be dismissed without cause. Dr. Hermosisima also claimed he acquired civil service eligibility under Republic Act No. 1080, which recognizes board examinations as civil service equivalents [6].

The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) denied the motion, finding that Dr. Hermosisima was not hired for a permanent position due to his temporary status and that he failed to prove RA 1080 eligibility because his application was not under oath [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Dr. Hermosisima attained permanent status entitling him to security of tenure.
2. W/N Dr. Hermosisima validly acquired civil service eligibility under RA 1080.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that while Dr. Hermosisima served for more than three months, he was not "hired intentionally for permanent position," a requisite condition under the 1951 judgment [2, 7]. His appointments were expressly made for three-month periods pursuant to Section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code precisely because he lacked the necessary civil service eligibility [2]. As a GOCC, CEPOC is governed by Civil Service Law [2]. The non-renewal of a temporary appointment upon its expiration does not constitute dismissal; the appointee's tenure ceases automatically at the designated time (*Cuadra v. Cordova*) [6].

2. **NO.** The Court affirmed the CIR's rejection of the claim regarding Republic Act No. 1080. While the Act recognizes board examinations as civil service equivalents, the implementing regulations require the filing of a verified application [9, 10]. Evidence showed Dr. Hermosisima's application (Exh. D-1) was not subscribed and sworn to, which is an essential requisite for approval [8]. A mere physician's registration card (Exh. D) proves only the right to practice medicine, not civil service eligibility [11, 12].

The judgment of the Court of Industrial Relations is AFFIRMED [13].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Paredes, and Regala concurred [13].
