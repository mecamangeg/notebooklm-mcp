I. CAPTION
NATIONAL WATERWORKS & SEWERAGE AUTHORITY v. NWSA CONSOLIDATED UNIONS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18938, August 31, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner National Waterworks & Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) is a government-owned and controlled corporation. Respondent NWSA Consolidated Unions and intervenors (supervisory employees) raised various labor demands, including the implementation of the 40-Hour Week Law, distress pay, minimum wage adjustments, and overtime pay. The President certified the dispute to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR).

The CIR ruled against NAWASA, holding that: (1) NAWASA performs proprietary functions and is covered by Commonwealth Act (C.A.) No. 444 (Eight-Hour Labor Law); (2) it must pay 25% additional compensation for Sunday/holiday work; (3) intervenors are not managerial employees; (4) GAO and Bureau of Public Works (BPW) employees assigned to NAWASA are covered by C.A. No. 444; and (5) overtime cannot be offset by undertime. NAWASA appealed, arguing it exercises governmental functions and is exempt from C.A. No. 444.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N NAWASA performs governmental functions and is thereby exempt from C.A. No. 444.
2. W/N NAWASA, as a public utility, is liable for additional compensation for work on Sundays and legal holidays.
3. W/N the intervenors are "managerial employees" exempt from C.A. No. 444.
4. W/N GAO and BPW employees assigned to NAWASA are employees of NAWASA covered by C.A. No. 444.
5. W/N overtime work can be offset against undertime.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** NAWASA is a non-municipal public corporation that performs proprietary functions, not governmental ones [1, 2]. Its function of providing water supply and sewerage is "ministrant" and optional, similar to private industries like coal or gas companies [3]. Having a separate personality and the power to charge rates, it stands in a proprietary capacity and is therefore covered by C.A. No. 444 [4].

2. **YES.** While Section 4 of C.A. No. 444 generally exempts public utilities from paying the 25% premium for Sunday and legal holiday work, NAWASA is liable because it voluntarily assumed this obligation under its Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) [4, 5]. Contractual obligations prevail despite the statutory exemption [5].

3. **NO.** The intervenors (division chiefs, secretaries, etc.) do not fall under "managerial employees" as defined in R.A. No. 2377 [6, 7]. Their primary duties do not involve management of the establishment or policy formulation; they merely carry out orders and observe rigid office hours [8]. Thus, they are entitled to the benefits of C.A. No. 444.

4. **NO.** Employees of the General Auditing Office (GAO) and BPW assigned to NAWASA are employees of the National Government, not NAWASA [9, 10]. They are appointed and supervised by the Auditor General or Secretary of Public Works to ensure impartiality [11]. The fact that NAWASA pays their salaries is merely a designation of the fund source [12]. Consequently, they are governed by the Revised Administrative Code and other laws, not C.A. No. 444 [10].

5. **NO.** The method of offsetting overtime with undertime while charging the undertime to accrued leave is unfair [13]. This makes the employee "pay twice": once through the deduction of leave, and again by rendering overtime work without proper compensation [13].

**Decision affirmed with modification.** (The ruling regarding GAO and BPW employees was modified to exclude them from C.A. No. 444 coverage).
