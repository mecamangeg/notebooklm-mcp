I. CAPTION
LAGUNA TAYABAS BUS COMPANY v. JULIETA CORNISTA, thru her parents, GIL CORNISTA and MANUELA BELSONTA CORNISTA, G.R. No. L-22193, May 29, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Julieta Cornista, a passenger on petitioner’s Bus No. 284, sustained physical injuries after falling from the vehicle on November 9, 1957 [1, 2]. She filed a suit for damages based on breach of contract of carriage, alleging negligence by the petitioner and its driver [1]. The trial court found that the proximate cause of the injuries was the negligence of the petitioner and its driver, citing the driver's reckless speed on sharp curves and the bus's lack of a protective bar on the right side to safeguard passengers [2]. The trial court awarded Julieta P6,000.00 in moral damages, plus medical expenses and attorney's fees [1].

On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the finding of negligence but reduced the moral damages to P3,000.00 [1]. The CA found Julieta chargeable with contributory negligence because she was holding the hand of her friend instead of holding onto the bus itself [3]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the finding of contributory negligence should exempt it from liability or eliminate the award of moral damages [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is exempt from liability due to the passenger's contributory negligence.
2. W/N the award of moral damages is proper under Article 2220 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' ruling that while contributory negligence on the part of the injured party justifies the reduction of moral damages in a breach of contract of carriage, it does not justify the exemption from liability of the carrier [3]. The reduction of the award from P6,000.00 to P3,000.00 by the appellate court was deemed sufficient recognition of this circumstance.

2. **YES.** Under Article 2220 of the New Civil Code, moral damages in cases of breach of contract (including transport) may be awarded where the defendant acted with fraud or bad faith [4]. The Court ruled that the petitioner's negligence—specifically its failure to cover the right side of the bus with a bar or contrivance to protect passengers—falls within the category of misconduct contemplated by the law [4, 5].

The petition is **DISMISSED** for lack of merit [6].
