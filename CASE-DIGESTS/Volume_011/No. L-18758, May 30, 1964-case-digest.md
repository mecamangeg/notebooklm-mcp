I. CAPTION
DY PEK LONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18758, May 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Dy Pek Long, a citizen of the Chinese Nationalist Republic, filed a petition for naturalization. He arrived in the Philippines in 1940 and claimed to reside in Daet, Camarines Norte [1]. The Court of First Instance of Camarines Norte granted his petition [2]. The Provincial Fiscal appealed, arguing lack of social mingling and insufficient witness knowledge, but the Supreme Court found these specific objections unmeritorious [3]. However, upon review of the record, the Supreme Court discovered that the petitioner failed to state all his former places of residence in his petition [4]. Specifically, while he lived in Daet, he also resided in Manila for several years to attend high school (1947-1948) and college for engineering (1952-1955), as well as other stays in Manila in 1956 and 1959-1960 [4, 5]. These Manila residences were omitted from his petition filed on April 27, 1960 [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's failure to state all his former places of residence in the petition for naturalization is a fatal defect that disqualifies him from citizenship.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The failure to specify all prior places of residence is a serious flaw that disqualifies the petitioner. The purpose of requiring the disclosure of all places of residence is to facilitate the verification of the petitioner's activities, qualifications, and moral character by the public and government agencies in the localities where he lived [6]. By omitting these residences, the petitioner effectively falsified the truth, which indicates a lack of good moral character [6]. The Court cited *Keng Giok v. Republic* (L-13347) in support of this doctrine [6].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED** [7].
