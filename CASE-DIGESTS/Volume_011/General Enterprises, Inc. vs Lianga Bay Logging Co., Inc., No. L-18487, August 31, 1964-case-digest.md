I. CAPTION
GENERAL ENTERPRISES, INC. v. LIANGA BAY LOGGING COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-18487, August 31, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On May 25, 1959, defendant Lianga Bay Logging Company, Inc. (Producer) and plaintiff General Enterprises, Inc. (Distributor) entered into a contract whereby Lianga designated General as its distributor of logs to Korea and Europe for a 13% commission on the gross f.o.b. value. The contract term was two years starting June 1, 1959. Lianga expressly obligated itself to make available 2,000,000 board feet of logs per month for export starting September 1959.

In October 1959, Lianga sent a notice suspending operations and stopping the supply of logs, citing as reasons the restrictions imposed by the Philippine Government on barter, the enactment of the Margin Law, and machinery breakdowns. Lianga claimed these were force majeure events under the contract. General protested, reminding Lianga of its contractual obligations, but Lianga persisted in the suspension. General filed an action for breach of contract and damages in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal. The CFI ruled in favor of General, awarding P400,000 in actual damages, P100,000 in exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. Lianga appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the agreement is void for lack of cause or valid consideration.
2. W/N Lianga could validly suspend the contract due to fortuitous events (government restrictions and machinery breakdown).
3. W/N the obligation to supply 2,000,000 board feet of logs is a void potestative condition.
4. W/N the award of actual and exemplary damages is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The agreement is valid. The claim of fraud—that General failed to fulfill a promise to secure machinery and a loan—is baseless, as General merely promised to "help" and Lianga never demanded the loan. The contract has a valid cause: for Lianga, the distribution of its logs; and for General, the commitment to sell logs for a commission (onerous consideration).

2. **NO.** The suspension was unjustified. A fortuitous event does not extinguish an obligation unless it renders fulfillment impossible in a normal manner (*Lassam v. Smith*). The evidence showed that Lianga continued delivering logs to other parties and admitted having an "excess" of logs during the suspension period. The government restrictions and machinery issues alleged did not render compliance impossible.

3. **NO.** The provision is not a potestative condition. A condition making the validity or compliance of a contract dependent on the exclusive will of one party is void under Art. 1308 of the Civil Code. Ambiguities in the contract are construed against the party who drafted it (Lianga). The obligation to supply logs was reciprocal to General's obligation to sell them, not optional.

4. **YES, with modification.**
   - **Actual Damages:** The award of P400,000 is affirmed. Under Art. 2200 of the Civil Code, damages include *lucrum cessans* (profits the creditor failed to obtain). The Court found the estimate reasonable, calculated by multiplying the remaining contract volume (34 million bd. ft.) by the average commission rate General had previously earned. It was not speculative but based on proven facts.
   - **Exemplary Damages:** The award was reduced from P100,000 to P50,000. While Lianga’s use of "half-truths" to justify its breach was reprehensible, it did not act in a wanton, oppressive, or malevolent manner sufficient to justify the heavier penalty under Art. 2232 of the Civil Code.

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed with modification.
