I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROBERTO BOYLES and PIO MONTES, G.R. No. L-15308, May 29, 1964, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On November 28, 1959, at about 5:00 A.M. in Davao, Eminiano Bayo was attacked by an intruder, Felizardo Soria, while preparing breakfast. When Bayo’s wife, Brigida Misona, attempted to help, Soria called for his companions, appellants Roberto Boyles and Pio Montes. Boyles (armed with a gun) and Montes (armed with a knife) rushed in; Montes stabbed Bayo in the neck, killing him [1], [2]. Brigida jumped out a window, breaking her legs, but was dragged back inside. The appellants took P100.00 and took turns raping her beside her husband's corpse [2], [3].

Boyles and Montes pleaded guilty to the charge of robbery with homicide. The information alleged four aggravating circumstances: superior strength, dwelling, nighttime, and recidivism [4], [5]. Despite the plea, the trial court proceeded to trial due to the gravity of the offense and subsequently sentenced them to death. The defense argued on appeal that only dwelling and habituality were proved, which should be offset by the mitigating circumstances of the plea of guilty and lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a plea of guilty constitutes an admission of all aggravating circumstances alleged in the information.
2. W/N the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity (nighttime) was present.
3. W/N the aggravating circumstance of superior strength was present.
4. W/N the mitigating circumstance of lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong should be appreciated.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A plea of guilty constitutes an admission of all material facts alleged in the information, including aggravating circumstances [7], [8]. However, where the trial court proceeds to receive evidence despite the plea, and such evidence disproves an aggravating circumstance technically admitted by the plea, said circumstance should be disallowed in the judgment [9], [10].

2. **NO.** Nighttime is not an aggravating circumstance by and of itself; it becomes so only when specially sought by the offender to facilitate the commission of the crime or insure immunity [11], [12]. In this case, there was no evidence that the appellants purposely sought the cover of darkness, as the crime occurred at 5:00 A.M. purely by circumstance [10].

3. **YES.** The appellants used their greater number and weapons to overwhelm the unarmed victim. The fact that three armed aggressors attacked one unarmed man establishes the existence of superior strength [13], [9], [14].

4. **NO.** Article 13, paragraph 3 of the Revised Penal Code refers to the intention of the offender at the particular moment of executing the criminal act, not during the planning stage [13], [15]. Although the original plan may have been only to rob, the appellants employed deadly weapons and inflicted mortal wounds when the victim resisted. This conduct negates the claim of lack of intent to kill [16], [17].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed with modification [18].
