I. CAPTION
MACONDRAY & CO., INC. v. BERNARDO S. DUNGAO and RIZAL SURETY & INSURANCE CO., INC., G.R. No. L-18079, May 26, 1964, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Bernardo S. Dungao executed a promissory note for P6,100.00 in favor of Macondray & Co., Inc. secured by a mortgage on personal property [1, 2]. When Dungao defaulted, Macondray & Co. filed an action for the collection of the sum of money in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila on July 1, 1949 [3]. A writ of attachment was issued against Dungao's properties but was subsequently dissolved on September 21, 1949, after Dungao and Rizal Surety & Insurance Co., Inc. filed a surety bond [3].

On July 30, 1952, before the trial concluded, Dungao died [4]. His counsel moved for dismissal, arguing the action for money recovery did not survive his death [4]. The CFI denied the motion, ordered the substitution of the administratrix of Dungao’s estate, and rendered judgment ordering the estate and the surety to pay the principal amount plus interest and attorney's fees [5, 6]. The defendants appealed, questioning the jurisdiction of the trial court after the defendant's death [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for collection of money survives the death of the defendant pending final judgment in the Court of First Instance.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the action for recovery of money, debt, or interest does not survive the death of the defendant. Under Section 21 of Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, such an action must be dismissed to be prosecuted in the manner provided for the settlement of estates [8, 9]. Although the promissory note stated it was secured by a mortgage, the plaintiff did not seek foreclosure but purely the collection of a sum of money [10].

While the levy on attachment might have constituted an exception to the general rule on non-survival of claims, the attachment was discharged upon the filing of a bond, causing the property to revert to its previous condition free from specific liens [9, 10]. The rationale is to ensure all creditors receive a proportionate share of the estate [9]. However, the surety bond filed to discharge the attachment subsists and continues to answer for any money claim the plaintiff may be allowed by the probate court [11].

The judgments and order appealed from were **SET ASIDE**, without prejudice to the filing of the money claim by the plaintiff with the probate court [12].
