I. CAPTION
KOH CHET alias HIANCHIT S. CHUA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17223, June 30, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Koh Chet, born in Manila in 1934, filed a petition for naturalization [1, 2]. He claimed to be employed as a purchaser and salesman in his mother's *sari-sari* store with a monthly salary of P200.00 [2, 3]. At the time of testimony, he was a single, fifth-year engineering student [2, 4]. In his original petition, he averred he was merely helping in the store in return for support without a definite salary; the allegation of a P200.00 income was introduced later as an amendment [4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila granted the petition [5]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing the absence of lucrative income and lack of credibility of the character witnesses, noting inconsistencies in their testimonies regarding the death of the petitioner's father [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the character witnesses are credible and competent to vouch for the petitioner.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that a salary of P200.00 a month does not satisfy the requirement of a lucrative occupation, considering the purchasing value of the currency, citing *Ong Ling Chuan v. Republic* (L-18550) [3]. Furthermore, the Court found the very existence of this income doubtful [3]. The business was merely a small *sari-sari* store, and the petitioner was a full-time engineering student who had to devote a great deal of time to his studies, making it unlikely he could perform the alleged work [3, 4]. The income appeared to be a gratuitous dole from his mother rather than payment for actual work [4].

2. **NO.** The petitioner's witnesses, Carmen Basilio and Marcos Carolino, gave materially inconsistent statements, particularly regarding the death of the petitioner's father (one claimed he died in an air-raid shelter, the other said he died of a heart attack, while an affidavit showed the father was alive in 1950) [6]. These inconsistencies indicated that the witnesses did not know the petitioner intimately enough to vouch for his qualifications [6]. Additionally, the witnesses admitted they had not read the Constitution, rendering them incompetent to attest to the petitioner's adherence to its principles [6].

The appealed decision is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DENIED** [7].
