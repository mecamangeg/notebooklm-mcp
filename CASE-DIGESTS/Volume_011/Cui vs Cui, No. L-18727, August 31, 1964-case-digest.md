I. CAPTION
JESUS MA. CUI v. ANTONIO MA. CUI and ROMULO CUI, G.R. No. L-18727, August 31, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
The *Hospicio de San Jose de Barili* is a charitable institution established by the spouses Don Pedro and Doña Benigna Cui [1]. The deed of donation provides that administration shall pass to a male, legitimate descendant of their nephews who possesses a *"titulo de abogado"* (lawyer's title), doctor, civil engineer, or pharmacist [2]. In default of such titles, the one paying the highest taxes is preferred; under equal circumstances, the oldest is preferred [2].

Plaintiff Jesus Ma. Cui and defendant Antonio Ma. Cui are brothers and descendants of the founders' nephew [3]. Jesus is older and holds a Bachelor of Laws degree from UST (Class 1926) but is not a member of the Bar [4], [5]. Antonio is a member of the Bar; although disbarred in 1957 for immorality, he was reinstated by the Supreme Court on February 10, 1960 [5].

On February 27, 1960, the incumbent administrator resigned in favor of Antonio, who assumed office [3]. Jesus filed a *quo warranto* action claiming the office, arguing he was preferred by age [4]. The Court of First Instance of Cebu ruled in favor of Jesus, holding that *"titulo de abogado"* should be interpreted liberally to mean a law degree [6]. Antonio appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the term *"titulo de abogado"* in the deed of donation refers to mere possession of a Bachelor of Laws degree.
2. W/N the plaintiff's action for *quo warranto* is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that *"titulo de abogado"* means not merely possessing a law degree but membership in the Bar after due admission, qualifying one for the practice of law [6]. A Bachelor's degree alone does not entitle one to practice; admission requires passing examinations and taking the oath [6], [7]. The founders intended the administrator to have a working knowledge of the law and a license to practice to handle the *Hospicio's* regulations and properties [8]. Thus, Jesus, not being a member of the Bar, is disqualified [9]. Conversely, Antonio's reinstatement wiped out his previous disabilities, recognizing his moral rehabilitation [10].

2. **YES.** Under Section 16 of Rule 66, an action for *quo warranto* must be filed within one (1) year after the *plaintiff's* right to hold office arose, not from the date the defendant assumed office [10], [11]. Jesus had asserted his right to the office as early as 1932 and 1950 but failed to prosecute his claim judicially or file *quo warranto* against previous incumbents [12], [13], [14].

Accordingly, the judgment is **REVERSED** and set aside, and the complaint as well as the complaint in intervention are **DISMISSED** [15].
