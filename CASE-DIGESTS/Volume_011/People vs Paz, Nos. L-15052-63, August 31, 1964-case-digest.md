I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROMEO PAZ, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-15052-63, August 31, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Due to a labor dispute between the Raytranco employees’ union and Riz-Man Transit, which had leased Raytranco's lines, the union president, appellant Maximo Sta. Ana, and his co-strikers (appellants Patenia, Castalone, San Marcos, Unida, Reyes, and Mallari) conspired with a Hukbalahap band led by Commander Romy to destroy Riz-Man’s property [1], [2]. On the night of June 10, 1956, raiders disguised in army uniforms attacked the Riz-Man garage in Pililla, Rizal [3], [4]. They burned buses and the garage, looted cash and equipment, and killed the manager, Antonio Lee [3], [5].

The trial court convicted the appellants of arson and robbery with homicide, sentencing them to life imprisonment for the former and death for the latter [6]. The appellants claimed alibi and argued that if they were liable, the crime should be classified as simple rebellion because they were aided by Huks [7], [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the crime committed should be reduced to simple rebellion due to the participation of Huks.
2. W/N there was conspiracy among the appellants and the Huks.
3. W/N the extrajudicial statements of co-conspirators are admissible against the appellants.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the defense of rebellion must be proven by the accused, showing that they rose publicly and took up arms to overthrow the government [8]. Here, there was no political complexion to the crime; it was a private fight between disgruntled strikers and management [8]. The fact that the appellants recruited Huks to help execute a "criminal design to settle a grudge" did not alter the intrinsic nature of the crimes to simple rebellion [8].

2. **YES.** Conspiracy implies a concert of design, not necessarily participation in every detail of execution [9]. It was sufficient that there was a general plan to accomplish the result. The evidence, including the testimony of state witnesses, established that the appellants met with the Huks to plan the destruction of the garage [9].

3. **YES.** While a co-conspirator's extrajudicial confession is ordinarily inadmissible against co-defendants, it becomes admissible if corroborated by other evidence of record (U.S. v. Empeinado) [10]. Furthermore, failure to object to hearsay evidence constitutes a waiver of the right to cross-examine, making the evidence admissible [11].

**Disposition:** The judgment for arson is **AFFIRMED**. The judgment for robbery with homicide is **MODIFIED**; the death penalty is reduced to life imprisonment due to lack of the requisite vote [12].
