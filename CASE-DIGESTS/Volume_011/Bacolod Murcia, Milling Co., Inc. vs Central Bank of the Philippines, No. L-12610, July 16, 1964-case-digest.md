I. CAPTION
BACOLOD MURCIA MILLING CO., INC. v. CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-12610, July 16, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Bacolod Murcia Milling Co., Inc. secured an export license for a shipment of sugar in compliance with Central Bank Circular No. 20, which required the commandeering of dollar exchanges [1]. Under the regulations, commercial banks were designated as agents of the respondent Central Bank to handle shipping documents and collect the U.S. dollar proceeds of the sale [2]. Petitioner shipped the sugar with the accompanying drafts drawn in U.S. dollars but subsequently protested the collection of the proceeds by the Central Bank [3, 4]. Petitioner sought to prohibit the enforcement of the Circular and questioned its constitutionality [5]. Petitioner moved for reconsideration, arguing it was not estopped by its actions and that an injunction should issue against the unconstitutional Circular [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioner is estopped from questioning the enforcement of Central Bank Circular No. 20.
2. W/N the issue regarding the constitutionality of Circular No. 20 is moot.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The petitioner is estopped. The Court held that the act of securing an export license under the conditions of Circular No. 20 constituted estoppel [1]. Petitioner was aware that it was exporting sugar subject to the regulation that the proceeds would be collected by the Central Bank through its agent banks [3]. The protest was made only after the shipment was completed using the license; if petitioner truly objected, it should have refused to secure the license with those attached conditions [4].

2. **YES.** The issue is moot. The Court ruled that Republic Act No. 2609 (The Margin Law) superseded the power of the Central Bank to commandeer dollars earned by exporters [6]. This law was implemented by Central Bank Circular No. 133 (January 21, 1962), which adopted a program of gradual decontrol [7]. Consequently, it was unnecessary for the Court to pass upon the constitutionality of the superseded Circular No. 20 [7].

Motion for reconsideration denied [7].
