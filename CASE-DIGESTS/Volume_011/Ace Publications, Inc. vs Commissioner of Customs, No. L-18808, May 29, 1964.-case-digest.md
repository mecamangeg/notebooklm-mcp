I. CAPTION
ACE PUBLICATIONS, INC. v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS and THE COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-18808, May 29, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
From March 1959 to February 1960, petitioner Ace Publications, Inc. imported newsprints upon which the respondent Collector of Customs assessed and collected an aggregate of P86,000.00. Petitioner sent multiple letters to the Collector seeking a refund, but these were unheeded [1, 2]. Petitioner then wrote to the Commissioner of Customs on May 21, 1960, for a review and refund, but this likewise received no attention [2]. On February 9, 1961, petitioner filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), fearing its right to claim might lapse, citing the ruling in *College of Oral and Dental Surgery* regarding internal revenue taxes [3]. The Solicitor General moved to dismiss, arguing the CTA lacked jurisdiction because there was no decision by the Customs officials to review [4]. The CTA dismissed the petition *motu proprio* for lack of jurisdiction [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CTA has jurisdiction to review a petition for refund of customs duties in the absence of a decision by the Commissioner of Customs.
2. W/N the CTA can dismiss the petition *motu proprio*.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The CTA has no jurisdiction. Under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125, the CTA exercises "exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal... Decisions of the Commissioner of Customs" [6]. The Court held that without a decision from which an appeal can be taken, the petition for review is premature [5]. The Court rejected the petitioner's analogy to Section 306 of the National Internal Revenue Code (which allows filing a suit to prevent prescription even without a decision), stating that said section has no counterpart in the Tariff and Customs Code [7, 8]. There is no statutory grant for importers to go directly to the CTA without awaiting the decision of the Commissioner of Customs [8].

2. **YES.** The CTA has the power to dismiss a petition *motu proprio* when it appears the court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter [5]. The Court noted that the petitioner's admission that no action had been taken by the respondents was "fatally decisive" on the issue [5].

The resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED [9].
