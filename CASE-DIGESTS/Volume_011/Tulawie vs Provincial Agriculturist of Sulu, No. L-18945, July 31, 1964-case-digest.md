I. CAPTION
GENE M. TULAWIE v. THE PROVINCIAL AGRICULTURIST OF SULU, G.R. No. L-18945, July 31, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On August 20, 1959, petitioner Tulawie was issued a temporary appointment as Assistant Provincial Agriculturist of Sulu by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources [1]. When Tulawie presented himself to assume office on November 7, 1959, the respondent Provincial Agriculturist deferred his entry [2]. The respondent cited political reasons, fearing retaliation from the incoming Governor (a Liberal) because Tulawie’s family had campaigned for the opposing Nacionalista Party [3].

Tulawie was prevented from assuming office for months. He finally took his oath on June 17, 1960, but the respondent still refused to accept him [4]. Tulawie filed a petition for mandamus with preliminary injunction in the CFI of Sulu [4]. During the pendency of the case, the Secretary appointed Tulawie to a different position in Agusan to resolve the conflict [5, 6]. The CFI ruled in favor of Tulawie, ordering the payment of his emoluments from the date of his oath until his assumption of the new post [6]. The respondent appealed, arguing, among others, that Tulawie failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not appealing to the President [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to appeal the Secretary's action to the President constitutes a violation of the exhaustion of administrative remedies.
2. W/N the respondent could validly deny Tulawie’s assumption of office based on political affiliation.
3. W/N Tulawie is entitled to collect emoluments for the office he was prevented from assuming.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the action of a Department Secretary, who is an *alter ego* of the President, bears the implied approval of the latter [8]. Consequently, the failure to appeal the case to the President is not a violation of the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies [8].

2. **NO.** A person holding a valid appointment to a public office who has taken his oath has a clear right to enter upon the performance of his duties [8]. It is the ministerial duty of the superior to allow him that right [9]. The Court ruled that the fact that an appointee does not belong to the political party of the provincial governor is not a valid reason for denying said appointee the right to the office [9, 10].

3. **YES.** However, the award was modified. Since Tulawie’s appointment was temporary, its maximum duration was limited by law [11]. Citing Section 24(d) of Republic Act No. 2260, the Court held that six months is the maximum period for a temporary appointment [11]. Thus, Tulawie is entitled to emoluments starting from the date of his oath for a period not exceeding six months, or until he assumed his new position, whichever came first [11].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed with modification [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Paredes, and Makalintal concurred with the decision [12].
