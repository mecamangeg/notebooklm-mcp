I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. OLIMPIO LIMLINGAN, et al., G.R. No. L-19849, May 25, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
In the testate estate proceedings of Cecilia Bautista Limlingan, the Court of First Instance of Manila issued an order on February 1, 1962, declaring the proceedings closed on the ground that estate and inheritance taxes had already been paid. On March 7, 1962, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) filed a "Manifestation and Motion" stating that the amounts paid represented only a portion of the taxes due and requested that the proper amounts be verified, assessed, and collected before the case was closed. The lower court denied the motion and a subsequent motion for reconsideration, reasoning that an heir remains liable for taxes even after distribution and that the court had lost jurisdiction since the estate was already distributed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the probate court erred in closing the proceedings and denying the CIR's motion to determine the proper taxes due.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the probate court erred and committed an abuse of discretion. The Court considered the CIR's motion as a motion for reconsideration under **Rule 38 of the Rules of Court**, which was timely filed within 60 days of the closing order, noting that the CIR had no prior knowledge of the proceedings or time to check the correctness of the taxes paid.

Under **Section 103 of the National Internal Revenue Code** and **Rule 91, Section 1 of the Rules of Court**, no judge shall authorize the delivery of a distributive share, and no distribution shall be allowed, until the estate and inheritance taxes have been paid. Consequently, the proper tax amounts must be determined, assessed, and collected before the proceedings can be validly closed.

The orders were set aside, and the lower court was directed to proceed in accordance with the decision.
