I. CAPTION
PIO DE LARA, petitioner-appellee, vs. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, oppositor-appellant, G.R. No. L-18204, May 29, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pio De Lara, a citizen of the Chinese Nationalist Republic, filed a petition for naturalization [1]. He claimed to be born in Labo, Camarines Norte, on July 8, 1930, where he resided continuously, and completed his primary and secondary education in the Philippines [1, 2]. Based on these claims, he did not file a declaration of intention, asserting exemption under the law [2]. However, he could not produce a birth certificate because local civil registrar records were destroyed during World War II [2]. Instead, he relied on his own testimony and Alien Certificate of Registration, without presenting his living parents or a baptismal certificate to corroborate his place of birth [2, 3]. Furthermore, while he claimed continuous residence in Labo, he actually spent a significant time in Manila to obtain his Mechanical Engineering degree at Mapua Institute of Technology [1, 4]. His petition failed to list Manila as a place of residence, and his character witnesses were residents of Labo who did not reside in Manila [4]. The Court of First Instance of Camarines Norte granted the petition, and the Republic appealed [2, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner proved his birth in the Philippines sufficiently to be exempt from filing a declaration of intention.
2. W/N the character witnesses were qualified to attest to the petitioner's irreproachable conduct.
3. W/N the failure to state the petitioner's residence in Manila was a fatal defect.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner failed to sufficiently establish his birth in the Philippines. When civil records are destroyed, the claim of birth cannot be established merely by the petitioner's testimony [2]. It should have been corroborated by his parents (who were not shown to be dead) or by a baptismal certificate [2, 3]. Alien certificates of registration do not furnish proof of place of birth; they merely prove registration as an alien [3]. Consequently, he was not exempt from filing a declaration of intention [2].

2. **NO.** The character witnesses, who were residents of Labo, could not attest to the petitioner's good conduct and irreproachable character during the time he resided in Manila for his college studies [4]. The law requires that the petitioner conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during the *entire* period of his residence in the Philippines, and witnesses must be qualified to attest to this for the relevant periods [4].

3. **YES.** (It was a fatal defect). The Court ruled that the failure of the petition to state the different places of residence of the petitioner, specifically in Manila where he studied for some time, is a "serious flaw" in his claim for citizenship [6, 7].

**Decision reversed.** [5]
