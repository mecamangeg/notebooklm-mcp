I. CAPTION
ALEJANDRA ESQUIVEL-CABATIT alias ALEJANDRA RALUTIN VDA. DE CABATIT, GERINO ESQUIVEL and ANTONINA CABATIT v. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS and BASILIO FERNANDEZ, G.R. No. L-19756, May 25, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Basilio Fernandez filed a case in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) against petitioners for reinstatement as a tenant and for damages [1]. On September 1, 1961, the CAR rendered a decision ordering the Esquivels to reinstate Fernandez and pay him 50 cavanes of palay annually [2]. Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration, but the copy of the motion was sent to an Atty. Amado Evangelista, instead of the counsel of record, Atty. Rodrigo V. Fontelera [3]. Consequently, the trial court treated the judgment as final and issued a writ of execution on March 14, 1962 [2]. Petitioners filed a petition for review by certiorari, arguing they had not abandoned their motion for reconsideration [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the motion for reconsideration interrupted the period to appeal despite non-service of the copy to the adverse party's counsel of record.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the motion for reconsideration could not be entertained because a copy was not served upon the adverse party's counsel of record [3]. Under Rule 26, Section 6 of the Rules of Court, such a motion is considered "non-existent" and its filing does not interrupt the running of the period to appeal [3]. Citing *Manakil v. Revilla* and *Director of Lands v. Sanz*, the Court ruled that the lower court's decision had effectively become final and executory due to the failure of service [3].

The decision and order appealed from are affirmed, and the writ of preliminary injunction is dissolved [6].
