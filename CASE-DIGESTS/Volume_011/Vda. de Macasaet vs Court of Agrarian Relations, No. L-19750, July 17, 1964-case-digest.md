I. CAPTION
CARIDAD VDA. DE MACASAET v. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, LUCIO LANAO, ANGEL JARAPLASAN, PEDRO LLANTO, LORENZO DE LA CUEVA and SOUTHERN LUZON FARMERS' FEDERATION (PLUM), G.R. No. L-19750, July 17, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Caridad Vda. de Macasaet was the landowner of ricelands in Bay, Laguna, cultivated by private respondents Lucio Lanao, Angel Jaraplasan, Pedro Llanto, and Lorenzo de la Cueva under a 50-50 share tenancy system without written contracts [1, 2]. On August 1, 1960, the tenants, through the president of their union (PLUM), notified Macasaet of their desire to change their tenancy system from share to leasehold [2]. Macasaet denied the notice and the tenancy relationship [2]. The Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) ruled in favor of the tenants, declaring the change to leasehold effective and fixing the rentals [1]. Macasaet filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that Section 14 of the Share Tenancy Act, which authorizes the tenant to unilaterally change the system to leasehold, is unconstitutional because it impairs the obligation of contracts and deprives the landowner of property rights without consent [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Section 14 of the Share Tenancy Act authorizing the tenant to change the tenancy system from share to leasehold is constitutional.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that Section 14 of the Rice Share Tenancy Act is valid and constitutional [4, 5]. It is a privilege granted to the tenant under the exercise of the police power of the State to remedy an acute socio-economic problem existing in the country, specifically in Central Luzon [4, 6].

Citing its recent ruling in *Ramas v. Court of Agrarian Relations*, the Court held that the obligation of contracts must yield to the proper exercise of police power when used to preserve the security of the State [7]. The right granted to the tenant is not unreasonable or oppressive; although the landlord gives up a portion of the harvest (reducing the share from 30% to 25%), the tenant becomes more responsible and financially prepared, satisfying the Constitution's Social Justice directive [8]. The Court rejected the petitioner's reliance on Texas jurisprudence (*Rumbo v. Winterrowd*), stating it had no force in the Philippines as Texas does not face the same socio-economic problems [6].

Petition denied [9, 10].
