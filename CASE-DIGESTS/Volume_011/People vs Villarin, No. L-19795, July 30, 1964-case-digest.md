I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BIENVENIDO VILLARIN, G.R. No. L-19795, July 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Florentina Hanohan, a 15-year-old minor, filed a complaint for "acts of lasciviousness with consent of the offended party" against Bienvenido Villarin in the Justice of the Peace Court of Malimono, Surigao. The court convicted Villarin and sentenced him to *arresto mayor*. Villarin appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Surigao.

In the CFI, the Provincial Fiscal filed a new information charging Villarin with "corruption of minors" under Article 340 of the Revised Penal Code, a change from the original charge. Villarin pleaded not guilty. Subsequently, his counsel moved to quash the information on the ground that the facts did not constitute the crime charged. The CFI dismissed the case. The prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the CFI should have tried the case on the original charge or the new information as the facts were substantially similar.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the case by the Court of First Instance, upon motion of the accused's counsel, bars the reinstatement of the case due to double jeopardy.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that even if the lower court erred in dismissing the case, the error cannot be remedied by remanding the case for further proceedings because doing so would place the accused in double jeopardy.

The Court held that while a case appealed from the Justice of the Peace Court is tried *de novo*, the prosecution cannot change the nature of the offense charged in the new information filed in the CFI [1]. However, the specific impediment to reviving the case was that the dismissal was made without the **express consent** of the accused [2]. Although the motion to dismiss was filed by his counsel, this does not equate to the express consent required to waive the right against double jeopardy [2]. Consequently, the dismissal is final.

Appeal dismissed.
