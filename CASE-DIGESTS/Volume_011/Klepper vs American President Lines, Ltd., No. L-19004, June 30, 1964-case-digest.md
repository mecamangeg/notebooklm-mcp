**I. CAPTION**
RICHARD A. KLEPPER v. AMERICAN PRESIDENT LINES, LTD., G.R. No. L-19004, June 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiff Richard A. Klepper sued defendant American President Lines, Ltd. for damage to goods. The Court of First Instance (CFI) originally ruled in favor of Klepper, awarding the value of goods plus interest, attorney's fees, and costs. The Court of Appeals affirmed this decision *in toto*. On appeal to the Supreme Court (SC) in 1960, the SC modified the judgment by limiting the shipping company's liability to $500.00 as the value of the goods damaged, but explicitly stated that the decision "should be affirmed in all other respects" [1].

When the case was remanded for execution, the defendant tendered P1,000.00 (equivalent to $500.00) in full satisfaction of the judgment [2]. Plaintiff refused the tender. The CFI subsequently issued an order requiring the defendant to deposit not only the P1,000.00 but also legal interest on said amount from the date of filing the complaint, plus P1,000.00 in attorney's fees, citing the SC's affirmation of the rest of the lower court's decision [3]. The defendant appealed, arguing that since the SC limited liability to $500.00, imposing interest and fees would nullify the holding on the crux of the case [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Supreme Court's limitation of the carrier's liability to $500.00 precludes the collection of legal interest and attorney's fees.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that the limitation of liability applies only to the value of the goods damaged [5]. The previous Supreme Court decision explicitly stated that the lower court's judgment was "affirmed in all other respects" [5]. This affirmation covers the portions of the judgment awarding legal interest on the adjudicated amount and attorney's fees, which must therefore be enforced [5, 6]. The limitation on the principal value does not negate the accessory awards explicitly preserved by the Court's final judgment.

The order appealed from is affirmed [7].
