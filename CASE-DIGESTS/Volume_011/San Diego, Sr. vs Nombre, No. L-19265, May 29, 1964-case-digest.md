I. CAPTION
MOISES SAN DIEGO, SR. v. ADELO NOMBRE and PEDRO ESCANLAR, G.R. No. L-19265, May 29, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Adelo Nombre, then judicial administrator of an intestate estate in Special Proceedings No. 7279, leased a fishpond (Lot No. 1617) to respondent Pedro Escanlar for three years, expiring May 1, 1963, without prior judicial authority or approval. Nombre was subsequently removed and replaced by Sofronio Campillanos. Campillanos moved to lease the same fishpond to petitioner Moises San Diego, Sr. for five years. The Court of First Instance (CFI) declared the Escanlar lease void for lack of judicial authority and approved the lease to San Diego. Nombre and Escanlar filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA granted the writ and upheld the validity of the Escanlar lease, ruling that a judicial administrator may lease property without prior court approval. San Diego, who intervened in the case, appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a judicial administrator can validly lease estate property for a period of three years without prior judicial authority and approval.
W/N Article 1878 of the Civil Code on Agency, requiring a special power of attorney for leases exceeding one year, applies to a judicial administrator.

IV. RULING
**YES** (to the validity of the lease) and **NO** (to the applicability of Agency law).

The Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. Under Rule 85, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, an administrator has the right to possess and administer the estate of the deceased, which includes the power to lease property. The Court ruled that the provisions on Agency, specifically Article 1878 of the Civil Code which requires a special power of attorney to lease real property for more than one year, do not apply to a judicial administrator.

The Court explained that unlike an agent who is answerable only to his principal, a judicial administrator is appointed by the Court, must file a bond, and represents not only the estate but also the Court, the heirs, and the creditors (citing *Chua Tan v. Del Rosario*). The limits placed on agents by Article 1878 stem from the nature of control in agency agreements, whereas judicial administrators are subject to specific laws and the orders of the appointing court. Therefore, the lease contract executed by Nombre in favor of Escanlar was valid despite the lack of prior court authority.

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
