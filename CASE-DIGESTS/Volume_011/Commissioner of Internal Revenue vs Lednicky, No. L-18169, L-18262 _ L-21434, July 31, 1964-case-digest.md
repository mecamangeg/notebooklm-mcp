I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. V.E. LEDNICKY and MARIA VALERO LEDNICKY, G.R. Nos. L-18169, L-18262 & L-21434, July 31, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondents V.E. Lednicky and Maria Valero Lednicky were American citizens residing in the Philippines who derived all their income from Philippine sources for the taxable years 1955, 1956, and 1957 [1]. They paid their Philippine income taxes for said years but subsequently filed amended returns claiming deductions for federal income taxes they paid to the United States government on the same income [2-4]. They sought refunds for the alleged overpayments resulting from these deductions [2, 5]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) denied the refunds, but the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled in favor of the respondents, allowing the deduction of foreign income taxes from gross income [6, 7]. The CIR filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a U.S. citizen residing in the Philippines, whose income is derived wholly from Philippine sources, may deduct income taxes paid to the U.S. government from their Philippine gross income.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the respondents are not entitled to the deduction. Under Section 30(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, the right to deduct income taxes paid to a foreign government is given only as an "alternative or substitute" to the right to claim a tax credit for such foreign taxes under Section 30(c)(3) [8]. The law provides that the deduction is allowed only if the taxpayer does not signify a desire to avail of the tax credit; this implies that the taxpayer must have the legal right to claim such credit in the first place to exercise the option [8].

Since the respondents derived their income *wholly* from sources within the Philippines, they are not entitled to a foreign tax credit under the limitations prescribed in Section 30(c)(4), which limits credit based on the ratio of foreign income to total income [9, 10]. Because they are precluded from claiming the tax credit, the option to deduct disappears [10]. To allow the deduction regardless of the right to tax credit would render the specific limitation in the law regarding "signifying a desire" meaningless [8]. Furthermore, the Court noted that double taxation is not obnoxious when the same income is taxed by two different jurisdictions (U.S. based on citizenship, Philippines based on source and residence) [11, 12].

**Decision reversed and disallowance of refunds claimed by respondents affirmed.** [13]
