I. CAPTION
STATE BONDING & INSURANCE CO., INC. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18754, June 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff State Bonding & Insurance Co., Inc., as subrogee of seven consignees, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against defendants Manila Port Service (arrastre operator) and Manila Railroad Company. The plaintiff sought to recover the value of goods allegedly short-delivered from seven shipments discharged into the custody of the Manila Port Service [1].

In their answer, the defendants argued that they had delivered to the consignees the same quantity and condition of merchandise as they had actually received from the carrying vessels. They further claimed regarding one cause of action that the plaintiff’s predecessor unlawfully refused to take delivery [2]. The CFI rendered a decision ordering the defendants to pay the sums claimed for most causes of action, plus attorney's fees [3], [4].

The defendants appealed directly to the Supreme Court, contending that the plaintiff failed to prove the arrival of the shipments, the dates of discharge, and the actual quantity/condition of goods unloaded into the operator's custody [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the arrastre operator is liable for the short-delivery of the cargo despite the alleged lack of direct proof regarding the specific quantity discharged.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court [5].

The Court held that the plaintiff did not need to prove the arrival or discharge of the goods because the defendants admitted these facts in their answer. By alleging they delivered the "same quantity and condition" as received from the vessel, the defendants admitted the shipments had arrived and were unloaded into their custody [6].

Furthermore, the management contract requires the arrastre operator to check all cargo and furnish consignees with a "short-landing certificate" if there is any shortage [7], [8]. The non-presentation of such a certificate by the Manila Port Service prevents them from disputing that the cargo was unloaded in good condition as stated in the bills of lading [9], [8].

Finally, the Court ruled that the "tally receipts," which record the actual discharge of goods, are kept by the vessel and the arrastre operator [10]. If these documents supported the defendants' claim that the goods were not landed, it was their duty to present them. Their failure to do so is a circumstance prejudicial to them, not the plaintiff [11], [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Justices Labrador, Barrera, and Dizon took no part) [5].
