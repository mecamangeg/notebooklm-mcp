**I. CAPTION**
ALFONSO DE LOS REYES, ET AL. v. LUIS DE LEON, G.R. No. L-16217, May 25, 1964, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
In 1944, appellees (De los Reyes et al.) obtained a loan of ₱60,000 (Japanese currency) from appellant De Leon, secured by real estate mortgages. The contracts stipulated that the loan should be paid "not sooner nor later than within the first three (3) years after the Greater East Asia War," computed from the signing of the Treaty of Peace. A special condition provided that if the loan was paid after the Treaty's proclamation, the debt would be reduced to ₱30,000. The mortgage also contained an acceleration clause stating that failure to pay obligations, such as taxes, would make the entire loan due and payable, allowing for extrajudicial foreclosure.

On August 5, 1953, appellant’s lawyer notified appellees that due to their failure to pay real estate taxes for 1951, 1952, and 1953, the entire ₱60,000 loan was due and foreclosure proceedings were being initiated. Appellees paid the back taxes on September 3, 1953, prior to the scheduled sale. Appellant nevertheless insisted on foreclosing for the full ₱60,000. The trial court declared the foreclosure proceedings null and void.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the appellees incurred in default warranting the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgage.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court ruled that the appellees did not incur in delay. Under **Article 1169 of the Civil Code**, those obliged to do something incur in delay only from the time the obligee judicially or extrajudicially demands fulfillment. Here, there was no previous demand for the payment of taxes or the loan prior to the notice of foreclosure.

Furthermore, the Court held that the non-payment of taxes was not a material breach sufficient to warrant foreclosure, considering the principal stipulation regarding the payment period (dependent on the Peace Treaty). The payment of taxes by appellees before the foreclosure sale constituted **substantial compliance**.

Finally, under **Article 1198 of the Civil Code**, the appellees did not lose the right to make use of the period because the timely payment of taxes was not the consideration which moved the parties to fix the period. To allow foreclosure for ₱60,000 would be oppressive, as it would penalize appellees for an acceleration they did not choose, depriving them of the right to pay the reduced amount of ₱30,000 after the Treaty proclamation.

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED**.
