I. CAPTION
CELESTINO C. ROSCA, ET AL. v. HON. FEDERICO C. ALIKPALA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22088, July 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners sought clarification of the Supreme Court's decision dated June 30, 1964 [1]. Previously, on August 5, 1963, respondent Judge Alikpala issued an order enjoining the Acting Commissioner of Civil Service from re-examining petitioners' status and directing Caloocan City officials to restore petitioners to their positions and pay their salaries [2]. On August 9, 1963, the Judge issued an amendatory order *motu proprio* to eliminate the directive against the Caloocan City officials because they were outside his territorial jurisdiction, citing *Acosta v. Alvendia* [3, 4]. However, the dispositive portion of this amendatory order inadvertently eliminated the mandatory directive against *all* respondents, including the Commissioner of Civil Service, contrary to the Judge's stated intent in the body of the order [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the oversight in the dispositive portion of the amendatory order, which eliminated the directive against the Commissioner of Civil Service, may be corrected.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the elimination of the mandatory directive against the Commissioner of Civil Service was merely due to an oversight [5]. The text of the amendatory order explicitly stated that the modification was intended only for the Caloocan City officials due to jurisdictional limits [3, 4]. Where the main purpose of an amendatory order is merely to eliminate the directive against specific respondents, but through oversight eliminates it against all, the flaw may be corrected to restore the directive as intended [6].

The petition is GRANTED regarding the restoration of the directive against the Commissioner of Civil Service, and DISMISSED regarding the Caloocan City officials [7].
