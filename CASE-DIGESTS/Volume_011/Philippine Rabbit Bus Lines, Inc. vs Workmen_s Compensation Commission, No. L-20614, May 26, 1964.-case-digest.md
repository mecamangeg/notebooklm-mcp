I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE RABBIT BUS LINES, INC. v. THE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and ILDEFONSO RODUMBAN; and PHILIPPINE RABBIT BUS LINES, INC. v. HON. JULIAN E. LUSTRE and ILDEFONSO RODUMBAN, G.R. Nos. L-20614 and L-21517, May 26, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Ildefonso Rodumban filed a compensation claim against Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc. (Petitioner) for loss of sight. The hearing officer ruled in Rodumban's favor, and the case was elevated to the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC). Petitioner claimed it never received notice of the WCC's decision affirming the award until it later received a petition for execution filed by Rodumban in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Tarlac. Upon inspection of WCC records, Petitioner discovered the notice of judgment was signed by a person not employed by its counsel. Petitioner filed a motion with the WCC to declare the service void, but the WCC denied it, declaring the decision final and executory. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari (G.R. No. L-20614) challenging this denial. Meanwhile, the CFI of Tarlac granted Rodumban's motion for execution. Petitioner filed a second certiorari petition (G.R. No. L-21517) against the CFI Judge to stop the execution.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N certiorari is the proper remedy to challenge the WCC order denying the motion to declare the notice of judgment void.
2. W/N the WCC acted with grave abuse of discretion in ruling that the decision had become final and executory.

IV. RULING
1. **NO**. The Supreme Court held that the WCC's order denying the motion to declare the notice of judgment void is analogous to a denial of a petition for relief from a final judgment. As such, the order is final and appealable in character. Therefore, the Petitioner should have availed of the remedy of **appeal** rather than a special civil action of certiorari [1, 2].

2. **NO**. The Court ruled that the question of whether Petitioner was properly served is a factual issue. The WCC found that the signature on the notice belonged to "someone in the office of respondent's counsel" who "obviously knew what he was doing" [3, 4]. The Court held that even if the WCC's factual conclusion was wrong, such error would only be an error of judgment and does not constitute grave abuse of discretion [4]. Since the WCC decision was validly deemed final and executory, the proceedings for execution in the CFI of Tarlac were proper [4].

Petitions dismissed and writs prayed for denied [5].
