I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. EFREN MARTIN, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-18763-64, May 23, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of December 17, 1960, Emilio Martin stoned the house of the victim, Edmundo Nepomuceno, and challenged him to a fight. Later, when Edmundo left his house to buy medicine, he was grabbed and stabbed by Efren Martin. Subsequently, Edmundo was assaulted collectively by the Martin brothers (Efren, Agustin, Elino, and Eriberto) and others, who stabbed and hit him while he was held down. Edmundo died from multiple injuries, including four stab wounds and a hacking wound. The motive stemmed from Edmundo's relationship with the Martins' sister. The Court of First Instance of Manila convicted the four Martin brothers of murder. Eriberto withdrew his appeal. The remaining appellants (Efren, Agustin, and Elino) raised defenses of alibi and claimed that only Eriberto was responsible for the killing in self-defense.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defenses of alibi and self-defense/sole responsibility of the co-accused are tenable against the physical evidence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court ruled that the version of the defense—that Eriberto alone fought the victim in self-defense—was belied by the physical evidence. The victim sustained multiple serious stab wounds and a hacking wound caused by different instruments (a heavy sharp-edged instrument and a sharp-edged pointed instrument) [1, 2]. Conversely, Eriberto did not suffer even a scratch, which was highly improbable if the victim had truly been chasing him with two knives as claimed [3]. The number and nature of the wounds clearly indicated a collective aggression by multiple assailants using different weapons, disproving the theory of a lone self-defender [4, 5]. Furthermore, the alibis provided were "shot through with so many flaws" and were rejected in the face of positive identification and the proximity of the accused's residences to the crime scene [6, 7].

Decision affirmed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, and Makalintal concurred.
