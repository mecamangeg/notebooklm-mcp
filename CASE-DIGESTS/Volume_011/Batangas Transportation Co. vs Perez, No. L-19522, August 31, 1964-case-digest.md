I. CAPTION
BATANGAS TRANSPORTATION COMPANY v. TOMAS PEREZ and THE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-19522, August 31, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Tomas Perez was employed as a bus driver for Batangas Transportation Co. since 1952, plying the rough, dusty Lobo-Manila route for 10-11 hours daily. On January 20, 1957, while driving, his bus was bumped by a truck, causing him physical injuries. Although he continued working, he began coughing profusely. His condition deteriorated from bronchitis to pulmonary tuberculosis, confirmed on March 2, 1958, leading him to stop working. He was dismissed by the company in October 1958 [1].

The Hearing Officer awarded Perez compensation and medical services. The company appealed to the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC). Perez did not appeal. The WCC affirmed the compensability of the illness, finding that the accident lowered Perez's resistance and his grueling work aggravated the latent disease. The WCC also awarded P300.00 in attorney's fees to Perez [2-4]. The petitioner questioned the causal link of the illness, the validity of the award after employment ceased, and the grant of attorney's fees.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Perez's pulmonary tuberculosis is compensable under the Workmen's Compensation Act.
2. W/N the award is valid even if the employer-employee relationship no longer existed at the time of judgment.
3. W/N the WCC erred in awarding additional attorney's fees to Perez.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Section 2 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, an illness is compensable if it was aggravated by employment or was the result of the nature of the employment [5]. Although the illness was not "directly caused" by the employment, the accident on January 20, 1957, lowered Perez's vitality and resistance, making him susceptible to the disease. Furthermore, the "taxing labors" of driving on dusty, pitted roads for long hours daily definitely aggravated his injuries and hastened the attack of the disease [5, 6]. The Workmen's Compensation Act is a social legislation that must be liberally construed [7].

2. **YES.** It is not necessary that the employer-employee relationship exist at the time the judgment is rendered. If this were required, employers could evade obligations under the Act by simply dismissing employees as soon as adjudications of injury or illness arise, which would be absurd [8].

3. **YES.** The Commission erred in awarding P300.00 as attorney's fees. Perez did not appeal the decision of the Hearing Officer. It is a settled rule that in an appellate court or body, no additional award may be given to a party who has not appealed [9].

The judgment of the Workmen's Compensation Commission is **AFFIRMED**, with the elimination of the amount for attorney's fees [9].
