I. CAPTION
PASTOR ACIBO, ET AL. v. HON. HIGINIO MACADAEG, MARIA PAZ MENDOZA-GUAZON, and SHERIFF OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-19701, June 30, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Dr. Maria Paz Mendoza-Guazon filed an ejectment suit against petitioners and others in the Municipal Court of Manila, which ruled in her favor, ordering defendants to vacate and pay back rents. Petitioners appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila but failed to file a supersedeas bond or deposit current rents. Consequently, upon Mendoza-Guazon's motion, the CFI ordered immediate execution. Petitioners subsequently filed supersedeas bonds and moved to suspend the execution, while respondent moved for demolition. The CFI denied petitioners' motion, disapproved their bonds, and ordered demolition. Petitioners alleged grave abuse of discretion and denial of due process, arguing they were not heard on the demolition motion and were not given reasonable time to vacate before the Sheriff carried out the demolition nine days after the writ was served.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CFI committed grave abuse of discretion in ordering immediate execution and refusing to approve the late supersedeas bonds.
2. W/N the petitioners were denied due process regarding the issuance and implementation of the demolition order.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 8, Rule 70 (formerly Rule 72) of the Rules of Court, if a defendant in an ejectment case fails to file a supersedeas bond or deposit on time the monthly rents, the court has a "ministerial and imperative" duty to order immediate execution [1, 2]. While the CFI may allow the late filing of a bond before the judgment is executed, this is a "discretion to grant or to deny," not a mandatory duty to allow it [3]. Furthermore, petitioners failed to make cash deposits for current rents, and the Court held that a bond cannot substitute for the required cash deposits for future rents [4].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that oral argument is not necessary for due process; it is sufficient that the parties made their positions known through their motions and oppositions [5]. Regarding the service of the order, it is not necessary for the order of demolition to be served before the writ of demolition because such an order is not appealable [6, 7]. Finally, the Court found that the nine-day period between the service of the writ and the actual demolition constituted reasonable time for petitioners to remove their houses [7].

Petition denied.
