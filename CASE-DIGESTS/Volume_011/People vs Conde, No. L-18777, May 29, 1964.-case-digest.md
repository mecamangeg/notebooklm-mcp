I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CONDE**, G.R. No. L-18777, May 29, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of April 19-20, 1958, an armed band broke into a warehouse in San Manuel, Pangasinan, robbing Rodolfo Ganancial of P20.00 and fatally shooting Mariano Raquiza. State witness Dominador Bermudez testified that the group acted under the orders of appellant Dionisio Conde. Although Conde did not join the group physically, claiming his wife was sick, he supplied Bermudez with a .38 caliber gun and placed the group under the command of another.

Conde and co-accused Felipe Ortiz were charged with robbery in band with homicide. The trial court convicted Conde as a principal by induction, relying on Bermudez's testimony, but appreciated the mitigating circumstance of lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong because Conde was not present at the scene. Conde appealed, arguing that Bermudez's testimony was uncorroborated and claiming an alibi.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the uncorroborated testimony of a co-conspirator is sufficient to sustain a conviction.
2. W/N the appellant is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the testimony of co-conspirator Bermudez was credible because it was corroborated in several respects by prosecution witnesses and co-defendant Ortiz [1]. Conversely, Conde's alibi was "absolutely uncorroborated," as he failed to present even his common-law wife to support his claim [1]. Furthermore, Conde admitted he knew of no motive for Bermudez to falsely implicate him, considering they were friends [1].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the mitigating circumstance under Article 13, No. 3 of the Revised Penal Code cannot be granted merely on the surmise that the appellant, not being physically present, had no intention to commit the homicide. This claim is refuted by the fact that every member of the band carried firearms, and Conde himself supplied the gun used by one of the members [2].

The crime committed was robbery in band with homicide (Article 294, par. 1). Considering the aggravating circumstances of band and nighttime, the proper penalty would be the maximum period (death); however, due to the lack of necessary votes, the penalty of life imprisonment imposed by the lower court was affirmed [3].

**Decision affirmed.**
