I. CAPTION
ALBERT WRIGHT, JR., ET AL. v. LEPANTO CONSOLIDATED MINING CO. and VICTOR LEDNICKY, G.R. No. L-18904, July 11, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants, heirs of Albert Wright, filed a complaint against Lepanto Consolidated Mining Co. and Victor Lednicky for the recovery of possession and ownership of two mining claims ("Copper Placer" and "Lepanto Fraction") in Mt. Province. Plaintiffs claimed that their father, Albert Wright, was the patentee and owner of the claims based on 1907 survey plats and a 1925 Bureau of Mines publication listing him as the patentee as of 1923 [1]. They argued their father never transferred the claims and that they, being minors upon his death, did not do so either [2].

Defendants-appellees were in possession of the properties and held Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs) which were judicially reconstituted in 1949 by the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bontoc under Republic Act No. 26 [1, 3]. Lepanto derived its rights from trustees of Philip C. Whitaker, whose titles were cancelled and replaced in 1934 and subsequently transferred to Lepanto in 1936 [4]. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that the reconstituted titles were binding [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the plaintiffs' evidence is sufficient to overcome the validity of the defendants’ judicially reconstituted Transfer Certificates of Title.
2. W/N the plaintiffs’ action is barred by laches.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The proceedings for the reconstitution of certificates of title are proceedings *in rem* that bind all persons [6]. Under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 26, reconstituted titles have the "same validity and legal effect as the originals thereof" [6]. To overcome these titles, plaintiffs had the burden to show clearly and positively that no transfer was ever made by their father, which they failed to do [7]. The listing in the Bureau of Science Bulletin is hearsay and does not preclude prior transfers [7]. Furthermore, Lepanto acquired the claims in 1936 relying on the face of the Torrens titles of its predecessors; thus, its possession is in good faith, reinforced by the presumption of just title under Articles 433 and 541 of the Civil Code [8].

2. **YES.** Even assuming plaintiffs' father held a Torrens title and that ownership cannot be defeated by prescription, their rights are barred by laches [9]. The plaintiffs remained inactive for nearly thirty years while defendants operated, developed, and invested in the mines [9]. Such long inaction, coupled with renewed activity only after the destruction of official records, indicates an unmeritorious claim [9].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED [10].
