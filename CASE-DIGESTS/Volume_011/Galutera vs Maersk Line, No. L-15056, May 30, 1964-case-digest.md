I. CAPTION
M. S. GALUTERA v. MAERSK LINE, CIA. GRAL. DE TABACOS DE FILIPINAS and/or DELGADO BROS., INC., G.R. No. L-15056, May 30, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In June 1955, a shipment of 12 bales of cotton prints arrived in Manila from New York aboard the SS "Johannes Maersk," operated by Maersk Line. The shipment was consigned to the Bank of the Philippine Islands with arrival notice to plaintiff M.S. Galutera, who subsequently became the owner. Galutera cleared the shipment through Maersk’s agent, Tabacalera, and the arrastre operator, defendant Delgado Bros., Inc. Upon delivery, one bale of cotton prints valued at P1,459.56 was missing [1].

Galutera filed a suit for recovery. The Court of First Instance of Manila found that the loss was attributable to Delgado Bros., Inc. However, the trial court denied recovery to Galutera because she had already received the value of the missing bale from her insurer, American Insurance Company [2]. Galutera argued she received the money not as payment but as a loan, repayable only to the extent of any recovery from the liable party, as evidenced by a written "loan receipt" (Exhibit F) [3]. The trial court upheld Delgado Bros.' argument that the insurer was the real party in interest due to subrogation and dismissed the case [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the insured plaintiff may recover from the liable arrastre operator despite having received the value of the loss from the insurer under a "loan receipt" agreement.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court ruled that a loan to the insured by the insurer, repayable only out of money collected on account of the loss, is not deemed a payment of insurance [6, 7]. Consequently, the transaction does not constitute a satisfaction of the claim and does not subrogate the insurer to the insured's rights against the carrier or bailee [8].

The Court cited *First National Bank of Ottawa v. Lloyd's of London* and *The Guiding Star*, holding that such arrangements are customary to place the insured in funds without divesting them of their title or interest in the property [8, 9]. Since Delgado Bros., Inc. is indisputably liable for the loss, the question of whether payment should be made to the insured or the insurer is a technicality that should be overlooked. Under the binding written agreement (Exhibit F), Galutera is obligated to repay the insurer upon recovery. Allowing her to sue avoids unnecessary delay and multiplicity of suits [10, 11].

The judgment was reversed, and Delgado Bros., Inc. was ordered to pay the plaintiff P1,459.56 with legal interest and costs [11].
