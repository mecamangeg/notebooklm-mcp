I. CAPTION
KIM KEE, CHUA YU & CO., INC. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and RIZALINO MANZANO, G.R. No. L-16803, June 29, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On March 13, 1959, respondent Rizalino Manzano filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to recover unpaid overtime compensation from petitioner Kim Kee, Chua Yu & Co. Manzano alleged he worked as a labor inspector for the petitioner from 1948 until January 31, 1959, rendering 2,712 hours of overtime work without pay [1, 2]. Crucially, Manzano was no longer employed by the petitioner at the time of filing and did not request reinstatement [1, 3]. The petitioner raised the defense of lack of jurisdiction, arguing the claim was purely monetary. The CIR trial judge denied the plea, and the CIR *en banc* upheld the judge's decision [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over a claim for overtime compensation filed by a former employee who does not seek reinstatement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the Court of Industrial Relations lacks jurisdiction. Citing *Chua Workers' Union (NLU) v. City Automotive Co.* and *National Shipyards & Steel Corp. v. CIR*, the Court held that when a former employee demands compensation for overtime work already rendered without requesting reinstatement, the claim is merely monetary [2, 3]. Such claims must be ventilated in the regular courts, not the Industrial Court [3].

The petition was **GRANTED**, the order of the respondent court reversed, and the complaint dismissed without prejudice to its filing in the proper court [4].
