I. CAPTION
SIMEONA CUMPLIDO v. PRESENTACION MENDOZA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20265, June 30, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Simeona Cumplido was the defendant in a civil case for Quieting of Title in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan. Initially, the trial court rendered judgment in her favor. However, upon respondent Presentacion Mendoza's motion for reconsideration, the court issued an amended decision on April 27, 1962, awarding half the property to Mendoza. Cumplido received this order on April 28, 1962.

On May 23, 1962, Cumplido filed a Notice of Appeal and deposited a cash appeal bond. On May 26, 1962, three days before the expiration of the 30-day reglementary period, her counsel filed a Motion for Extension of 15 days to file the Record on Appeal. Since no judge was presiding over the CFI of Bulacan at that time, the motion was not acted upon. Cumplido eventually filed the Record on Appeal on June 13, 1962.

Mendoza opposed the approval of the Record on Appeal on the grounds that the cash bond was not served on her and the record was filed out of time. The respondent Judge denied the approval of the Record on Appeal, dismissed the appeal, and issued a writ of execution. Cumplido filed a petition for Mandamus with Preliminary Injunction.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the non-service of the cash appeal bond on the adverse party prevents the perfection of the appeal.
2. W/N the Record on Appeal was filed within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the non-service of a cash appeal bond upon the adverse party does not affect the perfection of an appeal, provided such appeal bond is presented within the prescribed period [1, 2]. The Court relied on the rulings in *Espartero v. Ladaw* and *Gammad v. Arranz* [3].

2. **NO.** The Record on Appeal was not filed on time. The original period to file expired on May 28, 1962. Although a motion for extension was filed, the Court ruled that counsel had no right to assume the motion would be conceded [3]. Given the absence of a presiding judge, the petitioner should have availed of the remedies under Section 88 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, which authorizes the Justice of the Peace to act on interlocutory matters [3]. Furthermore, even if the requested 15-day extension were granted, the period would have expired on June 12, 1962. Since the Record on Appeal was filed on June 13, 1962, it was filed one day late [3]. Petitioner failed to establish a clear right to the writ of mandamus [4].

Petition is **DENIED**.
