I. CAPTION
ROMAN MIRASOL v. MANUEL R. YUSAY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18862, June 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Manuel R. Yusay owned Hacienda Retiro and leased a portion of it to Petitioner Roman Mirasol. The lease contract granted Mirasol an option to buy the property "en igualdad de precio y condiciones" (at equal price and conditions) should Yusay decide to sell. On June 23, 1958, Yusay wrote to Mirasol offering to sell the hacienda for P100,000.00 in cash, requesting a reply by June 30, 1958. Mirasol replied on June 27, 1958, stating he was interested to buy at the "same PRICE, MANNER, CONDITIONS, AND CONSIDERATIONS other buyers will offer," claiming he knew Yusay had already sold to Maria Yulo. On July 2, 1958, Mirasol sent a follow-up letter claiming to accept the offer but asking for a meeting to consummate the contract. Yusay received both letters on July 5 but did not reply. On July 16, 1958, Yusay sold the hacienda to Yulo for a stated P35,000.00, though the court found the total consideration (including debt condonation and jewelry) amounted to P100,000.00. The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's decision that Yusay's offer was valid and Mirasol's letters did not constitute a valid acceptance.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Yusay's offer was in accordance with the option contract.
2. W/N Mirasol's letters constituted a valid acceptance of the offer.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the option clause meant Yusay had to give Mirasol the first opportunity to buy the hacienda at the same price and conditions he would be willing to sell to others. Yusay complied by offering the property to Mirasol for P100,000.00, the same total consideration he eventually received from Yulo [1]. The Court rejected Mirasol's theory that Yusay was required to find a third-party buyer first before offering the land to him, noting that such an interpretation is untenable and contrary to the usage and customs of the place regarding contract interpretation (Article 1376, Civil Code) [1, 2].

2. **NO.** Mirasol's reply stating he was "interested to buy... in the same PRICE... other buyers will offer" was held not to be an acceptance but merely an indication that he would await the offers of other prospective buyers [3]. This attitude was considered a waiver of the option. Furthermore, Yusay did not sell the property until July 16, 1958, giving Mirasol nearly a month to exercise his right if he were truly capable of paying the P100,000.00 price, which he failed to do [4].

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
