I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. PRISCILA ESTATE, INC. and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-18282, May 29, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Priscila Estate, Inc. (respondent), a corporation engaged in leasing real estate, claimed a refund for overpaid income tax for the year 1950. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) subsequently investigated the respondent's returns for 1949-1951, granting a tax credit for 1950 but assessing deficiency taxes for 1949 and 1951 [1]. The dispute reached the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), which ordered the CIR to refund P3,045.19 to the respondent [1].

The CIR appealed to the Supreme Court, raising several issues:
1.  **The 1949 Deduction:** The CTA allowed a deduction of P11,237.35 for the cost of a "barong-barong" (makeshift building) demolished on December 31, 1949, to make way for a new building [2]. The CIR argued this should be capitalized. The respondent contended the removal was forced by city authorities because the structure was a fire hazard [3, 4].
2.  **Depreciation Basis:** For "Building Priscila No. 3," acquired from the Sison spouses in exchange for stock, the CIR argued depreciation should be based on the assessed value (P70,343.00). The respondent used the construction cost (P110,600.00), having revalued the property by board resolution to acknowledge an obligation to the vendors for the difference [5].
3.  **Prescription:** The CIR argued the 1950 refund claim was barred by the two-year prescriptive period under Section 306 of the Internal Revenue Code, as the action was filed in 1956 for taxes paid in 1951 [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1.  W/N the value of a compulsorily demolished building is deductible as a loss from gross income.
2.  W/N the basis for depreciation of a building acquired for stock should be its construction cost rather than its assessed value.
3.  W/N the government's defense of prescription is deemed waived if not pleaded.

IV. RULING
1.  **YES.** The Court held that the value of the demolished building is deductible from gross income. The removal was not voluntary but was forced upon the taxpayer by city authorities because the structure was a fire hazard [3, 4]. Since the demolished building was not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, its loss should be charged off as a deduction under Section 30(2) of the Internal Revenue Code [5].

2.  **YES.** The Court ruled that depreciation must be based on the construction cost. The corporation revalued the property based on construction cost, importing an obligation to pay the vendors (Sison spouses) the difference between the assessed value and the revalued cost [5]. Consequently, the ultimate corporate investment was the construction cost, making it the logical basis for depreciation [3, 4].

3.  **YES.** While the CIR's argument on prescription would have been tenable, the failure to plead prescription in a motion to dismiss or as a defense in the answer constituted a waiver of such defense under Section 10, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court [6].

**Decision affirmed.**
