I. CAPTION
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and CRISPIN PINEDA, G.R. No. L-19773, May 30, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Crispin Pineda was employed by the Manila Railroad Company (MRR) since 1936 as a trackman. His duties involved changing rails and ties, and filling tracks during washouts, exposing him to rain, heat, and stormy weather day and night. In November 1958, the MRR Medical Department found him suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, leading to his retirement for physical disability in December 1958. Pineda filed a claim for disability compensation. MRR argued that the illness was due to poor diet and sanitation, not employment, or should have been contracted earlier given his length of service. The Hearing Officer and the WCC Chairman dismissed the claim. However, the Commission *en banc* reversed the dismissal, ruling the illness compensable due to aggravation and noting MRR's failure to seasonably controvert the claim. MRR appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claimant's illness (tuberculosis) is compensable on the ground of aggravation.
2. W/N the petitioner has waived its right to dispute the claim due to failure to controvert on time.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the Commission's conclusion that the strenuous nature of Pineda's work aggravated his illness. The Court held that the law does not require employment to be the sole factor in the development of the disease; it is sufficient if the employment contributed, even in a small degree, to the illness [1]. The fact that Pineda did not suffer health impairment during his earlier years of service does not disprove the causal relation, as he was likely in the peak of health then, and his resistance eventually gave way to the continuous exposure to the elements [2].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that MRR failed to controvert the claim within the period prescribed by law. MRR knew of the illness on November 17, 1958, but failed to file a notice of controversion by December 1, 1958 (within 14 days) [3, 4]. Failure to comply with this requirement constitutes a renunciation of the right to dispute the claim's compensability [3].

Petition denied. Decision affirmed.
