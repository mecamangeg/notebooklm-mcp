**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF CEFERINO GO TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, CEFERINO GO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17774, May 30, 1964, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Ceferino Go, a single, 22-year-old Chinese citizen born in Zamboanga City, filed a petition for naturalization [1, 2]. He claimed to be a student taking marine engineering and simultaneously employed as a mechanic at United Sawmill, earning P120.00 per month [2]. The Court of First Instance of Zamboanga City granted his petition [1, 3]. The Solicitor General appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the petitioner failed to meet the statutory requirement of having a lucrative occupation [1, 4]. The evidence showed that Go’s alleged work hours conflicted with his school schedule, and his 1960 residence certificate reflected an annual income of only P1,152.00 [4, 5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner satisfies the statutory requirement of having a lucrative occupation.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the petitioner failed to prove he had a lucrative occupation. First, the Court found his employment doubtful because he could not explain how he worked four hours daily while maintaining a full-time school schedule from 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM [4]. Second, even assuming his employment was genuine, an annual income of P1,152.00 (less than P120.00 monthly) is not considered "lucrative" for naturalization purposes [5]. The Court cited established jurisprudence stating that even an income of P200.00 is insufficient considering the current purchasing power of the currency [5].

The judgment of the lower court is **REVERSED**, and the application for naturalization is **DENIED** [5].
