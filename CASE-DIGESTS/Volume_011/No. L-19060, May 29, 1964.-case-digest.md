I. CAPTION
IGNACIO GERONA, MARIA CONCEPCION GERONA, FRANCISCO GERONA and DELFIN GERONA v. CARMEN DE GUZMAN, JOSE DE GUZMAN, CLEMENTE DE GUZMAN, FRANCISCO DE GUZMAN, RUSTICA DE GUZMAN, PACITA DE GUZMAN and VICTORIA DE GUZMAN, G.R. No. L-19060, May 29, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners are the legitimate children of Placida de Guzman, a daughter of Marcelo de Guzman by his first marriage [1]. Respondents are the children of Marcelo de Guzman by his second marriage [2]. Marcelo died on September 11, 1945 [2]. On May 6, 1948, respondents executed a deed of extra-judicial settlement of Marcelo's estate, fraudulently claiming to be the sole heirs and excluding petitioners [2]. Consequently, respondents secured Transfer Certificates of Title in their own names [2].

On September 4, 1958, petitioners filed a complaint for annulment of the deed and reconveyance of their shares, claiming they discovered the fraud only the year before [1, 2]. Respondents argued the action was barred by the statute of limitations [3]. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription, a ruling affirmed by the Court of Appeals [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for reconveyance based on fraud has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Although an action for partition among co-heirs generally does not prescribe, this rule applies only as long as the defendants do not hold the property under an adverse title [4]. The statute of limitations operates from the moment adverse title is asserted by the possessor [4].

When respondents executed the deed of extra-judicial settlement excluding petitioners and secured new titles in their own names, they asserted a title adverse to the petitioners [5]. An action for reconveyance based on an implied trust resulting from fraud may be barred by the statute of limitations [5]. The action must be filed within four (4) years from the discovery of the fraud [5]. In this case, the discovery of fraud is deemed to have taken place on June 25, 1948, when the deed was registered and new titles were issued, as this constituted constructive notice to the whole world [5]. Since the complaint was filed in 1958, more than 10 years after the registration, the action has prescribed [6].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [7].
