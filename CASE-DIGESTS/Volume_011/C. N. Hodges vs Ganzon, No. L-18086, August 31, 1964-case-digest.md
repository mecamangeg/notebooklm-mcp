I. CAPTION
**C. N. HODGES and JOSE CUSTODIO v. THE HONORABLE RODOLFO GANZON, as City Mayor of the City of Iloilo**, G.R. No. L-18086, August 31, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jose Custodio purchased a building from petitioner C. N. Hodges on Ledesma Street, Iloilo City, which was formerly a refreshment parlor. Intending to convert it into a funeral parlor, Custodio applied for and received a building permit from the City Mayor's office. However, Respondent Mayor Rodolfo Ganzon stopped the work, determining that Custodio was undertaking "outright alterations" when the permit issued was only for "repairs." Additionally, Custodio’s application for a license to operate the funeral parlor was denied based on Municipal Board Resolution No. 545, which prohibited funeral parlors in that commercial zone. Petitioners filed a petition for *mandamus* in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo to compel the Mayor to issue the license and allow the construction work. The CFI dismissed the petition, upholding the validity of the resolution and the Mayor's actions.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N *mandamus* lies to compel the City Mayor to issue the permit to operate a funeral parlor and allow the building alterations.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the petition.

Regarding the construction work, the Court found that the permit issued (Exhibit E) was strictly for "repairs," as the words "construct" and "reconstruct" were explicitly crossed out [1]. Furthermore, the fee paid by Custodio (P25.00) corresponded only to repairs; a permit for alterations would have cost more than P50.00 [2]. Thus, the Mayor justifiably stopped the work because the actual construction (alterations) exceeded the scope of the permit granted [3, 4].

Regarding the license to operate, the Court held that Resolution No. 545 was a valid exercise of the municipal board's power to enact zoning regulations under the City Charter and the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. 2264) [4]. Even if the resolution were technically invalid for not being an ordinance, *mandamus* would still not lie. The Court ruled that when a law requires a permit, "a certain degree of discretion is lodged in the Mayor to grant it or not" [4]. *Mandamus* is only available to enforce clear legal duties, not discretionary acts. In denying the permit, the Mayor exercised his discretion in conformity with the municipal board's policy [4].

**Judgment affirmed.**
