**I. CAPTION**
PHILIPPINE LAND-AIR-SEA LABOR UNION (PLASLU) AND/OR JESUS STA. IGLESIA, ET AL. v. SY INDONG COMPANY RICE AND CORN MILL, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18476, May 30, 1964, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
On August 17, 1955, petitioners Philippine Land-Air-Sea Labor Union (PLASLU) and seven of its members (Jesus Sta. Iglesia, et al.) filed a complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP) in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against respondents Sy Indong Company Rice and Corn Mill (Sy Indong), Tubod Labor Union (TLU), and their respective officers [1]. The petitioners alleged that TLU officers coerced the individual complainants to resign from PLASLU under threat of harm, and that Sy Indong dismissed them due to their union affiliation [1].

On February 4, 1957, while the case was pending, Sy Indong sold its assets to Sen Chiong Rice & Corn Mill Co. (Sen Chiong), which was organized on that very same day [2]. The complaint was amended to include Sen Chiong and its manager, Ang Han Tiong, as respondents [2].

The CIR Trial Judge rendered a decision finding the respondents guilty of ULP and held that the transfer to Sen Chiong was made to evade liability. He ordered the partners of Sy Indong and Sen Chiong to reinstate the complainants with backwages [2-4]. However, the CIR *en banc* reversed this decision, ruling that: (1) the complainants who did not personally testify (Manulat, Taray, and the Gabins) were not entitled to relief because the case was not a class suit; and (2) Sen Chiong was a separate entity not liable for Sy Indong’s acts [5-7]. The petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the complainants who did not personally testify are entitled to reinstatement and backwages.
2. W/N Sen Chiong Rice & Corn Mill Co. can be held liable for the unfair labor practices of Sy Indong.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** In an unfair labor practice case, it is neither necessary nor imperative that all complainants personally testify and prove the charges [8]. The Supreme Court rejected the CIR *en banc*'s reliance on *Dimayuga v. CIR*, noting that unlike *Dimayuga*, the instant case was filed by the Union (PLASLU) on behalf of its members [9]. Under Republic Act No. 875, the CIR should not resort to technicalities in procedure or evidence [10]. The testimony of a few complainants corroborating the ULP charge is sufficient to grant relief to all affected members.

2. **YES.** Sen Chiong is liable as the successor-in-interest of Sy Indong. The Court found that Sen Chiong was organized on the exact same day the assets of Sy Indong were assigned to it [11]. Furthermore, the managing partner of Sy Indong (Ang Han Tiong) was also the manager of Sen Chiong, and the two companies shared common partners [7, 11]. Given that the ULP case had been pending for 18 months prior to the sale, the organizers of Sen Chiong were aware of the litigation [11, 12]. They either organized the new company to relieve the old one of the consequences of the litigation or acquired the assets assuming the risks of the liabilities involved [12]. Thus, the trial judge was justified in piercing the veil of corporate fiction.

**Disposition:** The Resolution appealed from is reversed and the decision of the trial Judge is affirmed and reinstated *in toto* [13].
