I. CAPTION
SHELL COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES, LTD. v. INSULAR PETROLEUM REFINING CO., LTD. and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-19441, June 30, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Shell Company (Shell) sells lubricating oil in containers bearing its trademark. Respondent Insular Petroleum (Insular) collects used oil, refines it, and sells it as "Insoil." Insular typically uses miscellaneous used drums (including Shell's) but obliterates the original markings before selling its low-grade oil [1]. In an isolated transaction, Insular’s agent sold one drum of Insoil to Uichangco, a Shell dealer, in a container where the "Shell" mark was not erased [1, 2]. Uichangco was aware he was buying Insoil, as the invoice explicitly stated "Insoil Motor Oil" and the agent made no misrepresentation that it was Shell oil [2, 3]. The purchase was actually directed by Shell’s management to secure evidence against Insular [2]. Shell filed a complaint for unfair competition. The Court of Appeals (CA) ruled in favor of Insular, finding no deception [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Insular committed unfair competition by selling its oil in a container bearing Shell's trademark in this isolated transaction.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the CA's finding that there was no unfair competition. Under Section 29 of Republic Act No. 166, the inherent element of unfair competition is fraud or deceit—specifically, the act of passing off one's goods as those of another [6].

The Court held that the "universal test" is whether the public is likely to be deceived [7]. In this case, there was no actual or probable deception because the specific buyer (Uichangco) knew he was purchasing Insular's oil, not Shell's, and the invoice correctly identified the product [8]. Furthermore, this was an isolated transaction where the product did not reach the ultimate consumer but was sold back to Shell for evidentiary purposes [9]. The Court distinguished this from cases where the competing product reaches the public in the offending container, stating that "the law of unfair competition does not protect purchasers against falsehood which the tradesman may tell; the falsehood must be told by the article itself" [10]. As Insular generally obliterated marks and did not attempt to pass off its goods as Shell's, no unfair competition existed [11].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [12].
