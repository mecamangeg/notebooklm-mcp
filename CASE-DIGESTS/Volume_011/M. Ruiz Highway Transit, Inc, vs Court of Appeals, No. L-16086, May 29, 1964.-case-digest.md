I. CAPTION
M. RUIZ HIGHWAY TRANSIT, INC. and MARTIN BUENA v. COURT OF APPEALS, GUILLERMO MONSERRAT, and MARTA CONSIGNADO, G.R. No. L-16086, May 29, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondents spouses Guillermo Monserrat and Marta Consignado, along with their four-year-old daughter Victoria, were paying passengers on a bus owned by petitioner M. Ruiz Highway Transit, Inc. and driven by petitioner Martin Buena. While the bus was in transit in Sta. Rosa, Laguna, a rear tire exploded, blasting a hole through the floor where the child was standing. Victoria fell through the hole and died from her injuries. [1-3]

The trial court dismissed the complaint for damages, ruling that the accident was an act of God and that the parents had discharged the carrier's liability through affidavits (Exhibits 2 and 3) expressing their belief that the company was not at fault. The Court of Appeals reversed this decision, finding that the petitioners failed to prove extraordinary diligence and that the affidavits did not constitute a valid waiver. [2, 4]

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the carrier is liable for the death of the passenger despite the tire blowout.
2. W/N the carrier’s liability was discharged by the affidavits signed by the victim's parents.
3. W/N moral damages may be awarded for a breach of contract of carriage resulting in death.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The petitioners failed to exercise the "utmost diligence of very cautious persons" required by Article 1755 of the New Civil Code. The death of the passenger reinforces the presumption under Article 1756 that the carrier neglected to provide a safe conveyance, which the petitioners failed to rebut. The Court of Appeals found persuasive indications of negligence, specifically that the bus was overcrowded, overspeeding, and had weak flooring. Even conceding that the tire blowout was accidental, the carrier is still liable for its failure to provide a safe floor, which directly caused the child to fall through. [3, 5]

2. **NO.** The affidavits (Exhibits 2 and 3) signed by the parents do not prove that the petitioners discharged their legal liability. These documents merely expressed the parents' erroneous belief that the carrier was not liable. The Court held that such belief was baseless and noted that the respondents were ignorant, illiterate, indigent, and thoroughly confused and distracted by the recent death of their child at the time of signing. [5]

3. **YES.** Under Articles 1764 and 2206 of the New Civil Code, a carrier is liable for moral damages to the parents of a child who dies while a passenger in the carrier's vehicle. The Court affirmed the award of indemnity, moral damages, and attorney's fees. [6]

**Decision affirmed.** [7]
