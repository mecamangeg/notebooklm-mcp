I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. NORTON & HARRISON COMPANY, G.R. No. L-17618, August 31, 1964, 120 Phil. 714, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Norton & Harrison Company (Norton) entered into an agreement with Jackbilt to market concrete blocks manufactured by the latter. In 1949, Norton purchased all outstanding shares of Jackbilt [1]. Following this, Norton constituted Jackbilt's board with its own officers, financed Jackbilt's operations, paid the salaries of Jackbilt's employees, and shared the same office compound [2-4].

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed Norton for deficiency sales tax and surcharges amounting to P32,662.90 for the period from 1949 to 1953 [1]. The CIR disregarded Jackbilt’s separate corporate personality, contending it was a mere adjunct of Norton, and based the assessment on Norton's sales to the public rather than the transfer price from Jackbilt to Norton [5]. Norton appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), which ruled in its favor, holding that Norton was merely an agent of Jackbilt and that the tax should be assessed against Jackbilt as the manufacturer [6, 7]. The CIR appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the separate corporate personality of Jackbilt should be disregarded for sales tax purposes, making Norton liable for taxes based on sales to the public.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CTA decision. The Court held that while ownership of all stocks of a corporation by another does not necessarily destroy separate personality, the circumstances in this case justified piercing the corporate veil [2].

The Court found that Jackbilt was merely an adjunct, business conduit, or *alter ego* of Norton based on the following: (a) Norton owned all outstanding stocks of Jackbilt; (b) Jackbilt's board was constituted by Norton to enable actual control (common officers); (c) Norton financed Jackbilt's operations; (d) Norton treated Jackbilt employees as its own; and (e) compensation for Jackbilt’s board members was negligible, indicating they were paid through their Norton positions [2, 3].

Citing *Liddell & Co. v. Collector of Internal Revenue*, the Court ruled that revenue officers may disregard separate corporate entities when they serve as a shield for tax evasion [8]. The Court noted that maintaining separate entities allowed Norton to pay lower income taxes [9]. Consequently, the sales tax must be based on the sales to the public by Norton, the entity actually reaping the benefits of the transactions [10-12].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **REVERSED**, and Norton & Harrison Company is declared liable for the deficiency sales taxes plus a 25% surcharge [13].
