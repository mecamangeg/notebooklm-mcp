I. CAPTION
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, ET AL. v. KAPISANAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA SA MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19728, July 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On June 15, 1961, a prosecutor of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) filed a complaint for unfair labor practice against petitioners Manila Railroad Company on behalf of certain employees. These employees were pre-war bus washers or truck helpers of the Benguet Auto Line who had served the company for over 20 years [1, 2]. The complaint alleged that petitioners refused to classify them as permanent employees because of their affiliation with the respondent union, Kapisanan ng mga Manggagawa, and their union activities [1].

Petitioners argued that the complainants were merely casual laborers subject to the company's needs and that there were no vacant permanent positions in the budget [3, 4]. However, the CIR found that between 1957 and 1959, the company hired four new employees for the same positions and immediately granted them permanent status [4]. The CIR rendered a decision finding the petitioners guilty of unfair labor practice and ordered them to accord permanent status to the complainants [5]. The CIR *en banc* denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration, prompting this petition for review [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners committed unfair labor practice by refusing to grant permanent status to the complainants due to their union affiliation.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's decision. The Court found that the complainants were pre-war employees with over 20 years of service and no record of improper behavior [2, 4]. Their positions did not require Civil Service eligibility or special educational qualifications [2].

The Court rejected the petitioners' defense regarding the lack of vacancies, noting that new hires in 1957 and 1959 were immediately given permanent appointments while the complainants remained casuals [4]. This disparity in treatment demonstrated discrimination. The Court held that where employees are qualified and have long service records, "the refusal of their employer to give them permanent appointments because of their union affiliation is considered as an unfair labor practice" [2, 6].

The petition was denied and the decision appealed from was affirmed [7].
