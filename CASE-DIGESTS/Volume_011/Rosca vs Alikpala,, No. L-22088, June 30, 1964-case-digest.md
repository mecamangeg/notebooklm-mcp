I. CAPTION
CELESTINO C. ROSCA, ET AL. v. HON. FEDERICO C. ALIKPALA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22088, June 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, officers of the Caloocan City Police Department, filed a petition for prohibition and injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against the Acting Commissioner of Civil Service and various Caloocan City officials (Mayor, Treasurer, etc.) [1]. This action arose after the Commissioner terminated petitioners' services for refusing to take new qualifying examinations, a directive the Caloocan officials implemented [1].

On August 5, 1963, the CFI issued a preliminary mandatory injunction ordering both the Commissioner and the Caloocan officials to restore petitioners to their positions and pay their salaries [2]. However, on August 9, 1963, the court *motu proprio* modified the order, eliminating the directive against the Caloocan officials [3]. The lower court ruled it lacked the power to enforce mandatory directives outside its territorial jurisdiction (Manila) [3, 4]. Petitioners filed this petition for certiorari to nullify the August 9 modification and reinstate the order against the Caloocan officials [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N it is necessary for the CFI of Manila to issue a mandatory injunction against the Caloocan City officials (outside its territorial jurisdiction) to effectuate the petitioners' reinstatement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that it was unnecessary to resolve the question of whether the lower court had authority to enforce its mandatory directive beyond its territorial jurisdiction [5, 6]. The record showed that the Caloocan City officials terminated the petitioners' services merely in obedience to the directive issued by the Civil Service Commissioner [6].

The CFI maintained its mandatory injunction against the Commissioner—who is within the court's territorial jurisdiction—ordering him to restore the petitioners to their positions [6]. Consequently, the Commissioner has no alternative but to recall the termination letters he addressed to the Caloocan officials [6]. The Court ruled that a separate mandatory directive against the Caloocan officials was therefore "ineffective and superfluous," as the desired relief is achieved through the order binding the Commissioner [6].

Petition dismissed [7].
