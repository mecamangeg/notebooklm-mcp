I. CAPTION
MAUYAG MATANOG v. HON. CRISTOBAL ALEJANDRO, THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF MARANTAO, DECAMPONG COMO, and COTA CORNEL, G.R. Nos. L-28502-03, June 30, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Following the November 12, 1963 elections for Mayor of Marantao, Lanao del Sur, petitioner Mauyag Matanog filed a petition for Judicial Recount (Special Civil Action No. 1292) regarding Precinct No. 9. Matanog claimed that the Board of Inspectors unlawfully increased the votes of respondent Cota Cornel from 157 to 297 in the election return (Exhibit K) and that the return was prepared irregularly outside the polling place. To support his claim of discrepancy, Matanog presented Tally Boards (Exhibits J and J-1), a certificate of votes given to a watcher, and a certificate executed by a Constabulary (PC) officer.

The Court of First Instance denied the petition for judicial recount. The lower court found that the Tally Boards were not signed by the members of the board of inspectors, were incomplete, and were not public documents, making them susceptible to substitution. In contrast, the court found the election return (Exhibit K) to be regular on its face, without alterations or erasures. Matanog filed a petition for Certiorari with the Supreme Court, alleging the lower court acted with grave abuse of discretion.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a judicial recount is warranted based on discrepancies between an election return and documents such as unsigned tally boards, a certificate of votes issued to a watcher, or a certificate executed by a PC officer.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition. Citing *Municipal Board of Canvassers v. Benitez* and *Parlade v. Quicho*, the Court held that the remedy of judicial recount under Sections 163 and 168 of the Revised Election Code is authorized only when there are contradictions or discrepancies between different "authentic copies" of the *same election return* (e.g., copies for the Municipal Treasurer, Provincial Treasurer, or COMELEC).

The Court ruled that the documents presented by the petitioner—specifically the certificate of votes given to a watcher and the certificate executed by a PC officer—are "not those which can be considered authentic copies of the election return" within the purview of the law. Furthermore, the lower court correctly disregarded the tally boards as they were unsigned and not public documents. Since there was no contradiction between the official election return (Exhibit K) and another authentic copy thereof, the lower court correctly denied the judicial recount. The Court further noted that even if the lower court's findings of fact were erroneous, they would not be correctible by certiorari absent a showing of grave abuse of discretion.
