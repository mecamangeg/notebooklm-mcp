**I. CAPTION**
GERTRUDES MANALO VDA. DE RIVAS, NORMANDO RIVAS, BERNARDO RIVAS, JR. and TITO RIVAS v. FRANCISCO ALAS and ROMAN ALAS, G.R. No. L-16930, July 31, 1964, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners (plaintiffs) previously filed Civil Case No. R-489 against respondents (defendants) for recovery of ownership of a property and damages [1]. In that complaint, petitioners explicitly prayed for P1,000.00 in damages and an additional P100.00 every three months during the pendency of the action [1]. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Maasin declared petitioners the owners but awarded only P246.25 as *daños y perjuicios* [2]. Respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the decision *in toto* [3]. During the appeal, respondent Francisco Alas retained possession and fruits of the land until May 15, 1955 [3].

Petitioners subsequently filed the instant case in the Justice of the Peace Court of Hinunangan, claiming P720.00 as their share of fruits accrued during the pendency of the appeal in the first case [3, 4]. The Justice of the Peace ruled in favor of petitioners [5]. On appeal, the CFI of Maasin dismissed the complaint on the ground of *res judicata*, ruling that the damages sought had already been adjudicated in the prior case [6, 7]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court [7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the subsequent action for damages accrued during the pendency of the appeal in the prior case is barred by *res judicata*.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court held that the claim for damages is barred because it had already been passed upon in the former case [8]. In the previous litigation, petitioners expressly asked for damages accruing at the time of the complaint plus P100.00 every three months thereafter [8]. Despite this specific prayer, the trial court awarded a fixed sum of P246.25 without condition, reservation, or qualification as to the period it covered [8].

The Court applied the principle that a judgment is conclusive not only as to the matter actually determined but as to every other matter the parties might have litigated and had decided incident to the subject matter [9]. Since the judgment in the first case was affirmed without qualification and became final, it is presumed that the award covered all values assessed by the court [8]. Petitioners should have appealed the portion of the first decision denying the rest of their claim; having failed to do so, they cannot litigate the same issue again [8, 10].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed [10].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Regala, and Makalintal concurred with the decision [10].
