I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. HAWAIIAN-PHILIPPINE COMPANY, G.R. No. L-16315, May 30, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Hawaiian-Philippine Company operates a sugar central in Silay, Occidental Negros, producing centrifugal sugar from planters' sugarcane [1]. The sugar is deposited in respondent’s warehouses, for which it issues warehouse receipts or "quedans" [1, 2]. Storage is free for the first 90 days, but thereafter, respondent charges storage fees [2]. From 1949 to 1957, respondent's gross receipts from this activity amounted to P212,853.00 [3]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed fixed and percentage taxes on this storage business [4]. Respondent paid under protest and filed a claim for refund, arguing it is not a warehouseman and that the storage is merely incidental to its milling business [3, 4]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled in favor of respondent and ordered the refund of P8,411.99 [4]. The CIR petitioned the Supreme Court for review [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N respondent is a warehouseman liable for fixed and percentage taxes under the National Internal Revenue Code.
2. W/N the imposition of said taxes constitutes prohibited double taxation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that respondent is a warehouseman. A warehouseman is defined as one who receives and stores goods of another for compensation [5]. While the first 90 days are free, the undisputed fact is that respondent collects fees after said period [3]. Under Section 2 of the General Bonded Warehouse Act, a warehouseman is "a person engaged in the business of receiving commodity for storage" [5]. The fact that the business is conducted in relation to the sugar central operations does not exempt it, as Section 178 of the Tax Code provides that tax is payable for every distinct establishment or line of business [6].

2. **NO.** The Court held that there is no double taxation because the warehousing business is distinct and separate from the sugar central operation [7]. Furthermore, the Court cited *Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. v. Meer* to reiterate that there is no constitutional prohibition against double or multiple taxation in this jurisdiction [7].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **REVERSED** and set aside [8].
