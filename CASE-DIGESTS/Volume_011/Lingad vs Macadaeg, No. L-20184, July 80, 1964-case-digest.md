I. CAPTION
**JOSE B. LINGAD, as the Commissioner of Customs and PEDRO PACIS, as Acting Collector of Customs, Manila v. HON. HIGINIO B. MACADAEG and AGRO INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS, INC.,** G.R. No. L-20184, June 30, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In a previous decision (*Climaco v. Macadaeg*, G.R. No. L-19440, April 18, 1962), the Supreme Court upheld the right of respondent Agro Industrial Products, Inc. (Agro) to import Virginia tobacco under terms set by the President in 1961 and declared Agro’s 1961 import entries valid [1], [2]. To execute this, the parties signed an "Implementation Agreement" on June 7, 1962, allowing Agro to transfer the tobacco to bonded warehouses to reduce storage costs [1], [3]. However, petitioners Commissioner of Customs Lingad and Collector Pacis refused to allow the transfer unless Agro filed new warehousing entries and paid 1962 duty rates, arguing the agreement required compliance with customs regulations [4], [5]. The Court of First Instance of Manila (Judge Macadaeg) issued an order commanding the immediate transfer without new entries, ruling that the demand was a "superfluous technicality" intended to delay the release [5], [6]. Petitioners filed a writ of certiorari, claiming the lower court disregarded the Tariff and Customs Code [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Customs officials may require the filing of new warehousing entries for goods covered by consumption entries previously declared valid by the Supreme Court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the petition, holding that the original consumption entries tendered by Agro in 1961 had already been declared valid and improperly rejected in the final decision of G.R. No. L-19440 [2]. The Court reasoned that the Customs and Tariff Code does not demand or authorize the duplication of customs entries for identical merchandise [2]. Requiring new warehousing entries would effectively invalidate the 1961 entries and allow Customs officers to circumvent a final decision of the highest tribunal [8], [9]. The stipulation in the Implementation Agreement regarding compliance with customs rules cannot be construed to require new entries, as this would sabotage the effect of the Court's prior judgment [8]. The transfer to bonded warehouses was based on the special agreement, not solely on the Code, making the demand for new entries unnecessary [2].

**Petition for certiorari is DENIED.** [10]
