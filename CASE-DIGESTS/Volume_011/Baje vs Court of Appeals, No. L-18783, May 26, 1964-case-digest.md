**I. CAPTION**
GENEROSO BAJE and SATURNINA SACDALAN v. COURT OF APPEALS, CRISTINA VALDEZ, et al., G.R. No. L-18783, May 26, 1964, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
On June 17, 1932, Marcelo Valdez was issued a homestead patent for four parcels of land in Nueva Vizcaya [1]. In 1933 and 1935, within the five-year prohibitory period against alienation, Valdez sold the land to petitioners Generoso Baje and Saturnina Sacdalan [2]. Valdez later died. His heirs (respondents) demanded the return of the land in 1936, 1940, and 1946, but petitioners refused [2]. On March 23, 1953, the heirs filed a complaint for recovery [3].

The Court of First Instance dismissed the action on the ground of laches [2]. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the dismissal, declaring the sale null and void *ab initio* for violation of the Public Land Act [3]. The CA ordered the cancellation of petitioners' title and the return of the land with damages [4]. However, the CA denied petitioners' motion for the refund of the P3,734 purchase price, ruling that under *Labrador v. De los Santos*, the heirs were not personally liable and petitioners must file a claim in the estate proceedings [5, 6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the heirs must refund the purchase price to the buyers before they can recover the homestead sold in violation of the 5-year prohibitory period.
2. W/N the petitioners are entitled to reimbursement for alleged improvements.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the doctrine in *Labrador v. De los Santos* and *Castro v. Orpiano* is deemed revoked [7, 8]. While the sale of a homestead within five years from the issuance of the patent is null and void, the principle that no one should enrich themselves at the expense of another applies [9, 10]. This is a case of mutual restitution incident to the nullity *ab initio* of the conveyance [10]. The heirs cannot demand the return of possession unless they comply with their reciprocal obligation to refund the purchase price paid by the petitioners [8]. Consequently, the petitioners are not bound to pay damages until the heirs reimburse the sum of P3,734 [11].

2. **NO.** The expenses incurred by petitioners were not necessary for the preservation of the land and did not constitute improvements [8]. They were merely expenses of production, which have already been compensated by the products and harvest petitioners received from the land while in possession [8].

**Disposition:** The decision is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioners' title shall be cancelled and a new one issued to respondents, but respondents are entitled to possession only upon reimbursement of P3,734 to petitioners. No damages are awarded until such reimbursement is made [11, 12].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Justices Reyes, J.B.L. and Regala took no part) [13].
