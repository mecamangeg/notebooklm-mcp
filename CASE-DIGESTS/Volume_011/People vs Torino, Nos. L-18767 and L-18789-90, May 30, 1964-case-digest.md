**I. CAPTION**
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MADRIGAL TORINO**, G.R. Nos. L-18767 and L-18789-90, May 30, 1964, 11 SCRA 288, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Madrigal Torino was charged in the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Norte with three separate crimes committed on different dates against different persons: (1) Robbery in band with homicide (Crim. Case No. 3111), (2) Robbery (Crim. Case No. 3138), and (3) Robbery in band with serious physical injuries (Crim. Case No. 3266/3268). The trial court consolidated the cases because Torino raised the same defense of alibi in all three, claiming he had fled to Lanao to escape his brothers who had killed their father.

In Case 3111, spouses Pio Ching and Eustiquia Dawat identified Torino, who was unmasked and illuminated by a lamp, as the one who robbed them; their neighbor Alfredo Ocao was killed during the incident. In Case 3138, members of the Velez family identified Torino despite his mask, recognizing his voice and build as he was their neighbor. In the third case, witnesses Francisca Busca and Jovencio Agad identified him.

The trial court convicted Torino in a joint decision. Torino appealed, questioning his identification and relying on an affidavit of recantation executed by prosecution witness Pablo Martillano after the conviction.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over the positive identification by the prosecution witnesses.
2. W/N the post-conviction affidavit of recantation by a prosecution witness warrants a reversal.
3. W/N the penalty imposed for Robbery in band with serious physical injuries (third case) was correct.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The defense of alibi cannot be entertained when the identification of the accused has been sufficiently established by a number of worthy witnesses. In Case 3111, the witnesses saw the accused clearly without a mask under bright light. In Case 3138, the witnesses recognized the accused, a neighbor, by his voice and physique despite the mask. In the third case, witnesses had ample opportunity to observe him. There was no motive for these witnesses to falsely impute such grave wrongs to the appellant.

2. **NO.** An affidavit of recantation made by a prosecution witness after the conviction of the accused is unreliable and deserves scant consideration (*People v. Manigbas*; *People v. Tiongson*). Martillano’s testimony was merely corroborative, and the identity of the appellant had already been sufficiently established by other worthy witnesses.

3. **NO.** The lower court penalized the third crime under Article 294, subdivision 4 of the Revised Penal Code. The Supreme Court ruled it should fall under **subdivision 5** of the same Article. Since the crime was committed by a band and there were no mitigating circumstances, the penalty is imposed in its maximum degree.

**Decision affirmed with modification on the penalty in the third criminal case.**
