I. CAPTION
**LU DO & LU YM CORPORATION v. PHILIPPINE LAND-AIR-SEA LABOR UNION (PLASLU) and the PROGRESSIVE EMPLOYEES AND LABORERS UNION (PELU)**, G.R. No. L-18450, May 29, 1984, 11 SCRA 135.

II. FACTS
The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) initially ordered petitioner Lu Do & Lu Ym Corporation to pay its employees 25% additional compensation for work rendered on Sundays and legal holidays. The CIR examiner, Felipe Terso, calculated the amount due as P8,413.93 for the period from 1952 to 1954. This computation was based on payroll records marked with an "x", which the examiner assumed represented eight hours of work because no time cards were available [1], [2].

The petitioner opposed the report, arguing that employees worked only six hours on Sundays and holidays but were paid the equivalent of eight hours, thus already receiving the extra compensation. The petitioner presented 20 witnesses who testified positively to this arrangement. The CIR Trial Judge (Martinez) sustained the petitioner's opposition and disapproved the examiner's report, finding the company's witnesses "positive, firm and uniform" compared to the union's conflicting evidence [3], [4].

However, the CIR *en banc* reversed the Trial Judge's decision and ordered the payment of P8,413.93. The *en banc* resolution reasoned that since the company admitted "x" meant eight hours for its guards, it should mean the same for other employees, and doubted the witnesses' memory of past working hours [5], [6]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR *en banc* findings of fact, which reversed the Trial Judge based on inference rather than evidence, are binding on the Supreme Court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the CIR *en banc* resolution. While findings of the CIR are generally conclusive, they are not binding when unsupported by substantial or credible proof [7], [8].

The Court held that the CIR *en banc* erred in disregarding the "positive, firm and uniform" testimony of 20 witnesses who declared they worked only six hours but were paid for eight [9]. The *en banc* relied on a mere inference that because "x" meant eight hours for guards, it must mean the same for 250 other employees [10]. The Court ruled that this inference was not strong enough to overcome the probative force of the affirmative testimony presented by the petitioner. Affirmative testimony is stronger than the negative testimony of the examiner who merely assumed the meaning of the "x" mark [10]. Consequently, the Trial Judge's findings were reinstated as they were supported by evidence, unlike the *en banc*'s conjecture [11].

**Resolution set aside.**
