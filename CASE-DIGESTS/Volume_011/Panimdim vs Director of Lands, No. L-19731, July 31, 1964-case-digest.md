I. CAPTION
ESTANISLAO PANIMDIM v. THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19731, July 31, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Estanislao Panimdim succeeded to the rights of his predecessor-in-interest over a parcel of land. On July 8, 1957, a free patent was issued in Panimdim's name, followed by the issuance of Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 9040 by the Register of Deeds of Camarines Sur [1].

Subsequently, respondent Mariano De la Rosa filed a protest, claiming Panimdim was entitled to a smaller area. Acting on this protest, the Director of Lands ordered a new investigation. On August 24, 1959—more than two years after the title was issued—the Director rendered a decision declaring the patent "legally wrong and improper" and ordered administrative action to amend and reduce the patent area [2, 3]. Panimdim moved to dismiss, arguing the Director had lost jurisdiction because the land was no longer public domain. The Motion was denied, and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources affirmed the Director's decision [4]. Panimdim filed a petition for certiorari [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Director of Lands retains jurisdiction to amend or set aside a free patent after the certificate of title has been issued and registered.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that once a free patent is registered and the corresponding certificate of title is issued, the land ceases to be part of the public domain and becomes private property [6]. Consequently, the Director of Lands loses control and jurisdiction over the land [7].

Citing *Republic v. Heirs of Ciriaco Carle* and *Sumail v. Judge*, the Court emphasized that a certificate of title issued pursuant to a homestead or free patent partakes of the nature of a certificate issued in a judicial proceeding [8]. It becomes indefeasible and incontrovertible upon the expiration of one year from the date of issuance [8]. In this case, the Director of Lands attempted to amend the patent more than two years after the registration of the patent and issuance of the title; thus, he was already barred from doing so [3]. The proper remedy for a party injured by fraudulent registration is an ordinary action for reconveyance, not an administrative amendment [3].

Petition GRANTED. The decision of the Director of Lands is SET ASIDE [5].
