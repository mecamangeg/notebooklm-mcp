**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. NICOMEDES CASTRO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17465, August 31, 1964, Per Curiam.

**II. FACTS**
On July 21, 1959, at around 7:30 PM, Mayor Lucio Zabala and his wife Petra Serna were eating dinner at their home in Cabugao, Ilocos Sur, when two armed men entered and shot them dead [1, 2]. Luzvimin Zabala, the mayor's daughter who was present, identified Nicomedes Castro as one of the gunmen [3, 4]. Castro, Godofredo Basuel, and Rufino Cinco were arrested and executed extrajudicial confessions admitting their participation—Castro and Basuel as gunmen, and Cinco as the lookout—pursuant to a plan hatched with others [5-7]. The accused retracted their confessions during the trial, claiming they were extracted through torture, maltreatment, and "water cure" by the Constabulary and CIS agents [8]. They also interposed alibis. The Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur convicted them of double murder and imposed the death sentence [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the extrajudicial confessions are admissible despite the accused's claims of torture and involuntariness.
2. W/N there was conspiracy among the accused.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the confessions were voluntary and admissible. The statements were replete with details that the police could not have known, such as the specific command "Icammo!" (give it to him!), the disposal of the weapon in a specific yard (which agents searched in vain, proving they didn't plant the story), and the wanderings of the group [9, 10]. Furthermore, the voluntariness was evidenced by the firmness of the signatures, the failure of the accused to complain to the swearing officers, and the written denials of force appended to the documents [9, 11]. Medical examinations requested by the accused revealed scars that were either healed or inconsistent with the alleged manner of torture, failing to corroborate their claims [8, 11]. The Court reiterated that the burden to prove involuntariness rests on the accused [12].

2. **YES.** Conspiracy was established by the concerted action of the accused. The records showed they went to the victim's house armed and together; while one stayed as a lookout, the other two entered and shot the mayor and his wife, and they departed together [13, 14]. This conduct admits no other rational explanation but conspiracy, rendering each accused responsible for the acts of the others, consistent with the ruling in *People v. Upao* [14].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed; however, for lack of sufficient votes, the death penalty is reduced to *reclusion perpetua* [15].
