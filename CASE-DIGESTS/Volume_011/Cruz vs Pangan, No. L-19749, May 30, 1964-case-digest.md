I. CAPTION
MONICO CRUZ v. CAMILO PANGAN and SOTERA (PANGAN) SANTIAGO, G.R. No. L-19749, May 30, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Camilo Pangan and Sotera Santiago were share tenants on a 3-hectare land in Bulacan owned by Leonila Tiongson [1]. In December 1959, Pangan filed a petition demanding a change in the sharing arrangement from 50-50 to 70-30 [1]. Tiongson moved to dismiss, claiming she had sold the land to petitioner Monico Cruz in September 1958 [1]. Concurrently, Cruz filed a petition to eject Pangan, alleging he purchased the land and intended to personally cultivate it [2].

The Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) initially granted Cruz authority to eject Pangan [2]. However, upon Pangan's motion for reconsideration, the CAR set aside its judgment [3]. It found that the sale was tainted with bad faith, noting that Tiongson had threatened to eject Pangan after his demand for better sharing, and that the 3-hectare lot sold to Cruz was suspiciously located in the middle of Tiongson's larger 22-hectare estate [4]. The CAR denied the ejectment and granted Pangan's request for the 70-30 sharing basis [5]. Cruz appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the tenant may be dispossessed by the new owner on the ground of personal cultivation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations. The Court held that the dispossession of a tenant on the ground of personal cultivation is invalid when the new owner's purchase of the land is tainted with bad faith [6].

The Court sustained the findings that Cruz conspired with the former owner, Tiongson, to deprive Pangan of possession after the tenant sought a 70-30 sharing basis [5, 6]. The Court found the sale suspicious because the small land in dispute was located in the middle of the former landlord's bigger tract of land [5, 6]. A tenant's petition for a change in the tenancy system cannot be defeated by a change in ownership aimed at personal cultivation if such change is tainted with *mala fide* [4, 7]. The decision appealed from was affirmed [8].
