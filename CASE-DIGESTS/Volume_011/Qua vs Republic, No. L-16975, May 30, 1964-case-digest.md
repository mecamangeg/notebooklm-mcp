I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, ROMULO QUA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16975, May 30, 1964, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Romulo Qua applied for naturalization, but the Philippine Army Headquarters objected, citing unfavorable intelligence regarding subversive activities [1]. The trial court initially denied the petition, but the Supreme Court remanded the case for a new trial to allow both parties to present evidence regarding these confidential reports [1, 2]. During the new trial, the Government presented a confidential report from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (G-2) stating that Qua was a leader and active commander of *Hiat Kan Tuan*, a Chinese guerilla unit affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party [3]. The report further revealed that he worked as a clerk for the group and resided at its headquarters on Soler Street, Manila [3]. Consequently, the trial court again denied the petition on March 24, 1960, prompting Qua to appeal to the Supreme Court [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the confidential army report linking the petitioner to the Chinese Communist Party is sufficient ground to deny his naturalization.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the denial of the petition. The Court held that the confidential army report was correctly admitted in evidence as the facts therein were entered by a public officer in the performance of his duties [5]. The report established that the petitioner was a leader of *Hiat Kan Tuan*, the most active guerilla unit affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party, and that he resided at the group's headquarters [3, 5]. These facts constitute sufficient ground to deny his petition to become a Filipino citizen [6, 7].

The decree appealed from is affirmed [7].
