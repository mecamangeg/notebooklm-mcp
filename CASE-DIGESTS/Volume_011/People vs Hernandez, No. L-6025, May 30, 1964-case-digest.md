I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AMADO V. HERNANDEZ, ET AL.**, G.R. Nos. L-6025 & L-6026, May 30, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Amado V. Hernandez was the President of the Congress of Labor Organizations (CLO), a labor union alleged by the prosecution to be an instrumentality of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). The prosecution claimed the CLO cooperated with the Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan (HMB), the armed force of the CPP, to overthrow the government. Hernandez and others were charged with Rebellion with Multiple Murder, Arson, and Robberies. The lower court convicted Hernandez, ruling that his presidency of the CLO and advocacy of Communism made him a principal in the rebellion. Hernandez appealed, arguing that his activities were merely political and propaganda-based, and that he refused to go "underground" or take up arms when other CPP leaders did. Other appellants included lower-ranking members who acted as couriers or solicited funds.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N mere membership in the Communist Party or the CLO, and the advocacy of Communism, constitutes conspiracy to commit rebellion.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that mere membership in the Communist Party or the CLO does not *per se* render a person liable for rebellion or conspiracy to commit rebellion. The advocacy of Communism is not criminal unless it is transformed into an advocacy of action, such as an actual agreement to start an uprising or the use of force.

The Court distinguished between a "theorist" who believes in the supremacy of the proletariat and a "conspirator" who advocates immediate uprising. Hernandez’s activities—making speeches, issuing press releases, and presiding over the CLO—were acts of propaganda. The Court found no evidence that he participated in the deliberations to go underground or conspired to use force. In fact, he refused to go underground, preferring to engage in the "legal battle." Citing *Scales v. United States*, the Court emphasized that guilt is personal and mere membership in an organization engaged in illegal advocacy is insufficient without proof of specific intent to further the illegal aims by action.

However, for appellants **Julian Lumanog, Fermin Rodillas, Bayani Espiritu, and Teopista Valerio**, the Court found them guilty of **Conspiracy to Commit Rebellion** (Art. 136, RPC). Their acts went beyond membership: they solicited contributions for the HMB, acted as couriers, or were members of the HMB (armed wing) itself, which implies an agreement to use force.

**Disposition:** Judgment modified. Hernandez, Juan J. Cruz, Amado Racanday, and Genaro de la Cruz are **ACQUITTED**. Lumanog, Rodillas, Espiritu, and Valerio are convicted of Conspiracy to Commit Rebellion.
