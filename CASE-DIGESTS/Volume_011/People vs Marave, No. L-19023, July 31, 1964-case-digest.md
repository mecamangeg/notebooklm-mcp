I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PROVINCIAL FISCAL MARTIN PAULATE, and SPECIAL PROSECUTOR VICENTE ORENDAIN, JR. v. HON. GERONIMO MARAVE, Judge of the CFI of Sulu, PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR OF SULU, BENJAMIN R. ABUBAKAR, et al., G.R. No. L-19023, July 31, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On June 15, 1961, Sulu Governor Benjamin Abubakar, accompanied by the Assistant Provincial Warden and PC soldiers, closed the office of the Special Counsel by nailing bamboo splits over it, citing the Provincial Board's abolition of the position [1, 2]. Provincial Fiscal Martin Paulate objected, asserting that his office was under the Department of Justice, but the Governor threatened physical violence if he interfered [2]. Consequently, an information for direct assault with grave coercion was filed against the Governor and his companions [3].

After preliminary investigation, respondent Judge Marave issued an order on August 29, 1961, stating that the Governor lacked the intent to commit assault as he believed he was authorized to close the office [4]. The Judge noted that if the Governor lacked authority, the crime might be coercion, but found no evidence linking the other accused [5]. The Judge directed the Special Prosecutor to "act accordingly within ten days," warning that failure to do so would result in the dismissal of the case [6]. Treating this order as an effective acquittal or dismissal without trial, the petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus, alleging grave abuse of discretion [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion warranting the issuance of a writ of certiorari.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petition for certiorari was premature [8, 9]. The order complained of was not an actual dismissal but merely insinuated that the Judge would dismiss the case if the Special Prosecutor failed to "act accordingly" [6, 9]. The Court ruled that the Judge might yet change his mind regarding the threatened dismissal [8].

Furthermore, the Court explained that grave abuse of discretion justifies a writ of certiorari only when there is a "capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction," or when power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner due to passion or hostility [10, 11]. The Court found none of these circumstances present, noting the order simply gave the Special Prosecutor leeway to act as he deemed proper given the case's stage [11]. The Prosecutor should have either acted upon the order or waited for the court's final action before seeking judicial review [12].

The petition is dismissed and the preliminary injunction dissolved [12].
