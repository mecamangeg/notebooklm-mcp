**I. CAPTION**
**SATURNINA HOLLERO and JOSE CAMENO v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, JOSE HOLLERO, ANITA HARDER, ISAGANI EVANGELISTA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16579, June 29, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.**

**II. FACTS**
The subject property is a parcel of land in Jaro, Iloilo, which was the paraphernal property of Paz Hollero [1]. Paz died in 1935, leaving her husband Generoso and their only son Felix. Felix died in 1944, followed shortly by Generoso [1].

Respondents (brothers, nephews, and nieces of Paz) claimed the property via *reserva troncal* [2]. They argued the land passed from Paz to Felix, then to Generoso by operation of law, and upon Generoso's death, it should revert to Paz's relatives within the third degree [2]. Petitioners (heirs of Generoso) contended that Generoso acquired the land by purchase, not inheritance. They claimed Paz sold the land to Andrea Gustilo in 1934 *con pacto de retro*, and Generoso repurchased it in 1936, thereby acquiring distinct ownership [3].

The Court of Appeals (CA) ruled that the 1934 transaction was an equitable mortgage, not a sale, and that Generoso merely repaid the debt [4]. Thus, the property was inherited by Felix and then Generoso, making it subject to *reserva troncal* [4]. However, the CA awarded portions of the land to Manuel Hollero and Felix Harder [5]. Petitioners appealed, arguing inter alia that these two individuals were excluded from the complaint and had previously acknowledged petitioners' rights in a prior ejectment case [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the transaction between Paz Hollero and Andrea Gustilo was a sale or an equitable mortgage.
2. W/N the Court of Appeals erred in awarding shares of the property to Manuel Hollero and Felix Harder, who were not parties to the case.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the character of the document—whether a sale or a mere mortgage—is a question of fact [6]. The Court of Appeals' pronouncement that the transaction was an equitable mortgage is final and forecloses the issue [4]. Consequently, the property is subject to *reserva troncal* [4].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled it was error to award parts of the land to persons expressly excluded from the complaint [7]. The complaint stated that Manuel Hollero and Felix Harder were not plaintiffs because they had relinquished their rights to the defendants (petitioners herein) [5]. Furthermore, in a prior ejectment suit (Civil Case No. 2239), petitioners had already defeated these individuals, who acknowledged petitioners' ownership [5].

Therefore, the shares corresponding to Manuel Hollero (1/6 or 4/24) and Felix Harder (1/24) must be awarded to the petitioners [8]. The SC modified the distribution: Jose Hollero (4/24), Severo Hollero (4/24), heirs of Socorro (3/24), heirs of Estrella (4/24), heirs of Benjamin (4/24), and petitioners Saturnina Hollero and Jose Cameno (5/24) [9].

The decision of the Court of Appeals was **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**, remanding the case to the lower court for partition [10].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, and Regala concurred. Justices Labrador, Barrera, Dizon, and Makalintal took no part [11].
