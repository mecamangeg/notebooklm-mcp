**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LORENZANA YUMANG, G.R. No. L-19569, May 30, 1964, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
On November 17, 1955, Lorenzana Yumang received eight pieces of jewelry valued at P1,273.00 from Asuncion Rodriguez at the latter's residence in Quezon City. The agreement was for Yumang to sell the items on a commission basis and return the proceeds or the jewelry within one month. The receipt expressly prohibited Yumang from entrusting the jewelry to third persons. Yumang failed to return the items upon demand. She admitted to Rodriguez that she had pawned the jewelry in a pawnshop in Manila without the complainant's permission. The Court of First Instance of Manila convicted Yumang of estafa. Yumang appealed, arguing that the trial court lacked territorial jurisdiction because the jewelry was received in Quezon City.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance of Manila has territorial jurisdiction over the estafa case.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that estafa is a continuing or transitory offense. Under Rule 106, Section 14(a), criminal actions may be instituted and tried in the court of the municipality or province where the offense was committed or where any of its essential ingredients took place [1].

While the receipt of the jewelry occurred in Quezon City, the misappropriation or conversion—which is an essential element of estafa—took place in the City of Manila where Yumang pledged the articles without the owner's consent [1]. Since an essential ingredient of the offense was committed in Manila, the Court of First Instance of Manila had valid jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case [1, 2].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
