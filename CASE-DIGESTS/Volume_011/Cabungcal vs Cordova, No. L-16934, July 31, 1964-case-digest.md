I. CAPTION
ISABEL G. CABUNGCAL and SOCORRO DE PAEZ v. TEOFISTO M. CORDOVA and DAISY B. GUSTILO, G.R. No. L-16934, July 31, 1964, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Isabel Cabungcal and Socorro De Paez, along with Respondent Daisy Gustilo, were occupants and applicants for the purchase of Lot No. 379-B-40, a 289-square-meter patrimonial property of Bacolod City [1, 2]. Under Section 3(c) of City Ordinance No. 13, Series of 1959, the sale of "side-lots" bordering Lacson and Burgos Streets with more than one claimant must be determined by lottery. The only exception is if a claimant occupies at least two-thirds (2/3) of the lot, in which case they are deemed the automatic awardee [3].

On November 10, 1958, Respondent Mayor Cordova awarded the entire lot to Gustilo without conducting a lottery. A Deed of Sale was executed the following day for P8,670.00 [4]. Gustilo actually occupied only 170 square meters of the lot [5]. Petitioners filed an action to annul the award and sale and claimed damages. The Court of First Instance of Bacolod City declared the award null and ordered a raffle but denied the claim for damages [6, 7]. Both parties appealed—respondents on the nullification of the award, and petitioners on the denial of damages [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the award and sale of the lot to Gustilo without a lottery was valid.
2. W/N the Mayor is liable for damages for the erroneous award.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The award was invalid. The Supreme Court held that under Ordinance No. 13, Series of 1959, an award without a raffle for side-lots is only permissible if the claimant occupies at least two-thirds of the total area. Gustilo occupied only 170 square meters of the 289-square-meter lot, which is less than the required two-thirds [5]. Therefore, the Mayor violated the mandatory provisions of the ordinance by awarding the lot to her without a lottery.

2. **NO.** The Mayor is not liable for damages. The Court ruled that an erroneous interpretation of the provisions of an ordinance does not constitute bad faith. Absent proof that the public official acted in bad faith, an aggrieved party is not entitled to an award for damages resulting from such erroneous interpretation [8].

**Judgment affirmed.**
