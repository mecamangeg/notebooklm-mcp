I. CAPTION
**LAGUNA-TAYABAS BUS Co. v. RUFINA DIASANTA**, G.R. No. L-19882, June 30, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Rufina Diasanta was a passenger on petitioner's bus when the driver operated the vehicle recklessly. Due to excessive speed and the driver's decision to pass through holes and ruts on the road shoulder, the bus jumped violently, jerking Diasanta from her seat to the floor [1]. She suffered a fractured vertebra and was immobilized in a cast for several months [1].

Diasanta sued for damages in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI ruled in her favor, awarding actual expenses, consequential damages, P3,000 for moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees [1]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision but modified the P3,000 award to cover only **exemplary damages**, reducing it to P1,000 [1]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the awards for damages and attorney's fees contravened the Civil Code and existing jurisprudence [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the award of exemplary damages and attorney's fees is proper given the circumstances of the accident.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision.

Regarding **exemplary damages**, Article 2232 of the Civil Code allows courts to award such damages in contracts and quasi-contracts if the defendant acted in a "wanton, fraudulent, **reckless**, oppressive or malevolent manner" [3]. Since the petitioner's driver was explicitly found guilty of recklessness, the award was justified [3]. The Court distinguished this case from *Bautista v. Lovina* and *Alegre v. Batangas Transportation Co.*, noting that in those cases there was either no finding of recklessness or the injured party contributed to the accident—factors not present here [4].

Regarding **attorney's fees**, Article 2208 of the Civil Code explicitly authorizes the award of attorney's fees "when exemplary damages are awarded" [3]. Consequently, the grant of attorney's fees was proper.

The petition was denied, and the decision appealed from was **AFFIRMED** [5].
