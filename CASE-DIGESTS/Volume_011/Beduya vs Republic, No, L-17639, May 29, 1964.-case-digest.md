I. CAPTION
CESAR PABLO OBESO BEDUYA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17639, May 29, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cesar Pablo Obeso Beduya filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Cebu to correct entries in the Civil Registrar regarding his marriage contract with Catalina Tejuna Cruz. Specifically, he sought to delete the names of Sabas Obeso and Juana Bertoldo (his maternal grandparents) and substitute them with Marcial Beduya and Maxima Obeso (his real parents), as well as change his name from "Pablo Obeso" to "Cesar Pablo Obeso Beduya" [1, 2]. He claimed the erroneous data was furnished by wedding sponsors while he was unaware of the contents [2]. The lower court granted the petition. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that the changes were substantial and not correctable under the summary proceeding of Article 412 of the Civil Code [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the correction of the parents' names and the petitioner's name in the civil registry is allowed under Article 412 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that Article 412 of the Civil Code allows only the correction of clerical mistakes—those visible to the eyes or obvious to the understanding—and not substantial changes that affect the civil status or nationality of the persons involved [3, 4]. The requested correction refers to the petitioner's family relationship and filiation, which necessarily affects his civil status and involves changes in the rights and obligations of the parties [5, 6]. Such changes can only be effected in a proper proceeding where all persons concerned, including the parents and grandparents, are given an opportunity to be heard; in this case, neither the grandparents nor the true parents were summoned [6, 7].

The decision appealed from is reversed and the petition dismissed [8].
