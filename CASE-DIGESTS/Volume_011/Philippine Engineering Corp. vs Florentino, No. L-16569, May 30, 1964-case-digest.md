I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE ENGINEERING CORP. v. AMADO FLORENTINO and WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-16569, May 30, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Amado Florentino was employed as a truck driver by petitioner Philippine Engineering Corp. since 1946. In 1952, he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), granted six months of paid sick leave, and allowed to resume work afterward. His illness recurred in 1956, leading to his reassignment to lighter duties until he was laid off on February 20, 1958. On June 4, 1958, Florentino filed a claim for compensation. Petitioner contested the claim, arguing it was filed beyond the two-month period prescribed by Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 3428). Petitioner also claimed the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) lacked jurisdiction due to Reorganization Plan No. 20-A and sought to deduct P657.84, allegedly given as loans, from the award. The WCC ruled in favor of Florentino, prompting this appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claim for compensation is barred by the late filing under Section 24 of Act No. 3428.
2. W/N the Workmen's Compensation Commission has jurisdiction over the claim.
3. W/N the amounts advanced by the petitioner should be deducted from the compensation award.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the late filing of a claim does not bar the right to receive compensation when the employer has voluntarily made compensation payments. The petitioner had provided Florentino with paid sick leave, medical services, and monetary aid (characterized as advance salaries or compensation) during his illness. Under the Workmen's Compensation Act, such voluntary payments render the timely filing of a claim unnecessary [1].

2. **YES.** The WCC retains jurisdiction over the claim. The Court rejected petitioner's argument based on Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, noting that said plan, which purported to abolish the WCC, had already been declared unconstitutional [2].

3. **NO.** The Court affirmed the Commission's refusal to deduct the P657.84 claimed as "loans." The WCC found that this amount had already been credited to the petitioner as payment for separation pay in a separate case (RO3-WC Case LS-1715) involving the same parties [3].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision and order appealed from are **AFFIRMED**, with costs.
