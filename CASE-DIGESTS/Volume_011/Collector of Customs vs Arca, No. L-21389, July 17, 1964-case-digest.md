I. CAPTION
COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS FOR THE PORT OF MANILA v. HON. FRANCISCO ARCA and TOMAS CLOMA, G.R. No. L-21389, July 17, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
The Collector of Customs instituted seizure proceedings against 600 hogsheads of Virginia leaf tobacco consigned to Auyong Hian, which the Supreme Court had previously declared illegal in *Climaco v. Auyong Hian*. On April 23, 1963, the Collector declared the tobacco forfeited and ordered its sale at public auction.

Subsequently, respondent Tomas Cloma filed a civil case in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against Auyong Hian for the collection of alleged fees for services rendered in obtaining the licenses for said importation. Cloma applied for and was granted a writ of attachment by respondent Judge Arca covering the subject tobacco. Despite the Collector’s Third-Party Claim arguing the goods were in *custodia legis*, Judge Arca issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the Collector from proceeding with the auction sale. The Collector filed this petition for certiorari and prohibition to set aside the CFI orders.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to issue a writ of attachment and injunction against property subject to forfeiture proceedings by the Collector of Customs.
2. W/N the writ of attachment issued in favor of Cloma was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Collector of Customs, when sitting in forfeiture proceedings under the Tariff and Customs Code, constitutes a tribunal upon which the law expressly confers jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions touching forfeiture and disposition of the subject matter [1]. This jurisdiction is exclusive to prevent importation of prohibited articles [2]. Consequently, the CFI has no jurisdiction to interfere with the Collector's actuations regarding goods in *custodia legis* of the Bureau of Customs.

2. **NO.** Cloma's claim for services rendered is a purely personal right against the debtor (Auyong Hian) and not a real right against the shipment itself [3]. Under Rule 57, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, such a personal right is not a valid basis for a writ of attachment against specific property of the debtor that has already been forfeited to the Government. The writ of attachment and the subsequent preliminary injunction were therefore null and void [3].

Petition is GRANTED. The orders of the respondent Judge are set aside, and the preliminary injunction against the Collector is dissolved [4].
