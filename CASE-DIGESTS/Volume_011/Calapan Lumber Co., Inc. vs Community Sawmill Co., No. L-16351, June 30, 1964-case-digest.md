**I. CAPTION**
CALAPAN LUMBER COMPANY, INC. v. COMMUNITY SAWMILL COMPANY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16351, June 30, 1964, Padilla, J.

**II. FACTS**
The Provincial Board of Oriental Mindoro passed Resolution No. 222 (1950) and Resolution No. 119 (1953), granting Calapan Lumber Co. (petitioner) the authority to construct and the right to *exclusively* use a portion of the "Viga-Communal-Goob" provincial road for 20 years. The resolutions allowed the petitioner to prohibit other logging concerns, specifically Community Sawmill Co. (respondents), from using the road. The petitioner constructed the road at its own expense.

Subsequently, the Provincial Board passed Resolution No. 186 (1953), revoking the previous resolutions on the ground that provincial roads are for public use and cannot be granted for exclusive private use. It declared the road a toll road to reimburse the petitioner. The petitioner filed an action for injunction and damages. The Court of First Instance of Oriental Mindoro ruled that Resolution 186 was valid in repealing the exclusivity but void in declaring it a toll road (violating Sec. 2131 of the Revised Administrative Code). However, the trial court declared the road to be the *private property* of the petitioner and enjoined the respondents from using it. The respondents appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Provincial Board has the power to grant the exclusive use of a provincial road to a private entity.
2. W/N the road became the private property of the petitioner because it was built at the petitioner's expense.
3. W/N the Civil Code provisions on builders in good faith apply to public roads.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Provincial Board's resolutions (Nos. 222 and 119) granting exclusive use were *ultra vires*. The Board is not authorized by the Revised Administrative Code (specifically Secs. 2067, 2102, 2106, and 2113) to grant exclusive use of a provincial road to a private company. Provincial roads are properties for public use, and the Board cannot enter into agreements that discriminate against the general public. Consequently, Resolution No. 186 revoking the grant of exclusivity was in accord with law [1].

2. **NO.** The road connects two finished parts of a provincial road and was laid out by the District Engineer on land ceded by owners for public use [2]. The mere fact that the petitioner surveyed and constructed the road at its own expense does not convert it into a private road [2]. It remains a public utility which the people of the province are entitled to use.

3. **NO.** The provisions of the Civil Code (Arts. 448 and 546) regarding the rights of a builder in good faith on private land cannot be invoked or applied to a public road where public interest is involved [3].

However, to prevent injustice, the Court held that the Provincial Board must reimburse the petitioner. The Board may elect to: (1) Pay the petitioner the total cost of construction with legal interest; or (2) Secure the necessary recommendation from the Secretary of Public Works and authorization from the President to designate the road as a toll road (under Sec. 2131, Revised Administrative Code) to raise funds for reimbursement [4].

**Judgment affirmed with modifications.** The road is declared public, and the injunction against respondents is lifted, subject to the province's obligation to reimburse the petitioner.
