I. CAPTION
CONSUELO DE PERALTA v. WALTER MANGUSANG, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18110, July 31, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Walter Mangusang was the holder of a certificate of public convenience for a jeepney line in Baguio City. On February 1, 1958, he sold his jeepney to Teofilo Costales without the required approval of the Public Service Commission (PSC). On March 3, 1958, the jeepney figured in an accident on Session Road, causing injuries to passenger Consuelo de Peralta [1].

De Peralta filed a suit for breach of contract of carriage against Mangusang, Mrs. Costales, and the driver. The trial court dismissed the case against Mrs. Costales and the driver for lack of privity of contract but held Mangusang, as the registered owner, liable for damages. Mangusang did not appeal the judgment but filed a cross-claim against Teofilo Costales (the actual owner), seeking reimbursement. The trial court admitted the cross-claim and rendered an Amending Decision holding Costales subsidiarily liable to indemnify Mangusang for the damages paid to De Peralta. Costales appealed, arguing that under the "kabit system" or unapproved transfer jurisprudence, only the registered owner is liable [2], [3], [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the transferee of a public utility vehicle sold without Public Service Commission approval is liable to indemnify the registered owner for damages paid to a third party.
2. W/N a cross-claim may be filed after judgment has been rendered in the main case.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While the registered owner remains directly responsible to the public and the PSC for consequences of the vehicle's operation due to the lack of approval for the transfer (Sec. 20[g], Public Service Act), he has the right to be indemnified by the actual owner/transferee. The Court, citing *Erezo v. Jepte* and *Tamayo v. Aquino*, held that the transferee acts as the agent of the registered owner in operating the vehicle. Therefore, the transferee is responsible to the registered owner for any damages caused by his negligence [4], [5]. The lack of registration with the Motor Vehicles Office does not negate the transfer of ownership between the parties [6].

2. **YES.** The Rules of Court should be liberally construed to secure substantial justice. Although the cross-claim should ideally be filed before judgment, filing it afterwards achieved the same result as filing an independent civil action. Since Costales was given his day in court to defend against the cross-claim, the procedure was valid [7].

The appealed decision is AFFIRMED [8].
