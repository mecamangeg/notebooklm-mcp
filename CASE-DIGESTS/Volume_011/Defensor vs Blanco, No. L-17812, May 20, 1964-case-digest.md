I. CAPTION
**CIPRIANO DEFENSOR v. THE HONORABLE RAMON BLANCO and DEMOCRITO DELEONIO**, G.R. No. L-17812, May 20, 1964, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Democrito Deleonio, the owner of a parcel of agricultural land in Dumangas, Iloilo, filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) to eject his tenant, petitioner Cipriano Defensor [1]. Deleonio sought dispossession on the ground that he intended to cultivate the land personally, having complied with the required notices [1]. Defensor opposed the petition, arguing that Deleonio was not the absolute owner but merely a *vendee a retro* (buyer under a sale with right to repurchase) and thus lacked the authority to eject him under the law [2]. The CAR ruled in favor of Deleonio, ordering Defensor's ejectment [3]. Defensor appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that under Republic Act No. 2263, which amended the Agricultural Tenancy Act (R.A. 1199), only an absolute "landholder-owner"—not a conditional owner like a *vendee a retro*—has the right to eject a tenant for personal cultivation [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a *vendee a retro* has the right to eject a tenant on the ground of personal cultivation under Section 50(a) of R.A. 1199, as amended.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that a *vendee a retro* is an owner within the context of Section 50(a) of R.A. 1199, as amended by R.A. 2263, and thus has the right to eject a tenant for personal cultivation [6]. The Court explained that the law does not require the "landholder-owner" to be an absolute owner; a *vendee a retro* acquires ownership subject only to a resolutory condition (the vendor's right of repurchase) [6]. When the law was amended, it specifically excluded lessees and usufructuaries from this right but did not exclude *vendees a retro* [6]. Additionally, Article 1607 of the Civil Code does not deprive a *vendee a retro* of ownership rights pending consolidation of title [7]. However, the Court noted that should the vendor *a retro* repurchase the property, the ejected tenant would be entitled to reinstatement [7].

The judgment of the Court of Agrarian Relations is **AFFIRMED** [8].
