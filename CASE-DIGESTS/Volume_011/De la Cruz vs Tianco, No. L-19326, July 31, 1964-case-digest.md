I. CAPTION
PETRA DE LA CRUZ v. LUCIO M. TIANCO, as Judge of the Municipal Court of Pasay City, RESTITUTO N. ASCANO, as City Engineer of Pasay and the SHERIFF OF PASAY CITY, G.R. No. L-19326, July 31, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Petra de la Cruz was prosecuted and convicted in the Municipal Court of Pasay City for violation of Republic Act No. 917 (Philippine Highway Act) for illegally constructing a house on Highway 54 [1]. She was sentenced to pay a fine of P10.00 and to remove her house from the highway [1]. De la Cruz did not appeal, the judgment became final, and she paid the fine [2]. Subsequently, the City Fiscal moved for the demolition of the house, which respondent Judge Tianco granted [2, 3].

De la Cruz filed a petition for certiorari with injunction before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, arguing that the Municipal Court exceeded its jurisdiction by ordering the removal of the house as part of the criminal liability, contending that a separate civil ejectment action was necessary [3, 4]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that under Article 10 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), the Code is supplementary to special laws, and the court had inherent power to order the removal of the illegal structure [5]. De la Cruz appealed directly to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipal Court has the authority to order the demolition of a house illegally constructed on a public highway in a criminal case, in addition to the penalty of a fine.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. The Court held that an ordinary civil action for ejectment should not be confounded with the removal of obstructions illegally constructed by squatters as a result of a criminal offense [6]. Houses erected without governmental authority on public streets and waterways are nuisances *per se* (*Sitchon v. Aquino*; *Quinto v. Lacson*) and may be removed by the government [6].

Furthermore, the Court upheld the CFI's application of Article 10 of the Revised Penal Code, which makes the Code supplementary to special laws like R.A. 917 unless provided otherwise [5, 7]. Consequently, general provisions such as Article 45 regarding the confiscation/forfeiture of instruments of the crime, and the inherent powers of the court to do all things reasonably necessary for the administration of justice, justify the order [5]. The petitioner was not denied due process as she was given her day in court, and her house was not confiscated but merely removed from government property where it had no right to stay [6].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED [8].
