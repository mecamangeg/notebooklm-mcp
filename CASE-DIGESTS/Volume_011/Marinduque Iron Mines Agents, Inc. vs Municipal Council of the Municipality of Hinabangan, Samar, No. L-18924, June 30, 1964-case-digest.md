I. CAPTION
MARINDUQUE IRON MINES AGENTS, INC. v. THE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF HINABANGAN, SAMAR, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18924, June 30, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On June 27, 1960, the Municipal Council of Hinabangan, Samar enacted Ordinance No. 7, Series of 1960, titled "An Ordinance Imposing a Municipal License Tax On the Gross Outputs of the Mines and Other Business" [1], [2]. Section 2 of the ordinance stated that R.A. 2264 "empowers the Municipal Council... to impose a graduated Municipal License Fees... based on the gross outputs or sales" [3]. Petitioner Marinduque Iron Mines Agents, Inc., which operated the only mine in the municipality, filed a petition for declaratory relief in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, questioning the ordinance's validity [4]. The CFI declared the ordinance null and void [4]. The respondents appealed, arguing the ordinance validly imposed a tax and did not constitute double taxation, while the petitioner contended the ordinance merely declared authority to tax without actually imposing one, and violated the prohibition against taxes based on sales under R.A. 2264 [5], [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Ordinance No. 7 actually levies a tax.
2. W/N the ordinance is valid under Republic Act No. 2264.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The ordinance fails to levy any tax. Section 2 is merely declaratory of the authority to tax, stating that the law "empowers" the Council to impose fees, rather than expressly imposing them [7]. A tax cannot be imposed by implication; statutes must be construed strictly against the subjection to tax liability, especially when accompanied by penal provisions [8], [9].

2. **NO.** The ordinance is invalid because it violates Section 2 of Republic Act No. 2264, which prohibits municipalities from imposing "any percentage tax on sales or other taxes in any form based thereon" [10], [11]. Although the ordinance imposes a graduated tax rather than a percentage tax, it is based on "gross output or sales" measured solely by the peso value of receipts or invoices without deductions for costs [11]. Thus, it effectively constitutes a tax based on sales, which is explicitly prohibited [12]. The plea that the Municipal Council members are not attorneys affords no excuse for failing to observe established legal principles [12].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [13].
