I. CAPTION
TEODOSIA NATIVIDAD and RUFINO POQUIZ v. MARCELIANO NADAL, TOMAS NADAL, FILEMON NADAL and ISABELO MENDOZA, G.R. No. L-14862, August 21, 1964, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Appellants Natividad and Poquiz filed a Motion for Reconsideration of a Supreme Court decision dated May 30, 1961, which had affirmed the lower court's judgment against them. They called the Court's attention to a stipulation of fact that since 1942, they and their predecessor-in-interest had been in continuous, exclusive, and adverse possession of Lot No. 34 (consisting of 45,827 sq.m.) as owners. This possession existed despite a notation on the back of Certificate of Title No. 1633 stating that the lot belonged to appellee Marceliano Nadal. This notation was derived from a decree entered by the Court of Land Registration prior to the effectivity of Act No. 3621 on December 5, 1929.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appellants acquired ownership of the subject land through adverse possession despite the prior judicial decree noting the appellee's ownership.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the decree entered by the Court of Land Registration before the approval of the amendatory Act No. 3621 is comparable to a judgment in an action for quieting title. Such a decree does not preclude a party from subsequently acquiring title to the land by adverse possession pursuant to Section 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Act No. 190). Unlike a modern decree of registration which renders title imprescriptible, the specific decree in this case did not prevent the running of the prescriptive period. Since the stipulation of facts established that the appellants had been in possession of the land for more than ten years (since 1942), they successfully acquired title by prescription.

The original judgment promulgated on May 30, 1961, is SET ASIDE, and the case is REMANDED to the court of origin to proceed with the trial in accordance with this resolution.
