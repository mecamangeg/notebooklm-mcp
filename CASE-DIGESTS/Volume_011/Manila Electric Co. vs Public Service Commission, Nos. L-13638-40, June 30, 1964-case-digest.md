I. CAPTION
MANILA ELECTRIC COMPANY v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-13638-40, June 30, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
In 1955, Manila Electric Company (Meralco) filed applications with the Public Service Commission (PSC) for the revision of its rates. The PSC requested an audit by the General Auditing Office (GAO), which submitted a report in May 1956. On June 22, 1956, the PSC held a "preliminary" and "informal" hearing to define issues. During this proceeding, Meralco objected to the GAO report and expressly requested a formal hearing to present evidence to refute the report and cross-examine the auditors. The PSC acknowledged the request but never set a subsequent hearing. On December 27, 1957, the PSC rendered a decision ordering Meralco to reduce its rates effective January 1958, basing its ruling solely on the GAO report and the pleadings. Meralco's motion for reconsideration was denied, leading to this petition for review.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission denied Meralco due process by rendering a decision without a formal hearing to present evidence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that Meralco was not accorded due process of law. It is a "cardinal right of a party in trials and administrative proceedings to be heard," which includes the right to present one's own case and submit evidence in support thereof [1]. The record established that the June 22, 1956 proceeding was merely an "informal hearing" intended to define issues, and the Commission had assured the parties that a formal hearing would follow for the reception of evidence [2, 3]. The Court emphasized that the PSC cannot fix rates based on a GAO report without affording the petitioner the opportunity to cross-examine the authors or refute the controversial facts alleged therein [4].

The Decision and order were **SET ASIDE**, and the records were **REMANDED** to the Commission for further proceedings [5].
