I. CAPTION
MANUEL DE LARA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18203, May 29, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Manuel De Lara, a citizen of the Chinese Nationalist Republic, sought naturalization as a Filipino citizen [1, 2]. He claimed exemption from filing a declaration of intention by alleging he was born in Labo, Camarines Norte on December 23, 1928, and had resided there continuously [2, 3]. However, he admitted spending a significant portion of his time in Manila, where he studied and obtained a degree in Architecture [2, 4]. To prove his birth in the Philippines (as local civil registry records were destroyed during World War II), De Lara relied solely on his own testimony and his Alien Certificate of Registration and Immigrant Certificate of Residence [3, 5]. He did not present his parents or baptismal certificate for corroboration [3]. His two character witnesses were residents of Labo [4]. The Court of First Instance of Camarines Norte granted the petition [6]. The Republic appealed, arguing insufficient proof of birth and lack of qualification of the character witnesses [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner sufficiently proved his birth in the Philippines to be exempt from filing a declaration of intention.
2. W/N the character witnesses were qualified to attest to petitioner's good conduct.
3. W/N the failure to state his residence in Manila in the petition is a fatal defect.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that evidence of birth in the Philippines to support an exemption from the declaration of intention cannot be established merely by the petitioner's testimony, even if civil records were destroyed [3]. Such a claim must be corroborated by his parents (unless shown to be dead) or by a baptismal certificate [3]. Furthermore, the Alien Certificate of Registration and Immigrant Certificate of Residence do not furnish proof of the place of birth [5].
2. **NO.** The Court held that since the petitioner spent a good portion of his time in Manila for his studies, character witnesses who resided only in Labo could not qualify to attest to his "proper and irreproachable manner during the entire period of his residence in the Philippines" [4].
3. **YES.** The Court declared that the failure of the petition to mention the different places of residence of the petitioner in Manila where he studied is a "serious flaw" in his claim for citizenship [7].

The decision appealed from is reversed [7].
