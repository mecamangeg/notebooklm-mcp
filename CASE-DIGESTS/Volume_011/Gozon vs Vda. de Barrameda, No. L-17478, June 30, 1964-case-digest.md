I. CAPTION
FERNANDO GOZON v. SALUD VDA. DE BARRAMEDA, G.R. No. L-17478, June 30, 1964, 11 SCRA 376, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellee Gozon and defendant-appellant Barrameda entered into a written lease contract for a period of six years with a total rental value of P48,000.00 [1]. The contract stipulated that failure to pay any installment confers on the lessor the right to terminate the contract and, should court action ensue, the lessee binds herself to pay P5,000.00 as liquidated damages [2].

Barrameda failed to pay the fourth installment due on April 20, 1958. Consequently, Gozon filed a complaint for unlawful detainer in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Caloocan in June 1958, praying for recovery of premises, unpaid rentals, and the P5,000.00 liquidated damages [3]. The JP Court rendered a decision in favor of Gozon, ordering Barrameda to pay the rentals and the liquidated damages [4].

Barrameda appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, arguing that the JP Court had no jurisdiction to award P5,000.00 liquidated damages (as the jurisdictional amount for civil cases was then limited to P2,000.00) and that the amount was unconscionable [5, 6]. The CFI affirmed the JP Court's decision. Barrameda appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Justice of the Peace Court had jurisdiction to award P5,000.00 as liquidated damages in an ejectment case.
2. W/N the award of P5,000.00 liquidated damages is unconscionable.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Justice of the Peace Court had jurisdiction. While inferior courts generally have exclusive jurisdiction over forcible entry and detainer regardless of the amount of damages for reasonable use and occupation [7], the liquidated damages here were properly included because they arose from the same breach of contract. The Court held that a single breach of a single contract gives rise to only one cause of action [2]. Under Section 3, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court, splitting a single cause of action is prohibited [2]. Therefore, the claim for liquidated damages was correctly included as an incident to the ejectment case to avoid splitting the cause of action [2]. Furthermore, the Court noted the issue was academic as Republic Act No. 3828 had raised the jurisdiction of JP courts to P10,000.00 [8].

2. **NO.** The amount is not unconscionable. The Court reasoned that the contract involved a total amount of P48,000.00 over six years [8]. Considering the potential losses Gozon might suffer if unable to find a new tenant for months, alongside the necessity of employing counsel, the P5,000.00 stipulated penalty is not iniquitous absent proof to the contrary [1, 8].

**Decision affirmed.**
