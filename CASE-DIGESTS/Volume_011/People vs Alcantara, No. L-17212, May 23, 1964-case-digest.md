**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LT. ALCANTARA alias COMMANDER PEPE, ET AL., defendants, MAXIMO ESPEDIDO, defendant-appellant, G.R. No. L-17212, May 23, 1964.

**II. FACTS**
On May 24, 1955, in Lopez, Quezon, a group of Huks led by Lt. Alcantara kidnapped Gregorio Yumul, Sr. and his son, Gregorio Yumul, Jr. The kidnappers demanded P60,000 in ransom, which was later reduced to P30,000. After the payment of the ransom in two installments (P27,000 and P3,000), the victims were released. Maximo Espedido, the 70-year-old father-in-law of co-accused Ceferino Osuna, was charged as a principal. The prosecution alleged that Espedido induced the Huks to kidnap Yumul to prevent him from running in the upcoming elections. The Court of First Instance of Quezon found Espedido guilty as a principal in the crime of kidnapping for ransom and sentenced him to death. Espedido appealed the decision.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Maximo Espedido is guilty as a principal for the crime of kidnapping for ransom.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that Espedido was not guilty as a principal but only as an **accomplice**.

The Court found "grave doubts" that Espedido himself induced the Huk leaders to kidnap the victim. The prosecution witness's testimony regarding Espedido's suggestion to kidnap Yumul for electoral reasons was uncorroborated and doubtful. Another witness's testimony regarding an agreement was deemed hearsay as the witness was not present during the alleged conference.

However, the Court was satisfied that Espedido participated in the crime in "some other manner" acting as a **go-between**. The evidence showed that: (1) he was sent by his son-in-law to confer with the Huks; (2) he bore a note from the Huk commander to his son-in-law; and (3) he was present during negotiations in the mountains, giving him knowledge of the crime. These acts did not constitute direct inducement or participation in the conspiracy (principal), but established his liability as an accomplice.

The judgment of the lower court was **SET ASIDE**. Espedido was found guilty as an **ACCOMPLICE** and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 6 years and 1 day of *prisión mayor* to 12 years and 1 day of *reclusión temporal*, taking into account his advanced age.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Bengzon (C.J.), Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Paredes, Dizon, and Makalintal concurred.
