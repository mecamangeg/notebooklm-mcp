I. CAPTION
ROMAN OZAETA (as executor of the Testate Estate of Carlos Palanca y Tanguinlay) v. SEBASTIAN C. PALANCA and LIBERTY INS. CORP., G.R. No. L-17455, August 31, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Defendant-appellant Sebastian C. Palanca executed a deed of assignment with his co-heirs, renouncing his shares in the estates of his father and sister in exchange for specific properties in Sorsogon [1]. The probate court approved the deed and ordered the plaintiff-appellee, executor Roman Ozaeta, to deliver the properties [1]. Ozaeta executed a deed of conveyance pursuant to this order [1]. Palanca subsequently filed counterclaims against Ozaeta, alleging that Ozaeta failed to deliver the properties "free from all liens and encumbrances" because they were in the actual adverse possession of third parties [2]. Palanca claimed damages for the value of the properties and lost income [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the counterclaims for failure to state a cause of action [4]. Palanca appealed, arguing his rights under the deed of assignment were violated [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the executor can be held liable for the alleged breach of the deed of assignment regarding the condition of the properties.
2. W/N adverse possession by third parties constitutes a "lien" or "encumbrance" in law.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The executor cannot be held liable because he was not a party to the deed of assignment [3]. His participation was merely to comply with the probate court's order to convey the properties [3]. The Court held that on a sale of a decedent's property under a court order, "there is no implied warranty, either of title or quality" (citing *Nutt vs. Anderson*), and an order authorizing a representative to sell ordinarily protects the representative acting in pursuance thereof [5]. Palanca's remedy, if any, lies against the co-heirs with whom he contracted [5].

2. **NO.** The Court held that "an adverse possession of property by another is not an incumbrance in law, and does not contradict the condition that the property be free from encumbrance" (citing *Yuson, et al. v. Diaz*, 42 Phil. 22) [6, 7]. Furthermore, adverse possession is not a "lien," which connotes security for a claim (citing *Shanghai Banking Corp. v. Rafferty*, 39 Phil. 145) [7].

The Order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [7].
