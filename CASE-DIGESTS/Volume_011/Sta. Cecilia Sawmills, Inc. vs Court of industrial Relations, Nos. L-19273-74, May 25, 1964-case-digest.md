I. CAPTION
STA. CECILIA SAWMILLS, INC. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and TAGKAWAYAN LABOR UNION, G.R. Nos. L-19273-74, May 25, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Sta. Cecilia Sawmills, Inc. filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the Court's decision concerning the dismissal of its employees. The petitioner argued that the order requiring the reinstatement of 113 laborers should be set aside due to the impossibility of reinstatement and the financial losses it would cause the company [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Motion for Reconsideration based on the impossibility of reinstatement should be granted.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that it had already taken into account the impossibility of reinstating the laborers, a fact previously alleged by the petitioner in its motion for new trial [1]. Precisely because of this impossibility, the Court, instead of ordering actual reinstatement, decreed that the laborers should be entitled to three months' back pay [1]. The Court ruled that the petitioner has no ground for complaint, as the financial loss suffered from granting three months' pay serves as the penalty for dismissing the employees without just cause [1].

The Motion for Reconsideration is denied [2].
