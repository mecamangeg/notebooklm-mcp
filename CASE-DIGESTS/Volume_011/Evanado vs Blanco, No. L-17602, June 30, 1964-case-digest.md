I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO EVANADO and REBECCA ARBIAS v. THE HON. RAMON BLANCO, SIMEON EVANADO and CATALINA SALES, G.R. No. L-17602, June 30, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Francisco Evanado and Rebecca Arbias owned a 7-hectare parcel of land in Iloilo. On August 15, 1955, they entered into a written leasehold tenancy agreement with Respondents Simeon Evanado (Francisco’s father) and Catalina Sales, setting an annual rental of P200.00 and 7 cavans of palay for the riceland. In 1959, Respondents filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) for liquidation of crops for the years 1955-1958, alleging that Petitioners appropriated the entire produce.

Petitioners challenged the CAR's jurisdiction, arguing the contract was a simple civil lease, not a tenancy, because Simeon was 71 years old and the land was actually cultivated by a third person, Exequiel Sencil. The CAR assumed jurisdiction, ruling that Sencil was part of the immediate farm household. The CAR further ruled that the agreed rentals were excessive and illegal based on the *net* produce of the land, ordering Petitioners to refund alleged overpayments.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations had jurisdiction over the case.
2. W/N the rentals agreed upon were excessive and illegal under R.A. 1199.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CAR's jurisdiction. The factual finding that Exequiel Sencil, who cultivated the land, was a member of the tenants' immediate farm household (employed as domestic help or *harga*) was supported by evidence. Thus, the relationship was correctly characterized as a leasehold tenancy, falling under the jurisdiction of the Agrarian Court [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the trial court erred in declaring the rentals excessive based on the *net* produce. **Section 46(a) of R.A. 1199** fixes the maximum rental for leasehold tenancy of riceland based on the **gross** produce, not the net. The evidence and the petition itself only referred to net produce (90 to 130 cavans) and failed to show the gross produce. Where there is no showing of the gross produce, the trial court is not justified in concluding rentals are excessive; consequently, the presumption of the legality of the agreed rentals stands [3].

Accordingly, the judgment is **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**. Petitioners are not liable for the alleged overpayments for 1955-1957. However, they must pay Respondents the value of the 1957-1958 crop they appropriated, minus the agreed lawful rental for that year [2, 4].
