I. CAPTION
DIOSDADO NIEMBRA, ET AL. v. THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES and EMILIO A. SUAREZ, INC., G.R. No. L-20084, July 17, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Diosdado Niembra and others filed a complaint against the Director of Lands and Emilio A. Suarez, Inc., seeking the cancellation of the latter's certificate of title over a parcel of land. They alleged fraud, collusion, and negligence by land officials in approving the sale and survey, claiming the land should revert to the public domain so they could apply for patents. The complaint was styled as a class suit, but only named three plaintiffs and referred to others as "et al." The Court of First Instance of Cotabato dismissed the complaint on two grounds: (1) plaintiffs lacked the legal personality to institute an action for reversion, which under Section 101 of the Public Land Law (Act No. 141) must be instituted by the Solicitor General; and (2) there was a lack of joinder of necessary parties, as the requirements for a class suit were not met. The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved only questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the complaint for failure to join necessary parties was proper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the dismissal but modified it to be without prejudice. The Court held that before a case proceeds to trial, it is the duty of the court to ensure that all parties having an interest in the subject matter are joined. This is necessary to prevent multiplicity of suits and to ensure the results are binding on all claimants. The Supreme Court found the trial court's ruling well-founded, as no sufficient representative parties had been joined to justify a class suit. However, recognizing that a dismissal with prejudice might cause injustice to parties affected by the alleged maladministration of public lands, the Court affirmed the decision but modified it to be **without prejudice**.
