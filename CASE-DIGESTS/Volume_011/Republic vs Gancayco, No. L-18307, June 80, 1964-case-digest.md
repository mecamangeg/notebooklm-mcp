I. CAPTION
Republic of the Philippines v. Santiago Gancayco, G.R. No. L-18307, June 30, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On June 13, 1946, the Collector of Internal Revenue assessed Santiago Gancayco P11,203.19 for 1946 taxes. After Gancayco requested a reinvestigation, the Collector issued a revised assessment on March 3, 1949. On March 31, 1949, Gancayco again requested a thorough reinvestigation, claiming he had possession of books and documents to support his objections, and placed them at the Collector's disposal. The Collector gave him until April 1, 1949, to submit evidence, which he had already offered. However, the Collector took no further action and did not conduct a reinvestigation.

More than ten years later, on May 17, 1960, the Collector demanded payment, citing *Collector v. Suyoc Consolidated* to claim that the request for reinvestigation suspended the prescriptive period. On July 19, 1960, the Republic filed a complaint for collection with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. Gancayco moved to dismiss on the ground of prescription under Section 332 of the Revenue Code, which sets a five-year limitation for court proceedings after assessment. The CFI sustained the defense of prescription and dismissed the case. The Republic appealed, arguing that the request for reinvestigation and extrajudicial demands tolled the prescriptive period.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the government's right to collect the taxes has prescribed.
2. W/N extrajudicial demands suspend the prescriptive period for the collection of taxes.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The right to collect has prescribed. Section 332(c) of the Revenue Code requires judicial proceedings for collection to begin within five years after the assessment. Here, the suit was filed in 1960, far beyond the five-year period from the 1949 revised assessment. The Court held that the mere act of requesting a reinvestigation does not suspend the prescriptive period; the request must be *granted* to effect such suspension (*Collector v. Suyoc Consolidated*; *Republic v. Ablaza*). In this case, the Collector ignored the request and failed to examine the evidence Gancayco placed at his disposal for over a decade.

2. **NO.** The Court rejected the Solicitor General's argument that extrajudicial demands tolled the period under the Civil Code. The Internal Revenue Code, being a special law, prevails over the general provisions of the Civil Code. Under Section 332(b) of the Revenue Code, the only agreement that can suspend the prescriptive period is a *written agreement* between the taxpayer and the Collector entered into before the expiration of the five-year period. Extrajudicial demands alone are insufficient.

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
