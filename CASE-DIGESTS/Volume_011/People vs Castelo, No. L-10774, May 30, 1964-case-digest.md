I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. OSCAR CASTELO, AUGUSTO MELENCIO, BIENVENIDO MENDOZA, JOSE DE JESUS, HIPOLITO BONIFACIO, DOMINGO GONZALES, FELIX MIRAY, and PEDRO ENRIQUEZ, G.R. No. L-10774, May 30, 1964, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
Appellant Oscar Castelo, then Secretary of Justice and acting Secretary of National Defense, was facing bribery and extortion charges raised by Senator Claro M. Recto. Manuel P. Monroy was a key witness against Castelo in these charges. To silence Monroy, Castelo conspired with his bodyguard Bienvenido "Ben Ulo" Mendoza and other confidential agents (the "boys"). The plan was to kill Monroy while Castelo was out of the country to establish an alibi. On June 15, 1953, while Castelo was in Korea, Ben Ulo's group executed the plan in Pasay City, with appellant Jose de Jesus shooting Monroy to death.

The Court of First Instance of Rizal convicted the eight appellants of murder and sentenced them to death. During the appeal, state witness Rogelio Robles recanted his testimony, prompting a new trial for Castelo, but the lower court maintained the conviction. The appellants claimed alibi and alleged that their extrajudicial confessions were obtained through violence or "wheedling."

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the guilt of the accused for murder was proven beyond reasonable doubt despite the recantation of the state witness and the defense of alibi.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the conviction but reduced the penalty to life imprisonment due to the lack of sufficient votes for the death penalty.

The Court held that the retraction of a witness (Robles) after a judgment of conviction is to be taken warily and rejected when rebutted by other witnesses and evidence. Robles' original testimony linking Castelo to the conspiracy was adequately supported by the "interlocking confessions" of the co-accused (Melencio, De Jesus, Enriquez, etc.). These confessions, while extrajudicial, were admissible as corroborative evidence because they were identical in essential details and made without collusion.

The Court ruled that "wheedling" or coaxing a suspect to confess does not invalidate the confession, especially when certified by court stenographers. The defense of alibi was rejected because the physical absence of the mastermind (Castelo) was part of the conspiracy, and the actual perpetrators were positively identified or confessed to their participation. It would be unjust to set the leader free while imprisoning the subordinates who merely carried out his commands.

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** with the modification that the sentence is reduced to life imprisonment, and the appellants are ordered to indemnify the heirs jointly and severally in the sum of P6,000.00.
