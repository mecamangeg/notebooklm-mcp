**I. CAPTION**
SOCIAL SECURITY EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION (PAFLU) and ALFREDO FAJARDO v. THE HON. EDILBERTO SORIANO, HON. JOSE LEUTERIO and SOCIAL SECURITY COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-20100, July 16, 1964, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
On May 16, 1961, the petitioner Social Security Employees Association (PAFLU), a labor union of Social Security Commission employees, declared a strike against the Social Security System (SSS). Respondent Judge Edilberto Soriano of the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila issued a preliminary injunction on June 12, 1961, enjoining the strike and ordering the employees to return to work [1, 2]. The strikers complied but declared a second strike on May 16, 1962 due to new disputes [3]. The SSS Commission filed a motion for contempt. Respondent Judge Jose Leuterio, substituting for Judge Soriano, issued an order on May 19, 1962, clarifying that the June 12 injunction prohibited strikes for the duration of the order [3, 4]. Petitioners moved to dissolve the injunction, arguing that under Section 9 of Republic Act No. 875 (Magna Carta of Labor), the court could not enjoin the strike. The motion was denied, prompting this petition for certiorari [4, 5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to issue an injunction against a strike in the Social Security System.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court of First Instance has no jurisdiction to issue an injunction against a strike in the Social Security System [5, 6]. The Court held that the SSS is a government-owned corporation performing proprietary functions [5, 6]. As such, it falls under the operation of the Magna Carta of Labor (Republic Act No. 875) [5, 6]. Citing *Social Security System Employees Ass'n. vs. Soriano* (G.R. No. L-18081), the Court reiterated that because the SSS is covered by the Magna Carta of Labor, the trial court lacked the jurisdiction to issue the injunctive orders against the strike [5].

The petition is granted, and the questioned orders are declared void [7].
