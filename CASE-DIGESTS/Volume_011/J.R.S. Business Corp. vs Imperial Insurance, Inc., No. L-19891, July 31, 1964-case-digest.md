I. CAPTION
J.R.S. BUSINESS CORPORATION, J.R. DA SILVA and A.J. BELTRAN v. IMPERIAL INSURANCE, INC., MACARIO M. OFILADA, and HON. AGUSTIN MONTESA, G.R. No. L-19891, July 31, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner J.R.S. Business Corporation (J.R.S.), which held a legislative franchise to conduct a messenger service, was sued by respondent Imperial Insurance, Inc. for a sum of money. The parties entered into a Compromise Agreement wherein J.R.S. admitted a debt of P61,172.32, promising to pay by May 14, 1962. The Court of First Instance approved the agreement and rendered judgment in accordance with it [1-3]. When J.R.S. failed to pay, the trial court issued a Writ of Execution. The Sheriff issued a Notice of Sale that included J.R.S.'s "whole capital stocks," "business name," "right of operation" (franchise), and other assets [3]. J.R.S. moved to release the franchise and trade name from the levy, arguing they were not subject to execution. The trial court denied the motion, and Imperial Insurance bought all the properties at the auction [3, 4]. J.R.S. appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the secondary franchise, trade name, and capital stocks of the corporation were validly sold under execution.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the inclusion of the franchise, trade name, and capital stocks in the execution sale was unjustified.

The Court distinguished between a primary franchise (the right to exist as a corporation) and a secondary franchise (rights conferred such as the right to operate a messenger service). While a secondary franchise may be levied upon, Section 56 of the Corporation Law mandates that such a sale must be "especially decreed and ordered in the judgment" [5, 6]. In this case, the judgment based on the compromise agreement did not contain any special decree making the franchise answerable for the judgment debt [6].

Consequently, the trade name, which is necessary for the enjoyment of the franchise, also could not be sold. Furthermore, the Court ruled that capital stocks represent the interest and property of the individual stockholders, not the corporation, and thus cannot be levied to satisfy the corporation's debt [6].

The sale of the properties of the petitioner is **SET ASIDE** insofar as it authorizes the levy and sale of its franchise, trade name, and capital stocks [7].
