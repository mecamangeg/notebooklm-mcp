I. CAPTION
LUCIANO GALACE, CARMEN TERREN, CECILIA SINGSON, ET AL. v. FELICIDAD M. BAGTAS, EMMA M. BAGTAS, ET AL., and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-16400, August 31, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
In a previous case (Civil Case No. 282) involving the recovery of "Hacienda Intal," Jose V. Bagtas and the petitioners (Galace, Singson, et al.) entered into a stipulation. Bagtas agreed to execute a quitclaim in favor of petitioners for any portion of their landholdings found to overlap with the Hacienda, subject to the condition that petitioners would extend "full cooperation" so Bagtas could enjoy peaceful possession of his property. The Court approved this, setting the execution of the quitclaim for one year after the decision.

Petitioners subsequently filed the present action (Civil Case No. 717) for specific performance to compel the heirs of Bagtas to execute the quitclaim. The respondents argued that petitioners violated the condition of the agreement. The trial court and Court of Appeals found that instead of cooperating, petitioners created social unrest by petitioning for the government expropriation of the land, preventing other tenants from working, and committing theft, which forced the owners to hire security guards. During the appeal, petitioners also moved to substitute the Land Tenure Administration (LTA) as the party-defendant, claiming the government had purchased the land.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioners are entitled to the execution of the quitclaim.
2. W/N the Land Tenure Administration should be substituted as the respondent.
3. W/N the petitioners’ action for recovery/specific performance can prosper given the identification of the property.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court affirmed the findings of the lower courts that petitioners failed to comply with the suspensive condition of the obligation. The factual findings of the Court of Appeals—that petitioners caused discontent, social unrest, and committed depredations (theft) instead of cooperating—are conclusive and binding on the Supreme Court. Having violated the condition to ensure peaceful possession, they cannot invoke the obligation of the late Jose V. Bagtas [1], [2], [3].

2. **NO.** Under Section 20, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, substitution of a transferee is not essential; the action may continue against the original party. Whether to substitute or join the transferee is a matter of discretion for the court. The Supreme Court found no arbitrariness in the denial of substitution. Furthermore, there was no notice of *lis pendens* registered; thus, the LTA is not bound by the personal obligation of Bagtas to cede the land. The action is for specific performance of a private agreement, not to compel the government to resell land [4], [5], [6].

3. **NO.** It is indispensable in an action for recovery of possession that the plaintiff fully proves not only ownership but also the **identity of the property claimed**, by describing its location, area, and boundaries. The previous stipulation and survey only mentioned an "overlap" of hectares but failed to describe the specific boundaries of the portions claimed. Petitioners failed to provide the adequate identification required by law (citing *De la Cruz v. Niño* and *Marcelo v. Maniquis*) [6], [7], [8].

**Petition denied. Decision affirmed.**
