I. CAPTION
RED LINE TRANSPORTATION CO., INC. and MANUEL LEGASPI ABRAZADO v. TERESA BARRIZO, G.R. No. L-19304, August 31, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Teresa Barrizo, an authorized operator of TPU auto-trucks on the Tuguegarao-San Jose via Baggao line, applied with the Public Service Commission (PSC) to increase her equipment by eight units [1]. She presented evidence showing that the current transportation facilities—consisting of her units, one unit from petitioner Red Line Transportation Co., and one from Cal Transit—were insufficient to accommodate the volume of passengers, often leaving commuters stranded [2]. She also submitted proof of her financial capability to maintain the proposed additional service [3].

Petitioners Red Line Transportation Co. and Manuel Legaspi Abrazado opposed the application, claiming they already provided sufficient service on routes passing through Baybayog (where the road to San Jose branches off) and that their buses were not even half full [4]. The PSC granted Barrizo authority to operate six additional units, finding that the evidence established a public need for the increase and that Barrizo was financially capable [1, 5]. Petitioners appealed, seeking a review of the PSC's decision [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission's factual findings regarding the necessity of the additional service should be upheld.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision. The Court applied the established doctrine that the conclusions of fact of the Public Service Commission are not reviewable by the Supreme Court when they are supported by substantial evidence [7].

The Court found that the PSC's decision was based on a "mass of evidence" establishing that the existing buses were insufficient to cope with the passenger traffic and that the applicant was financially capable of operating the new units [5]. As the Commission's findings were fully supported by the record, the Court declined to disturb them [7].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [8].
