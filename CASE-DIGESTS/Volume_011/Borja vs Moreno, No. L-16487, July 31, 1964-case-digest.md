I. CAPTION
MANUEL BORJA v. HON. FLORENCIO MORENO and BENJAMIN YONZON, G.R. No. L-16487, July 31, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Manuel Borja owned a 104-hectare fishpond in Macabebe, Pampanga, acquired in 1937. On August 15, 1958, an administrative complaint was filed against him with the Secretary of Public Works and Communications (Moreno) for the abatement of a nuisance under R.A. No. 2056, alleging he closed a public stream called "Matlaue." Respondent Yonzon was designated to investigate.

Borja was only notified of the complaint on October 22, 1958. During the investigation, Yonzon committed several procedural acts: he proceeded with the hearing without acting on Borja's motion to dismiss; ruled that counsel’s reservation of the right to cross-examine was a waiver; conducted an ocular inspection *motu proprio* with only oral notice; called a witness (Engr. Manangan) for the government and denied Borja's counsel the right to object; and arbitrarily refused to hear Borja’s witness (Panopio) while terminating the hearing prematurely.

Secretary Moreno issued a decision ordering the demolition of Borja's dams. Borja filed a petition for certiorari, mandamus, and prohibition with the CFI of Pampanga. The CFI declared the administrative proceedings null and void. Respondents appealed, arguing findings were supported by substantial evidence and Borja failed to exhaust administrative remedies.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the administrative investigation violated Borja’s right to due process.
2. W/N Borja was required to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial intervention.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The investigation was conducted with manifest disregard of the requirements of due process. The Court found that Yonzon abused his discretion by "riding roughshod" over Borja's rights, specifically by: (1) ignoring the motion to dismiss; (2) depriving counsel of the right to cross-examine; (3) conducting an ocular inspection and questioning witnesses without sufficient notice; (4) introducing his own witness while barring objections; and (5) arbitrarily excluding Borja's evidence and rushing the termination of the hearing. Evidence received in an investigation conducted with such disregard for due process cannot justify the administrative decision.

2. **NO.** While the general rule requires the exhaustion of administrative remedies (e.g., appeal to the President) before resorting to the courts, this rule does not apply where due process of law has been manifestly denied to a party litigant. The manner in which the investigation was conducted constituted a virtual denial of due process, warranting immediate judicial review.

Judgment affirmed with exception.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
J.B.L. Reyes concurred specifically on the ground of virtual denial of due process.
