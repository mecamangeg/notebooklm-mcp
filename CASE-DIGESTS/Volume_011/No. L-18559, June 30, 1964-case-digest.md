I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE AIR LINES EMPLOYEES' ASSOCIATION (PALEA) v. PHILIPPINE AIR LINES, INC. (PAL), G.R. No. L-18559, June 30, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On January 4, 1956, PALEA and PAL entered into a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) stipulating a 48-hour workweek [1, 2]. On June 22, 1957, Republic Act No. 1880 was enacted, reducing the legal working hours to 40 hours a week (5 days x 8 hours) for government employees, expressly including those in "government-owned and controlled corporations" (GOCCs) [2]. PALEA demanded the application of RA 1880 to its members, arguing PAL is a GOCC because 54% of its stock is owned by the National Development Company (NDC), a government entity [2]. PAL refused, contending it is not a GOCC and that the CBA controls [2, 3]. PALEA filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [2]. PAL challenged the CFI's jurisdiction, arguing the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) had exclusive jurisdiction, and questioned the constitutionality of RA 1880 [3-5]. The CFI ruled in favor of PALEA, declaring PAL a GOCC subject to RA 1880 and ordering the reduction of work hours [6]. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the case.
2. W/N RA 1880 is unconstitutional for embracing more than one subject in its title.
3. W/N PAL is a government-controlled corporation subject to RA 1880.
4. W/N RA 1880 prevails over the existing Collective Bargaining Agreement.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The main issue is the legal interpretation of whether PAL falls under RA 1880, which is within the competence of the CFI [8]. The Court held that unlike cases where a dispute is likely to cause a strike (falling under CIR jurisdiction), this case was essentially for a declaratory judgment on a question of law [9]. The money claim for overtime pay is merely incidental to the main legal question, and the court having jurisdiction over the main action may grant incidental reliefs [10, 11].

2. **YES.** The constitutional injunction that a bill shall embrace only one subject expressed in its title does not require the title to be an index of the bill's contents [12]. The title of RA 1880 mentions Section 562 of the Revised Administrative Code, which governs "every branch of the government service" [12]. Thus, provisions regarding GOCCs are germane to the subject expressed in the title [12].

3. **YES.** PAL is a government-controlled corporation [13]. The Court found that over 54% of PAL's shares belong to the NDC, which is wholly owned by the government [13]. This ownership allows the government to elect the majority of the Board of Directors and control the corporation's policies [13]. The Court cited *Cervantes v. Auditor General*, noting that if a corporation with 51% government subscription is a GOCC, PAL must also be one [14].

4. **YES.** RA 1880 was passed in the exercise of the police power of the State to protect the health of workers [14, 15]. Therefore, the law prevails over the stipulations in the collective bargaining agreement regarding working hours [15].

The decision of the lower court is AFFIRMED [16].
