I. CAPTION
PETER PAUL PHILIPPINE CORPORATION v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19612, July 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Lorenzo Castro was employed as a coconut sheller by petitioner Peter Paul Philippine Corporation in 1947. He was paid on a "pakiao" (piece-work) basis [1, 2]. On February 21, 1954, he was found to have a tuberculous infection and stopped working [3]. He was separated from service in March 1954 and given separation pay [4]. On March 11, 1955, nearly a year after his separation, Castro filed a claim for compensation [4].

The Hearing Officer dismissed the claim, ruling that the sickness was not caused or aggravated by the employment [4]. However, the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed this decision, finding the ailment compensable [4]. The petitioner moved for reconsideration, arguing inter alia that the claim was filed beyond the two-month period prescribed by Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act [4]. The WCC denied the motion, prompting this petition for review [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claimant's tuberculosis is compensable.
2. W/N the claim is barred for being filed beyond the two-month reglementary period.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed that the claimant's ailment is compensable. The nature of work as a coconut sheller on a "pakiao" basis is deemed taxing on health and vitality, contributing to the deterioration of the worker's resistance to the point of contracting tuberculosis [5, 6]. The "pakiao" system compels the worker to exert rapid and continuous effort to earn more, which, combined with night duty assignments, constitutes strenuous work capable of debilitating health [7, 8].

2. **NO.** While the claim was indeed filed late, it is not barred. The two-month period for filing a claim commences from the date the disease becomes compensable or the employee becomes physically disabled [9, 10]. Although Castro filed his claim nearly a year after his disability began in March 1954, the petitioner had paid him P91.21 by way of compensation, in addition to separation pay [10]. This payment places the case within the statutory exception, rendering the strict application of the filing period unnecessary [9, 10].

Petition denied. Decision affirmed [11].
