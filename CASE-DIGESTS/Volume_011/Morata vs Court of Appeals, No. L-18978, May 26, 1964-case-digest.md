I. CAPTION
**MANUEL MORATA v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and MANRIQUE RAYMUNDO, G.R. No. L-18978, May 26, 1964, Concepcion, J.**

II. FACTS
Petitioner Manuel Morata, a civil service eligible, was the Chief of Police of Bulan, Sorsogon. On November 25, 1957, then Mayor Eulogio Santos filed an administrative case against him, leading to his suspension. While Morata was suspended and his case was pending appeal, Mayor Santos appointed respondent Manrique Raymundo as Chief of Police on November 25, 1958.

On January 22, 1959, the Commissioner of Civil Service rendered a decision finding Morata guilty and considering him resigned effective the date of his suspension (November 25, 1957). However, Morata only received this decision on April 4, 1960. Meanwhile, on January 1, 1960, the new Mayor, Rosendo Haylo, terminated Raymundo’s services and reinstated Morata. Raymundo filed a petition for *Quo Warranto*. The Court of Appeals ruled that Morata's reinstatement was void due to the Commissioner's decision but declared Raymundo lawfully entitled to the position.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Morata was validly reinstated by the Municipal Mayor on January 1, 1960.
2. W/N Raymundo’s appointment on November 25, 1958 was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed that Morata could not be reinstated. The decision of the Commissioner of Civil Service considered Morata compulsorily resigned effective November 25, 1957. Consequently, the municipal mayor could not reinstate him on January 1, 1960, without contravening said decision [1-3]. Although Morata received the decision later, its effectivity was retroactive to the date of his suspension [3].

2. **NO.** The Court reversed the Court of Appeals regarding Raymundo's entitlement to the office. When Raymundo was appointed on November 25, 1958, the position was not yet vacant because Morata was still the incumbent, albeit suspended [4]. An appointment to an office that is not vacant is null and void *ab initio* [5, 6]. The subsequent decision of the Commissioner declaring Morata resigned retroactively did not cure the defect of Raymundo's appointment. Being void *ab initio* and non-existent from a legal viewpoint, the appointment could not be revived by a subsequent act [4-6].

**The decision of the Court of Appeals is MODIFIED. Neither Manuel Morata nor Manrique Raymundo is entitled to the office of Chief of Police.**
