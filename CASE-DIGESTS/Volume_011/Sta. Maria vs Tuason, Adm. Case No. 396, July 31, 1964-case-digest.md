I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR THE DISBARMENT OF ATTORNEY EDUARDO M. TUASON. EMILIO C. STA. MARIA, petitioner**, Adm. Case No. 396, July 31, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
In June 1955, Respondent Atty. Eduardo M. Tuason represented Petitioner Emilio C. Sta. Maria and his partners, Andres Guanzon and Fausto E. Chincuanco, in a collection case (Civil Case No. 894) involving a P50,000.00 promissory note [1]. The defendant was declared in default, and the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the partnership after a brief hearing [1, 2].

On September 10, 1958, Respondent obtained P22,930.64 from the Provincial Sheriff of Pampanga to satisfy the judgment [3]. He applied the funds as follows: P10,000.00 for his attorney's fees, P1,648.00 for alleged litigation expenses, and the balance of P11,282.64 was remitted to Fausto E. Chincuanco, his uncle [3]. Petitioner filed a disbarment case, alleging malpractice and gross misconduct for the deprivation of his share and the retention of funds [4]. The Solicitor General investigated and found that while there was no connivance to deprive Petitioner of his partnership share, the collection of P10,000.00 fees for a simple default case was unreasonable and the P1,648.00 expenses were unsubstantiated [2]. The Solicitor General recommended a reprimand [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent is guilty of professional misconduct for retaining client funds and collecting excessive fees.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court found that the Respondent placed his private and personal interest over and above that of his clients, constituting a breach of the lawyer's oath [6].

The Court held that collecting P10,000.00 as fees for a simple collection suit based on a promissory note, which was terminated after one brief hearing due to the defendant's default, was unreasonable [2]. Furthermore, Respondent failed to present satisfactory evidence to justify the P1,648.00 claimed as litigation expenses [2]. The Court observed that Respondent took advantage of his close relationship with his uncle, partner Chincuanco, to retain these amounts to the prejudice of the Petitioner [7, 8]. Such acts constitute a retention of client funds and "professional indiscretion bordering on misbehaviour" [8]. Although the parties later entered into a compromise agreement where Petitioner waived claims, this only effectively condoned the act but did not erase the misconduct [8].

**Respondent is ADMONISHED that a repetition of similar acts will merit more drastic action** [6].
