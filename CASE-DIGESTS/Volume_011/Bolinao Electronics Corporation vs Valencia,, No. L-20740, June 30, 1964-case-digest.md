I. CAPTION
BOLINAO ELECTRONICS CORPORATION, CHRONICLE BROADCASTING NETWORK, INC., and MONSERRAT BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. BRIGIDO VALENCIA, Secretary of the Department of Public Works and Communications, and ROBERT SAN ANDRES of the Radio Control Division, G.R. No. L-20740, June 30, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, owners of radio and television stations, applied for the renewal of their station licenses. Respondents Brigido Valencia (Secretary of Public Works) and Robert San Andres (Radio Control Division) issued notices of hearing to investigate the applications, citing the "late filing" of said applications as a violation of Department Order No. 11 [1, 2]. Petitioners argued that the violation had ceased to exist because a Circular dated July 24, 1962, issued by the respondents, condoned previous non-observance of regulations regarding late filing, provided remedial measures were taken by August 10, 1962 [3, 4]. Petitioners had filed their applications before said deadline [5].

Intervenor Philippine Broadcasting Service (PBS) claimed that petitioner Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) had abandoned "Channel 9" in favor of PBS based on a construction permit stating "Channel 10 assigned in lieu of Channel 9" for a proposed transfer to Baguio [6]. Additionally, PBS sought to operate a TV station in Manila using funds from the 1962-1963 Budget. However, the Appropriation Act contained a condition that "no portion of this appropriation shall be used for the operation of television stations in Luzon... where there are television stations" [7]. The President vetoed this specific condition but not the appropriation item itself [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the investigation into the license renewals has a legal basis despite the circular condoning late filing.
2. W/N CBN abandoned its right to operate Channel 9.
3. W/N the President may legally veto a condition attached to an item in an appropriation bill without vetoing the item itself.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The investigation has no legal basis. The Circular dated July 24, 1962, effectively condoned the late filing of applications if corrected by August 10, 1962. Since petitioners filed their applications before this date, the violation "in legal effect, ceased to exist." [5]. Respondents cannot claim the circular they themselves issued is illegal to evade its effect [9].

2. **NO.** There was no abandonment. The statement "Channel 10 assigned in lieu of Channel 9" in the permit was conditional upon the actual transfer of the station to Baguio to avoid interference with a Clark Air Base station. Since the transfer was abandoned, the condition did not attach. Furthermore, CBN continued operating Channel 9 even after the permit issuance, proving no renunciation occurred [6, 10].

3. **NO.** The President cannot veto a condition without vetoing the appropriation item to which it relates. Under Article VI, Section 20 of the Constitution, the veto power does not carry the power to strike out conditions or restrictions while keeping the funds [11]. Such a veto is unconstitutional and produces no effect; thus, the restriction remains valid [12]. Consequently, PBS cannot use the appropriated funds to operate a television station in Manila, where commercial stations already exist [12].

The writ of prohibition is GRANTED, and the preliminary injunction is made permanent [13].
