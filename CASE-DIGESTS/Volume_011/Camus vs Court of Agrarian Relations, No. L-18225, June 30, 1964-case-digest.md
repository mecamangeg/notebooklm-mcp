I. CAPTION
MANUEL CAMUS and RAFAEL CAMUS v. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, TIBURCIO HILARIO, ET AL., VICENTE PASCUAL, RUFINO DE LA CRUZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18225, June 30, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Manuel and Rafael Camus owned a fishpond in Sagay, Occidental Negros. In 1949, they engaged private respondents as tenants to excavate and convert the fishpond into saltbeds. Under the agreement, petitioners defrayed the expenses while the salt produce was shared equally. Respondents successfully created 485 parcels of saltbeds but were subsequently ejected by petitioners between 1955 and 1957. Respondents filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) for liquidation, accounting, reinstatement, and damages. Petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that the CAR lacked jurisdiction because the land involved was not agricultural and the production of salt is not "cultivation." The CAR denied the motion, prompting petitioners to elevate the matter to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction over tenancy disputes involving land converted from fishponds to saltbeds.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The conversion of fishponds into saltbeds does not change the land's classification from agricultural to mineral. While salt is scientifically a mineral, the land used as an evaporating basin is merely a receptacle and does not become mineral land under Section 8 of the Mining Act, as the land itself does not contain the mineral deposits being extracted [1, 2].

The Court held that jurisdiction under Section 7 of R.A. No. 1267 covers not only "cultivation" but also the "use" of agricultural land [2]. Furthermore, legislative intent is clear: Section 46 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act (R.A. No. 1199) and Section 35 of the Agricultural Reform Code (R.A. No. 3844) explicitly mention saltbeds alongside fishponds as subject to tenancy laws [3]. Thus, disputes concerning saltbeds fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the CAR [4].

The orders of the respondent Court are affirmed, the writ of preliminary injunction is dissolved, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
