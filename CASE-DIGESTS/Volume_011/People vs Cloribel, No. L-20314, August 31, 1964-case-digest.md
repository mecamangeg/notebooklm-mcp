I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL, et al., G.R. No. L-20314, August 31, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On September 27, 1958, an information for falsification of documents was filed against private respondents Aguilar, et al. [1]. After arraignment in March 1959, the trial was postponed numerous times, spanning several years due to various motions by both parties and the court [2, 3]. Finally, trial was set for August 15, 1962 [4]. On said date, the government prosecutors failed to appear despite the Department of Justice (DOJ) Records Division having received the notice of hearing on July 17, 1962 [5]. Consequently, respondent Judge Cloribel issued an order "provisionally" dismissing the case upon motion of the defense [5]. The prosecution filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the assigned prosecutors did not personally receive the notice due to reassignments and heavy workload, but the Judge denied it [6, 7]. The prosecution filed a petition for certiorari, claiming grave abuse of discretion [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent Judge gravely abused his discretion in dismissing the case for failure to prosecute.
2. W/N the "provisional" dismissal constitutes double jeopardy barring the reinstatement of the case.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The dismissal of an action for failure to prosecute rests upon the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent abuse [8]. The Supreme Court found that a lapse of three years and eleven months from filing to trial violates the constitutional right to a speedy trial [9]. The Court rejected the prosecution's excuse regarding non-receipt of notice, holding that service to the DOJ Records Division is valid service to the petitioner, and internal negligence or lack of coordination cannot prejudice the respondents [10, 11].

2. **YES.** The reinstatement of the case would violate the defendants' right against double jeopardy [12]. While a dismissal upon the defendant's motion usually constitutes a waiver of double jeopardy, this rule does not apply when the dismissal is predicated on the right to a speedy trial [13]. A dismissal for failure to prosecute equates to an acquittal because the prosecution failed to prove the case when the time came [14]. The trial court's qualification of the dismissal as "provisional" is mere surplusage and cannot alter the legal effect of the order as an acquittal [15].

**Petition dismissed.** [12]

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Makalintal, J., voted for dismissal on the first ground (no grave abuse of discretion) [12].
