I. CAPTION
CONSOLIDATED LABOR ASSOCIATION OF THE PHILS. v. MARSMAN & CO., INC., G.R. Nos. L-17038 & L-17057, July 31, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
The Marsman & Company Employees and Laborers Association (MARCELA), later affiliated with petitioner Consolidated Labor Association of the Philippines (CLAP), declared a strike against respondent Marsman & Co., Inc. (Company) on June 4, 1954, after bargaining negotiations failed [1, 2]. On July 30, 1954, during a conference with the Secretary of Labor, the Company’s Vice-President offered to reinstate all strikers if they returned to work, promising to discuss demands later. The Union accepted and ended the strike [3, 4].

While the Company readmitted most strikers, it refused to reinstate 69 union officers and members, citing a "policy of retrenchment" and claiming it had enough personnel [3, 5]. Consequently, the strike resumed. The Union filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP). The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found the Company guilty of ULP and ordered the reinstatement of 60 complainants but denied backwages [6]. Both parties appealed: the Union sought backwages, while the Company questioned the ULP finding and argued the strike was illegal due to violence committed by some strikers [1, 7].

III. ISSUES
1. W/N the Company committed Unfair Labor Practice by refusing to reinstate the complainants.
2. W/N the strike was illegal such that all strikers lost their right to reinstatement.
3. W/N the reinstated employees are entitled to backwages.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Company’s refusal to readmit the complainants was an act of Unfair Labor Practice. The Court found the alleged "business exigency" or retrenchment policy false, as the Company hired new employees and increased salaries during the same period [5]. The refusal was motivated by a desire to discourage union activities. Consequently, the strike, initially economic in nature, was converted into a ULP strike from the moment the Company discriminatorily refused reinstatement after having offered to admit all strikers [5, 8].

2. **NO.** While individual strikers committed illegal acts (coercion, physical injuries) during the strike, these acts were not authorized or impliedly sanctioned by the Union [7]. Under the doctrine in *PECO v. C.I.R.*, strikers who were innocent of and did not participate in illegal acts should not be punished by deprivation of their right to reinstatement; only those individually found guilty lose such right [7, 9].

3. **NO.** In an economic strike, strikers are not entitled to backpay under the principle that "the employer should get the equivalent day's work for what he pays his employees" [9]. Although the strike converted into a ULP strike, the CIR retains discretion to grant or deny backpay. The Court held there was no abuse of discretion in denying backwages given the "climate of violence" and the "minatory attitude" of the strikers which required police patrols [10].

**Decision affirmed.**
