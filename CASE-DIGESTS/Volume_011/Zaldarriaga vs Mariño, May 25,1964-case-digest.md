I. CAPTION
REMELA ZALDARRIAGA, minor, represented by guardian ad litem, GORGONIA DE LA PEÑA v. ENRIQUE F. MARIÑO, G.R. No. L-19566, May 25, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Gorgonia de la Peña, on behalf of her minor daughter Remela Zaldarriaga, filed an ordinary civil action (Civil Case No. 4895) for the acknowledgment of Remela as the natural child of the deceased Julio Zaldarriaga and for the partition of his property [1, 2]. While the appeal of the initial dismissal of this civil case was pending (docketed as G.R. No. L-14636), Gorgonia instituted a Special Proceeding (No. 5267) for the settlement of Julio's estate [3]. The Supreme Court eventually reversed the dismissal of the civil case and remanded it, allowing Gorgonia to choose whether to proceed with the civil action or the intestate proceeding [3].

Gorgonia manifested her preference to continue with the civil action and prayed for the dismissal of Special Proceeding No. 5267 [4]. The lower court granted the dismissal [4]. Enrique F. Mariño, the judicial administrator appointed in the special proceeding, appealed the order, arguing that the probate court acquired exclusive jurisdiction over the estate settlement and that a declaration of heirs cannot be made in an ordinary civil action [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the declaration of heirs and the settlement of the estate of a deceased person may be determined in an ordinary civil action rather than a special proceeding.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the order of dismissal [6]. The Supreme Court ruled that the matter of acknowledgment of an alleged natural child and their claim to a share in the estate of the alleged natural father may be determined either in an ordinary civil action or in special proceedings for the settlement of the estate [7].

The Court relied on established jurisprudence, including *Escoval v. Escoval*, *Tiamson v. Tiamson*, and *Briz v. Briz*, to support the principle that such remedies are alternative [7, 8]. Since all persons claiming an interest in the estate were already parties in the civil action (Case No. 4895) and none objected to the dismissal of the special proceeding except the appellant administrator, the lower court properly allowed the civil case to proceed [7]. The rights of the government regarding taxes and other interested parties can be protected by intervening in the civil case [9].

The Order appealed from is affirmed [9].
