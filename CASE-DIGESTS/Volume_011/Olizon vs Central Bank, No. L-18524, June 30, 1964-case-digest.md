I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO S. OLIZON v. CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18524, June 30, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
From 1952 to 1955, the Central Bank (CB) collected P9,713.94 from Francisco Olizon as a special excise tax on foreign exchange pursuant to Monetary Board Resolution No. 286 [1]. On March 10, 1958, Olizon requested a refund [2]. The CB admitted that the resolution imposing the tax was illegal [2]. However, the CB refused to refund the amount, contending that the action had prescribed because five years had elapsed since payment, relying on Article 1149 of the Civil Code for actions with no fixed period [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Olizon, holding that the prescriptive period was ten years for an obligation created by law (Article 1144), and ordered the refund [4]. The CB appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action for the refund of the illegally collected tax has prescribed.
2. W/N the suit against the Central Bank is a suit against the State without its consent.

IV. RULING
1. **NO**. The Court held that the collection of the tax was an error based on a mistake in the interpretation of the law, which constitutes a *solutio indebiti* (quasi-contract) under Articles 2154 and 2155 of the Civil Code [5, 6]. Therefore, the applicable prescriptive period is **six (6) years** for actions upon a quasi-contract under **Article 1145(2)** of the Civil Code [6, 7]. The Court rejected both the CB's claim of five years and the lower court's ruling of ten years, but affirmed the refund as the CB admitted the claim was filed within the six-year period [8].

2. **NO**. The Central Bank is a corporate entity expressly authorized by its charter to sue and be sued; thus, consent to be sued has been given [9, 10]. Furthermore, Section 5 of Republic Act No. 601 specifically mandates the Central Bank to refund taxes collected under said Act, making it the proper party defendant [10].

**Petition denied. Judgment affirmed.**
