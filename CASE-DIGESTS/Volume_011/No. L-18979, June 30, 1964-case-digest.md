I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE TESTATE ESTATE OF THE LATE JOSEFA VILLACORTE. CELSO ICASIANO v. NATIVIDAD ICASIANO and ENRIQUE ICASIANO, G.R. No. L-18979, June 30, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On June 2, 1956, Josefa Villacorte executed a last will and testament in duplicate in Manila, attested by three witnesses: Justo P. Torres, Jr., Jose V. Natividad, and Vinicio B. Diy [1]. She died on September 12, 1958 [1]. Celso Icasiano, the named executor, filed a petition for the probate of the will (Exhibit "A") [2, 3]. Natividad and Enrique Icasiano, children of the testatrix, filed oppositions claiming forgery, fraud, and undue influence [4, 5].

During the proceedings, it was discovered that the original will (Exhibit "A") lacked the signature of witness Jose V. Natividad on page 3, although it was signed on all other pages [6]. Consequently, Celso filed an amended petition submitting the executed carbon duplicate (Exhibit "A-1"), which bore the complete signatures of the testatrix and all witnesses on every page [6, 7]. Witness Natividad testified that he may have inadvertently lifted two pages simultaneously when signing the original [5]. The trial court admitted the will and its duplicate to probate [7]. The oppositors appealed directly to the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the will is void because one of the attesting witnesses failed to sign a page of the original document.
2. W/N the signature of the testatrix was forged.
3. W/N the execution of the will was tainted by fraud or undue influence.
4. W/N the admission of the duplicate will required a new publication.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The inadvertent failure of an attesting witness to affix his signature to one page of a testament, due to the simultaneous lifting of two pages in the course of signing, is not *per se* sufficient to justify denial of probate [8]. The Court found that the omission was pure oversight, proven by the witness's testimony and the duplicate copy (Exhibit "A-1") which bore a complete set of signatures [9]. The law should not be strictly interpreted to penalize the testatrix for the inadvertence of a witness over whom she had no control, provided the purpose of the law to guarantee the identity of the testament is attained [8]. The Court cited *Abangan v. Abangan* and *Lopez v. Liboro* to exemplify the policy against undue curtailment of testamentary privilege due to technical defects [9, 10].

2. **NO.** The Court rejected the oppositors' expert testimony regarding forgery because it relied on insufficient standards of comparison (only three signatures) and failed to account for the testatrix's advanced age and writing fatigue [11, 12]. The slight variance in ink color was attributed to the different types of paper used for the original and the duplicate [13].

3. **NO.** The contention that the will was procured through fraud or undue influence because some heirs were more favored than others was rejected. Diversity of apportionment is the usual reason for making a will [14]. Furthermore, allegations of fraud and undue influence are mutually repugnant; joining them shows an absence of definite evidence against the will's validity [14].

4. **NO.** The production of the signed carbon duplicate without new publication did not affect the probate court's jurisdiction [15]. The amended petition did not substantially alter the original petition but merely supplemented it by disclosing the duplicate's existence, and the oppositors were duly notified [15].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [16].
