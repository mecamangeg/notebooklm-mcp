I. CAPTION
LUZON STEVEDORING CO., INC., petitioner, vs. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, ET AL., respondents., G.R. No. L-19742, January 31, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Antonio Cordero was a sailor employed by Luzon Stevedoring Co., Inc. charged with watching a barge and its cargo. On September 11, 1956, he was left alone in charge of the barge [1]. Two days later, his body was found floating in the Pasig River; he had drowned while swimming with companions near where the barge was moored [1-3]. Within a few days of the death, the president of Cordero's union requested financial aid from the company, which was denied [4, 5]. The widow filed a formal claim for compensation on March 5, 1957, which was beyond the three-month period prescribed by law [4, 6]. The Hearing Officer awarded death benefits, and the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed the decision [4, 6]. The company appealed, arguing the claim was time-barred, the death did not arise in the course of employment, and the deceased was notoriously negligent [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claim is barred by prescription under Section 24 of Act 3428 (Workmen's Compensation Act).
2. W/N the death arose out of and in the course of employment.
3. W/N the deceased was guilty of notorious negligence.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the request for financial aid made by the union president within three months of the death constituted substantial compliance with Section 24 of Act 3428 [5, 7]. This request served as an "advance filing of claim," ensuring the company was not surprised and could prepare its defense [5].

2. **YES.** The Court held that while Cordero was swimming and not strictly on the barge, he died in the "line of duty" [2, 8]. Bathing is a necessary physiological need and a daily routine for a sailor living on a barge [9, 10]. Acts necessary for personal comfort (like eating, sleeping, or bathing) performed during the period of employment are incidental to the service, and accidents arising from them are compensable [10].

3. **NO.** The Court found no notorious negligence because Cordero was a swimmer and accustomed to the perils of water [11, 12]. Choosing to swim in the river rather than use a water tank on the barge was a routine preference, not negligence [13]. There was no clear evidence that the death was due to a cause he could have reasonably avoided [13].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [14].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS (if any)
Bengzon, C.J., concurs in the result [14].
