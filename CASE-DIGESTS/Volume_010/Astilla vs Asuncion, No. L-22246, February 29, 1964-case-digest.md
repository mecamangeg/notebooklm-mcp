I. CAPTION
VIRGINIO A. ASTILLA v. HON. ELIAS B. ASUNCION, CITY BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF TACLOBAN CITY, and BARTOLOME LAWSIN, G.R. No. L-22246, February 29, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Astilla was a candidate for councilor of Tacloban City in the November 12, 1963 general elections. On November 16, 1963, he filed a petition (Election Case No. 3415) with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte, presided by respondent Judge Asuncion, praying that the Board of Election Inspectors (BEI) of Precinct No. 65 be ordered to amend the election return [1]. Astilla alleged that respondent Lawsin was erroneously credited with 75 votes in the return instead of 65, as shown in the certificate of votes, and that this correction would alter the election results in Astilla's favor [1].

While the chairman and poll clerk expressed willingness to make the correction, the third member of the BEI, Consolacion Pensona, refused to consent, stating she would only agree if the error was confirmed by a recount [2, 3]. No recount was conducted as Astilla withdrew his petition for one [4]. The CFI denied Astilla's petition because the BEI members were not unanimous [5]. Astilla then filed this original action for certiorari with the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance may order the correction of election returns under Section 154 of the Revised Election Code despite the lack of unanimity among the members of the Board of Election Inspectors.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's denial, ruling that judicial authorization to correct election returns under Section 154 of the Revised Election Code requires that the members of the Board of Election Inspectors are unanimous on the existence of the error and are willing to rectify it [7].

Citing *Benitez v. Paredes* and *Gumpal v. Court of First Instance of Isabela*, the Court explained that Section 154 contemplates a summary and non-contentious proceeding to ensure the prompt canvass and proclamation of officials [8, 9]. Since Inspector Pensona did not admit the error and refused to consent to the correction without a recount, the court could not compel the correction [4, 10]. To do so would force an inspector to certify something she is unwilling to attest to [10].

The writ prayed for is DENIED and the case DISMISSED [11].
