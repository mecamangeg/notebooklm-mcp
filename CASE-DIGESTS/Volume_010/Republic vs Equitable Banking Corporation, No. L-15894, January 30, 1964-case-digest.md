I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. EQUITABLE BANKING CORPORATION (G.R. No. L-15894) and REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. THE BANK OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS (G.R. No. L-15895), January 30, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
From July to December 1952, the Corporacion de los Padres Dominicos acquired 24 treasury warrants from a former employee and deposited them with the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) "subject to collection only" [1, 2]. Similarly, Equitable Banking Corporation (Equitable) received four warrants from various depositors [3]. Both banks presented the warrants to the Government (drawee) through the Clearing Office of the Central Bank [2, 3]. The Treasurer of the Philippines cleared and paid the warrants, and the banks subsequently credited the proceeds to their respective depositors [3, 4].

In December 1952 and January 1953, the Treasurer returned the warrants to the Central Bank, claiming the signatures of the drawing office and the Auditor General's representative were forged, and demanded reimbursement [4]. The banks refused to return the value. The Republic filed complaints for recovery, but the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed them [3, 5]. The Republic appealed, arguing it is not bound by the "24-hour clearing house rule" and that the banks should bear the loss [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the "24-hour clearing house rule" applies to the Government Treasury.
2. W/N the Government can recover the value of the forged warrants from the defendant banks.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The "24-hour clearing house rule" applies to the Treasury. The Treasury is a member of the Clearing Office and documentary evidence showed it agreed to clear items through said office "subject to the rules and regulations of the Central Bank" [6]. The rule applies not only to banks but also to the "institutions" and entities alluded to therein [6].

2. **NO.** The loss is mainly imputable to the acts and omissions of the Treasury. The Treasury was negligent in clearing its own warrants, thereby inducing the banks to pay the amounts to their depositors [7]. The irregularity of the warrants was apparent on their face; specifically, the 24 warrants in the BPI case were for amounts exceeding P5,000, which was beyond the authority of the auditor whose signature was forged [7]. The Court applied the principle that "where a loss, which must be borne by one of two parties alike innocent of forgery, can be traced to the neglect or fault of either, it is reasonable that it would be borne by him... through whose means it has succeeded" (*Phil. National Bank v. National City Bank of New York*) [8]. Furthermore, a drawee bank's action is barred if it is guilty of unreasonable delay in discovering the forgery and giving notice [9].

**Decision affirmed** [10].
