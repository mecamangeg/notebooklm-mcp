I. CAPTION
JULIANA CALADIAO, ET AL. v. MAXIMA SANTOS VDA. DE BLAS, G.R. No. L-19063, April 29, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On September 30, 1932, Prudencio Limpin sold a fishpond to Simeon Blas (married to respondent Maxima Santos) via a *pacto de retro* sale. Limpin failed to repurchase the property within the one-year period, making Blas the absolute owner [1]. Blas and his wife took possession of the property and paid taxes on it [1]. However, on February 24, 1934, Limpin fraudulently applied for and obtained an Original Certificate of Title over the property in his name [2]. Upon Limpin's death in 1941, the title was transferred to his heirs, petitioners Juliana Caladiao and children [2].

Unaware of Limpin’s title, respondent Maxima Santos applied for registration of the same land in 1952. While her application was granted by the court, the decree could not be issued due to the existence of Limpin's prior title [3], [4]. Consequently, Maxima filed an action for reconveyance against the petitioners in 1954 [4]. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Maxima, ordering reconveyance. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, finding that Limpin sold the property to Blas and subsequently registered it in bad faith [5], [6]. Petitioners appealed, arguing that the decree of registration is indefeasible and that the action had prescribed [6], [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action for reconveyance is barred by the decree of registration issued in favor of the petitioners' predecessor.
2. W/N the action for reconveyance is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the existence of a decree of registration is not a bar to an action for reconveyance by the true owner, provided the registration was wrongful and the property has not passed to an innocent third party for value [8]. Since Limpin knew he had already sold the property to Blas, his subsequent application for registration was done in bad faith [9]. Consequently, he and his heirs held the title in trust for the true owners, the spouses Blas [9].

2. **NO.** The Court held that under Section 38 of Act 190 (Code of Civil Procedure), prescription does not apply to "continuing and subsisting trusts," rendering actions against a trustee to recover trust property imprescriptible [7]. Furthermore, the same section provides that prescription does not apply to an action by a vendee of real property in possession thereof to obtain its conveyance [10]. Since the Court of Appeals found that Blas and his successors had been in possession of the property since the sale, the action is not extinguished by prescription [10].

**The petition is denied, and the decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.**
