I. CAPTION
TEOFILO C. RODRIGUEZ v. DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19771, February 27, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
In May 1953, petitioner Teofilo Rodriguez entered into a loan agreement with the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (now DBP) for P14,000.00, payable in installments. He received the first release of P5,000.00 in May 1953. The subsequent releases for the remaining balance were received after June 1953, subject to conditions such as the percentage of construction completed and the availability of funds. On June 20, 1953, Republic Act No. 897 was approved, authorizing the payment of obligations subsisting at the time of its approval with backpay certificates.

Rodriguez offered to pay his entire obligation with his backpay certificate. DBP accepted the certificate for the initial P5,000.00 but refused to accept it for the releases made after June 1953. Rodriguez filed a complaint for mandamus to compel DBP to accept the payment. The Court of First Instance of Davao dismissed the complaint, ruling that the releases made after the approval of the Act were not subsisting obligations at that time. Rodriguez appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N DBP can be compelled to accept backpay certificates for loan releases made after the approval of R.A. No. 897 on June 20, 1953.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. The Court held that the loan agreement was an executory contract, and the petitioner became bound and liable for the amounts only on the date of their actual release and the signing of the corresponding promissory notes [1]. The obligation for each amount released subsists only from the date of such release [2].

Under Section 2 of R.A. No. 897, a government entity may be compelled to accept backpay certificates only for "obligations subsisting" at the time the Act was approved [3]. Since the subsequent releases were made after June 20, 1953, and were conditional upon factors like the availability of funds, they were not obligations subsisting at the time of the Act's approval [3, 4]. Consequently, DBP cannot be compelled to accept backpay certificates for these subsequent releases.

The decision appealed from is affirmed [5].
