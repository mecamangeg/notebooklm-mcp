I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PERCIVAL GILO, G.R. No. L-18202, April 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Appellant Percival Gilo was charged before the Justice of the Peace Court of Guimbal, Iloilo, with "Acts of Lasciviousness" based on a complaint filed by the offended party, Verna Genzola [1]. The complaint alleged that Gilo, while drunk, "intentionally, maliciously, feloniously, and criminally touch[ed] the breast and face" of the victim against her will [2]. However, the complaint did not allege "lewd design" [3].

The case was forwarded to the Court of First Instance (CFI), where the Provincial Fiscal filed an information for the same crime, this time alleging "lewd design" [1]. After the prosecution rested, Gilo filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction due to the defect in the original complaint [3]. The CFI deferred the motion, completed the trial, and convicted Gilo of unjust vexation, sentencing him to pay a fine of P20.00 [3]. Gilo appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance acquired jurisdiction over the case despite the failure to allege "lewd design" in the original complaint filed by the offended party.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that "lewd design" is an indispensable element of all crimes against chastity, such as abduction, seduction, rape, and acts of lasciviousness [4]. The general terms "feloniously and criminally" used in the complaint denote criminal intent but do not necessarily connote the idea of lust required for crimes against chastity [5]. The absence of this element converts the act into another crime, which in this case is unjust vexation [5].

Because the original complaint was fatally defective for failing to allege the specific element of lewd design, the CFI did not acquire jurisdiction over the charge of acts of lasciviousness [4]. This defect could not be cured by the information filed by the Fiscal; it could only be cured by a correction in the complaint filed by the offended party, which was not done [4]. Consequently, the proceedings in the lower court were null and void [4].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the case is remanded to the Justice of the Peace Court of Guimbal, Iloilo, to proceed under the complaint filed by the offended party [6].
