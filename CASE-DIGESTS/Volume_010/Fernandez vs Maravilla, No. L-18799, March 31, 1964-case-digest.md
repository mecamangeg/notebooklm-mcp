I. CAPTION
HON. JOSE F. FERNANDEZ, Judge of the Court of First Instance, Negros Occidental, ASUNCION MARAVILLA, ET AL. v. HERMINIO MARAVILLA, G.R. No. L-18799, March 31, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Herminio Maravilla filed a petition for the probate of the will of his deceased wife, Digna Maravilla, in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental. He was appointed special administrator of the estate, which consisted of conjugal property. Digna's siblings (petitioners) opposed the probate. The CFI eventually denied probate, and Herminio appealed. While the appeal was pending, the siblings petitioned for the appointment of Eliezar Lopez as a "special co-administrator" to protect their interests. The CFI granted this motion.

Herminio filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA) to annul the appointment. The CA assumed jurisdiction, reasoning that the amount in controversy was only about P90,000 (roughly 1/4 of the estate), and set aside the appointment. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the CA lacked jurisdiction because the value of the estate exceeded P200,000 (the jurisdictional limit at the time).

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction over the petition for certiorari regarding the appointment of the special co-administrator.
2. W/N the appointment of a special co-administrator is authorized under the Rules of Court.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction. In probate proceedings, the amount in controversy is the value of the *entire* estate, not merely the separate interest of the deceased or the parties. Under Section 2, Rule 75 of the Rules of Court, the entire conjugal partnership property is to be administered and liquidated in the testate or intestate proceedings of the deceased spouse [1]. Since the inventory showed the estate was valued at P362,424.90—exceeding the statutory limit of P200,000—the Supreme Court had exclusive jurisdiction over the main appeal and any incidental writs like certiorari [2, 3].

2. **NO.** The Rules of Court do not authorize the appointment of a "special co-administrator" [4]. The appointment of a special administrator is merely temporary, subsisting only until a regular executor or administrator is appointed. The Court held it unnecessary and impractical to appoint a stranger alongside the surviving spouse (who has the duty to liquidate community property) merely to protect the contingent interests of the heirs [4].

The decision of the Court of Appeals and the order of the trial court appointing the special co-administrator are SET ASIDE.
