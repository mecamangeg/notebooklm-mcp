I. CAPTION
ROBERTO LAPERAL, JR., ET AL. v. RAMON L. KATIGBAK, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16991, March 31, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Ramon Katigbak and Evelina Kalaw were married in 1938. In 1939, a property covered by TCT No. 57626 was registered in the name of "Evelina Kalaw-Katigbak, married to Ramon Katigbak."

Petitioners Roberto Laperal, Jr., et al. (the Laperals) had previously obtained a judgment against Ramon Katigbak for approximately P111,500.00 in Civil Case No. 11767. Seeking to enforce this judgment, the Laperals filed Civil Case No. 25235, asking the court to declare the subject property conjugal so it could be levied upon to satisfy Ramon's personal debts.

The trial court dismissed the complaint. On a previous appeal (G.R. No. L-11418), the Supreme Court remanded the case for the trial court to determine the specific nature of the property. Upon remand, the trial court declared the property to be the paraphernal property of Evelina, finding that: (1) Ramon's salary of P200.00/month as a bank attorney was insufficient to buy the property; (2) Evelina's mother, Pura Villanueva, provided the funds, consistent with her practice of buying properties for her children; and (3) Ramon had signed a document in 1939 expressly disclaiming any interest in the property [1-7]. The Laperals appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the property covered by TCT No. 57626 is conjugal property.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision. While Article 160 of the Civil Code establishes a presumption that all properties acquired during marriage are conjugal, this presumption is rebuttable and exists only "unless it be proved that it belongs exclusively to the husband or to the wife" [7].

In this case, the presumption was sufficiently rebutted by the following facts: (1) the title was in the name of the wife; (2) the husband did not have the financial means to purchase the property at the time; (3) the purchase price was furnished by the wife's mother; and (4) the husband executed a document stating he had no interest in the property [7, 8]. The Court relied on *Casiano v. Samaniego* and *Coingco v. Flores*, ruling that where the evidence proves the property was purchased with the wife's separate funds (or funds provided by her mother for her), the conjugal presumption is overcome [9-11].

The judgment of the lower court declaring the property as paraphernal was affirmed [12].
