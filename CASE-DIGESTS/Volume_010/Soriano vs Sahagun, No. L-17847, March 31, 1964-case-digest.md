I. CAPTION
MANUEL A. Q. SORIANO v. FIDEL SAHAGUN, G.R. No. L-17847, March 31, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On September 26, 1952, the Municipal Court of Manila rendered judgment in an ejectment case (Civil Case No. 22503) ordering Sahagun to vacate Soriano’s premises and pay rentals of P150.00 a month from October 1952 until he vacates. In 1956, Soriano filed a motion for execution. The court granted execution for prior arrears but denied it for the rentals from October 1952 to March 1953 (when Sahagun vacated), ruling that Soriano’s long delay in execution implied a renovation of the lease contract, converting the matter into a new obligation not covered by the judgment. Soriano did not appeal this Order, and it became final.

Subsequently, Soriano filed a separate collection suit (Civil Case No. 44043) and a petition for Mandamus to compel execution, but both were dismissed on grounds of *res judicata* and failure to appeal the 1956 Order, respectively. These dismissals also became final. In 1959, Soriano filed the present action (Civil Case No. 30653) to enforce/revive the 1952 judgment. The Court of First Instance ruled in Soriano's favor, holding that the prior decisions merely confirmed the original judgment remained controlling. Sahagun appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Soriano is barred by *res judicata* from collecting the rentals for the period of October 1952 to March 1953.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that *res judicata* had already set in. The specific question regarding Soriano's right to recover the alleged unpaid rentals for the period in question had been presented three times previously (in the motion for execution, the collection suit, and the mandamus petition) and was denied by courts of competent jurisdiction. These orders became final because Soriano failed to appeal them.

The Court emphasized that the prior courts had already made findings that novation took place. Even if those prior orders were incorrect, Soriano's failure to appeal made them conclusive. A party cannot litigate the same question in a future action between the same parties when it has been conclusively settled by final orders (*Tejedor v. Palet*). Furthermore, Soriano is subject to estoppel; having elected to pursue remedies that resulted in final adverse judgments, he cannot pursue an inconsistent remedy (*Three States Lumber Co. v. Blanks*).

The decision appealed from is reversed and the complaint is dismissed.
