I. CAPTION
NATALIO VENTOSA v. HON. WENCESLAO L. FERNAN, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, C. N. HODGES, RICARDO GURREA and JOSE DINEROS, as Receiver of the La Paz Ice Plant & Cold Storage Co., Inc., G.R. No. L-14941, January 31, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Natalio Ventosa claimed to be the lessee of the La Paz Ice Plant & Cold Storage Co., Inc., alleging he took possession of the premises on February 4, 1958 [1]. On September 24, 1958, respondents C.N. Hodges and Ricardo Gurrea filed Civil Case No. 4994 against the corporation's officers, leading to the appointment of respondent Jose Dineros as receiver [1]. Dineros took possession of the plant on September 27, 1958 [2].

Ventosa intervened in the civil case on October 8, 1958, and filed a motion to restrain the receiver from interfering with the management of the property, arguing that as a lessee, he was entitled to possession and the receiver was only entitled to the rentals [3]. The respondent Judge denied the motion on November 22, 1958, and the subsequent motion for reconsideration on December 23, 1958, ruling that the validity of the lease—which was questioned by the plaintiffs—must first be decided before Ventosa could assume control [4]. Ventosa filed a petition for certiorari, alleging the Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in refusing to restrain the receiver from controlling the property claimed by the petitioner-lessee pending the determination of the lease's validity.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that property under receivership is property in *custodia legis* and must remain under the administration and control of the receivership court, through the receiver, for the preservation and benefit of the party eventually adjudged entitled to it [6], [7].

The Court cited the principle that a receiver will not be ordered to deliver property to a claimant until the claimant's right is established through a regular hearing or trial [7]. Since the receiver was already in possession when Ventosa intervened, and the validity of Ventosa's lease was contested by the plaintiffs, the trial court correctly ruled that the issue of validity must be resolved in the civil case before possession could be surrendered [7], [8]. Consequently, the property must remain under the supervision of the court through its receiver until such rights are adjudicated [7].

The petition is dismissed; the Orders of the respondent Judge are affirmed, and the writ of preliminary injunction is dissolved [9].
