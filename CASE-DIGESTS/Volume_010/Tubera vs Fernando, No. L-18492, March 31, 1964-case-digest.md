**I. CAPTION**
**MAMERTO TUBERA, ET AL. v. MARGARITA FERNANDO**, G.R. No. L-18492, March 31, 1964, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners, tenants of respondent Margarita Fernando, filed a case with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) claiming that respondent refused to give their crop shares without just cause, exacted usurious interests on loans, and caused them damages [1]. The CAR rendered judgment against the petitioners, ordering them to pay the respondent specific amounts and rejecting their claims regarding transplanting expenses and usury [2, 3]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, raising issues concerning the proper interpretation of Republic Act No. 1199 and the appreciation of evidence regarding the alleged usury, harvest liquidation, and farm expenses [4, 5]. Petitioners explicitly admitted that the appeal involved mixed questions of fact and law [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to resolve an appeal from the Court of Agrarian Relations that involves mixed questions of fact and law.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that it did not have jurisdiction to resolve the factual issues raised. The Court ruled that under **Section 156 of the Agricultural Land Reform Code (Republic Act No. 3844)**, an appeal from a decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations that raises mixed factual and legal issues must be forwarded to the Court of Appeals, provided there are no questions regarding jurisdiction or constitutionality involved [7-9]. The Court noted that the legal questions raised by petitioners could not be resolved without reviewing the evidence and settling the factual disputes [6]. Consequently, the case was **FORWARDED** to the Court of Appeals for proper disposition [9].
