I. CAPTION
CATALINA ALBERCA Y BUSTILLO v. THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION FOR WOMEN, G.R. No. L-16896, January 31, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alberca was charged with theft and habitual delinquency before the Municipal Court of Manila. The information was filed at 2:15 PM on April 8, 1957, for a crime committed the previous day. At 10:00 PM that same evening, she was arraigned. She pleaded guilty and was immediately sentenced to *prision correccional* and an additional penalty of 10 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* for habitual delinquency.

On February 9, 1960, she filed a petition for habeas corpus, claiming a violation of due process because (1) she was not given sufficient time to prepare for her defense, citing the "two-day rule" under Rule 114, and (2) she was not represented by counsel. The Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissed the petition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner was denied due process because she was not given at least two days to prepare for trial.
2. W/N the petitioner was denied due process due to lack of counsel.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the rule (Section 7, Rule 114) granting a defendant at least two days to prepare for trial applies only when the defendant enters a plea of not guilty. A plea of guilty dispenses with the necessity of trial, and consequently, the time required to prepare for defense [1].

2. **NO.** The Court applied the presumption that official duty has been regularly performed and that the accused was duly informed of her right to secure counsel [2]. There was nothing in the record to rebut this presumption. The Court noted that the right to counsel may be waived by a voluntary plea of guilty [2]. Furthermore, citing *Talavera v. Superintendent*, even if the right to counsel were denied, it constitutes an error of law correctible by appeal, not by a petition for habeas corpus [3].

The judgment appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [4].
