I. CAPTION
ISMAEL CALMA v. HON. JUDGE DOMINGO M. CABAÑGON AND BEATRIZ VDA. DE FELICIANO, G.R. No. L-18664, March 31, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Feliciano, the landholder, filed a petition for ejectment and damages against her tenant, petitioner Calma, in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) for abandonment and negligence. On March 27, 1961, the CAR rendered a decision authorizing Calma's ejectment [1-3]. Calma's counsel received the decision on April 3, 1961, and filed a motion for reconsideration on April 15, 1961, after eleven (11) days of the appeal period had elapsed [4]. The motion was denied, and counsel was served a copy on May 11, 1961 [4]. The remaining period to appeal resumed on May 12, 1961 and expired on May 15, 1961 [4]. However, Calma filed the petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court only on May 18, 1961 [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court acquired jurisdiction to review the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that it did not acquire jurisdiction or possess authority to review the issues presented because the petition was filed three (3) days late [4]. The Court held that the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations had already become final before it was elevated to the Supreme Court [4]. Consequently, the appeal was time-barred.

Petition dismissed [5].
