I. CAPTION
AO LIN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18506, January 30, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Ao Lin, a Chinese national who arrived in the Philippines in 1929, filed a petition for naturalization [1]. The Court of First Instance of Manila granted the petition, finding him qualified [1]. The Solicitor General appealed, presenting records showing Ao Lin had faced various criminal and civil complaints, including a conviction for violating Sec. 288 of the National Internal Revenue Code for using a meter stick without the corresponding Internal Revenue seal, for which he paid a fine [2, 3]. He was also convicted of violating Sec. 86 of the Revised Ordinances of Manila [3, 4]. The lower court ruled that these offenses did not constitute impediments to naturalization as they did not involve moral turpitude [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the use of a meter stick without the corresponding Internal Revenue Office seal involves moral turpitude.
2. W/N the petitioner conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during his residence in the Philippines.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the use of a meter stick without the corresponding seal of the Internal Revenue Office by one who has been engaged in business for a long time constitutes an offense involving moral turpitude [6]. This act involves a fraudulent use of a measuring device and manifests an evil intent to defraud customers regarding the measurement of goods purchased, rather than merely cheating the government of revenue [6].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner failed to meet the requirement of Sec. 2, par. 3 of the Revised Naturalization Act (Com. Act No. 473) [7]. His convictions for offenses under city ordinances and the Tax Code, combined with the various civil and criminal violations complained of against him, conclusively show that he has not conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during his entire period of residence in the Philippines in his relation with the constituted government [7].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DISMISSED** [8].
