I. CAPTION
PRUDENTIAL BANK AND TRUST CO. v. SAURA IMPORT AND EXPORT CO., INC., G.R. No. L-19001, April 30, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On May 13, 1955, Prudential Bank filed a complaint against Saura Import and Export Co., Inc. to collect the unpaid balance of a draft amounting to P275,624.62 and to recover machineries covered by a trust receipt [1]. The defendant answered that novation had occurred via the trust receipt and that negotiations were ongoing [2]. During the trial, which spanned several years, the parties entered into an agreement where the Bank authorized the defendant to find a buyer for the machineries [3]. A buyer, Frank Halling, was found, and the Bank agreed to accept P250,000.00 in full liquidation of the principal and interest [3]. Crucially, the Bank granted Halling an extension until the end of 1961 to pay [4, 5]. On April 19, 1961, the trial court dismissed the case, ruling that the action was premature because the payment period had not yet expired [6, 7]. The Bank appealed directly to the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the complaint for being premature due to novation was proper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. While the amount was due when the complaint was filed, the Court held that novation took place through the subsequent negotiations entered into by the parties [8]. Specifically, the agreement granting the buyer, Frank Halling, an extension until 1961 to pay the settled amount of P250,000.00 rendered the controversy non-existent at the time of the lower court's decision in April 1961 [5]. Since the period of extension had not yet expired and there was no proof the debtor could not pay, the cause of action alleged in the complaint had lost its force and effect [5]. The decision appealed from is affirmed [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
J.B.L. Reyes, J., agreed with the decision but excepted as to the novatory effect of the Trust Receipts [9]. Justices Concepcion and Barrera concurred in the result [9].
