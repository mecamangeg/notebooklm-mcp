I. CAPTION
CMS ESTATE, INC. v. COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS and COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-18773, January 31, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner CMS Estate, Inc. sent a letter to the Collector of Customs of Davao City claiming that the collection of wharfage dues on their log shipments was illegal as there was no government wharf at Baganga, Davao. The Collector forwarded the letter to the Commissioner of Customs. The Commissioner returned the papers to the Collector via an endorsement, directing the Collector to inform the petitioner that the collection was in accordance with law and to strictly enforce the payment. The Commissioner also noted that the petitioner failed to file the mandatory written protest within 30 days of payment as required by the Tariff and Customs Code. Upon receiving this endorsement, the petitioner filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). The CTA dismissed the petition as premature.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the endorsement of the Commissioner of Customs constitutes a final decision appealable to the Court of Tax Appeals.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's dismissal. The Court ruled that the Commissioner's endorsement was a "mere opinion or directive" addressed to the Collector of Customs, not a final decision appealable to the CTA [1, 2]. Under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125, only final decisions of the Commissioner of Customs are appealable [3].

Furthermore, the Court highlighted that the petitioner failed to comply with the mandatory customs procedure under Sections 2308-2310 of the Tariff and Customs Code [4]. A written protest must be filed with the Collector at the time of payment or within 30 days thereafter [4]. Since the petitioner failed to file a protest, the Collector's assessment became final and conclusive, and there was no valid decision for the Commissioner to review or for the CTA to take cognizance of [4, 5]. The petition for review was denied.
