I. CAPTION
VICENTE D. SARMIENTO, in his capacity as the Judicial Administrator of the Intestate Estate of Lorenzo C. Atega v. THE HON. MONTANO A. ORTIZ, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Agusan, WILLIAM LASAM, MARCIANA E. LASAM and the PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, G.R. No. L-18583, January 31, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Lorenzo C. Atega filed a complaint against William and Marciana Lasam for the annulment of a certificate of title, causing a notice of *lis pendens* to be annotated on the title [1]. Atega subsequently died, and his counsel informed the court of the death, stating he would provide the names of the heirs once known [1, 2]. The court ordered the counsel to file an amended complaint for substitution, but the counsel claimed he never received this order [3, 4].

Later, the Lasams filed an urgent *ex parte* motion to cancel the notice of *lis pendens*, arguing that the delay in the case prevented them from mortgaging the property to the Philippine National Bank (PNB) [3, 5]. Respondent Judge Ortiz granted the motion [3]. Vicente D. Sarmiento, having been appointed administrator of Atega's estate, moved to set aside the order, but was denied [3]. Sarmiento filed a petition for certiorari, alleging grave abuse of discretion [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in ordering the cancellation of the notice of *lis pendens*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion [6]. While a trial court has discretionary power to cancel a notice of *lis pendens*, this power is limited to specific circumstances, such as when the notice is for the purpose of molesting the adverse party or is not necessary to protect the rights of the party who recorded it [7].

The Court found there was no unnecessary delay attributable to the plaintiff or his counsel [8]. The counsel complied with his duty by informing the court of the client's death [2]. It was the trial court's duty to order the legal representative to appear or, if none, to order the adverse party to procure the appointment of one [9]. Furthermore, the cancellation was unduly precipitated by an *ex parte* motion without notice to the plaintiff's counsel [8]. Regarding PNB's mortgage claim, the Court held that transactions subsequent to the notice of *lis pendens* are subject to the outcome of the litigation, while rights previously acquired remain unaffected [6].

The petition was granted, and the order directing the cancellation of the notice of *lis pendens* was annulled [7].
