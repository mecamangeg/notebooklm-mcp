I. CAPTION
FELIX V. ESPINO v. PEDRO M. GIMENEZ, Auditor General of the Republic of the Philippines and JUAN M. MATUTINA, Corporation Auditor, National Power Corporation, G.R. No. L-18271, April 30, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Espino, the Chief of the Chemical Fertilizer Department of the National Power Corporation (NPC), retired under Republic Act No. 1616. NPC granted him a retirement gratuity of P17,150.00 [1]. However, Respondent NPC Auditor Matutina refused to issue a clearance certificate because Espino had authorized the release of 4,000 bags of fertilizer to a customer, Villanueva, whose check for P25,640.00 was later dishonored [1, 2]. Villanueva was charged with estafa [2]. Respondent Auditor General Gimenez held Espino negligent and ruled that his clearance be held in abeyance pending settlement of the account or termination of the estafa case [3]. Notably, NPC management itself investigated and found Espino acted in good faith, declaring he should not be held liable for the unpaid account [4]. Espino appealed the Auditor General's ruling to the Supreme Court. Respondents moved to dismiss, arguing Espino was not a private person and the petition was not a money claim [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a retired government employee may appeal the Auditor General's decision to the Supreme Court.
2. W/N the Auditor General may withhold retirement gratuity to set off an alleged indebtedness that is contested by the employee and the government agency.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Upon retirement, the petitioner became a private individual and is entitled to appeal the Auditor General's decision [5]. Furthermore, a petition seeking the approval of retirement gratuity is considered a money claim against the Republic of the Philippines [6, 7].

2. **NO.** Under Section 624 of the Revised Administrative Code, the Auditor General may set off only an *uncontested* indebtedness in favor of the Government against a settled money claim [8]. The Court, citing *Compañia General de Tabacos v. French and Unson*, held that the authority to set off debts does not extend to unliquidated, disputed claims arising from tort or breach of contract [9]. In this case, Espino's alleged liability is denied not only by him but also by the NPC management itself [10]. Consequently, the government's claim is unliquidated and cannot be summarily set off against the liquidated retirement gratuity; any liability must be enforced through separate court proceedings [10].

Petition GRANTED. Respondents are ordered to issue the clearance certificate and approve payment of the retirement gratuity [7].
