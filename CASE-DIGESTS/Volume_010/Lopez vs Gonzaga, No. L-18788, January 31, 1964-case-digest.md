I. CAPTION
ROMULO LOPEZ, et al. v. LUIS GONZAGA, et al., G.R. No. L-18788, January 31, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Soledad Gonzaga Vda. de Ferrer died in 1935. In 1958, plaintiffs-appellants (her nearest of kin) filed a petition for partition and cancellation of titles against defendant-appellee Luis Gonzaga, alleging Soledad died intestate and Luis fraudulently transferred titles to his name. Luis asserted he was the sole testamentary heir under a will probated in 1936 (Sp. Proc. No. 2163, CFI Iloilo). While the original probate records were destroyed in WWII, Luis presented secondary evidence, including judicial orders and sworn petitions from 1936 by the plaintiffs' own relative (Atty. Hortillas), showing the will's probate and the adjudication of the estate to Luis. Luis had transferred titles to his name in 1936 and possessed the properties adversely as owner for over 20 years. The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs' petition, finding the will had been probated, but denied Luis's claim for moral damages. Both parties appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defendant's title is valid despite the destruction of the original will and the failure to strictly comply with recording requirements.
2. W/N the defendant held the property in trust for the plaintiffs, preventing prescription.
3. W/N the plaintiffs were denied their day in court due to alleged lack of authority of their counsel.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the destruction of the will and probate decree does not invalidate the defendant's title given the conclusive proof of probate found in the surviving judicial orders [1, 2]. The order of adjudication confirmed the testamentary institution of the heir [3, 4]. Furthermore, the failure to file a certified copy of the will with the Register of Deeds as provided in Section 90 of Act 496 and Section 624 of Act 190 does not negate the validity of the probate decree [5, 6]. The recording of the judicial orders authorizing the transfer of titles to the defendant was substantial compliance and served as sufficient notice to interested parties [5, 6].

2. **NO.** The Court rejected the theory of a continuing trust as "infantile" [7, 8]. No administration could continue after the court approved the final account and ordered the case closed in 1936 [7, 8]. Moreover, the transfer of certificates of title to the defendant's own name in 1936 constituted an open and clear repudiation of any trust [7, 8]. The lapse of more than twenty years of open and adverse possession vested title by prescription in the defendant, and plaintiffs are barred by laches for failing to act despite knowledge of the death [7, 8].

3. **NO.** The plaintiffs were represented by counsel throughout the proceedings, and his authority was presumed and never questioned until after the adverse decision was rendered [9, 10]. This claim was deemed a last-minute attempt to escape the effect of the decision [9, 10].

Decision affirmed.
