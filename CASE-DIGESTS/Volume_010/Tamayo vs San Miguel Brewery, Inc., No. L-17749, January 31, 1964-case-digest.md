I. CAPTION
VICENTE TAMAYO v. SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC., G.R. No. L-17749, January 31, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellant Vicente Tamayo filed a complaint against defendant-appellee San Miguel Brewery, Inc. following his dismissal from the company on July 3, 1958. San Miguel Brewery moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila lacked jurisdiction and that the complaint failed to state a cause of action as Tamayo had not resorted to the grievance procedure. The lower court dismissed the complaint on July 11, 1959. Tamayo moved for reconsideration and leave to amend his complaint to specifically allege that his dismissal violated the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) and company rules, which mandated "just and valid cause" for dismissal. San Miguel Brewery opposed, contending that a complaint dismissed for lack of jurisdiction could not be amended to cure the defect.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance (regular court) has jurisdiction over a simple claim for reinstatement without allegations of Unfair Labor Practice.
2. W/N the amendment of the complaint was proper to cure the defect in the cause of action.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of First Instance has jurisdiction. The Supreme Court held that for the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to acquire jurisdiction, there must be both an employer-employee relationship (or a claim for reinstatement) AND a controversy involving Unfair Labor Practice (ULP), the Minimum Wage Law, the Eight-Hour Labor Law, or a case certified by the President involving national interest [1]. Since Tamayo's claim for reinstatement did not allege any ULP or statutory labor law violation, it is a mere money claim cognizable by the regular courts [2, 3].

2. **YES.** The amendment was proper. The Supreme Court ruled that while a complaint cannot be amended to *confer* jurisdiction where none existed, in this case, the CFI already had jurisdiction over the subject matter. The amendment merely cured the defect in the allegation of the cause of action by pleading the CBA provision restricting the employer's right to dismiss [4]. Thus, the trial court did not err in allowing the amendment to plead the existence of the CBA [5].

The decision and order appealed from are **REVERSED**.
