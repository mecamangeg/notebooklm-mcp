I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JOSEPH ARCACHE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15547, February 29, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) assessed Arcache for deficiency income tax for the year 1946 using the net worth method. Arcache requested several reinvestigations and extensions of time to pay, admitted his liability in writing, and made partial payments. On August 23, 1955, Arcache (as principal) and Globe Assurance Co. (as surety) executed a bond to secure the tax payment. Arcache claimed he was compelled to execute the bond as a condition for the issuance of a tax clearance he needed for travel abroad. When Arcache failed to pay despite final demand, the Republic filed an action for the forfeiture of the bond. The Court of First Instance of Manila rendered judgment ordering Arcache and the surety to pay the tax liability. Arcache appealed, arguing that the bond was obtained through coercion and that the collection of the tax had prescribed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the surety bond is void because it was obtained through coercion.
2. W/N the government’s right to collect the tax is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Bureau of Internal Revenue was perfectly within its right to demand the filing of a bond as a condition for the issuance of a tax clearance. Consequently, the defense that such a requirement amounted to coercion is untenable [1].

2. **NO.** The taxpayer is barred from invoking the defense of prescription based on the following circumstances: (1) the delay in collection was due to his own repeated requests for reinvestigation and extensions of time (*Collector v. Suyoc Consolidated Mining Company*); (2) he admitted the tax obligation in writing and made partial payments; (3) the action is based on the written bond, which acts as a contractual obligation with a 10-year prescriptive period that had not yet elapsed; and (4) the execution of the bond amounts to a renewal of the tax obligation and a waiver of the defense of prescription (*Sambrano v. Court of Tax Appeals*) [2-4].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED [5].
