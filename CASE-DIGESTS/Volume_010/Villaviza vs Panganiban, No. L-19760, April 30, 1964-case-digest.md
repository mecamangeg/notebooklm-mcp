I. CAPTION
MARCELO VILLAVIZA, ET AL. v. JUDGE TOMAS PANGANIBAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19760, April 30, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondents (Jose Aguilar, et al.) were tenants on a rice land in Aliaga, Nueva Ecija, owned by Domingo Fajardo since 1944 [1]. In 1955, Fajardo leased the land to petitioner Quirino Capalad. In June 1955, Capalad mechanized the cultivation and installed his own tenants (petitioners Marcelo Villaviza, et al.), thereby ousting the respondents [2]. Respondents demanded reinstatement annually, and Capalad repeatedly promised to reinstate them the following agricultural year but failed to do so [2].

On March 31, 1960, respondents filed a case in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) [3]. The CAR ruled in favor of respondents, ordering Capalad to pay damages and ordering Villaviza, et al. to vacate the land [1, 4]. Petitioners appealed, claiming the CAR abused its discretion, that the findings lacked evidence, and implicitly arguing that the action was barred by the lapse of time [3, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action for violation of the tenant's security of tenure had prescribed.
2. W/N the earnings of the ejected tenants from other sources should be deducted from the damages awarded.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that a tenant's right to be respected in his tenure is an obligation created by law under Republic Act No. 1199. Under Article 1144 (No. 2) of the Civil Code, an action based upon an obligation created by law prescribes in ten (10) years [3]. Since the respondents were ousted in June 1955 and filed the action on March 31, 1960, the period of limitation had not expired [3]. Furthermore, respondents were not guilty of laches because the delay was attributable to Capalad's unfulfilled promises of reinstatement [6].

2. **NO.** Under Section 27(1) of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended, a tenant's freedom to earn elsewhere is to be added to, not deducted from, his right to damages in case of illegal ejectment [6]. The Court noted that the lower court erred in limiting the damages based on the tenants' gainful occupation, but since the respondents did not appeal the decision, the amount of the award was not disturbed [7].

Decision affirmed [7].
