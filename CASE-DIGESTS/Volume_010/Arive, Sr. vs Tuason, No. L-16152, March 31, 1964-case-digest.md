I. CAPTION
JOSE ARIVE, SR. v. HON. VICENTE S. TUASON, G.R. No. L-16152, March 31, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On September 29, 1958, the Chief of Police of Naga City sent a letter-complaint to the City Attorney charging petitioner Jose Arive, Sr. with frustrated murder [1]. The City Attorney questioned witnesses, found a *prima facie* case, and filed an information with the Municipal Court of Naga (presided by respondent Judge Tuason) specifically for the purpose of conducting a preliminary investigation [1].

The Municipal Court conducted the first stage of the preliminary investigation, found probable cause, and issued a warrant of arrest. Arive posted bail [1]. During the second stage, Arive moved to have the case remanded to the City Attorney, arguing that under the Charter of the City of Naga, the City Attorney—not the Municipal Court—had the exclusive jurisdiction to conduct preliminary investigations [2]. The Municipal Court denied the motion. Arive filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur, which dismissed the petition [2]. Arive appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipal Court of Naga City has jurisdiction to conduct the preliminary investigation for the crime charged.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the Municipal Court has jurisdiction to conduct the preliminary investigation [3].

Under Section 77 of the Charter of the City of Naga (Republic Act No. 305), the Municipal Court is expressly authorized to "conduct preliminary investigation for any offense, without regard to the limits of punishment" [4]. While Section 24, paragraph F of the same Charter empowers the City Attorney to investigate charges of crimes and prepare necessary informations [5], the Court held that even viewing the issue most favorably to the petitioner, any jurisdiction the City Attorney possesses to conduct preliminary investigations is merely **concurrent** with that of the Municipal Court [6].

Furthermore, the City Attorney in this case exercised his authority to investigate and file the information with the Municipal Court specifically for the latter to conduct the preliminary investigation [7]. Therefore, the Municipal Court properly assumed jurisdiction.

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [3].
