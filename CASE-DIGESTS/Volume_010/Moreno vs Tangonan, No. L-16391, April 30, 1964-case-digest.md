I. CAPTION
HECTOR MORENO v. MACARIO TANGONAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16391, April 30, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Tangonan and Tagatac were share tenants of petitioner Moreno in Nueva Ecija under registered contracts effective from June 1, 1956, to May 31, 1957. The agreed sharing ratio was 55-45 in favor of respondents, with expenses shared equally. At the start of the 1957-1958 agricultural year, respondents refused to renew the contracts and proceeded with cultivation, shouldering all expenses for harrowing and transplanting while rejecting petitioner's offer to pay his share. In September 1957, respondents demanded a change in the sharing ratio to 70-30. Petitioner refused, and the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) eventually ruled that the 55-45 ratio must stand for that year because the demand was untimely. Petitioner then filed a petition to eject respondents, arguing that their refusal to accept his share of expenses violated the terms of their tenancy contracts, constituting grounds for ejectment under Section 50(b) of Republic Act No. 1199. The CAR dismissed the petition, ruling the tenants acted in good faith.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the tenants' refusal to accept the landholder's share of expenses and late demand to change the sharing ratio constitute a violation of the tenancy contract sufficient to justify ejectment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court. The Court held that while the respondents attempted to exercise their right to change the crop-sharing ratio too late (September 1957), they acted in **good faith**. Their refusal to renew contracts at the start of the agricultural year and their act of shouldering all cultivation expenses served as sufficient notice to the landholder of their desire to modify the original contracts. Although this procedural mistake was sufficient to deprive them of the right to change the sharing ratio for that specific agricultural year, it was not a sufficient violation of the tenancy contracts to justify ejectment under **Section 50, paragraph (b) of Republic Act No. 1199**.

Petition denied; decision affirmed.
