**I. CAPTION**
URBANO SAPICO, ET AL. v. MANILA OCEANIC LINES, INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-18776, January 30, 1964, Labrador, J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiffs, comprising the officers and crew of a vessel, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against Manila Oceanic Lines, Inc. to collect unpaid wages and damages [2, 3]. The complaint alleged three causes of action: (1) P24,570.76 for unpaid wages; (2) P111,000.00 in total moral damages, specifically apportioned as P10,000.00 for the Master (Captain), P5,000.00 for each marine officer, and P2,000.00 for each crew member; and (3) P5,000.00 for attorney’s fees [3]. The CFI ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, ordering the defendant to pay the unpaid wages and attorney's fees [2]. The defendant appealed, arguing that the CFI lacked jurisdiction because if the total claim of P140,570.76 were divided among the 38 plaintiffs, each individual claim would only be approximately P3,699.23, an amount below the CFI's jurisdictional threshold [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction over the case. [3]

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court found the defendant's contention without merit. The Court held that jurisdiction was properly vested in the Court of First Instance because the second cause of action specifically alleged that the Captain demanded P10,000.00 as damages, in addition to his claimed pay [3]. Because the amount claimed by at least one of the parties joined in the complaint fell within the jurisdiction of the court, the CFI had authority to hear the case [3-5]. The decision appealed from is affirmed [6].
