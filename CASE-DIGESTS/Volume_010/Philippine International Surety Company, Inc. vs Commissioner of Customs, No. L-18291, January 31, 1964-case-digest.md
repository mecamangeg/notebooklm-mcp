I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE INTERNATIONAL SURETY COMPANY, INC. v. COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-18291, January 31, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On December 22, 1954, a shipment of candy consigned to Manuel Santos arrived in Manila but was seized by the Collector of Customs for lacking a Central Bank release certificate and consular invoices. The merchandise was subsequently released to Santos upon his posting of Surety Bond No. 194, subscribed by petitioner Philippine International Surety Co., Inc., in the amount of P1,785.05. On October 4, 1955, the Collector of Customs rendered a decision requiring the payment of the bond amount. While Santos appealed this decision to the Commissioner of Customs, the petitioner surety did not. On January 14, 1960, the Commissioner affirmed the Collector's decision, confiscating the bond and ordering Santos and the petitioner to pay the amount jointly and severally. The petitioner then filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). The CTA dismissed the petition, ruling that the petitioner lacked legal capacity to sue because it had failed to appeal the Collector's decision to the Commissioner.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner surety has standing to appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals despite failing to appeal the Collector of Customs' decision to the Commissioner of Customs.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that since the petitioner failed to appeal the decision of the Collector of Customs to the Commissioner of Customs as required by Section 1380 of the Revised Administrative Code, the decision became final and executory as to the petitioner [1]. Consequently, the petitioner lost its standing to institute a petition for review in the Court of Tax Appeals [1]. The Court applied the doctrine in *Sampaguita Shoe & Slipper Factory v. Commissioner of Customs*, ruling that a party who fails to interpose an appeal to the Commissioner within the prescribed period cannot take the case to the CTA [1], [2]. Although the principal, Santos, appealed, the unsuccessful result bound the surety [3].

The Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [4].
