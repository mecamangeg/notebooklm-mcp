I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE ASSOCIATION OF FREE LABOR UNIONS (PAFLU) and CIPRIANO CID v. SERGIO BOGNOT, RENATO CORONADO, and THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-19420, January 31, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Sergio Bognot and Renato Coronado filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against petitioners PAFLU and Cipriano Cid. They alleged that they were expelled from the union without due process and were not reinstated despite demands, violating Section 17 of Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act) [1].

Petitioners filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction and cause of action. They argued that Section 17 of R.A. No. 875 requires a report by a minimum of 10% of the members of a labor organization to file a case regarding violations of internal procedures, and the two respondents did not meet this requirement [2]. The CIR deferred the resolution of the motion to dismiss until trial, stating that the grounds relied upon were not indubitable [3]. After their motion for reconsideration was denied, petitioners filed this petition for certiorari [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR has jurisdiction to entertain a complaint regarding internal union procedures filed by less than 10% of the union membership.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the CIR lacked jurisdiction. Section 17 of Republic Act No. 875 expressly requires "a minimum of ten per cent of the members of a labor organization (who) may report an alleged violation of this procedure in their labor organization to the Court" [4].

In this case, only two members (Bognot and Coronado) appeared as complainants. This number was clearly short of the requisite 10% minimum prescribed by law [4]. Consequently, the defect was apparent on the face of the complaint, showing indubitably that the matter was beyond the cognizance of the CIR. The lower court should have dismissed the case outright instead of deferring the determination of the motion to dismiss [4].

Petition granted; order and resolution set aside; complaint dismissed [5].
