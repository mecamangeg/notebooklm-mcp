I. CAPTION
ALFREDO CERBO v. HON. GREGORIO D. MONTEJO and WATTS SELECTIVE PHILIPPINE TIMBER CO., INC., G.R. No. L-19881, January 31, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alfredo Cerbo obtained a favorable decision from the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) on February 17, 1961, ordering respondent Watts Selective Philippine Timber Co., Inc. to pay compensation for the death of his son. The award became final and executory. Pursuant to Section 51 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, Cerbo filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga City to enforce the award, attaching a certified copy of the decision [1, 2]. Respondent Judge Montejo denied the petition, ruling that Cerbo must file a "separate action" for the court to acquire jurisdiction to issue a writ of execution [3]. Cerbo filed a petition for Mandamus. Respondents also argued that the Zamboanga City court lacked jurisdiction because the accident occurred in Basilan City [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a separate formal complaint is necessary to enforce a final WCC award.
2. W/N the petition should be dismissed for improper venue.

IV. RULING
1. **NO**. The Court held that under Section 51 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, "all that the law requires is the filing in the proper court of a certified copy of the decision or award with a certification that no appeal has been taken therefrom." [5] No other pleading or formal complaint is necessary. The proceeding is not a trial on the merits but a summary proceeding intended to elevate the administrative award into a judicial judgment for execution [6]. The court's duty upon such filing is to render a decree or judgment in accordance with the award [5].

2. **NO**. While the law provides that the award may be filed in "any court of record in the jurisdiction of which the accident occurred," the Court ruled that the word "jurisdiction" in this context refers to venue, not jurisdiction over the subject matter [4]. Since the objection regarding wrong venue was not raised in the lower court, it is deemed waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal [4, 7, 8].

Petition is **GRANTED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred with the decision [9].
