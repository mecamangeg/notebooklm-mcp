I. CAPTION
GENARO PRADO v. APOLINARIO CALPO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19370, April 30, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On May 24, 1957, petitioner Genaro Prado filed a forcible entry case against respondents Apolinario Calpo, et al. in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of San Jacinto, Pangasinan [1]. The respondents filed an Answer claiming that one of them, Dalmacio Cabrera, was the registered owner of the property under TCT No. 23006 and argued that the JP Court lacked jurisdiction as the case involved a question of title [1]. The JP Court ruled in favor of Prado, finding that he had prior physical possession and that the issue in forcible entry is possession de facto, independent of ownership [2, 3].

The respondents appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan [4]. On December 17, 1958, without a hearing, the CFI granted the respondents' motion to dismiss [4]. The CFI ruled that because the land was covered by a certificate of title in the respondents' names, the issue necessarily involved ownership, depriving the court of jurisdiction [4-6]. Prado appealed to the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CFI erred in dismissing the forcible entry case on the ground that the claim of ownership deprived the lower court of jurisdiction.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the CFI erred in quashing the case upon a mere motion to dismiss without a hearing on the merits [8]. The findings of the JP Court clearly showed that Prado had prior physical possession of the disputed property [8]. The Court emphasized that the circumstance of the defendant being the registered owner does not detract from the fact that the plaintiff had a right of possession which should be protected [8, 9]. In an action for forcible entry, the remedy lies even against the very owner of the property, as the issue is limited to physical possession [8]. The CFI should have determined whether the JP Court's findings on prior possession were correct rather than dismissing the case based on ownership, which is an issue that should be threshed out in a separate action to quiet title [8].

The Order of the CFI is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **REMANDED** to the court of origin for further proceedings [10].
