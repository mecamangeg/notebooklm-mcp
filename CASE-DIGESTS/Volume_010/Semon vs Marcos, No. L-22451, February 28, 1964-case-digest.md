I. CAPTION
GILBERT SEMON, ET AL. v. HON. PIO R. MARCOS and HEIRS OF SIOCO CARIÑO, G.R. No. L-22451, February 28, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Semon et al. were oppositors in a land registration proceeding involving a 100-hectare parcel applied for by the Heirs of Sioco Cariño [1]. Petitioners claimed ownership of small lots scattered within this area, alleging under oath in their amended opposition that they were in "actual, open, continuous, exclusive, notorious, and peaceful possession" of said lots [2]. They filed motions seeking judicial authority to survey their specific lots, but respondent Judge Marcos denied the request [1, 3]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that the Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in denying the authority to survey [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners require court authority to survey the lots they claim to be in actual possession of.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that court authority is unnecessary. The Court reasoned that since the petitioners alleged under oath that they were in actual and peaceful possession of the lots, it is clear they could "make the survey at any time without asking leave of court" [2]. The Court clarified that petitioners need only seek a remedy in a competent court if their right to survey is "impeded by force or other unlawful means" [2]. Consequently, the petition was dismissed for lack of merit [2].
