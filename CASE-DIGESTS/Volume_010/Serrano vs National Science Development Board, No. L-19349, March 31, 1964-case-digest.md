**I. CAPTION**
FELICISIMO B. SERRANO, ET AL. v. THE NATIONAL SCIENCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19349, March 31, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Felicisimo Serrano was appointed Director of the Rice Research and Development Project No. 2.10 under the National Science Board (created by R.A. 1606), employing emergency and temporary staff. Upon the enactment of the Science Act of 1958 (R.A. 2067), the National Science Development Board (NSDB) replaced the former board, absorbing its projects [1, 2]. On August 13, 1959, the NSDB resolved to discontinue Project 2.10 effective December 31, 1959, determining it had reached the commercial stage and was now the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture Seed Board [2]. Despite receiving notice, Serrano and his staff refused to recognize the decision and continued working, arguing that under Section 30 of R.A. 2067, the NSDB was mandated to continue projects initiated by its predecessor [2]. They filed a suit for salaries and wages for services rendered after the termination date. The Municipal Court and the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the NSDB has the authority to terminate the project and refuse payment of salaries for services rendered after the termination date.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The NSDB has the power to review, continue, or terminate projects. The Supreme Court held that while Section 30 of R.A. 2067 provides that projects "shall be continued," this does not mandate indefinite continuation regardless of necessity [4]. The NSDB is vested with broad discretion to analyze inherited projects and terminate those that have accomplished their objectives or failed [4]. Consequently, the petitioners are not entitled to salaries for services rendered in defiance of the Board's resolution after the valid termination date [5]. Furthermore, as emergency or temporary employees, the petitioners had no definite tenure and could be terminated at will (*Austria v. Amante*) [6]. The Court also noted that a directive from the President to continue the project was merely persuasive and could not nullify the Board's statutory authority [7].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [5].
