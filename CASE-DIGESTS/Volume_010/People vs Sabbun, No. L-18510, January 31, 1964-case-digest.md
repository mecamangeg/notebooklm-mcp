I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ALBERTO M. SABBUN, G.R. No. L-18510, January 31, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Alberto M. Sabbun assisted the spouses Benito and Juana Dacquioag in preparing and prosecuting their claims for benefits with the United States Veterans Administration regarding the death of their son. In violation of Republic Act No. 145, Sabbun collected excessive fees on multiple occasions: P600.00 in December 1949, P1,480.00 in monthly deductions from January 1950 to February 1956, and P170.00 from March 1956 to September 1957 [1].

On January 19, 1959, an Information was filed against Sabbun. He moved to quash the Information, arguing that the criminal action had been extinguished by prescription regarding the earlier collections. The Court of First Instance of Cagayan sustained the motion to quash with respect to collections made four years prior to the filing of the Information [2, 3]. The Republic appealed, contending that the acts constituted a continuing offense [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the periodic collection of excessive attorney's fees constitutes a continuing offense such that prescription has not set in against the earlier collections.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the offense charged is a continuing offense [4]. The various collections made from 1949 to 1957 are integral parts of the fees agreed upon for the services rendered by the accused [4]. These periodical collections form part of a single criminal offense impelled by the same motive and criminal impulse [4].

Citing *People vs. Lawas*, the Court ruled that only one offense was committed [4]. Since the last act of collection was made within the prescriptive period, the offense had not prescribed at the time the Information was filed [4].

The order appealed from is **SET ASIDE**, and the lower court is ordered to proceed with the case [5].
