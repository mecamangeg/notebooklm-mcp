I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE OF PAZ E. SIGUION TORRES, deceased, ALBERTO S. TORRES v. CONCHITA TORRES and ANGEL S. TORRES, G.R. No. L-19064, January 31, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Paz E. Siguion Torres died intestate on December 18, 1959. Her four legitimate children—Alberto, Angel, Eduardo, and Conchita—executed an extrajudicial partition of the estate on January 27, 1960, pursuant to Section 1, Rule 74 of the Rules of Court, stipulating that the deceased left no debts. On January 4, 1961, Alberto Torres filed a petition for the issuance of letters of administration, initially claiming he was unaware of any debts but later arguing that the heirs could not agree on the physical division of the properties. In a supplemental answer to the opposition filed by Conchita and Angel, Alberto alleged an existing debt of P50,000 and the exclusion of certain properties from the partition, though these claims were unverified. The Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissed the petition on the ground that an extrajudicial settlement had already been executed. Alberto appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a special proceeding for the administration of the estate is necessary.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. Under Section 1, Rule 74 of the Rules of Court, where the decedent left no debts and the heirs are all of age, there is no necessity for the institution of special proceedings or the appointment of an administrator, as the estate may be settled extrajudicially or through an ordinary action for partition [1, 2].

The Court held that the heirs' inability to agree on the physical division of the estate does not justify a special proceeding; the proper remedy is an ordinary action for partition [2]. Furthermore, the Petitioner's bare, unverified allegation of a P50,000 debt, without specifying the creditor, was insufficient to constitute a cause of action for administration [3]. Questions regarding excluded properties or title thereto can also be expeditiously litigated in an ordinary action for partition [4].

The Order of the lower court is affirmed [5].
