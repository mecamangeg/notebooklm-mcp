I. CAPTION
PLYWOOD INDUSTRIES, INC., petitioner, vs. JOSE ARAÑAS, as Collector of Internal Revenue, respondent, G.R. No. L-16466, March 31, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Plywood Industries, Inc. is a domestic corporation engaged in the manufacture of plywood panels and veneer sheets [1]. It was granted a tax exemption for this "new and necessary industry" under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 35, later extended under R.A. No. 901 [1]. While petitioner initially sourced logs from a sister company, it later acquired its own timber concessions to supply the logs needed for its products [2]. From 1953 to 1957, petitioner paid forest charges totaling P159,025.40 on logs removed from these concessions [2]. Petitioner requested a refund, arguing that forest charges are taxes covered by the exemption under R.A. 901 [2]. The Respondent Collector of Internal Revenue denied the request [2]. On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals affirmed the Collector's decision, ruling against the refund [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N forest charges paid by the petitioner are included in the tax exemption granted under R.A. No. 901.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that the forest charges are not covered by the exemption [4].

Under Section 1 of R.A. No. 901, an exemption applies only to "taxes directly payable... in respect to said industry" [5]. Citing the doctrine in *Collector of Internal Revenue v. Lacson*, the Court held that the operation of a forest concession is a business distinct from the manufacture of plywood and veneer [6]. While logs are necessary materials, operating a concession to obtain them is not indispensable to the manufacturing industry, as logs can be purchased from other concessionaires [6]. Therefore, forest charges arising from the concession operation are not taxes "directly payable in respect to" the new and necessary industry of manufacturing plywood and veneer [7, 8].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [4].
