I. CAPTION
HADJI AZIZ LUMNA TANGO v. ALEJANDRO, G.R. No. L-22342, March 31, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tango was a candidate for mayor in Saguiaran, Lanao del Sur. A material discrepancy appeared in the election returns for Precinct No. 5: the official copy in the possession of the Municipal Treasurer recorded 171 votes for Tango, while the official copy with the Nacionalista Party recorded only 131 votes [1]. The board of election inspectors and the poll clerk formally requested the Court of First Instance, presided by respondent Judge Alejandro, for permission to correct the Treasurer's copy, admitting that "171" was a clerical error and that the true number of votes was 131 [1]. Tango then asked the court to open the ballot box and recount the votes [1]. After hearing the evidence and the unanimous request of the inspectors, the Judge authorized the correction of the return to 131 votes and consequently refused to order a judicial recount [1]. Tango filed this petition alleging the refusal constituted grave abuse of discretion.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to order a judicial recount of the ballots.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the refusal to require a recounting of the ballots was not improper [2]. The clerical error in the official copy of the election returns was properly shown during a hearing before the Judge, where all members of the board of inspectors and the poll clerk explicitly asked for the correction [1]. Since the Judge authorized the board to make the correction based on this proper showing and the admission of the inspectors, the official returns were rectified to reflect the true vote count without need for a recount [1, 3]. Therefore, grave abuse of discretion could not be imputed to the respondent Judge for declining to reopen the ballot box [4].

The petition is denied, and the preliminary injunction is dissolved [4].
