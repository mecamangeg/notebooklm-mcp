I. CAPTION
CARLOS B. SIY v. TAN GUN GA, ELISA SY, SANTIAGO SIY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19096, February 29, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Carlos B. Siy, the registered owner of a parcel of land in Manila covered by TCT No. 60008, filed a petition to direct the Register of Deeds to delete the names of oppositors Tan Gun Ga et al. (owners of the improvements on said land) from the face of the title [1]. Siy argued that listing them on the face was misleading and prayed that their ownership of the improvements be annotated instead at the back of the title [2].

The hearing was set for July 15, 1961. The oppositors failed to appear, and the lower court granted the petition on July 22, 1961 [2]. The oppositors filed a motion for reconsideration, alleging they received the notice of hearing only on July 14, 1961—one day before the hearing—and thus were denied the required three-day notice [2, 3]. The trial court denied the motion, prompting this appeal [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court erred in denying the motion for reconsideration despite the lack of three-day notice.
2. W/N the names of the owners of improvements should be recorded on the face of the certificate of title rather than at the back.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that since the oppositors received the copy of the notice of hearing only one day before said hearing, and there was no fact showing otherwise, they did not have the requisite three-day notice of the motion [4]. Consequently, the order granting the petition should have been reconsidered on this ground alone [5].

2. **YES.** (Technically the ruling affirms the face is the proper place, so the answer to "should be recorded on the face" is YES; or if the issue is "W/N the petition to move them to the back has merit", the answer is NO).

*Correction for clarity based on the specific framing "W/N the names... should be recorded on the face...":*
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the face of the certificate of title is the proper place to state the names of the owners of buildings or improvements, not the back [6]. The back of the title is expressly reserved for the "Memorandum of Encumbrances," such as mortgages or obligations for which the land is liable [6]. Under Civil Law, a building is real property itself, and if attached permanently to the land, it becomes part of the land; it is not an encumbrance [6].

Accordingly, the order appealed from is reversed and set aside, and the petition is denied [7].
