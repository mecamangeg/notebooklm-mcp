I. CAPTION
SIGBE LASUD, LUMAGUS MAMADUD and PRIMITIVA MAMADUD v. SANTAY LASUD and GUINANTANA CIA, G.R. No. L-19242, February 29, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
The subject property was originally a homestead covered by Original Certificate of Title No. 1232, issued pursuant to a Homestead Patent in 1934 to the father of plaintiff Sigbe Lasud and defendant Santay Lasud. Upon their father's death, Sigbe and Santay inherited the land as co-owners [1]. On July 14, 1955, Sigbe sold her interest and participation in the land to her brother Santay and his wife for P550.00. The original title was cancelled, and a new one was issued in Santay’s name [2].

On August 10, 1959, Sigbe filed an action to compel Santay to reconvey the share she sold, invoking her right to repurchase under Section 119 of the Public Land Act (Commonwealth Act No. 141). The lower court dismissed the action, ruling that the right to redeem under the Public Land Act applies only to sales made to third parties outside the family circle. Since Santay is the son of the homesteader, the sale did not take the land out of the family [3, 4]. Sigbe appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a daughter of a homesteader can redeem the portion of the homestead she sold to her brother (son of the same homesteader) under Section 119 of the Public Land Act.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. The Court held that the purpose of Section 119 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 is to preserve and keep the homestead within the family of the original homesteader [3]. In this case, the buyer (Santay) is the son of the original homesteader, an immediate member of the family, and a direct descendant/heir. He is as close to the original homesteader as the seller (Sigbe) [5]. Since the sale was made to a brother and co-heir, the land remained within the family circle. Therefore, the redemption sought does not fall within the purpose, spirit, or meaning of the Public Land Act [5, 6].

Order affirmed.
