**I. CAPTION**
CONNELL BROS. CO. (PHIL.) v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-15470, March 31, 1964, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
The Respondent Collector of Internal Revenue filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the Supreme Court's decision dated December 26, 1963. The Respondent sought to modify the judgment to declare Petitioner Connell Bros. Co. liable for a 25% surcharge for the late payment of deficiency sales taxes for the period from January 18, 1948, to January 31, 1949. The delay in payment was due to a controversy regarding the proper interpretation of the Respondent's own Circulars Nos. 431 and 440, specifically concerning whether the inclusion of the words "tax included" on invoices constituted sufficient compliance. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) itself had previously held the view that such practice was sufficient, evidenced by earlier BIR rulings.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Petitioner is liable for the 25% surcharge for late payment of deficiency sales tax under Section 183(a) of the National Internal Revenue Code.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that Section 183(a) of the National Internal Revenue Code is not applicable. This provision imposes a 25% penalty when percentage tax is not paid on time and contemplates cases where the tax liability is "undisputed or indisputable" [1]. In this case, the taxes were paid, and the delay pertained only to the deficiency resulting from a controversy generated in good faith regarding the interpretation of the BIR Circulars [1]. Since the Respondent's office had originally adopted the incorrect interpretation that "tax included" was sufficient compliance, it would be unjust to penalize the Petitioner for falling into the same error [2]. The Court distinguished this from cases cited by the Respondent, noting that in those instances, the tax liability was not disputed, whereas here, the question was whether the deficiency sales tax was due at all [2].

The Motion for Reconsideration is denied [3].
