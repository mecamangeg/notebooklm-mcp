I. CAPTION
JOSE V. RODRIGUEZ, ET AL. v. IGNACIO SANTOS DIAZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19553, February 29, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On January 30, 1962, the President issued Administrative Order No. 4 ordering an immediate investigation of the National Rice and Corn Corporation (NARIC) to determine the causes of its failure to attain its objectives [1, 2]. Pending investigation, petitioner Jose V. Rodriguez, Chairman of the Board, and other members were suspended [1]. Respondent Ignacio Santos Diaz was appointed as presidential investigator [1]. On February 10, 1962, additional administrative charges were filed against Rodriguez in his capacity as *Acting* General Manager [3].

Rodriguez questioned the jurisdiction of the investigator regarding his capacity as Acting General Manager, arguing that under Republic Act No. 663, the power to appoint and discipline the General Manager belongs to the Board of Directors, not the President [3, 4]. The investigator overruled the objection [3]. Petitioners filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of First Instance of Manila, which was dismissed [5, 6]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the President has the authority to appoint an investigator to inquire into the actuations of the Acting General Manager of a government corporation even if the power to discipline him resides with the Board of Directors.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the President may authorize the appointment of an investigator for the Acting General Manager even if under the law the authority to appoint and discipline him belongs to the Board of Directors [7, 8].

The Court reasoned that the investigation was not punitive in nature but merely an inquiry into matters which the President is entitled to know for his guidance in the enforcement of laws [7, 8]. Rodriguez had already been relieved as General Manager by the Board on January 25, 1962, prior to the investigation of the specific charges [8, 9]. Therefore, the purpose was not to remove him but to gather facts to aid the President in determining why NARIC failed to attain its objectives, particularly regarding price stabilization [8].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [10].
