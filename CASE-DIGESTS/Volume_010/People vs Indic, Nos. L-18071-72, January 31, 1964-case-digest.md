I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BONIFACIO INDIC and ANTONIO CABIAS**, G.R. Nos. L-18071-72, January 31, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of September 28, 1958, in Dulag, Leyte, accused Bonifacio Indic, Antonio Cabias, and Tansing Estaco went to the house of Cosmiana Camadoc to challenge her brother, Alberto, to a fight. Bernardo Camadoc, who was in a house across the street, shouted to Alberto not to go down. Irked by the interference, Indic went up and hacked Bernardo with a bolo. Bernardo jumped out of the window to escape, but Indic, Cabias, and Estaco chased him. When they overtook him, all three thrust their bolos at him, inflicting multiple wounds which caused his death on October 1, 1958 [1], [2], [3].

The Court of First Instance of Leyte convicted Indic and Cabias of Murder and Direct Assault. Both appealed, but Indic withdrew his appeal. Consequently, the Supreme Court reviewed only the appeal of Cabias regarding the Murder conviction [4], [5]. Cabias denied participation, claiming he only witnessed the incident and pleaded for the victim, but eyewitnesses positively identified him as one of the attackers [6], [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N conspiracy existed among the accused.
2. W/N the crime committed was Murder.
3. W/N the mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction should be appreciated.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Conspiracy was established by the appellant's direct and active participation in the assault. Cabias chased and stabbed the deceased simultaneously with his co-accused. The presence of multiple stab wounds inflicted by the three accused revealed a concerted attack with unity of action and a joint purpose. Conspiracy arises the very instant the plotters agree, expressly or impliedly, to commit the felony and decide to pursue it [8], [9].

2. **NO.** Cabias is guilty only of **Homicide**. The qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation was not proven because the accused originally intended to fight Alberto, turning on Bernardo only when he intervened; thus, they did not cling to a reflective intention to kill Bernardo. While abuse of superior strength was proven, it was not alleged in the information and can only be considered a generic aggravating circumstance. Treachery was also absent as the attack was impulsive and not consciously adopted to insure execution without risk [10], [11].

3. **YES.** The Court upheld the trial court's appreciation of the mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction. It is the province of the trial court to determine the existence of this circumstance, based not merely on illiteracy but on the lack of sufficient intelligence and knowledge of the full significance of one's acts [12], [13], [11].

**Decision affirmed with modification.** Appellant Cabias is found guilty of Homicide [14], [15].
