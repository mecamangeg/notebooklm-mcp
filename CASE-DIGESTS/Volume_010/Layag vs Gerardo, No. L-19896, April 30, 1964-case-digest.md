I. CAPTION
REMEDIOS LAYAG, ET AL. v. JUAN GERARDO, G.R. No. L-19896, April 30, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Remedios Layag filed a claim for disability benefits against the Republic (Bureau of Public Works) for the death of her husband, which was granted by Respondent Hearing Officer Juan Gerardo in the amount of P4,000.00 [1, 2]. The Republic filed a Motion for Extension to file a Motion for Reconsideration, which Gerardo granted [2, 3]. Layag moved to vacate the extension order, arguing it was defective, but Gerardo denied her motion and elevated the records to the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) [3, 4]. Layag then filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, alleging that Gerardo acted with grave abuse of discretion [5]. The CFI dismissed the petition on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter, as the WCC has exclusive jurisdiction [6, 7]. Layag appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to review the orders of a Regional Hearing Officer via certiorari.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the CFI has no jurisdiction to review the orders of the Regional Hearing Officer. Under Section 46 of Act 3428 (Workmen's Compensation Act) and Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) exercises exclusive appellate jurisdiction over claims decided by Regional Offices [9, 10]. The proper remedy was an appeal to the WCC and finally to the Supreme Court, not a petition for certiorari in the CFI [10].

Furthermore, certiorari does not lie because the order granting an extension is interlocutory and within the discretion of the hearing officer [11]. Even if the officer committed an error, it would constitute a mistake of law or fact, not a grave abuse of discretion correctible by certiorari [11]. The Court cited *Villa-Rey Transit, Inc. v. E. Bello* to emphasize that erroneous orders within a body's jurisdiction must be corrected by appeal, not certiorari [11].
