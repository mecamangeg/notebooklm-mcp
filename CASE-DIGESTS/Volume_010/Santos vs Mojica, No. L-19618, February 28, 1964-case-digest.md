**I. CAPTION**
LEONARDO SANTOS, ET AL. v. HON. ANGEL H. MOJICA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19618, February 28, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Heirs of Apolonio Allanigue filed a complaint for partition against Lorenza Allanigue and occupants Maria and Felicidad San Agustin [1]. The trial court ordered the property partitioned among the twelve heirs and the second wife [1]. Lorenza was awarded a 30 sq.m. portion, but it was ordered set off against P990.00 in rentals she was sentenced to pay [2].

When Lorenza failed to pay, the court issued a writ of execution [2]. As the sheriff attempted to eject the occupants, Petitioner Leonardo Santos (Lorenza's son) filed a third-party claim, alleging he owned the property involved [3], [4]. The plaintiffs posted an indemnity bond, and Santos filed a motion to recall the writ, which the court denied [3]. The court subsequently ordered the demolition of the houses on the land [5]. Santos, joined by Lorenza and the other occupants, filed a petition for certiorari alleging grave abuse of discretion [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a petition for certiorari is the proper remedy for a third-party claimant to stop the execution of a final judgment in a partition case.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court ruled that certiorari is not the proper remedy because there were other adequate remedies available [6], [7].

For petitioners Lorenza Allanigue, Maria, and Felicidad San Agustin, the lower court's decision in the partition case had already become final due to their failure to appeal. Therefore, they could not allege grave abuse of discretion regarding the enforcement of a final decision [1].

For petitioner Leonardo Santos, although he was not a party to the partition case, his procedure was incorrect [4]. To vindicate his alleged ownership, the proper remedy sanctioned by law was not to file a motion in the partition case or a petition for certiorari, but to file a "separate and independent action" against the sheriff and the plaintiffs [8], [4].

Petition is denied [9].
