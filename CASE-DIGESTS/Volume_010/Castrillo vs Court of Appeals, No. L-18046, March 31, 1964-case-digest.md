I. CAPTION
PAULINO M. CASTRILLO and FELICISIMA CASTRILLO v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, DOROTEO DIMARANAN and DOLORES MASIPAG DIMARANAN, G.R. No. L-18046, March 31, 1964, 10 SCRA 549, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Lot No. 188 was registered in the name of Crispina Miranda. In 1929, she executed an affidavit acknowledging that the lot belonged in common to her and her sisters, Telesfora and Isabel. In 1932, Isabel sold her 1/3 share to respondent Doroteo Dimaranan, who then entered into possession. In 1934, Crispina executed a document confirming the sale of portions of the lot to Isabel. Crispina died in 1935, but the title remained in her name (and later her heirs).

In 1955, petitioners Paulino and Felicisima Castrillo (heirs of Crispina) executed a deed of partition covering the remaining area registered in Crispina's name, cancelling the old title and securing a new one exclusively in their names. In 1956, respondents filed an action to be declared owners of the 1/3 share and for reconveyance. Petitioners argued the action was barred by prescription, claiming the period started running from the execution of the documents in 1924, 1932, or 1934. The Court of Appeals ruled in favor of respondents, applying Article 1434 of the Civil Code on estoppel.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the principle of estoppel applies even if the transaction occurred before the New Civil Code.
2. W/N the respondents' action for reconveyance is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The principle of estoppel, while expressed in statutory form for the first time in the New Civil Code (Article 1434), is not an innovation. It is based on equity, moral right, and natural justice, and had been applied in Philippine jurisprudence as early as 1908 in *Llacer v. Muñoz* [12 Phil. 328]. Furthermore, only the party against whom estoppel is invoked (the vendor Isabel) may challenge it; the petitioners, being successors of Crispina who conveyed rights to Isabel, cannot raise this defense to deny the rights Isabel acquired.

2. **NO.** Co-ownership is a form of trust, and every co-owner is a trustee for the others. Possession by one trustee is not deemed adverse to the rest. The petitioners, as heirs, merely succeeded to the co-ownership and held the property in a fiduciary capacity. The statute of limitations only started to run in 1955 when petitioners executed the deed of partition and obtained a new title in their names, which constituted an express repudiation of the co-ownership and a denial of respondents' share. Since the action was filed in 1956, it was not barred by prescription.

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
