I. CAPTION
IN RE: PETITION FOR CONSOLIDATION OF OWNERSHIP OF REAL PROPERTY, ANGEL FUNIESTAS v. SEVERO ARCE, G.R. No. L-15891, February 29, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On July 10, 1948, Severo Arce executed a "Deed of Sale with the Right to Repurchase" over a parcel of riceland in Zambales in favor of Angel Funiestas for P2,750.00, with a ten-year redemption period [1]. After Arce allegedly failed to redeem the property, Funiestas filed a petition for consolidation of ownership on December 10, 1958, with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zambales [2]. Arce opposed the petition, alleging that the price was inadequate and that there was a verbal agreement requiring Funiestas to make a demand one year prior to the expiration of the redemption period, which was not done [2]. The CFI initially referred the case to the Clerk of Court for the presentation of evidence due to questions of fact arising from the pleadings [3]. However, without any evidence being presented, the CFI later issued an order stating the resolution was merely a question of law and subsequently declared Funiestas' ownership consolidated [3]. Arce appealed directly to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court erred in resolving the petition for consolidation without receiving evidence on the factual issues raised.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the lower court's finding that the case involved only a question of law is not supported by the record [4]. The pleadings raised specific questions of fact, particularly regarding the nature of the contract and the alleged verbal agreement between the parties [2, 4]. The Court held that the basic petition should not have been resolved without the parties submitting their respective evidence on the questions of fact involved [5].

The Order appealed from is set aside, and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [6].
