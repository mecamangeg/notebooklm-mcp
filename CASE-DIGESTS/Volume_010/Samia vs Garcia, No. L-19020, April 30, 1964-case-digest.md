I. CAPTION
ANTONIO M. SAMIA v. HON. GREGORIO N. GARCIA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19020, April 30, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On February 18, 1959, Antonio M. Samia filed an action for ejectment and recovery of back rentals in the Municipal Court of Manila against Tiburcio Alvarez and others [1]. The defendants moved to suspend the trial invoking Republic Act No. 1162, claiming the land was subject to expropriation proceedings [1]. The Municipal Court granted the suspension [1]. Samia filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, which granted the petition and ordered the ejectment case to proceed [2, 3]. However, on appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the CFI decision [3]. Samia then filed this petition for review [1]. During the pendency of this case, the Supreme Court promulgated a decision in *Republic vs. Samia* (G.R. No. L-17569) on May 31, 1963, dismissing the expropriation proceedings involving the subject land [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the suspension of the ejectment proceedings should be lifted.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the order suspending the ejectment case was solely predicated on the filing of the condemnation proceedings (Civil Case No. 33156) covering the subject land [4]. Since the Supreme Court had already rendered a final decision in G.R. No. L-17569 affirming the dismissal of the expropriation proceedings on the ground that the property could not be subject to expropriation, the basis for the order of suspension no longer exists [4]. Consequently, the trial of the ejectment case must be allowed to proceed [4].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED to the Municipal Court of Manila for the continuation of the ejectment case [5].
