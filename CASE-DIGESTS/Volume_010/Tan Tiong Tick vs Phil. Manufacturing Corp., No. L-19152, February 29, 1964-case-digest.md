I. CAPTION
TAN TIONG TICK v. PHILIPPINE MANUFACTURING CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-19152, February 29, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
In 1951, respondent Philippine Manufacturing Corp. (PMC), through its vice-president Ernesto Tan-Chi, sought to import textiles through one Lucilo Macaraig. Because PMC did not know Macaraig well enough to entrust him with P20,000.00 cash for the importation, PMC issued a check for said amount payable to petitioner Tan Tiong Tick, a friend of Tan-Chi. The agreement was that Tan Tiong Tick would assume responsibility for the advance, and profits from the transaction would be shared equally between him and PMC. Tan Tiong Tick indorsed and encashed the check, turning the proceeds over to Macaraig. Macaraig failed to deliver the goods. In 1958, PMC sued Tan Tiong Tick for the collection of the amount. Tan Tiong Tick denied liability, claiming he only signed as a witness to the encashment. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of PMC, finding the petitioner's defense implausible for an experienced businessman.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Tan Tiong Tick is liable for the amount advanced despite the absence of a written agreement.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. The Court ruled that the absence of a written agreement regarding the P20,000.00 does not militate against the conclusion that the petitioner promised to respond for the amount. Such promise was sufficiently proven by the testimony of PMC's vice-president and supported by the circumstances, specifically that the check was made payable to and indorsed by the petitioner. The Court rejected the defense that he was merely a witness, noting that an experienced businessman would not sign as payee and indorser if he did not intend to be liable. Furthermore, the seven-year lapse before the suit was filed created no presumption against the existence of the obligation, as the account was carried in PMC's books and yearly confirmation notices were sent to the petitioner.

Appeal dismissed; decision affirmed.
