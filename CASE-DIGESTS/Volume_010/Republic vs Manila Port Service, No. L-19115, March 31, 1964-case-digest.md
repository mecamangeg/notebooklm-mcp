**I. CAPTION**
**REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MANILA PORT SERVICE**, G.R. No. L-19115, March 31, 1964, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
On May 9, 1957, two cases containing a paper-cutter table arrived in Manila aboard the *SS Pioneer Mist* and were received by the defendant Manila Port Service (MPS). The shipment was consigned to the Bureau of Agricultural Extension [1]. The "Permit to Deliver Imported Goods" was issued to the broker only on June 28, 1957, about 50 days after the vessel's arrival [2]. On July 22, 1957, MPS released only one case to the consignee; the other was missing [3].

MPS issued a shortlanded certificate on August 20, 1957, admitting the shortage [3]. Subsequently, on August 29, 1957, and March 12, 1959, MPS wrote letters to the consignee claiming they had found the missing case stored in Pier 7, though the consignee's representatives failed to locate it upon inspection [4, 5]. Finally, on September 30, 1959, MPS rejected the claim, alleging the shortlanded certificate was an error and the claim was barred because it was not filed within the 15-day period from the discharge of the last package, as stipulated in Section 15 of the Management Contract [6, 7].

The Republic filed a suit for the value of the missing merchandise (P7,979.00) [8]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the Republic but limited liability to P500.00 [9]. MPS appealed, insisting the action was barred by prescription [9].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the plaintiff's claim is barred by prescription for failure to file within the 15-day period stipulated in the Management Contract.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The defense of prescription is untenable. First, the 15-day period cannot apply strictly where the "Permit to Deliver" was issued 50 days after arrival and the goods were actually delivered to the consignee two and a half months after the vessel's arrival. It was impossible for the consignee to file a claim within 15 days of the cargo's discharge when it only obtained possession of the shipment months later [2].

Second, MPS is **estopped** from invoking the 15-day limitation. MPS issued a shortlanded certificate and subsequent letters (as late as March 12, 1959) admitting the existence and shortage of the cargo [10, 11]. The Supreme Court held, citing *Consunji v. Manila Port Service*, that the purpose of the 15-day requirement—to afford the operator a reasonable opportunity to check the validity of claims while facts are fresh—had already been served by these admissions [10]. It would be unfair to release MPS from liability on a technicality after it had entertained the claim for almost two years [11].

**Decision affirmed.**
