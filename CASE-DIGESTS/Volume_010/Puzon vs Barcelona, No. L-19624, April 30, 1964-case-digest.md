I. CAPTION
BARTOLOME PUZON v. HON. MANUEL P. BARCELONA and WILLIAM UY, G.R. No. L-19624, April 30, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Bartolome Puzon, a public works contractor, formed a partnership called "UP Construction Company" with respondent William Uy in 1956 to sub-contract government projects Puzon had secured from the Bureau of Public Highways (BPH) [1]. Uy later sued Puzon for failing to comply with partnership obligations. The lower court (Judge Barcelona) ruled in Uy's favor, dissolving the partnership and ordering Puzon to pay Uy over P300,000 in capital, unrealized profits, and fees [2].

Pending Puzon’s appeal, Uy moved for immediate execution. Judge Barcelona granted the motion, issuing execution against Puzon's 10% retention fund (P145,358.00) held by the BPH [1, 2]. The judge cited Uy's long deprivation of his investment and profits as a "special reason" for execution pending appeal [3]. The Solicitor General intervened on behalf of the BPH, arguing that the 10% retention fund is reserved by law to answer for the contractor's liabilities to the government (taxes, repairs, etc.) and cannot be garnished. The trial court overruled the intervention, stating the BPH was protected by Puzon's performance bond [3, 4]. Puzon filed a petition for certiorari to reverse the special order [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the deprivation of a partner's investment and profits constitutes a "special reason" for immediate execution pending appeal.
2. W/N a judgment can be executed against the 10% retention fund in the possession of the Bureau of Public Highways.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the right of a partner to a judgment against his copartner is merely a contractual right dependent on the success of the partnership's subcontracts. Uy is considered "less than an ordinary creditor" because his recovery depends on the existence of profits [6]. Consequently, the mere deprivation of investment and profits does not constitute a "special reason" sufficient to justify immediate execution of judgment under the Rules of Court [6, 7].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the right to immediate execution cannot be enforced against the 10% retention fund held by the BPH [7]. The government's right to retain this fund to cover services rendered and materials furnished by third persons is a legal lien established in the original construction contract and recognized by law [7]. This lien prevails over the execution of judgment for a private party.

**The petition is GRANTED, and the writ of preliminary injunction is made permanent.** [8]
