I. CAPTION
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and LUZ AGUIRRE, G.R. No. L-19863, April 29, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Luz Aguirre was employed by petitioner National Development Company (NDC) as a weaver. Her work involved heavy lifting and frequent night shifts [1]. In April 1953, she suffered chest pains and spat blood while working, was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, and was subsequently separated from service on June 30, 1953 [1]. NDC failed to report her condition and dismissal to the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) as required by law [2]. Aguirre filed a compensation claim on June 6, 1960, seven years later [3]. The WCC awarded her compensation and attorney's fees equivalent to 7.5% of the award [3]. NDC appealed, arguing that the claim was barred by the delay in filing and that the attorney's fees violated the 5% limit under Section 31 of the Workmen's Compensation Law [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N NDC is barred from controverting the claim despite the employee's delay in filing.
2. W/N the WCC may award attorney's fees against the employer in excess of the rates fixed by Section 31 of the Workmen's Compensation Law.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The employer’s failure to report the employee’s condition leading to dismissal, within the period prescribed by Section 45 of the Workmen's Compensation Law, imports a renunciation (or forfeiture) of the right to controvert the claim [2]. This statutory bar excludes all defenses available to the employer, making no exception, including the defense based on the employee's failure to file the claim in due time [4]. This forfeiture is imposed regardless of the employer's actual intent and is not subject to the limitations of a voluntary waiver [4].

2. **YES.** Section 31 of the Workmen's Compensation Law governs the fees paid by the *laborer* to their lawyer, but it does not govern fees recoverable from the *adverse party* [6]. The deficiency in the special law is supplemented by Article 18 and Article 2208(8) of the Civil Code, which allow for the recovery of attorney's fees [7]. The legislative intent is that the compensation received by the injured workman should not be diminished by lawyer's fees; thus, reasonable fees may be awarded against the employer even if they exceed the percentage fixed by Section 31 [6, 8].

Decision affirmed [9].
