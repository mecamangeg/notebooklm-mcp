I. CAPTION
EMILIANO DALANDAN and MARIA DALANDAN, assisted by her husband JULIAN SILVERIO v. VICTORIA JULIO, ELEUTERIO SANTOS, and FRANCISCA ECHIPARI, G.R. No. L-19101, February 29, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On September 24, 1932, Clemente Dalandan sold 50 salt beds in Las Piñas to Victorina Dalandan for P4,000.00 by way of *pacto de retro* sale, stipulating a ten-year redemption period [1]. On May 14, 1940, prior to the expiration of said period, the parties executed another document whereby Victorina waived the ten-year period and granted Clemente the right to redeem the property "at any time," without limitation [2].

In December 1960, plaintiffs (Clemente's successors) offered to redeem the property, but defendants (Victorina's successors) refused [3]. Plaintiffs consigned the P4,000.00 in court and filed a complaint to extinguish the alleged "equitable mortgage" [4, 5]. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the cause of action was barred because the waiver of the period was void and title had already consolidated [6]. The trial court dismissed the complaint, holding that the "at any time" stipulation violated Article 1508 of the old Civil Code and that plaintiffs lost their right to redeem after the original ten-year period [7-9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the stipulation waiving the ten-year period and granting the right to repurchase "at any time" is valid.
2. W/N the 1940 agreement constitutes a separate promise to sell.
3. W/N the contract should be treated as an equitable mortgage.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The stipulation is void. Under Article 1508 of the old Civil Code, the period for a *pacto de retro* sale cannot exceed ten years [10]. A stipulation granting the right to repurchase "at any time" violates this provision and is illicit [11]. Consequently, the vendor *a retro* should have exercised the right within the original ten-year period ending September 24, 1942. Having failed to do so, title consolidated *ipso facto* in the vendee [11].

2. **NO.** The 1940 waiver did not amount to a new "promise to sell" for an indefinite period. An agreement to repurchase becomes a promise to sell only when made *after* title has consolidated in the vendee, creating a new independent contract [12]. Here, the agreement was made *before* the expiration of the original period; it merely modified the exercise of the existing right of repurchase, which remained subject to the statutory ten-year limit [12].

3. **NO.** The complaint's description of the contract as an "equitable mortgage" is a mere conclusion of law, which is not deemed admitted by a motion to dismiss [13]. Furthermore, the transaction occurred under the old Civil Code, where the payment of taxes (alleged by plaintiffs) was not a ground to presume an equitable mortgage; the presumption under Article 1602 of the New Civil Code does not apply retroactively [14, 15]. Finally, the vendee's right to enjoy the products of the land is an element of ownership and is not incompatible with a sale *a retro* [16].

The Order of the trial court dismissing the complaint is **AFFIRMED** [17].
