I. CAPTION
IN RE SEARCH WARRANT SEIZURE OF SLOT MACHINES WITH OTHER PARAPHERNALIA IN PASAY CITY; SIXTO MAGDALUYO, CARLOS MAGDALUYO and RODOLFO TAYLAN v. THE ACTING DIRECTOR, NATIONAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, G.R. No. L-18899, March 31, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On June 3, 1959, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) seized slot machines belonging to Magdaluyo, et al. in Pasay City under a search warrant. The special prosecutor of the Department of Justice declined to file any criminal information against the owners, finding they committed no offense, and the Secretary of Justice ordered the return of the machines [1, 2]. The NBI Acting Director opposed the return, arguing that under *Uy Ha v. City of Manila*, slot machines are gambling devices illegal *per se* and subject to forfeiture [3]. Five years lapsed without any criminal action instituted against the owners [2]. The Supreme Court previously ordered the return of the machines, prompting the NBI to file this Motion for Reconsideration [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the slot machines are illegal *per se* and subject to forfeiture despite the absence of a criminal conviction establishing their illegal use.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that slot machines are not illegal *per se* because they may be used for innocent purposes; their character is determined by the use to which they are put [5]. Unlike in *Uy Ha v. City of Manila* where a local ordinance expressly prohibited slot machines, the ordinance in Pasay City expressly authorized their operation [6, 7].

Furthermore, articles that may be used for legal purposes cannot be seized or forfeited until it has first been established in a court of criminal jurisdiction that they were procured, held, or used for an illegal purpose [8]. Since the prosecutor found no criminal offense and no criminal proceeding was instituted, there is no basis for forfeiture. Citing *Woods v. Cottrell*, the Court emphasized that if the accused is not guilty, the machine cannot be destroyed; restitution must follow [9].

The Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED** [10].
