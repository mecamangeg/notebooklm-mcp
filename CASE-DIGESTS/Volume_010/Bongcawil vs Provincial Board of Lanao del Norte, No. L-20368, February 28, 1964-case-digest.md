I. CAPTION
CRISPIN BONGCAWIL v. THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF LANAO DEL NORTE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20368, February 28, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On March 7, 1960, a complaint was filed against petitioner Crispin Bongcawil, the Mayor of Maigo, Lanao del Norte, for alleged irregularities [1]. After the petitioner filed his answer and hearings were conducted, individual members of the Provincial Board prepared draft opinions—two for exoneration and one for conviction [1]. However, before a formal resolution could be passed, two board members vacated their seats to run for Congress [2]. On September 7, 1962, the newly constituted Board convened and unanimously passed a resolution adopting the draft decision prepared by the former Vice-Governor, which found petitioner guilty and recommended his dismissal [1, 2]. Instead of appealing this decision to the Executive, petitioner filed a petition for certiorari directly with the Supreme Court, arguing that the new decision was void and that the previous draft opinions for exoneration should be binding [1, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the individual draft opinions of the former Board members constituted a binding decision.
2. W/N the petition for certiorari is proper despite the failure to appeal to the Office of the President.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the individual opinions were merely drafts that had not been finally acted upon by the Board [4]. A provincial board is a deliberative body, and only a formal resolution adopted by the board can be considered a decision in an administrative case [4, 5]. The only formal resolution regarding the case was the one dated September 7, 1962, which validly adopted the decision for dismissal [4].

2. **NO.** The petition cannot be sustained because the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies [3]. Under Section 2190 of the Revised Administrative Code, the proper remedy against a decision of the Provincial Board is an appeal to the Office of the President [3, 6]. Since the petitioner failed to pursue this appeal, he cannot avail of the special civil action of certiorari [3].

Petition denied [7].
