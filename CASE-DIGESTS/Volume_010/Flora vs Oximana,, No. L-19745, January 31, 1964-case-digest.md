I. CAPTION
ELISEO FLORA, ET AL. v. VICENTE OXIMANA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19745, January 31, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Vicente Oximana was convicted of the crime of *abusos deshonestos* in 1926 and served his sentence until 1930 [1, 2]. In 1948, he became the president of the Benguet-Balatoc Workers Union (BBWU) and was continuously re-elected to the position [3]. On February 2, 1961, a complaint was filed with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) seeking to disqualify Oximana from the presidency pursuant to Section 17(e) of Republic Act 875, which disqualifies individuals convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude from holding union office [2]. During the pendency of the case, on April 1, 1961, the President of the Philippines granted Oximana a full and absolute pardon, restoring his civil and political rights [4]. The CIR dismissed the complaint, ruling that the pardon removed the disqualification, a decision affirmed by the CIR *en banc* [4, 5]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the absolute pardon granted to the respondent removes his disqualification from holding union office under Section 17(e) of Republic Act 875.

IV. RULING
**YES.** An absolute pardon restores a person to his full civil and political rights, one of which is the right to hold any office in a legitimate labor organization [1, 6].

The Court acknowledged that Oximana's 1926 conviction involved moral turpitude, which would ordinarily disqualify him under Section 17(e) of Republic Act 875 [7]. However, the absolute pardon granted in 1961 obliterated the legal consequences of the conviction. Citing *Pelobello v. Palatino* (72 Phil. 441) and *Cristobal v. Labrador* (71 Phil. 34), the Court ruled that an absolute pardon granted after the term of imprisonment has expired "removes all that is left of the consequences of the conviction" and restores the individual to the status of a "new man" [8, 9]. Consequently, the pardon removed the statutory disqualification.

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [10].
