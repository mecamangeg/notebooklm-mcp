**I. CAPTION**
FAUSTINO CUNETA v. MANUEL CASTAÑEDA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20025, January 31, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
The government purchased the Baclaran Estate for resale to bona fide tenants [1]. The Rural Progress Administration (RPA) awarded Lot 8 to respondent Juan O. De Leon in 1948, while Lot 7 was awarded to petitioner Faustino Cuneta [1, 2]. Years later, in 1955, Cuneta refused to vacate Lot 8 and filed a complaint with the RPA claiming he was the bona fide tenant entitled to preference [2]. The Land Tenure Administration (LTA), which succeeded the RPA, dismissed Cuneta's complaint and ordered the execution of the deed of sale to De Leon [2]. Cuneta’s motion for reconsideration was denied on May 4, 1957 [3].

Under the LTA's Administrative Order No. 1, decisions must be appealed to the Office of the President within 30 days [4]. Instead of appealing, Cuneta filed a complaint with the PCAC and subsequently filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal on February 26, 1959 [2]. The CFI dismissed the petition on the ground that the LTA decision had already become final and executory due to Cuneta’s failure to exhaust administrative remedies [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner is barred from filing a judicial action due to his failure to appeal the decision of the Land Tenure Administration to the Office of the President.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Land Tenure Administration (LTA) is an office created by law with a personality separate from the government [6]. Under Section 6 of Republic Act 1400, it possesses quasi-judicial powers to promulgate rules and decide conflicting claims regarding lot apportionment; its decisions and rules have the force and effect of law [6, 7].

LTA Administrative Order No. 1 expressly requires that appeals be made to the Office of the President within 30 days [4]. Petitioner received the denial of his motion for reconsideration on June 13, 1957, but only filed the judicial action in 1959 [3]. His failure to appeal on time rendered the LTA decision final and bars the judicial action under the principle of *res judicata* [7]. Furthermore, certiorari requires that there be no other adequate remedy; here, the petitioner had the remedy of administrative appeal but failed to utilize it [7].

**Decision affirmed.**
