I. CAPTION
THE CITY OF MANILA v. VENANCIO BACAY and FELICIANO BACAY, G.R. Nos. L-19358-59, March 31, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
The City of Manila filed separate complaints for ejectment against Venancio Bacay and Feliciano Bacay in the municipal court, alleging failure to pay monthly rentals and failure to vacate despite demands [1]. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila rendered judgment ordering the defendants to vacate the premises [2, 3].

On appeal, the defendants argued that the complaints failed to allege that the City needed the premises for its own use, which was the actual ground relied upon since the City admitted during trial that the defendants were up-to-date on their rental payments [3, 4]. The defendants contended that because the only ground alleged in the complaint (non-payment) was disproven, the action should fail, and evidence regarding the City's need for the property should not have been admitted [3, 4]. However, during the trial, the City presented demand letters (Exhibit "A") stating that the lots were urgently needed for the Streets and Bridges Division, which were admitted without objection from the defendants [4-6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the failure to allege the City's need for the premises in the complaint was cured by the admission of evidence without objection.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the admission of the demand letters (Exhibit "A") without objection by the defendants *ipso facto* cured the defective allegations in the complaints [6]. Although the initial complaints relied solely on non-payment of rentals—a ground disproved at trial—the admitted letters supplied the necessary allegation that the City needed the lots for its own use and had demanded the defendants to vacate [4, 6]. Consequently, the complaints were deemed amended to include these allegations [6]. The Court affirmed the judgment of the lower court [7].
