I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE COAL MINER'S UNION v. CEBU PORTLAND CEMENT CO., HON. ARSENIO I. MARTINEZ, EMILIANO C. TABIGNE and AMADO C. BUGAYONG, G.R. No. L-19007, April 30, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
In 1948, the Philippine Land-Air-Sea Labor Union (PLASLU) filed Case No. 241-V against respondent Cebu Portland Cement Co. (CEPOC), resulting in a 1951 judgment granting benefits to employees. Years later, PLASLU sought to extend these awards to CEPOC's provincial branches, including Malangas. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) issued an order on November 3, 1959, directing the examination of records to compute potential awards for these branches.

Meanwhile, on February 9, 1959, petitioner Philippine Coal Miner's Union (PCMU), a separate union representing employees of the Malangas Coal Mines, filed Case No. 6-V-Davao against CEPOC. PCMU demanded overtime pay for Sundays and holidays from 1951 and benefits under Republic Act No. 1880. CEPOC answered without specifically pleading *res judicata*, merely alleging that petitioners were not entitled to relief.

The CIR Trial Judge ruled in favor of PCMU, awarding P112,762.30 for overtime services from 1951 to 1955. However, the CIR *en banc*, acting on CEPOC's motion for reconsideration, set aside this specific award. The *en banc* resolution held that the claim was barred by *res judicata* due to the proceedings in the earlier PLASLU case (Case No. 241-V). PCMU filed a petition for certiorari.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of *res judicata* was waived by CEPOC.
2. W/N the present action is barred by *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The defense of *res judicata* is deemed waived if not specifically pleaded in the motion to dismiss or answer. CEPOC's general allegation that "petitioner is not entitled to the relief prayed for" is vague and fails to meet the requirement under Section 9, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court that grounds raising issues of fact must be specifically pleaded.

2. **NO.** The elements of *res judicata* are not present. First, there was no prior final judgment; the CIR order in Case No. 241-V was merely interlocutory as it required further computations and reports for final adjudication. Second, there is no identity of parties, subject matter, or cause of action. Case No. 241-V involved PLASLU and general labor demands, while the present case involves PCMU (a distinct union with different members) and specific statutory claims for overtime pay. Consequently, the proceedings in the PLASLU case cannot bar PCMU's independent action.

**Petition is GRANTED.** The CIR *en banc* resolution is REVERSED, and the Trial Judge's award of P112,762.30 is reinstated.
