I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RITA LIM DE YU, G.R. No. L-17438, April 30, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Rita Lim de Yu (appellee) filed her income tax returns for the years 1948 to 1953 and paid the assessed taxes. On July 17, 1956, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) issued deficiency income tax assessments for 1945-1953. Appellee protested and requested a reinvestigation. On August 30, 1956, she executed a "waiver" of the statute of limitations to allow for the reinvestigation. Subsequently, on July 18, 1958, the BIR issued new deficiency assessment notices for 1948-1953 totaling P35,379.63, plus a 50% surcharge, alleging the returns were fraudulent. Upon appellee's failure to pay, the Republic filed a collection suit on May 11, 1959. The Court of First Instance dismissed the case, ruling that the government's right to collect had prescribed. The Republic appealed, arguing that the returns were fraudulent (warranting a 10-year prescriptive period) and that the waiver extended the period for assessment and collection.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the tax returns were false or fraudulent, justifying the application of the 10-year prescriptive period.
2. W/N the right to assess and collect taxes for the years 1948 to 1950 had prescribed.
3. W/N the right to collect taxes for the years 1951 to 1953 had prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Fraud was alleged but not proven. The Court held that for the 10-year limitation period under Section 332(a) of the Tax Code to apply, fraud must be established, not just alleged. The mere fact that the BIR calculated a higher income than what was declared does not constitute fraud. The BIR's own inconsistent computations on three different occasions indicated uncertainty regarding the appellee's true income rather than deliberate fraud by the taxpayer [1]. Consequently, the regular 5-year prescriptive period under Section 331 applied [2].

2. **YES.** Under Section 331, taxes must be assessed within five years after the return is filed. Since no fraud was proven, the right to assess taxes for 1948, 1949, and 1950 had already prescribed when the first deficiency assessment was issued on July 17, 1956. The waiver signed on August 30, 1956, could not validate these assessments because, under Section 332(b) of the Tax Code, an agreement to extend the period must be made *before* the expiration of the original period. A waiver cannot revive a right that has already prescribed [2].

3. **NO.** The waiver was valid for the years 1951 and 1952, as the 5-year period had not yet elapsed when the waiver was executed. For the year 1953, the assessment on July 18, 1958, was within the original 5-year period (return filed March 1, 1954), making the waiver unnecessary [3]. Regarding collection, Section 332(c) allows collection within five years *after* assessment. Since the assessment was validly made on July 18, 1958, the government had five years from that date to file suit. The Court rejected the argument that the waiver limited collection to December 31, 1958, ruling that the waiver extends the *assessment* period; once assessed, the statutory period for collection applies. The suit filed on May 11, 1959, was therefore timely [4].

**Disposition:** The appealed decision is MODIFIED. Appellee is ordered to pay the Republic the sum of P26,182.00 as deficiency income taxes for the years 1951, 1952, and 1953, plus 5% surcharge and 1% monthly interest thereon from July 31, 1958, until full payment [5].
