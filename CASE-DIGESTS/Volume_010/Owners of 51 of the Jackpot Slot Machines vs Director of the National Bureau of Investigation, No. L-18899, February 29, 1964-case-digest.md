I. CAPTION
**OWNERS OF 51 OF THE JACKPOT SLOT MACHINES v. THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION**, G.R. No. L-18899, February 29, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, owners of 51 jackpot slot machines, operated their units in Pasay City under licenses issued in conformity with Municipal Ordinance No. 106 [1]. On September 1, 1959, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) seized these machines pursuant to search warrants issued by the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal [1]. Although the special prosecutor recommended against filing criminal charges for these specific machines and the Secretary of Justice ordered their release, the NBI Director suspended the release to avoid potential contempt of the issuing court [1, 2]. The owners filed a motion for the return of the machines, which the Director opposed on the ground that they were a public nuisance and illegal *per se* [2, 3]. The CFI of Rizal granted the motion and ordered the return of the machines, prompting the Director to appeal to the Supreme Court [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the slot machines constitute a nuisance *per se* or are illegal to operate. [3]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order, ruling that the operation of the slot machines was neither illegal nor constituted a nuisance [5, 6].

The Court held that the Charter of Pasay City (Republic Act No. 183, Section 16[n]) expressly authorizes its Municipal Board to regulate and fix license fees for slot machines [7, 8]. Since the Board passed Municipal Ordinance No. 106 fixing such fees, and the petitioners paid them to secure corresponding licenses, the operation was lawful [5, 8].

The Court distinguished this case from *Philips v. Municipal Mayor* (G.R. No. L-9183), which held that a Caloocan ordinance authorizing slot machines was illegal. Unlike the Municipal Council of Caloocan, the Municipal Board of Pasay City was granted the specific power by its Charter to regulate slot machines [8, 9]. Furthermore, the Court noted that a slot machine is not a gambling device *per se* as it can be operated legally for amusement [6].

**Disposition**: The order appealed from is hereby affirmed [6].
