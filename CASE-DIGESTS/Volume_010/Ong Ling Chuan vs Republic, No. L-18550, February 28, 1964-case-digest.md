I. CAPTION
ALBERT ONG LING CHUAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18550, February 28, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Albert Ong Ling Chuan, born in Quezon in 1938, applied for naturalization as a Filipino citizen [1]. He claimed to be employed at Cosmos Industrial Company, a firm owned by his brother-in-law, earning P2,400.00 annually (P200.00 a month) with free board and lodging [1, 2]. To support his petition, he presented three character witnesses: Pedro del Mundo, Domingo Cabatingan, and Atty. Apolonio Gonzales [3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila granted the petition on May 20, 1961 [4]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that the petitioner’s witnesses were not credible and that he did not possess a lucrative occupation [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the character witnesses presented by the petitioner were credible.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the witnesses were biased, unreliable, and untrustworthy, failing to meet the requirement of being "credible persons" under the Naturalization Law [6]. A credible person must have good standing in the community and be reputed as trustworthy [7]. Here, witness Del Mundo lacked sufficient opportunity to observe the petitioner's conduct as he only saw him intermittently [6]. Witness Cabatingan was indebted to the petitioner's father for securing his business license, and witness Atty. Gonzales was the lawyer for the petitioner's father, casting doubt on their impartiality and disqualifying them as insurers of the petitioner's character [6].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that a salary of P200.00 a month is not considered lucrative. Considering the low buying power of the peso, such an income is insufficient to meet the statutory requirement [2, 8]. The Court relied on the rulings in *R. Ong v. Republic* and *Keng Giok v. Republic* [2].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is REVERSED and the petition is DENIED [9].
