I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PEPITO ARGANA, ET AL., defendants, PROCESO TANSIANCO and MARCIAL SAMIANO, defendants-appellants, G.R. No. L-19448, February 28, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On January 21, 1960, accused Pepito Argana, Cornelio Nave, and appellants Proceso Tansianco and Marcial Samiano hired a jeepney driven by Manolo de Guzman in Sta. Cruz, Laguna. While traveling to Paete, upon reaching a secluded spot in Kalayaan, Samiano brandished a pistol and declared a hold-up. On Samiano’s orders, Argana struck the driver twice on the nape with the pistol butt, killing him. Tansianco stepped on the victim's prostrate body before they fled with the jeep.

During the trial, Argana pleaded guilty and testified for the prosecution, detailing the appellants' participation. Co-accused Nave had executed an extra-judicial confession implicating the appellants but repudiated it in court, claiming he signed it without knowledge of its contents. The Court of First Instance of Laguna convicted the appellants of robbery with homicide based on Argana’s testimony and Nave’s confession. Tansianco and Samiano appealed, arguing that the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice and the extra-judicial confession of a co-accused were insufficient to sustain a conviction, and interposed the defense of alibi.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the testimony of an accomplice and the extra-judicial confession of a co-accused are sufficient to convict the appellants.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The testimony of a single witness, even if an accomplice, is sufficient to convict if it is credible and positive and satisfies the court beyond reasonable doubt [1]. In this case, Argana’s testimony was found credible and was corroborated by the extra-judicial confession of Nave.

Regarding the extra-judicial confessions, the Court ruled that while generally inadmissible against co-accused, "interlocking confessions" serve as strong indications of participation. Since the confessions of Argana and Nave were identical in essential details, with no proof of collusion, and corroborated by other evidence, they are admissible to prove conspiracy and establish the appellants' participation in the crime [*People v. Cariño*, G.R. No. L-9580; *People v. Zipagan*, 64 Phil. 757]. The defense of alibi was rejected as it could not prevail over positive identification.

Decision affirmed.
