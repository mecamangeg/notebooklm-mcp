I. CAPTION
PANGASINAN TRANSPORTATION CO., INC. v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and CECILIO GATDULA, G.R. No. L-16490, January 30, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Cecilio Gatdula stopped working for petitioner Pangasinan Transportation Co., Inc. on January 23, 1955. He filed his notice of injury and claim for compensation only on September 2, 1957, more than two years later. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) ruled in favor of Gatdula, holding that although the claim was filed beyond the two-month period prescribed by law, the claim was not barred because the petitioner had actual knowledge of Gatdula's ailment and had ordered him to stop working. The WCC relied on Section 27 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, which states that failure to give notice is not a bar if the employer had knowledge of the accident. The Supreme Court initially affirmed the WCC's decision on June 29, 1963. Petitioner filed this Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that Section 27 applies only to the notice of injury and not to the claim for compensation.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the employer's actual knowledge of the employee's injury excuses the failure to file a claim for compensation within the statutory period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court granted the Motion for Reconsideration and held that the claim was barred. The Court reasoned that the Workmen's Compensation Act clearly distinguishes between the **notice of injury** and the **claim for compensation**. Under Section 24, notice must be given "as soon as possible," while a claim must be filed within two months. Furthermore, Section 27, which allows "actual knowledge" as an excuse for delay, applies *exclusively* to the notice of injury [1].

The only statutory excuse for a late **claim** for compensation under Section 24 is if the employer has voluntarily made compensation payments [2, 3]. Since the petitioner did not make any such payments, the award by the WCC was not warranted in law [3]. The Court emphasized that failing to present a claim within the legal time limit is jurisdictional and fatal to the proceedings [4].

The Motion for Reconsideration is **GRANTED**; the previous decision of June 29, 1963 is **SET ASIDE**; and the award of the Workmen's Compensation Commission is **REVERSED** and the claim **DISMISSED**.
