I. CAPTION
PEDRO SAN DIEGO v. THE AUDITOR GENERAL, G.R. No. L-15460, January 31, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pedro San Diego, a Lieutenant Colonel in the AFP, retired on March 8, 1948, due to physical disability under Commonwealth Act (CA) No. 1 and received a lump sum gratuity of P16,335.00. He was later employed by the Philippine Council for United States Aid (Philcusa) from November 1, 1951, to October 15, 1953, receiving an annual salary of P6,000.00. Upon the enactment of Republic Act No. 803 in 1952, petitioner exercised his option to switch from the lump sum gratuity to a lifetime monthly pension, retroactive to his 1948 retirement. The government granted the accumulated pensions, deducting the gratuity previously received. However, the Respondent Auditor General withheld the pension corresponding to the period of petitioner's employment with Philcusa (Nov. 1, 1951 – Oct. 15, 1953), ruling that he could not retain the pension for that period without refunding the salary he received. Petitioner appealed, arguing that CA No. 246 did not apply as he was not receiving a monthly pension at the time of his re-employment.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner may retain the pension corresponding to the period of his re-employment in the government without refunding the salary received for that same period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that a retiree re-entering government service cannot receive both the pension/gratuity and the compensation for the position for the same period. Relying on Section 7-1(9) of CA No. 246 and the doctrine in *Peralta v. Auditor General*, the Court explained that the law's purpose is to prevent the payment of both compensation and pension to any official for the same period of time. The prohibition applies regardless of whether the retiree received the pension in a lump sum or monthly installments. Therefore, the petitioner cannot retain the portion of the gratuity or pension corresponding to the dates of his Philcusa employment without refunding the salary received. The ruling of the Auditor General was affirmed.
