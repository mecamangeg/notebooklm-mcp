I. CAPTION
THE CITY LUMBER, INC. v. THE HON. MELECIO R. DOMINGO, Commissioner of Internal Revenue and THE HON. COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-18611, January 30, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed petitioner City Lumber, Inc. for additional income tax liability based on undisclosed sales of plywood, nails, and GI sheets, and a cash credit balance considered as unreported income [1]. Petitioner contested the assessment, claiming the goods were looted during a fire in Dumaguete City and that the cash credit balance was actually a secured loan [1, 2]. To prove the loss, petitioner presented the Dumaguete Chief of Police, who testified that looting occurred but noted some items were recovered and returned [2].

Petitioner also argued that the assessment was invalid because a Regional Director had previously reinvestigated the case and reduced the liability to P176.00 pursuant to Memorandum Order No. V-634, which granted Regional Directors authority to close tax cases involving less than P10,000 [3]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) upheld the CIR's assessment, noting that the petitioner failed to report the alleged loss in its books or income tax return and failed to produce receipts evidencing the alleged loan [2, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner proved the alleged fire loss and the existence of the loan to justify avoiding the tax liability.
2. W/N the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is bound by the Regional Director’s previous order closing the tax case.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner's conduct in not reporting the alleged fire loss in its books of account or income tax return proved that the loss was not actually suffered [4]. Similarly, regarding the cash credit balance, the petitioner failed to record the alleged loan in its books or produce any receipts or evidence to prove a loan was secured [4].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue cannot delegate the power to make a final assessment to a subordinate [3]. Memorandum Order No. V-634 applies only to subordinate officers and cannot bind the Commissioner himself, who is entrusted by law with the duty to make final assessments [3]. Applying the principle *delegatus non potest delegare* (a delegated power cannot be further delegated), the Regional Director's action did not preclude the Commissioner from issuing the final assessment [3].

Decision affirmed [5].
