I. CAPTION
STA. CECILIA SAWMILLS, INC., petitioner, vs. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and TAGKAWAYAN LABOR UNION, respondents, G.R. Nos. L-19273-74, February 29, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
In March 1954, respondent Tagkawayan Labor Union (TLU) made various demands upon petitioner Sta. Cecilia Sawmills, Inc. (Company) regarding working conditions [1]. To silence these demands, the Company entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the National Labor Union (NLU) on March 1, 1954, which included a closed-shop provision [1, 2]. The Company subsequently dismissed employees who were members of TLU for refusing to affiliate with NLU [3]. TLU filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), charging the Company with Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) for coercing affiliation with NLU and refusing to bargain [3, 4].

The CIR found the Company guilty of ULP, declared the strike legal, and ordered the reinstatement of 113 dismissed employees with backwages from dismissal until reinstatement, as well as the reinstatement of 288 strikers [5, 6]. The Company appealed, arguing that the CIR prosecutor failed to conduct a preliminary investigation, that the closed-shop agreement was valid, and that the award of backwages was unjust since the sawmills ceased operations in July 1954 [4, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the ULP charge was valid despite the alleged lack of preliminary investigation by the prosecutor.
2. W/N the closed-shop agreement with NLU applies to TLU members (old employees).
3. W/N the strike declared by TLU was legal.
4. W/N the award of backwages without time limitation is valid.
5. W/N the 288 strikers are entitled to reinstatement.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A previous hearing conducted by the CIR itself before the filing of the information constitutes sufficient investigation to support the charge [8]. The evidence adduced at the previous hearing established a *prima facie* case warranting the filing of the complaint [8].

2. **NO.** A closed-shop agreement applies only to persons to be hired or employees who are not yet members of any labor organization [9]. It is inapplicable to those already in the service who are members of another union [9]. Compelling TLU members to join NLU within two months destroys their freedom to choose their representative and constitutes Unfair Labor Practice [10]. The Court cited *Freeman Shirt Manufacturing Co. v. CIR*, holding that forcing minority union members to disaffiliate and join the contracting union violates the Industrial Peace Act [9].

3. **YES.** The strike is legal because it was resorted to when TLU members were being forced by the Company to join the rival union (NLU) and was preceded by various demands which were not granted [7].

4. **NO.** An order for reinstatement with backwages without limitation is invalid and unjust, especially since the Company's sawmills closed due to losses in July 1954, shortly after the dismissals [7, 11]. Dismissed laborers are expected to find other employment to minimize losses [12]. The Court modified the award, limiting backwages to a reasonable period of three months [6].

5. **NO.** The 288 alleged strikers were found to be contract workers or independent workers who were not actually working or dismissed at the time of the strike; they merely joined to show sympathy [6]. Only the 113 actually dismissed employees are entitled to reinstatement and backwages [6].

**Judgment affirmed with modification.** The award of backwages is limited to three months, and the order reinstating the 288 strikers is set aside [13].
