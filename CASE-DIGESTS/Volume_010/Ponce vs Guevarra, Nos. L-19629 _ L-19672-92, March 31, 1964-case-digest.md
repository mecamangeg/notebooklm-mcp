I. CAPTION
GUILLERMO PONCE v. MARCELO GUEVARRA, RICARDO DINGLASAN, FRANCISCO GUEVARRA, TIBURCIO DE JESUS, et al., G.R. Nos. L-19629 & L-19672-92, March 31, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Guillermo Ponce and his wife, the registered owners of 72 hectares of land in Laguna, leased the property to Miguel Donato for five years starting in the 1950-1951 crop year. The lease contract prohibited subleasing without the owners' written consent. However, Donato subleased the land to respondents (Guevarra, et al.) as tenant-lessees without such consent. Ponce was aware of this arrangement but subsequently executed deeds in 1956 extending Donato's lease for two years. Upon the expiration of the lease in 1958, Ponce filed complaints with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) to enjoin the respondents from cultivating the holdings and to recover damages, arguing that their tenancy rights expired with the lease and that the sublease was void. The CAR dismissed the cases, ruling that respondents were tenant-lessees entitled to security of tenure. Ponce appealed, contending that the implied tenancy was invalid and that agrarian reform laws should not apply retroactively to impair vested rights.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the tenancy relationship between the respondents and the landholder was extinguished by the expiration of the lease contract between the landholder and the civil law lessee.
2. W/N R.A. No. 1199 and R.A. No. 2263 apply retroactively to cases pending at the time of their enactment.
3. W/N the violation of the lease provision against subleasing justifies the ejectment of the respondents.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The tenancy relationship is not extinguished by the expiration of the civil lease. Under Section 9 of R.A. No. 1199, as amended by R.A. No. 2263, the expiration of the period of the contract, or the sale, alienation, or transfer of legal possession of the land does not of itself extinguish the relationship [1, 2]. In such cases, the transferee (Ponce, upon the return of the land) assumes the rights and obligations of the former landholder (Donato) in relation to the tenant [2]. Therefore, the return of the leased property to the lessor involves a transfer of legal possession governed by the security of tenure provisions of the law, entitling the tenants to remain on the land [3].

2. **YES.** R.A. No. 2263 expressly provides that its provisions shall apply to all cases pending in any court at the time of its approval [4]. Since this case was pending in the lower court when the law was enacted on June 19, 1959, the amendments regarding security of tenure are applicable [4]. The application of agrarian laws to contracts made prior to their enactment is a valid exercise of the state's police power [4].

3. **NO.** While subleasing without written consent violated the original lease, the breach was committed by the lessee (Donato), not the respondents, who were not parties to that contract [5]. Furthermore, Ponce condoned the breach when he extended the lifetime of the lease in 1956 with full knowledge that the respondents were holding and cultivating the land as tenant-lessees of Donato [5]. Consequently, they cannot be ejected except for causes specified by law and upon judicial authority [6].

The petition is denied, and the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations is affirmed.
