I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. CAPITOL SUBDIVISION, INC., G.R. No. L-18993, April 30, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Capitol Subdivision, Inc. filed its income tax returns for the years 1948 to 1951. On April 8, 1953, petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) issued assessment notices for deficiency income taxes totaling P27,212.88 based on disallowed deductions [1, 2]. On May 30, 1953, Respondent requested an itemized breakdown of the disallowed "General Expenses," stating they would explain the items if they found the breakdown unsatisfactory [3, 4].

On June 21, 1955, the CIR demanded payment, effectively denying the request. Respondent reiterated its request for explanation on July 1, 1955, which the CIR denied on September 20, 1955 [5]. On October 15, 1955, Respondent explained the items and requested a reinvestigation [5]. Finally, on September 2, 1959, the CIR demanded payment again. Respondent invoked the defense of prescription on September 16, 1959, arguing that more than five years had passed since the 1953 assessment [6, 7]. The CIR filed its answer in the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) on December 29, 1959, which constituted a judicial action for collection [8, 9]. The CTA ruled that the CIR's right to collect had prescribed, as 6 years, 8 months, and 21 days had elapsed since the assessment [8]. The CIR appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's right to collect the deficiency income taxes has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the CTA decision. Under Section 332(c) of the National Internal Revenue Code, the government has five years after the assessment of the tax to institute a judicial action for collection [3, 10]. However, the prescriptive period is interrupted when the taxpayer requests a review or reconsideration of the assessment and begins to run again when said request is denied [9, 11].

The Court held that Respondent's letter of May 30, 1953, requesting itemized information, constituted a request for review or reconsideration because it questioned the correctness of the assessment [9]. This request interrupted the prescriptive period until the CIR's demand for payment on June 21, 1955. Deducting this period of interruption (May 30, 1953 to June 21, 1955, or 2 years and 21 days) from the total time elapsed between the assessment and the judicial action (6 years, 8 months, and 21 days), the effective time run was only 4 years and 8 months [9]. This is within the five-year statutory limitation.

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is set aside, and the taxpayer's petition to declare the assessments null and void is dismissed [12].
