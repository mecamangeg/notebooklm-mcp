I. CAPTION
ANDRES ROMERO v. MAIDEN FORM BRASSIERE CO., INC. and THE DIRECTOR OF PATENTS, G.R. No. L-18289, March 31, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On February 12, 1957, respondent Maiden Form Brassiere Co., Inc., a foreign corporation, applied for the registration of the trademark "Adagio" for its brassieres, alleging continuous use in the Philippines for over 30 years (since 1932 or 1946). The Director of Patents approved the application and issued the certificate of registration on October 17, 1957.

On February 26, 1958, petitioner Andres Romero filed a petition for cancellation of the registration. Romero argued that "Adagio" had become a common descriptive name for a particular style of brassiere and was therefore unregistrable. He claimed that local manufacturers had used the term since 1948 without objection. He further contended that the trademark had been abandoned due to non-use during a period of government import restrictions. The Director of Patents dismissed Romero's petition, finding the mark arbitrary and fanciful. Romero appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trademark "Adagio" is registrable or merely a common descriptive name for a brassiere style.
2. W/N the trademark was abandoned due to temporary non-use caused by government restrictions.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that "Adagio" is registrable. It is a musical term meaning "slowly" or "in an easy manner" and is used in an arbitrary and fanciful sense when applied to brassieres [1]. It is not a common descriptive name. The Court held that the mere fact that a manufacturer uses a trademark to designate a particular style or type of product does not affect the validity of the word as a trademark, citing *Kiekhaefer Corp. v. Willys-Overland Motors, Inc.* [2, 3]. Furthermore, the respondent had not acquiesced to local use; it had issued warnings and advertisements against unlawful use [2].

2. **NO.** The Court held that temporary non-use occasioned by government restrictions is not deemed abandonment. To work an abandonment, the disuse must be permanent, intentional, and voluntary [4]. Non-use because of legal restrictions is not evidence of an intent to abandon (*Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Budweiser Malt Products Corp.*) [5, 6]. The respondent was the first user of the mark in the Philippines (since 1932), and its temporary inability to import due to restrictions did not forfeit its rights [7, 8].

The decision of the Director of Patents is **AFFIRMED**.
