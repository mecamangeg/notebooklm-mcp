I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BUENAVENTURA MARIANO Y TABAQUIN, G.R. No. L-19243, February 29, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant Buenaventura Mariano was charged in the Court of First Instance of Manila with illegally engaging in the business of carrying mail without authority [1]. After his arraignment on September 26, 1960, the hearing was postponed several times at the instance of the defendant for reasons including reinvestigation, change of counsel, and the filing of a motion to quash [1], [2]. The trial was eventually set for June 7, 1961 [1]. On June 3, 1961, four days before the trial, the defendant moved for the appointment of assessors [1]. The lower court denied the motion on the grounds that the appointment was discretionary and that the motion was merely part of the defense's dilatory tactics [1], [2]. Mariano appealed the order [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the order denying the motion for the appointment of assessors is appealable.
2. W/N the trial court erred in denying the motion for the appointment of assessors.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The order denying the appointment of assessors is interlocutory in nature and is not appealable separately from the main case [3], [4], [5]. The proper remedy would have been for the defendant to apply for a writ of *certiorari* and *mandamus* [5]. However, the Supreme Court chose to resolve the legal issue raised to prevent it from being reiterated in the future should the case be decided unfavorably against the defendant [5].

2. **NO.** While the appointment of assessors in the City of Manila is generally mandatory upon the filing of a motion pursuant to Section 154 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Section 49 of the Manila Charter (*Berbari v. Concepcion*; *Primicias v. Ocampo*), an exception exists when the motion is used for dilatory purposes [6], [7], [2], [8]. The Court found that the defendant's motion was purely dilatory, as it was filed over eight months after arraignment and just days before trial, following numerous postponements requested by the defense [9], [8]. Furthermore, the issues regarding the unauthorized carriage of mail did not materially depend on the appreciation of testimonial credibility, for which assessors are most useful [9]. A request for assessors must be made at the "earliest convenient time" so as not to hinder or delay the trial (*Berbari v. Concepcion*) [8].

The order appealed from is affirmed [10].
