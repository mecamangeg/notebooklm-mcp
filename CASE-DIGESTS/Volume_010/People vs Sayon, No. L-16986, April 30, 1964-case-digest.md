I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES and CRISTETA GENABE v. SABAS SAYON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16986, April 30, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On May 21, 1957, the Provincial Fiscal of Davao filed an information in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao against Sabas Sayon and others for the crime of theft of abaca plants valued at P90.00. The offense was committed within the territorial jurisdiction of Davao City. Due to the penalty involved, the case fell within the concurrent jurisdiction of the Municipal Court and the CFI. The defendants filed a motion to quash, arguing that under the Charter of the City of Davao, the City Attorney had the exclusive authority to investigate and prosecute crimes committed within the city, and the Provincial Fiscal lacked authority to initiate the information. The CFI sustained the motion and dismissed the information. The Solicitor General appealed the order of dismissal to the Supreme Court [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Provincial Fiscal of Davao has the authority to conduct preliminary investigations and file informations for offenses committed within Davao City that are triable by the Court of First Instance.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the Provincial Fiscal has such authority. Under Section 19(e) of Commonwealth Act No. 51 (Charter of the City of Davao), there is a clear delimitation of authority: the City Attorney has charge of prosecuting crimes triable in the Municipal Court, while the Provincial Fiscal has charge of all prosecutions "appealed to, or brought before, the Court of First Instance of Davao" [3, 4].

The phrase "brought before" implies cases filed directly with the CFI. Since the Provincial Fiscal is charged with the prosecution of offenses committed in the City and triable in the CFI, he is deemed vested with the power to make the necessary preliminary investigations and file the corresponding informations [5]. To deny him this power would "hobble him unduly" in his duty to prosecute and would incorrectly make the City Attorney's findings conclusive upon him [5]. Prosecution is not limited to the trial but includes the process of investigation leading to the charge. Consequently, the Provincial Fiscal may exercise the authority granted by Republic Act No. 732 to conduct investigations for such cases [6].

The order of dismissal was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [7].
