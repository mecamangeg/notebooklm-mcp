I. CAPTION
NATIONAL MARKETING CORPORATION v. HON. BIENVENIDO TAN, FEDERATION OF UNITED NAMARCO DISTRIBUTORS, INC., et al., G.R. No. L-17074, March 31, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On November 16, 1959, petitioner National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO) and respondent Federation of United NAMARCO Distributors, Inc. (Federation) executed a contract of sale for the importation and distribution of $2,001,031.00 worth of commodities [1, 2]. This contract was authorized by NAMARCO Board Resolution No. 524 and later approved by Resolution No. 14 [3, 4]. The Federation paid over P2,000,000.00 in advances and storage charges, and NAMARCO initially released goods stored in "Pasig River Bodegas" [5].

However, in January 1960, a new Board of Directors and General Manager took over NAMARCO and refused further releases, alleging the contract was invalid for lack of Auditor General approval and for violating Board Resolution No. 530 which prohibited "forward sales" [6, 7]. The Federation filed an action for specific performance with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The trial court judge, Hon. Bienvenido Tan, issued a writ of preliminary injunction and subsequent orders directing the release of commodities to the Federation upon the latter's consignation of payments [8]. NAMARCO filed a petition for certiorari, alleging the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in ordering the release of the commodities under the contested contract of sale.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the writ and dissolved the injunction against the lower court [10]. The Court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion because the contract of sale was valid and binding.

First, the contract was duly authorized by Board Resolution No. 524 and approved by Resolution No. 14 [3]. The alleged conflict with Resolution No. 530 (prohibiting forward sales) did not invalidate the contract because the specific importation was an exception recommended by the President and the Federation members were regular NAMARCO outlets [11, 12].

Second, the lack of formal approval by the Auditor General did not amount to disapproval. The Auditor General merely returned the contract without action pending the result of the court case, effectively subordinating his action to the judicial decision [13, 14].

Finally, NAMARCO was estopped from questioning the contract's validity because it had voluntarily complied with it until January 1960 and had even filed a separate collection suit (Civil Case No. 46124) against the Federation to enforce payment under the same contract [15].

The petition was denied.
