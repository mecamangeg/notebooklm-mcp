I. CAPTION
THE HEIRS OF THE DECEASED JUAN SINDIONG v. THE COMMITTEE ON BURNT AREAS AND IMPROVEMENTS OF CEBU and BERNARDO BENEDICTO, G.R. No. L-15975, April 30, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On January 5, 1922, the Land Registration Court adjudicated an undivided one-fourth share of Lot 2154 to the Heirs of Juan Sindiong (Petitioners) and ordered the Committee on Burnt Areas and Improvements of Cebu (Committee) to execute the corresponding deed of transfer. The original titles were destroyed during the war. In 1948, the titles were administratively reconstituted, and TCT No. 4885 was eventually issued in the name of respondent Bernardo Benedicto on May 18, 1950.

It was only in April 1956 that the Heirs filed a case to enforce the 1922 adjudication, which was dismissed for suing the wrong party (City of Cebu instead of the Committee). On September 12, 1958, the Heirs filed the present action against the Committee and Benedicto to compel the execution of the conveyance and eject Benedicto. The Court of First Instance of Cebu dismissed the complaint on the grounds of laches and prescription.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Heirs’ cause of action is barred by laches and prescription.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal.

First, regarding **laches**, the Court held that the Heirs allowed more than 34 years to elapse from the 1922 adjudication before attempting to enforce their rights in 1956. This significant delay constitutes laches, which cannot be allowed to impair the rights of third parties, specifically respondent Benedicto, who acquired rights to the property in due course and without bad faith.

Second, regarding **prescription**, the Court ruled that the cause of action had prescribed. An action to enforce a decision of the Land Registration Court is considered based on a written instrument, which prescribes upon the expiration of ten years from the date the decision became final. Since the present action was filed in 1958—over 35 years after the cause of action accrued—it is barred by the statute of limitations.

The resolution appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
