I. CAPTION
SOCORRO A. GILLERA v. CORAZON FERNANDEZ and ABELARDO SUBIDO, G.R. No. L-20741, January 31, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On December 26, 1961, outgoing President Carlos P. Garcia extended an *ad interim* appointment to petitioner Socorro A. Gillera as a Member of the Board of Pharmaceutical Examiners for a fixed term of three years to replace Dr. Federico Cruz, whose term was expiring on December 28, 1961 [1]. Gillera accepted, took her oath, and assumed office on December 28, 1961, preparing examination questions for the upcoming January 1962 board exams [1].

However, on December 31, 1961, the Executive Secretary informed Gillera that her appointment was recalled pursuant to President Diosdado Macapagal’s Administrative Order No. 2, which withdrew "midnight appointments" made by the outgoing administration [1], [2]. To prevent disruption of the exams, President Macapagal designated Gillera as "Acting Member" on January 11, 1962 [2]. Meanwhile, the Commission on Appointments confirmed her original December 26 *ad interim* appointment on May 9, 1962 [2]. On December 29, 1962, respondent Corazon Fernandez was appointed to the position held by Gillera [3]. Gillera filed a petition for *quo warranto* and prohibition, claiming her removal was illegal [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner’s *ad interim* appointment was validly recalled or withdrawn by the President's Administrative Order No. 2. [4]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner's appointment was valid and effective. The Court clarified its ruling in *Aytona v. Castillo*, stating that it did not categorically declare Administrative Order No. 2 valid or all "midnight appointments" ineffective [5]. Rather, the *Aytona* decision was based on the "doubtful character" of mass appointments made in a "mad scramble" [5], [6].

Citing *Merrera v. Liwag*, the Court held that appointments by an outgoing President are valid if they are few, spaced to afford assurance of deliberate action, and carefully consider the appointee's qualifications [7]. Here, Gillera’s appointment was extended on December 26 (before the "mad scramble"), she was qualified, and there was an exigency of service due to the upcoming January exams—a necessity recognized even by the new President when he designated her in an acting capacity [6]. Thus, the appointment was a result of deliberate action and was validly confirmed by the Commission on Appointments [6].

The petition is granted; petitioner's appointment is declared valid, and respondent Fernandez is directed to vacate the position [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Padilla, J. (Dissenting):**
Reiterated his view in *Aytona* that *ad interim* appointments by an outgoing President lapse on December 30. Since Gillera was not re-appointed *ad interim* by the new President, her confirmation by the Commission on Appointments was invalid as there was no existing appointment to confirm [9].
