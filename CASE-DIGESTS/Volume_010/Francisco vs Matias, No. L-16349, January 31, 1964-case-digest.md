I. CAPTION
IN RE TESTATE ESTATE OF DOÑA GABINA RAQUEL. VICENTE J. FRANCISCO v. AUREA MATIAS, G.R. No. L-16349, January 31, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In May 1952, Aurea Matias (Matias) filed a petition for the probate of the will of Gabina Raquel, which was opposed by the deceased’s cousin. Matias engaged Atty. Vicente J. Francisco (Francisco) to handle the case [1]. They signed a written contract stipulating a total fee of P20,000 (P5,000 down payment and P15,000 contingent on success) plus P200 per hearing [2]. After four years of trial, the Court of First Instance (CFI) denied the probate. However, on appeal, Francisco secured a reversal from the Supreme Court, validating the will [3].

Subsequently, Francisco filed a motion to fix his fees based on *quantum meruit* (reasonable value of services), alleging that Matias misrepresented the estate's value as only P167,000 when it was actually worth over P1 million, making the stipulated fee unconscionable [4]. Matias objected, insisting on the written contract [5]. The lower court disregarded the contract and fixed the fees at 25% of the estate's current market value, estimated at P1,236,993.46 [6], [7]. Matias appealed, arguing the contract should prevail, the fees should be based on assessed value, and they should be charged to her personally, not the estate [7], [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the attorney's fees should be determined by *quantum meruit* despite the existence of a written contract.
2. W/N the attorney's fees are chargeable against the estate.
3. W/N the award of 25% of the current market value of the estate is reasonable.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While a valid written contract generally fixes the compensation, the Court ruled that *quantum meruit* became the issue because Matias' counsel agreed in open court to debate the "reasonable amount" of the fees, thereby repudiating the contractual stipulation [9], [10]. Furthermore, the Court found it probable that Francisco was misled regarding the estate's value, as an experienced lawyer would not have agreed to a contingent fee of only 1.6% (P15,000) for an estate worth over a million pesos [11], [12].

2. **YES.** The fees are properly chargeable against the estate. Upholding the will serves the interest of the estate by enforcing the testator's command [13]. Moreover, Matias is estopped from denying the estate's liability because she contracted Francisco in her capacity as executrix, listed the fees as a lien on the estate in her accounts, and paid the initial fees from estate funds [14], [15], [16].

3. **NO.** The Court modified the award, reducing it to **12.5% of the market value** of the estate [17], [18]. While Francisco rendered extensive services involving complicated questions of law and successfully reversed an adverse judgment [19], [20], the original 25% award was deemed excessive. The Court considered that Francisco had assistants, originally agreed to a much lower fee based on his belief of the estate's value, and had previously expressed willingness to accept P100,000 [21]. The 12.5% rate is reasonable given the contingent nature of the fee and the high professional standing of the counsel [22], [18].

**Decision affirmed with modification.**
