I. CAPTION
PAZ P. ARRIETA and VITALIADO ARRIETA v. NATIONAL RICE AND CORN CORPORATION and MANILA UNDERWRITERS INSURANCE CO., INC., G.R. No. L-15645, January 31, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On May 19, 1952, Paz P. Arrieta participated in a public bidding called by the National Rice and Corn Corporation (NARIC) for the supply of 20,000 metric tons of Burmese rice [1]. Being the lowest bidder, she entered into a Contract of Sale of Rice with NARIC on July 1, 1952 [1]. Under the contract, Arrieta obligated herself to deliver the rice, while NARIC committed to pay "by means of an irrevocable, confirmed and assignable letter of credit in U.S. currency... immediately" [1].

However, NARIC only applied for the letter of credit (L/C) on July 30, 1952, a month after the contract was signed [2]. The Philippine National Bank (PNB) approved the application on August 4, 1952, subject to the condition that NARIC pay a 50% marginal cash deposit [3]. NARIC could not meet this financial requirement, as it admitted in a letter to PNB that it did not have sufficient funds [4, 5]. Consequently, the L/C was only opened on September 8, 1952 [6].

Due to the delay, Arrieta’s supplier in Burma cancelled the rice allocation on August 20, 1952, and forfeited Arrieta’s 5% deposit amounting to approximately P200,000.00 [6]. Arrieta attempted to substitute Thailand rice, but NARIC rejected the offer [7]. Arrieta then sued for damages representing unrealized profits. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in her favor, awarding $286,000.00 [8]. NARIC appealed, arguing the delay was Arrieta's fault for not providing necessary data and that her offer to substitute rice constituted a waiver [9, 10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N NARIC is liable for damages for the breach of contract due to the delay in opening the letter of credit.
2. W/N the award of damages in U.S. dollars is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed NARIC's liability, holding that the delay in opening the L/C was the immediate cause of the cancellation of the rice allocation and the consequent damages [11]. The Court rejected NARIC's defense that Arrieta failed to furnish necessary data, noting that the true cause of delay was NARIC's inability to meet the bank's 50% cash deposit requirement [12].

The Court applied **Article 1170 of the Civil Code**, which provides that those guilty of fraud, negligence, delay, or who "in any manner contravene the tenor" of their obligations are liable for damages [13]. The phrase "in any manner contravene the tenor" includes any illicit act that impairs the strict and faithful fulfillment of the obligation [10]. NARIC's culpability arose from its "willful and deliberate assumption of contractual obligations" knowing it was financially incapable of meeting the bank's requirements to open the L/C immediately [14, 15]. Furthermore, the Court ruled that Arrieta's offer to substitute Thailand rice was not a waiver of the breach, as waivers must be clearly and convincingly shown and are not presumed [10].

2. **NO.** The Court modified the lower court's decision regarding the currency of payment. Citing **Republic Act No. 529**, the Court ruled that the discharge of obligations must be in Philippine legal tender [16]. Therefore, the award of $286,000.00 was converted into Philippine Pesos. The applicable exchange rate is the rate prevailing at the time the obligation was incurred (July 1, 1952), not at the time of the judgment, pursuant to the policy against stipulations of foreign currencies in domestic contracts [17, 18].

**Decision affirmed with modification.** The award is converted to Philippine Pesos at the exchange rate prevailing on July 1, 1952. [18]
