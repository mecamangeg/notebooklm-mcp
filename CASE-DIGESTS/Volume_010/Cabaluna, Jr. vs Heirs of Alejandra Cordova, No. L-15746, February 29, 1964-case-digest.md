I. CAPTION
TESTATE ESTATE OF ZABALA. SALVADOR A. CABALUNA, JR., Administrator v. HEIRS OF ALEJANDRA CORDOVA, G.R. No. L-15746, February 29, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Rev. Mensueto Zabala died leaving a will designating Alejandra Cordova as universal heir. Upon Cordova's death, her heirs (oppositors-appellants) succeeded her. Atty. Venancio Bañares, former counsel for Cordova, was entitled to one-fifth (1/5) of the estate. In the probate proceedings, the heirs filed a project of partition dated August 20, 1956, while Atty. Bañares filed a counter-project. Without receiving evidence on either project, the trial court commissioned Atty. Julio Albis to prepare a "tentative" and later a "partial" project of partition. The court subsequently ordered that the estate be divided into parts similar to Bañares’ plan and that shares be assigned by drawing lots. The heirs opposed this method and refused to participate in the drawing of lots, repeatedly moving for a hearing to present evidence regarding the fairness of the partition, the valuation of the properties, and the correct share of Atty. Bañares. The trial court denied their motions, approved the Commissioner's partition, and ordered distribution based on the drawing of lots.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court denied the heirs due process by approving the partition and ordering distribution by lot without allowing the reception of evidence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the opposing heirs should not be deprived of their legitimate shares in the properties of the decedent without due process of law. There were no concrete facts proven or adduced upon which the trial court could base a conclusion as to which project of partition was the most just, equitable, and fair. The trial court compelled the heirs to participate in a drawing of lots based on groupings and values arbitrarily fixed by the Commissioner, without affording them the opportunity to prove the fair market value, location, and productivity of the lands, or to contest the exact share of Atty. Bañares. Consequently, the orders approving the partial project of partition and distributing properties by lot were set aside, and the case was remanded to the lower court for the reception of evidence to determine the legality and sufficiency of the project of partition.
