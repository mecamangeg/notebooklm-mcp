I. CAPTION
DAVAO STEEL CORPORATION v. JOSE R. CABATUANDO, Judge of the Court of Agrarian Relations, and CORNELIO CUYSON, G.R. No. L-19866, April 29, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Davao Steel Corporation purchased a parcel of land in Mandawe, Cebu, from Domingo Mendoza to use as a factory site [1]. Mendoza assured Petitioner there would be no trouble but failed to disclose that the land was tilled by Respondent Cornelio Cuyson, a 75-year-old tenant [2, 3]. Without contacting Cuyson, Petitioner cut down the corn crop, destroyed the sugarcane, and began constructing a factory, road, and walls [2, 3].

Cuyson filed a complaint for reinstatement and damages with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) [4]. Petitioner argued the CAR lacked jurisdiction because the land had been converted to industrial use, terminating the tenancy relationship [5]. Petitioner also sought to file a third-party complaint against the vendor, Mendoza, for misrepresentation, which the CAR denied [4]. The CAR ruled in favor of Cuyson, awarding actual and exemplary damages and ordering reinstatement to the agricultural portion of the land [4]. Petitioner appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction over the case despite the land's conversion to industrial use.
2. W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction over the third-party complaint against the vendor.
3. W/N the award of exemplary damages was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The conversion of agricultural land to industrial uses by a purchaser does not automatically terminate the tenancy relationship without the consent of the tenant or the Court [6]. Under Section 9 of the Tenancy Act, the Petitioner succeeded to the duties of the former landholder upon purchase, including the obligation to respect the tenant's tenure [5]. Since the dispute involves the rights of persons in the cultivation and use of agricultural land, it falls within the CAR's jurisdiction under Section 7 of R.A. 1267 [6].

2. **NO.** The third-party complaint against the vendor is not within the jurisdiction of the agrarian court because the Petitioner and the vendor do not have a tenancy relationship *inter se* [7]. The cause of action is based on tort (misrepresentation) and properly belongs to the jurisdiction of ordinary courts [7].

3. **YES.** Exemplary damages may be awarded in tenancy cases [8]. Section 55 of R.A. 1199 allows the application of general laws to acts between landlords and tenants, and the destruction of standing crops was an act of "arbitrary high-handedness" warranting such damages [8].

Decision affirmed [9].
