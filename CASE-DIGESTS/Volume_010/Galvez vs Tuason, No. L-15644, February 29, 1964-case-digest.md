I. CAPTION
MAXIMO L. GALVEZ and ELPIDIO TIBURCIO v. MARIANO SEVERO TUASON Y DE LA PAZ, ET AL., UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES (UP), and PEOPLE'S HOMESITE AND HOUSING CORPORATION (PHHC), G.R. No. L-15644, February 29, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On October 16, 1958, petitioners Galvez and Tiburcio, as heirs of Eladio Tiburcio, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal for the recovery of 430 hectares of land in Quezon City and the annulment of technical descriptions in OCT No. 735 [1]. They alleged that they had been in continuous adverse possession of the land, but discovered it was included in the Tuasons' title (OCT No. 735) via "detachable sheets" [1]. The Tuasons subsequently transferred the property to UP and PHHC [1].

UP and PHHC moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds of lack of cause of action and bar by prior judgment (res judicata) [2, 3]. Evidence presented showed that the ownership of the land had been previously litigated: (1) Marcelino Tiburcio's application for registration based on a Spanish title was dismissed and affirmed; (2) a civil case for reconveyance (Q-2663) filed by the heirs was dismissed and affirmed by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-13479; and (3) the land was originally registered to the Tuasons in 1914 [4-6]. The CFI dismissed the complaint [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action is barred by prior judgment.
2. W/N the complaint states a cause of action against UP and PHHC.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the action is barred because the question of ownership regarding the property in litigation is a matter "thrice settled definitely and conclusively by the courts, and must be deemed well beyond the reach of review" [6]. The Court cited the original 1914 registration in favor of the Tuasons, the final dismissal of the Tiburcio heirs' land registration application, and the final dismissal of their previous reconveyance suit [5, 6].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the complaint failed to state a cause of action against UP and PHHC [6]. While the complaint alleged the vendors' (Tuasons) title was defective, there was no allegation that UP and PHHC were purchasers in bad faith or had notice of the alleged defect in the title of their vendors [6, 7].

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [8].
