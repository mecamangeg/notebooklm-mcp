I. CAPTION
CHENG BAN YEK CO., INC. v. AUDITOR GENERAL, G.R. No. L-18354, March 31, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cheng Ban Yek Co., Inc. imported cottonseed oil from 1953 to 1955 for use in the manufacture of lard. The Auditor General rendered an opinion that the imported oil was a "component" rather than a "stabilizer," making it subject to the 17% special excise tax. Petitioner appealed this to the Supreme Court. In a decision dated December 29, 1962, the Court originally ruled against the petitioner. Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration submitting new technical evidence. Meanwhile, the Respondent Auditor General moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the "decision" appealed from was merely an indorsement/opinion rendered for the guidance of the Foreign Department of the Central Bank and not a final decision on a specific money claim.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the opinion of the Auditor General rendered for the guidance of the Central Bank is appealable under Rule 44 of the Rules of Court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the alleged decision appealed from was merely an opinion rendered by the respondent for the guidance of the Foreign Department of the Central Bank. It was not rendered in connection with a specific claim for refund by the petitioner or any other company. Therefore, it is not appealable under Section 1, Rule 44 of the Rules of Court. Given that the substantive issue regarding the classification of the oil is important and requires further evidentiary examination in an appropriate case, the Court deemed it improper to pass upon it in this proceeding.

ACCORDINGLY, the decision rendered on December 29, 1962 is SET ASIDE, and the appeal is DISMISSED.
