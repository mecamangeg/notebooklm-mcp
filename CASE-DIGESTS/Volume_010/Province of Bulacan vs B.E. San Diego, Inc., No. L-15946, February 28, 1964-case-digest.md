I. CAPTION
PROVINCE OF BULACAN v. B. E. SAN DlEGO, INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-15946, February 28, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On September 3, 1954, the Provincial Board of Bulacan passed Resolution No. 787 authorizing the expropriation of "Hacienda Esguerra," a property owned by B.E. San Diego, Inc. with an aggregate area of about 64 hectares situated in Meycauayan, Obando, and Polo [1]. The purpose was to subdivide and resell the land to tenants and landless residents pursuant to Republic Act Nos. 267 and 498 [1]. The Province filed the complaint, but the court later excluded approximately 38 hectares purchased by the Central Cooperative Exchange, Inc., leaving an amended complaint covering only about 26 hectares [2].

B.E. San Diego, Inc. moved to dismiss the amended complaint, arguing that the property was not a "landed estate" and thus outside the purview of the cited laws, and that several portions had already been sold to private parties [3]. The Court of First Instance of Bulacan dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, citing *Guido v. Rural Progress Administration* and *Republic v. Baylosis* [1, 4]. The Province appealed [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the 26-hectare property sought to be expropriated constitutes a "landed estate" subject to expropriation under Republic Act Nos. 267 and 498.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal.

The Court held that the land in question, situated in three different municipalities with a total area of about 26 hectares, is not a "landed estate" and is consequently beyond the purview of Republic Act Nos. 267 and 498 [5, 6]. Reaffirming the doctrine in *Guido v. Rural Progress Administration* and *Republic v. Baylosis*, the Court emphasized that under Section 4, Article XIII of the Constitution, the government may expropriate only landed estates with extensive areas, specifically those embracing the whole or a large part of a town or city [7, 8]. Once a landed estate is broken up and divided into parcels of reasonable areas, whether through voluntary sales or expropriation, the resulting parcels are no longer subject to further expropriation [8].

The Order appealed from is AFFIRMED [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Barrera, J., concurs in the result [9].
