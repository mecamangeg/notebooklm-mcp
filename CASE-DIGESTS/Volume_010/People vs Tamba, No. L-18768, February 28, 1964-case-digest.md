I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ARSENIA TAMBA Y LUQUIRO, G.R. No. L-18768, February 28, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Arsenia Tamba was charged with arson with homicide for willfully burning a house owned and inhabited by Carlos S. Gavila, which resulted in the death of a minor, Regino Gavila III [1]. The information alleged the burning and the death but did not expressly state that Tamba knew the house was occupied at the time [1, 2]. Assisted by counsel *de oficio*, Tamba pleaded guilty [3]. The Court of First Instance of Davao convicted her under Article 321, paragraph 1, in relation to Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), sentencing her to *reclusion perpetua* [3]. Tamba appealed, arguing that the lower court erred in applying Article 321, paragraph 1, because the information failed to allege that she had knowledge that the building was occupied when she set fire to it [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused can be convicted of arson with homicide under Article 321, paragraph 1 of the RPC if the information fails to allege knowledge that the building was occupied.

IV. RULING
**NO.** Knowledge on the part of the accused that the building set fire to is occupied is an essential element of the form of arson defined in Article 321, paragraph 1 of the RPC [2]. To sustain a conviction under this article, the information must contain specific allegations that the accused had such knowledge at the time of the commission of the crime [2]. Since a plea of guilty admits only what is alleged in the information, and the information here failed to allege such knowledge, Tamba can only be convicted of arson under Article 321, paragraph 2(b) of the RPC—burning an inhabited building, the offender not knowing whether or not such building was occupied [2].

The decision is **AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION**. The penalty is reduced to an indeterminate sentence of 12 years of *prision mayor* as minimum to 19 years, 1 month, and 10 days of *reclusion temporal* as maximum [4].
