I. CAPTION
RELIANCE SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and MANILA PORT SERVICE, G.R. No. L-19589, April 30, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On November 20, 1959, Insular La Yebana Tobacco Corporation imported six boxes of automotive spare parts, which were discharged and received in good order by the Manila Port Service on December 17, 1959 [1]. None of the boxes were delivered to the consignee, resulting in a loss [1]. The consignee filed a provisional claim for the missing cargo on March 28, 1960, which was several months after the discharge of the goods [2].

Reliance Surety & Insurance Company, having paid the insurance claim to the consignee, sued the Manila Railroad Company and Manila Port Service as a subrogee [2]. The defendants argued that the claim was barred because it was not filed within the 15-day period stipulated in the Management Contract, a condition printed on the "Permit to Deliver Imported Goods" [3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Reliance Surety, ordering the defendants to pay P6,994.57, holding that the consignee was not bound by the Management Contract [4]. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the consignee is bound by the 15-day period to file a claim provided in the Management Contract.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the consignee is not bound by the provisions of the Management Contract limiting the period to file a claim to fifteen days [5].

The Court explained that the rationale for binding consignees to the Management Contract in previous cases was based on their acts of signing the annotation on the delivery permit or gate pass, thereby signifying knowledge and acceptance [6, 7]. In this case, the consignee did not sign any delivery permit or gate pass, either personally or through a broker, because the goods were never withdrawn from the piers [6]. Citing *Sun Bros. & Co. v. Manila Port Service* (G.R. No. L-13500), the Court ruled that where a consignee has no knowledge of the Management Contract and does not make use of a delivery permit to claim the goods, they cannot be bound by the contract's limitations [5, 7].

The decision appealed from is hereby affirmed [5].
