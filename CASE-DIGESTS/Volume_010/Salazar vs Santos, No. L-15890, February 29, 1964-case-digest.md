I. CAPTION
VICENTE SALAZAR v. THE HON. JOSE M. SANTOS, Judge of the Court of Agrarian Relations, LEONARDO STA. ROMANA, GAUDENCIO VALDEZ, TEOFILO TINIO and PEDRO GRANETA, G.R. No. L-15890, February 29, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Vicente Salazar filed a petition in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) against respondent landowner Leonardo Sta. Romana and others, claiming he was a tenant of Sta. Romana’s land in Nueva Ecija from 1941 until his ejectment in 1958. Sta. Romana denied the tenancy relationship.

Salazar relied on a 1951 decision in *CIR Cases Nos. 1647-R-1652-R*, filed by Sta. Romana’s lessee and overseer, Gaudencio Valdez, against Salazar and others. That decision dismissed Valdez’s complaint and declared the respondents therein as lawful tenants. However, Sta. Romana was not a party to that case.

Conversely, in 1954, Salazar had filed *CIR Case No. 1965-NE* against Sta. Romana for liquidation. The court dismissed that case without prejudice for failure to establish tenancy, noting Salazar was not represented by counsel.

In the present case, the CAR dismissed Salazar's petition, finding he was merely a subtenant or helper of his father-in-law and not a tenant of Sta. Romana. The CAR held that the 1951 decision did not bind Sta. Romana and that the 1954 dismissal, while not *res judicata*, was relevant. Salazar appealed, arguing the 1951 decision bound Sta. Romana as Valdez was his privy.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 1951 decision in *CIR Cases Nos. 1647-R-1652-R* recognizing Salazar as a tenant is binding on the landowner Sta. Romana.
2. W/N the 1954 decision in *CIR Case No. 1965-NE* dismissing Salazar's claim without prejudice is relevant to the present case.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A decision in an agricultural tenancy case where the landowner was not made a party cannot bind the latter. Although the 1951 decision impliedly recognized a tenancy relationship between Salazar and the lessee Valdez, it did not bind Sta. Romana because he was not a party and had no occasion to deny or admit the relationship [1]. There was no showing that Sta. Romana had prior knowledge of Valdez's petition acknowledging Salazar as a tenant, and Valdez’s acknowledgment may have been a mistake or error of judgment [2].

2. **YES.** While the 1954 decision dismissing Salazar's claim was without prejudice and thus did not constitute *res judicata*, there is no legal principle preventing the court from regarding it as material and relevant [3]. It served as additional material to enlighten the court, particularly because the evidence presented in both cases was substantially the same [4]. The Court found no reason to disturb the CAR's finding that Salazar failed to prove tenancy and was merely a helper of his father-in-law [5].

Decision affirmed.
