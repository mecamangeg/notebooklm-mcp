I. CAPTION
GODOFREDO QUIMSING v. EDUARDO TAJANGLANGIT, G.R. No. L-19981, February 29, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Quimsing was designated Acting Chief of Police of Iloilo City on May 20, 1960. On December 20, 1961, outgoing President Garcia extended an *ad interim* appointment to him for the same position, and he took his oath on December 28, 1961. On May 16, 1962, the Commission on Appointments (CA) confirmed his appointment. However, the following day, a Senator moved for the reconsideration of all confirmations made the previous day and simultaneously moved that said motion be "laid on the table." The motion was approved, and the session adjourned *sine die*.

Subsequently, on June 11, 1962, President Macapagal designated respondent Tajanglangit as Acting Chief of Police. Tajanglangit argued that Quimsing's appointment was a "midnight appointment" revoked by Administrative Order No. 2 and that the CA confirmation was ineffective due to the motion for reconsideration. Quimsing filed a petition for prohibition to restrain Tajanglangit from occupying the office.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Quimsing's *ad interim* appointment is invalid as a "midnight appointment" under Administrative Order No. 2.
2. W/N the confirmation of Quimsing's appointment was valid despite the motion for reconsideration being "laid on the table."

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that Administrative Order No. 2 was never upheld by the Supreme Court as a blanket revocation. In *Aytona v. Castillo*, the Court did not declare all appointments made after December 13, 1961, invalid per se. The validity depends on the nature, character, and merits of the individual appointment. Quimsing had been serving as Acting Chief since 1960, and his qualifications were not in dispute. His appointment was not part of the "hurried designations" or the "scramble" that characterized the invalid midnight appointments in *Aytona*.

2. **YES.** Under Section 21 of the Revised Rules of the Commission on Appointments, the "laying on the table" of a motion for reconsideration constitutes a "final disposition" of the motion. Consequently, it is as if no motion for reconsideration was filed at all. Furthermore, the CA delivered the notice of confirmation to Malacañang on July 19, 1962, which serves as a recognition that the appointment was indeed confirmed.

The petition is GRANTED. The appointment of respondent Tajanglangit is declared null and void.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Dissenting (Padilla, J.):**
Argued that the *ad interim* appointment expired on December 30, 1961, when the appointing President's term ended. Thus, the confirmation in May 1962 was of no legal effect as he was not reappointed.
