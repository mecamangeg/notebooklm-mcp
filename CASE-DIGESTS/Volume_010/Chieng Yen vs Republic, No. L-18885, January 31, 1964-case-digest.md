I. CAPTION
CHIENG YEN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18885, January 31, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Chieng Yen, a Chinese citizen who has resided in the Philippines since 1935, filed a petition for naturalization on September 16, 1958, in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [1, 2]. He claimed to have transferred his residence from Olongapo, Zambales, to Manila in February 1955 [3]. However, his business activities—consisting of a restaurant, nightclub, and furniture store—were all located in Olongapo, where his school-age children also attended public school [3, 4]. The CFI denied the petition on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, finding that the petitioner was not a resident of Manila for at least one year prior to the filing of the petition [1]. Petitioner appealed, presenting witnesses and an alien registration certificate issued in 1959 to prove his alleged transfer of residence in 1955 [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance of Manila had jurisdiction over the petition based on the petitioner's residence.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Supreme Court affirmed the denial of the petition [6]. The Court ruled that legal residence imports not only the intention to reside in a fixed place but also personal presence in that place, coupled with conduct indicative of such intention (citing *Nuval v. Guray*) [7]. In this case, the fact that the petitioner had no business in Manila and had to attend to his businesses in Olongapo was a potent reason to disbelieve his claim of transfer [7]. The Court took judicial notice that Chinese businessmen rarely reside in a place different from where they have their place of business (*Ong v. Republic*) [7]. The purpose of the one-year residence requirement is to facilitate the determination by authorities of the petitioner's activities and qualifications [7]. Furthermore, the petitioner failed to state some of his former places of residence, which in itself is a sufficient disqualification (*Keng Giok v. Republic*) [8]. Consequently, the CFI of Manila was bereft of jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case [8].

Decision affirmed [6].
