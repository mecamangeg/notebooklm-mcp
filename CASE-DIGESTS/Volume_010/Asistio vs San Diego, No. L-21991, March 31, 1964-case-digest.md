I. CAPTION
LUIS ASISTIO, ET AL. v. HON. LOURDES P. SAN DIEGO, G.R. No. L-21991, March 31, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Luis Asistio and others were charged with kidnapping for ransom under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) for the abduction of Chua Pao on December 26, 1962, with a demand for P20,000. Petitioners applied for bail, arguing that the victim was voluntarily released within 24 hours without any ransom being paid. They contended that under the last paragraph of Article 268 (Slight Illegal Detention), these circumstances reduced the penalty to *prisión mayor*, making the crime non-capital and bailable. The respondent Judge denied the application, ruling that the evidence of guilt was strong for the capital offense charged. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari and habeas corpus with the Supreme Court to set aside the order denying bail.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the penalty for kidnapping for ransom under Article 267 is reduced by the circumstances of voluntary release and non-attainment of purpose provided in the last paragraph of Article 268.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the death penalty prescribed for kidnapping for ransom is not reduced by the voluntary release of the victim or the non-attainment of the purpose. A review of the legislative history reveals that Article 267 (Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention) and Article 268 (Slight Illegal Detention) are independent and mutually exclusive. The mitigating circumstances in the last paragraph of Article 268 existed in the original Penal Code and were intended only for slight illegal detention. When the legislature enacted Republic Act No. 18 and Republic Act No. 1084 to impose the death penalty for kidnapping for ransom, it did not indicate any intent to apply the mitigating provisions of Article 268 to Article 267. Furthermore, it is irrational to hold that these circumstances should reduce the penalty for the capital offense in Article 267 by three degrees (to *prisión mayor*), when they only reduce the lesser penalty in Article 268 by one degree.

The petition was **DENIED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Bautista Angelo, J.** (Dissenting): He voted to grant bail, arguing that the failure to apply the mitigating provision of Article 268 to Article 267 was a legislative oversight. He reasoned that penal laws should be resolved in favor of the accused and that offering a lower penalty encourages kidnappers to release victims unharmed.
