I. CAPTION
VIGAN ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY, INC. v. THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-19850, January 30, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Vigan Electric Light Company, Inc. operates an electric light, heat, and power service in Ilocos Sur under a legislative franchise and a certificate of public convenience issued by the respondent Public Service Commission (PSC) [1]. In January 1962, the PSC advised the petitioner of a conference to revise its rates, following a letter-petition from a Congressman alleging black market sales of meters and excessive rates [2, 3]. The PSC subsequently ordered the General Auditing Office (GAO) to audit the petitioner's books [4].

While conferences were pending and a motion to quash a *subpoena duces tecum* was unresolved, the PSC issued an order on May 17, 1962, reducing the petitioner's rates by approximately 18% [5, 6]. This order was based solely on the GAO report finding that the petitioner was earning a net operating income of 45.45% on invested capital, well above the 12% allowable return [6, 7]. The petitioner filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that the order was issued without notice and hearing, thereby violating due process, as the order was based on a factual report they were not given a chance to refute [8]. The PSC contended that rate-fixing is a legislative function that does not require previous notice and hearing [9, 10].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission can validly reduce the rates of a particular public utility without prior notice and hearing.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the order is null and void for violation of the due process clause [11, 12].

While the Court acknowledged that rule-making and rate-fixing can be legislative in character when they apply to *all* enterprises of a given kind *throughout* the Philippines [13-15], the order in question applied *exclusively* to the petitioner and was predicated on a specific finding of fact (the GAO report) which the petitioner denied [15-17]. Consequently, the PSC performed a function partaking of a **quasi-judicial** character, the valid exercise of which demands previous notice and hearing [16, 18].

The Court cited Sections 16(c) and 20(a) of Commonwealth Act No. 146 (Public Service Act), which explicitly require "proper notice and hearing" for fixing rates [18, 19]. Since the factual basis of the reduction was assailed by the petitioner, they were entitled to cross-examine the makers of the report and introduce evidence to disprove it [15]. Citing American Jurisprudence, the Court held that where proceedings are determinative and affect specific persons, a public utility must be afforded an opportunity to be heard regarding the reasonableness of rates [20].

The petition was granted, and the preliminary injunction against the PSC order was made permanent [21].
