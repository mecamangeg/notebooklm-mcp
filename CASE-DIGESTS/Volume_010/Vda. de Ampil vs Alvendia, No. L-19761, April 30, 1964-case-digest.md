I. CAPTION
QUINTINA S. VDA. DE AMPIL and DOMINGO BROTHERS, INC. v. THE HON. JUDGE CARMELINO G. ALVENDIA and VICENTE MANUEL, G.R. No. L-19761, April 30, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Vda. de Ampil and Domingo Brothers, Inc. obtained a favorable judgment in an ejectment case against respondent Vicente Manuel in the Municipal Court. The decision ordered Manuel to vacate the premises and pay monthly rent of P70.00 "within the first five (5) days of each month" [1, 2]. Manuel appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI). Pending appeal, petitioners moved for execution, alleging Manuel failed to deposit the rentals within the first five days as stated in the decision [3]. Respondent Judge Alvendia denied the motion, finding that Manuel made deposits "within the first ten days" of the month, which was sufficient compliance [4]. Petitioners sought a writ to compel execution, arguing the five-day period in the Municipal Court judgment was controlling [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent lessee must deposit current rentals within the first five days of the month pending appeal as stated in the Municipal Court judgment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the petition [6]. The Court ruled that under Section 8, Rule 72 of the Rules of Court, the lessee must deposit rent "as found by the judgment... to exist, or in the absence of contract... on or before the tenth day of each calendar month" [7]. The phrase "in the absence of contract" covers situations where the judgment does not make specific findings regarding the terms of the contract [8].

In this case, although the dispositive portion of the Municipal Court decision ordered payment within the first five days, the body of the decision contained no specific finding that the lease contract required payment within that period [4, 9]. Citing *Yu Phi Khim v. Teng Giok Yan*, the Court held that where the judgment does not specifically declare the contract's time for payment, the ten-day period provided by the Rules applies [9]. Since the respondent deposited the rentals within the first ten days, execution pending appeal was not warranted [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
