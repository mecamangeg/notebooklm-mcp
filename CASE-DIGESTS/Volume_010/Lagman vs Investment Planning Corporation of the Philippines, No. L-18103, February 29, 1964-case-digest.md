I. CAPTION
OSCAR LAGMAN and ROBERTO ANGELES v. INVESTMENT PLANNING CORPORATION OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18103, February 29, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Oscar Lagman won the first prize in a contest conducted by the defendant, which included two round-trip tickets to Hong Kong and a seven-day hotel stay [1]. Claiming the defendant failed to fully comply with the prize terms—specifically regarding the sufficiency of funds for tickets and accommodation which prevented him from bringing his companion, co-plaintiff Roberto Angeles—Lagman filed a suit for the collection of the unpaid balance [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Lagman, ordering the defendant to pay P982.00 plus P400.00 in attorney's fees [3]. The defendant appealed directly to the Supreme Court, explicitly stating in its brief that it was appealing "on questions of law and of fact" [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that it did not have jurisdiction to decide the appeal. The Court explained that an appeal from the Court of First Instance in a civil case must be brought to the Court of Appeals, not the Supreme Court, when the amount involved does not exceed P200,000.00 and the appeal involves questions of both law and of fact [4, 5]. In this case, the amount in controversy was well below the jurisdictional threshold, and the defendant-appellant expressly raised questions of both law and fact [3].

Accordingly, the case was remanded to the Court of Appeals for proper disposition [3, 6].
