I. CAPTION
NICANOR G. JORGE v. JOVENCIO Q. MAYOR, G.R. No. L-21776, February 28, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Nicanor Jorge was a career official in the Bureau of Lands with 38 years of service [1]. On December 13, 1961, outgoing President Garcia extended him an *ad interim* appointment as Director of Lands, which was confirmed by the Commission on Appointments on May 14, 1962 [1]. However, in November 1962, the Macapagal administration informed Jorge that his appointment was revoked by Administrative Order (AO) No. 2, which withdrew "midnight appointments" made by the previous president [2]. Respondent Jovencio Mayor was designated as Acting Director in his stead [2]. Jorge protested but remained courteous to avoid obstructing office functions [2], [3]. Respondent argued the appointment was invalid under the *Aytona* ruling and that Jorge had voluntarily abandoned his office [4]. Jorge filed a petition for mandamus and *quo warranto* directly with the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Administrative Order No. 2 validly revoked petitioner’s *ad interim* appointment.
2. W/N the petitioner abandoned his office.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that Administrative Order No. 2 did not revoke the appointment. The Order only covered appointments made and released *after* the joint session of Congress ended on December 13, 1961 [6]. Although Jorge’s appointment was dated December 13, there was no evidence it was made after the session ended late that night; the presumption of regularity suggests it was made during office hours [7]. Furthermore, the Court distinguished this from *Aytona v. Castillo*, ruling that *ad interim* appointments of career officials like Jorge, which are "so spaced as to afford some assurance of deliberate action," do not constitute prohibited "midnight appointments" [8], [9]. The constitutional protection against removal without cause applies to career civil servants who rise through merit [9].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that Jorge did not abandon his office. His lack of hostile attitude towards the respondent was merely an expression of "delicadeza" and courtesy expected of a high official, not an intention to relinquish his rights [3]. Valid abandonment requires a voluntary and deliberate choice to renounce the office, which was absent as Jorge explicitly protested his demotion [3].

Petition **GRANTED**. Respondent is required to turn over the office to petitioner [10].
