I. CAPTION
**INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE LATE MARIA DE LA CRUZ, MARGARITA DE LA CRUZ v. PLARIDEL SURETY & INSURANCE CO.**, G.R. No. L-16483, April 30, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In the intestate proceedings of Maria de la Cruz, appellee Margarita de la Cruz filed a motion on April 28, 1957, to compel appellant Plaridel Surety & Insurance Co. (surety for former administrator Teodorico Adsuara) to pay Adsuara's liability of P2,413.00 [1]. On April 29, 1957, the lower court denied the motion, ruling it was "not the proper remedy" [1]. Appellee did not appeal this denial. Instead, seven months later on November 28, 1957, she filed a motion for reconsideration [2], [3]. The lower court subsequently issued an order on February 28, 1958, reconsidering the April 29 order and resetting the matter for hearing [4]. Plaridel Surety appealed, arguing the April 29 order had already become final and executory [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court could validly reconsider its order dated April 29, 1957, despite the lapse of seven months.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the lower court committed reversible error in issuing the order of February 28, 1958 [6]. The Court explained that the initial order of April 29, 1957, which denied the motion to require the surety to pay, was **final in character** and not merely interlocutory [5]. An order is final if it puts an end to the litigation regarding a specific issue, whereas an interlocutory order leaves something to be done on the merits [5]. Since the April 29 order was a final disposition of the matter involved in the motion, the appellee's proper remedy was to appeal [5], [3]. Because the appellee failed to appeal and allowed seven months to elapse before filing for reconsideration, the order became **final and executory** [3]. Once an order becomes final and executory, it may no longer be reconsidered by the lower court [7], [6].

The order appealed from is set aside [6].
