I. CAPTION
BENIGNO MALINAO v. LUZON SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-16082, February 29, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On May 11, 1948, Escudero and Co., Inc. sued Benigno Malinao and Luzon Surety Co., Inc. (Surety) for the recovery of P23,748.28 representing the value of goods sold on credit to Malinao. The Surety was impleaded due to a bond guaranteeing Malinao's compliance. In 1958, Malinao sought to file a cross-claim against the Surety, alleging that the Surety took possession of his hardware store and accounts receivable worth P60,576.00 to pay the obligation, but failed to return the excess balance of P58,776.00.

The trial court initially struck out the cross-claim for lack of permission on June 20, 1957, and denied a subsequent motion for leave to file on September 12, 1957. However, upon Malinao’s motion for reconsideration filed in 1958, the trial court reversed itself and admitted the cross-claim. The Surety filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA set aside the trial court's order, ruling that the cross-claim was improper as it did not arise from the subject matter of the original complaint. Malinao appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the cross-claim filed by Malinao against Luzon Surety Co., Inc. was proper.
2. W/N certiorari was the proper remedy for the Surety to question the admission of the cross-claim.
3. W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in admitting the cross-claim.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A cross-claim is not proper if it does not arise out of the transaction that is the subject matter of the original action. Under Section 2, Rule 10 of the Rules of Court, a cross-claim is "any claim by one party against a co-party arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter either of the original action or of a counterclaim therein." Here, the original action involved the sale of goods from Escudero to Malinao. Malinao’s cross-claim involved a separate agreement where the Surety took management of his store. The Court held that the transaction between the Surety and Malinao did not arise out of the transaction between Escudero and Malinao [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The Court held that while an appeal was available, it was not a speedy and adequate remedy. The Surety would have been forced to wait for judgment in both the original action and the cross-claim before obtaining relief. In such cases, certiorari is the adequate remedy to promptly relieve the petitioner from the injurious effects of the lower court's order. The Court cited *Silvestre vs. Torres and Oben* (57 Phil. 885) regarding the availability of certiorari when appeal is insufficient [3, 4].

3. **YES.** The trial court's earlier orders denying the cross-claim (dated June 20, 1957, and September 12, 1957) were final orders, as they disposed of the motion and left nothing else to be done. Malinao failed to appeal these orders or file a motion under Rule 38. By disregarding the finality of these previous orders and subsequently allowing the cross-claim in 1958, the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion [5].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED** [6].
