I. CAPTION
UNITED STATES LINES COMPANY v. SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC., G.R. No. L-19383, April 30, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner United States Lines Company, a foreign corporation, operated the vessel S/S "Peter J. McGuire." On November 1, 1951, the vessel's refrigeration facilities failed while in Manila Bay. Petitioner leased Compartment A in Room I-B of the Insular Ice and Cold Storage Plant, operated by Respondent San Miguel Brewery, Inc., to store the vessel's perishable provisions [1, 2]. The foodstuffs were stored until November 6, 1951. Upon withdrawal, the provisions were found gnawed by rats and contaminated with excreta [2]. The Bureau of Quarantine condemned the goods as unfit for consumption. Subsequently, government employees caught 66 rats in the storage room between November 19 and December 15, 1951 [2].

Petitioner sued for damages. The Court of First Instance (CFI) ruled in favor of the Petitioner [3, 4]. However, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the decision, ruling that a lessor is not liable for damages caused by defects in the leased premises unless there was fraud or bad faith, citing *Yap Kim Chuan v. Tiaoqui* [3, 5]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lessor is liable for damages to the stored goods caused by rats in the leased cold storage plant.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that in a contract of lease of a cold storage plant, the lessor is understood to warrant that the premises would be free from rats [6, 7]. Under **Article 1653** of the Civil Code, the provisions governing warranty in Sales are applicable to Lease [7]. Furthermore, **Article 1566** of the Civil Code holds the vendor (and by extension, the lessor) responsible for hidden faults or defects in the thing sold/leased, even if they were not aware of them [8].

The Court clarified that the CA's reliance on *Yap Kim Chuan v. Tiaoqui* was erroneous because that case involved *force majeure* (torrential rain), whereas the current case involves a defect inherent to the facility [5]. The fact that 66 rats were caught shortly after the goods were removed, with no evidence they entered later, led the Court to conclude the infestation existed during the lease [9].

The decision of the Court of Appeals was set aside, and the decision of the Court of First Instance was affirmed [4].
