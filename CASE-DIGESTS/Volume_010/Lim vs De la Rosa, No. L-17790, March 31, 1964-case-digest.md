I. CAPTION
LORENZO LIM and JUANA ALVAREZ LIM v. FRANCISCO DE LA ROSA, as Asst. Commissioner of Immigration, and JOVITO PALATTAO, as Alien Control Officer, G.R. No. L-17790, March 31, 1964, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents, the Assistant Commissioner of Immigration and the Alien Control Officer of Zamboanga City, ordered petitioner Lorenzo Lim to register as an alien [1, 2]. This order relied on Department of Justice (DOJ) opinions stating Lim was not a Filipino citizen [3]. Lim and his wife filed a petition for injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, claiming he is a Filipino citizen [4]. Lim presented evidence that he is the illegitimate son of a Chinese father and a Filipino mother (Mora Alsia), and thus followed his mother's citizenship [5]. He also showed proof of electing citizenship in 1941, voting in various elections since 1928, and possessing a Filipino passport [6]. The CFI ruled in Lim's favor, declaring him a Filipino citizen and permanently enjoining the respondents from compelling him to register. Respondents appealed, questioning the remedy of injunction and the finding of citizenship [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N injunction is the proper remedy to prevent the government from requiring a person claiming to be a citizen to register as an alien.
2. W/N the DOJ opinions declaring the petitioner an alien are conclusive.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that if a person claiming to be a citizen is being required or compelled to register as an alien by administrative officers, and can "show, establish, or prove that he is such citizen," the remedy of injunction is "certainly the proper and adequate remedy to protect his right" [9].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the DOJ opinions invoked by the respondents "do not have a conclusive character or effect" on the petitioner's citizenship [10]. The Court noted these opinions were based on previous findings that the evidence then submitted was unsupported [10]. In this case, the lower court's findings were supported by documents and testimony establishing that Lim was an illegitimate child of a Filipino mother and had consistently acted as a Filipino citizen (voting, holding a passport) [5, 6].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [10].
