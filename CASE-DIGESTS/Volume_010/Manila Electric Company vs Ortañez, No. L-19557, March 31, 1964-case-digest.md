I. CAPTION
MANILA ELECTRIC COMPANY v. PASCUAL ORTAÑEZ, FRANCISCO P. GENEROSO, COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19557, March 31, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Pascual Ortañez et al. filed a case against petitioner Manila Electric Company (Meralco) in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to compel the payment of overtime wages and night premium pay earned since 1956 [1]. Respondents alleged that Meralco granted these benefits to all other employees under a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) but refused to pay them, thereby violating Commonwealth Act No. 444 (Eight-Hour Labor Law) [2, 3]. Meralco moved to dismiss, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction because the case involved fewer than 30 employees, citing Section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 103 [3]. The CIR denied the motion to dismiss, asserting its authority to enforce labor laws [3]. Meralco subsequently filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction to hear the case based on the allegations in the petition.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the CIR has jurisdiction to proceed with the case. The petition filed below was in the nature of *mandamus* to compel compliance with the Eight-Hour Labor Law and involved allegations that the CBA was applied in a discriminatory manner, which could amount to an unfair labor practice [4, 5]. The Court explained that while the interpretation of a contract is generally for the regular courts, the CIR retains jurisdiction if the agreement was made under its supervision or if its application involves unfair labor practices [5]. Ultimately, whether the CIR has jurisdiction depends on the actual facts proved at trial, not just the complaint's allegations [6]. Applying the rule that a case should not be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action in case of doubt, the Court allowed the CIR to hear the case until facts might prove it falls outside its jurisdiction [6].

The petition for certiorari and prohibition is **DENIED** [7].
