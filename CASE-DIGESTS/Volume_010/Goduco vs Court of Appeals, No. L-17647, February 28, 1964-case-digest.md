**I. CAPTION**
HERMINIA GODUCO v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and MARIA B. CASTRO, G.R. No. L-17647, February 28, 1964, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Herminia Goduco filed a complaint for recovery of money against Respondent Maria B. Castro. Goduco alleged that she facilitated the sale of a piece of land in Parañaque to Castro for P150,000.00 [1]. Goduco claimed that although the deed of sale was executed in the name of Sostenes Campillo, the true buyer was Castro, and Campillo was merely a dummy [1]. She further alleged that Castro deducted the P7,500.00 commission from the purchase price but refused to pay it to her [1]. Castro denied the allegations, asserting she did not buy the property and that Campillo, the lessee of her hotel, was the actual purchaser [2]. Castro argued that even if Goduco was authorized to sell, the claim for commission should be directed against the owner/seller who promised it, not the buyer [3].

The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint [4]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the dismissal, finding the evidence insufficient to prove Castro was the real buyer or that she deducted the commission [4, 5]. The CA held that the deed of sale named Campillo, and Goduco's testimony regarding the deduction of commission was hearsay [6]. Goduco appealed to the Supreme Court, urging a review of the facts to declare Campillo a dummy [7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Supreme Court can review the factual findings of the Court of Appeals regarding the identity of the buyer.
2. W/N the buyer is liable for the agent's commission.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** In appeals from the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court, only questions of law are subject to review [7]. A question of law does not call for an examination of the probative value of evidence. The CA's factual finding that Sostenes Campillo was the real purchaser and financially capable of buying the property is binding on the Supreme Court [8]. Goduco's claim that Campillo was a dummy rested largely on surmise and conjecture and was not supported by evidence [8, 9].

2. **NO.** Granting *arguendo* that Goduco had the authority to sell the property, this does not make the buyer liable for the commission [8]. The Court ruled that the owner of the property and the person who promised the commission are the ones liable to pay it, and the claim should be directed at them [8]. Even if the buyer (Castro) had deducted the commission from the purchase price as alleged, the cause of action would still lie against the person who promised to pay the commission but allowed it to be given to another [8, 9].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
