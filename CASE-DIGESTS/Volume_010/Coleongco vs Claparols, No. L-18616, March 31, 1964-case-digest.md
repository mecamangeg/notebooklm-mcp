I. CAPTION
VICENTE M. COLEONGCO v. EDUARDO L. CLAPAROLS, G.R. No. L-18616, March 31, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Since 1951, Respondent Eduardo Claparols operated a nail factory in Negros Occidental. Due to losses, he entered into a financing agreement (Exhibit "B") in 1953 with Petitioner Vicente Coleongco. Under the agreement, Coleongco would finance raw material imports and handle marketing and cash, while Claparols would manufacture the nails; profits and losses were to be shared on a 50-50 basis [1], [2]. Claparols subsequently executed a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) in favor of Coleongco to handle banking and business transactions, and Coleongco became the assistant manager [3].

In 1956, Claparols was surprised by a writ of execution from the Philippine National Bank (PNB) despite having an amortization plan. He discovered that Coleongco had written derogatory letters to the bank, undermining Claparols' credit in an attempt to acquire the factory for himself [4], [5]. Coleongco also corresponded with Kho To, a dealer, outlining plans to "squeeze" Claparols out of the business [6], [7]. Consequently, Claparols revoked the SPA and demanded an accounting, which revealed Coleongco owed the factory over P80,000 [8], [6].

Coleongco filed a suit for breach of contract and damages. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental dismissed the complaint and ordered Coleongco to pay Claparols P81,387.27 plus P50,000 in moral and compensatory damages [9]. Coleongco appealed, arguing the SPA was coupled with an interest and therefore irrevocable [10].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the power of attorney coupled with interest was validly revoked by Claparols due to the agent's bad faith.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that a power of attorney, even if coupled with an interest, may be revoked for a just cause.

While a power of attorney coupled with an interest is generally irrevocable, this irrevocability cannot be used to shield the agent's perpetration of acts in bad faith, breach of confidence, or betrayal of trust [11]. The Court likened the situation to Article 1800 of the Civil Code regarding partnerships, where a manager's power is irrevocable only "without just or lawful cause" [12]. Additionally, Article 1172 prescribes that responsibility arising from fraud is demandable in all obligations [12].

The Court found that Coleongco's letters to PNB and his attempt to sabotage the factory constituted plain acts of betrayal and bad faith, justifying the revocation of the SPA [13]. Furthermore, the award of damages was sustained under Article 2232 of the Civil Code due to the malevolence behind Coleongco's actions [14].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**. Costs against appellant Vicente Coleongco [14].
