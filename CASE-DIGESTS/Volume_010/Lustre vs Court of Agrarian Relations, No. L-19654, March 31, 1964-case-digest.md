I. CAPTION
EMILIANO LUSTRE and FELIPE N. LUSTRE v. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, PAULINO GUTIERREZ and BENJAMIN GARCIA, G.R. No. L-19654, March 31, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Gutierrez and Garcia were share tenants on a 50-50 basis on land originally owned by Dominador Arambulo [1]. The land was sold and subsequently leased to petitioner Atty. Felipe Lustre, with petitioner Emiliano Lustre acting as manager. In April 1959, petitioners began plowing the land with a tractor and refused to recognize respondents' status as tenants, effectively ejecting them [1]. The Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) found the ejectment unlawful, ordered reinstatement, and awarded damages based on the harvest immediately preceding the ejectment [2], [3]. Petitioners appealed, arguing that the existence of mechanical farming precluded tenancy, that damages should be based on the harvest *during* the dispossession, and that the tenants' income earned elsewhere should be deducted from the award [4], [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations may base the damages award on the harvest immediately preceding the unlawful ejectment.
2. W/N the tenants' earnings during the period of unlawful ejectment should be deducted from the damages award.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of Agrarian Relations enjoys discretion in selecting the year of tenure that serves as the basis for the award, as long as the harvest for that year is not abnormal [5]. It was proper to use the preceding harvest because requiring a dispossessed tenant to prove the harvest during their absence is unreasonable; the landlord could simply leave the land uncultivated during the ejectment period to block the tenant's claim for damages [6].

2. **NO.** Under Section 27(1) of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended, the landholder is liable for damages to the extent of their participation in the harvest *in addition to* the tenant's right under Section 22 to work elsewhere [3], [7]. While previous jurisprudence under Act 4054 allowed for the deduction of outside earnings based on equity (*Potenciano v. Estefani*), R.A. 1199 explicitly makes the right to work elsewhere an additional right to the recovery of damages, meaning such earnings are no longer deductible [7], [8].

Decision affirmed [9].
