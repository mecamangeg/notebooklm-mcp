**I. CAPTION**
JUAN N. EVANGELISTA and TEODORO EVANGELISTA v. HON. LUIS B. REYES and RENATO B. CABRAL, G.R. No. L-20416, January 30, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondents Spouses Cabral filed a complaint for "Foreclosure of Chattel Mortgage" in the Municipal Court of Manila against George Tunaya and petitioners Spouses Evangelista. They sought the payment of P1,000.00 or the delivery of mortgaged properties for auction. The petitioners were included as they had previously purchased the subject properties at an execution sale. The Municipal Court rendered judgment against Tunaya by confession but dismissed the case against the petitioners.

Respondents Cabral appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. Petitioners initially moved to dismiss the appeal, which was denied. Consequently, petitioners filed an answer in the CFI pleading prescription and a counterclaim. Later, petitioners moved to remand the case to the inferior court citing Section 10, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court. The respondent Judge denied the motion to remand. Petitioners filed a special civil action for certiorari and prohibition, arguing the CFI lacked jurisdiction to hear the case on the merits.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance acquired jurisdiction to try the case on the merits despite the motion to remand.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that by filing an answer in the Court of First Instance, where the case lay on appeal, the petitioners deemed withdrawn their objections to the court taking cognizance of the case pursuant to its original jurisdiction. This is expressly authorized by the last portion of Section 11, Rule 40, which states that instead of dismissing the case, the CFI may try it on the merits if the parties file pleadings without objection. Once the petitioners assented to the court's jurisdiction by filing their answer, they could not later alter their position to insist on a remand.

Furthermore, the petitioners' argument that the amount involved (P1,000.00) was below the CFI's jurisdictional minimum was untenable. The complaint also sought the recovery of possession of mortgaged chattels, and petitioners failed to show that the value of these properties fell outside the original jurisdiction of the CFI.

The writs applied for were denied.
