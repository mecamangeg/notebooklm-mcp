I. CAPTION
PAN AMERICAN WORLD AIRWAYS v. PAA EMPLOYEES' ASSOCIATION (PTGWO) and THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-18345, January 30, 1964, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On March 17, 1960, Petitioner Pan American World Airways and Respondent PAA Employees' Association entered into a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Article 6(d) of the CBA stipulated that if, during the term of the agreement, "a law diminishing the value of Philippine Currency is enacted" and the Company is consequently authorized to increase its rates, either party may reopen the agreement for wage negotiations [1].

In 1960, the Central Bank of the Philippines, pursuant to Republic Act No. 2609, fixed the exchange rate at P3.20 to $1.00 and authorized airlines to sell tickets at said rate [2, 3]. The Union requested renegotiation of wages, arguing the condition was met. Petitioner initially agreed but negotiations failed, leading to a strike [4]. The dispute was certified to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), which ordered the parties to negotiate on wages [5]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that no law was "enacted by Congress" that specifically diminished the currency, thus the CBA condition was not met [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Central Bank's fixing of the exchange rate pursuant to R.A. 2609 constitutes a "law diminishing the value of Philippine Currency" as stipulated in the CBA, justifying wage renegotiation.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the purchasing power or value of money cannot be created merely by a law enacted by the legislative department [3]. When the parties stipulated a "law... enacted," they did not literally mean a specific Act of Congress diminishing value, but rather the reality of a decrease in value confirmed by government action. Republic Act No. 2609 authorized the Central Bank to fix exchange margins [3]. The Central Bank's subsequent act of fixing the peso-dollar rate at P3.20 to $1.00 amounts to a law diminishing the value of the currency for the purposes of the agreement [3]. Rigid adherence to the letter of the contract was not the intent of the parties; rather, they intended to adjust wages if the currency's value dropped and the company's rates increased [3]. Although the CBA term had expired making the case moot, the appeal is dismissed [7].
