I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, KWAN KWOCK HOW v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-18521, January 30, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Kwan Kwock How filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Tarlac. Attached to his petition were the joint affidavits of two witnesses, Telesforo G. Espinosa and Justito M. Lenon, who stated they had known the petitioner since childhood to be a "hardworking, law-abiding, God-fearing person" and a "credit to the community" [1]. During the trial, it was shown that the petitioner was baptized as "Alipio Koan," but this name was not included in his petition or the published notices [2].

The CFI granted the petition. The Republic appealed, arguing that the affidavits were insufficient and that the allegations in the petition were defective [3]. The petitioner admitted the deficiencies but contended that the Republic could not raise these objections for the first time on appeal [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the government can raise objections to the petition's sufficiency for the first time on appeal.
2. W/N the affidavits of the supporting witnesses complied with the requirements of the Naturalization Law.
3. W/N the failure to include the petitioner's baptismal name in the petition and publication is a fatal defect.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The defense that objections were not raised in the lower court is unavailable in naturalization cases. Naturalization involves public interest; thus, on appeal, the entire record is open to scrutiny whether an objection was made or not. The burden is on the applicant to show strict compliance with the law [4].

2. **NO.** The affidavits were insufficient. Section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 requires witnesses to attest that the petitioner is of "good repute" and "morally irreproachable," and that he possesses all qualifications and no disqualifications [5, 6]. The witnesses' descriptions of the petitioner as merely "hardworking" and "law-abiding" are not equivalent to "morally irreproachable" [7]. Furthermore, the affidavits failed to affirmatively endorse that the petitioner had all the requisite qualifications and none of the disqualifications, rendering the petition void (*Ong v. Republic*) [6, 8].

3. **YES.** The omission of the baptismal name "Alipio Koan" in the petition and published notices is a fatal defect [2]. The purpose of publication is to apprise the public so that those who know of any legal objection may come forward. Persons with derogatory information against "Alipio Koan" might not come forward if they believe the applicant "Kwan Kwock How" is a different person (*Yu Seco v. Republic*) [2].

**ACCORDINGLY**, the decision appealed from is reversed, and the application is dismissed [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred. Justice Barrera took no part [9, 10].)
