I. CAPTION
LUZON BROKERAGE COMPANY v. LUZON LABOR UNION, G.R. No. L-17085, March 31, 1964, 10 SCRA 511, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Union claimants sought back wages from petitioner Luzon Brokerage Company for the period they served in Bataan during World War II. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), in a 1959 decision following a remand, granted back pay for a period of two to three years. The CIR based this finding on conflicting testimonies, deciding to give the claimants the "benefit of the doubt."

In a resolution dated October 31, 1963, the Supreme Court modified this award, limiting the back wages to the specific period from December 8, 1941, to June 8, 1942. The respondent Union filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the CIR's finding of fact regarding the "two to three years" duration had already been affirmed in the Supreme Court's earlier decision (January 31, 1963) and resolution (July 31, 1963), and thus should not have been reviewed or modified. Claimants also sought incidental expenses incurred during the war and unpaid wages prior to December 1941.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court can review the CIR's finding of fact regarding the duration of back pay in a Motion for Reconsideration when it was not reviewed in the original decision.
2. W/N the claimants are entitled to incidental expenses incurred during war operations in Bataan.
3. W/N the claim for back wages includes unpaid salaries prior to the declaration of war on December 8, 1941.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that findings of fact by the CIR, which were not reviewed in the original Supreme Court decision nor in the subsequent resolution, may still be the subject of a motion for reconsideration. The Court noted that its previous affirmance assumed the correctness of the CIR's finding without actual review. Upon review, the Court found the CIR's "two to three years" award was based merely on doubt rather than established proof. Thus, the Court properly modified the award to the actual period of service: December 8, 1941, to June 8, 1942 [1-3].

2. **NO.** All incidental expenses spent by the claimants while in war operations cannot be granted because there was no agreement that such expenses were to be charged against the company. Furthermore, the claimants had already received both their back pay from the company and their wages from the United States Army for that period [2, 4].

3. **NO.** The subject of the suit is strictly back wages for the time the claimants went to Bataan during the war. This cannot include supposed unpaid wages accrued before the claimants went to Bataan (prior to December 8, 1941). Such claims must be the subject of a separate suit [4-6].

Motion denied.
