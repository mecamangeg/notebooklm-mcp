I. CAPTION
THE CITY OF MANILA and THE CITY ASSESSOR OF MANILA v. THE BOARD OF ASSESSMENT APPEALS, PABLO DAÑO, and JULITA AQUINO, G.R. No. L-18784, April 30, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
The City Assessor of Manila increased the real estate tax assessment of a property owned by Spouses Daño and Aquino from P20.00 to P30.00 per square meter [1]. The spouses appealed to the City Board of Assessment Appeals, which disapproved the increase [1]. The City of Manila and the City Assessor filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [1]. The Board moved to dismiss the petition, arguing the City Assessor had no legal personality to appeal its decision [1]. The CTA granted the motion and dismissed the petition [1]. The petitioners then appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City Assessor of Manila has the personality to appeal a decision of the City Board of Assessment Appeals to the CTA.
2. W/N the City of Manila has the personality to appeal a decision of the City Board of Assessment Appeals to the CTA.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court affirmed the lower court's resolution regarding the City Assessor, citing settled jurisprudence in *Ursal vs. Court of Tax Appeals* which established that the City Assessor cannot appeal a decision of the City Board of Assessment Appeals to the Court of Tax Appeals [2].

2. **YES.** Under Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125, any person, association, or corporation "adversely affected" by a decision of the City Board of Assessment Appeals may appeal to the CTA [3]. The City of Manila is a corporation adversely affected by the decision because, under Section 78 of its Revised Charter (R.A. No. 409), one-fourth of real estate taxes are exclusively devoted to the support of public schools [3, 4]. The reduction in assessment directly reduces the funds available for the City's schools [4, 5]. The Court clarified that previous rulings prohibiting government appeals applied to subordinate officials appealing against superiors, which is not the case here [6].

The resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings [4].
