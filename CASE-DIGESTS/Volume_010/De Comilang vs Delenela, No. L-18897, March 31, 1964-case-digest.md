I. CAPTION
MAXIMA NIETO DE COMILANG v. ABDON DELENELA, GUILLERMO PEREZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18897, March 31, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Marcos Comilang, husband of petitioner Maxima Nieto de Comilang, held rights to the "Bua Mineral Claim" and surface rights to 1-1/2 hectares of residential land in Tuding, Itogon, Benguet [1]. On June 1, 1957, pursuant to a writ of execution for a judgment debt, the Sheriff sold Marcos's rights to the residential land (declared under Tax Declaration No. 4771) at public auction to the Coloma spouses [1]. Subsequently, respondents Delenela and Perez, with Marcos’s consent, redeemed the property from the Coloma spouses [1, 2].

On August 12, 1959, the Municipal Judge of Baguio City issued a writ of possession directing the Sheriff to place respondents in possession of the property [2, 3]. Petitioner filed an action for certiorari and injunction to annul the order, arguing that: (1) the property is conjugal and cannot be levied upon for the husband's debt without her consent; and (2) surface rights cannot be severed from mineral rights under the Philippine Bill of 1902 [2]. The Court of First Instance of Baguio denied the petition, ruling the debt was conjugal [4]. Petitioner appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the conjugal property acquired prior to the New Civil Code may be executed upon for the husband's debt.
2. W/N the sale of the residential land on execution included the mineral claim.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that since the property was acquired prior to the effectivity of the New Civil Code, the wife cannot object to the disposal thereof by the husband, or the attachment on execution of the property in payment of a debt contracted by the husband [5, 6]. Furthermore, the lower court found as a fact that the judgment debt was a conjugal debt, a finding deemed admitted in a direct appeal to the Supreme Court involving only questions of law [4, 7].

2. **NO.** While the initial attachment included both the residential land and the mining claim, the Certificate of Sale expressly described only the residential land and improvements, *without* including the Bua Mineral Claim [8, 9]. Consequently, the redemption by respondents could not have included the mineral claim, as one cannot redeem what was not sold [10, 11]. Moreover, the Mining Law (Sec. 4) expressly declares that ownership of land for other purposes (agricultural, residential, etc.) does not include ownership of the minerals found therein [12].

The judgment is **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**, declaring the mineral rights of Marcos Comilang free from the execution or sale [13].
