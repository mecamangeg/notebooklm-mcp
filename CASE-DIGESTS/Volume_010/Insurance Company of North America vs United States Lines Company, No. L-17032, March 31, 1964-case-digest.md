I. CAPTION
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. UNITED STATES LINES COMPANY and/or MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-17032, March 31, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On August 16, 1957, Firestone International Company (New York) shipped 18 cases of machinery on board the *SS Pioneer Main* of United States Lines Company, consigned to Firestone Tire and Rubber Company of the Philippines [1]. The shipment arrived in Manila on September 15, 1957, was unloaded into the custody of the Manila Port Service (MPS), and subsequently delivered to the consignee's broker [1]. However, the delivery was short by one case valued at P1,852.93 [1].

The consignee filed a claim with the Insurance Company of North America (petitioner), which paid the insurance value and was subrogated to the consignee's rights [2]. The petitioner filed an action for damages in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against U.S. Lines and MPS [2]. The CFI found that U.S. Lines had delivered the shipment in good order to MPS, but held MPS liable for the missing case [3]. However, the CFI limited MPS's liability to P500 based on Section 15 of the Arrastre Management Contract, as the value of the missing package was not specified or manifested [3]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that as a non-party to the Management Contract, it should not be bound by the P500 limitation [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the insurer, as subrogee of the consignee, is bound by the limitation of liability clause in the Arrastre Management Contract despite not being a signatory to it.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding the petitioner bound by the Management Contract [5].

The Court reasoned that while the consignee was not a signatory, it became bound by the Management Contract when it obtained delivery of the goods through its broker using a gate pass and delivery permit [4]. These documents specifically referred to the Management Contract and reproduced the substance of Section 15 ("Important Notice"), which limits liability to P500 per package unless the value is otherwise specified [6]. By using these documents to demand delivery, the consignee effectively accepted the terms of the Management Contract [7]. The Court applied the doctrine settled in *Northern Motors v. Prince Line* and similar cases, stating that the insurer, as subrogee, stands in the shoes of the consignee and is subject to the same defenses and contractual limitations [4, 7].

Since the value of the missing package was not manifested, the liability was correctly limited to P500 [5]. The decision of the CFI was affirmed [5].
