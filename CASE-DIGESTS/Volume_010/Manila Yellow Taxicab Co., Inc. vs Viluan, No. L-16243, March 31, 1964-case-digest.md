I. CAPTION
MANILA YELLOW TAXICAB CO., INC. v. FRANCISCA VILUAN, G.R. No. L-16243, March 31, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Manila Yellow Taxicab Co., Inc. operated ten taxicab units in San Fernando, La Union. On September 19, 1957, claiming its units were insufficient, Petitioner applied for twenty additional units. Pending this application, Respondent Francisca Viluan applied for a certificate of public convenience to operate ten taxicabs in the same territory. Petitioner opposed Respondent's application, arguing that its own existing and proposed units were sufficient, that Respondent's entry would cause ruinous competition, and that as an old operator, Petitioner should be preferred [1].

On October 28, 1958, the Public Service Commission (PSC) granted Petitioner an increase of only fifteen units instead of the requested twenty. Petitioner moved to dismiss Respondent's application, arguing that the PSC's partial grant to Petitioner constituted a factual finding that only fifteen more units were needed in the area. The PSC denied the motion and, on October 14, 1959, granted Respondent a certificate to operate five taxicab units. Petitioner appealed, claiming the PSC erred in granting Respondent's application after limiting Petitioner's own increase [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission erred in granting Respondent a certificate of public convenience for five units.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Public Service Commission's order. The Court held that the determination of whether conditions in a specific area justify granting an application is a question of fact [4]. The law invests the Commission with broad discretion in its supervision and control over public transportation. The Court will not interfere with this discretion or substitute its own opinion for that of the Commission, except in cases of clear abuse, which was not shown in this case [4].

Furthermore, the Court noted that Petitioner's application was granted on October 28, 1958, while Respondent's was granted nearly a year later on October 14, 1959. The Court reasoned that during this intervening period, it was entirely possible that pertinent conditions in the area had sufficiently changed to justify the additional units awarded to Respondent [5].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [5].
