I. CAPTION
**MARIA ROA v. HON. JUDGE L. PASICOLAN, EMILIO SANTOS, and ROSENDA S. VDA. DE GOLDING**, G.R. No. L-18482, January 31, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Maria Roa filed a complaint against respondents Emilio Santos and Rosenda S. Vda. de Golding to annul a 1938 deed of sale executed by Potenciana Ducuco. On November 2, 1960, the trial court rendered a decision dismissing the complaint and upholding the validity of the sale [1, 2]. Petitioner received the decision on November 18, 1960. She subsequently filed a notice of appeal and a petition to appeal as a pauper, which was denied on December 7, 1960 [2].

On December 10, 1960, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration on the grounds that the decision was contrary to law, specifically Article 776 of the Civil Code regarding the transmission of rights, and contrary to the evidence [2]. On February 23, 1961, respondent Judge Pasicolan issued an order disapproving the record on appeal. The Judge ruled that the motion for reconsideration was *pro forma*, did not interrupt the 30-day appeal period, and that the decision had already become final and executory due to the failure to post an appeal bond [3]. Petitioner filed for certiorari after her motion to reconsider this order was denied [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's motion for reconsideration was *pro forma* and failed to interrupt the prescriptive period for appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court erred in treating the motion for reconsideration as *pro forma* and dismissing the appeal without expressly denying the motion. The petitioner was entitled to a resolution of said motion [4, 5].

The Court found that the motion raised valid legal points regarding Article 776 of the Civil Code and questioned the trial court's appreciation of specific testimonial evidence [4, 6]. Although the arguments in the motion were "not so clear as might be desired," they deserved to be ruled upon on the merits rather than being dismissed as merely *pro forma* [6]. Consequently, the motion interrupted the period to appeal.

The petition was **GRANTED** and the order set aside [7].
