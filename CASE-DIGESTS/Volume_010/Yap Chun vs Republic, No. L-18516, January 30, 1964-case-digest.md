I. CAPTION
YAP CHUN alias JOSE GO TIANSE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18516, January 30, 1964, J.B.L. Reyes, J.

II. FACTS
This is the third appeal regarding the naturalization application of Yap Chun (alias Jose Go Tianse) [1]. His first petition, granted by the lower court in 1950, was reversed by the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-4177) because his child of school age in China was not enrolled in Philippine schools [1]. His second petition was also reversed (G.R. No. L-8642) because he had neglected to bring his son, Go Li Pen, to the Philippines despite having over ten years to do so before relations with China were interrupted [2].

In this third application, Yap Chun argued that the disqualification no longer applied because Go Li Pen had attained the age of majority [3]. He further argued that his marriage to a Filipina reduced the residence requirement to five years [3]. The Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental again granted the petition, and the Republic appealed [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner’s disqualification for failure to enroll his child in Philippine schools is cured by the child attaining the age of majority.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the applicant's disqualification is not cured by the lapse of time or the fact that the child is now past school age [4, 5]. The neglect to bring his son to the Philippines while of school age is *res judicata* under previous decisions [6].

The Court emphasized that compliance with the requirement of enrolling children in local schools is evidence of the petitioner's honest and enduring intent to assume the duties of Filipino citizenship (*Ng Sin v. Republic*, G.R. No. L-7590) [7]. Failure to do so reflects adversely on the applicant's *bona fide* intention to embrace Filipino customs and ideals [6]. If an applicant reveals by his acts that he is unwilling to assume the obligations of citizenship, his application becomes untenable and dangerous to the State [5].

The judgment appealed from is REVERSED, and the application for naturalization is ORDERED DISMISSED with prejudice [5].
