I. CAPTION
SINFORIANO V. URGELIO, JOSE V. ENCABO, and JORGE M. VILLARIN v. SERGIO OSMEÑA, JR., THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF CEBU CITY, et al., G.R. No. L-14908, February 28, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Urgelio, Encabo, and Villarin were employees of the City of Cebu whose positions were abolished by the respondents. In a decision dated October 31, 1963, the Supreme Court declared the abolition of their positions to be in bad faith and ordered the City of Cebu to reinstate them and pay back salaries [1], [2]. Respondents filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that: (1) petitioners were not civil service eligibles and thus not permanent; (2) petitioners acquiesced to their separation by receiving terminal pay; and (3) the City of Cebu is immune from liability for back salaries under Section 5 of its Charter (C.A. No. 58) [2], [3], [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioners waived their right to question their illegal dismissal by accepting terminal pay.
2. W/N the City of Cebu is liable for back salaries despite the immunity clause in its Charter.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The acceptance of terminal pay by illegally dismissed employees does not constitute a waiver of their right to question the termination of their services [5], [3]. The Court distinguished this from the case of *Magana v. Agregado*, where the employee was estopped because he accepted a specific gratuity provided in the very resolution that abolished his office; no such gratuity was provided or received in this case [3]. Furthermore, although the petitioners were not civil service eligibles, they were GSIS members, indicating permanent tenure, and their separation was based on a bad faith abolition of office rather than the expiration of temporary appointments [2].

2. **YES.** (The City is liable; the immunity does not apply). Section 5 of the Charter of the City of Cebu (C.A. No. 58), which exempts the city from liability for damages or injuries arising from the negligence or failure of city officers to enforce laws, does not apply to the payment of back salaries to illegally dismissed employees [5], [4]. Citing *Mission v. Del Rosario* and subsequent cases, the Court held that the City is obligated to pay arrears in salary to employees whose positions were wrongfully abolished [6].

The Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED** [7].
