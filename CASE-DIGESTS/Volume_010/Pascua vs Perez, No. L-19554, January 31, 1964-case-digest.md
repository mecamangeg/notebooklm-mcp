I. CAPTION
PURIFICACION PASCUA v. HON. JESUS Y. PEREZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19554, January 31, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Purificacion Pascua mortgaged two parcels of land to respondent Elisa Paraiso Vda. de Verzosa to secure a P25,000.00 loan. When Pascua failed to redeem the mortgage, Verzosa foreclosed extrajudicially and purchased the property. Pascua filed an action to annul the foreclosure sale, claiming the transaction was usurious [1].

The lower court ruled in favor of Pascua, declaring the transaction usurious and annulling the sheriff's sale. However, the decision ordered Verzosa to allow Pascua to redeem the property upon payment of P20,100.00 plus interest, without specifying a period for this redemption [2]. Later, Verzosa filed a motion claiming Pascua failed to redeem within one year of the decision and prayed for title to be vested in her. The lower court granted the motion and declared title vested in Verzosa [3, 4]. Pascua filed a petition for certiorari.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court erred in holding that the petitioner failed to redeem the property within one year.
2. W/N the lower court could validly vest title in the respondent for petitioner's failure to pay the redemption amount.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the lower court erred because no period was fixed either in the body or the dispositive part of the annulment decision for the redemption of the property [5]. It is unfair to hold the petitioner delinquent in exercising her option when the court overlooked specifying the period within which redemption should be effected [5].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that vesting title outright was erroneous. Since the sheriff’s sale was annulled, Pascua remained the owner of the property [6]. The trial court's order allowing "redemption" upon payment was actually a directive to pay the debt. Upon Pascua's failure to pay the P20,100.00, the respondent's only remedy was to file a motion for execution in the annulment case to collect the loan amount and interest, not to claim ownership of the property [6, 7].

Petition is granted. The order of the respondent court is set aside [7].
