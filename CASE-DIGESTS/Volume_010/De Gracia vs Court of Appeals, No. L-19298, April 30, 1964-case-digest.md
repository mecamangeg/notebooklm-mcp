I. CAPTION
EUGENIO S. DE GRACIA v. COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-19298, April 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
In July 1950, petitioner Eugenio De Gracia commissioned Celedonio Benipayo (owner of Lucky Press & Photo-Engraving) to print composite pictures of House Representatives members for P540.00. De Gracia paid an advance of P140.00 but could not pay the P400.00 balance when the items were ready [1]. To induce Benipayo to deliver the pictures, De Gracia assigned to him credits/accounts due from four Congressmen totaling P400.00 and provided authorization letters [1]. Relying on this assignment, Benipayo delivered the goods [2]. However, when Benipayo attempted to collect from the House accounting office, he discovered that De Gracia had already collected the amounts himself [2]. Benipayo filed a civil action for recovery and a criminal complaint for Estafa. The Court of First Instance found De Gracia guilty of Estafa [3]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, citing findings from the civil case regarding the status of the credits [2, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the decision in the civil case is admissible in the criminal case to prove the status of the credits.
2. W/N De Gracia is liable for Estafa.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While the general rule is that a decision in a civil case is not admissible in a criminal case due to the difference in the quantum of evidence required (preponderance vs. proof beyond reasonable doubt), the citation of the civil decision here was proper because it was merely confined to the "status of the assigned credits in question" [5]. It was used only to establish the material fact that the credits had been withdrawn, a fact also independently proven by testimonies and records in the criminal trial [5].

2. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the withdrawal by the accused of credits assigned by him to the offended party to induce the latter to deliver goods, without turning over the collected amounts, constitutes Estafa [6, 7]. The Court found that the assignment was a fraudulent scheme or cunning used by De Gracia to induce Benipayo to part with his property [8]. Criminal intent was proven by the overt act of withdrawing the very credits he had assigned before the complainant could collect them [8].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED [9].
