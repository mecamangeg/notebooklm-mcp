**I. CAPTION**
MONCADA BIJON FACTORY v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and UNITED WORKERS UNION, G.R. No. L-16037, April 29, 1964, Padilla, J.

**II. FACTS**
The United Workers Union, representing laborers of Moncada Bijon Factory, filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) demanding improved working conditions, overtime pay, and wage differentials. The petitioner factory refused these demands. On May 18, 1953, the factory closed. Consequently, on May 28, 1953, the laborers filed an urgent motion asking the CIR to order the factory to reopen and to readmit them to work. The petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction. The issue of reinstatement was later amicably settled and approved by the court on March 28, 1955.

The CIR rendered a judgment ordering the petitioner to pay overtime wages and wage differentials. The petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, resulting in a tie vote *en banc*, which was broken by Judge Bugayong voting to affirm the judgment. The petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court via certiorari, questioning the CIR's jurisdiction and the validity of the monetary awards under the Minimum Wage Law (R.A. No. 602) and Eight-Hour Labor Law (C.A. No. 444).

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over the case.
2. W/N the laborers are entitled to overtime pay and wage differentials.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court held that the demand for improved working conditions, overtime pay, and wage differentials, followed by the employer's refusal, constitutes an industrial dispute that threatens or is likely to occur, placing it within the CIR's jurisdiction. Although the initial petition did not explicitly ask for reinstatement, the subsequent urgent motion to reopen the factory and readmit the workers—which was amicably settled—was tantamount to a petition for reinstatement.

2. **YES.** The award is proper but subject to modifications based on prescription and the effectivity of relevant laws.
*   **Overtime Pay:** The order to pay overtime wages of at least 25% of the basic wage is in accordance with C.A. No. 444 (Eight-Hour Labor Law). However, under Article 1145 of the Civil Code, the collection of unpaid overtime wages for work rendered before May 13, 1947, is barred by prescription (6 years prior to the filing on May 13, 1953).
*   **Wage Differentials:** The payment of wage differentials is valid under R.A. No. 602 (Minimum Wage Law) starting from its effectivity on August 4, 1951. Laborers cannot collect wage differentials prior to this date as no law fixed the minimum wage at that time.

**Judgment affirmed with modification.**
