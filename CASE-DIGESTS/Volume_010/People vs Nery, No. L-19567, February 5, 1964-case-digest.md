I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SOLEDAD NERY, G.R. No. L-19567, February 5, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On November 15, 1954, Soledad Nery received two diamond rings from Federico Matillano in Bacolod City to be sold on commission, with the agreement to deliver P230.00 or return the rings the next day [1]. Nery failed to return the rings or proceeds [2]. After being found by police on January 5, 1955, she promised in writing to pay by January 25, but failed to do so [2, 3]. A complaint was filed in the municipal court but was dismissed or withdrawn after Nery made two partial payments of P20.00 each [3]. When she failed to pay the balance, an Information for estafa was filed in the Court of First Instance (CFI) on June 30, 1958 [3]. While the case was pending, Nery executed a deed on October 10, 1958, promising to pay the balance in installments [3, 4]. The trial court convicted her of estafa [5]. Nery appealed, arguing that the acceptance of partial payments and the compromise agreement novated the original contract, converting her liability from criminal to civil [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N criminal liability for estafa is extinguished by novation through partial payments and a compromise agreement executed after the criminal case has been instituted in court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that while the novation theory might apply prior to the filing of the criminal information—converting the trust relation into a creditor-debtor situation—it does not apply once the authorities have taken cognizance of the crime [8]. The crime of estafa is an offense against the State, and only the State can renounce it; the offended party cannot divest the prosecution of its power to exact criminal liability [8].

The Court further explained that novation is not a recognized mode of extinguishing criminal liability under the Penal Code [9]. Even in Civil Law, mere acceptance of partial payments does not produce novation without proof of intent to extinguish the original relationship [10]. Citing *People v. Benitez* and *People v. Gervacio*, the Court reiterated that a criminal offense may not be waived by the offended party, and a compromise does not obliterate criminal liability already incurred [11]. Finally, the dismissal of the earlier charge in the municipal court did not affect the case, as that court lacked jurisdiction over the offense [12].

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [12].
