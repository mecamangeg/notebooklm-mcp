**I. CAPTION**
MANILA RAILROAD CO. vs. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-19377, January 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Mariano Canalda worked as a trackman for the Manila Railroad Company since 1946. On April 23, 1959, while working and perspiring under the heat of the sun, he was suddenly overtaken by a heavy downpour. As a result, he fell ill, was hospitalized, and died of lobar pneumonia six days later. On February 4, 1960, his heirs filed a claim for compensation. The hearing officer denied the claim, ruling the death was not compensable. However, the Workmen's Compensation Commission reversed this decision and awarded death benefits. The petitioner appealed, arguing that lobar pneumonia is not an occupational disease and that the claim was barred because it was not filed within the 3-month statutory period required by Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the employee's death from lobar pneumonia arose in the course of employment and is compensable.
2. W/N the claim is barred by the claimants' failure to file within the statutory period.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** Although lobar pneumonia is caused by a virus (*pneumococcus*) and is not strictly an occupational disease, the sickness was contracted in the course of employment. The Court held that the deceased was performing his usual duties, perspiring under the sun, when the rain caught him, lowering his resistance and causing the illness. The sudden change in temperature while working was the direct cause of the sickness that led to his death [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The company is deemed to have waived the defense of non-compensability due to late filing. The record showed the foreman was notified of Canalda's sickness and hospitalization, yet the company failed to submit the report to the Commission as required by Section 37 of the Workmen's Compensation Act. Citing *Martha Lumber Mill, Inc. v. Lagradante*, the Court ruled that failure to submit the employer's report of accident or sickness constitutes a waiver of the defense that the claim was not filed within the statutory period [3, 4].

Decision affirmed [4].
