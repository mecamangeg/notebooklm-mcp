I. CAPTION
DALMACIO DADURAL, JOSE RAGUDO and CATALINA DOYANEN v. THE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS and ARMANDO LIM, G.R. No. L-18120, April 29, 1964, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Dadural, Ragudo, and Doyanen filed a motion with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) for the issuance of a supplemental order and writ of execution. They sought to compel respondent landholder Armando Lim to deliver their harvest shares for the agricultural years 1956 to 1960 and to liquidate the 1960-1961 crop. This motion was filed after the Supreme Court had already ruled in a previous case (G.R. No. L-13891) that the petitioners had no tenancy relationship with Lim. The CAR denied the motion, stating it had no jurisdiction and nothing to execute because the Supreme Court had found no tenancy relationship existed. Petitioners argued that an earlier CAR judgment dated July 22, 1957, which ordered the delivery of their shares, had not been set aside.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction to enforce the delivery of harvest shares after a finding that no tenancy relationship exists between the parties.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the CAR's denial of the motion due to lack of jurisdiction. The Court reasoned that the earlier CAR judgment (July 22, 1957) ordering the delivery of shares was strictly "predicated on the finding that the herein petitioners... had been tenants of the respondent landholder" [1]. However, a subsequent CAR resolution (November 26, 1957) and the Supreme Court's own decision in G.R. No. L-13891 definitively established that "petitioners had no agricultural tenancy relationship with the respondent landholder" [1]. Since the existence of a tenancy relationship was the basis for the delivery order, the finding that no such relationship existed effectively set aside the order [1]. Without a tenancy relationship, the CAR lacks jurisdiction, and the petitioners must resort to courts of general jurisdiction to claim their shares [2, 3]. The resolutions of the Court of Agrarian Relations were affirmed.
