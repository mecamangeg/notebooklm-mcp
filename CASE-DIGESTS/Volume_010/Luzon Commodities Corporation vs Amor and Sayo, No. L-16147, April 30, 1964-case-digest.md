I. CAPTION
LUZON COMMODITIES CORPORATION v. AMOR AND SAYO, G.R. No. L-16147, April 30, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Luzon Commodities Corporation filed a collection suit against Amor and Sayo (doing business as Sunrise Hills Veterans Housing Project) for construction materials. Amor and Sayo impleaded the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), claiming the housing project and materials were transferred to GSIS. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila ordered GSIS to pay Luzon Commodities P10,255.40 and to pay Amor and Sayo P50,498.50 on their cross-claim. GSIS appealed directly to the Supreme Court, assigning errors regarding the exhaustion of remedies against the debtors, the existence of a guaranty, the use of the materials in the project, and their valuation [1-5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Supreme Court held that it lacked jurisdiction because the appeal involved mixed questions of law and fact, and the amount in controversy did not exceed the statutory threshold. The Court noted that resolving the issues raised by GSIS—such as the credibility of evidence, the existence of a guaranty, and the valuation of materials—would require an examination of the evidence [5]. Furthermore, the total amount involved was only P60,753.90. Under Republic Act No. 2613, the jurisdictional amount for the Supreme Court was increased to P200,000.00 [6]. Since the amount was below P200,000.00 and the case involved factual questions, the proper forum was the Court of Appeals [6].

Records of the case forwarded to Court of Appeals for proper disposition.
