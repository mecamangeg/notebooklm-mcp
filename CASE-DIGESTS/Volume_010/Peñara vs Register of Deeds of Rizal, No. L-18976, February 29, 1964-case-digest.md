I. CAPTION
DAMASO PEÑARA and JULITA TIMTIMAN v. THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF RIZAL, SOFIA S. BOSTON and THE HEIRS OF WILLIAM BOSTON, G.R. No. L-18976, February 29, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On November 15, 1960, petitioners Damaso Peñara and Julita Timtiman sought to register a Deed of Sale executed on August 25, 1942, by Sofia S. Boston covering two parcels of land under Original Certificate of Title No. 444. The title was a free patent issued to "Sofia S. Boston... married to William Boston." The Register of Deeds denied registration because, although the deed bore the signature "W.S. Boston," there was no indication it was the husband's signature or that he had ratified the sale.

The petitioners appealed to the Land Registration Commission (LRC). The LRC ruled that the land was Sofia's exclusive property as the patent was granted solely to her, implying she acquired it before marriage or via separate right; thus, she could alienate it without her husband. The oppositors-appellants, Sofia and the Heirs of William Boston, appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the property was conjugal because the title was issued during the marriage and stated she was "married to William Boston."

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the land granted via free patent is conjugal property.
2. W/N the sale is valid and registrable even if the property were considered conjugal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the land is presumed to be the wife's exclusive (paraphernal) property. The free patent was granted to "Sofia S. Boston" only, without joining the husband as a co-owner. The Court presumed the land was acquired through the wife's occupation alone while she was yet unmarried. Had the land been acquired through joint efforts, the patent would have stated so.

2. **YES.** Even assuming *arguendo* that the property was conjugal, the sale is valid. The Deed of Sale bore the signature "W.S. Boston" jointly with Sofia. The Court found that since the authenticity of the signature was not questioned, it must be accepted as that of her husband, William Boston. His unquestioned signature served as proof of his participation in the sale, rendering further ratification unnecessary.

The ruling of the Land Registration Commission is affirmed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
