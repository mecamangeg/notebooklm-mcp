I. CAPTION
BOARD OF ASSESSMENT APPEALS v. MANILA ELECTRIC COMPANY, G.R. No. L-15334, January 31, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Manila Electric Company (Meralco), holder of a franchise under Act No. 484, constructed 40 steel towers in Quezon City to support high voltage transmission wires running from its hydroelectric plant in Laguna to Manila. These towers are constructed of steel bars joined by bolts, resting on metal frames atop adobe or mud without concrete foundations, and can be dismantled and moved. On November 15, 1955, the City Assessor of Quezon City declared these towers for real property tax. Meralco paid the tax under protest and claimed exemption, arguing the towers were "poles" exempt under its franchise and were not real property. The Board of Assessment Appeals upheld the tax. On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled in favor of Meralco, ordering the cancellation of the tax declarations and a refund. The petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the steel towers constitute "poles" exempt from taxation under Meralco's franchise.
2. W/N the steel towers constitute real property subject to real property tax.
3. W/N the City Treasurer is liable for the refund despite Quezon City not being impleaded.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The steel towers are exempt as "poles" under Act No. 484. The term "pole" should not be given a restrictive interpretation limiting it to wooden or cylindrical objects. It refers to an "upright standard to the top of which something is affixed or by which something is supported." The towers' sole function is to support the wires, and US jurisprudence confirms that "towers" and "poles" are used interchangeably in electric power transmission contexts [1], [2], [3].

2. **NO.** The steel towers are not real property under Article 415 of the Civil Code. First, they are not "adhered to the soil" (Art. 415, par. 1) as they are not analogous to buildings and do not have concrete foundations. Second, they are not attached in a "fixed manner" (Art. 415, par. 3) because they are bolted to frames and can be dismantled without breaking or deterioration. Third, they are not machinery or implements intended for an industry "on the land" (Art. 415, par. 5) because Meralco is not engaged in an industry on the specific land where the towers are located [4], [5], [6].

3. **YES.** The City Treasurer is responsible for the refund. The contention that Quezon City is the real party in interest and was not impleaded is a technicality raised for the first time on appeal. Factually, the City Treasurer insisted on the payment and received the taxes paid under protest [7], [8].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED.
