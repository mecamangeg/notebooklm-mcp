**I. CAPTION**
**MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, et al.**, G.R. Nos. L-17871, L-18200, L-18160, and L-18249, January 31, 1964, Padilla, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Manila Railroad Company (MRR) is a government-owned or controlled corporation. Respondent unions (Station Employees' Union, et al.) filed petitions with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) alleging that their members worked more than 8 hours a day and 40 hours a week (often working 6 to 7 days) without additional compensation, in violation of Republic Act No. 1880 (40-Hour 5-Day a Week Law) and Commonwealth Act No. 444 (Eight-Hour Labor Law). They demanded implementation of the law and payment of overtime. MRR moved to dismiss, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction and that R.A. 1880 did not apply to it. MRR further argued that as a public utility, it was exempt from paying additional compensation for work on Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.

The CIR ruled in favor of the unions, holding that it had jurisdiction and that MRR was covered by R.A. 1880. The CIR ordered MRR to pay the employees "double" compensation for work rendered on the 6th and 7th days of the week. MRR appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over the disputes.
2. W/N Manila Railroad Company is covered by Republic Act No. 1880 (40-Hour Labor Law).
3. W/N the employees are entitled to double compensation for work performed on the 6th and 7th days of the week.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The CIR has jurisdiction because the demand for compensation for work done in excess of legal hours, which the employer refused to pay, constitutes a dispute that could likely lead to a strike if not settled. Under the law, such threats to industrial peace fall within the CIR's cognizance [1, 2].

2. **YES.** MRR is covered by R.A. 1880. Section 3 of the Act explicitly states it applies to "all laborers employed in government-owned and controlled corporations." MRR does not fall under any of the specific exceptions (schools, courts, hospitals, etc.) mentioned in the Act or Executive Order No. 251 [3, 4].

3. **NO.** The award of double compensation is legally unfounded. Under Commonwealth Act No. 444, public utilities providing transportation (like MRR) may compel employees to work on Sundays and legal holidays. For such work, the law only requires the payment of the regular wage if the work does not exceed 8 hours. If the work exceeds 8 hours, the employee is entitled to the regular wage plus at least 25% additional compensation. There is no statutory basis for paying "double" the regular remuneration for work on these days [5, 6].

**Disposition:** The orders or judgments under review are **MODIFIED** to remove the double compensation award; employees are entitled to their regular wage for work on the 6th and 7th days if not exceeding 8 hours, and overtime pay of at least 25% only if exceeding 8 hours. The rest of the judgments are **AFFIRMED**.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Justices Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred.)
