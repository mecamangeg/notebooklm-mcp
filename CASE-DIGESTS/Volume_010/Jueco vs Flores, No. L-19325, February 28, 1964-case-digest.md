**I. CAPTION**
**ISABEL Q. JUECO v. FELICIDAD FLORES**, G.R. No. L-19325, February 28, 1964, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Felicidad Flores filed a claim with the Department of Labor against Petitioner Isabel Q. Jueco for the death of her son, Emiliano Flores. Felicidad alleged that Emiliano was employed as a truck helper by Jueco and was killed on April 25, 1957, when he was pinned between two trucks owned by the petitioner [1]. Jueco denied the employer-employee relationship, presenting a payroll for April 1-30, 1957, which did not contain Emiliano's name [2]. Jueco also claimed she had already paid Felicidad P400.00, arguing this was for subsidiary liability arising from the driver's negligence, not workmen's compensation [3]. The Hearing Officer ruled in favor of Felicidad [4]. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed the decision but modified the amount, ordering Jueco to pay P1,996.80 in compensation, burial expenses, and attorney's fees [5]. Jueco appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N an employer-employee relationship existed between the petitioner and the deceased.
2. W/N the respondent was fully dependent on the deceased.
3. W/N the petitioner is liable for attorney's fees.
4. W/N the P400.00 previously paid by the petitioner should be deducted from the compensation award.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court found substantial evidence of the relationship. Co-workers issued statements to police on the day of the accident identifying the deceased as their co-worker [6]. The absence of Emiliano's name in the payroll was explained by the fact that the payroll was prepared on the first day of the month, while Emiliano was hired on the 23rd and died on the 25th, before an entry could be made [7]. A subsequent retraction by a witness was disregarded as it was likely made to support the petitioner's motion for a new trial [6].

2. **YES.** The controlling factor in determining dependency is the extent of the claimant's dependency at the time of the workman's death [8]. The WCC found that Felicidad was wholly dependent on her son's earnings when he died, regardless of whether she received occasional aid from others when he was unemployed [9].

3. **YES.** Under the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 3428), the employer is liable for attorney's fees if found liable for compensation [8]. While Section 31 is silent on who pays, reading it in relation to Sections 7, 29, and 47 reveals the legislative intent to keep the compensation intact for the claimant. Requiring the claimant to pay fees would diminish the compensation prohibited by law [10, 11].

4. **YES.** Although the P400.00 was allegedly paid under a different law regarding subsidiary liability, the Court ruled that in the interest of justice and fairness, it should be treated as an advance payment of the compensation adjudged under the Workmen's Compensation Law [12, 13].

**Disposition:** The decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the P400.00 paid be deducted from the total award [14].
