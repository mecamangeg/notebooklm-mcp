**I. CAPTION**
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GUILLERMO BELLO**, G.R. No. L-18792, February 28, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Guillermo Bello, 54, and Alicia Cervantes, 24, lived together as common-law husband and wife. Due to poverty, Bello induced Alicia to work as a hostess at "Maring's Place." Jealous of her customers, Bello watched her daily. On May 20, 1958, Bello asked Alicia for money but was refused and insulted by the bar owner, Maring, who called him an invalid. On his way home, Bello was mocked by neighbors as a man whose wife was being used for "white slave trade." Deeply hurt, Bello drank *tuba*, returned to the bar, held Alicia from behind, and stabbed her repeatedly with a *balisong*. He surrendered to the police immediately. The Court of First Instance of Quezon convicted him of Murder with the aggravating circumstances of treachery, evident premeditation, nighttime, superior strength, and obvious ungratefulness, sentencing him to death.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the crime committed is Murder qualified by treachery, evident premeditation, or superior strength.
2. W/N the generic aggravating circumstances of nighttime and obvious ungratefulness are present.
3. W/N the mitigating circumstance of passion and obfuscation should be appreciated.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The crime is Homicide. **Treachery** is absent because the four stab wounds were inflicted indiscriminately; the stab in the back was merely a continuation of the aggression as the victim ran away [1]. **Evident premeditation** is not established as Bello carried the *balisong* only as a precaution against drunkards, and there was no evidence of a plan to kill born from his jealousy [2]. **Superior strength** is not present because there was no clear evidence of a deliberate intent to take advantage of it (*intencion deliberada de prevalerse de la superioridad*), noting that Bello was old and an invalid while Alicia was young and healthy [2].

2. **NO.** **Nighttime** is not an aggravating circumstance because Bello did not seek it to facilitate the crime, and the crime scene (Maring's Place) was bright and well-lighted [3]. **Obvious ungratefulness** and abuse of confidence are also absent. The fact that the victim gave Bello money does not imply ungratefulness since they lived as husband and wife, and no special confidence was abused to facilitate the crime [4].

3. **YES.** The Court appreciated **passion and obfuscation**. Bello was provoked by the insults regarding his wife's "prostitution" and her refusal to leave her work as a hostess. His insistence that she abandon "gainful promiscuity" to live with him again does not arise from immoral or unworthy passions [5, 6].

**Disposition:** Decision **MODIFIED**. Accused is found guilty of **Homicide** with two mitigating circumstances (voluntary surrender and passion and obfuscation) and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) day of *prision mayor* to ten (10) years of *prision mayor* [7].
