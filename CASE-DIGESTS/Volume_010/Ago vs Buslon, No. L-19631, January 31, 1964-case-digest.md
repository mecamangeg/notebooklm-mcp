I. CAPTION
PASTOR D. AGO v. HON. TEOFILO B. BUSLON, MONICA URBIZTONDO and PEDRO ORCULLO, G.R. No. L-19631, January 31, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Monica Urbiztondo and Pedro Orcullo filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Surigao against Petitioner Pastor D. Ago, seeking the payment of rentals and damages for the use of a private road and the destruction of trees [1]. The total claim was less than P5,000. In his answer, Ago alleged that the road traversed the land of one Olimpia C. Jalandoni, not the respondents', thereby contesting their title [2]. He also filed a counterclaim for damages amounting to P37,000 [2].

After denying Ago's motions for postponement due to conflicting hearings in Manila, the CFI rendered a decision on June 13, 1961, ordering Ago to pay damages and rentals [2-4]. Ago filed a motion to set aside the decision and dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction, which was denied on November 24, 1961 [5]. Ago received notice of the denial on January 6, 1962, but did not appeal. Instead, on April 6, 1962, he filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the CFI lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter and that the decision was void [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction over the case despite the main claim being under the jurisdictional amount of P5,000.
2. W/N the petition for certiorari is the proper remedy.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of First Instance had jurisdiction. Although an action for the recovery of not more than P5,000 falls within the exclusive original jurisdiction of justice of the peace courts, the respondents premised their action upon their alleged title to the land, which the petitioner contested [7]. This put the title to the land in issue, the determination of which is within the exclusive original competence of the CFI [7]. Furthermore, the petitioner’s compulsory counterclaim of P37,000 was within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the CFI. Jurisdiction can be sustained if the compulsory counterclaim exceeds the jurisdictional amount, even if the original claim does not [7].

2. **NO.** Certiorari is not the proper remedy. The petitioner could have appealed the decision and the order denying his motion to set aside, which would have been a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy [6]. However, he failed to take any steps to seek relief until long after the expiration of the reglementary period for appeal. It is well settled that the writ of certiorari may not be availed of to make up for the loss, through omission or oversight, of the right to appeal (citing *Casilan v. Ibañez*, *Santos v. Vda. de Cerdenola*, and others) [6].

Petition denied; case dismissed [8].
