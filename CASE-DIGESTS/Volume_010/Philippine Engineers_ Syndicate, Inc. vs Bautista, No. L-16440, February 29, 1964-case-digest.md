I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE ENGINEERS' SYNDICATE, INC. v. HON. JOSE S. BAUTISTA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16440, February 29, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On December 28, 1958, respondent Federico Benitez and 64 other employees filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against petitioner Philippine Engineers' Syndicate, Inc., a domestic construction corporation [1]. The employees alleged that they rendered service at night but were paid wages equivalent only to day-shift rates, without extra compensation. They claimed entitlement to a 50% differential for such night work [1]. Petitioner moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, arguing that upon the enactment of Republic Act No. 875, the CIR's jurisdiction was limited to specific cases (national interest disputes, minimum wage, 8-hour labor law, and unfair labor practices) and that regular night work did not fall under these categories as it is not considered "overtime" [2-4]. The CIR Presiding Judge ruled that the court was competent to hear the case [2]. Petitioner filed this special civil action to prevent the CIR from assuming jurisdiction [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over claims for additional compensation for regular night work.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) retains jurisdiction over suits for additional compensation for regular night work [5, 6]. The Court rejected the petitioner's argument that Republic Act No. 875 removed this authority. Citing *National Rice & Corn Corp. (NARIC) vs. NARIC Workers Union* and *Shell Co. vs. National Labor Union*, the Court held that while night work is distinct from overtime work covered by the Eight-Hour Labor Law (Commonwealth Act No. 444), the CIR possesses the general power under Commonwealth Act No. 103 to determine the wages night workers should receive [7]. If the industrial court has the power to fix just wages for day work, it logically has the same power regarding night work [8]. To hold otherwise would curtail the CIR's jurisdiction to an extent that would defeat the purpose of the Magna Carta of Labor [9].

Order and resolution affirmed; petition dismissed [5].
