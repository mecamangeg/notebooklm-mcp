I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. NICOLAS MOJICA Y GIRA, G.R. No. L-17234, March 31, 1964, 10 SCRA 515, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On March 24, 1959, inside the New Bilibid Prisons at Muntinlupa, Rizal, Gabriel Buclating, a leader of the "OXO gang," was killed by members of the rival "Sigue-sigue gang" at around 4:00 p.m. To avenge his death, accused-appellant Nicolas Mojica and co-accused Primitivo Ala (both OXO members) conspired to kill a Sigue-sigue member. Approximately two hours later, at 6:00 p.m., they stabbed prisoner Ruperto Artus in Cell No. 1, Dormitory 3-C. Immediately after, both surrendered to prison guard Jose Magkalas and, upon his order, threw out their weapons (an icepick and a flat pointed instrument). Mojica and Ala executed extrajudicial confessions admitting they planned the killing to avenge their leader.

While Ala pleaded guilty and was sentenced to death (affirmed in G.R. No. L-15633), Mojica pleaded not guilty, claiming his confession was coerced by unknown men and his surrender forced by gang leaders. The Court of First Instance of Rizal found Mojica guilty of murder and sentenced him to death. The case was elevated to the Supreme Court for automatic review.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Mojica's extrajudicial confession is admissible against him.
2. W/N the killing constitutes murder qualified by evident premeditation and treachery.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The extrajudicial confession is admissible because it was voluntarily executed and substantially corroborated by other evidence. The Court found Mojica’s claim of coercion unconvincing as he subscribed the statement before the Assistant Director of Prisons without complaint and failed to identify his alleged torturers [1]. Furthermore, the confession was corroborated by the testimony of the prison guard who saw Mojica holding the specific weapon described in the confession and by the location of the victim's wounds, which matched the details provided by Mojica [2].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that evident premeditation was present because sufficient time had elapsed from the inception of the plan (4:15 p.m.) to its execution (6:00 p.m.) for the accused to reflect on their actions [3]. Treachery was also appreciated as the attack was sudden and carried out by two armed men who stabbed the victim forty times, ensuring his death without risk to themselves [3]. Conspiracy was likewise established through the extrajudicial confessions showing a shared agreement to avenge their gang leader [3].

The judgment *en consulta* is affirmed in all parts and respects.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. The decision was unanimous (Per Curiam), with Chief Justice Bengzon and Justices Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurring [4].
