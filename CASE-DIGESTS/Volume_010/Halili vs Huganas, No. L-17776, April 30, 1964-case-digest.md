I. CAPTION
FORTUNATO F. HALILI v. RAFAEL HUGANAS, JUAN GERARDO, Workmen's Compensation Commissioners, SHERIFF OF MANILA and SHERIFF OF QUEZON CITY, G.R. No. L-17776, April 30, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On May 26, 1958, respondent Rafael Huganas filed a claim for compensation against petitioner Fortunato F. Halili with Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor [1]. The Hearing Officer awarded compensation, which was affirmed by the Workmen's Compensation Commission [1]. When the Sheriff of Quezon City attempted to execute the award, Halili filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon City to enjoin the execution, arguing that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, which authorized the administrative agencies to act, was unconstitutional [1]. The CFI ruled in favor of Halili, declaring the proceedings before the Regional Office and Commission null and void, and ordered the sheriff to refrain from action [1]. Huganas appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is valid regarding jurisdiction over workmen's compensation claims.
2. W/N the Regional Offices of the Department of Labor have the power to enforce their awards by writs of execution.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is valid insofar as claims for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act are concerned [2]. Citing *Madrigal Shipping Co. v. Workmen's Compensation Commission* and *Stoll v. Mardo*, the Court held that the lower court erred in invalidating the proceedings before the administrative agencies on the ground of unconstitutionality [2, 3].

2. **NO.** Regional Offices of the Department of Labor are not empowered to enforce their awards by writs of execution, as only courts of justice are authorized to issue such writs [3]. Relying on *National Shipyards v. Calixto* and *Pastoral v. Commissioner of the Workmen's Compensation Commission*, the Court ruled that the execution directed by the Labor Regional Office was improper [3].

Consequently, although the lower court erred in its reasoning regarding jurisdiction, its order preventing the Sheriff from carrying out the writ of execution is **AFFIRMED** [3, 4].
