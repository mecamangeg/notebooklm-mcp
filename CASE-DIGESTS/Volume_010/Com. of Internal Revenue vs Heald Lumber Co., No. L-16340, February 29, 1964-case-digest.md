**I. CAPTION**
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. HEALD LUMBER COMPANY, G.R. No. L-16340, February 29, 1964, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Heald Lumber Company, a domestic corporation, was incorporated in 1934 with a capital stock divided into 1,000 no-par value shares. Upon original issuance, the company paid the documentary stamp tax (DST) based on the actual consideration received from subscribers. In 1950, the company had a surplus of over P300,000. The stockholders resolved to transfer P300,000 from the surplus account to the capital account to meet increasing activities, explicitly stating this would not change the status, character, or number of the 1,000 no-par value shares already issued.

In 1956, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) assessed the company for additional DST and penalties, arguing that the transfer of surplus to capital resulted in an increase in capitalization per share. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue upheld the assessment. On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) reversed the Commissioner’s ruling, holding the company not liable. The Commissioner petitioned the Supreme Court for review.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a transfer of surplus to capital, which increases the stated value of outstanding no-par value shares without the issuance of new stock certificates, is subject to additional documentary stamp tax.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's decision.

The Court ruled that under **Section 212 of the National Internal Revenue Code**, the DST on no-par value shares is based on the "actual consideration received... at the time of the original issuance of the certificates." This provision must be construed in relation to **Section 210**, which levies the tax "at the time such act is done or transaction had." Consequently, any additional consideration received in the future is of no consequence for DST purposes.

Furthermore, a documentary stamp tax is an **excise tax** on the privilege of issuing certificates, not on the business transacted or the share of stock itself. Since the tax targets the document (the certificate), it can be collected only once—when the certificate is originally issued. In this case, the transfer of surplus was a mere bookkeeping transaction that did not increase the number of shares nor result in the issuance of new certificates. The Court cited the American case *United States v. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.*, which held that a mere transfer of surplus to capital without the issuance of additional shares does not constitute an "original issue" subject to stamp tax.

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
