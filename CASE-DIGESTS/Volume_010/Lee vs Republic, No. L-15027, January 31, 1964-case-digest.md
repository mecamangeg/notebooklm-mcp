**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF JIMMY LEE TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. JIMMY LEE, petitioner-appellee, vs. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, oppositor-appellant, G.R. No. L-15027, January 31, 1964, Dizon, J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
On October 23, 1953, Jimmy Lee, a Chinese national, sent his Declaration of Intention to become a Filipino citizen to the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) by registered mail [2]. However, he did not pay the required P10.00 filing fee at that time; the fee was only paid on May 23, 1956, upon demand [3]. On November 17, 1956, Lee filed his petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo [2].

On August 15, 1958, the CFI rendered judgment admitting Lee to Philippine citizenship [4]. Upon later review, the Solicitor General discovered the late payment of the filing fee and filed a motion to annul the proceedings on October 29, 1958 [3]. The OSG argued that the jurisdictional requirement of filing the Declaration of Intention at least one year before the petition was not met because the effective filing date was the date of payment (May 1956), which was only 5 1/2 months before the petition (November 1956) [3]. The CFI denied the motion to annul, prompting the Republic's appeal [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Declaration of Intention was validly filed one year prior to the petition for naturalization despite the late payment of the filing fee.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that the filing of the Declaration of Intention produced no legal effect until the required filing fee was paid [5].

Section 5 of the Naturalization Law requires the Declaration of Intention to be filed at least one year before the filing of the petition for citizenship [6]. Regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Justice also require the payment of a filing fee upon the filing of said declaration [6]. Applying the principle in *Lazaro vs. Endencia* (57 Phil. 552), the Court ruled that steps taken for a legal purpose are of no value if the corresponding fees are unpaid [5]. Consequently, Lee's declaration was deemed filed only on May 23, 1956 (payment date), which was merely 5 1/2 months before he filed his petition on November 17, 1956 [5]. This violation of the one-year jurisdictional requirement rendered the entire proceeding void [7].

The order appealed from is set aside, and all proceedings granting the petitioner's application for citizenship are declared null and void [7].
