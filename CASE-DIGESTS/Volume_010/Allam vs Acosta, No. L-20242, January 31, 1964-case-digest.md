I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO ALLAM, ET AL. v. VALENTINA ACOSTA, NIEVES BULAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20242, January 31, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents (defendants in the lower court) appealed a decision of the Court of First Instance of Isabela to the Court of Appeals. After an initial procedural delay, respondents were required to file their brief. Over the course of several months, respondents changed counsel three times. With each change, they requested and were granted extensions of time to file their brief by the Court of Appeals. These four extensions prolonged the original 45-day period to over 170 days. Petitioners (appellees) moved to dismiss the appeal, but the Court of Appeals denied the motion, noting that the respondents had finally filed their brief on May 10, 1962, within the last extended period. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, alleging the Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion in granting the extensions based merely on changes of counsel.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed due to the Court of Appeals' grave abuse of discretion in granting multiple extensions for filing the brief.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that while the multiple changes of counsel did not constitute "good and sufficient cause" to justify several extensions under Section 16, Rule 48 of the Rules of Court, the appeal should not be dismissed. The Court observed that the respondents' brief had already been filed on May 10, 1962. Consequently, even assuming the Court of Appeals exercised its discretion unduly in granting the extensions, the error was not of such "serious character and gravity" as to warrant the dismissal of the appeal once the brief was already part of the record.

Petition dismissed.
