**I. CAPTION**
GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM v. GSIS EMPLOYEES' ASSOCIATION and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-17185, [Date not provided in source], Padilla, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) sought a review of the judgment and resolution *en banc* of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) regarding labor demands and a strike that occurred on June 17, 1953 [1]. The CIR had ruled it possessed jurisdiction over the dispute. On July 6, 1959, GSIS filed a "motion for clarification and reconsideration" of the judgment [2]. The CIR denied the clarification on August 13, 1959, and subsequently, the CIR *en banc* denied the motion for reconsideration on March 14, 1960, holding that a motion for clarification does not suspend the period for appeal [3, 4]. GSIS filed its notice of appeal on July 22, 1960, and the petition for certiorari on July 26, 1960 [5]. GSIS contended the CIR lacked jurisdiction as its employees are governed by Civil Service Law, while the respondents argued the judgment was already final and the appeal was time-barred [6, 7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has jurisdiction over labor disputes involving the GSIS.
2. W/N the petition for review was filed within the reglementary period.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court held that the petitioner's contention is untenable. Citing *GSIS v. Castillo*, the Court reiterated that the CIR has jurisdiction over labor disputes affecting government-owned or controlled corporations. Furthermore, Section 11 of Republic Act No. 875 explicitly recognizes that while terms of employment in the government are governed by law, this provision applies to employees in governmental functions, not those in proprietary functions of the government, including government corporations [8-10].

2. **NO.** The appeal was not taken within the period provided by law. The CIR *en banc* promulgated the resolution denying the motion for clarification and reconsideration on March 14, 1960. The petitioner only filed its notice of appeal on July 22, 1960, and the petition on July 26, 1960. More than four months had elapsed between the promulgation of the resolution and the filing of the appeal. The Court affirmed the CIR's view that a motion for clarification does not suspend the period to file a motion for reconsideration or appeal [7, 10].

Petition dismissed [11].
