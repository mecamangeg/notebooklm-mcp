I. CAPTION
IGNACIO VERDERA and CANUTO BARRIENTOS v. JAIME HERNANDEZ, as Secretary of Finance and GENERAL SHIPPING CO., INC., G.R. No. L-18511, January 22, 1964, Concepcion, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On May 18, 1955, a collision occurred between the M/S "General Malvar," owned by respondent General Shipping Co., Inc., and the sailboat "Rogelio," owned by petitioners Verdera and Barrientos [2]. The Board of Marine Inquiry (BMI) investigated and rendered a decision on February 21, 1956, clearing the officers of the "General Malvar" of responsibility [2]. Petitioners received a copy of the decision on March 3, 1956, and filed a notice of appeal with the BMI on April 2, 1956 [2].

The Commissioner of Customs ruled that the appeal was not perfected because it was not filed "in the Office of the Secretary of Finance" within 30 days as required by Section 1198 of the Revised Administrative Code [2]. The Secretary of Finance and the Office of the President sustained this view [2]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, claiming abuse of discretion, but the CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the appeal requirements were not fulfilled [2-4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the filing of a notice of appeal with the Board of Marine Inquiry constitutes valid compliance with the requirement to file the appeal in the Office of the Secretary of Finance. [3, 5]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that under Section 1198 of the Revised Administrative Code, two steps are necessary for the perfection of an administrative appeal: (1) the appeal must be perfected and filed in the Office of the Secretary of Finance; and (2) this must be done within thirty (30) days after the promulgation of the decision appealed from [4].

The Court rejected the petitioners' argument that filing with the BMI sufficed because the Bureau of Customs is under the supervision of the Department of Finance [5]. The Court held that the Bureau of Customs and the Office of the Secretary of Finance are distinct and separate offices under the Revised Administrative Code [5]. The existence of executive supervision precisely proves that they are distinct entities; otherwise, providing for an appeal from one to the other would be unnecessary [5]. Since the notice of appeal was never filed with the Office of the Secretary of Finance, the decision became final [2, 6].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed [6].
