I. CAPTION
PASUMIL WORKERS UNION v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and NATIONAL LABOR UNION, G.R. No. L-19628, April 30, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent National Labor Union filed a complaint charging petitioner Pasumil Workers Union with unfair labor practice under Section 4(a), sub-paragraph 3 of Republic Act No. 875 [1]. The complaint was based on a "Memorandum of Agreement" dated September 26, 1959, wherein the Pampanga Sugar Mills paid the petitioner union the sum of P4,500.00 [1, 2]. The agreement stipulated that the payment was made "purely in the interest of harmonious relations" as an "assistance of the Company to the Union for whatever worthy project the latter may undertake" [2]. Petitioner contended that the amount actually represented a settlement for the vacation leave pay of seasonal laborers for the years 1954-1955, a claim which had been pending since a strike in 1949 [3, 4]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) rejected this explanation, held that the amount was a gift/assistance rather than payment for services, and ordered the union disestablished [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the receipt of P4,500.00 by the union from the company constituted unfair labor practice under RA 875.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The payment did not constitute unfair labor practice. The Supreme Court found that the P4,500.00 was payment for an actual and valid claim for vacation leave pay for seasonal laborers for the years 1954 and 1955, which was reduced due to a compromise [6, 7]. The Court held that the statement in the agreement describing the payment as "assistance" in the "interest of harmonious relations" was merely a superfluity inserted to justify the company directors' action in granting the vacation pay [8, 9]. Since the money was given in settlement of a valid claim, it was not a gift or assistance prohibited by Section 4(a), sub-paragraph 3 of Rep. Act No. 875 [9]. Furthermore, the Court noted that compromises are encouraged under Article 2028 of the New Civil Code and the Rules of Court [10].

The decision appealed from is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE [11].
