I. CAPTION
RIZAL CEMENT WORKERS UNION (FFW), FRANCISCO OLORES, ET AL. v. MADRIGAL & COMPANY, RIZAL CEMENT COMPANY, INC., CANDIDO DE LEON and JOHNNY DE LEON & COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-19767, April 30, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On May 28, 1956, twenty-one members of the Rizal Cement Workers Union (the Union) reported for work at the Bodega Tanque of Rizal Cement Co., Inc. (the Company) in Paco, Manila [1, 2]. They were denied entry by the warehouse manager, who acted on instructions from the Company's general manager [2]. The Company had locked out these workers because the Union had staged a strike the previous day at the Company's factory in Binangonan, Rizal, causing damage to property [2, 3]. The management apprehended that sabotage might also be committed at the Bodega Tanque, where products and machinery were stored [3, 4].

The Union filed a complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP), claiming the refusal to admit the 21 workers was discriminatory and violated Section 4(a)(4) of the Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act No. 875) [5]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled that the lockout was a defensive weapon forestalling possible sabotage and not ULP [6]. It ordered reinstatement but limited back wages to start only from May 28, 1961 (the finality of the decision in the main strike case), rather than from the date of the lockout in 1956 [6]. The Union appealed, arguing for full back wages [1, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Company's lockout of the 21 union members constituted unfair labor practice (ULP) under Republic Act No. 875.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR decision. Under Section 4(a)(4) of Republic Act No. 875, for discrimination regarding tenure or conditions of employment to be considered an unfair labor practice, the act must be committed to "encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization" [4, 7].

The Court found that the Company's refusal to allow the complainants to work was not intended to induce them to renounce their union membership or deter non-members from joining [4]. Instead, it was a measure born out of justified apprehension that sabotage might be committed in the warehouse, similar to what occurred at the Binangonan factory [4]. Since the lockout was a defensive weapon and not an act of ULP, the award of back wages was properly limited to commence only from the finality of the decision in the main case (May 28, 1961), consistent with the ruling for the strikers in the main factory [4].

Petition denied. Decision and resolution affirmed.
