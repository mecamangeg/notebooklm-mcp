I. CAPTION
MANUELA ADVINCULA, represented by her guardian-ad-litem, Pura Borbon v. MANUEL ADVINCULA, G.R. No. L-19065, January 31, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
In 1956, petitioner Manuela Advincula filed Civil Case No. 3553 for acknowledgment and support against respondent Manuel Advincula [1]. On motion of both parties, which stated that the plaintiff had lost interest and had no further evidence, the case was dismissed [2]. The motion contained the phrase "with prejudice," but the trial court's order of dismissal was silent on whether it was with or without prejudice [2, 3]. In 1961, Manuela filed a second complaint (Civil Case No. 5659) against Manuel for the same cause of action [1]. Manuel filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the dismissal of the first case was "with prejudice" and barred the second suit [1]. The trial court dismissed the second case, ruling that since the 1956 order made no reservation, it was a dismissal with prejudice [1, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the prior case for acknowledgment and support bars the filing of a subsequent action for the same cause.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal order.

First, under Section 2, Rule 30 of the Rules of Court, a dismissal at the plaintiff's instance is "without prejudice" unless otherwise specified in the order [4]. Since the trial court's order was silent, the dismissal is deemed without prejudice, regardless of the fact that the parties' motion requested it be "with prejudice" [4, 5]. The Court clarified that Section 4 of Rule 30 (dismissal as adjudication on the merits) only applies to dismissals not provided for in the rule; since this dismissal falls under Section 2, Section 4 does not apply [6].

Second, the obligation to give support is essentially provisional and judgments for support never become final [7]. Furthermore, under Article 2035 of the Civil Code, acknowledgment and future support cannot be the subject of compromise [8, 9]. Consequently, a former dismissal based on a compromise (plaintiff withdrawing due to loss of interest) cannot bar a subsequent action for acknowledgment and support [9].

The Order was set aside and the case was remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Dizon and Makalintal concurred in the result, while Justice J.B.L. Reyes reserved his vote [10].
