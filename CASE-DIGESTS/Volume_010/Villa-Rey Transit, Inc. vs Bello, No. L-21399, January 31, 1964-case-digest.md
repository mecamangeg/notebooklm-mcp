I. CAPTION
VILLA-REY TRANSIT, INC. v. HON. ELOY B. BELLO, FLORENTINA ASUNCION, THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF PANGASINAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21399, January 31, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Villa-Rey Transit, Inc. was the defendant in a complaint for damages filed by respondents (Asuncion et al.) in the CFI of Pangasinan regarding the death of Felipe Tejada. On September 18, 1961, respondent Judge Bello declared petitioner in default for failure to answer, and subsequently rendered a default judgment awarding P70,100.00 to plaintiffs.

Petitioner filed a "Motion to Lift Order of Default" and a "Motion for New Trial or to Set Aside Judgment" set for hearing on October 5, 1961. However, on October 4, 1961, before the trial court could resolve these motions, petitioner filed a petition for Certiorari with the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-18957) challenging the default orders. The Supreme Court denied L-18957 on April 23, 1963, ruling that the petition was premature and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.

Subsequently, petitioner filed a "Motion to Reset Hearing" of its previous motions in the trial court. Respondent Judge denied the motion to reset and ordered execution, ruling that petitioner had abandoned its motions by elevating the matter to the Supreme Court in L-18957. Petitioner then filed the present petition for Mandamus and Certiorari.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion or unlawfully neglected a duty in refusing to hear the petitioner’s motions for relief from judgment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the petition.

The Court held that the respondent Judge did not abuse his discretion. In the previous decision (G.R. No. L-18957), the Court already stated that the default orders were legal and valid. Petitioner's act of filing the previous certiorari before the trial court could resolve its pending motions was a "gamble." Having lost that gamble, petitioner cannot compel the trial court to pass upon motions it effectively abandoned to seek relief from the appellate court. The Court noted, "One cannot eat his cake and have it too."

Furthermore, the trial court's refusal to set the hearing constituted a "virtual denial" of the motions to lift default and for new trial. The proper remedy against such denial was an **appeal**, not certiorari or mandamus. Certiorari is not available to correct errors of fact or law done in the valid exercise of jurisdiction. Mandamus does not lie because, the motions being deemed abandoned or denied, there was no right of the petitioner excluded and no duty on the part of the respondent Judge to perform.

The petition was **DENIED**, the order complained of affirmed, and the preliminary injunction dissolved.
