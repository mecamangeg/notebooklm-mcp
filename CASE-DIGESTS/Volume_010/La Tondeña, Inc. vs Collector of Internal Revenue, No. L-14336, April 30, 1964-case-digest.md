I. CAPTION
LA TONDEÑA, INC. v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE and COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-14336, April 30, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner La Tondeña, Inc. is a domestic corporation engaged in manufacturing wines and liquors, and rectifying and denaturing ethyl alcohol [1]. It produces "specially denatured alcohol" for its own use in manufacturing "Jai-Alai" rubbing alcohol, or for sale to permittees of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) [1]. For over 23 years, the BIR treated this denatured alcohol as tax-free [1]. However, in 1955, the BIR assessed petitioner for unpaid specific taxes on 391,396 proof-liters of denatured alcohol used in rubbing alcohol and other medicinal preparations from July 1951 to May 1954, amounting to P268,153.73 [1].

The petitioner appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), arguing that rubbing alcohol is not a "medicinal preparation" under the Tax Code because it is not for oral intake, and that denatured alcohol is not "distilled spirits" [2, 3]. The CTA affirmed the BIR's assessment, ruling that the exemption under Section 128 for industrial use applies only to the operation of industries, not to alcohol used as an ingredient in medicinal products [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N rubbing alcohol is a "medicinal preparation" containing "distilled spirits" as its chief ingredient, rendering it subject to specific tax under Sections 127 and 133 of the Tax Code.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed that rubbing alcohol is a medicinal preparation and is subject to specific tax, though it modified the amount due.

The Court held that "medicinal preparations" under Section 127 of the Tax Code include substances used for curative or alleviative purposes, regardless of whether they are for internal or external use [6, 7]. The petitioner itself advertised "Jai-Alai" rubbing alcohol as an antiseptic and disinfectant, clearly establishing its medicinal character [8]. Furthermore, the Court rejected the argument that denatured alcohol is not "distilled spirits." Section 133 expressly defines distilled spirits to include ethyl alcohol and all its "dilutions or mixtures" [9]. Since denatured alcohol is admitted to be ethyl alcohol mixed with additives, it falls within this definition [9].

However, the Court ruled that the tax liability attaches to the medicinal product (the rubbing alcohol) itself, not the manufactured ethyl alcohol, and certainly not to the alcohol sold to other BIR permittees [10]. Consequently, the decision was **MODIFIED**, holding the petitioner liable only for P24,708.60, representing the specific tax on the 35,298 proof liters of rubbing alcohol it actually marketed [10, 11].
