I. CAPTION
CEBU PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY v. MAXIMO S. SAVELLANO, SR., ET AL., G.R. No. L-19317, April 30, 1964, J.B.L. Reyes, J.

II. FACTS
On September 2, 1955, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ordered Petitioner Cebu Portland Cement Company to reinstate Respondent Savellano and others with back salaries from November 16, 1950. The Petitioner complied by reinstating Savellano on March 14, 1956, paying his back salaries at his old rate of P9,600 per annum. However, during the pendency of the case, specifically starting October 1, 1951, the Petitioner had granted whole-scale and general salary increases to its officials and employees. Savellano was refused these benefits, unlike his co-petitioners and other employees. The CIR ordered the payment of the salary differential representing these increases. Petitioner appealed, arguing that paying back salaries at the old rate satisfied the judgment and that the CIR had no jurisdiction to grant salary increases.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the computation of backwages for an illegally dismissed employee should include general salary increases granted to other employees during the period of dismissal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the Petitioner granted whole-scale and general increases to its employees irrespective of individual merit or qualification during the pendency of the case. Consequently, by reason of his unlawful dismissal, Savellano lost not only what he would have received at his old rate but also what he would have received at the corresponding increased rate. The Court ruled that while granting salary increases is discretionary, the Petitioner had already exercised that discretion generally. It cannot exclude the Respondent from benefits extended *en masse*, as this would prejudice him through his illegal dismissal—a result the company had no right to cause and the labor court had the power to prevent. The CIR did not assume jurisdiction to grant a new increase but merely enforced the company's own act to prevent unjustified discrimination.

The Order of the Court of Industrial Relations is **AFFIRMED**.
