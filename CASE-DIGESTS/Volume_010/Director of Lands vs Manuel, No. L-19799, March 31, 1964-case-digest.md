I. CAPTION
DIRECTOR OF LANDS v. PAULINO MANUEL, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19799, March 31, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On October 6, 1949, respondent Paulino Manuel filed a homestead application to replace a 1931 application he claimed was lost during the war [1]. Based on this, Homestead Patent No. V-5117 was issued to him on April 22, 1950 [2]. However, the Director of Lands subsequently found that the land overlapped with the application of Feliciano Valeroso [3]. An investigation revealed a 1947 affidavit where Manuel admitted transferring all his rights to Valeroso in 1933 and stating he was no longer interested in the land [4]. On May 31, 1954, the Director of Lands rendered a decision declaring that Manuel had relinquished his rights and that the patent was improperly issued [5]. Manuel did not appeal this administrative decision, and it became final [6]. The Director of Lands filed a petition for cancellation of Manuel’s patent, but the lower court dismissed the petition [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the homestead patent issued to Manuel is null and void based on the findings of the Director of Lands.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the patent is null and void [8]. The question regarding the transfer of rights from Manuel to Valeroso had already been passed upon by the Director of Lands, who found that Manuel had relinquished his rights and employed fraudulent means to secure the patent [9]. Since Manuel failed to appeal this administrative decision, it became final and executory and can no longer be looked into [9]. A homestead patent secured through fraudulent misrepresentation, concealing the fact that the applicant had already relinquished his rights to another, is null and void [8, 10].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and Patent No. V-5117 as well as the corresponding certificate of title are declared null and void [8].
