I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ARSENIO MIRANDA, EMILIANO DAJAY, and RUPERTO PRINCIPE, G.R. Nos. L-18508 & L-18509, February 29, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On the night of December 28, 1957, Clemente Pastera and his wife Thelma, accompanied by her brothers Aquilino and Alfredo Castellanes, were walking home from a dance in Dingle, Iloilo. The three accused—Emiliano Dajay, Arsenio Miranda, and Ruperto Principe—suddenly emerged from a banana grove. Dajay stabbed Clemente in the abdomen, while Miranda slashed Alfredo on the back. Immediately after the attack, the wounded Alfredo told his wife, and Clemente told witnesses, that Dajay and Miranda were their assailants. Clemente died two days later. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo convicted Miranda of Attempted Murder and all three accused of Murder. The accused appealed, claiming self-defense and arguing that the prosecution witnesses were biased because they were related to the victims.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the prosecution witnesses should be discredited due to their relationship with the victims.
2. W/N the victims' statements identifying the assailants constitute part of the *res gestae*.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the mere fact that the principal prosecution witnesses were related to the victims does not prove that they were prejudiced or biased. Their testimonies were deemed clear, convincing, and corroborated by other witnesses.
2. **YES.** The Court ruled that a victim's revelation to a witness of the identity of the assailants immediately after receiving wounds is legal evidence as part of the *res gestae*, citing *People v. Quiamson* (62 Phil. 162). The Court further found the claim of self-defense improbable and the conspiracy proven by a witness who heard the accused plotting the crime.

Decision affirmed.
