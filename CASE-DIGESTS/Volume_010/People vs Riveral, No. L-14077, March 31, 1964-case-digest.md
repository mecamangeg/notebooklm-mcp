**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. TEODULO RIVERAL, JUAN ROMENA, SILVESTRE ADVINCULA, ALFREDO ROMENA and FERMIN REDULME, G.R. No. L-14077, March 31, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
On October 28, 1951, at around 4:00 PM, Petronio Rigunay (a candidate for mayor), Daniel Baltazar, and Vitaliano Argel were travelling in a jeep to campaign in Barrio Ermita, San Vicente [1]. As they approached an isolated fork in the road in Barrio San Sebastian, they saw accused Teodulo Riveral and Juan Romena armed with a carbine and pistol, respectively [2]. After passing them, the jeep was subjected to gunfire. Rigunay saw Riveral and Juan Romena, along with co-accused Alfredo Romena, Fermin Redulme, and Silvestre Advincula, firing at them [2]. The jeep crashed into a ditch; Argel was fatally hit, while Rigunay and Baltazar escaped [2]. The motive was identified as acute political rivalry [3]. The accused raised the defense of alibi, claiming they were in Vigan or elsewhere at the time [4-6]. The Court of First Instance convicted the appellants [7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over positive identification by prosecution witnesses.
2. W/N the presence of the co-accused (Silvestre Advincula, Fermin Redulme, and Alfredo Romena) at the scene establishes their criminal liability despite the claim that mere presence does not prove complicity.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that alibi is a weak defense when prosecution witnesses positively identify the accused [8]. The witnesses had no motive to testify falsely and reported the incident immediately [9]. Furthermore, the Court found it physically possible for the accused to be at the scene; for instance, Vigan is only seven kilometers away and accessible by motor car [8].
2. **YES.** While mere presence usually does not prove complicity, the crime occurred in an isolated place where the appellants were waiting armed [10]. The Court found it highly improbable that Silvestre Advincula, Fermin Redulme, and Alfredo Romena were with the armed principals (Riveral and Juan Romena) without being aware of their criminal intent [10]. Their presence evinced "culpable association which crystallized into action" when they participated in the ambush [10]. However, due to a lack of complete evidence of conspiracy regarding these specific appellants, the Court resolved the doubt in their favor by holding them guilty of the "milder form of responsibility" as **accomplices**, affirming the lower court's decision *in toto* [11, 12].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal, JJ., concurred [12]. Padilla, J., took no part [12].
