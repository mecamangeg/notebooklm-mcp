**I. CAPTION**
NATIONAL UNION OF RESTAURANT WORKERS (PTUC) v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20044, April 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
On June 9, 1960, the National Union of Restaurant Workers (PTUC) filed a complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP) against the owners of Tres Hermanas Restaurant, specifically Mrs. Felisa Herrera. The Union alleged that the respondents refused to bargain collectively, attempted to coerce the Union into becoming a company union, and illegally dismissed employee Martin Briones for his union activities.

The record showed that on April 29, 1960, the Union sent a letter of demands to the respondents. Although the respondents did not send a written reply within 10 days, they called a meeting on May 3, 1960, to discuss the demands. During this meeting, Mrs. Herrera agreed to some demands, rejected others, and left some open for discussion. A notation regarding a counter-proposal to recognize the Union only if it became a "company union" was made by Ernesto Tan, a bookkeeper. Subsequently, Martin Briones, who drove the car for Mrs. Herrera, was dismissed. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) dismissed the ULP complaint, finding no refusal to bargain or interference, and that Briones was dismissed for cause. The Union petitioned the Supreme Court for review.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the respondents' failure to reply to the written demands within 10 days constitutes unfair labor practice.
2. W/N the respondents committed ULP by allegedly interfering with the right to self-organization through a counter-proposal for a "company union."
3. W/N the dismissal of Martin Briones was an act of ULP based on union activities.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the condition under Section 14 of Republic Act No. 875, requiring an employer to reply within 10 days from receipt of a written notice of demands, is merely procedural. Consequently, non-compliance with this period cannot be deemed an act of unfair labor practice [1, 2]. The evidence showed the respondents did not ignore the letter but actually called a meeting to discuss the demands, indicating they did not refuse to bargain collectively [3].

2. **NO.** The claim of coercion had no basis because there was no evidence that Ernesto Tan, the bookkeeper who made the notation regarding the "company union" condition, was authorized to represent management [4, 5]. Tan was not even invited to the meeting but volunteered to be present; thus, his unauthorized acts and notations could not be attributed to the respondents as interference with the employees' right to self-organization [6, 7].

3. **NO.** The dismissal of Martin Briones was not due to union activities. The lower court properly credited the evidence showing he was dismissed because of Mrs. Herrera's fear for her life, arising from threats and the hatred Briones entertained against her while they were together in the car he drove for business routine [4, 5]. Furthermore, other employees more active in the union than Briones were retained [5].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [8].
