I. CAPTION
JUAN CABUNGCAL, ET AL. v. HON. JOSE F. FERNANDEZ, Judge, Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, et al., G.R. No. L-16520, April 30, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Daisy Gustilo filed an ejectment case against petitioners (spouses Cabungcal) in the Municipal Court, which ruled against them [1]. Petitioners appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental, which conducted a trial *de novo* and also rendered judgment against petitioners on October 27, 1959 [1]. Following the denial of their motion for reconsideration, petitioners filed a notice of appeal, appeal bond, and record on appeal [1]. On December 22, 1959, the CFI approved the appeal bond and record on appeal despite Gustilo's motion to dismiss [2]. However, before the record on appeal was transmitted to the Supreme Court, Gustilo filed a motion for reconsideration alleging numerous errors in the record [2]. On December 29, 1959, respondent Judge Fernandez issued an order setting aside the previous approval to allow petitioners to answer the opposition regarding the alleged errors [2]. Petitioners filed this petition for certiorari and mandamus, arguing the trial court had lost jurisdiction to issue the December 29 order because the appeal had already been perfected [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court retains jurisdiction to set aside its order approving the record on appeal after the perfection of the appeal but before its transmittal to the appellate court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that while a trial court generally loses jurisdiction over its judgment and cannot vacate it after an appeal is perfected, this rule does not apply to procedural orders regarding the perfection of the appeal itself [3]. Under Sections 13 and 14 of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, the trial court retains the authority to dismiss an appeal on specific grounds prior to the transmittal of the record to the appellate court [3]. The Court reasoned that if the trial court possesses the power to dismiss an appeal entirely, it *a fortiori* (with greater reason) has the jurisdiction to set aside an order approving a record on appeal to verify if it is complete or contains errors [3]. The order in question did not vacate the judgment or affect the issues on appeal, but merely sought to ensure the correctness of the record.

Petition dismissed [4].
