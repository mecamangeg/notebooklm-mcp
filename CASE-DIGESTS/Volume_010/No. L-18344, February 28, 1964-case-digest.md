I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF TAN TEN KOC TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. TAN TEN KOC v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18344, February 28, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Tan Ten Koc filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Samar. To satisfy the notice requirements, the petition was published in "Nueva Era," a Spanish newspaper. Tan Ten Koc reported an annual income of P4,000 and had a wife and twelve children to support. He also claimed exemption from filing a Declaration of Intention, asserting he had resided in the Philippines for 30 years; however, two of his children had stopped schooling allegedly due to marriage and illness. The CFI granted the petition. The Solicitor General appealed to the Supreme Court, challenging the sufficiency of the publication, the lucrative nature of the petitioner's income, and his compliance with the education requirement for exemption.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the publication of the notice in "Nueva Era" complied with the law.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
3. W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a Declaration of Intention.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Section 9 of Commonwealth Act 473 requires publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the province where the petitioner resides. "Nueva Era" is published in Spanish, not in English or the dialect of Samar, and the petitioner failed to present positive proof that it is generally circulated in that province [1], [2], [3].

2. **NO.** An annual income of P4,000 is not considered lucrative for a petitioner who has a wife and twelve children to support [4], [5].

3. **NO.** Under Commonwealth Act 535, exemption from the Declaration of Intention requires that the petitioner give primary and secondary education to *all* his children in government-recognized schools. Two of the petitioner's children stopped schooling; the Court held that marriage is an unsatisfactory reason for stopping studies (citing *Lee Choo v. Republic*), and the petitioner failed to prove that illness made it absolutely necessary for the other child to stop [5], [6].

Decision reversed; petition dismissed [7].
