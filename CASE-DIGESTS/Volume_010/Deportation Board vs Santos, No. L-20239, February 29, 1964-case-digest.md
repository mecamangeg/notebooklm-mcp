**I. CAPTION**
THE DEPORTATION BOARD, MAGNO S. GATMAITAN, ARTURO A. ALAFRIZ and MANUEL V. REYES v. HON. GUILLERMO S. SANTOS and ROBERT LA RUE STEWART, G.R. No. L-20239, February 29, 1964, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
Robert La Rue Stewart, an American resident, was charged before the Deportation Board with being an undesirable alien for allegedly aiding candidates and influencing the 1961 general elections in violation of the Revised Election Code [1]. Stewart moved to dismiss the charges, arguing that under Section 185 of the Revised Election Code, jurisdiction over electioneering charges against aliens lies with the courts, where deportation is an additional penalty imposed only after conviction [1, 2].

The Board Chairman denied Stewart's motion before he could fully state his grounds [1]. Consequently, Stewart filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to restrain the Board from proceeding with the electioneering charges and prayed for a preliminary injunction [1]. The Board opposed the injunction, contending that the President's inherent power to deport cannot be diminished by the Legislature [3]. The CFI granted the writ of preliminary injunction upon Stewart's posting of a P3,000 bond [4]. The Board filed this petition for certiorari and prohibition to nullify the writ [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the lower court gravely abused its discretion in issuing a writ of preliminary injunction against the Deportation Board pending the determination of the jurisdictional issue.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court found no grave abuse of discretion. The issuance of the writ was proper to preserve the *status quo* and prevent the relief sought in the main case (prohibition) from becoming moot or ineffective [6].

The Court held that the principal issue in the lower court—whether the Deportation Board has authority to investigate electioneering charges in light of Section 185 of the Revised Election Code—is a substantial legal question [7]. Citing *Qua Chee Gan v. Deportation Board*, the Court noted there is merit to the contention that the President's deportation power may be limited by grounds enacted by the Legislature [8]. Since it cannot be said at this stage that Stewart is indubitably not entitled to the relief demanded, the suspension of the Board's proceedings via injunction was justified pending the final determination of the jurisdictional question on the merits [9, 10].

The petition is dismissed and the writ denied [10].
