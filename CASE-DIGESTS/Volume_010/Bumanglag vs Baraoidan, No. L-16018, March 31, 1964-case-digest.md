I. CAPTION
JOSE BUMANGLAG v. MELECIO BARAOIDAN and HILARION BARAOIDAN, G.R. No. L-16018, March 31, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On December 31, 1949, petitioner Jose Bumanglag filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte to recover ownership and possession of a parcel of land against respondents Melecio and Hilarion Baraoidan [1]. Petitioner alleged he inherited the land from his parents and that his father had assigned a portion to respondents' father in 1930 for cultivation [1]. Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of *res judicata*, citing Civil Case No. 3841, a suit for recovery of possession and damages filed by petitioner's father against them in 1935 [1, 2]. That previous case was dismissed on October 9, 1936, upon motion of the plaintiff with the conformity of the defendants [2, 3]. The lower court initially denied the motion to dismiss but later issued an order on October 4, 1958, dismissing the complaint on the ground that the action was barred by the dismissal of Civil Case No. 3841 [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the previous case (Civil Case No. 3841) constitutes *res judicata* barring the present action for ownership and possession.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the dismissal of the prior action is not a bar to the present one. Because the order of dismissal in Civil Case No. 3841 was issued on October 9, 1936, its effects are governed by Section 127 of Act 190 (the Code of Civil Procedure then in force) [3]. Under this provision, the court may allow a plaintiff to dismiss his action even after trial has begun and at any time before final judgment, provided that such dismissal is "not a bar to another action for the same cause" [3, 5]. The Court reasoned that if the dismissal does not bar a second action for the same cause (possession), it *a fortiori* cannot bar the present action which principally involves ownership [5].

The order appealed from is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED to the lower court for further proceedings [5, 6].
