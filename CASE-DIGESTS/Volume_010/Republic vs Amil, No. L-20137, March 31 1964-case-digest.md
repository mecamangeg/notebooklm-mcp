**I. CAPTION**
**REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FRANCISCO AMIL and WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION**, G.R. No. L-20137, March 31, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Francisco Amil, a mechanic at the Bureau of Public Highways, injured his left knee on April 16, 1959, while playing in a basketball tournament between the Equipment and Auditing Divisions [1]. The Bureau actively promoted the tournament, which was managed by a committee, approved by the Bureau Commissioner, and played inside the Bureau's premises during office hours [1, 2]. The games were instituted as a matter of policy to improve labor relations and boost employee morale [3]. Amil underwent surgery and was treated at the National Orthopedic Hospital [1]. The Regional Office found the injury compensable, a ruling affirmed by the Workmen’s Compensation Commission *en banc*, though the Commission reduced the award by discarding fees for a private doctor [4]. The Republic appealed, arguing the injury did not arise out of employment and questioning the disability award given that Amil was discharged as "cured" [2, 5, 6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N an injury sustained during a company-sponsored basketball game played within office premises during office hours is compensable.
2. W/N the award for 15% permanent disability conflicts with the claimant's discharge from the hospital as "cured."

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court held that the injury is compensable because the employer actively promoted competitive games during working hours as a matter of policy [3]. The games were not merely permitted for the employees' amusement but were organized to build goodwill, lessen friction, and avoid excessive labor turnover [3]. Citing Larson’s *Workmen's Compensation Law*, the Court ruled that participation in such games is an incident of employment when the activity takes place on the premises near working hours or involves a concurrent benefit to the employer [3, 7].

2. **NO.** There is no irreconcilable conflict between the disability award and the discharge summary. The Court explained that Amil was deemed "cured" only in the sense that he required no further hospitalization or medication [6]. However, the 15% loss of leg activity was permanent and could not be improved by further treatment [6].

The decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission is **AFFIRMED** [6, 8].
