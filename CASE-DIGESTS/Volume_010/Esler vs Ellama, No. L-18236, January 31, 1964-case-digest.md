I. CAPTION
ANGEL ESLER v. DOMINGO ELLAMA and FELOMINO DE LA CRUZ, G.R. No. L-18236, January 31, 1964, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Angel Esler filed an action for unlawful detainer against Defendant Domingo Ellama in the Justice of the Peace Court regarding an agricultural land. The lower court ruled in favor of Esler. Ellama appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI). Pending appeal, the CFI granted Esler's motion for execution, and possession was delivered to him. Subsequently, the CFI dismissed the case, ruling that the Court of Agrarian Relations had jurisdiction under Republic Act No. 1199 (Agricultural Tenancy Act). After the dismissal became final, the CFI issued an order directing Esler to return the land to Ellama. Esler appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that since the dismissal had become final, the CFI could no longer issue the order for restitution.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may order the restitution of property executed pending appeal even after the case has been dismissed with finality for lack of jurisdiction.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that although the order for the dismissal of the case had already become final, the court is authorized, as a matter of principle, to order the return of property erroneously delivered to one party if the original order was issued without jurisdiction. To accept the appellant's argument would be productive of clear injustice. The authority for such restitution is found in **Section 5, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court**, which allows the trial court to issue orders of restitution as equity and justice may warrant when an executed judgment is reversed.

The appeal was dismissed.
