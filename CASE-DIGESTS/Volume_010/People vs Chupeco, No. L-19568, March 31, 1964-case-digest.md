I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JOSE L. CHUPECO, G.R. No. L-19568, March 31, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Jose L. Chupeco was charged in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila with violating the Chattel Mortgage Law. He had executed a chattel mortgage in Manila on July 24, 1946, over sawmill machinery and trucks located in Bataan in favor of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank to secure a P20,000.00 loan [1-3]. The information alleged that on November 28, 1947, Chupeco repledged these properties to Mateo B. Pinili in Manila and removed them to Zambales without the bank's written consent [2].

During trial, the defense and the fiscal agreed to amend the information to charge only the "removal of properties," effectively dropping the "repledging" charge to test the court's jurisdiction, as the removal occurred outside Manila [4, 5]. However, the information remained unamended, and the trial court denied the motion to dismiss, proceeding on the original charge [4]. The CFI convicted Chupeco [4]. He appealed, arguing the Manila court lost jurisdiction due to the stipulation and that the properties pledged were not the same [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CFI of Manila retained jurisdiction over the case despite the agreement to limit the charge to removal of properties.
2. W/N the accused is guilty of the crime of repledging encumbered property under Article 319 of the Revised Penal Code.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The CFI of Manila retained jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the original information, which averred the crime of repledging already encumbered property [7, 8]. Since one of the essential ingredients of the offense—the execution of the first mortgage—took place in Manila, the court acquired jurisdiction [8]. The Court held that jurisdiction, once vested, is not tolled by a subsequent amendment or stipulation between parties, which in this case amounted only to an avowal by the prosecution that it could not establish other elements [7, 8].

2. **NO.** The prosecution failed to prove an essential element of the crime: the identity of the property. The evidence did not show that the properties mortgaged to the bank (listed in Exhibit "D") were the same ones later encumbered to Mateo Pinili (listed in Exhibit "E") [6, 9]. The Court noted the descriptions in the documents were materially different [9]. Under Article 319 of the Revised Penal Code, it is essential that the property removed or repledged be the same or identical property previously mortgaged [9, 10].

**Decision reversed and accused acquitted.** [11, 12]
