I. CAPTION
FORTUNATO F. HALILI v. ANTONIO HERAS, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-18889-90, April 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Halili, owner of Halili Transit, was authorized by the Public Service Commission (PSC) on January 9, 1957, to register and operate 65 buses within Manila and suburbs, with the condition to register them within 30 days [2]. By October 1957, Halili had registered only 30 units and failed to register the remaining 35 [2]. In July 1960, respondents Heras and others filed petitions to cancel Halili's authority over the unregistered units and requested authority to operate them [3]. The PSC consolidated the petitions for cancellation and appropriation into one proceeding and subsequently rendered a decision cancelling Halili's authority for the 35 buses and granting the same to respondents [4, 5]. Halili appealed, contending that the joint hearing was improper and that, as a pioneer operator, he should be given preference to register the units despite the delay [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Public Service Commission erred in jointly hearing the petitions for cancellation and appropriation.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to preference as a pioneer operator to register the remaining units.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Public Service Commission is granted ample power and discretion by law to consider petitions for cancellation and appropriation either singly or jointly [7]. A joint trial is proper as it is less circuitous, avoids duplicity of action, and allows the Commission to take appropriate action, such as cancellation, if the evidence warrants it [7].

2. **NO.** While a pioneer operator is generally given preference to cover required units for expansion, this privilege cannot be invoked where the operator has completely failed to comply with the requirement to register and operate the units for more than three years [8]. Such failure constitutes an abandonment of the service regarding those units [8]. The Court further ruled that alleged shortages of trucks or personal illness are invalid excuses, as other operators were able to secure trucks during the same period and business duties could be performed by representatives [9].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
