I. CAPTION
NG HUA TO and HEIRS OF ONG CHO v. EMILIO GALANG, ETC., G.R. No. L-19140, February 29, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Bondsman Ong Cho executed a cash bond on behalf of petitioner Ng Hua To, an alien temporary visitor. The bond stipulated that Ng Hua To would not engage in any business or employment without the written consent of the Commissioner of Immigration [1]. Ong Cho died on November 29, 1952 [2]. Subsequently, the Commissioner found that the conditions of the bond were violated. He ordered the confiscation of the P2,000.00 cash bond and required Ng Hua To to post a new surety bond of P8,000.00 within three days, under threat of arrest and deportation [2, 3].

Instead of complying or appealing to the Secretary of Justice, petitioners filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance of Manila. They argued that the bond was personal and extinguished by Ong Cho's death, and that the Commissioner's power to order arrest was unconstitutional [2]. The trial court dismissed the petition, ruling it lacked merit [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the death of the bondsman extinguishes the bond for the alien's temporary stay.
2. W/N the petition is barred by failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
3. W/N the Commissioner of Immigration has the authority to order the arrest of the alien for violation of bond conditions.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The death of the bondsman does not extinguish the bond. The commitment binds the bondsman to the purpose of the bond—allowing the alien's stay subject to conditions—regardless of the bondsman's status. The commitment is only released after its purpose is accomplished, not before. To hold otherwise would subject the bond to a contingency not intended by the parties [4].

2. **YES.** The petition was premature because the petitioners failed to exhaust administrative remedies. They could have filed the new bond or appealed the Commissioner's order to the Secretary of Justice, who exercises control and supervision over the Commissioner. Having failed to avail of this remedy, the petition for certiorari/prohibition was defective [5, 6].

3. **YES.** The Commissioner has the authority to order the arrest. The stay of a temporary visitor is subject to contractual stipulations in the bond, including recommitment upon breach. The Commissioner merely enforced this condition to prepare for deportation proceedings under Section 37(a) of Commonwealth Act No. 613. Denying this power would render the law nugatory to the detriment of the State [7, 8].

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [9].
