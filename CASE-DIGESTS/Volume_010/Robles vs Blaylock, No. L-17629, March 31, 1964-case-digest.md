I. CAPTION
GREGORIO ROBLES v. CONCEPCION FERNANDO BLAYLOCK, G.R. No. L-17629, March 31, 1964, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Gregorio Robles held a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) to operate five taxi units in Olongapo, Zambales, granted in December 1959. In February 1960, Respondent Concepcion Blaylock filed an application to operate 10 taxi units in the same municipality. Robles opposed, invoking the "prior operator" rule and claiming that granting Blaylock's application would cause ruinous competition [1, 2]. The Public Service Commission (PSC) granted Blaylock a CPC for five units, authorizing operation within Olongapo and from there to "any point in the island of Luzon." The PSC found that public necessity demanded the service due to the population of 65,000 residents and 8,000 naval personnel, and that existing jitneys were insufficient [3-5]. Robles appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the "prior operator" rule bars the grant of a CPC to the respondent.
2. W/N the PSC erred in granting the respondent a territory of operation extending to "any point in Luzon."

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner cannot invoke the protection of a prior operator because, before Robles was granted his CPC, Blaylock was already operating a taxicab service (Base taxi) under a grant from U.S. naval authorities [7, 8]. Furthermore, the prior operator rule does not apply when the competition would benefit the community. Citing *Carmelo and Oriol vs. Monserrat*, the Court ruled that allowing two companies in the field stimulates business and prevents a monopoly, which serves the best interest of the public [9].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the PSC committed an error in granting a certificate comprising a territory larger than that applied for. The authority to operate should be limited to Olongapo, Zambales, and its suburbs [10, 11].

The judgment of the Public Service Commission is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the area of operation is limited to Olongapo, Zambales, and its suburbs [12].
