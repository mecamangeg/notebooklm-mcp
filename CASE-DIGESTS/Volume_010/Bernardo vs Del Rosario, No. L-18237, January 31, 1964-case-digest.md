I. CAPTION
IRINEO V. BERNARDO v. VICENTE DEL ROSARIO and ANGEL VERAN, G.R. No. L-18237, January 31, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Fiscal Bernardo charged Angel Veran and others with kidnapping for ransom in the Court of First Instance of Quezon [1]. The Fiscal petitioned to discharge Veran from the information to utilize him as a state witness, which respondent Judge Del Rosario granted [1]. However, during the trial, Veran failed to testify on the matters he promised; he showed hostility, claimed an alibi, and categorically stated to the prosecutor that he would not testify against his co-accused [2, 3]. The Fiscal moved to reinclude Veran in the information [2]. The Judge denied the motion, ruling that Veran had "partially complied" and his discharge operated as an acquittal, and held that the Fiscal's remedy was to file a *separate* information against him [4]. Petitioner filed for certiorari [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a discharged state witness who fails to testify as agreed should be reincluded in the same information.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court erred and that the accused must be reincluded in the *same* information.

Under Section 22 of Rule 115 (now Rule 119), the order of discharge amounts to an acquittal "unless the defendant... fails or refuses to testify against his co-defendant" [6]. The discharge is a contract between the accused and the State; if the accused fails to keep his part of the contract by making a full disclosure, he forfeits the immunity [7, 8].

The Court reasoned that filing a separate information would: (1) necessitate a new preliminary investigation; (2) split the case; (3) entail reproduction of evidence; and (4) potentially create a situation where double jeopardy could be raised [9]. Veran's refusal to testify against his co-accused—the principal part of the bargain—warranted his reinclusion in the original case [10].

The writ is granted, the orders of the respondent Judge are set aside, and the case is remanded for further proceedings [11, 12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
