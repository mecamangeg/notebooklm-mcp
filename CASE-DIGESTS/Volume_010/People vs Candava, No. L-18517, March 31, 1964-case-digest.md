I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LORENZO CANDAVA and TEOFILO DE LA PEÑA, G.R. No. L-18517, March 31, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On December 1, 1957, Melecio Mañebo was killed by a gunshot wound in Calapan, Oriental Mindoro. Defendants Lorenzo Candava and Teofilo de la Peña were charged with murder. The prosecution's case rested mainly on the defendants' extrajudicial confessions (Exhibits A and B) subscribed before the Justice of the Peace. In Exhibit A, De la Peña stated he accompanied Candava, who shot the victim due to a grudge involving a love rival. In Exhibit B, Candava admitted to the shooting but denied the love rivalry, claiming he acted out of spite from a previous quarrel.

The defendants retracted their confessions during trial, alleging they were obtained through police duress and torture. They also interposed the defense of alibi. The Court of First Instance of Oriental Mindoro rejected these defenses, convicted them of murder, and sentenced them to life imprisonment.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the extrajudicial confessions are voluntary and admissible despite allegations of duress.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, holding that the extrajudicial confessions were voluntarily made. The Court reasoned that the defendants' claims of duress were entirely uncorroborated; no visitors during their detention saw any physical injuries to support the alleged "terrific beating," and the investigating officers denied the maltreatment.

Crucially, the Court applied the doctrine that variations in confessions indicate voluntariness. The discrepancy between De la Peña’s claim of a "love rivalry" motive and Candava’s denial of it (asserting only a fistfight/spite) proved the confessions were not fabricated by the police. Had the police coerced the statements, they "would have avoided [variations] by seeing to it that each dovetailed fully with the other." Consequently, the alibis were rejected for being uncorroborated, and the decision appealed from was affirmed.
