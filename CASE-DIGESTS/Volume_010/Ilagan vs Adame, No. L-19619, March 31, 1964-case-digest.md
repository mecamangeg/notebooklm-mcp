I. CAPTION
PRISCO ILAGAN v. MACARIO ADAME, G.R. No. L-19619, March 31, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Prisco Ilagan and Concepcion Dimaculangan entered into an oral share tenancy contract in 1947. In June 1954, Dimaculangan sold the land with right to repurchase to respondent Macario Adame. Adame conditioned the purchase on the land being free of tenants so he could cultivate it himself. Ilagan agreed to voluntarily surrender the land to facilitate the sale, subject to the condition that he would be reinstated as tenant upon Dimaculangan's repurchase. Adame initially worked the land but later appointed Casimiro Lalawigan as a temporary tenant after suffering a foot injury.

On January 29, 1960, Dimaculangan repurchased the land. Ilagan demanded reinstatement, but Dimaculangan refused because Lalawigan wished to stay. On June 21, 1960, Ilagan filed a petition for reinstatement and damages with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). The CAR dismissed the petition, ruling that: (1) the action had prescribed as more than five years had elapsed (applying Article 1149, Civil Code); and (2) Ilagan had voluntarily surrendered his right to reinstatement.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action for reinstatement has prescribed.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to reinstatement despite the presence of a new tenant.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the action has not prescribed. The petitioner's action is fundamentally one to enforce an oral contract of tenancy and the security of tenure it provides. Under **Article 1145 of the Civil Code**, an action upon an oral contract must be brought within **six years**. Since the period from Ilagan's dispossession in July 1954 to the filing of the petition in June 1960 was less than six years, the action was filed on time [1]. The lower court erred in applying the five-year period under Article 1149.

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the petitioner's voluntary surrender was conditional upon the repurchase of the land. While the new tenant, Lalawigan, refused to vacate, his designation was merely temporary and due solely to Adame's injury [2]. The Court held that Lalawigan's holding was "precarious" and could not ripen into a tenure that would deprive the petitioner of his promised right to reinstatement [3].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the reinstatement of the petitioner is ordered.
