I. CAPTION
ALIPIO N. CASILAN and PURITA GANGCAYCO v. RAYMOND TOMASSI, SANTIAGO GANGCAYCO and MANUEL GANGCAYCO, G.R. No. L-16574, February 28, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On April 12, 1950, petitioners Alipio N. Casilan and Purita Gangcayco filed a complaint for unlawful detainer in the Justice of the Peace Court (JP Court) of Guiuan, Samar against respondents Raymond Tomassi et al. [1]. The complaint alleged that the parties entered into a verbal lease contract for two quonset huts on November 1, 1949, at a monthly rental of P400.00, and that the respondents failed to pay the rentals from the start of the lease "notwithstanding repeated demands for such payment" [1].

The JP Court rendered judgment ordering the respondents to vacate the premises [2]. The case was appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Samar. After the case was elevated to the Supreme Court twice on procedural grounds and remanded, the CFI eventually conducted a trial on the merits [3, 4]. On June 23, 1959, the CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that the JP Court never acquired original jurisdiction because the complaint failed to allege that a demand had been made upon the defendants to vacate the premises [4]. Petitioners appealed this dismissal [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Justice of the Peace Court acquired jurisdiction over the unlawful detainer case considering the complaint only alleged a demand for payment of rentals and not a demand to vacate.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the allegations in the complaint were insufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the Justice of the Peace Court [5]. The Court found that the complaint only alleged a demand for the payment of the agreed rentals, but contained nothing to the effect that a demand had been made upon the defendants to vacate the premises [5].

Citing *Canaynay vs. Sarmiento*, the Court held that mere failure to pay rents does not *ipso facto* make a tenant's possession unlawful [6]. It is the owner's demand for the tenant to vacate, following the failure to pay rent, that renders the withholding of possession unlawful [6]. Without a demand to vacate, the tenant's possession remains lawful due to the owner's implied consent [6]. Since the complaint failed to allege this essential jurisdictional requirement, the lower court correctly dismissed the case.

Judgment affirmed [7].
