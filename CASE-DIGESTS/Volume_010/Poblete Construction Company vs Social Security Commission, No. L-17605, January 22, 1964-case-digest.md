I. CAPTION
POBLETE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY and DOMINGO POBLETE v. SOCIAL SECURITY COMMISSION and JUDITH ASIAIN, G.R. No. L-17605, January 22, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Judith Asiain filed a petition (Case No. 78) with the Social Security Commission (SSC) to recover death benefits from Poblete Construction Company, alleging that the company failed to report her husband for social security coverage prior to his death [1]. Poblete Construction moved to dismiss the claim for lack of jurisdiction, which the SSC denied [1]. After failing to answer and being declared in default by the SSC, Poblete Construction filed a petition for *certiorari* with injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to restrain the SSC from proceeding [1, 2]. The CFI initially issued a preliminary injunction but subsequently dismissed the case upon the motion of the SSC and Asiain, citing lack of jurisdiction [2, 3]. Poblete Construction appealed, arguing that the SSC lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter and that the CFI erred in dismissing their petition [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to entertain a petition for *certiorari* with injunction against the Social Security Commission.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal, ruling that the Social Security Commission, in exercising its quasi-judicial powers granted by Section 5(a) of Republic Act No. 1161, ranks with the Public Service Commission and the Courts of First Instance [4, 5]. Writs of injunction, *certiorari*, and prohibition may only be issued by a superior court against an inferior court, board, or officer exercising judicial functions [5]. Since the SSC is of equal rank with the CFI, the latter has no jurisdiction to issue such writs against the Commission [5]. Furthermore, the law provides that decisions of the SSC are reviewable by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, confirming its status [5]. The order appealed from is affirmed [6].
