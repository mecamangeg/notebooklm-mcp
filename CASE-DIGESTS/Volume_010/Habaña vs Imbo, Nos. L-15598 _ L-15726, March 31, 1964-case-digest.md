I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED MARIA PASTOR DE TEVES, and PEDRO TEVES; CONRADO HABAÑA and ROSARIO HABAÑA v. JOSE T. IMBO, et al., G.R. Nos. L-15598 & L-15726, March 31, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Pedro Teves and Maria Pastor were deceased spouses whose estates were being settled jointly. Pedro Teves left a will adjudicating Lots 1932 and 6272 to his daughter, Concepcion Teves. All heirs, including the administrator Dr. Jose Imbo, expressly conformed to this distribution. On June 28, 1955, Concepcion sold said lots to petitioners Spouses Habaña.

Subsequently, the executor moved to sell the same lots to pay estate debts, claiming Concepcion had disposed of her rights. The lower court authorized a resale to Administrator Imbo. Spouses Habaña moved to annul this sale, but the court denied them personality to intervene. Imbo later rescinded his purchase to moot Habaña's appeal. Shortly after, the executor again filed a motion to sell the same lots, which Concepcion supported despite her prior sale to Habaña. The lower court granted the motion, disregarding the sale to Habaña because it was made before the judicial approval of the partition. Spouses Habaña appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N an heir can validly sell specific properties adjudicated to them by will before the court approves the final partition.
2. W/N the estate may resell said properties to pay debts after the heir has already sold them to a third party.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the partition made in the will of Pedro Teves must be respected in accordance with Article 1080 of the Civil Code. Concepcion Teves became the absolute owner of the adjudicated lots by operation of law upon the death of the decedent (Article 1091, Civil Code). There is no law prohibiting an heir from selling their share of the estate before the partition is approved by the court (*Cea v. C.A.*; *Jakosalem v. Rafols*). Since the sale to Spouses Habaña was valid and recognized by the co-heirs, the executor and other heirs are precluded from questioning it.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the payment of remaining estate obligations should not be taken from lots already sold by an heir, especially when that heir (Concepcion) had already paid her share of the obligations in full. The executor should instead sell other undisposed properties of the estate. To protect the estate's interest regarding any unpaid debts, the Court suggested that a lien could simply be annotated on the certificates of title of the sold lots, rather than invalidating the sale. The Court also condemned the "double dealing" and bad faith of Concepcion Teves and Administrator Imbo.

The Order was reversed and the case remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings.
