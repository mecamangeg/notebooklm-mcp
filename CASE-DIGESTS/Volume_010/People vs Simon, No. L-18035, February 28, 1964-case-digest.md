I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FELINO SIMON Y CUILAO and REMIGIO DE VERA Y SERRANO, G.R. No. L-18035, February 28, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On October 4, 1958, at around 4:00 AM, Chua Sam arrived at a sari-sari store in Sampaloc, Manila to deliver goods. When he knocked, he was suddenly pulled inside by a man. Once inside, he saw the helper, Benito Co (Co Too), lying face down with hands tied, and another man holding a gun [1]. Chua Sam and Co Too were shot; Co Too died, while Chua Sam survived due to timely medical treatment [2]. Chua Sam identified the assailants as appellants Felino Simon and Remigio de Vera, whom he recognized from the neighborhood [3]. Police found no money or goods missing from the store [2].

The prosecution filed an Information charging them with "attempted robbery in an inhabited house with homicide and frustrated homicide" [4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila initially convicted them, but upon appellant De Vera's motion, the court modified the judgment against him to only Homicide and Frustrated Homicide aggravated by treachery, ruling that attempted robbery was not proven [5]. Both accused appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appellants can be convicted of Murder and Frustrated Murder considering the presence of treachery.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that while the crimes established by the facts were Murder and Frustrated Murder, the appellants cannot be punished for them [6].

The Court found that treachery attended the commission of the crimes because the victims were squatting or prostrate, unarmed, and unable to defend themselves when shot [7]. However, the Information filed was only for "attempted robbery in an inhabited house with homicide and frustrated homicide" [6]. Since the element of robbery was not proven (money and goods were intact), the complex crime charged failed [4].

Under the rules of criminal procedure, an accused cannot be convicted of a crime higher than that alleged in the Information [8]. Even if the evidence showed acts constituting Murder (qualified by treachery), the Information did not charge Murder. Therefore, the appellants can only be held guilty of the lesser offenses of Homicide and Frustrated Homicide, with treachery treated merely as a generic aggravating circumstance [6].

**Disposition:** The appealed decision is MODIFIED. Both appellants are found guilty of Homicide and Frustrated Homicide, aggravated by treachery [9].
