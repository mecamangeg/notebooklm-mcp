I. CAPTION
BENGUET CONSOLIDATED, INC. v. SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-19254, March 31, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Lamberto Foroson, an employee of petitioner Benguet Consolidated, Inc., suffered an injury on September 3, 1960, preventing him from working until October 8, 1960 [1]. Petitioner paid Foroson disability benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act (WCA) [1]. Subsequently, the respondent Social Security System (SSS) demanded that petitioner also pay Foroson sickness benefits under the Social Security Act for the same period [1, 2]. Petitioner objected, arguing that Section 5 of the WCA excludes other rights and remedies against the employer for the same injury, and that paying 20% of the social security benefits (as required by law) would constitute double payment for the same disability [2]. The Social Security Commission dismissed the petition and ordered petitioner to pay the sickness benefits [3]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N sickness benefits under the Social Security Act may be recovered simultaneously with disability benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act [4].

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the resolution of the Social Security Commission [5].

The Court held that the two benefits are distinct and separate [6]. While the original Social Security Act (R.A. No. 1161) barred recovery of social security benefits if the disability was compensable under the WCA, subsequent amendments (R.A. No. 1792 and R.A. No. 2658) deleted this prohibition [6-8]. This legislative history indicates an intent to allow simultaneous recovery [9].

Philosophically, WCA benefits are a burden on the industry for work-related hazards, acting as indemnity for injury [5, 9]. In contrast, Social Security benefits are paid to members as a matter of right from a common fund to which they contribute, providing assistance during work stoppage regardless of the cause [9, 10].

Regarding Section 5 of the WCA, the prohibition against double recovery applies to recovery *against the same employer* for the same injury [11]. Social Security benefits are recovered from the System, not the employer [11]. Although the employer advances the payment and absorbs 20% of the cost (while reimbursed 80% by the System), this 20% is an administrative expense to preclude fraudulent claims, not compensation for the injury itself [11].

**Disposition:** Resolution affirmed [5].
