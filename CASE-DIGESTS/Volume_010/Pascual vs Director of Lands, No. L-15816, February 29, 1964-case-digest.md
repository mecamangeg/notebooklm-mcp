I. CAPTION
EDUARDO E. PASCUAL v. DIRECTOR OF LANDS and SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, G.R. No. L-15816, February 29, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Valente Ramos leased Lots 672 and 674 of the Cadastral Survey of Ramos, Tarlac from the government. On June 22, 1954, Eduardo Pascual filed a petition with the Director of Lands to cancel the lease under Section 102 of Commonwealth Act No. 141. Pascual alleged that Ramos failed to pay rentals and taxes for several years and failed to cultivate the land [1].

The Director of Lands cancelled the lease due to delinquency in payments but denied Pascual the preferential right of entry. The Director ruled that the lease would have been cancelled *motu proprio* irrespective of Pascual's petition because the delinquency was of public record, and noted that Pascual was not the actual occupant of the land [2]. Pascual appealed to the Office of the President, which dismissed his appeal, affirming that preferential rights favor actual occupants [3, 4]. Pascual then filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Tarlac. The CFI reversed the administrative decisions and declared Pascual entitled to the rights under Section 102 [5]. The Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Pascual is entitled to a preferential right of entry under Section 102 of Commonwealth Act No. 141.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that the contemporaneous interpretation given by administrative officials to a law they are duty-bound to enforce deserves great weight and should be followed unless clearly erroneous [7].

The administrative officials correctly ruled that Pascual was not entitled to a preferential right because he was not the actual occupant of the land. The purpose of the law invoked by Pascual is to give priority or preference to the actual occupant [7]. Furthermore, where the delinquency in the payment of rents and taxes is of public record and the lease could have been cancelled *motu proprio* by the Director of Lands, an oppositor who merely calls attention to such delinquency but is not an occupant is not entitled to any prior right of entry [8].

The decision appealed from is reversed, and the complaint filed in the lower court is dismissed [9].
