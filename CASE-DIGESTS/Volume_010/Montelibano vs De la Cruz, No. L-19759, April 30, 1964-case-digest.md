I. CAPTION
CONCEPCION MONTELIBANO, assisted by her husband MATIAS HOJILIA, and ALFREDO L. MONTELIBANO v. HON. JOSE S. DE LA CRUZ, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, THE REGISTER OF DEEDS of the Province of Negros Occidental, and ALFREDO M. MONTELIBANO, G.R. No. L-19759, April 30, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On March 12, 1957, petitioners Concepcion and Alfredo L. Montelibano filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 4274) against respondent Alfredo M. Montelibano to annul a 1931 project of partition of their ancestors' estates or, alternatively, to recover specific shares and damages [1]. Petitioners caused a notice of *lis pendens* to be annotated on all certificates of title covering the properties adjudicated to the respondent in said partition [1, 2].

On October 9, 1958, respondent moved to cancel the notice of *lis pendens* specifically regarding the titles covering "Hacienda Binitin," arguing that the remaining properties subject to the notice were sufficient to secure the petitioners' alleged rights [2]. Judge De la Cruz granted the motion on October 22, 1958 [2]. After their motion for reconsideration was denied, petitioners filed this petition for certiorari, alleging grave abuse of discretion [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial judge committed grave abuse of discretion in cancelling the notice of *lis pendens* on specific properties.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the lower court did not abuse its discretion. The records showed that there were other properties of the respondent subject to the notice of *lis pendens* which were sufficient to protect the petitioners' alleged rights, should they eventually prevail [3, 4]. Furthermore, the evidence introduced by the petitioners during the intervening period was not sufficient to convince the respondent judge that their cause of action was meritorious enough to warrant a reconsideration of the cancellation order [5].

The writ prayed for is denied and the petition is dismissed [6].
