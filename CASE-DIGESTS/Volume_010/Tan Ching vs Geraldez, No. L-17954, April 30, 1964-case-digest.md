I. CAPTION
TAN CHING v. THE HON. A. GERALDEZ, Judge of the Municipal Court of the City of Manila, MACARIO OFILADA, Sheriff of Manila, and LAO KONG HING, G.R. No. L-17954, April 30, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On March 22, 1955, the Municipal Court of Manila rendered a judgment in an ejectment case ordering Tan Ching to vacate a premises and pay rentals to Lao Kong Hing [1]. The judgment became final but was not executed; Tan Ching remained in the premises and continued paying rentals for over three years [1, 2]. On December 20, 1958, Lao Kong Hing moved for execution, and a writ was issued [3]. Tan Ching filed a Certiorari petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, arguing the 1955 judgment was no longer enforceable due to implied novation and the expiration of Lao Kong Hing's own lease [4, 5]. The CFI ruled in favor of Tan Ching, setting aside the writ of execution [6]. Lao Kong Hing filed a Notice of Appeal on June 6, 1960, which was six days late [7, 8]. He attributed the delay to "excusable negligence," claiming he failed to see his lawyer due to his wife's difficult childbirth and a lack of funds [8, 9]. The CFI denied the appeal and the subsequent Petition for Relief from Judgment [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the failure to perfect the appeal within the reglementary period was due to excusable negligence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the delay was not excusable. The client and attorney knew each other's addresses, and if the client could not pay the expenses, the counsel could have requested an extension from the lower court [10]. The Court emphasized that the perfection of an appeal within the period laid down by law is "mandatory and jurisdictional" [11]. Failure to strictly comply renders the judgment final and executory and deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction to entertain the appeal [11, 12]. The Order appealed from was affirmed [13].
