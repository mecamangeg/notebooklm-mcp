I. CAPTION
CEBU PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and ULDARICO DE LOS REYES, G.R. No. L-19164, February 29, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Uldarico de los Reyes, a former employee of petitioner Cebu Portland Cement Company, contracted pulmonary tuberculosis due to the nature of his work. He was retired from service in 1950. In a decision dated May 26, 1959, the Hearing Officer found his illness compensable and ordered the petitioner to pay disability compensation and medical expenses incurred up to August 30, 1958. The petitioner satisfied this judgment. Subsequently, de los Reyes filed a new claim for reimbursement of medical expenses amounting to P3,821.46 incurred from September 1, 1958, to December 31, 1959, as his tuberculosis had not yet been arrested. The Hearing Officer ordered the reimbursement, which the Workmen's Compensation Commission affirmed. The petitioner appealed, questioning its liability for further medical expenses after having already paid the amounts awarded in the previous final decision.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the employer is liable for medical expenses incurred by the employee after the payment of the initial disability and medical compensation, for as long as the work-connected illness has not been cured.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of the Commission. Under Section 13 of the Workmen's Compensation Law (Act 3428), the employer is obligated to provide medical, surgical, and hospital services "as the nature of the injury or sickness may require." The Court reasoned that unlike the provisions relating to disability compensation (wage-loss), which are limited in both amount and duration, the law does not provide a maximum amount or time limit for medical attendance. Consequently, the employer's obligation to pay for necessary medical expenses subsists until the work-connected illness ceases. The employee's right to such assistance can only be impugned if they voluntarily refuse or obstruct medical services, which was not the case here.

The petition was denied, and the order appealed from was affirmed.
