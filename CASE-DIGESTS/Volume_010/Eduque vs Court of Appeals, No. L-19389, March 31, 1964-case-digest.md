I. CAPTION
VALENTIN EDUQUE v. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS and SY YEN, G.R. No. L-19389, March 31, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Sy Yen leased a building in Manila from Petitioner Valentin Eduque. Sy Yen later filed an action to recover costs for repairs and improvements he allegedly introduced to the building. Eduque was granted extensions to file his answer until February 1, 1960, but failed to do so. Consequently, the trial court declared him in default on February 6, 1960. Eduque filed his answer on February 12 and a motion to set aside the order of default on February 15.

Eduque's counsel argued his failure to answer was due to excusable negligence: his wife underwent a caesarian section on January 25, 1960, and subsequently developed serious complications requiring his constant personal attention. The trial court denied the motion, ruling the counsel could have asked for another extension or hired another lawyer. Sy Yen was allowed to present evidence *ex parte*, and the court rendered judgment ordering Eduque to pay for the improvements. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, citing *Gaerlan v. Bernal* to support the denial of the motion to set aside default.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the order of default should be set aside on the ground of excusable negligence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the failure to file the answer was due to excusable negligence. The record showed that the counsel’s wife suffered from high blood pressure and fever following her caesarian operation, compelling the counsel to attend to her personally [1, 2]. The Court distinguished this case from *Gaerlan v. Bernal*, noting that unlike the lawyer in *Gaerlan*, Eduque’s counsel did not have partners or companions in his law office to assist him [3].

Furthermore, Eduque successfully established that he had a meritorious defense. The lease contract attached to his answer expressly stipulated that no improvement should be undertaken without the landlord's written consent, and even if permitted, such improvements "shall be for the sole account of the Tenant" [4].

The decision of the Court of Appeals and the Court of First Instance were set aside, and the case was remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings [5].
