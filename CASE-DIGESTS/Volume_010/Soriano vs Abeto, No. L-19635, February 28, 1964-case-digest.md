I. CAPTION
TOMAS Q. SORIANO v. TEOFILO ABETO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19635, February 28, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tomas Q. Soriano secured a favorable decision from the Court of First Instance of Rizal on February 4, 1960 [1]. Respondents Abeto and Unson appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA) but repeatedly failed to comply with procedural deadlines [1, 2]. They failed to pay the printing costs for the record on appeal despite multiple extensions, causing the CA to dismiss the appeal twice (November 22, 1960 and February 17, 1961), only to reinstate it upon respondents' motions for reconsideration [3-5]. Subsequently, respondents failed to file their brief within the reglementary period [6, 7]. The CA dismissed the appeal for the third time on January 2, 1962, but again granted respondents' motion for reconsideration and reinstated the appeal on February 9, 1962 [7, 8]. Soriano filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition, arguing the CA abused its discretion [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion in reinstating the respondents' appeal after multiple dismissals and delays.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the respondents' conduct constituted a deliberate violation of the Rules of Court intended to stretch the periods and delay the appeal as much as possible [2, 10]. The Court cited specific circumstances proving this intent: (1) none of the motions for extension or reinstatement were supported by oath; (2) respondents failed to submit proofs of the truth of their alleged excuses; (3) they waited until the last day before dismissal orders became final to move for reconsideration; and (4) their petitions for delay were rarely filed before the expiration of the granted periods [2, 11]. The Court held that the CA's "unwonted magnanimity" in repeatedly reinstating the appeal despite these violations amounted to abuse of discretion and erased the boundary between benevolence and partiality [10]. The writs were granted, the CA resolutions set aside, and the respondents' appeal was ordered dismissed [12].
