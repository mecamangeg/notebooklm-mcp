I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PLACIDO SUSANO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19098, March 31, 1964, Concepcion, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On May 22, 1959, between 10:00 and 11:00 p.m., intruders broke into the house of Gregorio Vergara and Victoria Rivera in Caloocan, Rizal [3]. The malefactors beat the couple and fired a gun, causing Victoria to lose consciousness and killing Gregorio, who died from intracranial and traumatic hemorrhage [3, 4]. Cash and jewelry were also taken [3]. Placido Susano was subsequently charged with robbery with homicide and less serious physical injuries [4]. Prosecution witnesses, including the victim's wife and a neighbor, Antonio Zuñiga, positively identified Susano [5, 6]. Susano raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was in Bulacan eloping with Mercedes Marcos at the time of the crime [7]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal convicted Susano and sentenced him to the extreme penalty of death and to pay indemnity [2]. Susano appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over positive identification by eyewitnesses. [6, 8]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The defense of alibi cannot merit credence when the witnesses supporting it have a clear interest in the fate of the accused—such as his wife, mother-in-law, and relative—and where the accused's presence and participation have been established by positive eyewitness testimony [6, 8]. The Court found the positive identification by the victims and neighbors to be sufficient to overcome the alibi [6]. Due to the lack of the requisite number of votes for the death penalty, the Supreme Court **AFFIRMED** the conviction but **MODIFIED** the sentence, commuting the penalty to life imprisonment [6].
