**I. CAPTION**
COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION v. HON. HONORIO ROMERO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Davao, and TE SUAT ENG @ TAI SHUET YING, G.R. No. L-19782, January 31, 1964, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
On April 25, 1961, respondent Te Suat Eng filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus against the Commissioner of Immigration in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao to enjoin her arrest and declare her a Filipino citizen [1]. The Commissioner failed to answer and was declared in default [2]. On August 21, 1961, the CFI rendered a decision declaring Te Suat Eng a Filipino citizen [2]. The Commissioner’s motion for reconsideration was denied, leading him to file a notice of appeal on February 1, 1962 [3, 4].

On February 10, 1962, the CFI issued an order allowing the appeal, stating it had been perfected in due time [4]. However, upon Te Suat Eng’s motion arguing that a party in default has no right to appeal, the CFI issued a new order on March 19, 1962, setting aside the February 10 order and striking out the notice of appeal [5]. The Commissioner filed the present petition for mandamus to compel the judge to give due course to the appeal, arguing the trial court had already lost jurisdiction [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the trial court had jurisdiction to dismiss the appeal after the notice of appeal had been filed.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court had lost jurisdiction over the case. Since the underlying case was a special civil action (mandamus and prohibition), no record on appeal was required under Section 17, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court [7]. Furthermore, because the appellant was the Solicitor General representing the government, no appeal bond was necessary [7]. Consequently, the appeal was perfected upon the mere filing of the notice of appeal [7].

Under Section 9, Rule 41, once an appeal is perfected, the trial court loses jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case, retaining only the power to issue orders for the protection and preservation of the rights of the parties not involved in the appeal [8, 9]. Since the appeal was already perfected when the CFI issued the order of March 19, 1962, the court lacked the authority to recall the appeal or strike out the notice [10]. The Supreme Court set aside the order and directed the respondent Judge to give due course to the appeal [11].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justice Dizon concurred in the result only [12].
