I. CAPTION
NIEVES VDA. DE MIRANDA, ETC., ET AL. v. LIM SHI, G.R. No. L-18494, December 24, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-lessors Vda. de Miranda and her children leased a parcel of land in Zamboanga City to defendant-lessee Lim Shi for a period of ten (10) years starting January 18, 1949. The contract provided that upon expiration, the lessee would have the "preference to continue renting" the building, with the rent to be "determined anew" based on current rates.

Upon the contract's expiration in 1959, Lim Shi proposed a renewal for another ten years at an increased monthly rental of P750.00. The lessors accepted the rental rate but rejected the ten-year term, offering instead a one-year concession. Lim Shi refused, arguing that under the contract, only the rent needed determination, implying the renewal period should follow the original ten-year term. He consigned the rental payments in court. The lessors filed an action for specific performance to compel the one-year lease. The Court of First Instance ruled that since there was no agreement on the period, the tacit renewal was on a month-to-month basis. Both parties appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the tacit renewal of the lease contract should be for a period equal to the original term of ten years.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the tacit renewal is not for the same term as the original contract.

The Court reasoned that the original lease had expired, and the provision granting preference to the lessee was silent regarding the duration of the renewal. Citing *Gonzalez v. Crisanto*, the Court ruled that when a tenant holds over with the landlord's acquiescence, the tacit renewal is not for the original term but is determined by the periods of payment. Since the parties failed to agree on a specific period (ten years vs. one year) but the lessors accepted the monthly rental of P750.00, the implied renewed contract is on a month-to-month basis. This is consistent with the principle that if no fixed term is agreed upon and rent is paid monthly, the lease is month-to-month and terminable with due notice (*Villaroman v. Techico*; *Ottofy v. Dunn*).

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Concepcion, J. (Concurring):** Noted that under the contract, the lessee is given only a "preference" and not a right to renewal; thus, he cannot demand that the new lease be for the same period as the original term.
