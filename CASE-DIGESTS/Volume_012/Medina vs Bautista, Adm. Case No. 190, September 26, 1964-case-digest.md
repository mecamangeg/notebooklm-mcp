I. CAPTION
MARCOS MEDINA v. LORETO U. BAUTISTA, Adm. Case No. 190, September 26, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
In 1953, Maria Ragsac Cabel filed a reconveyance suit against complainant Marcos Medina. Medina sought a compromise through Cabel's lawyer, respondent Atty. Loreto U. Bautista. Respondent demanded money from Medina and promised to file a motion for extension of time for Medina to answer, but instead filed a motion to declare Medina in default [1, 2]. Consequently, the trial court allowed Cabel to repurchase the property for P1,200.00 [2].

Respondent subsequently prepared two fictitious deeds of sale: one appearing that Cabel sold the land to Medina for P8,000.00 (which she never received), and another where Medina reconveyed it to Cabel for P1,200.00 [3, 4]. Furthermore, Cabel entrusted respondent with P800.00 to deposit in court for the repurchase, but respondent misappropriated the funds [4, 5]. Respondent was later convicted of *estafa* by the Court of Appeals [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N respondent should be disbarred for malpractice and conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that respondent's acts—specifically preparing fictitious deeds of sale, deceiving the complainant leading to a default order, and misappropriating funds entrusted to him for court deposit—constitute malpractice and conduct unbecoming a member of the bar [4]. Additionally, the Court ruled that the crime of *estafa* involves moral turpitude within the purview of Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court [7]. Lawyers are exacted a high degree of fidelity and must be scrupulously careful in handling money entrusted to them; respondent violated this trust [6].

Respondent Loreto U. Bautista is **DISBARRED** and his name is ordered stricken off from the roll of attorneys [7].
