I. CAPTION
CENTRAL AZUCARERA DON PEDRO v. ELIAS AGNO and WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-20424, October 22, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Elias Agno was employed by petitioner Central Azucarera Don Pedro starting in 1927, eventually becoming a head mechanic in the centrifugating department [1]. His duties involved overhauling machines, lifting heavy parts, and working in very warm conditions [2]. Agno stopped working on January 30, 1959, and on April 16, 1959, the petitioner’s physician diagnosed him with moderately advanced tuberculosis [1]. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) ruled in favor of Agno, awarding P4,000.00 in disability benefits, medical expenses, and attorney’s fees [3, 4]. Petitioner appealed, arguing there was no evidence the illness was work-connected, that Agno was not totally disabled, and that the award of attorney's fees was improper as it was not prayed for [5-7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Agno's illness is compensable.
2. W/N Agno is totally disabled.
3. W/N the WCC can award attorney’s fees *motu proprio*.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The statutory presumption is that a claim is compensable unless the employer proves the contrary [5]. The WCC's finding that the illness was traceable to working conditions can be inferred from established facts and is not arbitrary [5]. Petitioner failed to present adequate evidence that Agno was free from tuberculosis when he ceased working or that the disease could have progressed to such an advanced stage between his resignation and the diagnosis months later [5, 6].

2. **YES.** While a man with advanced tuberculosis may physically be able to work, he cannot do so and still recover from the disease [8]. The burden of proof lies with the employer to establish how much work the laborer can perform without detriment to his health, which petitioner failed to do [8]. Denying total disability benefits on the assumption he could still work would be an insistence to "extract the last ounce of energy from a sick man" [8].

3. **NO.** Neither Section 6, Rule 26 of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission Rules nor Article 2208 of the Civil Code grants the Commission authority to award attorney’s fees *motu proprio* (on its own initiative) [9]. In this case, there was no prayer for such fees nor evidence justifying the amount awarded [7].

**Decision affirmed with modification** (award of attorney’s fees is deleted) [9].
