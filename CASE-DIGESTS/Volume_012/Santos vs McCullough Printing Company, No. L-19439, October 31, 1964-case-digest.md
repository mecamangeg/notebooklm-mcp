I. CAPTION
MAURO MALANG SANTOS v. McCULLOUGH PRINTING COMPANY, G.R. No. L-19439, October 31, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Mauro Malang Santos created an artistic design depicting a Philippine rural Christmas scene for the personal Christmas cards of former Ambassador Felino Neri in 1959 [1, 2]. Ambassador Neri had 800 copies printed by defendant McCullough Printing Company and distributed them to his friends [3]. The following year, 1960, McCullough displayed Santos' design in its album of commercial samples and sold reprints to other clients (Sampaguita Pictures and Raul Urra & Co.) without the knowledge or authority of Santos [2, 3]. Santos filed an action for damages based on Articles 721 and 722 of the Civil Code, alleging unauthorized use of his intellectual creation [1]. The parties stipulated that the design was not copyrighted [4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that the failure to copyright the work rendered it public property upon publication [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N plaintiff is entitled to copyright protection under the Civil Code despite the lack of registration and the prior distribution of his design.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the plaintiff is not entitled to protection. Under the applicable Patent Office Administrative Order No. 3, an intellectual creation must be copyrighted within 30 days of its publication (if made in Manila) or 60 days (if made elsewhere); failure to do so renders the creation public property [6].

The Court rejected the argument that the distribution by Ambassador Neri was a "limited publication." For a publication to be considered limited, such prohibition or limitation must appear on the face of the design [6]. Since Neri distributed 800 copies without any indication of a limited purpose, the effect was a general publication, causing the rights to the design to become vested in the general public [6].

While an author has an exclusive right to the *first* publication of his work, this right is lost once the work is published and dedicated to the public, unless placed under the protection of the Copyright Law [6]. Since Santos failed to copyright the design, he lost the exclusive right to control subsequent publications [6].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed [7].
