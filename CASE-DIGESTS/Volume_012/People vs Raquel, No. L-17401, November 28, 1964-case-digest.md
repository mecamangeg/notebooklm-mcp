I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SANTIAGO RAQUEL, G.R. No. L-17401, November 28, 1964, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of June 1, 1959, in Barrio Tinambacan, Jaro, Leyte, Francisco Dador was having supper when he was shot from behind. His wife, Julita Arboso, immediately took a flashlight to seek help from the police. On her way out, she saw the accused, Santiago Raquel, aiming a gun at her and telling her that her husband would not live. She returned to her husband, identifying Raquel, and the victim confirmed this, citing a previous threat regarding a testimony in another case. Dador died on July 3, 1959.

The Court of First Instance of Leyte convicted Raquel of murder and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*. Raquel appealed, arguing that the wife's testimony was incredible because her natural reaction should have been to comfort her husband rather than seek police help. He also interposed the defense of alibi, claiming he was in the poblacion delivering coconuts at the time of the incident.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the witness testimony is credible despite the alleged "unnatural" behavior of seeking police help instead of attending to the victim.
2. W/N the defense of alibi acts as a valid defense.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court rejected the contention that the wife's act of seeking police help was unnatural or incredible. The Court reasoned that "different persons respond to crises differently" and the impulse to call the police is quite natural [1, 2]. The Court further noted that history is full of instances of valor and courage by women, such as those in the Katipunan, debunking the appellant's view that such acts are incredible for a woman [1, 3]. The witness positively identified the accused, and there was no motive for her to falsely impute the crime [4, 5].

2. **NO.** The defense of alibi was rejected because the accused's own witness testified that the distance between the crime scene and the alleged location of the accused was only about 4 1/2 kilometers [6, 7]. Thus, it was not physically impossible for the accused to be at the scene of the crime [8].

The killing was qualified by treachery as the victim was shot from behind at night while eating [9]. The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the indemnity is raised from P5,000.00 to P6,000.00 [9].
