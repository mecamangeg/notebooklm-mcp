I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ESTEBAN R. CHAVES, G.R. No. L-19521, October 30, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In January 1948, Esteban Chaves collected a claim of $4,252.20 in death benefits for Marcela Rambuyon but retained P5,362.20 for himself, delivering only a portion to the claimant [1]. He was convicted of violating Republic Act No. 145 and sentenced to imprisonmnent and to indemnify the offended party the sum of P5,362.20; this judgment became final on April 16, 1961 [1].

When a writ of execution was issued in May 1961, the Sheriff levied on Chaves' residential lot and building [2]. Chaves claimed the property was exempt from execution, having been extrajudicially constituted as a "family home" on December 5, 1953—after the filing of the information but before his conviction [2]. The Court of First Instance ruled that the family home was not exempt because the obligation was anterior to its constitution [2, 3]. Chaves appealed, arguing that the indemnity only became a "debt" upon the 1961 judgment, which was after the family home was established [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the family home is exempt from execution for an indemnity obligation arising from a crime committed before the home's constitution but judicially adjudicated after.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order, ruling that the property is not exempt [5].

Under **Article 243(2) of the Civil Code**, an extrajudicially formed family home is not exempt from execution for "debts incurred before the declaration was recorded in the Registry of Property" [4]. The Court held that the term "debt" in this provision is used in its generic sense to mean "obligations" in general, citing *Montoya vs. Ignacio* [6]. Chaves' duty to reimburse the misappropriated funds arose in January 1948, the date of the misappropriation, and not in 1961 when the judgment was rendered [6]. The judgment merely established the fact of the obligation beyond controversy but was not the source of the duty to pay [6]. Furthermore, humane considerations regarding the family home do not intend to enable a debtor to escape payment of just debts incurred prior to the home's constitution [7].

Order affirmed [5].
