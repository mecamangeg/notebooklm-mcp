I. CAPTION
FERNANDO A. FROILAN v. PAN ORIENTAL SHIPPING COMPANY, REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, and COMPAÑIA MARITIMA, G.R. No. L-11897, October 31, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Fernando Froilan purchased a vessel from the Shipping Administration, securing the unpaid balance with a mortgage on the vessel [1]. The contract stipulated that the Administration could rescind the contract and repossess the vessel in case of default [2]. Froilan defaulted on installments and insurance payments [3]. Consequently, the Administration rescinded the contract, repossessed the vessel, and re-registered the title in the government's name [4, 5]. The Administration then entered into a bareboat charter with option to purchase with Pan Oriental Shipping Co. [6, 7]. Later, the Cabinet resolved to restore Froilan's rights, and Froilan paid his outstanding accounts [8, 9]. When Pan Oriental refused to surrender the vessel, claiming it had exercised its option to purchase, Froilan filed a replevin suit. The lower court ruled in favor of Froilan, holding that the extrajudicial rescission was invalid and that judicial action was necessary to cancel the contract [10]. Pan Oriental appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Shipping Administration could validly rescind the contract of sale without judicial action.
2. W/N Pan Oriental has a superior right to the vessel based on its charter and option to purchase.
3. W/N Pan Oriental is entitled to reimbursement for expenses incurred on the vessel.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Article 1191 of the Civil Code, nothing prohibits parties from entering into an agreement that violation of the terms of the contract would cause cancellation thereof, even without court intervention [11]. Judicial action is only needed where there is an absence of a special provision in the contract granting the right of rescission [11]. Here, the contract expressly provided that the Administration may rescind as it saw fit in case of breach, and Froilan had expressly waived his rights and agreed to automatic forfeiture upon his failure to file a bond [12].

2. **NO.** Pan Oriental's charter contract contained a specific requirement for approval by the President, which was never obtained; the letter from the Executive Secretary was not an act of the President [13, 14]. While the Cabinet's restoration of Froilan was also merely recommendatory, the Shipping Administration practically ratified the contract with Froilan by accepting full payment of the purchase price [15]. Pan Oriental, lacking a valid contract, has no capacity to question this ratification [15].

3. **YES.** Pan Oriental was not a possessor in bad faith until the institution of the case [15]. Having incurred useful and necessary expenses on the vessel, Pan Oriental is entitled to a refund and the right of retention until reimbursed, pursuant to Article 546 of the Civil Code [15].

The decision is **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**, and the case is remanded to the lower court for the determination of expenses [16].
