I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ALFONSO CAÑADA, G.R. No. L-19132, September 26, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
The accused, Alfonso Cañada, was a suitor of Nena Decena but was rejected. Cañada harbored resentment against the victim, Felicito Escobido (Nena’s uncle), believing that Escobido’s opposition was the cause of his rejection [1, 2]. On the night of December 7, 1958, in Gumaca, Quezon, Cañada and Escobido had a drinking spree [3]. Cañada subsequently invited Escobido to go serenading, and they left together [3]. Escobido did not return, and his body was found the next morning on railroad tracks near the house where Cañada claimed to have slept [4]. The victim sustained multiple wounds, including a severed hand [5]. Police found Cañada’s fountain pen three meters away from the corpse [3, 6]. There were no eyewitnesses to the actual killing [3]. The Court of First Instance of Quezon convicted Cañada of murder based on circumstantial evidence and sentenced him to life imprisonment [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N circumstantial evidence is sufficient to convict the accused of the killing.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but modified the crime from Murder to **Homicide**.

The Court held that while there was no direct evidence pointing to the accused, the circumstantial evidence presented constituted an unbroken chain sufficient to produce a conviction. The Court highlighted the following circumstances: (1) the accused had a motive (resentment over the rejected courtship); (2) he was the last person seen with the deceased; (3) the body was found near the place where the accused slept; and (4) the accused's fountain pen was found near the victim's body [2, 4, 8]. These facts proved that the accused was the only person with sufficient motive and opportunity to commit the crime [2].

However, the Court ruled that the crime committed was only **Homicide**, not Murder, because the prosecution failed to prove any qualifying circumstance (such as treachery or evident premeditation) [9].

**Disposition:** Decision AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The accused is found guilty of Homicide and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 6 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 20 years of *reclusion temporal* [9].
