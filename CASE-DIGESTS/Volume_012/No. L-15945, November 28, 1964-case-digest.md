I. CAPTION
PORFIRIO VILLAMOR, ET AL. v. THE HON. ARSENIO H. LACSON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15945, November 28, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, employees of the City of Manila, were found guilty of violating office regulations and were dismissed by respondent Mayor Lacson, ceasing work on August 6, 1956 [1], [2]. Upon appeal, the Office of the President affirmed the finding of guilt but modified the penalty, ruling that the suspension of over one year already suffered was sufficient punishment, and ordered their reinstatement [3]. Petitioners were reinstated on January 15, 1958 [4]. They subsequently demanded payment of salaries for the period they were out of service, arguing that under Section 695 of the Administrative Code, preventive suspension is limited to two months, and they were entitled to pay for the period exceeding that limit [4]. The claim was denied. Petitioners filed a petition for *Mandamus* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila and moved for judgment on the pleadings [4], [5]. The CFI dismissed the case, ruling that by moving for judgment on the pleadings, petitioners admitted the respondents' defense that the period out of service was a disciplinary penalty, not a preventive suspension [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioners admitted the material allegations of the respondents by moving for judgment on the pleadings.
2. W/N the petitioners are entitled to back wages for the period they were out of service.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that a party who prays for judgment on the pleadings without offering proof as to the truth of their own allegations, and without giving the opposing party an opportunity to introduce evidence, is understood to admit the truth of all material and relevant allegations of the opposing party [7]. Consequently, petitioners were deemed to have admitted the respondents' defense that the period in question was a penalty and not merely preventive suspension [8].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the Mayor had the authority to dismiss the employees. The modification by the Office of the President, which substituted the period out of service for dismissal, did not convert the penalty into a preventive suspension governed by Section 695 of the Administrative Code [8]. The decision did not exonerate the petitioners but merely mitigated the penalty [9]. The general proposition is "As you work, so shall you earn"; a public official is not entitled to compensation if he has not rendered service [9]. Payment of withheld salaries requires a showing that the suspension was unjustified or the employee was innocent (*Reyes v. Hernandez*) [9]. Since petitioners were found guilty and the suspension was a penalty, they had no clear legal right to back wages, and the petition for *Mandamus* was properly denied [10].

The decision dismissing the case was **AFFIRMED** [10].
