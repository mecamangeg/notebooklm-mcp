I. CAPTION
BALONG CALSE v. PINKISAN YADNO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19652, December 29, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On December 1, 1960, petitioner Balong Calse filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Baguio City to reopen the Baguio Townsite Reservation case (Civil Res. Case No. 1) under Republic Act No. 931 [1]. He sought to register Lots 1, 2, and 3, claiming that he and his predecessors had been in open, continuous, and adverse possession for over 60 years and had paid taxes for 42 years [2]. He alleged that they were never notified of the 1922 hearings that declared the lands part of the public domain [2]. During the trial, while Calse (then 95 years old and uneducated) was testifying, he admitted knowing of the reservation case in 1922 but did nothing because no one adversely claimed his land [3, 4]. Based solely on this incomplete testimony, the trial court dismissed the petition, ruling that his admission constituted a waiver and disqualified him from availing of the benefits of R.A. 931 [3]. Calse appealed the dismissal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is disqualified from reopening cadastral proceedings under R.A. No. 931 based on his admission of knowledge regarding the original proceedings.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court acted hastily in dismissing the petition. R.A. No. 931 grants the right to reopen proceedings to persons unable to file their claim for "some justifiable reason" [5]. The Court ruled that this phrase is broad and encompasses reasons beyond mere lack of knowledge of the case, such as poverty, lack of notice, sickness, and lack of schooling [6, 7]. The mere fact that the petitioner admitted knowing of the townsite reservation case does not automatically constitute a waiver of his rights, especially considering his advanced age, lack of education, and the ambiguity of his testimony regarding when exactly he acquired such knowledge [8, 9]. Due process demands that the petitioner be allowed to complete his testimony and substantiate his claims of lack of notice and continuous possession [7, 10].

The order appealed from is set aside, and the case is remanded to the court *a quo* for further proceedings [11].
