I. CAPTION
JOHN M. MILLER and EMILIO ESPINOSA, JR. v. THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, ANSELMO IRENEA, et al., G.R. No. L-16761, October 31, 1964, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
Applicants Miller and Espinosa applied for the registration of a parcel of land in Masbate [1]. Several private oppositors appeared verbally, and later, 28 of them filed written but unverified oppositions [1, 2]. The applicants proceeded to present their evidence and rested their case without objecting to the lack of verification [2, 3]. It was only after the private oppositors presented their first witness and the applicants' counsel had cross-examined him that the applicants moved to dismiss the opposition for failing to comply with the verification requirement under Section 34 of Act 496 [2, 4]. The trial court dismissed the unverified opposition despite the oppositors' offer to verify it [4]. The private oppositors appealed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the applicants waived the defect of lack of verification in the opposition.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the applicants failed to invoke the requirement of verification under Section 34 of Act 496 seasonably [3, 5]. An objection to a want of verification must be taken before trial [3]. By proceeding with the trial, presenting evidence, resting their case, and cross-examining the witness without objection, the applicants treated the pleading as verified and thus waived the defect [3, 6]. Citing *Malagum v. Pablo*, the Court also held that unverified oppositions are sufficient to confer standing in court upon oppositors, who may be allowed to verify them later [7].

The orders of the lower court were **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** for further proceedings [8].
