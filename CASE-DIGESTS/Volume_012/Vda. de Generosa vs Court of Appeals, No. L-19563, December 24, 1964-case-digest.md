I. CAPTION
TEODORA VILLALON VDA. DE GENEROSA v. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS and VICENTE NARDO, G.R. No. L-19563, December 24, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On August 3, 1944, respondent Vicente Nardo executed a deed of conditional sale of a parcel of land in favor of Juan Generosa for P1,500.00 in Japanese military notes [1]. The contract stipulated that the property could be redeemed within ten years, but expressly prohibited redemption within the first seven years; redemption was allowed only after the lapse of the seventh year (i.e., starting August 3, 1951) [1]. Nardo received additional sums totaling P3,500.00 in Japanese notes during the occupation and P240.00 in genuine Philippine currency after liberation [2].

In 1952, Nardo tendered P350.00 to redeem the property, arguing this was the equivalent value under the Ballantyne Scale [2]. Petitioner Vda. de Generosa rejected the tender, insisting that the obligation be settled on a peso-to-peso basis [2]. Nardo filed an action to compel the acceptance of the payment. The trial court ruled in favor of Nardo, applying the Ballantyne Scale, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Ballantyne Scale of values is applicable to the redemption price.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the Ballantyne Scale applies *only* when the obligation is payable during the Japanese occupation; otherwise, payment shall be due on a peso-to-peso basis [3, 4].

In this case, the contract expressly prohibited payment by Nardo until after the expiration of seven years from August 3, 1944, meaning the obligation to redeem fell due only after August 3, 1951 [3]. Since the obligation was payable after the occupation, Nardo is not entitled to the benefits of the Ballantyne Scale [4]. He must pay the redemption price fully in Philippine currency [4]. The Court relied on the doctrine established in *Roño vs. Gomez* and *Gomez vs. Tabia* [3].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is REVERSED, and Mrs. Generosa is ordered to execute the deed of reconveyance only upon payment of the sum of P3,740.00 in Philippine currency [5].
