I. CAPTION
PANGASINAN TRANSPORTATION CO., INC. (PANTRANCO) v. HON. GREGORIO A. LEGASPI, PUA PIAN, ROLLY PUA, AIDA PUA, GLORIA PUA, CHUA TECK AND CRISPINA BREGUERA, G.R. Nos. L-20916–17, December 23, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Pua Pian, et al. filed separate complaints (Civil Case Nos. A-247 and A-248) against petitioner Pangasinan Transportation Co., Inc. (Pantranco) for damages arising from a breach of contract of carriage. The complaints alleged that the respondents' relatives died when the Pantranco bus they were riding collided with another Pantranco bus due to the gross negligence of the driver. Respondents alleged that Pantranco was "financially well-established" and requested the trial court to order the production of the company's general ledgers and financial statements for 1959-1961 for inspection. Pantranco opposed the motion, arguing that its financial capacity was not in issue and the request constituted a "fishing expedition." Respondent Judge Legaspi granted the motion, ruling that financial capacity is relevant in determining the equitable amount of damages. Pantranco filed a petition for certiorari to annul the order.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the financial standing of a common carrier is material in an action for damages for breach of contract of carriage, thereby justifying the production of its financial records.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Under Rule 27 of the Revised Rules of Court, parties may request the production of documents that are not privileged and are material to any matter involved in the action. The Court held that evidence of the defendant’s financial standing is material in this case. Article 2206 of the Civil Code, applicable to breach of contract of carriage via Article 1764, fixes the minimum indemnity for death at P3,000 (at the time), but courts may increase this amount according to the circumstances. The Court relied on the principle in *Alcantara v. Surro* and Commonwealth Act No. 284, stating that in fixing a greater amount of indemnity, the court may consider the pecuniary situation of the party liable. If the carrier's financial ability allows, it should be made to pay more than the minimum if the circumstances of the case demand it. Thus, the production of financial documents was for a good cause and not an abuse of discretion.

The petition is dismissed and the writ of preliminary injunction is dissolved.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**J.B.L. Reyes (Concurring):** Concurred in the result but clarified that financial standing is irrelevant for compensatory or moral damages, which are strictly for indemnification. However, since the complaint expressly pleaded "gross negligence" and "wanton recklessness," the court may award exemplary or corrective damages (Arts. 2229, 2232, 2233). For exemplary damages, the defendant's pecuniary ability is relevant to determine the amount necessary to serve as an effective deterrent. He noted that Commonwealth Act No. 284 is no longer controlling under the new Civil Code regarding compensatory damages.
