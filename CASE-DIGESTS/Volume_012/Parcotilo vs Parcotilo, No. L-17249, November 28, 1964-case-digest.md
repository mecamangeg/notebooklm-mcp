I. CAPTION
LICOTEDRA PARCOTILO, et al. v. FILOMENA PARCOTILO, et al., G.R. No. L-17249, November 28, 1964, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Pablo Parcotilo and his wife Filomena Dipolog owned two parcels of land in Misamis Occidental. On July 20, 1917, the spouses executed a document (Exhibit "1") conveying their properties to their nephew, defendant Demetrio Parcotilo, in gratitude for his services. The spouses died in 1918. Demetrio immediately took possession of the lands, claiming ownership based on the 1917 document, and later transferred tax declarations to his name in 1936. That same year, he sold a portion of the land to defendant Crispin Prieto, who possessed it thereafter.

On January 23, 1956—thirty-eight years after the spouses' death—the plaintiffs (other nephews and nieces of Pablo) filed a complaint for partition, claiming co-ownership. They argued the 1917 document was invalid. The trial court dismissed the complaint, ruling that while the testament lacked the legal requisites of a valid will or donation *mortis causa*, it served as a basis for acquisitive prescription, which had already set in.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Demetrio Parcotilo acquired ownership over the lands by prescription despite the invalidity of the 1917 testament.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint.

The Court held that even if the 1917 document was not executed with all the requisites of a valid will or donation *mortis causa*, it supplied the basis for Demetrio's claim of ownership [1]. This adverse claim, coupled with his actual, open, continuous, and exclusive possession for a period of thirty-eight years (1918 to 1956), ripened into a full title by prescription [1].

Since the lands were unregistered and the rights accrued before the New Civil Code, the applicable law is **Section 41 of Act 190 (Code of Civil Procedure)**, which vests title after ten years of actual adverse possession [2]. Furthermore, even under **Article 1137 of the New Civil Code**, the defendant's possession satisfied the requirement for extraordinary prescription (thirty years of uninterrupted adverse possession), which applies regardless of title or good faith [3]. Consequently, the plaintiffs' claim for partition is barred.

The decision of the lower court is affirmed.
