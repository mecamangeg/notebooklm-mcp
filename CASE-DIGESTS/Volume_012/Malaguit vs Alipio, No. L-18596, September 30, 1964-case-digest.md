I. CAPTION
ALVAREZ MALAGUIT (MORO) v. FELIX ALIPIO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18596, September 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Alvarez Malaguit filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Basilan City to recover possession of portions of Lot No. 67, covered by Original Certificate of Title No. 10246. He claimed exclusive ownership of the land. The defendants, Felix Alipio et al., occupied various portions of the lot, claiming ownership based on purchases made from Alvarez’s five brothers and sisters.

The trial court found that Lot No. 67 was originally owned by Domingo Malaguit and was registered in 1927 in the names of his six children (including Alvarez) *pro-indiviso*. The evidence showed that Alvarez owned only 1/6 of the land, and his siblings had validly sold their respective shares to the defendants or their predecessors-in-interest. Alvarez contended that these sales were null and void because they lacked the approval of the Provincial Governor or Mayor as required by Sections 145 and 146 of the Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu, asserting that he and his siblings were Moros.

The CFI dismissed the complaint but ordered the registration of the specific portions occupied by the defendants in their names based on a subdivision plan submitted during the trial.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the sales of the land portions to the defendants are void for lack of approval by the Governor or Mayor under the Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu.
2. W/N the Court of First Instance, acting as an ordinary court, has jurisdiction to order the registration of the subdivided portions in the defendants' names.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the requirement of Sections 145 and 146 of the Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu regarding legal assistance and approval for transactions involves only "Moros or other non-Christian inhabitants." The evidence established that the sellers (the Malaguit siblings) were not Moros. Their father, Domingo Malaguit, was from Manila. Furthermore, the original decree of registration expressly identified the wives of the siblings as "Mora" but did not attach such description to the siblings themselves. The Court concluded they are Christians; thus, the administrative requirements for non-Christians do not apply to the sales in question [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the approval of a subdivision plan to serve as the basis for a decree of registration falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of a cadastral or registration court. The CFI, acting as an ordinary court in a recovery of possession case, cannot assume this jurisdiction. Petitions for such registration must be presented before the registration court under Section 112 of the Land Registration Act [3].

The decision was **MODIFIED**. The portion of the lower court's decision ordering the registration of the lots in the defendants' names was eliminated, but the decision was affirmed in all other respects (dismissal of the complaint) [4].
