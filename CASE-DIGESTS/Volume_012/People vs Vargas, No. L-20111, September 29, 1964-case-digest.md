I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DANILO E. VARGAS, G.R. No. L-20111, September 29, 1964, Paredes, J. [1] [2]

II. FACTS
On October 22, 1961, Danilo E. Vargas (17 years old) and a co-accused entered the Pasig Elementary School at night through a window and stole an adding machine and other items totaling P1,250.00 [2] [3]. They were unarmed during the commission of the crime [4]. Vargas initially pleaded not guilty but later changed his plea to guilty [5]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal convicted him of robbery and imposed an indeterminate sentence of 2 years and 4 months as minimum to 6 years of *prision correccional* as maximum [5]. Vargas moved for reconsideration, arguing that due to his minority and plea of guilty, the penalty should be reduced, but the motion was denied [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the penalty imposed by the trial court was correct considering the minority of the accused. [7]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court modified the penalty. Under Article 299 of the Revised Penal Code, robbery in a public building where the value exceeds 250 pesos and the offenders are unarmed is punished by *prision mayor* [7] [4]. However, since Vargas was a minor (17 years old) at the time of the offense, the penalty is reduced by one degree to *prision correccional* pursuant to Article 68 of the RPC [4]. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum period should be taken from the penalty next lower in degree, which is *arresto mayor* [4].

Accordingly, the decision was affirmed with modification, sentencing Vargas to an indeterminate penalty ranging from 6 months of *arresto mayor* to 3 years, 6 months, and 21 days of *prision correccional* [4] [8].
