I. CAPTION
FIDEL GERALDEZ, et al. v. HON. JOSE S. RODRIGUEZ, et al., G.R. No. L-17064, November 9, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On February 19, 1958, respondents Spouses Sarmiento and Canonigo filed an action for recovery of possession against petitioners (Geraldezes) in the Justice of the Peace Court of Naga, Cebu [1]. Respondents alleged that they owned the land and petitioners were their tenants who refused to deliver crop shares [1, 2]. Petitioners answered claiming they were the owners of the land by inheritance and raised the affirmative defense that the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter, whether it be tenancy or ownership [2].

The Justice of the Peace Court ruled in favor of respondents, ordering petitioners to vacate [3]. Petitioners appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu and moved to dismiss the case, arguing that under Rep. Act No. 1199, cases involving the ejectment of a tenant fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations [3]. Respondent Judge Rodriguez denied the motion. After trial, petitioners moved to dismiss again, but the Judge denied it, ruling that the real issue involved was ownership [4, 5]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance acquired jurisdiction over the case on appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Justice of the Peace Court had no jurisdiction over the case. If the issue was the ejectment of a tenant, jurisdiction lay with the Court of Agrarian Relations; if the issue was ownership (title), jurisdiction lay originally with the Court of First Instance [6]. Since the proceedings in the court of origin (Justice of the Peace) were void for lack of jurisdiction, the CFI could not exercise appellate jurisdiction over the case [6].

Furthermore, the CFI could not assume original jurisdiction under Rule 40, Section 11 of the Rules of Court because the petitioners did not consent to it [7]. Petitioners seasonably raised the issue of lack of jurisdiction in the lower court and twice in the CFI [7].

Petition granted; orders set aside [8].
