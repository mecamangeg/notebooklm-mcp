I. CAPTION
ILDEFONSO BRECINIO v. NICOLAS PAPICTA, Justice of the Peace, Pili, Camarines Sur, et al., G.R. No. L-20347, October 31, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Ildefonso Brecinio was accused in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Pili, Camarines Sur, of stealing a carabao worth P150.00 belonging to Teodolo Barientes [1]. Brecinio moved to dismiss the case, claiming that jurisdiction belonged to the Court of First Instance (CFI) because the penalty for the crime exceeded six months of imprisonment [1]. The JP Court denied the motion, asserting it had concurrent jurisdiction with the CFI [1]. Brecinio filed a petition for certiorari with the CFI of Camarines Sur, which was dismissed [1]. The CFI ruled that jurisdiction over the offense is concurrent, and since the JP Court took cognizance of the case first, it had the authority to try and decide it [1]. Brecinio appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Justice of the Peace Court has jurisdiction over a case of theft of large cattle where the value of the property does not exceed P200.00.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed that Justice of the Peace Courts have concurrent original jurisdiction with Courts of First Instance over criminal cases for theft of large cattle where the value of the property does not exceed P200.00 [3, 4]. Under Section 87(b) of the Judiciary Act (Republic Act No. 296), JP courts have jurisdiction over cases of larceny and theft involving amounts not exceeding P200.00, even if the penalty provided by law is imprisonment for more than six months [5, 6]. The Court applied the doctrine settled in *People v. Palmon*, *People v. Peñas*, and *People v. Colicio*, rejecting the appellant's reliance on *obiter* from the Court of Appeals [5, 7, 8]. As the JP Court acquired jurisdiction first, the dismissal of the certiorari petition was proper [1].

The order affirmed [9].
