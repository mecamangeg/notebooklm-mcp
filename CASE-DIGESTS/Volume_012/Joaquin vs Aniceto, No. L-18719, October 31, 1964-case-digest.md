I. CAPTION
PILAR JOAQUIN, ET AL. v. FELIX ANICETO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18719, October 31, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On April 27, 1960, Pilar Joaquin was injured when she was bumped by a taxicab driven by Felix Aniceto and owned by Ruperto Rodelas. Aniceto was charged with serious physical injuries through reckless imprudence and was convicted by the Municipal Court of Manila. He appealed the conviction to the Court of First Instance (CFI). While the criminal appeal was pending, Joaquin filed a separate civil action for damages against Aniceto and Rodelas based on the reservation she made in the criminal case.

During trial, Joaquin blocked Rodelas' attempt to prove the defense of "diligence of a good father of a family," arguing that the action was to enforce subsidiary civil liability arising from a crime under the Revised Penal Code, not quasi-delict. The trial court sustained the objection but dismissed the case, ruling that an action to enforce the employer’s subsidiary liability is premature without a final judgment of conviction against the driver. Joaquin appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the employer can be held subsidiarily liable for the employee's crime in a separate civil action while the criminal case against the employee is still pending.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that while an injured party may choose between an action for quasi-delict (where the employer is primarily liable subject to the defense of due diligence) and an action for civil liability arising from crime (Art. 100, Revised Penal Code), Joaquin chose the latter. Under Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code, the employer's liability is subsidiary.

The Court held that conviction of the employee is a condition *sine qua non* for the employer's subsidiary liability. While Article 33 of the Civil Code allows for an independent civil action against the *employee* for physical injuries distinct from the criminal action, it does not apply to the employer's *subsidiary* civil liability. Such liability is governed by the Penal Code. Consequently, any action brought against the employer before the final conviction of the employee is premature.

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
