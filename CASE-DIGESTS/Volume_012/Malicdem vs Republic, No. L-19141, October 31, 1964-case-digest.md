I. CAPTION
CHANGE OF NAME OF THE MINOR HENRY TOMELDEN, JUAN MALICDEM and SATURNINA AQUINO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19141, October 31, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Juan Malicdem and Saturnina Aquino filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan to change the name of the minor Henry Tomelden to Henry Malicdem [1]. They alleged that they are the legitimate parents of Henry, but due to a local belief aimed at breaking a chain of mortality among their children, Henry was "sold" to and registered as the son of Lope Tomelden and Eugenia Aquino, Saturnina’s sister [1]. The minor has lived with the petitioners since birth and recognizes them as his real parents [1]. The trial court, after hearing testimonies from the petitioners, the minor, and the registered mother Eugenia Aquino, found the minor to be the legitimate child of the Malicdems and granted the petition [2]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that testimonial evidence should not override the civil registry entry and that the proceeding was unnecessary if the child was truly legitimate [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N testimonial evidence can override an entry in the civil registry to justify a change of name.
2. W/N a petition for change of name is proper even if it merely confirms a legal right (i.e., the right to use the legitimate father's surname).

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that while the civil registry is an official record, entries therein are only *prima facie* evidence of the facts stated under Article 410 of the Civil Code [3]. Consequently, such entries may be corrected or cancelled by judicial order in proper cases pursuant to Article 412 of the Civil Code [3]. The trial court found credible evidence that the minor is the legitimate child of the petitioners, a factual finding binding on the Supreme Court [3].

2. **YES.** Citing *Asensi v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-18047), the Court held that there is no legal prohibition against such a petition [4]. Even if the petition is superfluous because it merely confirms a legal right (the child's right to his legitimate father's surname), it is not contrary to law, customs, or morals to grant it [4].

Petition granted. Decision affirmed [4].
