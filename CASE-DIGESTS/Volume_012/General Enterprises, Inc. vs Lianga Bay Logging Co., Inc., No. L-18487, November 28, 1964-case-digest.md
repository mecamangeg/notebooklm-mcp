I. CAPTION
GENERAL ENTERPRISES, INC. v. LIANGA BAY LOGGING COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-18487, November 28, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff General Enterprises and Defendant Lianga Bay Logging entered into an agreement where Defendant would supply logs for Plaintiff to sell. Defendant breached the contract by stopping the supply of logs. In a previous decision (August 31, 1964), the Supreme Court awarded Plaintiff P400,000.00 as *lucrum cessans* (lost profits) [1]. Defendant filed a Motion for Reconsideration and a Motion for New Trial, arguing that the award was unjustified because: (1) the obligation to supply was conditional; (2) commissions are earned only on actual sales, which did not occur; and (3) commissions paid to Plaintiff's sub-agent, Frinat International, should be deducted from the award [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N damages for *lucrum cessans* may include future transactions that were not accomplished due to the breach.
2. W/N commissions paid to a sub-agent should be deducted from the damages awarded.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that in cases of fraud or bad faith, "the obligor shall be responsible for all damages that may be reasonably attributed to the non-performance of the obligation" pursuant to Article 2201 of the New Civil Code [4, 5]. It is improper to base damages purely on past transactions and ignore those that could have been accomplished in the future had the Defendant not breached the contract [5, 6]. While commissions are technically earned on sales, the Plaintiff was prevented from concluding sales solely because the Defendant refused to supply the logs [7, 8].

2. **YES.** The Court held that the commission usually paid by the agent to its sub-agent must be deducted from the lost profits [9]. Evidence established that Plaintiff paid a 2% commission to its sub-agent, Frinat International, on previous sales (not 5% as claimed by Defendant) [10]. The Court recalculated the damages by taking the remaining obligation (34 million board feet) multiplied by Plaintiff's commission rate (P.0107456), totaling P365,350.40, and deducting the 2% sub-agent commission (P56,207.76) [11].

The Court **MODIFIED** the decision, awarding Plaintiff P309,142.64 as *lucrum cessans*, and **DENIED** the Motion for New Trial [12].
