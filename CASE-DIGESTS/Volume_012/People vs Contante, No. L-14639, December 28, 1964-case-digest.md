**I. CAPTION**
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JULIO CONTANTE**, G.R. No. L-14639, December 28, 1964, Per Curiam.

**II. FACTS**
On June 26, 1952, Anatolio Adayo was shot to death in his home in Tigaon, Camarines Sur. The investigation pointed to Julio Contante, an overseer for Tomas Garchitorena. The prosecution established that Garchitorena, who had an illicit affair with the victim's wife and pending criminal cases filed by the victim, hired Contante to kill Anatolio for P500.00.

Witnesses testified that Garchitorena provided Contante with a shotgun. Minutes after the shooting, the victim's brother, Marciano Adayo, saw Contante fleeing the scene carrying a shotgun. Contante was arrested and executed an extrajudicial confession detailing the crime and the location of the weapon. The shotgun was subsequently recovered in the area he indicated, and he voluntarily re-enacted the crime.

Contante's defense was alibi, claiming he was in another barrio (Maangas) during the incident, and he repudiated his confession alleging force and duress. The Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur convicted him of murder, qualified by treachery and aggravated by price and dwelling, sentencing him to death. Contante appealed, questioning the disregard of his alibi and the sufficiency of the circumstantial evidence.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the defense of alibi should prevail over the prosecution's evidence.
2. W/N the circumstantial evidence presented is sufficient to sustain a conviction for murder.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that alibi is the weakest of all defenses as it is the easiest to fabricate and concoct. It cannot be given credence unless convincingly demonstrated, especially when the prosecution evidence positively establishes the accused's presence at the scene [1]. The credibility of an alibi equates to the credibility of the witnesses establishing it, and the trial court's assessment of their credibility is generally accepted unless patently inconsistent with the evidence [2].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to convict beyond reasonable doubt. Under Rule 123, Sec. 98 of the Old Rules of Court (now Rule 133, Sec. 5), circumstantial evidence is sufficient if: (a) there is more than one circumstance; (b) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (c) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt [3].

Although witnesses regarding the specific motive recanted, the Court found an "unbroken chain" of facts pointing to Contante's guilt: (1) the victim was shot at home; (2) Contante was positively identified fleeing the scene with a shotgun minutes later; (3) he executed a voluntary extrajudicial confession; (4) the murder weapon was recovered in the specific location he indicated; and (5) he voluntarily re-enacted the crime [4-14]. These circumstances are consistent with the hypothesis of guilt and inconsistent with innocence [15].

**Decision modified.** The judgment is affirmed as to guilt, but the penalty is reduced to *reclusion perpetua* due to the lack of votes for the death penalty and the appellant's lack of education. Indemnity is increased to P6,000.00. The Court also urged the Department of Justice to prosecute the alleged mastermind, Tomas Garchitorena [16, 17].
