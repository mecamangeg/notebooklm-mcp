I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. EUTROPIO ROMAWAK, G.R. No. L-19644, October 31, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of September 1, 1958, Ariston Soriano and four companions were having supper in the house of Ponciano Lanza in Dulag, Leyte [1]. Soriano was seated with his back towards the closed door [1]. Suddenly, the accused Eutropio Romawak violently forced the door open and immediately stabbed Soriano in the back with a small bolo called a "pisao" [1]. Soriano jumped out of the window and eventually died from the wound [1]. Romawak also wounded two other occupants before leaving [1]. Romawak denied the killing, claiming he was merely passing by when attacked by one of the witnesses, whom he wounded in self-defense [2]. The Court of First Instance of Leyte convicted Romawak of Murder qualified by treachery, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* [3]. The accused appealed, questioning the credibility of witnesses and the finding of treachery [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt based on the credibility of the prosecution witnesses.
2. W/N the crime committed is Murder qualified by treachery.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the findings of the trial court, noting that conclusions on credibility and factual findings command great weight [4]. Four eyewitnesses positively identified Romawak and testified in a clear, convincing manner [5]. The Court rejected the defense of alibi, noting that Romawak had a clear motive as he was Soriano's rival suitor for the hand of the house owner's daughter [6].

2. **YES.** The killing was attended by treachery (*alevosia*). The attack was sudden and unexpected; Romawak forced the door open and immediately stabbed the victim, who was seated with his back to the door [1]. The position of the wound at the back and the suddenness of the assault ensured the victim had absolutely no chance to defend himself [7].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** in all respects [8].
