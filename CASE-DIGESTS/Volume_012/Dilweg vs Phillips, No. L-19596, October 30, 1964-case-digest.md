I. CAPTION
LAVERN R. DILWEG v. ROBERT O. PHILLIPS, INOCENTES DINEROS and ISAAC S. ECETA, G.R. No. L-19596, October 30, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On February 7, 1958, plaintiff Lavern R. Dilweg, a non-resident American citizen, filed a complaint for civil damages against defendants Robert O. Phillips and others for alleged libelous statements published in the Philippines [1]. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction over the person of the plaintiff because he was a non-resident alien who had never been in the Philippines [2], [3].

While the trial court initially denied the motion to dismiss, it later granted the defendants' motion for reconsideration during the trial on the merits [4]. On May 11, 1961, the trial court dismissed the complaint, ruling that for the court to validly try a personal action, it must acquire jurisdiction over the person of the plaintiff through residence or presence within the territorial jurisdiction [5]. Plaintiff appealed directly to the Supreme Court on a question of law [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a non-resident alien who is not within the Philippines can maintain a personal action for damages in Philippine courts.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that it is not indispensable for a foreigner to establish residence, nor is it necessary to be physically present in the country, to initiate or maintain a personal action against a resident for causes of action arising within the Philippines [6].

The Court emphasized that no general law restricts the right of non-resident aliens to sue in Philippine courts. Furthermore, the action was based on Article 33 of the Civil Code, which grants the "injured party" the right to bring a civil action for damages in cases of defamation. This provision makes no distinction as to whether the injured party is a citizen, resident, or alien [7]. The Court also noted that the existence of counterclaims against the non-resident plaintiff does not alter this right, as the Rules of Court provide remedies against non-resident parties [8].

The order appealed from was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [8].
