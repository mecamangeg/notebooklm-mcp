I. CAPTION
LAMBERTO YNOTORIO and SANTOS CATALAN v. CANUTA LIRA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16677, November 27, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On July 8, 1957, plaintiffs Lamberto Ynotorio and Santos Catalan filed an action against Canuta Lira and others for partition, recovery of ownership of 144 parcels of land, and damages [1]. Plaintiffs claimed inheritance rights from their deceased uncle, Felipe Ynotorio, alleging the properties were conjugal and fraudulently transferred by his widow, Canuta [2].

The defendants answered, asserting ownership via a will and subsequent donations, and interposed a counterclaim for P160,000.00 in damages, alleging that the plaintiffs' baseless suit caused them to incur attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and moral damages [3, 4]. During the pendency of the case, Canuta died, and a separate special proceeding for the settlement of the estate was instituted [5]. Consequently, plaintiffs moved to dismiss the civil case without prejudice [5]. Defendants opposed the dismissal, arguing their counterclaim could not remain pending for independent adjudication [5]. The trial court dismissed the case without prejudice, ruling the counterclaim could be the subject of a separate action or claim in the special proceedings [6]. Defendants appealed [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint over the objection of the defendants who set up a compulsory counterclaim.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the defendants' counterclaim—seeking damages for expenses and humiliation specifically caused by the institution of the plaintiffs' action—arises from or is necessarily connected with the plaintiffs' own action [7]. As such, it cannot remain pending for independent adjudication by the court [7].

Citing *Belleza v. Huntington*, *Froilan v. Pan Oriental Shipping Co.*, and *Domingo v. Santos*, the Court ruled that where a counterclaim arises from or is necessarily connected with the plaintiff's action and cannot be independently adjudicated, the lower court may not dismiss the case over the objection of the defendant [7].

The orders appealed from are **SET ASIDE**, and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [8].
