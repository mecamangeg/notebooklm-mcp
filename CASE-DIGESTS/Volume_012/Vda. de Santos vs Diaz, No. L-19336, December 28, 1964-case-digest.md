I. CAPTION
JOSEFA VDA. DE SANTOS, ET AL. v. ANDRES J. DIAZ, G.R. No. L-19336, December 28, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On March 6, 1928, Mamerto Santos filed an application for registration of several parcels of land in Las Piñas under Act No. 496. This was dismissed in 1929 due to his failure to amend a survey plan [1]. Years later, his heirs (petitioners) filed a second application for the same lands, which was dismissed in 1959 for "insufficiency of evidence" [1].

On August 4, 1960, petitioners filed the present application for registration [1]. Respondent Andres J. Diaz opposed the application regarding three lots, claiming fee simple ownership [2]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissed the application on the grounds of *res judicata* and estoppel, citing the previous dismissals [3]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the orders of dismissal in the two previous registration cases bar the present proceedings under the principle of *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the previous dismissals did not constitute *res judicata*.

Under Act No. 496, even as amended by Act No. 3621, a dismissal of a registration application does not necessarily bar a subsequent application unless there was a contentious issue essential to the application of *res judicata* [4]. In the previous cases, no opposition was filed; the first was dismissed for failure to submit a plan and the second for insufficiency of evidence [4]. Thus, there was no adjudication of conflicting interests or determination of ownership [4].

The Court distinguished this from proceedings under the Public Land Law or Cadastral Act, where a dismissal declares the land part of the public domain and binds the whole world [5]. Citing *Henson v. Director of Lands*, the Court reiterated that the purpose of the Land Registration Act is to encourage owners to register their titles; barring re-application when defects are cured or new evidence is found would impair the usefulness of the system [6, 7].

The order appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., and Zaldivar, JJ., concurred) [8].
