I. CAPTION
SALVADOR D. LACUNA v. BOARD OF LIQUIDATORS, PEDRO Q. MOLINA, as Commanding General of the Philippine Air Force, and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-18621, November 28, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Cirilo S. Damian was authorized by the Philippine Air Force (PAF) to repair its buildings, with payment agreed to be in surplus properties [1]. Damian assigned his rights to the balance of these properties to petitioner Salvador D. Lacuna, who notified the PAF of the assignment [2]. However, Damian subsequently wrote to the PAF revoking the deed of assignment, claiming Lacuna failed to comply with his obligations and that the deed lacked consideration [3]. Consequently, the PAF refused to honor the assignment. Lacuna filed a complaint for specific performance against the Board of Liquidators and the PAF Commanding General to compel recognition of the assignment [3, 4]. Lacuna did not implead Damian, the assignor [3]. Damian filed a motion to intervene in the trial court, but it was denied [4]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the assignor (Damian) is an indispensable party who should be allowed to intervene.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the assignor is an indispensable party. In an action for specific performance by an assignee against an obligor, where the obligor refuses performance due to an alleged revocation of the assignment by the assignor, the assignor must be included [5, 6]. The Court reasoned that failing to hear the assignor's side would constitute an injustice to him and prevent a fair and just review of the appeal [7]. Although Damian did not appeal the denial of his motion for intervention, the Court ruled he should be allowed to intervene in the interest of justice [7].

The records of the case were remanded to the trial court with instruction to allow the assignor’s intervention and thereafter to render judgment accordingly [8].
