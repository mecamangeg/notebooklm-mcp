I. CAPTION
ELIAS AGUSTIN v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and PANIQUI SUGAR MILLS, INC., G.R. No. L-19957, September 29, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Elias Agustin was employed as a Water Pump Tender by respondent Paniqui Sugar Mills, Inc. from 1920 until 1956 [1]. His duties involved pumping hot water into boilers, which exposed him to heat from furnaces and offensive bagasse dust [1]. In October 1956, X-ray findings showed he was suffering from minimal pulmonary tuberculosis, leading to his layoff [1]. He filed a claim for compensation, but the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) dismissed it [2]. The WCC ruled that Agustin failed to prove his illness was traceable to his employment, speculating that since the TB was found to be "minimal" after 23 years, it could not have originated from his work [3, 4]. The WCC also held that while the respondent company forfeited its right to controvert the claim by failing to file the required notice under Section 45 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, such forfeiture was waived because Agustin did not object to the appearance of the company's counsel [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claimant's illness is compensable under the statutory presumption of the Workmen’s Compensation Act.
2. W/N the claimant’s failure to object to the appearance of the employer's counsel constitutes a waiver of the employer’s forfeiture of the right to controvert the claim.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Section 43 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, there is a statutory presumption that a claim comes within the provisions of the Act in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary [6]. Once an illness is shown to have arisen in the course of employment, the laborer is relieved of the burden of proving causation, as the law presumes it arose *out* of the employment [4, 7]. The WCC's speculation that the disease was not work-related because it was only "minimal" after many years was insufficient to rebut this presumption [4]. The Court held that it is probable the working conditions reduced the laborer's resistance to the infection, and even if the conditions were only a contributory cause, the injury remains compensable [4, 7].

2. **NO.** The forfeiture of the employer's right to controvert a claim due to failure to file the notice required by Section 45 is a measure of public policy designed to compel observance of the Act [5, 8]. This sanction cannot be waived merely by the claimant's failure to object to the appearance of the employer's counsel [9]. The law prescribes that forfeiture can only be removed if the employer submits reasonable grounds for the failure to report to the Commissioner [8]. To rule otherwise would encourage employers to disregard the law and gamble on the laborer's ignorance [9].

The decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is **REVERSED** and **SET ASIDE**, and the case is **REMANDED** to the Commission for the computation of compensation due to the petitioner [10].
