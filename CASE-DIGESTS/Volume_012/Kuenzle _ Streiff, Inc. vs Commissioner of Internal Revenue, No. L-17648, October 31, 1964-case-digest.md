**I. CAPTION**
KUENZLE & STREIFF, INC. v. THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-17648, October 31, 1964, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Kuenzle & Streiff, Inc. maintains a branch office in Zamboanga. From January 1951 to September 1956, it received "agency fees" and "husbanding fees" totaling P110,452.05 [1, 2]. The "agency fees" were fixed monthly amounts received from various entities (e.g., Philippine Rubber Project Co., Basilan Lumber Co.) for services such as cashing checks, paying petty expenses, procuring supplies, and handling correspondence [2-5]. The "husbanding fees" were compensation from shipping companies for services including notifying port authorities of ship arrivals, provisioning vessels, contacting shippers, and assisting crew members [3, 6, 7].

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed the 6% commercial broker’s tax on these fees under Section 195 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) [8, 9]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) upheld the assessment [9]. Petitioner appealed, arguing it was not a broker but an employee or agent because it received fixed fees and performed acts the principals could have done themselves [10].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner is a commercial broker subject to the 6% commercial broker's tax on its agency and husbanding fees.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals [11]. Under Section 194(t) of the Tax Code, a "commercial broker" includes persons who, for compensation, negotiate freight or "other business for owners of vessels" or bring parties together [12, 13]. The essential feature of a broker is that he acts not for himself, but for a third person [14].

The Court ruled that the petitioner’s services—notifying authorities, provisioning ships, and handling payments—were all performed for its clients, not for itself [15]. The Court rejected the petitioner's claim that it was merely an employee or agent. An employee works exclusively for one firm and has no independent place of business, whereas a broker holds himself out generally for employment [16, 17]. Since the petitioner served multiple clients and maintained its own office, it lacked the "exclusiveness" required of an agency or employment relationship [16]. Furthermore, the fact that compensation was fixed does not negate broker status, as compensation includes fees for specific services [18]. The "husbanding services" clearly fall within the broad statutory clause "other business for owners of vessels" [13].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed [11].
