I. CAPTION
J.M. TUASON & CO., INC. v. ESPERANZA FERNANDEZ, G.R. No. L-19556, October 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On January 13, 1959, J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. filed a complaint against Esperanza Fernandez in the Court of First Instance of Rizal to recover possession of a parcel of land in Quezon City [1]. The sheriff served the summons on March 16, 1959, at a house on AIB Avenue, Quezon City, by leaving it with Jovita C. Arenas [2]. Arenas only delivered the summons to Fernandez on April 4, 1959 [2, 3]. On that same day, Fernandez filed a motion for extension of time to answer, and subsequently filed her Answer on April 8, 1959 [4].

However, on April 11, 1959, the trial court declared Fernandez in default for failure to answer within the reglementary period [4]. Fernandez moved to set aside the order of default, arguing that the service of summons was invalid. She established that while she owned the house on AIB Avenue where service was made, it was leased to Arenas, and Fernandez actually resided elsewhere (South 22 corner Cebu Avenue) [5]. The trial court denied her motion, ruling the service valid and that she had no meritorious defense [6]. Fernandez appealed [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the substituted service of summons served upon a lessee at a house owned by the defendant, but which is not her residence, is valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the service of summons was invalid. Under Section 8, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court, substituted service must be made by leaving copies of the summons "at the defendant’s dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein" [7].

In this case, the house where the sheriff served the summons was the residence of the lessee, Jovita Arenas, and not the dwelling house of Fernandez, who resided elsewhere [5]. Arenas was not authorized to receive pleadings on Fernandez's behalf [5]. Consequently, the service did not satisfy the requirements for valid substituted service [7]. The Court also noted that it was an abuse of discretion to deny the motion to set aside the default order, given that Fernandez had already filed her answer before the order was issued and possessed a meritorious defense as a purchaser for value [7, 8].

The order appealed from is set aside, and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [9].
