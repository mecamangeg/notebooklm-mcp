I. CAPTION
VICTORIAS-MANAPLA WORKERS ORGANIZATION - PAFLU v. THE HON. EMILIANO TABIGNE, Judge of the Court of Industrial Relations, VICTORIAS MILLING CO., INC., and VICMICO INDUSTRIAL WORKERS ASSOCIATION, G.R. No. L-19658, December 28, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
In CIR Case No. 22-MC-Iloilo, a certification election was conducted for the employees of Victorias Milling Co., Inc., in which petitioner VICMAWO intervened [1, 2]. After a run-off election on June 2, 1961, where the "no-union" option won against VICMAWO, the petitioner filed a protest alleging company interference [3]. On December 5, 1961, the original petitioners moved to withdraw their petition because no union obtained a majority and a new union, respondent VIWA, had applied for certification in a separate proceeding (Case No. 957-MC) [3]. On January 22, 1962, the CIR dismissed VICMAWO’s protest and granted the motion to withdraw, terminating Case No. 22-MC-Iloilo [3]. Subsequently, on January 26, 1962, respondent Judge Tabigne issued an order in Case No. 957-MC certifying VIWA as the sole bargaining representative [1]. VICMAWO filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the certification order was issued while Case No. 22-MC-Iloilo was still pending due to a motion for reconsideration [1, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR abused its discretion in certifying VIWA in Case No. 957-MC despite the alleged pendency of Case No. 22-MC-Iloilo.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the CIR did not abuse its discretion in issuing the certification order. The Court reasoned that the petitioner's argument overlooks the fact that prior to the issuance of the questioned order on January 26, 1962, the motion to withdraw the petition in Case No. 22-MC-Iloilo had already been granted on January 22, 1962 [4]. This earlier order effectively terminated the previous case and dismissed the protest regarding the run-off election [4]. While VICMAWO initially filed a motion for reconsideration, they subsequently withdrew it, confirming the termination of the proceedings [3, 4]. Consequently, there was no pending proceeding that would bar the certification of VIWA [4, 5].

Petition dismissed [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
