I. CAPTION
MANUEL L. PADILLA v. CALIXTO ZALDIVAR, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22789, October 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Pursuant to Republic Act No. 3848 (Rice Importation Law for 1964), the Rice and Corn Administration (RCA) conducted a public bidding for the importation of rice allocated to the private sector. Petitioner Manuel L. Padilla submitted a bid but failed to accompany it with the required "bidder's proposal bond" equivalent to 2% of the total C&F value of the bid [1, 2]. Instead, he submitted a commitment from an insurance company to issue a "performance bond" of 10% should the award be granted to him [3].

Due to the absence of the proposal bond, the Committee on Bids considered Padilla's bid defective and did not open his envelope [4]. The contracts were awarded to respondents Adelina Fores, Food Enrichment Enterprises, and HI Development Corporation [5]. Padilla’s appeals to the Committee, the Executive Secretary, and the President were denied [5]. He filed a petition for Mandamus and Prohibition with the Supreme Court, arguing that his offer of a performance bond demonstrated capability and that the RCA abused its discretion in disqualifying him [3, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the RCA gravely abused its discretion in disqualifying the petitioner for failing to submit a bidder’s proposal bond.
2. W/N a performance bond commitment can serve as a substitute for the required bidder’s proposal bond.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the bidder’s proposal bond is an indispensable requirement for the validation of a bid proposal in a government contract [6, 7]. The Invitation to Bid expressly provided that bids accompanied by insufficient proposal bonds would be disqualified; *a fortiori*, the total want of a bond is a ground for disqualification [8]. By submitting a bid, the petitioner impliedly bound himself to the terms of the bidding. While the RCA reserved the right to waive informalities, this is a discretionary power that cannot be controlled by Mandamus [9].

2. **NO.** A performance bond is distinct from a bidder’s proposal bond and cannot supply the lack of the latter [10, 11]. The purpose of the proposal bond is to insure the good faith of the bidder and bind them to enter into a contract should the proposal be accepted [3, 6]. In contrast, a performance bond is posted by the winning bidder to secure the faithful performance of the contract after it is awarded [3, 10]. Furthermore, the petitioner’s performance bond commitment was submitted late, days after the bidding [9]. Finally, the RCA is not unconditionally bound to allot the full importation quota to the private sector and may reject bids if the government can import on better terms [12, 13].

Petition is dismissed [14].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., and Barrera concurred in the result [14]. Justice Zaldivar took no part [14].
