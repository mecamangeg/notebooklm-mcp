I. CAPTION
GLICERIA C. LIWANAG, Special Administratrix of the Estate of Pio D. Liwanag v. HON. LUIS B. REYES, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila and ROTEGAAN FINANCING, INC., G.R. No. L-19159, September 29, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On July 14, 1960, Pio D. Liwanag executed a real estate mortgage in favor of respondent Rotegaan Financing, Inc. to secure a P180,000.00 loan. The contract stipulated that the debt be paid within one year and that, in case of judicial foreclosure, the mortgagor consented to the appointment of a receiver. Pio D. Liwanag died intestate before the one-year period expired [1].

Upon the mortgagor's failure to pay, Rotegaan Financing, Inc. filed a complaint for foreclosure against the Estate of Pio D. Liwanag and petitioner Gliceria Liwanag, as special administratrix [2]. Gliceria filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that she could not be sued as a special administratrix. She also opposed the prayer for receivership, contending the property was in *custodia legis* due to the pending administration proceedings [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila (Judge Reyes) issued the writ of receivership and deferred action on the motion to dismiss until after the trial [3]. Gliceria filed a petition for certiorari alleging abuse of discretion [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a special administratrix can be sued in a foreclosure action against the estate.
2. W/N the trial court's appointment of a receiver was proper despite the property being in *custodia legis*.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Rules of Court do not expressly prohibit making a special administratrix a defendant in a suit against the estate [5]. Under Section 7, Rule 86 of the Rules of Court, a secured creditor may foreclose on a mortgage by making the administrator a party-defendant [6]. The Supreme Court held that prohibiting such suits on technical grounds would prejudice creditors, as the statute of limitations would run against them while they waited for the appointment of a regular administrator, thereby defeating the purpose of the mortgage [5].

2. **YES.** The appointment was proper and did not constitute an abuse of discretion. The mortgage contract expressly provided that "in case of judicial foreclosure, the Mortgagor hereby consents to the appointment... of [a] receiver" [7]. This stipulation represented the will of the deceased and must be respected by the administratrix. The petitioner's argument regarding property in *custodia legis* is inapplicable because the action seeks to enforce a superior lien where receivership was agreed upon as a means of preserving the property [8].

The orders of the lower court are affirmed, and the petition is dismissed [9].
