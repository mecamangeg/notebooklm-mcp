I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JULIAN TIONGSON, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-9866-7, November 28, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
The appellants, soldiers Paulino Guieb, Wilson Alicante, Antonio Yacat, and Pablo Antonio, were assigned to guard the residence of Atty. Marcelino Sayo in Quezon City due to threats from the relatives of the Lopez brothers. On the evening of June 26, 1952, victims Rizalino Lopez and Mariano Lopez, Jr., along with two others, were in the vicinity of the house. Julian Tiongson, a civilian guard, stopped them at gunpoint and herded them to the middle of the street. Tiongson called out to the soldiers, and shortly after, a volley of shots was fired, killing Rizalino and Mariano, Jr. [1-4].

Ballistics tests revealed that the bullets and shells recovered from the scene and the victims' bodies matched the firearms of Tiongson, a man named "German," and appellants Guieb and Alicante. However, no bullets or shells matched the firearms of appellants Yacat (a BAR) and Antonio (a Garand rifle), which were surrendered with full or nearly full ammunition clips [5-7]. The trial court convicted all four appellants of murder qualified by treachery and abuse of superior strength, aggravated by band [8]. Tiongson withdrew his appeal, leaving the four soldiers as appellants [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N appellants Yacat and Antonio are criminally liable for the murders despite negative ballistics findings.
2. W/N conspiracy existed between appellants Guieb and Alicante and the other accused.
3. W/N the killing was qualified by treachery.
4. W/N the crime was aggravated by band.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The physical evidence contradicts the prosecution witnesses' testimony that all soldiers fired. The ballistics report confirmed that no shots were fired from Yacat’s and Antonio’s guns, and their magazines were found containing live ammunition [6, 7]. Physical evidence of this nature casts serious doubt on the testimonial evidence, especially given the confusion of the event. Furthermore, credible testimony placed them at the back of the house guarding the rear premises during the shooting [9, 10]. They are acquitted based on reasonable doubt [11, 12].

2. **YES.** While their presence at the scene was initially for a lawful duty, the shooting was preceded by circumstances showing a common accord. When Tiongson shouted a code word, Guieb and Alicante emerged and deployed; when Tiongson fired, they immediately followed suit with a volley of bullets [13]. Conspiracy arises the very instant plotters agree, expressly or impliedly, to commit the felony and decide to pursue it, and may be inferred from the accused's acts pointing to a joint purpose and design [13-15].

3. **YES.** The attack was sudden and perpetrated to insure execution without risk to the attackers. The victims were unarmed, standing in the middle of the street in plain view, and had their hands raised in surrender when shot [16, 17]. The circumstance of abuse of superior strength is absorbed in treachery [17].

4. **YES.** The crime was committed by more than three armed malefactors acting together (Tiongson, "German," Guieb, and Alicante) [18].

The judgment is **REVERSED** as to Antonio Yacat and Pablo Antonio, who are **ACQUITTED**. The judgment is **AFFIRMED** as to Paulino Guieb and Wilson Alicante, sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua* (due to the offsetting aggravating circumstance of band and mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender) and holding them solidarily liable for indemnity [12, 19].
