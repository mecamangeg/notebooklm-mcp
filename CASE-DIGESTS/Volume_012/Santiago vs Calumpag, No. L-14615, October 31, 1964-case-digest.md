I. CAPTION
MANUEL SANTIAGO v. RAFAEL CALUMPAG and RITA ESTOR, G.R. No. L-14615, October 31, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Manuel Santiago possessed a parcel of land in Villahermosa, Pilar, Cebu, by virtue of a mortgage executed by the real owners, Bonifacia Maratas and Esteban Moste. The mortgage agreement allowed Santiago to administer the land and enjoy its produce. On December 10, 1956, Santiago allowed respondents Rafael Calumpag and Rita Estor to cultivate the land as tenants for as long as the mortgage existed [1].

In September 1957, the owners redeemed the mortgage. During the harvest that month, Santiago informed the respondents of the redemption and told them to leave the land as his tenure had expired. Subsequently, the real owners placed a new tenant on the land [1-3].

Respondents filed a complaint for damages for illegal ejectment against Santiago in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). The CAR ruled in favor of the respondents, declaring the agreement limiting tenancy to the mortgage duration void and ordering Santiago to pay P78.00 in damages and P150.00 in attorney's fees [4]. Santiago petitioned for review, arguing his juridical tie with the tenants ended upon the mortgage redemption [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is liable for damages for illegal ejectment for telling the tenants to leave upon the termination of his right to possess the land.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the lower court's decision and absolved the petitioner.

The Court held that the act of a landholder in telling a tenant to leave because the agreed term has expired does not constitute a wrong, provided no force or threat is used [3, 6]. There was no finding that the tenants were forcibly turned out; Santiago merely informed them that his right to lease the land had expired [3].

While Section 9 of Republic Act No. 1199 provides that the sale or alienation of the land does not extinguish the tenancy relationship and that the transferee shall assume the rights and obligations of the former landholder, this right to security of tenure must be enforced against the transferee (the owners) [3, 7]. However, the real owners (the Moste spouses) were not made parties to the case. Since Santiago’s right to possess the land ceased upon the redemption of the mortgage, and the placement of the new tenant was the act of the owners, Santiago cannot be held liable for damages [3].

**Disposition:** The judgment on appeal is set aside and Manuel Santiago is absolved from the complaint.
