I. CAPTION
JUAN SORIANO v. HON. PERFECTO R. PALACIO and ENGRACIA MEDENILLA, G.R. No. L-17469, November 28, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Juan Soriano was the defendant in Civil Case No. 4534 before the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur [1]. After a judgment was rendered, Soriano filed a motion for reconsideration on March 14, 1960, claiming the court never acquired jurisdiction over him because the summons was defectively served upon a neighbor, Rufina Soriano, who failed to deliver it to him [2]. The lower court denied this motion on March 19, 1960 [3]. Soriano’s counsel received the notice of denial on March 25, 1960 but failed to perfect an appeal within the 30-day period [4]. Instead, Soriano filed a second motion on June 30, 1960, reiterating his previous arguments, which was also denied [3, 5]. Soriano then filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court acquired jurisdiction over the petitioner despite the alleged defective service of summons.
2. W/N the petitioner is bound by the lower court's denial of his motion.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Even assuming *arguendo* that the lower court originally failed to acquire jurisdiction due to the defective service of summons, the petitioner submitted to the court's jurisdiction when he filed his first motion for reconsideration on March 14, 1960 [4]. The filing of the motion cured the alleged defect in jurisdiction.

2. **YES.** The denial of the first motion for reconsideration became binding on the petitioner because he failed to perfect an appeal within 30 days of receiving the notice of denial on March 25, 1960 [4]. The order became final on April 25, 1960, and the second motion filed on June 30, 1960 was too late to affect the already final and executory order [5].

The petition for certiorari is **DENIED** and the preliminary injunction is **DISSOLVED** [5].
