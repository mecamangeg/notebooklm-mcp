I. CAPTION
RAMON A. GONZALES v. THE PROVINCIAL AUDITOR OF ILOILO, G.R. No. L-20568, December 28, 1964, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ramon A. Gonzales, while serving as a Municipal Councilor of Lambunao, Iloilo, was appointed as "Assistant on Complaints and Investigation" in the Office of the Governor effective July 1, 1961 [1]. Respondent Provincial Auditor refused to pass in audit petitioner's salary vouchers, arguing that the appointment violated Section 2175 of the Revised Administrative Code regarding double holding of office [2]. Petitioner appealed to the Auditor General, who upheld the Respondent's refusal on November 26, 1961 [3].

Instead of appealing the Auditor General's decision to the President of the Philippines, petitioner filed a petition for mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo [4]. Respondent sought dismissal on the ground that petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies [5]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the proper remedy was an appeal to the President or the Supreme Court under Commonwealth Act No. 327 [6-8]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for mandamus should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Under Article XI, Section 3 of the Constitution and Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 327, decisions of the Auditor General are appealable to the President of the Philippines when the aggrieved party is a government official or employee [9-11].

The Court explained that the Auditor General exercises quasi-judicial power and discretion when passing on salary vouchers [11]. Since the petitioner was a person in the government service claiming salary, his recourse was to appeal the Auditor General's adverse decision to the President, who is empowered by law to grant relief [11]. The Court applied the principle that no recourse to courts can be had until all administrative remedies have been exhausted, and special civil actions against administrative officers should not be entertained if superior administrative officers can grant relief [12].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed [13].
