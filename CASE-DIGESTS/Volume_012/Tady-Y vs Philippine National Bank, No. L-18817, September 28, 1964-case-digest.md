I. CAPTION
ANTONIO G. TADY-Y v. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK and PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, G.R. No. L-18817, September 28, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On February 2, 1951, Segundo Swansing, acting for himself and others, obtained an agricultural loan of P840.00 from respondent Philippine National Bank (PNB) secured by a registered mortgage on Lot No. 1257 [1]. The mortgage deed contained a provision securing the P840.00 "as well as those that the Mortgagee may extend to the Mortgagor... or any other obligation... as appears in the accounts, books and Records of the Mortgagee" [2, 3].

On April 30, 1955, the mortgagors constituted a second mortgage on the same lot in favor of Marcelo G. Aguirre, who later assigned his rights to petitioner Antonio G. Tady-Y [1, 4]. Following the mortgagors' default, PNB extrajudicially foreclosed the property and purchased it at public auction on January 31, 1958, for P5,093.45 [4].

Petitioner filed a complaint for mandamus, arguing that PNB was only entitled to the registered credit of P840.00 plus interest (totaling P1,759.60) and demanded the delivery of the alleged surplus from the auction proceeds to satisfy his second mortgage [5]. PNB refused, countering that the mortgage secured subsequent obligations (sugar and palay crop loans) totaling P9,579.08, leaving no surplus [3]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the first mortgage validly secured future loans not explicitly annotated on the certificate of title, thereby precluding the existence of a surplus for the second mortgagee.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The provision in the mortgage deed including future amounts as part of the obligation is valid and not improper [8]. Citing *Lim Julian v. Lutero* (49 Phil. 703), the Court held that the amounts named as consideration in a contract of mortgage do not limit the amount for which the mortgage may stand as security, if from the "four corners of the instrument" the intent to secure future and other indebtedness can be gathered [8].

The annotation on the certificate of title, which stated that the mortgage secured the payment of P840.00 plus "other obligations arising thereunder," was sufficient notice to charge a junior encumbrancer with the duty to examine the provisions of the mortgage deed and the books of the PNB regarding the debtors' credit standing [9, 10]. Since PNB's total claim exceeded the foreclosure proceeds, there was no surplus to which the petitioner was entitled [11].

**Decision affirmed.**
