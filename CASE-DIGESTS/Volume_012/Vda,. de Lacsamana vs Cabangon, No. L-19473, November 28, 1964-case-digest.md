I. CAPTION
REMEDIOS L. VDA. DE LACSAMANA v. HON. DOMINGO M. CABANGON, Court of Agrarian Relations, Third Regional District, and RUPERTO ARELLANO, G.R. No. L-19473, November 28, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner landowner Remedios L. Vda. de Lacsamana sought review of a decision by the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). The CAR directed her to reinstate respondent tenant Ruperto Arellano to the landholding and pay him the share of produce he failed to receive due to alleged illegal ejectment. Lacsamana argued the CAR erred in finding the ejectment illegal, contending that the conversion of the crop from palay to sugar cane was justified. She further claimed the tenant objected to the conversion and refused her offer of another land to work on. She maintained that her actions were an exercise of managerial rights under Section 25 of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended by Republic Act No. 2263, rather than an illegal ejectment.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to resolve the issues raised in the petition which involve the review of factual findings.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court found that the errors assigned by the petitioner—specifically regarding the justification of crop conversion and the award of damages despite the tenant's refusal of other land—would necessitate a review of the evidence presented during the trial and a re-evaluation of the factual findings of the lower court. The Court ruled that such matters properly fall within the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, citing Section 156 of Republic Act No. 3844 and the Supreme Court Minute Resolution of September 26, 1963 [1].

Case remanded to the Court of Appeals for proper proceedings.
