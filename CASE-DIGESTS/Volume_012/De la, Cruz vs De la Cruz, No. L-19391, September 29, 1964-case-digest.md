I. CAPTION
**CECILIO DE LA CRUZ and EUSTAQUIA DEVIS DE LA CRUZ v. MANUEL JESUS DE LA CRUZ**, G.R. No. L-19391, September 29, 1964

II. FACTS
Petitioners Cecilio and Eustaquia De la Cruz filed a petition for the revocation of the adoption of the respondent, Manuel Jesus De la Cruz, in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, where the petitioners currently reside [1]. The original decree of adoption had been granted by the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur (Case No. 1041) [2].

The trial court dismissed the petition, ruling that the proceedings should have been filed in Ilocos Sur where the adoption expediente was presumably still open [2]. The lower court implied that hearing the case would constitute interference with a court of coordinate jurisdiction [2]. Petitioners appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the venue for a petition to revoke an adoption is the place of residence of the petitioner, rather than the court that granted the original adoption decree.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the venue was properly laid in Pangasinan [3].

The Court explained that proceedings for adoption and revocation of adoption are separate and distinct from each other [4], [5]. Once a court grants an adoption and the decree becomes final, that proceeding is terminated and closed [4], [1]. A subsequent petition for revocation is not a continuation of the adoption proceeding but is an entirely new action dependent on facts that have happened since the decree [4], [1].

Since Rule 100 of the Rules of Court (on rescission and revocation of adoption) is silent regarding venue, the Court applied Rule 99 (on adoption) in a suppletory character [2], [1]. Under Rule 99, the proper venue is the place of residence of the petitioner [4], [1]. Since the petitioners reside in Pangasinan, the court there has jurisdiction [1].

Furthermore, the doctrine prohibiting interference with judgments of a court of coordinate jurisdiction does not apply [6], [7]. The petitioners did not question the validity of the original Ilocos Sur decree nor seek to enjoin it, but sought its revocation based on supervening circumstances that rendered the adoptive relationship unjustified [7], [8].

The order of dismissal was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** for further proceedings [3].
