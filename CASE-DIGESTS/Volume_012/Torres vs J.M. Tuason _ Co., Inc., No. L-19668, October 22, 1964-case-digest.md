I. CAPTION
DOMINGA TORRES v. J.M. TUASON & CO., INC. and EUSTAQUIO ALQUIROS, G.R. No. L-19668, October 22, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Dominga Torres alleged that she purchased a 690-square-meter parcel of land in Quezon City from defendant Eustaquio Alquiros, a successor-in-interest of the Deudors [1]. Following a compromise agreement in a separate civil case between the Deudors and J.M. Tuason & Co., Torres demanded that J.M. Tuason & Co. execute a new contract of sale in her favor for the lot she occupied, pursuant to the terms of said compromise [1, 2].

When the company failed to comply, Torres filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Manila specifically praying for the company to execute a final deed of sale and cause the issuance of a Transfer Certificate of Title in her name [3]. J.M. Tuason & Co. moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of improper venue. The trial court dismissed the case, ruling that the action concerned title to real property situated in Quezon City and should have been filed there [4]. Torres appealed, arguing that her action was one for specific performance and was therefore personal and transitory in nature [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an action to compel the execution of a deed of sale and issuance of title for real property is a real action that must be filed where the property is situated.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal [5].

Although the complaint was entitled one for specific performance, the fact that Torres asked for the issuance of a deed of sale and a transfer certificate of title for land in Quezon City demonstrated that the primary objective was to recover the parcel of land itself [6]. To execute the requested conveyance, the court would first need to make a finding that the plaintiff is the owner of the land, which ultimately resolves into an issue of ownership [6, 7].

Therefore, the suit affects title to or recovery of possession of real property. Pursuant to Section 3, Rule 5 of the Rules of Court, such actions must be commenced and tried in the province where the property or any part thereof lies [6]. Since the property was in Quezon City, the venue was improperly laid in Manila.

The order of the lower court dismissing the complaint is AFFIRMED [5].
