I. CAPTION
MUNICIPALITY OF LA CARLOTA v. NATIONAL WATERWORKS and SEWERAGE AUTHORITY (NAWASA), G.R. No. L-20232, September 30, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
The National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) took control of the waterworks system of the Municipality of La Carlota pursuant to Republic Act No. 1383. The Municipality filed an action to recover the system. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of the Municipality, ordering NAWASA to return the dominion, possession, supervision, administration, and control of the water system and to render an accounting of collections. NAWASA appealed, conceding that the transfer of ownership was unconstitutional for lack of just compensation (citing *City of Baguio v. NAWASA* and *City of Cebu v. NAWASA*). However, NAWASA argued that under Section 1 of R.A. 1383, it was still authorized to exercise "jurisdiction, supervision and control" over the system even if ownership remained with the Municipality [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N NAWASA may validly exercise jurisdiction, supervision, and control over the municipal waterworks system without paying just compensation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that vesting jurisdiction, supervision, and control in NAWASA would destroy the integrity of the Municipality's right of dominion. Ownership is nothing without the inherent rights of possession, control, and enjoyment [5, 6]. Where an owner is deprived of the ordinary and beneficial use of their property or its value by its diversion to public use, there is a "taking" within the constitutional sense [6, 7]. Granting NAWASA's prayer would amount to an assumption of ownership rather than mere administration. Consequently, the judgment of the lower court is affirmed [6, 8].
