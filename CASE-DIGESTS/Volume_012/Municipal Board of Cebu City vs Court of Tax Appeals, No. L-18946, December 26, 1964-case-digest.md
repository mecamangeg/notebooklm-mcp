I. CAPTION
MUNICIPAL BOARD, in representation of the City of Cebu v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS, BOARD OF ASSESSMENT APPEALS, Cebu City and AGUSTIN JEREZA, for and in behalf of the University of Southern Philippines Foundation, G.R. No. L-18946, December 26, 1964, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Agustin Jereza, representing the University of Southern Philippines Foundation, claimed tax exemptions for certain lots in Cebu City. The City Board of Assessment Appeals (BAA) rendered a decision exempting said lots from real property tax. The Municipal Board, representing the City of Cebu, appealed this decision to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). The CTA dismissed the appeal, reasoning that the BAA is merely an instrumentality of the City, and that the City is a governmental agency not included among those who may appeal under Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125. The Municipal Board filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City of Cebu can appeal a decision of the Board of Assessment Appeals to the Court of Tax Appeals.
2. W/N the Municipal Board has the personality to represent the City of Cebu in said appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The City of Cebu constitutes a political body corporate endowed with the power to sue and be sued and is authorized to levy real estate taxes for its support [1]. Under Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125, any "person, association or corporation adversely affected" by a decision of a Board of Assessment Appeals may appeal to the CTA [2]. The Court held that no entity is more adversely affected by the tax exemption than the City itself, as it stands to lose yearly income equivalent to the realty tax [3]. Citing *City of Manila v. Board of Assessment Appeals*, the Court affirmed that a city is a corporation adversely affected by such decisions and may validly appeal [3].

2. **YES.** Section 58 of the City Charter (Commonwealth Act No. 58) expressly vests the Municipal Board with the authority to appeal decisions of the City Assessor to the Board of Assessment Appeals. This statutory provision indicates the legislative intent to lodge in the Municipal Board the right to represent the City in appeals from adverse decisions of the Board of Assessment Appeals [4].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.
