I. CAPTION
**ONG BON KOK alias UY SAE TIN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-19583, September 30, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ong Bon Kok, a teacher and dried fish wholesaler, filed a petition for naturalization, which the Court of First Instance of Negros Oriental granted [1-3]. The Solicitor General appealed the decision on three grounds: (1) petitioner's moral character was not good because he allegedly under-declared his income by deducting personal sustenance from his gross income; (2) his character witnesses were not credible; and (3) he illegally used the alias "Uy Sae Tin" [2, 4]. regarding the income issue, petitioner testified that he withdrew funds for his family's sustenance from his gross income, which the government interpreted as a violation of the National Internal Revenue Code for deducting personal expenses before reporting gross income [4, 5]. regarding the alias, records showed he was referred to as "Uy Sae Tin" in Bureau of Private Education records and "Ong Bon Kok alias Uy Sae Tin" in his petition and civil documents [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner failed to establish good moral character due to the alleged income tax misdeclaration.
2. W/N the character witnesses presented were credible and competent.
3. W/N the petitioner committed the illegal use of an alias.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Solicitor General's conclusion was erroneous. The petitioner merely testified that he withdrew amounts for sustenance *from* the gross income, not that the amount declared in his tax return (P9,391.30) already excluded the cost of sustenance [7]. There was no admission of deducting personal expenses for tax purposes [7].

2. **YES.** The Court found the witnesses credible. They were Ramon Ponce de Leon (petitioner's family physician and a Rotary Governor) and Orlando Consing (local Chief of Police and petitioner's neighbor) [3, 7]. Both were lawyers who had close contact with the petitioner and declared he possessed the requisite qualifications. Furthermore, the petitioner was well-known in the community as a teacher and merchant [3].

3. **NO.** The petitioner was originally known as "Uy Sae Tin," which explains the name in school records. He was later known as "Ong Bon Kok" [8]. The indication of the alias in the petition, marriage contract, and other documents did not constitute illegal use; it merely indicated he is the same person formerly known by the other name [8]. The inclusion of the alias in the naturalization petition is actually required by law [9]. There was no evidence he used the alias in his business or social activities illegally [9].

**Decision affirmed.** [9]
