I. CAPTION
ADOLFO B. BENAVIDES v. EDUARDO ALABASTRO, G.R. No. L-19762, December 23, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On August 26, 1955, the Municipal Court of Manila ordered Eduardo Alabastro to pay Ajax International Corporation the sum of P274.85 plus interest and fees [1]. In 1961, Ajax assigned its rights to the judgment to Adolfo B. Benavides, who subsequently demanded payment [2]. When Alabastro failed to pay, Benavides filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Manila [2]. Alabastro filed an answer specifically denying the allegations for lack of knowledge and raising the affirmative defense that the claim was extinguished and not validly revived [3, 4]. Benavides moved for judgment on the pleadings, which the trial court granted, ordering Alabastro to pay [3]. Alabastro appealed to the Supreme Court, contending the lower court erred in deciding the case without the presentation of evidence [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in rendering judgment on the pleadings.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that it is error to render judgment on the pleadings when the defendant's answer tenders an issue [5]. Relying on *Fabella v. Provincial Sheriff of Rizal*, the Court explained that judgment on the pleadings is only proper if the answer fails to tender an issue or admits all material allegations of the complaint [5]. In this case, Alabastro's answer not only denied material allegations but also set up special and affirmative defenses, the nature of which requires the presentation of evidence to be resolved [5].

The decision is **REVERSED** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [6].
