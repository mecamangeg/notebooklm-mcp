I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DOMINADOR SEGARINO Y BORGA, GREGORIO DE GUZMAN y GABRIEL, and LIBERTY INSURANCE CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-20138, November 27, 1964, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On August 2, 1961, the trial for theft against accused Gregorio de Guzman was called in the Court of First Instance of Manila. The accused failed to appear. A family member moved for postponement alleging the accused was sick, but the attached medical certificate was not under oath [1]. The trial court declared the motion a "sham," ordered the arrest of the accused, and confiscated the P2,000.00 bail bond posted by Liberty Insurance Corporation [1].

Liberty Insurance received the confiscation order on August 9, 1961. On September 6, 1961, it requested an extension of the 30-day period to produce the accused, claiming he was in custody pending a certificate of confinement [2]. The court denied this on September 12 for lack of proof and ordered execution against the bond [3]. Liberty subsequently surrendered the accused and moved to lift the confiscation, arguing that it had notified the accused of the trial and that his non-appearance was due to swollen ears and a change of address [4]. The lower court denied the motion, ruling that mere notification was insufficient and the explanation for the non-appearance was unsatisfactory given the unverified medical certificate and the accused's absence from his residence when sought by police [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the liability of the bondsman should be reduced despite the tardy surrender of the accused and the unsatisfactory explanation for his non-appearance.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court modified the order to reduce the forfeiture to one-half of the amount of the bond.

The Supreme Court affirmed that the bondsman failed to justify total exoneration. Under the Rules, a bondsman must produce the body of the accused within the required period and explain the non-appearance satisfactorily [7]. The Court held that simply notifying the accused of the trial does not satisfy the undertaking. Citing *People v. Uy Tuising*, the Court emphasized that a surety's authority "is no more nor less than the Government’s authority to hold the said accused under preventive imprisonment," and thus it must produce the accused bodily in court [7]. Furthermore, the explanation regarding the accused's sickness was correctly rejected by the lower court as the medical certificate was unverified [6].

However, the Court ruled that the liability should be mitigated. Citing *People v. Puyal*, the Court noted that partial remission may be granted when the surety presents the accused, even if tardily [8]. Following the precedent in *People v. Reyes*, where the accused's non-appearance was not satisfactorily explained but the accused was eventually produced, the Court determined it just to reduce the liability to one-half [8, 9].

The order appealed from is modified, reducing the appellant’s liability under the bond to one-half of its amount [9].
