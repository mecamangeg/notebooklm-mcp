I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF PETITION TO BE ADMITTED AS CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, FELIX A. QUA alias QUA HOCK DU v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19834, October 27, 1964, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Felix A. Qua, a citizen of Nationalist China, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Albay on April 5, 1961. In his petition, he stated that his permanent residence was Legaspi City but failed to mention any other residence. However, during trial, he testified that after graduating high school in 1957, he resided in Manila at 1771 A. Mabini Street, Malate to pursue his college studies, returning to Legaspi only during vacations. Furthermore, the petition failed to allege that he believed in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution. During his testimony, he merely stated that he *knew* these principles and named some of them. The trial court granted the petition. The Republic appealed, contending the petition was fatally defective.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to state the applicant's temporary actual residence in Manila in the petition is a fatal defect.
2. W/N the failure to explicitly allege and prove belief in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution is fatal.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law (Com. Act No. 473) requires the petition to set forth the applicant’s "present and former places of residence." This requirement encompasses actual, physical residence, not merely legal residence or domicile. The purpose is to provide the public and investigating agencies the opportunity to gather information and express objections, which are likely to come from people in the petitioner's actual physical surroundings. The omission of the Manila address deprived the government of this opportunity and cannot be cured by evidence presented during the trial (*Lo v. Republic*).

2. **YES.** The failure to allege in the petition that the applicant believes in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution is fatal. Moreover, the petitioner only testified that he *knew* the principles. Evidence of knowledge is not evidence of belief. Courts must not admit a petitioner to Filipino citizenship in the absence of an allegation and competent proof that he believes in the principles of the Constitution (*Ching v. Republic*).

The judgment appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DENIED**.
