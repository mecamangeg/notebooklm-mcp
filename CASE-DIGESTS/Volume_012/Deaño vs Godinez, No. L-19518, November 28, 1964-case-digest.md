I. CAPTION
TRINIDAD A. DEAÑO, ET AL. v. DIOGENES GODINEZ, G.R. No. L-19518, November 28, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Trinidad A. Deaño, a school dentist, filed a complaint for damages against defendant Diogenes Godinez, a district supervisor [1]. On March 20, 1956, Godinez wrote a letter to his immediate superior, the Division Superintendent of Schools, explaining an alleged confusion in the district's dental-medical reports [2, 3]. In the letter, Godinez accused Deaño of deliberate misinformation, twisting facts, and requiring teachers to sign blank forms for contributions [3]. He further described her as a "carping critic" and "fault finder" who "did more harm than good" [3, 4]. Deaño claimed these statements were derogatory and caused her mental anguish [5]. Godinez moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing the letter was a privileged communication [2]. The Court of First Instance of Lanao del Norte upheld the motion and dismissed the complaint [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defamatory letter sent by the defendant to his superior is a privileged communication.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the letter is a privileged communication under Article 354 of the Revised Penal Code [6, 7]. The communication was sent by the defendant to his immediate superior in the performance of a legal duty and in the exercise of an official function, specifically as an explanation regarding the dental-medical drive [8].

Although the Court noted that the defendant employed language that was "somewhat harsh and uncalled for," such statements are excusable in the interest of public policy [8]. The doctrine of privileged communication rests on the necessity of subjecting the conduct of persons charged with wrongdoing to investigation without the fear of punishment for defamation [9]. Being a privileged communication, it is presumed to have been sent without malice, and the plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was actuated by malicious motives [10].

The Order of the lower court is AFFIRMED [11].
