I. CAPTION
TALISAY-SILAY MILLING CO., INC. v. VICENTE G. BUNUAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16933, December 29, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
For the 1956-1957 crop year, petitioner Talisay-Silay Milling Co., Inc. reported to respondent Sugar Quota Administrator Vicente Bunuan that planters in its district failed to fill their allotments for "A" (export) and "B" (domestic) sugar. However, there was a surplus of "C" (reserve) sugar available [1]. Acting on this report, Bunuan issued a letter on October 14, 1957, reallocating the unfilled quotas to holders of "C" sugar pursuant to the Sugar Limitation Law [2, 3]. While the reallocation for "A" sugar was implemented, respondent Secretary of Commerce and Industry disapproved the conversion of "C" sugar to "B" sugar, invoking Sugar Order No. 5 which required his prior approval for such conversions [4, 5]. Consequently, the Administrator instructed the Permit Agent not to sign the warehouse receipts [4].

Petitioner filed a petition for mandamus to compel respondents to implement the reallocation. Respondents argued that the refusal was justified to prevent glutting the domestic market and that petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies [6, 7]. The Court of First Instance of Manila granted the writ [8, 9]. Respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the reallocation of unfilled sugar allotments is mandatory upon the Sugar Quota Administrator and the Secretary of Commerce.
2. W/N the petition is barred by failure to exhaust administrative remedies for not appealing to the President.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that under Section 8-A of the Sugar Limitation Law (Act No. 4166, as amended by R.A. No. 1072), if an allotment holder cannot fill their quota, the unfilled amount "shall be reallocated" by the Administration [10]. This provision is mandatory and serves the statutory objective of ensuring the total quota for the year is actually produced and utilized [3, 11]. The system of reallocation is a means to fill the fixed quota, and respondents have no authority to defeat this by refusing to act [3]. Sugar Order No. 5 cannot be used to frustrate the purpose of the Act [12]. Furthermore, the proper remedy for a potential market glut is to adjust the quota for the *succeeding* year, not to refuse to fill the unfilled allotments of the *current* year [13].

2. **NO.** The rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies does not require an appeal to the President in this case because no statute provides for such an appeal from the Secretary of Commerce and Industry regarding sugar quota reallocations [7]. An appeal based solely on the President's general supervisory authority is not considered an "adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law" that would bar the special civil action of mandamus [7].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [14].
