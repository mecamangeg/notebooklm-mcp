I. CAPTION
DIONISIO A. SARANDI v. CORAZON ESPINO, THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF NUEVA VIZCAYA, et al., G.R. No. L-20822, December 23, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Dionisio Sarandi, the re-elected Municipal Mayor of Maddela, Nueva Vizcaya, was suspended from office on July 6, 1962, by Provincial Governor Jose Espino based on an administrative complaint for oppression and misconduct [1]. The suspension order was served on July 9, 1962, and the Provincial Board set the hearing for July 26, 1962. Petitioner requested a postponement to engage counsel, which was granted [2]. On September 14, 1962, Petitioner moved to set the case for hearing, but the Board failed to act due to a depletion in its membership [3, 4].

On September 27, 1962, Petitioner attempted to reassume office, arguing his preventive suspension had exceeded the legal limit, but the Provincial Auditor refused to authorize his salary [2]. Petitioner filed this action for reinstatement. Pending the case, he was notified on March 4, 1963, of a hearing scheduled for March 11 in Bayombong [5]. Due to the distance and lack of communication facilities in Maddela, he could not contact his counsel in Manila. He appeared at the hearing to request a postponement, which was denied. The Board, consisting only of the Acting Governor (Corazon Espino) and the Provincial Treasurer, proceeded with the investigation and rendered a decision suspending him until the end of his term [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner was entitled to automatic reinstatement after the lapse of the 30-day preventive suspension period.
2. W/N the administrative hearing and decision rendered by the Provincial Board were valid despite the lack of quorum.
3. W/N the denial of the motion for postponement constituted a denial of due process.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that under Section 2189 of the Revised Administrative Code, the preventive suspension of a municipal officer shall not exceed 30 days. Excluding the delay caused by Petitioner's request for postponement (from July 26 to September 14), the 30-day period expired on September 27, 1962 [6]. The depletion of the Provincial Board's membership does not excuse the failure to hear the case or suspend the operation of the law requiring reinstatement after the statutory period [4].

2. **NO.** The hearing and decision were declared null and void for lack of authority. The Board consisted of only two members: Acting Governor Espino and the Provincial Treasurer. Section 5 of Republic Act No. 2264 expressly requires the presence of three members to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by the Provincial Board [4].

3. **YES.** The denial of the motion for postponement deprived the Petitioner of his day in court. The Petitioner was notified only a few days before the hearing while in a remote municipality with no means to communicate with his counsel in Manila. To reach the hearing venue, he had to travel over 100 kilometers by boat and bus. Under these circumstances, denying the postponement amounted to a denial of due process [7, 8].

The petition is **GRANTED**. Petitioner is entitled to recover salaries and emoluments from September 28, 1962, until the expiration of his term.
