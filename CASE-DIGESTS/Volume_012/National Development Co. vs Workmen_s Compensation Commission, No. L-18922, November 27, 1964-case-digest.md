I. CAPTION
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and JUAN TIVAR, G.R. No. L-18922, November 27, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Juan Tivar was employed as a carpenter by the National Development Company (NDC) in 1948. He was laid off in 1950 due to failing health, receiving a gratuity, but was re-employed later that year after being found fit for work [1]. In late 1952, while carrying a wooden post, Tivar slipped and the post clipped his back, causing dizziness and hemoptysis. He continued working until March 31, 1953, when he was laid off after an X-ray revealed he was suffering from active pulmonary tuberculosis [2].

One month after his layoff, Tivar made a verbal demand for compensation, which NDC refused. He subsequently filed formal claims in 1957 and 1960 [3]. The Hearing Officer awarded compensation, and the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed the award, including reimbursement for medical expenses [4]. NDC appealed, arguing the claim was barred by prescription under Section 24 of Act No. 3428 and that Tivar was not totally disabled as he could still undertake "contracting carpentry jobs" [3, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claim for compensation is barred by prescription under Section 24 of Act No. 3428.
2. W/N Tivar is entitled to compensation for total disability.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the claim was not barred. The verbal demand made by Tivar hardly a month after he was laid off constituted substantial compliance with Section 24 of Act No. 3428 [4]. Furthermore, considering Tivar was laid off in 1953 for virtually the same reason as in 1950 (when he received a gratuity), the prior gratuity could be viewed as falling under the legal provisions that render a formal claim unnecessary within the prescribed period [5].

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the award for total disability. The WCC found Tivar was totally disabled for the specific kind of carpentry work he performed for the petitioner for many years. The fact that Tivar could subsequently undertake "contracting carpentry jobs" did not negate this finding, as such work is entirely different from doing actual manual carpentry [5].

The appealed decision is affirmed [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., and Zaldivar concurred with the decision [7].
