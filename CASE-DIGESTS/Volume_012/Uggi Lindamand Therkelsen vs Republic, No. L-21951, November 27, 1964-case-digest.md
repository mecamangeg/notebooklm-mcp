I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF THE MINOR CHARLES JOSEPH BLANCAFLOR WEEKS. UGGI LINDAMAND THERKELSEN and ERLINDA G. BLANCAFLOR v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21951, November 27, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Uggi Lindamand Therkelsen, a Danish subject and permanent resident of the Philippines, and his wife Erlinda G. Blancaflor, a Filipino, sought to adopt Charles Joseph Blancaflor Weeks. The minor was Erlinda's natural child who had been abandoned by his natural father. The Manila Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court (JDRC) denied the petition. The lower court ruled that an alien could not adopt a Filipino unless the adoption would confer the alien's citizenship upon the minor. Since the adoption would not result in the minor losing Filipino citizenship or acquiring Danish citizenship, the JDRC held that Therkelsen was disqualified from adopting the child [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a resident alien is disqualified from adopting a Filipino minor if the adoption does not confer the adopter's citizenship upon the adopted child.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that alienage by itself does not disqualify a foreigner from adopting under Philippine law. Article 335 of the Civil Code only disqualifies aliens who are: (a) non-residents; or (b) residents who are subjects of a government with which the Republic of the Philippines has broken diplomatic relations [4, 5]. The petitioners did not fall under either disqualification.

The Court further held that it is not a condition for adoption that the process result in the acquisition of the adopter's citizenship by the adopted child. Citing *Ching Leng v. Galang*, the Court emphasized that citizenship is a political matter outside the ambit of the Civil Code, and the courts cannot impose prerequisites for adoption beyond those required by law [6, 7].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the lower court is directed to allow the adoption [8].
