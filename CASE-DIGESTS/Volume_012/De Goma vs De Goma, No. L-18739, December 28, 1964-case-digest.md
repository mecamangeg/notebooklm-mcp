I. CAPTION
SILVINO DE GOMA v. ROSARIO DE GOMA, et al., G.R. No. L-18739, December 28, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Beatriz Mendoza obtained a default judgment for a sum of money against Rosario de Goma. Silvino de Goma, Rosario's husband, was joined as a party-defendant in that suit. A certificate of public convenience (CPC) in Rosario's name was levied upon and sold at public auction to Jose Montalvo, Jr. on June 22, 1959 [1]. Subsequently, Rosario and Silvino filed Civil Case No. 42787 to annul the sale, arguing the CPC was not leviable property. The lower court dismissed this complaint, upholding the sale's validity, and the decision became final [2]. On April 11, 1961, Silvino, acting alone as administrator of the conjugal partnership, filed the present action to annul the same sale on a new ground: that the CPC was conjugal property and Rosario had contracted the underlying debt without his consent [3]. The lower court dismissed the complaint on the ground of *res judicata* [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the present action to annul the execution sale is barred by *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the doctrine of *res judicata* applies because the cause of action in both cases is the same: the alleged legal wrong of the execution sale, and the relief prayed for is identical (annulment of sale) [4]. While the grounds for annulment differed, they do not constitute distinct causes of action [4]. Under Section 49(b), Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court, *res judicata* applies not only to points actually adjudged but to every point which belonged to the subject of litigation and which the parties might have brought forward with reasonable diligence at the time [4, 5]. The questions regarding the conjugal nature of the property and the husband's consent were defenses that should have been raised in the first annulment case [6]. To allow this suit would violate the prohibition against splitting a single cause of action under Sections 3 and 4 of Rule 2 [6].

The order appealed from is affirmed [7].
