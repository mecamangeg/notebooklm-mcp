I. CAPTION
ANANIAS ABUSTAN v. RUPERTO FERRER and CONSUELO V. GOLEZ, G.R. No. L-19519, November 28, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Vicente Gomez executed an unregistered mortgage in favor of Spouses Ferrer to guarantee a P2,500 loan [1]. The Spouses Ferrer later filed a civil case (No. 4820) against Gomez for the recovery of the sum of money, but it was dismissed for failure to prosecute [2]. Subsequently, they filed another case (No. 5726) for the conveyance of the property, which was also dismissed on the ground of *res judicata* based on the first dismissal [3].

Despite these dismissals, the Spouses Ferrer executed an affidavit of adverse claim based on the mortgage, which was annotated on the title [3]. The property was later transferred to Ananias Abustan (Petitioner), who filed a petition under Section 112 of the Land Registration Act (Act 496) to cancel the adverse claim. Abustan argued that the Ferrers' rights had been extinguished by the final judgments in the civil cases [4]. The lower court granted the petition. The Spouses Ferrer appealed, arguing that the summary proceeding was improper and their rights subsisted [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal of the prior civil actions extinguished the mortgage and the basis for the adverse claim.
2. W/N the cancellation of the adverse claim was properly ordered via a summary proceeding under Section 112 of the Land Registration Act.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The dismissal of the collection case (No. 4820) for non-appearance of the parties constituted an adjudication on the merits under Rule 17, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, effectively extinguishing the principal debt [6, 7]. Under **Article 2085 of the Civil Code**, a mortgage is merely an accessory contract and cannot exist without the principal obligation it seeks to guarantee. Consequently, the extinction of the debt necessarily extinguished the mortgage and any right to conveyance or adverse claim predicated upon it [8].

2. **YES.** The cancellation was properly sought under Section 112 of the Land Registration Act. While controversial issues regarding registered land generally require an ordinary action, this rule does not apply when the facts are undisputed [7]. In this case, there was no controversy regarding the final dismissal of the previous civil cases or the grounds thereof. Since the legal status of the claim was resolved by the finality of the prior judgments, the Land Registration Court could validly order the cancellation [7].

The Order appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
