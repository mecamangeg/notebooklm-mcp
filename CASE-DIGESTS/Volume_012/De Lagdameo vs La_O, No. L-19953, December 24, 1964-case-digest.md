I. CAPTION
PILAR REVILLA DE LAGDAMEO v. JUAN LA’O, G.R. No. L-19953, December 24, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On November 5, 1955, petitioner Pilar Revilla De Lagdameo filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila for the guardianship of her nieces, the minors Trinidad and Bettina Revilla La’O. Respondent Juan La’O, the minors' father, opposed the petition and sought custody [1]. Republic Act No. 1401, which created the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court (JDRC) and granted it exclusive original jurisdiction over guardianship cases, was approved on September 9, 1955 [2]. However, the JDRC was not organized until June 1, 1956 [3].

The CFI heard the case and rendered judgment appointing the petitioner as guardian [4]. Respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA dismissed the petition, ruling that the CFI lacked jurisdiction because RA 1401 had already conferred exclusive jurisdiction to the JDRC upon the law's approval [2, 4]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that jurisdiction was not transferred until the actual organization of the JDRC [2, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance of Manila had jurisdiction over a guardianship case filed after the approval of Republic Act No. 1401 but before the organization of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the CFI retained jurisdiction. Although Section 1 of RA 1401 grants exclusive jurisdiction to the JDRC, Section 2 provides that pending cases shall be transferred "upon the organization" of said court [5]. The Court held that the effect of Section 2 was to defer the operation of the grant of authority until the JDRC was actually organized on June 1, 1956 [3, 5].

To rule otherwise would create a jurisdictional "vacuum" in Manila between the law's approval (September 9, 1955) and the court's organization (June 1, 1956), leaving no judicial body competent to hear such cases [6]. The Court presumed Congress did not intend to create such a vacuum inimical to public interest [6].

The decision of the Court of Appeals was **REVERSED**, and the case was remanded to the CA for a decision on the merits [7].
