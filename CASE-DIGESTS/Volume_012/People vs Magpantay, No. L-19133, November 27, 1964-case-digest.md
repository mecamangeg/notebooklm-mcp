I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FELIX MAGPANTAY and EUGENIO ALCARAZ, G.R. No. L-19133, November 27, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On June 2, 1959, accused Felix Magpantay, Eugenio Alcaraz, and their cohorts, armed with unlicensed carbines, ambushed a passenger jeepney in Bongabon, Oriental Mindoro, killing ten passengers. They were charged with multiple murder. Magpantay and Alcaraz pleaded guilty to the Information, which alleged treachery, evident premeditation, and superior strength.

The Court of First Instance of Oriental Mindoro convicted them. While the court appreciated the mitigating circumstance of the plea of guilty, it rejected the additional claim of voluntary surrender because the accused had fled to the mountains after the crime. Consequently, considering the aggravating circumstances, the trial court sentenced them to death. The case was elevated to the Supreme Court for review, with the accused arguing they should be credited with voluntary surrender and, for Magpantay, lack of instruction. Evidence showed that after the crime, the accused attempted to surrender to various barrio lieutenants who refused them, before finally arranging surrender through the Mayor and PC officers.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender should be appreciated despite the accused's flight from the scene.
2. W/N lack of instruction should be appreciated as a mitigating circumstance for Magpantay.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the flight of the accused to the mountains did not belie their *bona fide* intention to surrender. The unrebutted evidence showed they took early steps to surrender by seeking out local officials. They defied no law or agent of authority and surrendered with "meekness and repentance" once arrangements were made [1, 2]. The fact that authorities waited at designated places to receive them confirmed the surrender was voluntary and not a capture [1].

2. **NO.** The Court rejected the claim of lack of instruction. Magpantay's answers to questions during the proceedings demonstrated that he understood the significance of his acts despite his illiteracy [3].

**Disposition:** The Court further ruled that while the Information's narration mentioned nocturnity and band, only evident premeditation and superior strength were reiterated in the specific paragraph listing aggravating circumstances. To avoid misleading the accused, only the latter two were considered [3]. These two aggravating circumstances were offset by the two mitigating circumstances (plea of guilty and voluntary surrender). The judgment was **MODIFIED**; the death penalty was reduced to *reclusion perpetua* for each of the ten murders, subject to the 40-year limit under Article 70 of the Revised Penal Code [4].
