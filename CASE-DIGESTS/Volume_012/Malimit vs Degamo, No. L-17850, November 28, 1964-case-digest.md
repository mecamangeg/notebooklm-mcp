I. CAPTION
JOSE MALIMIT v. ESTEBAN DEGAMO, G.R. Nos. L-17850 & L-17851, November 28, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In the November 10, 1959 general elections, Jose Malimit and Esteban Degamo were opposing candidates for Mayor of Carmen, Agusan. Initially, the Board of Canvassers proclaimed Malimit as mayor-elect, but this was nullified by the Commission on Elections. On December 7, 1959, the reconstituted Board proclaimed Degamo as mayor-elect.

On December 14, 1959, Malimit mailed a petition for *quo warranto* to the Clerk of the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan challenging Degamo’s right to office. However, the required docket fees were only paid on January 5, 1960. The CFI dismissed the *quo warranto* petition for being filed out of time and for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that the petition was deemed filed only upon payment of the docket fees, which occurred after the one-week reglementary period. The CFI also dismissed a separate election protest filed by Malimit for failure to prosecute. Malimit appealed the dismissal orders.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for *quo warranto* was filed within the reglementary period despite the late payment of docket fees.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. Under Section 173 of the Revised Election Code, a petition for *quo warranto* must be filed within one week after the proclamation. While Malimit mailed the original petition within the one-week period (December 14, 1959, relative to the December 7 proclamation), the docket fees were not paid until January 5, 1960.

The Court held that the date of payment of docket fees must be deemed the real date of filing, not the date of mailing. Before the payment of docket fees, a case is not deemed duly registered and docketed. Citing *Lazaro v. Endencia* and *In the matter of the petition for citizenship of Jimmy Lee*, the Court ruled that since the fees were paid after the expiration of the one-week period, the petition was filed out of time. The dismissal of the election protest for failure to prosecute was also upheld.

Orders affirmed.
