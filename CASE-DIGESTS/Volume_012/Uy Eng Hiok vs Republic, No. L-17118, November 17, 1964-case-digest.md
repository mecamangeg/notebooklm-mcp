I. CAPTION
IN RE PETITION FOR ACQUISITION OF PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP, UY ENG HIOK, alias FORTUNATO UY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17118, November 17, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Uy Eng Hiok, a citizen of China born in 1934, arrived in the Philippines in 1938 and has resided in Dalaguete, Cebu. He filed a petition for naturalization, claiming he was single and employed by his father as an associate and agent in the latter’s business with a monthly salary of P140.00. The Court of First Instance of Cebu denied the petition, finding, among other things, that he did not possess sufficient knowledge of English. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner satisfied the requirement of having a lucrative occupation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the petitioner's monthly income of P140.00, even if assumed true, does not satisfy the legal requirement of a lucrative occupation. The Court noted that in recent decisions, even monthly salaries of P200.00 were held inadequate considering the low purchasing power of money [1]. Furthermore, the evidence of employment was unsatisfactory; it consisted only of petitioner's self-serving testimony and hearsay from witnesses, and he failed to present the business payroll despite the lower court's request [2].

The Court further ruled that the applicant failed to meet his burden of proving all qualifications and no disqualifications [2]. The petition was rightfully denied on the following additional grounds: failure to attach the Certificate of Arrival to the declaration of intention (citing *Yang Nang v. Republic*), insufficient knowledge of English, lack of evidence regarding publication in the Official Gazette, and the unauthorized use of the alias "Hioga" in violation of the Anti-Alias Law [2].

The judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED, with costs against appellant.
