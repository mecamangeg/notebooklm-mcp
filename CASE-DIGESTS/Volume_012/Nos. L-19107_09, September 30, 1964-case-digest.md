I. CAPTION
Lao Yap Han Diok, Lao Yap Han Pick alias Antonio Lao Rolida, and Francisco Lao Rolida alias Lao Yap Khing v. Republic of the Philippines, G.R. Nos. L-19107-09, September 30, 1964, Paredes, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioners Lao Yap Han Diok, Lao Yap Han Pick, and Francisco Lao Rolida filed separate petitions for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Maasin, Leyte [2, 3]. During the proceedings, petitioners filed motions to dismiss their own petitions for naturalization, praying instead that the court make a judicial declaration that they are Filipino citizens [4]. In support, they presented the baptismal certificate and birth record of their father, Pedro Rolida, indicating he was a Filipino, and presented him as a witness [4, 5]. The CFI rendered decisions dismissing the petitions for naturalization "for being unnecessary" but categorically declared the petitioners to be Filipino citizens [6, 7]. The Republic appealed, arguing, among other errors, that the trial court had no power or authority to declare the petitioners Filipino citizens in such proceedings [2, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court can validly make a judicial declaration of Filipino citizenship in a petition for naturalization. [1, 8]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that a judicial declaration that a person is a Filipino citizen cannot be made in a petition for naturalization [1]. Under Philippine laws, there can be no action or proceeding for the judicial declaration of the citizenship of an individual [1, 9]. The Court reasoned that courts of justice exist for the settlement of justiciable controversies involving demandable rights and remedies, and while a finding of citizenship may be made as a necessary premise to justify a given relief (e.g., in settling land ownership), there is no legislation authorizing the institution of a judicial proceeding to declare that a given person is part of the citizenry [9].

The Court expressly relied on the ruling in *Danilo Channie Tan v. Republic* and *Paralan v. Republic*, noting that these cases overruled previous doctrines (such as *Pablo y Sen v. Republic*) that permitted such declarations [8, 10]. Consequently, the lower court’s pronouncement was unnecessary and beyond its judicial power [10].

The decisions of the lower court are **AFFIRMED** insofar as they dismissed the petitions for naturalization, but **REVERSED** insofar as they declared the petitioners Filipino citizens [10].
