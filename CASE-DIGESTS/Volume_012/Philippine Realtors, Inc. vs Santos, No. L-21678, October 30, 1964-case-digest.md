I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE REALTORS, INC. v. HON. GUILLERMO SANTOS and REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21678, October 30, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Philippine Realtors, Inc. (petitioner) secured writs of execution and demolition from the Municipal Court against occupants of its property. However, on August 5, 1963, the Land Tenure Administration (representing the Republic) filed a complaint for expropriation in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila covering the subject property—a 2.5-hectare parcel of land formerly part of the Hacienda Tuazon. The complaint alleged the land was occupied by more than 40 tenant-families and was being expropriated for subdivision and resale to them pursuant to Republic Acts No. 1400, 1162, and 3516. Respondent Judge Santos issued an order restraining the ejectment and demolition. Petitioner filed the present action to prohibit the CFI from proceeding with the condemnation case.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the 2.5-hectare parcel of land constitutes a "landed estate" that may be validly expropriated by the government for resale to tenants.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the condemnation of the subject land is inappropriate and impermissible. Citing *Republic v. Manotok Realty* (G.R. No. L-20204, July 31, 1964), the Court ruled that small pieces of urban land are not expropriable merely because they are occupied by tenants. For a property to be considered a "landed estate" within the meaning of Article XIII, Section 4 of the Constitution, its area or extension must be taken into account, not necessarily the number of tenants.

The Court emphasized that the Legislature cannot, by legislative fiat, declare a parcel of land to be a landed estate simply because it formerly formed part of one. Since the subject property is only 2.5 hectares, it falls outside the purview of the constitutional provision allowing expropriation for resale.

The Order of the lower court is **SET ASIDE**. The Court of First Instance of Manila is prohibited from proceeding with the condemnation case and ordered to **DISMISS** the same.
