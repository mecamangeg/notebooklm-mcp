I. CAPTION
PERFECTO LIMCHAYPO, ET AL. v. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19528, December 29, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Limchaypo, Ceballos, Terado, and others were municipal policemen of Dagami, Leyte. On July 1, 1953, they were extended promotional appointments which were approved by the Commissioner of Civil Service and the Office of the President as "Temporary, under section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code" (valid for 3 months). Limchaypo’s appointment was specifically approved as "temporary pending receipt of the required medical certificate." On February 6, 1956, their services were terminated by the newly-elected municipal mayor, and they were replaced by non-eligibles.

Petitioners filed a *quo warranto* case, claiming security of tenure based on veteran preference (Republic Act Nos. 65 and 1363) and, for Limchaypo, civil service eligibility. The Court of First Instance of Leyte ruled in their favor, but the Court of Appeals reversed the decision. During the pendency of the case, petitioners were reinstated in 1959, limiting the issue to their entitlement to salaries during the period of their separation (1956-1959).

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the termination of the petitioners' services was illegal given their claims of veteran preference and civil service eligibility.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision.

Regarding the claim of veteran preference, the Court ruled that the preference granted under Section 8 of Republic Act No. 65 expired three years from its passage (October 18, 1949). Since the respondents were appointed to the vacancies in 1956, the petitioners could no longer invoke this privilege. Furthermore, petitioners failed to secure the necessary certification as veterans under Republic Act No. 1363.

Regarding the nature of their appointments, the Court held that the petitioners' unconditional acceptance of promotional appointments marked as "temporary" under Section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code removed them from the constitutional protection of security of tenure. A temporary appointment is valid only for three months, making their subsequent removal lawful.

Specific to petitioner Limchaypo, although he possessed civil service eligibility (retroactively applied under R.A. 1079), his acceptance of a temporary appointment waived his security of tenure. Moreover, his appointment was conditional ("pending receipt of the required medical certificate"). As physical fitness is essential for government employment (Sec. 663(c), Revised Administrative Code), his failure to submit the certificate rendered his appointment temporary, and his removal was not illegal.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
