I. CAPTION
THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, AMANDO JOSON, VICTORIA BALMEO, ANTONIO BUSUEGO, and ROGELIO BUSUEGO v. TEODORA BUSUEGO, G.R. No. L-19090, December 28, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On March 13, 1961, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Nueva Ecija rendered a decision in a cadastral case adjudicating a lot in favor of respondent Teodora Busuego. A decree of registration was subsequently issued on April 15, 1961 [1]. Within the one-year period allowed by law, petitioners-appellants (spouses Joson and the Busuego nephews) filed petitions in the same proceeding on May 12, 1961, seeking to set aside the decree and cancel the certificate of title [1]. They alleged that Teodora obtained the decree through fraud and misrepresentation by claiming to be the sole owner, despite the petitioners owning portions of the land through purchase and succession [1, 2]. On August 4, 1961, the CFI dismissed the petitions, ruling that as a cadastral court with limited jurisdiction, it had no authority to pass upon the issues raised, and that relief should be sought in a court exercising general jurisdiction under Section 38 of the Land Registration Act [3]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance, acting as a cadastral court, has jurisdiction to hear a petition to review a decree of registration filed within one year of its issuance under Section 38 of Act 496.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the petitions were properly filed with the cadastral court. While Section 38 of Act 496 mentions the "competent Court of First Instance," this does not require the court to exercise its general jurisdiction to the exclusion of its capacity as a land registration court [4]. The adjudication of land in a registration or cadastral case does not become final and incontrovertible until the expiration of one year from the entry of the final decree [4]. Until this one-year period elapses, the decision remains under the control and sound discretion of the court that rendered it, which may set aside the decree after a hearing [4]. Since the petitions alleging fraud were filed within one year from the issuance of the decree, they are cognizable by the court that rendered the decision (*Capio v. Capio*) [4, 5].

The order of dismissal was **set aside**, and the case was **remanded** to the lower court for further proceedings [5].
