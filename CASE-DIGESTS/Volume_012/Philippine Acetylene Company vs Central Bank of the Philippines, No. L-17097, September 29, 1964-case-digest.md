I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE ACETYLENE COMPANY v. CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17097, September 29, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In September 1955, Philippine Acetylene Company paid foreign exchange taxes totaling P6,507.87 to the Central Bank for the importation of ten skid tanks used to transport and store liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) [1]. Plaintiff purchased LPG in bulk from Caltex and retailed it to consumers using these specialized pressure vessels to keep the gas in a liquid state [2, 3]. Plaintiff claimed a refund under Section 2 of Republic Act No. 601, as amended, which exempts foreign exchange used for importing machinery and equipment "for the use of industries" [2, 4]. The Central Bank denied the refund, arguing that the plaintiff was merely a merchant or dealer, not engaged in a manufacturing industry, and that the tanks were not indispensable [3, 5]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the plaintiff, ordering the Central Bank to refund the taxes [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the importation of skid tanks falls within the tax exemption for "industries" under Section 2 of R.A. No. 601.
2. W/N the action for recovery of tax may be properly directed against the Central Bank.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the term "industries" in R.A. No. 601 is not limited to manufacturing industries [6, 7]. Since the law did not qualify the term, it should not be given a restricted interpretation, consistent with the government's intent to encourage industrialization [7]. The Court found that the plaintiff's operations—which involved technical skills, pumps, regulators, and special pressurized containers to package and distribute LPG—constituted a "packaging industry" [7]. Furthermore, under the exemption, it is not necessary for the equipment to be "indispensable" to the industry; it is sufficient that they are "used" for it [7, 8].

2. **YES.** The Central Bank is the proper party defendant because it is a corporate entity with the power to sue and be sued under Section 4 of R.A. No. 265 [9, 10]. Moreover, Section 5 of R.A. No. 601 explicitly directs that refunds of such taxes be made by the Central Bank [10, 11].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed *in toto* [12].
