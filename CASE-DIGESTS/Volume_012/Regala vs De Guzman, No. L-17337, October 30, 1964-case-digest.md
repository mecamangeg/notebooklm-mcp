I. CAPTION
FELISA REGALA v. MARGARITA DE GUZMAN and THE HON. ARSENIO H. LACSON, Mayor of the City of Manila, G.R. No. L-17337, October 30, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Felisa Regala and respondent Margarita de Guzman were stallholders in the Paco Market, Manila. Following a re-arrangement of stalls by the Market Committee, Regala was assigned stalls previously occupied by others, while De Guzman was ordered to transfer to vacant corner stalls. De Guzman protested. After several endorsements and a review of the facts—noting that another stallholder was allowed to retain her position under similar circumstances—Mayor Lacson overruled the Market Committee. He ordered that De Guzman be allowed to occupy her former position, citing fairness and equity.

Regala filed a petition for certiorari with injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, alleging grave abuse of discretion by the Mayor. The CFI dismissed the petition without receiving evidence, ruling that the awarding of market stalls is purely administrative and within the Mayor's powers. Regala appealed, arguing the court erred in dismissing the petition without a hearing.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in dismissing the petition for certiorari without a hearing.
2. W/N the petitioner exhausted administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the awarding of market stalls is purely administrative and falls within the powers of the City Mayor. Under Section 9 of Republic Act No. 409 (Revised Charter of the City of Manila), the Mayor has immediate control over executive functions. Furthermore, Section 49 of the Market Code (Ordinance No. 2898) declares the Mayor's decision on appeals from city officials as final. The Court ruled that it is not mandatory for courts to hear a petition for certiorari where, from the allegations themselves, the petition appears to be without merit [Arvisu v. Vergara, G.R. No. L-3934]. No abuse of authority was proven in the Mayor's decision to ensure fairness among stallholders.

2. **NO.** The Court noted that the suit must fail because Regala did not exhaust her administrative remedies. The "competent legal authorities" referred to in the Market Code regarding the finality of the Mayor's decision implies supervision by the President (formerly Secretary of the Interior). Consequently, the Mayor's decision should have been appealed to the Office of the President before resorting to judicial review.

Decision affirmed.
