I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE ROCK PRODUCTS, INC. v. MAYON MINING CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-19602, October 30, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Philippine Rock Products, Inc. filed a collection suit against defendant Mayon Mining Corporation. In its original answer, Mayon admitted *leasing* a tractor and other equipment from the plaintiff. However, Mayon subsequently filed a Motion for Leave to Amend Answer, attaching an Amended Answer which claimed it had *bought* the tractor, effectively changing its defense theory. The trial court admitted the amended answer but eventually rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff.

When Mayon filed its Record on Appeal, the plaintiff opposed it for failing to include the original answer, the motion to amend, and the order admitting the amendment. The trial court ordered Mayon to include these pleadings. Mayon appealed this order to the Supreme Court, arguing that these pleadings were unnecessary since the propriety of admitting the amended answer was not being raised as an error on appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the original answer and pleadings related to its amendment must be included in the Record on Appeal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the lower court was correct in ordering the inclusion of the pleadings. Under **Section 6, Rule 41** of the Rules of Court, the Record on Appeal must include "copies of only such pleadings, petitions, motions and all interlocutory orders as are related to the appealed order or judgment and necessary for the proper understanding of the issue involved."

The Court reasoned that the pleadings in question were necessary to reveal that the defendant-appellant had adopted a position antithetical to its former stand and had initially filed an answer without ascertaining the true facts. These pleadings were deemed essential for the proper understanding of the issues involved in the case [1-3].

The appeal was **DISMISSED** for being wholly devoid of merit, with double costs against the defendant-appellant.
