I. CAPTION
R.F. SUGAY & CO., INC. v. PABLO C. REYES, CESAR CURATA, PACIFIC PRODUCTS, INC., and WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-20451, December 28, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Claimants Pablo C. Reyes and Cesar Curata suffered injuries while painting the office of respondent Pacific Products, Inc. and filed a claim for workmen’s compensation [1]. The Hearing Officer initially ruled that Pacific Products, Inc. was liable as the employer [2]. However, the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed this, finding that petitioner R.F. Sugay & Co., Inc. was the statutory employer and absolving Pacific Products, Inc. [2].

Evidence showed the claimants were hired by Rodolfo Babatid, an employee of the petitioner, pursuant to instructions from Romulo Sugay (Petitioner's President) [3]. They were supervised and paid by Eduardo Sugay (Petitioner's Secretary) and signed the company payroll [3, 4]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that Romulo Sugay acted individually as an agent for Pacific Products, distinct from the corporation, or that Pacific Products was the true employer [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N R.F. Sugay & Co., Inc. is the statutory employer liable for the compensation.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the WCC's findings, holding that the decisive elements of an employer-employee relationship—selection and engagement, payment of wages, power of dismissal, and control—were lodged in R.F. Sugay & Co., Inc., not Pacific Products, Inc. [7]. The Court cited *Viaña v. Alejo-Alagadan* regarding these elements [7].

The Court rejected the petitioner's defense that Romulo Sugay acted in a separate capacity from the corporation. The Court ruled that R.F. Sugay & Co. was a mere business conduit of Romulo Sugay [8]. It applied the principle that when the veil of corporate fiction is used as a shield to perpetrate fraud or confuse legitimate issues (such as the employer-employee relationship), the veil must be pierced [6]. The dual roles of the President cannot be allowed to confuse the facts; thus, the corporation is liable [6].

The writ was denied, and the judgment appealed from was affirmed [8].
