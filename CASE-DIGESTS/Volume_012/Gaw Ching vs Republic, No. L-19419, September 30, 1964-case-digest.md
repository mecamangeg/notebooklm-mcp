I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF GAW CHING TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, GAW CHING v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19419, September 30, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Gaw Ching filed a petition for naturalization, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Manila [1, 2]. The Solicitor General appealed the decision on the grounds that the petitioner failed to comply with Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law and that his character witnesses were insufficient [2]. Gaw Ching admitted that he omitted his former place of residence (No. 512 Asuncion Street, Manila) in his application but argued this was due to inadvertence [3]. He contended the omission was not fatal because his former address was nearby his present residence (No. 699 Asuncion Street, Manila) and would not have materially affected the government's investigation [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to state a former place of residence in the petition for naturalization is fatal.
2. W/N the character witnesses presented satisfied the legal requirement of being "credible persons."

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that Section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 (Revised Naturalization Law) requires the disclosure of "former places of residence," and failure to do so is fatal [3, 4]. The Court rejected the petitioner's argument that the proximity of the addresses rendered the error harmless [3]. In a densely populated section of Manila, even a short distance can significantly affect the success of a background investigation [3]. Non-compliance is assumed to impair the investigation unless proven otherwise [3].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner's witnesses, Salvador Estenzo and Benjamin Amog, did not meet the standard of "credible persons" required by law [5, 6]. A "credible person" is not merely someone without a criminal record, but an individual with good standing in the community who is known to be honest, upright, and trustworthy [5]. The witnesses' testimonies were too general to satisfactorily attest to the petitioner's qualifications [6, 7]. Furthermore, witness Amog gave contradictory testimony regarding when and where he first met the petitioner, further undermining his credibility [6].

The decision of the Court of First Instance is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DENIED** [8].
