I. CAPTION
ALAN A. BAKEWELL v. JUDGE JOSE T. LLOREN, G.R. No. L-20108, December 28, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alan A. Bakewell was the general superintendent of the Baguio Gold Mining Company. Respondent Judge Jose T. Lloren, the Justice of the Peace of Itogon, Benguet, was conducting a preliminary examination within the company's compound. During the proceedings, Bakewell interrupted and insulted a witness. Judge Lloren suspended the proceedings and cited Bakewell to show cause why he should not be held in contempt. Instead of appearing personally, Bakewell submitted a written explanation through his counsel. Judge Lloren considered the explanation improper, set a hearing requiring Bakewell's appearance, and upon his failure to appear, issued a warrant of arrest pursuant to Section 3, Rule 64 of the Rules of Court. Bakewell was arrested but subsequently released after the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Baguio City issued a writ of preliminary injunction in a certiorari petition filed by Bakewell. The CFI ruled that Judge Lloren abused his discretion in issuing the warrant and made the injunction permanent. Judge Lloren appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a judge may validly issue a warrant of arrest to compel the personal appearance of a party charged with contempt who has already filed a written answer through counsel.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court, holding that the issuance of the warrant was an abuse of discretion.

The Court relied on the doctrine in *Francisco v. Enriquez* (G.R. No. L-7058), which established that when an accused appears by counsel and submits an explanation, it is an abuse of discretion to insist on personal appearance unless the accused is the only one who can provide a legally admissible answer. The Court clarified that the answer need not be under oath, as the Rules of Court do not require verification for a contempt answer signed by counsel; under Section 5, Rule 15 of the old Rules of Court, an attorney's signature constitutes a certificate that there is good ground to support the pleading.

Furthermore, citing *Esparagoza v. Tan* (G.R. No. L-6525), the Court held that the power to compel personal appearance under Section 3, Rule 64 can only be exercised if "good reasons exist justifying it." In this case, no sufficient reason existed because Bakewell had already tendered an explanation. If the judge found the explanation unsatisfactory, the proper course was to proceed with the contempt proceedings or, if the explanation was insolent, take appropriate criminal or administrative action.

**Decision affirmed.**
