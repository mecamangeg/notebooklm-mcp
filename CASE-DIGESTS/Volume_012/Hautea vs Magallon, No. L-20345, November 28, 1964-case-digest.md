I. CAPTION
RICARDO HAUTEA v. RAMON S. MAGALLON and MANUEL SORIANO, G.R. No. L-20345, November 28, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On January 9, 1962, respondent Manuel Soriano filed a complaint for illegal detainer and damages against petitioner Ricardo Hautea in the Justice of the Peace Court of Zarraga, Iloilo. Soriano alleged that Hautea, as lessee of his agricultural land, violated their lease contract by allowing unauthorized persons to reside on the property and by destroying saltbeds and rice land to convert them into a fishpond, causing deterioration [1, 2]. The complaint averred that Soriano demanded the restoration of the land and the turnover of possession in December 1961, but Hautea refused [2].

Hautea moved to dismiss, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction because the complaint failed to allege the date of the breach (to determine the one-year period) and that the action was essentially for rescission of contract, which falls under the Court of First Instance (CFI) [3]. The Justice of the Peace denied the motion. Hautea filed a petition for certiorari with the CFI of Iloilo, which was dismissed [4]. Hautea appealed to the Supreme Court, raising a new argument that the complaint was defective for failing to allege a specific demand to comply with the lease conditions [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Justice of the Peace Court has jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. The Court ruled that the complaint sufficiently alleged the necessary jurisdictional facts. The allegation that "in spite of the demands made by the plaintiff, the defendant had refused to restore the riceland... into its original condition" effectively pleaded a prior demand on the lessee to comply with the conditions of the lease [6, 7].

The Court held that the violation of lease terms—specifically devoting the leased thing to a non-stipulated use that causes deterioration—coupled with a demand for compliance and return of the premises, renders the lessee's possession unlawful. This entitles the lessor to an action for ejectment under Article 1673 of the Civil Code and Rule 70, Section 1 of the Revised Rules of Court [8]. The Court further noted that Hautea impermissibly changed his theory on appeal by raising defects regarding the demand that were not pleaded in the lower court [7].

The Order of the Court of First Instance is affirmed [9].
