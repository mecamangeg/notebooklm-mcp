**I. CAPTION**
PERFECTO FAYPON v. SALVADOR L. MARIÑO, FELICISIMO R. ROSETE and ALEJANDRO E. SEBASTIAN, G.R. No. L-20304, October 30, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Perfecto Faypon, the Director of the Philippine Virginia Tobacco Administration, was suspended from office by an order of the Executive Secretary dated September 6, 1962 [1]. Faypon filed a petition to annul the suspension order, compel his reinstatement, and enjoin the administrative investigation against him [1]. On December 21, 1962, the Supreme Court granted a mandatory injunction for his reinstatement, noting that the suspension period had become unreasonable and that his term was set to expire on January 3, 1963 [2]. Faypon posted the required bond and the writ was issued [3]. However, Faypon's term of office expired on January 3, 1963, and he was not reappointed to the position [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petition for reinstatement and annulment of the suspension order has become moot.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court held that the case had become moot and academic. It was admitted that the petitioner's term of office expired on January 3, 1963, and he was not reappointed [3]. A petition for reinstatement to a public office becomes moot upon the expiration of the petitioner’s term of office without reappointment during the pendency of the case [4, 5]. Consequently, the case was dismissed [3].
