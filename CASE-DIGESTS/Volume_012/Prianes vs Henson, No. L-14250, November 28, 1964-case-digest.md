I. CAPTION
MARIA LOURDES PRIANES v. FERMIN HENSON, G.R. No. L-14250, November 28, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On September 28, 1955, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila ordered defendant Fermin Henson to pay P250.00 monthly support to the minor plaintiff, Maria Lourdes Prianes, starting June 19, 1952. Henson appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA). Prianes sought execution pending appeal, which the CFI granted unless Henson filed a supersedeas bond. Henson and the First National Surety & Assurance Co., Inc. (Surety) filed a P10,000.00 bond conditioned on the satisfaction of the judgment if affirmed.

The CA subsequently modified the decision, reducing the monthly support to P100.00 but affirming it in all other respects. A writ of execution was issued. The Surety filed a motion to fix its liability at P4,000.00, arguing that since the monthly support was reduced from P250.00 to P100.00, its liability should be proportionately reduced to cover only the accrued support based on the lower amount. The CFI denied the motion. The Surety appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the reduction of the amount of monthly support by the Court of Appeals results in a corresponding proportionate reduction of the surety’s liability on the supersedeas bond.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of the trial court. The Court held that the principle in forcible entry and detainer cases—where a supersedeas bond is answerable only for damages down to the perfection of the appeal (under Section 8, Rule 70)—is not applicable to actions for support.

Instead, the general rule under Section 3, Rule 39 applies, which states that the supersedeas bond is for the performance of the judgment or order appealed from in case it be affirmed wholly or in part. The Surety obligated itself to pay the full amount of P10,000.00 if the judgment was not strictly voided; the bond terms did not provide for a proportionate reduction in case of modification. Furthermore, since the judgment required support until the minor reached majority, the total sum involved would exceed the bond amount. Even calculating the accrued support at the reduced rate of P100.00 plus attorney's fees, the total was approximately P9,000.00, justifying the bond's coverage.

The order appealed from is affirmed.
