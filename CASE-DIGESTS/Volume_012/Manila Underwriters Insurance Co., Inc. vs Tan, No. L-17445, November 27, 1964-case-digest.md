I. CAPTION
MANILA UNDERWRITERS INSURANCE CO., INC., petitioner, vs. HON. BIENVENIDO A. TAN, in his capacity as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch XIII and JOSE DE BORJA, respondents, G.R. No. L-17445, November 27, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In Civil Case No. 12796 (Tumambing v. De Borja), the trial court issued a writ of preliminary attachment against respondent De Borja based on an P8,000 bond executed by petitioner Manila Underwriters [1]. Petitioner was not impleaded nor notified of the counterclaim or trial [2]. Judgment was rendered in 1954 and affirmed by the Court of Appeals. In 1957, De Borja moved for execution against the petitioner. Petitioner opposed citing lack of notice under Rule 59, Sec. 20 (now Rule 57), but the trial court granted execution [2]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-12256), which rendered judgment in its favor on April 29, 1960 [2]. Despite this final ruling, the respondent Judge issued subsequent orders on August 30 and September 10, 1960, attempting to hold petitioner liable on the bond [3]. Petitioner filed for certiorari and prohibition.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner may still be held liable on its bond despite the previous Supreme Court decision in G.R. No. L-12256.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the question of whether the petitioner could still be held liable on its bond was already finally settled by the Court in the previous case, G.R. No. L-12256 [4]. Consequently, any attempt to hold the petitioner liable upon the same bond is an improper attempt to reopen a case that has already been finally adjudicated (*res judicata*) [5, 6].

The petition was granted, and the orders complained of were declared void and of no legal force and effect [4].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS (if any)
Justices Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon J.P., and Zaldivar concurred [7].
