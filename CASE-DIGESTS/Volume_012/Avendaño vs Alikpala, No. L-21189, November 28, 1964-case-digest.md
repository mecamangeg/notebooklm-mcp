**I. CAPTION**
**JOSE AVENDAÑO and MARTA AVENDAÑO v. THE HON. FEDERICO G. ALIKPALA, THE SHERIFF OF MANILA, THE MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and LUZVIMINDA PARUNGAO SAN PEDRO, G.R. No. L-21189, November 28, 1964, Paredes, J.**

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Luzviminda Paruñgao San Pedro filed a collection suit against petitioners Jose and Marta Avendaño (husband and wife) in the Municipal Court of Manila. The court ordered them to pay P2,000.00 plus interest and damages. On appeal to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, presided by respondent Judge Alikpala, the petitioners were declared in default. The CFI rendered judgment holding only Marta Avendaño liable [1], as she signed the promissory notes alone without her husband's consent [1].

Subsequently, a Writ of Garnishment was issued against Marta's salary from the Manila Railroad Company [2, 3]. Marta’s gross salary was P200.00 a month, with a take-home pay of only P151.50 [4]. Petitioners challenged the garnishment, arguing that her salary was insufficient for her and her family's expenses, as her share for family maintenance was P220.00 [5]. Judge Alikpala denied their petition to declare the garnishment invalid [6]. Petitioners filed a petition for Certiorari and Mandamus with Preliminary Injunction before the Supreme Court [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the salary of petitioner Marta Avendaño is exempt from garnishment.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Writ of Garnishment is illegal and void. Under **Section 12, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court**, "so much of the earnings of the debtor for his personal services within the month preceding the levy as are necessary for the support of his family" are exempt from execution [4].

The Court found that Marta Avendaño's take-home pay of P151.50 was much less than the P220.00 she needed to contribute for her family's maintenance [5]. Since the salary is insufficient for the support of her family, it is exempt from execution and cannot be reached by garnishment [5]. The Court also cited *Garcia v. Castillo*, holding that salary is subject to attachment only if not necessary for family support [5], and *Director of Commerce and Industry v. Concepcion*, noting that public policy generally forbids the garnishment of government employees' salaries [7].

The Writ of Garnishment is declared **NULL AND VOID**, and the Writ of Preliminary Injunction is made **PERMANENT** [8].
