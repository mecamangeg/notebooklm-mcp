I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. ANDRES ONG KHAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-19709, September 30, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Andres Ong Khan, born in Los Baños, Laguna in 1932, filed a petition for naturalization [1]. He completed his education in the Philippines and obtained a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of the East [1]. The Court of First Instance of Laguna granted his petition [2]. The Republic appealed, arguing that the petitioner failed to prove he could speak and write English and Tagalog, and that he used an alias in violation of Commonwealth Act No. 142 (Anti-Alias Law) [3].

While the Supreme Court found his college degree and occupation as a salesman sufficient proof of his language proficiency [3], the records revealed discrepancies in his name. His father’s name was Khaw Si, implying the proper surname should be "Khaw" [4]. However, the petition was filed under "Andres Ong Khan." His Alien Certificate of Registration and Immigration Certificate of Residence named him "Andres Khaw" [5]. Residence certificates from 1958 listed him as "Andres Khan" [5]. Various clearances presented in evidence used these names interchangeably [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for naturalization should be denied due to the petitioner's unauthorized use of aliases.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that the petitioner's use of different names ("Ong Khan", "Khaw", "Khan") created confusion regarding his identity, which is a violation of the law sufficient to deny Philippine citizenship [4, 6].

The Court emphasized that because naturalization proceedings are *in rem*, strict compliance with publication requirements is essential [7]. By using a name in his petition ("Ong Khan") different from the one in his official documents ("Khaw" or "Khan"), the petitioner was not fully identified in the published notices, effectively preventing the public from bringing objections to the trial court [5]. The records failed to show that the petitioner was authorized to use any alias [5]. Citing *Tan v. Republic*, the Court reiterated that even a difference of one letter in a name is a substantial defect that fails to correctly identify the party to the proceedings [7].

The decision appealed from granting the petition for naturalization is **REVERSED** [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., and Zaldivar concurred with the ruling [8].
