I. CAPTION
MERCEDES CLEMENTE, ET AL. v. JOVITO BONIFACIO (and VALLE BROS., INC., ET AL. v. JOVITO BONIFACIO), G.R. Nos. L-14888 & L-15151, September 30, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Jovito Bonifacio applied for a certificate of public convenience to operate TPU buses from Pasig to Plaza Sta. Cruz (Manila) via Highway 54 and Makati. Petitioners, existing operators on the Pasig-Manila line (via Mandaluyong/Sta. Mesa) and Makati-Manila line, opposed the application [1-3]. They argued that their services were adequate, that the new line would cause ruinous competition, and that the application violated a Public Service Commission (PSC) Memorandum Order prohibiting new applications for service within a 15-kilometer radius of Manila [2, 4].

The PSC granted Bonifacio authority to operate eight units, finding that the proposed route served a distinct public need by providing a direct link for Pasig residents to southern Manila (Paco, Herran, General Luna) without passing through the congested Sta. Mesa/Quiapo route [5, 6]. The PSC also ruled that the 15-kilometer ban did not apply because the route length was reasonable and the order was merely directory [7, 8]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N public necessity and convenience warrant the approval of the new line despite the opposition of old operators.
2. W/N the application is barred by the PSC Memorandum Order prohibiting new services within a 15-kilometer radius of Manila.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the findings of the PSC that the proposed service is beneficial and convenient to the public. The evidence showed that the new route provides a shorter, more direct travel time for Pasig residents working or studying in southern Manila, saving them from the delay and transfers required by the petitioners' circuitous route via Mandaluyong and Sta. Mesa [9, 10]. The Court held that the fact that a new line might partially affect the lines of old operators is "of no moment" where no operator is currently rendering a similar service on the new line [11]. In a network of competing operators, lines inevitably converge; the determination of valid duplication is within the PSC's jurisdiction (*Pasay Trans. Co. v. Manila Electric Co.*) [11].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the PSC should not "tie its hands" with the Memorandum Order. The order was merely "directory and temporary in nature and not mandatory," intended only to facilitate studies on existing services [12]. "Above all legal niceties, is the paramount public interest, necessity and convenience" (*Cebu Ice Plant v. Velez*) [12]. Furthermore, certifications from the Bureau of Public Highways indicated the route distance was likely over 15 kilometers (approx. 18-19 km), rendering the prohibition inapplicable [13].

Decision affirmed [14].
