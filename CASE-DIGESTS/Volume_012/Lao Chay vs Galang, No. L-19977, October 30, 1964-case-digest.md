I. CAPTION
LAO CHAY and NG SIU LUAN v. HON. EMILIO L. GALANG, G.R. No. L-19977, October 30, 1964, Regala, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Ng Siu Luan and her three minor children arrived in the Philippines on January 19, 1960, as temporary visitors authorized to stay until January 26, 1961 [2]. Her husband, Lao Chay, was admitted to Philippine citizenship on December 12, 1960 [2]. Following this, the spouses requested the Bureau of Immigration to cancel their alien certificates of registration [2]. The Commissioner of Immigration granted the request for Lao Chay and the children but denied it for Ng Siu Luan [3]. The Commissioner ruled that under Section 15 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, she did not automatically acquire her husband's citizenship because she lacked the necessary requirements, and subsequently ordered her to leave the country [3]. Petitioners filed for mandamus and prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, which granted the petition, holding that an alien wife need not possess the same qualifications as a naturalization applicant, provided she is not disqualified [4]. The Commissioner appealed [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the alien wife of a naturalized Filipino citizen automatically acquires Philippine citizenship if she does not possess the qualifications for naturalization [6].

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision [7]. The Court ruled that under Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization Law (C.A. No. 473), an alien woman married to a Filipino citizen acquires citizenship only if she "might herself be lawfully naturalized" [5]. Interpreting this provision, the Court held that the wife must possess all the qualifications prescribed in Section 2 and none of the disqualifications provided in Section 4 of the law [5]. Since Ng Siu Luan admitted she did not possess the qualifications for naturalization, she did not automatically acquire Filipino citizenship [5]. The Court also rejected the argument regarding family solidarity, stating it is irrelevant to the State's sovereign right to determine the admission and stay of aliens [8].

Decision reversed and writ of preliminary injunction dissolved [7].
