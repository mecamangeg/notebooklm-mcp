I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF SY CHU TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, SY CHHUT v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-17960, September 30, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Sy Chhut filed a petition for naturalization (Case No. 39194). Previously, he had filed a petition (Case No. 24659) which was denied by the Court of First Instance and affirmed by the Supreme Court on January 8, 1958. The rejection was based on his failure to establish irreproachable conduct, specifically for making false statements in his declaration of intention regarding a prior conviction for violating a municipal ordinance (constructing a building without a permit), and for failing to prove that his children’s schools met statutory requirements [1-3].

On February 5, 1959, Sy Chhut filed the current petition, alleging he had corrected the previous defects [4]. The trial court denied the petition, ruling that the previous finding of lack of irreproachable conduct reflected against his moral character and was not sufficiently overcome by mere testimony [5]. Sy Chhut appealed, arguing that the defects were cured and his witnesses attested to his good reputation [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner has sufficiently proved his reformation and good moral character to warrant naturalization despite the previous denial of his application.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that while a finding of lack of irreproachable conduct in a previous case does not constitute a permanent bar to naturalization, the applicant must prove that he has observed irreproachable conduct for a "reasonable period of years" after the denial [7].

In this case, the evidence was insufficient to provide the State a reasonable guaranty that the petitioner had reformed. The Court noted that the previous final decision was promulgated on January 8, 1958, and the second application was filed on February 5, 1959. The Court held that this period—characterized as "a little less than one year"—was too short to demonstrate that the petitioner had become a man of good moral character subsequent to the first denial [8].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [9].
