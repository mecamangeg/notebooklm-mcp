I. CAPTION
ITOGON-SUYOC MINES, INC. v. JOSE BALDO, SAÑGILO-ITOGON WORKERS UNION, and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-17739, December 24, 1964, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Jose Baldo, a miner for Itogon-Suyoc Mines since 1954, was given a 30-day notice of termination on February 4, 1958, effective March 5, 1958, allegedly for inefficiency and violation of safety rules [1, 2]. At the time, Baldo had joined the Sañgilo-Itogon Workers Union, a rival to the Itogon Labor Union which had a collective bargaining agreement with the company [3]. While Baldo's plea for reinstatement was pending before the Grievance Committee (composed of management and the rival union), company supervisor Mansueto Gelladoga asked Baldo not to testify in a pending certification election case in exchange for his reinstatement [3]. Baldo refused and testified adversely to the company on April 7, 1958 [3, 4]. Immediately thereafter, the Grievance Committee dropped his case, and he was never reinstated [4, 5].

The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found the company guilty of Unfair Labor Practice (ULP), ruling that the dismissal was unjust and illegal [6]. The CIR ordered Baldo's reinstatement with backwages from the date he was promised reinstatement [6]. The company appealed, arguing it was the rival union that dropped the grievance case and that the award of backwages was an abuse of discretion [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the company committed Unfair Labor Practice in dismissing Baldo and failing to reinstate him.
2. W/N the CIR abused its discretion in awarding backwages.

IV. RULING
**1. YES.** The Court affirmed that the petitioner committed unfair labor practices under Section 4(a), subparagraphs 1, 4, and 5 of Republic Act No. 875 [8]. The evidence established that management participated in dropping Baldo's grievance case [5]. The company's General Superintendent acted as an adviser to the rival union, and a supervisor explicitly attempted to coerce Baldo into not testifying in the certification election [3, 5]. The timing of the Grievance Committee dropping the case immediately after Baldo's adverse testimony, combined with the finding that his alleged offenses did not warrant dismissal, proved the ULP charge [4, 5].

**2. NO.** The Court ruled that when an employer commits unfair labor practices, it must shoulder all consequences of its unfair acts [8]. Under Section 5(c) of Republic Act No. 875, the granting of backwages to a reinstated employee is discretionary with the Court of Industrial Relations [8]. Citing *United Employees Welfare Ass’n. vs. Isaac Peral Bowling Alleys* and *Union of Philippine Education Co. Employees vs. Philippine Education Co.*, the Court found no abuse of discretion in awarding backwages from the date reinstatement was promised (April 7, 1958) until actual reinstatement [9].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
