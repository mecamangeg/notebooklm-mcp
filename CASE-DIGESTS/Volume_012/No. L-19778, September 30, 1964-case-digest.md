I. CAPTION
CROMWELL COMMERCIAL EMPLOYEES AND LABORERS UNION (PTUC) v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and CROMWELL COMMERCIAL CO., INC., G.R. No. L-19778, September 30, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Cromwell Commercial Co. and the Petitioner Union had a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The Company violated the CBA by failing to grant salary increases and unilaterally reducing the salaries and allowances of salesmen. It also dismissed union leaders Francisco Gaddi and Cresenciano Andrada, and effectively locked out five salesmen by ordering them to garage their trucks. Consequently, the Union declared a strike on March 11, 1957.

The Company gave strikers a deadline to return to work, but the strikers offered to return only if the Company observed the CBA provisions. The Company insisted they return under the reduced salary terms. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found the Company guilty of unfair labor practice (ULP). The CIR ordered the reinstatement of Gaddi, Andrada, and the five salesmen with half backwages. It also ordered the reinstatement of the voluntary strikers but *without* backwages. However, the CIR denied reinstatement to Andrada and Angel Dario due to acts of violence and to those who found substantial employment elsewhere. The Union appealed the denial of backwages for the strikers and the denial of reinstatement for certain employees.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N employees guilty of unlawful conduct or violence during a strike are entitled to reinstatement.
2. W/N employees who found substantially equivalent employment elsewhere are automatically barred from reinstatement.
3. W/N the voluntary strikers are entitled to backwages.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** While employees striking due to ULP are generally entitled to reinstatement, an exception exists for those guilty of unlawful conduct or violence. The CIR found Andrada and Dario guilty of hurling stones and uttering obscenities. The Court held that the CIR has the discretion to determine the effect of such misconduct and deny reinstatement to effectuate the policies of the Industrial Peace Act.

2. **NO.** Citing *Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB*, the Court ruled that finding equivalent employment is not a legal bar to reinstatement. However, the CIR retains the administrative discretion to determine if reinstatement is appropriate in such cases. The CIR did not abuse its discretion in denying reinstatement to those who found substantial employment elsewhere to effectuate the Act's policy.

3. **NO.** A distinction must be made between employees discriminatorily dismissed (who are entitled to backpay from the date of discharge) and those who voluntarily strike in protest of ULP. Voluntary strikers are not entitled to backpay because their work stoppage is not a direct consequence of the employer's acts, and their economic loss should not be shifted to the employer. While backpay may be awarded if strikers make an *unconditional* offer to return and are refused, the Union's offer here was conditional (predicated on CBA observance). Thus, the denial of backwages to the voluntary strikers was proper.

The decision and resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations are AFFIRMED.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**J.B.L. Reyes, J., Dissenting:**
Justice Reyes disagreed with denying backpay to the reinstated laborers. He argued that the employer was the first to infringe the CBA and provoked the strike. Denying backpay places the economic loss on the victims of ULP and encourages employer misconduct.
