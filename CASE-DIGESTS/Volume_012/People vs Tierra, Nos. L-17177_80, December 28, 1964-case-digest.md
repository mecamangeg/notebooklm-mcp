I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ILDEFONSO TIERRA, G.R. Nos. L-17177–80, December 28, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Ildefonso Tierra was engaged in the general merchandise business and filed his income tax returns for the years 1946, 1947, and 1949 [1]. Following an investigation where Tierra failed to produce pertinent books and records, an examiner discovered he had filed false and fraudulent returns by overstating purchases and expenses [1, 2]. On December 23, 1950, the Collector of Internal Revenue demanded payment for deficiency taxes, but Tierra refused to pay [3, 4]. Consequently, on December 12, 1955, four informations were filed against him for filing false returns and failing to preserve books of accounts [5, 6]. The Court of First Instance of Manila found Tierra guilty, sentencing him to fines, imprisonment, and ordering him to indemnify the Republic for the deficiency taxes [7]. Tierra appealed, arguing among others that the informations were defective and the action had prescribed [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the informations were void for failing to allege the accused's age, residence, or citizenship.
2. W/N the criminal action has prescribed.
3. W/N the extinguishment of civil liability to pay taxes extinguishes criminal liability.
4. W/N civil indemnity for unpaid taxes may be imposed in a criminal prosecution for violation of the Tax Code.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The informations were valid. It was not necessary to allege age, residence, or citizenship because Tierra had submitted his income tax returns, which implied he was bound to make them [10].

2. **NO.** The action had not prescribed. Under Section 354 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), prescription begins to run from the discovery of the violation if not known at the time of commission [11]. The falsity of returns and failure to preserve books were discovered only on December 16, 1950, and the informations were filed on December 12, 1955; thus, the filing was within the five-year prescriptive period [11].

3. **NO.** Criminal liability is not extinguished by the satisfaction or prescription of civil liability. The duty to pay tax is imposed by statute, and Section 73 of the NIRC penalizes the act of filing false returns independent of the tax collection. The failure of the government to enforce civil remedies does not detract from its right to criminally prosecute violations of the Code [12].

4. **NO.** There is no legal sanction for the imposition of civil indemnity for unpaid taxes in a criminal proceeding [13]. Citing *People v. Arnault*, the Court held that Chapters I and II of Title IX of the NIRC provide for civil remedies (distraint or judicial action) which are generally exclusive [14].

**ACCORDINGLY**, the decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the portions regarding payment of monetary indemnity to the Government are eliminated [15].
