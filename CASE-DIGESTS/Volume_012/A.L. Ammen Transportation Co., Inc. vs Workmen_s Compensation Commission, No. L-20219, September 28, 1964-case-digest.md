I. CAPTION
A.L. AMMEN TRANSPORTATION CO., INC. v. THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20219, September 28, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Agripino Jacob was employed as a line inspector for petitioner A.L. Ammen Transportation Co., Inc. On October 11, 1960, while on a duly approved leave of absence, he attended a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Bicol Transportation Employees Mutual Aid Association (BITEMAA), an organization independent of the company. During the meeting, he was attacked by a co-employee with a bolo, resulting in his death the following day.

On April 4, 1961, his widow filed a claim for compensation. The hearing officer dismissed the complaint, finding the death did not arise out of employment. However, the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed this decision, ruling that the death was compensable because Jacob was working for the benefit of employees and promoting good relations with management. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the death of the employee arose out of or in the course of his employment.
2. W/N the claim for compensation is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that for a death to be compensable, three requirements must concur: (1) the injury must be received during the period covered by the employment; (2) the worker must be shown to have been injured at the time and place where the performance of his work requires him to be; and (3) the worker must have been doing something in pursuance of his work. In this case, Jacob was on leave of absence and was not performing his usual duties as a line inspector, nor was he in a place where his work required him to be. He was presiding over a meeting of an association entirely independent of the company. Consequently, the presumption of compensability does not apply.

2. **YES.** The claim was filed nearly five months after the death of the employee, violating Section 24 of Act 3428 (Workmen’s Compensation Act), which requires claims to be filed within three months after death. This prescription was not offset by any proof that the employer voluntarily gave compensation to the heirs.

The decision appealed from is REVERSED.
