I. CAPTION
GO UAN, ONG ANA and ONG BUN JUA v. EMILIO L. GALANG, in his capacity as Commissioner of Immigration, G.R. No. L-20413, December 23, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were former permanent residents who returned to the Philippines in 1948 as temporary visitors. After overstaying, the Supreme Court in 1954 (G.R. No. L-6017) upheld their deportation but ruled they could depart voluntarily and procure proper visas from a consul. Petitioners did not leave until February 20, 1960—over five years later. They returned in March 1960 with visas. Subsequently, deportation charges were filed against them under Section 29(a)(15) of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, which excludes aliens who have been previously deported. The Board of Special Inquiry (BSI) recommended that the Commissioner waive this provision and admit the petitioners. Commissioner Galang refused to waive the exclusion and ordered their deportation. Petitioners filed a prohibition case in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, which ruled that the Commissioner gravely abused his discretion by ignoring the BSI recommendation. The Commissioner appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Commissioner of Immigration gravely abused his discretion in refusing to waive the exclusion of the petitioners despite the BSI's recommendation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that a recommendation of the Board of Special Inquiry is not binding upon the Commissioner of Immigration [1, 2]. Discretion is defined as a faculty conferred upon an official by which he may decide a question either way and still be right [2]. The Commissioner did not abuse his discretion in refusing to waive Section 29(a)(15) because the petitioners demonstrated a high degree of contumacy and little respect for lawful orders by remaining in the Philippines for over five years after the 1954 Supreme Court decision ordered their deportation [2].

Decision appealed is reversed and the writ of preliminary injunction is dissolved [3].
