I. CAPTION
TOMAS BESA v. JOSE CASTELLVI, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18421, September 28, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tomas Besa filed a petition in the testate estate of Alfonso de Castellvi to fix attorney's fees for services rendered to oppositors Jose and Consuelo Castellvi regarding the estate and other civil cases [1]. The Court of First Instance of Pampanga initially ordered oppositors to pay P20,000.00, but upon reconsideration, amended the order to award Besa one-third of whatever share the oppositors may receive from the decedent's estate [2]. The oppositors appealed this amended order to the Supreme Court [2].

Pending this appeal, the Supreme Court rendered a decision in a related case (G.R. No. L-17630) affirming that the oppositors had no right to share in the estate of Alfonso de Castellvi, as the true heirs were determined to be Natividad de Castellvi de Raquiza and the heirs of Juan de Castellvi [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal regarding attorney's fees has been rendered moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the appeal is now purposeless or nugatory. The order appealed from specifically designated the attorney's fees as "one-third of whatever share oppositors may get from the estate of their deceased father" [2]. Since the Court, in G.R. No. L-17630, definitively ruled that the oppositors are not entitled to any share in the said estate, the basis for the computation of the attorney's fees has ceased to exist, rendering the order moot [4].

Appeal dismissed [4].
