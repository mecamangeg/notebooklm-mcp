I. CAPTION
MARCELINO M. FRANCISCO and CLARA C. FRANCISCO v. THE CITY OF DAVAO, TELESFORO ALFELOR, City Assessor of Davao, and SIMPLICIO MONTANO, City Treasurer of Davao, G.R. No. L-20654, December 24, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In 1950, plaintiff Clara C. Francisco was awarded Lot No. 129-A of the Santa Ana Reservation by the Bureau of Lands at a purchase price of P2.50 per square meter, payable in installments [1]. In 1955, while the title still remained with the State, the City Assessor of Davao assessed the property for real estate tax purposes at P8.28 per square meter [1]. Francisco protested, arguing that under Section 115 of Commonwealth Act (C.A.) No. 141 (Public Land Act), the assessment should be based on the value fixed in the contract (P2.50) [1]. The City Treasurer demanded payment based on the higher assessment, which Francisco paid under protest before filing a suit for refund [1]. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered a refund, reasoning that under the Davao City Charter (C.A. No. 51), the City could not tax property not privately owned [2, 3]. The defendants appealed [4].

III. ISSUES
1. W/N the City of Davao can tax public lands granted to private persons even while title remains with the State.
2. W/N the assessment of the property should be based on its market value or the value fixed in the contract.
3. W/N the case should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA).

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Section 115 of C.A. No. 141, public lands granted by the State are subject to ordinary taxes beginning the year next following the signing of the contract, "even though and while the title remains in the State" [5]. While Section 26 of the Davao City Charter (C.A. No. 51) generally exempts government-owned lands from taxation, it must yield to Section 115 of C.A. No. 141, which is a subsequent legislation that modifies the Charter and reflects the general policy of the Government regarding public lands [6].

2. **NO.** The assessment must be based on the contract price. Section 115 of C.A. No. 141 is explicit that such lands shall be taxed "on the basis of the value fixed in such approval, concession or contract" [5, 7]. Since the value fixed in the contract was P2.50 per square meter, the assessment at P8.28 per square meter was illegal [7].

3. **NO.** Although the case should have been coursed through the CTA pursuant to R.A. No. 1125, the Court held that the ends of justice would not be served by dismissing the case nine years after its initiation only to have the plaintiffs start over [8, 9]. Since the assessment was manifestly violative of the clear provisions of the law, the Supreme Court resolved the question directly [9].

The decision appealed from is REVERSED, and another one entered directing the defendants to refund to the plaintiffs the amount collected in excess of the tax based on the purchase price of the property [10].
