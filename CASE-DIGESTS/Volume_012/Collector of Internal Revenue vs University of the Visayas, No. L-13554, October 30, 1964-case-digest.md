I. CAPTION
COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. UNIVERSITY OF THE VISAYAS, G.R. No. L-13554, October 30, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
This resolves a Motion for Reconsideration filed by the Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) against a Supreme Court decision which affirmed the Court of Tax Appeals. The previous ruling held the University of the Visayas exempt from income tax under Section 27(e) of the National Internal Revenue Code.

The University is an educational corporation under the absolute control of its President and his immediate family, who own 85% of the capital stock. From 1946 to 1950, the University realized a net income of P302,479.02. Except for P28,000 set aside for operational expenses, the net income was invested in real properties (permanent assets) registered in the personal names of the President and his wife. The President admitted that he considered himself and the University as one. He also blocked a proposal by the Board to issue additional shares on accumulated profits, preferring to leave the assets undistributed. The CIR argues the net income inured to the benefit of the President, disqualifying the University from tax exemption.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the University of the Visayas is exempt from income tax under Section 27(e) of the National Internal Revenue Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court granted the Motion for Reconsideration and set aside its original decision. Section 27(e) of the Tax Code, as amended by R.A. No. 82, exempts educational institutions only if "no part of the net income of which inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual."

The Court found that the University was a mere *alter ego* or business conduit of its President; thus, the corporate fiction was disregarded (*Koppel [Phil.] Inc. v. Yatco*). The net income invested in properties registered in the President's name clearly inured to his benefit. By failing to declare dividends, the accumulated funds and assets remained with the President, allowing him to benefit from 100% of the income while evading taxes. Consequently, the University failed to meet the statutory requirement for exemption.

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **REVERSED**. The University is declared liable for income tax and is **ORDERED** to pay P37,212.06 for the years 1946 to 1950, plus interest and penalties.
