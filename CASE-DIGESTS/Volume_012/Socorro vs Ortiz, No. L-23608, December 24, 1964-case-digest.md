I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO SOCORRO v. HON. MONTANO ORTIZ, ZACARIAS C. AQUINO, DIRECTOR OF FORESTRY and COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-23608, December 24, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Socorro and respondent Aquino were competing bidders for a forest tract in Agusan. After a series of administrative appeals reaching the Office of the President, the award was given to Socorro. Aquino challenged this in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan, which ruled in his favor and issued an injunction against Socorro. Socorro appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals (CA) and filed a separate certiorari petition regarding the injunction [1-3].

While these cases were pending, Socorro and Aquino entered into a Compromise Agreement on January 16, 1962, agreeing to divide the disputed 2,600-hectare area equally (1,300 hectares each). The Supreme Court approved this compromise in G.R. No. L-18254 [4, 5]. However, the CA subsequently denied a motion for reconsideration in the main appeal, effectively insisting Socorro be awarded the entire area. Socorro then filed a motion with the CFI to execute the CA decision awarding him the whole tract. The CFI denied the motion, ruling that the Supreme Court's approval of the compromise agreement prevailed over the CA decision. Socorro filed a petition for certiorari with the CA questioning this denial, which the CA dismissed. Socorro then appealed to the Supreme Court [5-7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the execution of the Court of Appeals decision.
2. W/N certiorari was the proper remedy to question the lower court's denial of the motion for execution.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the lower court was correct in refusing to order the execution of the Court of Appeals decision. The parties had entered into a compromise agreement, approved by the Supreme Court, which clearly defined their rights to share the contested forest area in equal parts. Executing the CA decision, which awarded the entire area to one party, would run counter to the Supreme Court's resolution approving the compromise [7].

2. **NO.** The Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' dismissal of Socorro's petition on procedural grounds. The proper remedy against the lower court's denial of a motion for execution is an appeal, not a petition for certiorari [8].

Petition dismissed.
