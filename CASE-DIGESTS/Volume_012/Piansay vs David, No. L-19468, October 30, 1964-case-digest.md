I. CAPTION
SALVADOR PIANSAY and CLAUDIA V. VDA. DE UY KIM v. CONRADO S. DAVID and MARCOS MANGUBAT, G.R. No. L-19468, October 30, 1964, 12 SCRA 227, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Conrado S. David executed a chattel mortgage over his house in favor of Claudia V. Vda. de Uy Kim. Mrs. Uy Kim foreclosed on the mortgage, purchased the house at the auction, and subsequently sold it to Salvador Piansay [1].

In a prior proceeding (Civil Case No. 29078), Marcos Mangubat, a judgment creditor of David, levied upon the house. Piansay objected, claiming ownership [1, 2]. However, the Court of First Instance and subsequently the Court of Appeals (in CA-G.R. No. 21797-R) ruled that the chattel mortgage was void because the house is real property. Consequently, Mrs. Uy Kim acquired no right to the house and could not validly transfer it to Piansay, leaving the property subject to execution for David's debts [3, 4].

Despite this final ruling, Piansay and Mrs. Uy Kim filed the present action (Civil Case No. 47664) against David and Mangubat to restrain the levy and declare Piansay the owner [1]. The lower court dismissed the complaint on the ground of *res judicata* [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the plaintiffs’ action is barred by the principle of *res judicata*.
2. W/N a chattel mortgage constituted on a house binds third persons who are not parties to the contract.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The validity of the chattel mortgage and sale in favor of Mrs. Uy Kim had already been annulled in the decision in Civil Case No. 29078, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals [2]. Piansay previously assailed Mangubat's right to levy on the house, and the court rejected his claim, ruling that the mortgage was ineffective. This order became final and executory after the denial of Piansay’s petition for certiorari and mandamus [2]. Thus, the plaintiffs are barred from asserting the validity of the chattel mortgage and sale in this new action [2].

2. **NO.** Regardless of the validity of the contract as between the parties, a chattel mortgage on a house (which is real property) cannot bind third persons who are not parties to the contract or their privies [6]. Citing *Leung Yee v. Strong Machinery Co.* and *Navarro v. Pineda*, the Court held that the contract produced no effect against Mangubat [6]. As the extrajudicial foreclosure was null and void regarding Mangubat, Mrs. Uy Kim acquired no dominical right to the house and could not transmit any right to Piansay [6].

The orders appealed from are affirmed [7].
