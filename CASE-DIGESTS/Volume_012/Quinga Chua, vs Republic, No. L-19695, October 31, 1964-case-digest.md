I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF MATEO QUINGA CHUA TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, MATEO QUINGA CHUA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19695, October 31, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Mateo Quinga Chua filed for naturalization, testifying that he was employed as a bookkeeper at China Bazar in Tacloban City with an annual salary of P2,400.00 plus board and lodging allowances [1]. The Court of First Instance of Leyte granted the petition, finding that he possessed all the necessary qualifications [2, 3]. The Solicitor General appealed the decision, arguing that the petitioner failed to prove that the petition and notice of hearing were posted in the Clerk of Court's office as required by the Revised Naturalization Law, and that he failed to prove he had a lucrative trade or income [4]. Petitioner admitted no evidence was presented regarding the posting but contended that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty should apply [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to adduce positive proof of the posting of the petition and notice of hearing warrants the dismissal of the petition.
2. W/N the petitioner's annual income of P2,400.00 satisfies the requirement of a lucrative trade or profession.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the presumption that official duty has been duly performed does not suffice where the law specifically requires positive proof of a fact, particularly when it constitutes a jurisdictional matter like the posting of notice in naturalization proceedings [5, 6]. Citing *Co v. Republic*, the Court emphasized that non-compliance with publication requirements constitutes a fatal defect that impairs the very root of the court's authority to decide the case [5, 7].

2. **NO.** The Court held that a net annual income of P2,400.00, even if true, does not satisfy the requirement of a lucrative trade, income, or profession, considering the high cost of living [7, 8]. Furthermore, the petitioner's failure to report this income in his tax returns suggested either that he did not actually earn said amount or that he committed fraud, either of which disqualifies him from naturalization [7].

The decision appealed from is reversed and the petition for naturalization is dismissed [9].
