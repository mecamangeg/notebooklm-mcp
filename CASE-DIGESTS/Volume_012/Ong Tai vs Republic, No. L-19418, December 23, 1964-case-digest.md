I. CAPTION
ONG TAI v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19418, December 23, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Ong Tai, a Chinese citizen born in 1931, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila on December 27, 1960 [1], [2], [3]. In his petition, he stated his present residence at 634 Carvajal St., Manila, and one former residence at 1131 Sta. Elena St., Manila, but failed to mention all his former places of residence [3], [4]. Regarding his financial capacity, Ong Tai was employed at Seng Hap Guan Grocery with an average yearly income of P4,125.00 (ranging from P3,200 in 1957 to P6,100 in 1960) to support himself, his wife, and three children [3], [4]. The CFI granted his petition, and the Republic appealed [1], [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to state all former places of residence in the petition is fatal.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The failure of an applicant to mention a former place of residence in his petition is fatal as it involves a violation of Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law [5], [6]. The Court held that such omission falsifies the truth, indicating a lack of good moral character, which disqualifies the applicant from admission to Philippine citizenship [5], [6]. The argument that the omission was immaterial because the omitted residence was near the reported one was rejected, as non-compliance impairs the effectivity of the official investigation [7], [4].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that an average yearly income of P4,125.00 cannot be deemed lucrative for an applicant with a family composed of a wife and three children, considering the high cost of living and low purchasing power of the peso [8], [9], [4]. The Court emphasized that the petitioner's financial capacity should be determined as of the time of the filing of the petition [8], [9]. Attempting to prove increased income during the appeal (via commissions) is of no moment because such earnings are speculative and occurred after the petition was filed [9], [4].

The decision appealed from is reversed [10].
