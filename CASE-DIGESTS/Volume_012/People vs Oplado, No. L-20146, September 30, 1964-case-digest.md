I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. VIRGILIO OPLADO and VISITACION FERNANDEZ GUYOT, G.R. No. L-20146, September 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On November 26, 1958, the husband of Visitacion Fernandez Guyot filed a complaint for adultery against her and Virgilio Oplado in the Municipal Court of Cebu City [1]. An amended information was subsequently filed in the Court of First Instance of Cebu [2]. The prosecution failed to arrest Visitacion, causing repeated postponements, although the prosecution was always ready to proceed against Oplado [2]. On March 5, 1962, with Visitacion still at large, Oplado moved for the provisional dismissal of the case [2]. Over the prosecution's objection, the lower court granted the dismissal, citing Oplado's right to a speedy trial [3]. The City Fiscal appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an accused in an adultery case may be validly tried separately in the absence of the co-accused.

IV. RULING
**YES.** While the law (Art. 344, Revised Penal Code) requires that the offended spouse institute prosecution against both guilty parties if living, the statute does not require that they be tried together [4]. It is settled that a defendant in an adultery case may be tried alone or separately from his co-defendant if the prosecution and the available party are ready [5].

The Supreme Court ruled that the provisional dismissal by the lower court was an error and an abuse of discretion [6]. The right to a speedy trial demanded that the case against Oplado be heard and prosecuted to a conclusion without waiting for the arrest of his co-accused, rather than dismissed [6]. The Court cited *U.S. vs. Gallegos* and *U.S. vs. Topiño* to establish that the acquittal or absence of one accused does not necessarily bar the prosecution or conviction of the other [7, 8].

The order appealed from is set aside, and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [9].
