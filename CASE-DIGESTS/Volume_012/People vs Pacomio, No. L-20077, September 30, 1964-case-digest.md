I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROMEO PACOMIO, ET AL. and ASSOCIATED INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-20077, September 30, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Romeo and Justiniano Pacomio were accused of illegal possession of dynamite and released on bail bonds of P1,200.00 each posted by appellant Associated Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. [1]. The accused failed to appear at the hearing on February 26, 1959, despite notice to the surety [1]. Consequently, the trial court ordered the surety to produce the accused within thirty (30) days and show cause why judgment should not be rendered against the bonds [1]. Although the surety received this notice on March 7, 1959, it failed to comply within the period [1]. On July 31, 1959, the court rendered judgment against the surety for the full amount of P2,400.00 [1].

On September 23, 1959, the surety finally surrendered the accused and moved to set aside the confiscation, claiming the accused were at sea fishing and unaware of the hearing [1, 2]. The lower court amended its order on November 25, 1959, reducing the surety's liability to P1,800.00 rather than exonerating it completely [1]. The surety appealed, seeking total exoneration [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the surety is entitled to total exoneration from liability on the bail bonds upon the subsequent surrender of the accused.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the surety was not entitled to total exoneration because it was "grossly remiss in the performance of its duty" [3]. The record showed that the surety: (1) failed to notify the accused of the scheduled hearing; (2) sent no representative to explain their absence on the hearing date; and (3) did nothing to comply with the 30-day order to produce the body and show cause, despite receiving notice [3].

The Court ruled that the mere reduction of the judgment amount from P2,400.00 to P1,800.00 was fully justified given the surety's gross negligence, despite the later production of the accused [3, 4]. The explanation that the accused were fishing was unverified and not properly introduced as evidence [3].

Order affirmed [5].
