I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION and BOARD OF IMMIGRATION COMMISSIONERS v. HON. LUIS B. REYES as Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL, et al., G.R. No. L-23838, December 28, 1964, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
On October 10, 1964, respondents Tobianos filed a petition for certiorari (Civil Case No. 58624) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against petitioners, the Commissioner of Immigration and the Board of Immigration Commissioners, regarding their exclusion as aliens [1]. Subsequently, on October 26, 1964, a petition for habeas corpus (Civil Case No. 58782) was filed on behalf of Jose and Justo Tobiano. Upon an *ex parte* petition by the Tobianos, the Executive Judge (respondent Judge Reyes) assigned the habeas corpus case to Branch VI, presided by respondent Judge Cloribel, without holding a raffle [2].

Petitioners filed motions for reconsideration, arguing that the assignment to Branch VI without raffle and prior notice violated Section 7, Rule 22 of the Rules of Court. The Executive Judge set the motions for hearing, where parties were heard, but ultimately denied the motions on November 18, 1964 [3, 4]. The Judge justified the assignment based on an internal court policy to assign cases involving the same fundamental questions to the branch where the first case was assigned to avoid duplicity [5]. Petitioners filed the present petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus with the Supreme Court, alleging deprivation of their day in court [4, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the assignment of the cases to Branch VI without a raffle violated Section 7, Rule 22 of the Rules of Court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that Section 7 of Rule 22 does not require that the assignment of cases be done exclusively through a raffle. The rule explicitly states that assignment or transfer may be done "by raffle or otherwise" [6].

The Court further ruled that the requirement of notice under Section 7 is intended to afford parties a chance to be heard. This purpose was sufficiently accomplished when the petitioners filed motions for reconsideration and were fully heard on the question of the assignment before the order was affirmed [7].

Furthermore, the Court sustained the internal policy of the CFI of Manila to assign cases involving the "same fundamental questions" to the same branch, even if the parties are different, to facilitate consolidation. Under Section 167-A of the Revised Administrative Code and Section 61 of the Judiciary Act, the CFI of Manila has administrative control over its internal operations. As Civil Cases Nos. 58624 and 58782 involved questions similar to cases already pending before Branch VI, the assignment was proper and the Supreme Court found no justifiable reason to interfere [8].

The petition was denied, and the preliminary injunction dissolved [9, 10].
