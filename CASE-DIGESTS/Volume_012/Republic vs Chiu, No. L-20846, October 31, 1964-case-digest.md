I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DIONISIO CHIU and HON. MACAPANTON ABBAS, G.R. No. L-20846, October 31, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Dionisio Chiu filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Davao. The City Attorney of Davao was designated by the Solicitor General to appear at the trial and represent the government. On July 31, 1962, the trial court rendered a decision granting the petition. The City Attorney received a copy of the decision on July 31, 1962, while the Solicitor General received his copy on August 17, 1962. Upon instructions from the Solicitor General, the City Attorney filed the notice of appeal and record on appeal on September 4 and 6, 1962, respectively. Chiu opposed, arguing the appeal was filed beyond the 30-day reglementary period if computed from the City Attorney's receipt. The lower court sustained Chiu and dismissed the appeal for being late. The Republic filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus before the Supreme Court [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the period to perfect an appeal in naturalization cases should be counted from the receipt of the decision by the Solicitor General.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The period to appeal must be counted from the receipt of the decision by the Solicitor General, not the City Attorney. Under Section 10 of the Revised Naturalization Law, the Solicitor General appears on behalf of the Republic "either himself or through his delegate or the provincial fiscal concerned" [3]. The Court held that this provision merely allows for the physical substitution of the Solicitor General and does not divest him of control over the State's defense, nor does it make the City Attorney the counsel of record [4]. The City Attorney appears merely as a representative of the Solicitor General, who remains the counsel of record for the oppositor Republic [4]. Since the Solicitor General received the decision on August 17, 1962, the filings on September 4 and 6 were well within the period which would have expired on September 16, 1962. The lower court's order dismissing the appeal was set aside and it was directed to approve the record on appeal [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Dizon and Makalintal concurred in the result [6].
