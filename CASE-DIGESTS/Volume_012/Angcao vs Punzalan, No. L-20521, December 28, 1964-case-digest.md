I. CAPTION
ISAIAS ANGCAO, ET AL. v. JOSE PUNZALAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20521, December 28, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On March 14, 1957, Jose Punzalan filed a complaint for forcible entry against Isaias Angcao and others in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Samal, Bataan. Punzalan alleged he had actual occupancy of the land since 1933 under an approved Homestead Application until the defendants ousted him by force and stealth in 1956. Angcao argued the JP Court lacked jurisdiction, claiming the land was part of a communal forest and thus inalienable. The JP Court ruled in favor of Punzalan, finding the land was alienable based on Bureau of Lands testimony. Angcao did not appeal, and the judgment became final and executory.

Later, Angcao filed a petition for certiorari in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bataan to annul the JP judgment, which was dismissed. Angcao subsequently filed another action for injunction in the CFI, reiterating that the land was part of the Bataan National Park and the JP judgment was void. The CFI dismissed this case on the ground of bar by prior judgment. Angcao appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved purely legal issues.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Justice of the Peace Court had jurisdiction over the ejectment case despite the allegation that the land is inalienable public forest.
2. W/N the action is barred by prior judgment.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Justice of the Peace Courts have exclusive jurisdiction over ejectment cases where the issue is merely "prior possession." The Supreme Court held that the claim that the property is part of a communal forest does not negate the fact that the plaintiff had an approved Homestead Application and prior possession. Once entry or possession over public land is authorized by the Bureau of Lands, the entryman is entitled to look to the courts for the protection and maintenance of his peaceful possession against intruders (*Pitarque vs. Sorilla*).

2. **YES.** The issues of jurisdiction and possession were already resolved by the JP Court in a decision that had long become final and executory. This ruling became the law of the case. The subsequent proceedings were merely attempts to reopen settled issues, and thus the action is precluded by the doctrine of bar by prior judgment.

**Disposition:** Appeal dismissed. Decision affirmed with double costs against petitioners.
