I. CAPTION
ROMANA CAMPITA v. HON. AQUILINO L. VILLANUEVA and HOBART DATOR, G.R. No. L-20228, November 28, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Romana Campita was charged with oral defamation in Criminal Case No. 321 before the Municipal Court of Lucena City. The complaint was filed by a Constabulary Officer, not by the private offended party, respondent Hobart Dator [1, 2]. The complaint alleged that Campita called Dator "Walang hiya, bastos, masamang tao, manggagahasa ka" (Shameless, rude, bad man, you are a rapist) [3].

Campita moved to dismiss the case, arguing that under the fourth paragraph of Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), a criminal action for defamation imputing a crime which cannot be prosecuted *de oficio* (like rape) must be filed expressly by the offended party. The Municipal Judge denied the motion [4]. Campita then filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon. The CFI dismissed her petition, ruling that the requirement in Art. 360 applies only to written defamation (libel) and not oral defamation [2, 5]. Campita appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the requirement under Art. 360, par. 4 of the RPC that the complaint be filed by the offended party applies to oral defamation.
2. W/N the imputation of the term "manggagahasa" refers to a crime that cannot be prosecuted *de oficio*.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the provisions of Article 360 are part of Section Two, Chapter I, Title Thirteen of the RPC, entitled "General Provisions." While Chapter I is captioned "Libel," Section One includes provisions for "slander or oral defamation" (Art. 358). Therefore, the General Provisions in Articles 360, 361, and 362 apply to both libel and oral defamation [5]. Consequently, a complaint for oral defamation imputing a private crime must be filed by the offended party, not by a law enforcement officer [1].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the term "manggagahasa" (rapist), especially when preceded by "bastos" (rude/lewd), clearly imputes the commission of rape or acts of lasciviousness [3, 6]. "Gahasa" in this context refers to force or violence applied to a woman to satisfy lust. Since rape and acts of lasciviousness are private crimes that cannot be prosecuted *de oficio* except upon complaint by the offended party (Art. 344, RPC), the complaint filed by the Constabulary Officer did not confer jurisdiction upon the trial court [6].

The order appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the proceedings in Criminal Case No. 321 are annulled and permanently restrained [7].
