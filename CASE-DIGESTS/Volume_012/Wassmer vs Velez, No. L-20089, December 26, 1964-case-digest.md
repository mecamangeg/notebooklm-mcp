I. CAPTION
BEATRIZ P. WASSMER v. FRANCISCO X. VELEZ, G.R. No. L-20089, December 26, 1964, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Francisco Velez and Beatriz Wassmer agreed to marry on September 4, 1954 [1]. They applied for a marriage license, distributed invitations, and made extensive preparations, including purchasing the bridal trousseau, party dresses, and a matrimonial bed [2]. On September 2, two days before the wedding, Velez left a note for Wassmer stating he had to postpone the wedding due to his mother's opposition and left for Mindanao [3], [2]. Although he sent a telegram the next day promising to return, he never appeared nor was heard from again [3]. Wassmer sued for damages. Velez failed to answer and was declared in default [3]. The trial court ruled in favor of Wassmer, awarding actual, moral, and exemplary damages [3]. Velez appealed, arguing that a mere breach of promise to marry is not an actionable wrong [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N breach of promise to marry is an actionable wrong in this case.
2. W/N the award of moral and exemplary damages is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While a "mere breach of promise to marry" is not an actionable wrong, the Court held that the case at bar did not involve a *mere* breach [5]. To formally set a wedding, go through all necessary preparations and publicity, and then walk out when the matrimony is about to be solemnized is palpably and unjustifiably contrary to good customs [5]. Consequently, the defendant must be held answerable for damages in accordance with Article 21 of the New Civil Code, which penalizes acts contrary to morals, good customs, or public policy [2], [5].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that moral damages are recoverable in cases falling under Article 21 pursuant to Article 2219(10) of the Civil Code [6]. Furthermore, exemplary damages were correctly awarded under Article 2232 because the defendant acted in a wanton, reckless, and oppressive manner given the circumstances [6]. However, the Court found the lower court's award excessive and reduced the total moral and exemplary damages to P15,000 [6].

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the award for moral and exemplary damages is reduced to P15,000 [7].
