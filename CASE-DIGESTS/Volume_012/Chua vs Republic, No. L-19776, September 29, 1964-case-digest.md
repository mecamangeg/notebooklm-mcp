I. CAPTION
BENJAMIN CHUA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19776, September 29, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Benjamin Chua filed an application for naturalization. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental denied the petition on March 3, 1962, on the grounds that Chua failed to prove he had mingled socially with Filipinos, failed to show reciprocity of laws between his country and the Philippines, and failed to produce a certificate of arrival. Chua appealed, arguing that his contributions to the Red Cross, school funds, and police funds, as well as his SSS membership, proved his social mingling. He further claimed that he could not submit his certificate of arrival because pre-war records were lost during the Pacific War. At the time of the application, Chua earned P325.00 a month to support himself, his wife, and three children.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner satisfied the requirement of mingling socially with Filipinos.
2. W/N the failure to attach the certificate of arrival to the petition is fatal to the application.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that charitable contributions do not establish that an applicant has mingled socially with Filipinos, as such acts can be performed without significant social intercourse [1]. To satisfy the requirement, an applicant must deal with and receive Filipinos in his home and visit Filipino homes in a spirit of friendliness and equality, without discrimination [1]. The burden is on the applicant to prove concrete instances of social relations—with dates, places, and names—spanning the entire period of residence [2, 3]. Furthermore, the fact that the petitioner could only recall Rizal and Mabini as national heroes after 27 years of residence strongly supported the conclusion that he had not mingled with Filipinos nor desired to embrace their ideals [3].

2. **NO.** Under Section 7 of the Naturalization Law, it is mandatory for the applicant to attach a copy of the certificate of arrival to the petition; without it, residence is presumptively unlawful [4]. The mere averment that records were lost is insufficient compliance. If the certificate was indeed lost, the petitioner should have averred such loss and submitted secondary proof of the existence and contents of the lost certificate [5].

Additionally, the Court noted that a monthly salary of P325.00 is not considered a lucrative position for an applicant supporting a wife and three children [5].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED [6].
