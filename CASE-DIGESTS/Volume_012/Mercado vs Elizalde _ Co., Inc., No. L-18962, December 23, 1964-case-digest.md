I. CAPTION
SANTIAGO MERCADO v. ELIZALDE & COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-18962, December 23, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Santiago Mercado was employed as a watchman for Elizalde & Company, Inc. in Cebu City starting in 1947. Following the approval of the Minimum Wage Law (R.A. 602), Mercado requested a salary adjustment and overtime pay under the Eight-Hour Labor Law (C.A. 444). When the company ignored his request, he complained to the Wage Administration Service. The company threatened to dismiss him if he did not withdraw the complaint. Upon his refusal, he was terminated on September 30, 1956. Mercado subsequently filed an action before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu seeking reinstatement with back wages under the Minimum Wage Law and overtime pay. The CFI dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that the matter fell under the Court of Industrial Relations. Mercado appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over a claim for reinstatement with back wages involving the Minimum Wage Law and Eight-Hour Labor Law.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal, holding that the Court of First Instance lacked jurisdiction. The Court ruled that for the Court of Industrial Relations to acquire jurisdiction, the following must be present: (a) an employer-employee relationship or a claim for reinstatement; and (b) the controversy must relate to the Minimum Wage Law, Eight-Hour Labor Law, or unfair labor practice. Citing *Campos, et al. v. Manila Railroad Company, et al.*, the Court held that since Mercado sought reinstatement and his claims were based on the Minimum Wage Law and Eight-Hour Labor Law, the case falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations.

Decision affirmed.
