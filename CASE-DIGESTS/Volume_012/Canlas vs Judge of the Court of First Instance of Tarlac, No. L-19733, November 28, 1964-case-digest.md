I. CAPTION
ARSENIO L. CANLAS and ADENA GONZALES-CANLAS v. THE JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF TARLAC and JAIME TAYAG, G.R. No. L-19733, November 28, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Canlas filed a civil case (No. 3512) to enjoin respondent Tayag from operating a ricemill near their clinic. The trial court initially issued a preliminary injunction, which was later dissolved by Judge Aquino. The spouses appealed to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-16815), which reinstated the injunction on July 24, 1961, ruling that the dissolution was improper due to lack of verification and hearing [1].

Subsequently, Tayag filed a new petition with the trial court to lift the injunction, submitting necessary affidavits. On October 14, 1961, the trial court granted this petition and again dissolved the preliminary injunction [2]. Canlas filed the present petition for certiorari, arguing this second dissolution violated the Supreme Court's previous decision. The Supreme Court issued a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the October 14 order [3]. However, while this case was pending, the trial court rendered a decision on the merits in the main case (Civil Case No. 3512), dismissing the spouses' petition and the original preliminary injunction [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition to annul the order dissolving the preliminary injunction has become moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the issue has become academic. The preliminary injunction originally issued was intended to remain in force only until the main case was heard and decided on the merits [4]. Since the Court of First Instance has already rendered a decision on the merits dismissing the main petition—and consequently the preliminary injunction—the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Supreme Court in the present proceedings to maintain the status quo has become *functus officio*, its purpose having been attained [4].

The writ of preliminary injunction issued herein is dissolved and the case dismissed for being moot [5].
