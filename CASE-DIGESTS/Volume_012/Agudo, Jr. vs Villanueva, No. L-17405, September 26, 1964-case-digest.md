I. CAPTION
JOSE AGUDO, JR. v. JOSE R. VILLANUEVA, in his capacity as City Attorney of Butuan City, FRANCISCO MAGNO, in his capacity as Acting City Treasurer, and JUANITO SAGARAL, in his capacity as City Auditor, G.R. No. L-17405, September 26, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
The 1958-59 Budget of Butuan City authorized two positions for "Special Counsel" in the City Attorney's Office [1]. When one position was vacated, the City Mayor appointed petitioner Jose Agudo, Jr. to the post on January 12, 1960 [2]. His appointment was attested by the City Treasurer pursuant to Section 8 of the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. 2264), and he received salary until February 15, 1960 [2]. However, on January 20, 1960, the Secretary of Justice appointed Ricardo S. Castillo to the same position under the Revised Administrative Code [3].

Due to the conflicting appointments, the City Treasurer stopped paying Agudo, prompting him to file a petition for mandamus to compel the release of his salary [3]. Castillo intervened but the trial court ruled in favor of Agudo [3, 4]. Respondents appealed, arguing Agudo’s appointment was invalid because it designated him as "Special Counsel (Investigator-Researcher)" rather than just "Special Counsel" as stated in the budget [4, 5]. During the appeal, Castillo accepted a newly created position, effectively waiving his claim to the disputed office [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the discrepancy in the position title invalidates Agudo's appointment and bars him from collecting his salary via mandamus.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the addition of the words "(Investigator-Researcher)" in Agudo's appointment was of no importance and did not invalidate his title to the office [5]. The appointment explicitly stated he was replacing the former incumbent ("vice Attorney Francisco P. Parcon"), leaving no doubt as to the identity of the position [5]. The additional words were merely descriptive of the duties he was to discharge [5].

Regarding the salary, **YES**, Agudo is entitled to payment. The Court found that the position was created by the municipal board and payable from local funds [7]. Agudo's appointment by the City Mayor was attested by the City Treasurer as representative of the Civil Service Commissioner, complying with Section 8 of Republic Act 2264 [7]. Upon such attestation, the appointment became effective, entitling the appointee to the fixed compensation [7]. Since the respondents had already recognized the validity of the appointment by paying him previously, the payment of his salary is a ministerial duty enjoined by law [8].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [8].
