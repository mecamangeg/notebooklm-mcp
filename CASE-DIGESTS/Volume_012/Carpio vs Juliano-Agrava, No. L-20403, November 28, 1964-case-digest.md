I. CAPTION
TOMAS S. CARPIO, ET AL. v. HON. CORAZON JULIANO AGRAVA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20403, November 28, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J. [1]

II. FACTS
On May 18, 1962, petitioners Tomas S. Carpio, et al. filed a petition with the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court (JDRC) to remove Ephraim Gochangco as the guardian of the person of the ward, Justina Santos, and to appoint the petitioners in his stead [2]. They alleged animosity between the ward and guardian, disregard for the ward’s needs and health, and failure to account for expenses [3]. The petition was not verified [4]. Guardian Gochangco filed a verified opposition denying the charges, stating he accounted to the guardian of the estate, Security Bank [4].

Respondent Judge Corazon Juliano-Agrava initially declined to give due course to the petition, stating that "dislike" is not a valid ground for removal and that the allegations did not justify a hearing [5]. However, the Judge subsequently visited the ward personally at her residence [6]. During the two-hour visit, the Judge inspected the ward's living conditions and conversed with her, finding the claims of animosity and neglect to be untrue [7], [8]. Consequently, the Judge denied the petition without a formal hearing for the reception of petitioners' evidence [9]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, alleging abuse of discretion [10].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the petition for removal of the guardian without a formal hearing to receive evidence. [10]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the respondent Judge did not commit any abuse of discretion. The removal of a guardian is a matter addressed to the discretion of the court (*25 Am. Jur., 39; Padilla Vda. de Bengzon v. Philippine National Bank*) [9]. The Court noted that the petition for removal was unverified, whereas the guardian’s answer was verified [8], [9].

Furthermore, while due process generally requires that petitioners be given an opportunity to present evidence as requested, this requirement was **obviated by the visit paid by the respondent Judge to the ward** [9]. The ocular inspection convinced the Judge of the groundlessness of the charges regarding animosity and neglect, rendering a formal hearing unnecessary [11], [9].

Petition dismissed. [12]
