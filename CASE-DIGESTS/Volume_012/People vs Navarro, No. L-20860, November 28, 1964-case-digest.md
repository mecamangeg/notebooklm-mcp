I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GLICERIO NAVARRO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20860, November 28, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On August 4, 1952, in Koronadal, Cotabato, accused-appellant Glicerio Navarro and his brother Jaime Navarro, after a drinking spree, stalked the victim, Alfredo Debil. When Debil paused to urinate with his back turned, Jaime hit him on the head with a piece of wood. Glicerio and an unidentified companion followed suit, striking Debil with the wood and a Coca-Cola bottle. Debil died on the spot from a depressed skull fracture. The defense invoked alibi and imputed the crime to one Ricardo Arroyo, but the trial court discredited this due to inconsistencies and unnatural behavior of defense witnesses.

The Court of First Instance convicted the accused of Murder and sentenced them to 12 years of *prision mayor* to 20 years of *reclusion temporal*. The Court of Appeals affirmed the factual findings of guilt but certified the case to the Supreme Court, believing the penalty should be *reclusion perpetua*. During pendency, Jaime withdrew his appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the crime committed is Murder.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The crime committed is only **Homicide**.

The Court ruled that while the aggravating circumstance of **treachery** was proven—as the attack was sudden, from behind, and while the victim was urinating—it cannot qualify the crime to Murder because it was not expressly alleged as a qualifying circumstance in the Information [1]. A qualifying circumstance not alleged in the Information, although proven, may only be considered as a generic aggravating circumstance [2].

Furthermore, **evident premeditation** was not present. The prosecution failed to prove a mature and cold reflection to kill; the decision to attack was made instantaneously when the accused saw the victim pass by [3].

Under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for Homicide is *reclusion temporal*. Since the crime is Homicide aggravated by treachery (treated generically) with no mitigating circumstances, the penalty imposed by the lower court (12 years to 20 years) is within the correct legal range. The decision is **AFFIRMED** [4].
