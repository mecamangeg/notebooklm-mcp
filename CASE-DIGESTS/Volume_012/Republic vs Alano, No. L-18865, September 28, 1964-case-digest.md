I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JUAN S. ALANO, G.R. No. L-18865, September 28, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On December 9, 1960, the Republic filed a complaint against Juan S. Alano to recover deficiency income taxes for the years 1947 to 1951. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) had originally issued an assessment on January 13, 1956, for P111,234.53. Alano protested this assessment and requested a reconsideration. Consequently, on November 11, 1957, the BIR issued a final revised assessment reducing the liability to P15,863.18. Alano moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of prescription, arguing the assessment was made beyond the five-year period prescribed by law. The Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissed the complaint. The Republic appealed, arguing that the revised assessment should be deemed effective as of the date of the original assessment (January 13, 1956), which was within the prescriptive period [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the final revised assessment for deficiency income taxes is barred by the statute of limitations under Section 331 of the Internal Revenue Code.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The assessment is barred by prescription. Section 331 of the Internal Revenue Code requires that internal revenue taxes be assessed within five years after the return was filed [4]. Counting from the last required filing date of March 31, 1951, the five-year period expired on March 31, 1956. The final revised assessment issued on November 11, 1957, which superseded and annulled the original assessment, was clearly beyond the statutory period [5].

The Court rejected the Republic's argument that the revised assessment should relate back to the original assessment date. A mere protest and petition for reconsideration does not stop the running of the prescriptive period unless there is a resulting reinvestigation and introduction of new evidence, or if the taxpayer attempts to delay proceedings [5]. Here, Alano only asked once for reexamination on the same record and evidence. Furthermore, the Court noted that the drastic reduction of the original assessment to one-ninth of the amount proved the first assessment was "recklessly made" and "oppressive," solely to intimidate the taxpayer, and thus cannot be sanctioned [6].

The order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED** [7].
