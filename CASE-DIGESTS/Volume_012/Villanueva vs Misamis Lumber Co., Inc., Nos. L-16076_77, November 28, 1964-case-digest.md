I. CAPTION
ESTEBAN VILLANUEVA v. MISAMIS LUMBER CO., INC., ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-16076–77, November 28, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Simeon Ledesma held a possessory information title over a tract of land in Misamis Occidental, registered in 1894, having been in possession since 1887. Upon his death in 1900, his children succeeded him. In 1925 and 1929, the children sold the land to Misamis Lumber Co. (Respondent), which took actual possession, cleared 30 hectares, and cultivated it through tenants.

In 1934, the Director of Lands instituted Cadastral Case No. 17 covering Lot No. 5308. Respondent claimed a portion (Lot 5308-A) based on the Ledesma title. Meanwhile, Esteban Villanueva (Petitioner) filed Civil Case No. 859 to recover possession of 30 hectares within the same lot, claiming ownership via a sales application approved by the Bureau of Lands.

Petitioner argued that Respondent’s claim was barred by *res judicata* due to a 1933 Supreme Court decision (*Misamis Lumber Co. v. Director of Lands*, 57 Phil. 881) which dismissed Respondent's previous registration application for failing to identify the land and finding it was "mostly covered with forest." The Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Respondent, declaring it the owner of Lot 5308-A and dismissing Villanueva’s complaint.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Respondent acquired valid title of ownership over the land.
2. W/N the previous judgment in *Misamis Lumber Co. v. Director of Lands* constitutes *res judicata* to bar Respondent’s claim.
3. W/N Petitioner’s sales application prevails over Respondent’s title.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the possessory information title registered in 1894 ripened into a title of ownership in 1914 after 20 years of continuous possession, as there was no evidence of legal interruption [1]. Furthermore, the doctrine that only actual occupancy ripens an imperfect title did not apply because Respondent acquired the land via public instrument (symbolic tradition) coupled with actual possession of 30 hectares. Possession of a part is constructive possession of the whole (*Ramos v. Director of Lands*) [2].

2. **NO.** The defense of *res judicata* fails because there is no identity of subject matter. The previous 1933 decision dismissed the application because the applicant failed to properly identify the land (applying for 668 hectares versus the title’s 278 hectares). The finding that "most" of the land was forest did not specify if the specific area now in question was covered by forest [3]. The identity of the current land was established by natural boundaries (rivers/creeks) which prevail over estimated areas in the old Spanish title [4].

3. **NO.** Since the land was already private property of Misamis Lumber Co. when Villanueva filed his sales application in 1926, the Bureau of Lands had no authority to sell it. A sales application cannot affect land that has already been acquired by prescription (*Garcia v. Dinero*) [5, 6].

**Judgment affirmed.**
