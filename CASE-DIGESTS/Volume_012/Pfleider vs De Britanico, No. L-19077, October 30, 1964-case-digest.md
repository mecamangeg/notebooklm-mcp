I. CAPTION
WILLIAM G. PFLEIDER v. SERVILIANA CORDOVA DE BRITANICO, et al., G.R. No. L-19077, October 30, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff William Pfleider filed an action (Civil Case No. 6161) in the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental against defendant Serviliana Cordova de Britanico for the rescission of a lease contract, ejectment, and restoration of possession of certain parcels of land [1].

C.N. Hodges filed a motion for leave to intervene, alleging that the properties were registered in his name under TCT No. 33345 and that a decision delivering possession to Pfleider would conflict with a prior judgment and writ of execution in Hodges' favor (Civil Case No. 2860) [2]. The trial court denied the motion to intervene because there was already a pending interpleader case (Civil Case No. 6146) filed by Britanico against both Pfleider and Hodges involving practically the same issues [2]. Hodges appealed the denial to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in denying the motion to intervene.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court found no reversible error and affirmed the lower court's order. The rule on intervention allows the trial court to exercise discretion (Sec. 2, Rule 12, Revised Rules of Court), and there was no showing of abuse [3].

Specifically, Section 2(b) of Rule 12 provides that in allowing or disallowing intervention, the court shall consider "whether or not the intervenor's rights may be fully protected in a separate proceeding" [4]. The Court held that Hodges' rights were fully protected in the pending interpleader action (Civil Case No. 6146) [3, 5]. Furthermore, the present case was an action *in personam*, and any judgment rendered therein would not prejudice Hodges, who was not a party to the suit [5, 6].

The order appealed from is affirmed [5].
