I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JOAQUIN QUIMSING, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19860, December 23, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Joaquin Quimsing and others were charged with illegal cockfighting in the Municipal Court of Iloilo (Criminal Case No. 18926) [1]. The proceedings were suspended pending a Supreme Court decision on the validity of the relevant city ordinance, which was later declared invalid [1]. Following arraignment where the accused pleaded not guilty, the case underwent two dismissals [1, 2].

First, on September 27, 1961, the court ordered a "provisional dismissal" because the prosecution was not ready; however, this was reconsidered when the prosecutor arrived. Although the defense initially objected on double jeopardy grounds, they subsequently agreed to postpone the trial and appeared at the next hearing ready for trial [2-4].

Second, on March 8, 1962, the prosecution was again not ready, and the court dismissed the case *motu proprio* [3]. Upon denial of the fiscal's motion for reconsideration, the court asked if the accused consented to a provisional dismissal. Defense counsel replied, "I think they agree," and the court declared the case "provisionally dismissed with the consent of the accused" [3].

The fiscal refiled the charges the next day (Criminal Case No. 28421) [5]. The Municipal Court granted the accused's motion to quash on the ground of double jeopardy, which was affirmed by the Court of First Instance [5]. The People appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the refiling of the case is barred by double jeopardy.
2. W/N the prosecution can appeal the order of dismissal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO**. The Court ruled that the accused are in estoppel to plead double jeopardy [6]. Regarding the first dismissal, the accused waived the defense by agreeing to a postponement and manifesting readiness for trial instead of taking steps to enjoin further proceedings [4]. Regarding the second dismissal, it was expressly "provisional" and made with the *express consent* of the accused through their counsel [6]. When a case is dismissed with the express consent of the defendant, the dismissal is not a bar to another prosecution for the same offense because such consent constitutes a waiver of the constitutional right against double jeopardy [7].

2. **YES**. The prosecution may appeal the ruling because the accused had not yet entered a plea to the *refiled* information (Case No. 28421) [8, 9]. It is a settled principle that the prosecution may appeal provided the accused is not thereby placed in second jeopardy; since no plea was entered in the new case, no jeopardy had attached regarding that specific information [9, 10].

The orders of the lower court sustaining the motion to quash are set aside, and the case is remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings [11].
