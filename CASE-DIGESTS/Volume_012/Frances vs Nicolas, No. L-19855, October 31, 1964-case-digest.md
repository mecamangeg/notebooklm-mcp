I. CAPTION
GREGORIO FRANCES, ET AL. v. CRISPULO NICOLAS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19855, October 31, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In a previous case (G.R. No. L-7747), the Supreme Court nullified the conveyances of a homestead lot made by the heirs of Nicolas to the plaintiffs (Frances) and ordered the return of the land to the heirs upon their refund of the price paid [1]. Upon remand to the lower court, the heirs claimed the price was only P2,500. The lower court issued an order on August 2, 1956, directing plaintiffs to turn over possession upon the refund of P2,500 [2, 3]. Plaintiffs filed a petition for certiorari (G.R. No. L-11249) to annul this order, but the Supreme Court dismissed it for lack of merit [3]. Over four years later, plaintiffs filed the present complaint to recover the alleged actual price of P13,700, claiming the heirs fraudulently misrepresented the amount in the previous proceedings [2, 4]. The lower court dismissed the complaint, ruling it was barred by the prior decisions [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs may reopen the issue regarding the amount collectible from the defendants after the previous order fixing said amount became final.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the lower court's orders of August 2 and 23, 1956, partook of the nature of a judgment insofar as they fixed the amount recoverable by the plaintiffs [6]. Since the plaintiffs did not appeal these orders, and their petition for certiorari (G.R. No. L-11249) challenging them was dismissed, the orders became final and executory [6]. Consequently, the issue regarding the sum collectible is definitely settled by said orders and can no longer be reopened in proceedings instituted four years later [6]. The Court cited *Soriano vs. Sahagun* to support the finality of the judgment [6].

Orders affirmed [7].
