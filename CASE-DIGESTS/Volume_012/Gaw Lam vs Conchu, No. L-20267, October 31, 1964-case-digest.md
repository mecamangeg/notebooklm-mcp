I. CAPTION
GAW LAM, ETC., ET AL. v. HON. AGAPITO CONCHU, G.R. No. L-20267, October 31, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Gaw Lam, a Chinese national granted Philippine citizenship in 1961, sought to prevent the deportation of his wife and minor children. His family arrived in the Philippines on September 8, 1961, as temporary visitors with a three-month stay limit, posting cash bonds and swearing affidavits that they would not change their status [1, 2]. Despite these undertakings, they requested a change of status to special non-immigrants. The Secretary of Foreign Affairs and the Undersecretary of Justice initially endorsed an extension of their stay until 1963, subject to certain conditions [3]. However, the Commissioner of Immigration insisted on their deportation upon the expiration of their original permits on March 30, 1962 [4]. Gaw Lam filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, arguing that the Secretaries' authorization prevented the Commissioner from deporting them [4, 5]. The CFI dismissed the petition, prompting this appeal to the Supreme Court [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Secretary of Foreign Affairs is authorized to extend the temporary stay of aliens in the Philippines over the authority of the Commissioner of Immigration.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. Relying on *Ang Liong v. Commissioner of Immigration*, the Court ruled that under Commonwealth Act No. 613 (The Philippine Immigration Act of 1940), the Commissioner of Immigration is the administrative head in charge of all laws relating to the immigration of aliens [7]. Section 47 of the same Act empowers the President, not the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, to admit aliens as non-immigrants or prescribe conditions for their temporary stay [7]. Consequently, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs has no authority to extend the period of stay authorized by the Commissioner. Furthermore, the Court noted that the Cabinet resolution previously granting concurrent jurisdiction to the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and Justice was deemed without force and effect by the Secretaries themselves in subsequent cases, recognizing the Commissioner's exclusive power [8]. Finally, the petitioners failed to comply with the specific conditions attached to the Justice Undersecretary's endorsement, such as securing re-entry permits [9].

The order appealed from is affirmed [10].
