I. CAPTION
VIDAL PAULINO v. ADELAIDA ROSENDO and THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-20484, November 28, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Vidal Paulino, along with Amado de la Cruz and Anastaquio Manuel, engaged in a joint venture of buying watermelons in Pangasinan and transporting them by cargo truck to Manila for sale [1]. Each partner invested P1,000 [2]. They hired Vicente Nieto as a guard for the produce [2]. On March 28, 1960, while Nieto was guarding the watermelons in Pangasinan, he was killed by robbers [2].

Nieto’s widow, respondent Adelaida Rosendo, filed a claim under the Workmen’s Compensation Act [1]. Regional Office No. 3 ruled in her favor, ordering the payment of P4,200 in total compensation [3]. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed the decision [4]. Paulino appealed, arguing that: (1) the business was exempt from the Act because its capital was less than P10,000; (2) Nieto was a partner, not an employee; and (3) the death was not compensable as the motive was robbery [5-7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner’s business is covered by the Workmen’s Compensation Act despite having a capital of less than P10,000.
2. W/N the death of the deceased is compensable under the Act.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that for the exemption from the Workmen’s Compensation Act to operate, two requisites must concur: the capital must be less than P10,000 *and* the business must not be hazardous [8]. Although the capital requirement was met, the business was classified as hazardous because it involved the regular use of a cargo truck to transport watermelons from Pangasinan to Manila [5, 9]. The Court cited *Paez v. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission*, ruling that the use of motor vehicles to transport goods creates risks (accidents, hold-ups) that make a business inherently hazardous [9].

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the presumption that where death occurs in the course of employment, it is presumed to have arisen out of said employment and is therefore compensable, citing *Iloilo Drydock and Engineering Co. v. Workmen’s Compensation Commission* [10]. The petitioner failed to present substantial evidence to rebut the finding that Nieto was an employee or to prove the injury was occasioned by willful intent [6, 11]. The computation of P4,000 in death benefits and P200 for burial expenses was found to be in accordance with Sections 8(a) and 19 of Act 3428 [12-14].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [15].
