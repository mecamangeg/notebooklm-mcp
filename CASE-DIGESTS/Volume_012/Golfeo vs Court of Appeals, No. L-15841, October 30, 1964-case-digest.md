I. CAPTION
**CALIXTO GOLFEO, in his capacity as Judicial Administrator of the Intestate of the deceased Rufina Gerona v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and SO CHU BEE**, G.R. No. L-15841, October 30, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Rufino Gerona, who died in 1940, owned a 28-hectare land in Bulan, Sorsogon. Respondent So Chu Bee had possessed the land since 1926, allegedly through a sale. In a previous suit filed in 1949 (CA-G.R. 8063-R) to quiet title, the Court of Appeals declared the alleged sale fictitious and held that So Chu Bee possessed the land merely in trust for Gerona’s heirs [1, 2].

In 1955, petitioner Calixto Golfeo, as administrator of Gerona's estate, filed the present suit to recover the land. The Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeals dismissed the complaint, ruling that So Chu Bee had acquired the land through adverse possession for over ten years. The lower courts reckoned the prescriptive period from 1940, when So Chu Bee transferred the tax declaration into his name [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent So Chu Bee acquired ownership of the subject land through acquisitive prescription.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the appellate court’s decision. Generally, a trustee cannot acquire realty held in trust through adverse possession unless there is an unequivocal act of repudiation made known to the *cestui que trust* [3].

The Court held that the transfer of the tax declaration in 1940 did not constitute an unequivocal act of repudiation amounting to ouster, as it could have been done surreptitiously. Citing *Laguna v. Levantino* (71 Phil. 566), the Court reiterated that declaring land for tax purposes alone is insufficient to constitute adverse possession against a *cestui que trust* [5]. The only valid proof of adverse possession was So Chu Bee’s refusal to share products with the heirs, which occurred in 1946. Since the present suit was filed in October 1955, the lapse of time was less than the required ten-year prescriptive period [6].

Consequently, the petition is **GRANTED**. The judgment is reversed, and the land is adjudged to belong to the intestate of Rufino Gerona. So Chu Bee is directed to turn over the property and pay damages amounting to P32,532.00 (up to 1957) and P2,000.00 yearly thereafter [7].
