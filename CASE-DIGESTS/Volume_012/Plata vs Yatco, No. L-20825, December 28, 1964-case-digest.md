I. CAPTION
AMALIA PLATA v. HON. NICASIO YATCO, Judge, Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch V; BENITO MACROHON, Sheriff of Quezon City and The Spouses CESAREA E. VILLANUEVA and GREGORIO LEAÑO, G.R. No. L-20825, December 28, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Amalia Plata purchased a parcel of land in Caloocan in 1954 while single. In 1958, she sold it to Celso Saldaña, who resold it to her seven months later; the new title designated her as "Amalia Plata, married to Gaudencio Begosa." On the same day as the resale, Plata mortgaged the property to Respondent Cesarea Villanueva to secure a loan. Plata declared herself the absolute owner in the mortgage deed, while her husband, Gaudencio Begosa, signed only as a co-mortgagor.

After the mortgage was extrajudicially foreclosed, Villanueva acquired the property. Villanueva then sued Begosa *alone* for illegal detainer and obtained a final judgment against him. A writ of execution was issued, but Plata resisted ejectment, asserting independent ownership. The trial court (Judge Yatco) cited Plata for contempt for refusing to vacate and sentenced her to pay a fine. Plata filed this petition for certiorari to annul the contempt order.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the property is conjugal property.
2. W/N the wife is bound by the illegal detainer judgment against her husband alone regarding her paraphernal property.
3. W/N the wife is guilty of contempt for refusing to vacate.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The property is paraphernal. Plata acquired the land while single. The subsequent conveyance to a third party and reconveyance to her did not transform it into conjugal property, absent proof that the money used for reconveyance came from conjugal funds (Civil Code, Art. 153). Furthermore, the fact that the husband signed the mortgage as a co-mortgagor does not convert paraphernal property into conjugal property, especially where the deed recites that the wife is the sole mortgagor and absolute owner.

2. **NO.** An illegal detainer judgment against the husband alone over paraphernal property cannot bind or affect the wife's possession. Under the Civil Code (Arts. 136, 137, 140), the wife holds and administers her paraphernal property independently and may encumber or alienate it without the husband's consent.

3. **NO.** Since the petitioner was not made a party defendant in the eviction suit against her husband, she could validly ignore the judgment of eviction. It was no contempt of court for her to do so because the writ of execution was not lawful against her.

The petition is GRANTED, the order of the lower court is annulled and set aside, and the preliminary injunction is made permanent.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
