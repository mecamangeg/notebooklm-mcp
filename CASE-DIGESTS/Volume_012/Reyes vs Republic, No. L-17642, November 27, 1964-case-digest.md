**I. CAPTION**
CANDIDA REYES, in her own behalf and as Guardian Ad Litem, EDGARDO SO, RENATO SO, ROMEO REYES SO, all minors, and SO YONG GA v. THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and THE LOCAL CIVIL REGISTRAR OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-17642, November 27, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners Candida Reyes (acting for herself and as guardian of minors Edgardo, Renato, and Romeo Reyes So) and So Yong Ga filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of Manila to correct entries in the civil register of Manila [1, 2]. They invoked Article 412 of the Civil Code, arguing that the law allows the correction of any entry in the civil register, whether clerical or substantial, provided there is a judicial order [2]. The Republic of the Philippines moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that it stated no cause of action [2]. The lower court dismissed the petition. Petitioners appealed, maintaining that their petition was the appropriate action to establish the Philippine citizenship of the minor children and correct the registry [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a petition for correction of entries in the civil registry involving nationality or citizenship may be granted through the summary proceeding authorized under Article 412 of the Civil Code.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. The Court held that only mistakes that are **clerical** in nature may be ordered corrected under Article 412 of the Civil Code, which contemplates a summary procedure [3, 4]. Where the petition seeks the correction of entries that are substantial—such as those involving civil status or citizenship—the erroneous entry may only be corrected by means of a **proper action** (adversarial proceeding) where all affected parties are notified and evidence is submitted [4, 5].

The Court observed that while the petition ostensibly sought a correction of entries, it effectively requested a judicial declaration of Philippine citizenship, for which declaratory relief is not available [6]. Furthermore, Rule 108 of the Rules of Court, which governs the cancellation or correction of entries, excludes details such as nationality or citizenship from the particulars attendant to "birth" that may be corrected [5, 7].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, J.P. Bengzon, and Zaldivar concurred with the decision [8].
