I. CAPTION
FLORENTINA CALMA, together with her husband ENRIQUE ONTANILLAS v. JOSE MONTUYA, FELIX CARIAS, QUIRINA CARIAS, DOMINGO CARIAS and ILUMINADA CARIAS, together with her husband, SILVESTRE ANTONIANA, G.R. No. L-18674, September 30, 1964, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
In 1922, defendant Felix Carias, the registered owner of Lot No. 1463, sold a one-half portion of the land to Eulogio Iniego via a notarial document [1]. Iniego and his successor, plaintiff Florentina Calma (his granddaughter), possessed the land openly and continuously [1]. However, on October 31, 1960, Carias and his co-defendants sold the same portion to defendant Jose Montuya through a "Deed of Adjudication and Sale" [1].

On January 17, 1961, Calma filed a complaint for declaration of ownership and rescission of the 1960 sale, alleging that Montuya bought the land in bad faith, knowing of the prior sale to Iniego [1, 2]. The defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss on the grounds that the complaint stated no cause of action and that the action had prescribed [2]. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo granted the motion and dismissed the complaint [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the complaint states a sufficient cause of action.
2. W/N the action has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to constitute a cause of action [3]. The test of sufficiency is whether a competent court could render a valid judgment if the facts alleged were admitted [3]. Admitting the facts in the complaint—that the land was sold to plaintiffs' predecessor in 1922 and subsequently sold to Montuya in 1960 in bad faith—a judgment for ownership could be rendered [3]. The Court emphasized that even if the 1922 sale was unregistered, it does not preclude a cause of action against valid parties to the sale or third parties who acted in bad faith with knowledge of the prior unregistered sale [3].

2. **NO.** The action has not prescribed [4, 5]. Under Article 1150 of the New Civil Code, the prescriptive period is counted from the time the action may be brought [5]. A cause of action requires both a right and an act or omission violating that right [5]. In this case, the plaintiffs' right was only violated and disturbed upon the execution of the second sale on October 31, 1960 [5]. Since the complaint was filed on January 17, 1961, the action was well within the prescriptive period [5].

The orders appealed from are **SET ASIDE** and the case is **REMANDED** to the court *a quo* for further proceedings [6].
