I. CAPTION
NATIONAL MINES & ALLIED WORKERS' UNION v. PHILIPPINE IRON MINES, INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-19372, October 31, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On November 9, 1957, the National Mines and Allied Workers’ Union filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Norte against Philippine Iron Mines, Inc. and its resident manager. The Union alleged that the company violated the seniority provision of their Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) by laying off seven union members without just cause [1]. The company admitted the lay-offs but justified them as an exercise of its management prerogative under the CBA to reduce force due to a lack of work [2].

The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that the company validly exercised its prerogative [3]. The Union appealed to the Court of Appeals. However, the appellate court hesitated to decide the case, noting that since the Union sought the **reinstatement** of laid-off employees, the case might fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) pursuant to the ruling in *Price Stabilization Corp. v. CIR*. Consequently, the Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court to determine which court had jurisdiction [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over a complaint seeking reinstatement and enforcement of a CBA, absent any unfair labor practice charge.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the complaint was correctly filed in the Court of First Instance [6].

Under Republic Act No. 875, for the Court of Industrial Relations to acquire jurisdiction, the following circumstances must be present: (a) there must exist an employer-employee relationship or the claimant must seek reinstatement; **and** (b) the controversy must relate to a case certified by the President as involving national interest, or must have a bearing on an unfair labor practice charge, or must arise under the Eight-Hour Labor Law or Minimum Wage Law [7].

In this case, while reinstatement was sought, there was no allegation that the lay-off was due to any unfair labor practice, nor did it involve the Eight-Hour Labor Law, Minimum Wage Law, or a national interest certification [8]. A mere claim for reinstatement does not suffice to bring a case within the CIR's jurisdiction; without the accompanying circumstances enumerated above, the claim becomes a mere money claim or contract dispute under the jurisdiction of the regular courts [9], [7].

Accordingly, the case was returned to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings [6].
