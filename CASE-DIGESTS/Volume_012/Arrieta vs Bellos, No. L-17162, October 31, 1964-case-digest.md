I. CAPTION
MIGUEL P. ARRIETA v. HONORIO BELLOS and SERAFIN L. TEVES, G.R. No. L-17162, October 31, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In April 1952, petitioner Miguel P. Arrieta was appointed Deputy Governor of Negros Oriental by then-Governor Bandoquillo. Following the election of a new Governor, respondent Serafin L. Teves, Arrieta applied for a leave of absence and a transfer to another branch in January 1956. Teves appointed respondent Honorio Bellos as Deputy Governor and approved Arrieta's leave on the condition that his services would be terminated upon its expiration.

Arrieta sought reinstatement, initially securing an opinion from the Civil Service Commissioner that the position was not primarily confidential. However, upon appeal by Teves, the Executive Secretary (by authority of the President) declared on August 27, 1956, that the position was primarily confidential pursuant to Sec. 671(1) of the Revised Administrative Code. Arrieta filed a petition for *quo warranto*, which the Court of First Instance dismissed. The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal, ruling the position was confidential and the action was filed out of time.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the position of Deputy Governor is primarily confidential in nature.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed that the position of Deputy Governor is primarily confidential. The Court found that the duties of the Deputy Governor were defined by the Provincial Governor and consisted of tasks delegated or assigned by him, such as inspecting and supervising local offices and investigating complaints [1]. The Court held that "more than ordinary confidence and trust is necessary to induce a provincial governor to farm out such duties and functions to a deputy" [2]. Furthermore, the Executive Secretary's ruling on August 27, 1956, was merely declaratory of the true nature of the position [2]. As the position is primarily confidential, petitioner's term expired upon loss of confidence. The judgment of the Court of Appeals was affirmed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Barrera, J., concurred in the result.
