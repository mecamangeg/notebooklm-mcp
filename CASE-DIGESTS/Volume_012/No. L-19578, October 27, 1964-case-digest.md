I. CAPTION
In the Matter of the Petition of Pedro T. Uy alias Dodong to be Admitted a Citizen of the Philippines: PEDRO T. UY alias DODONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19578, October 27, 1964, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pedro T. Uy, a citizen of Nationalist China born in Dumaguete City, filed a petition for naturalization on January 23, 1961. He is married to a Filipina, Petra Mores, with whom he has three children below school age. To support his petition, he presented the City Treasurer and City Mayor of Dumaguete as character witnesses, who testified they had known him since 1941. However, their knowledge of Uy was derived principally from occasions when he went to their public offices to transact business.

Regarding his financial capacity, Uy worked as a salesman earning P130.00 monthly with free board and lodging (valued at P30-P40/month) and commissions averaging P40.00 monthly. He also earned a net average of P140.00 monthly from operating seven pedicabs. His total annual income was approximately P4,200.00. His wife separately earned P110.00 monthly from inherited coconut lands. The Court of First Instance of Negros Oriental granted the petition, prompting the Republic to appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the character witnesses were competent to vouch for the petitioner's moral character.
2. W/N the petitioner proved he had a lucrative trade, profession, or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the character witnesses were not in a position to vouch for the petitioner. Their knowledge of him was based on occasional business dealings in public offices, which afford little room for personal matters and do not provide a reliable basis for gauging a person's moral character. Citing *Cuaki Tan Si vs. Republic* and *Lim vs. Republic*, the Court emphasized that witnesses must have intimate knowledge and personal observation of the applicant's conduct.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that a total annual income of P4,200.00 is not lucrative for a married applicant with three children. The Court relied on *Koa vs. Republic* (where P5,980/year was held not lucrative for a similar family size) and *Tan vs. Republic* (where P6,300/year was not lucrative for a married applicant with one child). Furthermore, the wife's income from her coconut lands was excluded from the computation because the law requires the lucrative income to be from the petitioner's own "trade, profession or lawful occupation."

The judgment of the lower court was reversed and the petition for naturalization was denied.
