I. CAPTION
THE UNITED STATES LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK v. CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20674, December 29, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellee United States Life Insurance Company (US Life), a foreign corporation licensed in the Philippines, purchased Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC) 1st Series Bonds worth P250,000 on January 8, 1949 [1]. Upon their maturity on April 1, 1957, the proceeds were not paid to US Life but were immediately reinvested by RFC into 4% 25th Series Bonds, which subsequently matured on December 1, 1960 [1].

When US Life sought to remit the redemption proceeds of the 25th Series Bonds to its home office, it applied for exemption from the payment of the foreign exchange margin fee under Republic Act No. 2609 [2]. The Central Bank denied the exemption for the principal amount, arguing that the exemption applied only to obligations outstanding or bonds acquired prior to June 16, 1956 [3]. The Central Bank contended that the substitution of the 1st Series Bonds with the 25th Series Bonds in 1957 constituted a novation and a new purchase occurring after the cutoff date [4]. US Life paid the margin fee of P33,251.54 under protest and filed a suit for refund [5]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of US Life, holding that the 25th Series Bonds were merely a continuation of the original 1949 investment [3, 6]. The Central Bank appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the substitution of the RFC 1st Series Bonds with the 25th Series Bonds constituted a novation that extinguished the original obligation, making the latter a new purchase subject to margin fees.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that the substitution of the 1st Series Bonds with the 25th Series Bonds gave rise to a novation, making the subsequent transaction a distinct and completely new purchase [7].

Citing *The Law on Bonds and Bond Securities* by Leonard A. Jones, the Court established the rule that if a bondholder gives up his bonds and accepts other securities in their place, there is, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, a novation of the debt, a payment of the former obligation, and a substitution of the latter [8]. The new securities, as soon as issued, extinguish the old debt [9]. US Life failed to present evidence that the acquisition of the second series was meant as a mere continuation of the first issue; thus, the 25th Series Bonds constituted full payment of the RFC's obligation under the first series [9, 10].

Since the 25th Series Bonds are deemed a new purchase made in 1957 (after the June 16, 1956 cutoff), they are not exempt from the margin fee under R.A. 2609 [3]. The Court also rejected the argument that the fee breached the government's guarantee of full return, noting that the fee is levied on the privilege of remitting proceeds to the US, not on the proceeds themselves [10].

The decision appealed from is reversed and set aside, and the Central Bank is absolved from the order to refund [11].
