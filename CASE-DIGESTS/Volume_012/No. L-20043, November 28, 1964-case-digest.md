I. CAPTION
LOURDES RAMIREZ-CUADERNO v. ANGEL CUADERNO, G.R. No. L-20043, November 28, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On November 17, 1956, respondent Angel Cuaderno inflicted bodily injuries on his wife, petitioner Lourdes Ramirez-Cuaderno, during a quarrel. He then took her to her mother's house and left her there [1, 2]. Lourdes filed a complaint for support on August 14, 1957. The Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court ruled in her favor, ordering Angel to pay P150.00 monthly support [3]. Angel appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which reversed the trial court's decision and set aside the support order, admonishing the spouses to resume cohabitation instead [3]. Lourdes filed this petition for review, arguing she was driven out of the conjugal dwelling due to maltreatment [1, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the wife is entitled to separate support despite the Court of Appeals' admonition for the spouses to resume cohabitation.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that while marriage entitles both parties to cohabitation or consortium, the sanction for such is the "spontaneous, mutual affection between husband and wife and not any legal mandate or court order" [5]. It was undisputed that the husband caused the separation by inflicting physical injuries on the wife and taking her to her parents' home [2]. Additionally, the husband himself expressed that the trouble given by the wife was enough for him to "turn his back to her," making cohabitation impossible at the time [4, 5]. Given that the wife had no income and the husband was employed, and since the Court could not compel the parties to live together against their will, the husband was obligated to provide separate maintenance. The P150.00 monthly support fixed by the trial court was deemed reasonable [2].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is set aside, and the decision of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court is revived [6].
