I. CAPTION
PABLO ALMARINEZ v. CRESENCIANA MANABAT-POTENCIANO, DIONISIA MANABAT-LOPEZ, FLAVIANA MANABAT and HERMENEGILDO CARIÑO, G.R. No. L-17020, November 9, 1964, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Almarinez was the tenant of respondents' four-hectare riceland in Biñan, Laguna. On February 12, 1958, respondents filed a petition for ejectment in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR), alleging that Almarinez deliberately excavated the land using a bulldozer without their consent, causing serious injury. Almarinez admitted the excavation but claimed it was with consent for improvement. He also filed a counterclaim for the reliquidation of harvests from 1951 to 1957.

The CAR found that the excavation was Almarinez's sole initiative, which impaired the land's productive capacity by scraping paddies and filling irrigation canals. Consequently, the CAR authorized his ejectment. Regarding the counterclaim, the CAR awarded Almarinez his share deficiency but limited the liability to the crop years 1955-1957, ruling that respondents were not liable for shares accruing before they became landholders in 1955. Almarinez appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the tenant may be ejected for the act of deliberately excavating the land.
2. W/N the transferee-landholders are liable for the tenant's share deficiency corresponding to the period before they acquired the land.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the ejectment but clarified the legal ground. While the lower court cited Section 50(f) of Republic Act No. 1199 (negligence), the Court ruled that the proper ground was Section 50(b) (violation of the Act) because the injury was caused by the tenant's "positive and deliberate act." The excavation violated the tenant's duty to take care of the farm "as a good father of the family" (Sec. 23, par. 1) and to maintain dikes and irrigation canals (Sec. 38, par. 3). Such deliberate damage justifies ejectment.

2. **YES.** Under Section 9 of Republic Act No. 1199, the sale or transfer of the land does not extinguish the tenancy relationship, and the transferee assumes the rights and obligations of the former landholder. Therefore, the respondents are liable for the tenant's lawful share even for the agricultural year 1954-1955, prior to their ownership. The Court held that the tenant's right to his share is unhampered by transfers, and the respondents may simply proceed against the former landholder for reimbursement.

The judgment is **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**, increasing the reliquidation award to include the 1954-1955 crop year share.
