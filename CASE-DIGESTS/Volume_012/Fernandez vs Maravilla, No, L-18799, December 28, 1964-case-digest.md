I. CAPTION
HON. JOSE F. FERNANDEZ, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, ASUNCION MARAVILLA, ET AL. v. HERMINIO MARAVILLA, G.R. No. L-18799, December 28, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners filed a second motion for reconsideration regarding an appealed order from the lower court [1]. The specific order in question involved the appointment of Eliezer Lopez as a special co-administrator [1]. Respondent Herminio Maravilla, who served as the special administrator, opposed the motion [1]. The petitioners sought to sustain the lower court's appointment of Lopez pending the determination of the main case [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appointment of Eliezer Lopez as special co-administrator should be sustained.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the appointment of Eliezer Lopez as special co-administrator would bring no material damage to the respondent special administrator, Herminio Maravilla [1]. Consequently, the Court granted the motion and amended its previous decision to sustain the lower court's order appointing Lopez [1]. This ruling remains effective pending the final determination of the main case (G.R. No. L-23225) or until a different set of circumstances justifies further action [1]. The decision is amended [1].
