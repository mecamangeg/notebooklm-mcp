I. CAPTION
ALFREDO V. CRUZ, JR. v. DOLORES H. SISON, G.R. No. L-15902, December 23, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alfredo V. Cruz, Jr. issued subpoenas to respondents Dolores H. Sison and Benjamin Ravanera (in the consolidated case G.R. No. L-15903) requiring them to testify in the criminal case of *People v. Secretary Jaime Hernandez* (Criminal Case No. 47152). At the time, the criminal case was already pending trial before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [1]. The respondents, who resided in Naga City, failed to appear. Consequently, Petitioner filed petitions for contempt against them in the CFI of Manila [2].

The CFI dismissed the petitions, ruling that the respondents were not bound by the processes because their residence in Naga City was more than 50 kilometers from Manila [2]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the 50-kilometer rule under the Rules of Court did not apply to criminal cases and that respondents should be held in contempt [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City Fiscal may directly file contempt charges against a witness who fails to obey a subpoena without a prior application to the court for enforcement.
2. W/N the City Fiscal has the authority to issue subpoenas for a case that has already been filed and is pending trial in court.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petitions for contempt were prematurely filed. Under the Revised Charter of the City of Manila (Republic Act No. 409, Sec. 38-B, as amended), while the Fiscal has the power to issue subpoenas, the attendance of an absent or recalcitrant witness can be enforced only by application to the proper Municipal Court or Court of First Instance [4, 5]. This procedure ensures the witness has the opportunity to question the validity, propriety, and reasonableness of the subpoena before the court, similar to a motion to quash a subpoena *duces tecum* [5, 6]. Contempt proceedings only lie if the witness fails to comply with a subsequent court order enforcing the subpoena [6].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the power of the City Fiscal to issue subpoenas extends only to cases pending investigation before him [1]. Once a complaint or information has been filed in court, as was the case here with Criminal Case No. 47152, the power to issue necessary processes belongs to the court, not the Fiscal [1].

The decision of the lower court is AFFIRMED [7].
