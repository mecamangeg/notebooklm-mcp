**I. CAPTION**
FELIZA JOVEN DE JESUS, duly assisted by her husband GREGORIO B. DE JESUS v. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, G.R. No. L-19299, November 28, 1964, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 6, 1961, the Court of First Instance of Pampanga rendered a decision ordering the Philippine National Bank (PNB) to pay Feliza Joven De Jesus the sum of P3,274.98 plus damages. PNB's postal clerk received the copy of the decision via registered mail on February 13, 1961. However, due to the volume of work and internal routing procedures, the document was delivered to and stamped by PNB's Legal Department only on February 15, 1961.

Relying on the February 15 date stamped by the Legal Department, PNB’s counsel calculated the 30-day appeal period and filed the Notice of Appeal on March 16, 1961, and the Record on Appeal on March 17, 1961. The trial court dismissed the appeal for being filed out of time, as the actual deadline based on the February 13 receipt was March 15, 1961. PNB filed a motion for relief citing "excusable negligence," arguing counsel relied in good faith on the stamp of the Legal Department. The trial court denied the motion.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the delay in perfecting the appeal due to counsel's reliance on the date stamped by the Legal Department receiving clerk, rather than the date of receipt from the post office, constitutes excusable negligence.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the appeal. The Court held that the delay was not due to excusable negligence because PNB's counsel "carelessly took for granted" that the date stamped by the Legal Department was the actual date of receipt from the post office [1]. Counsel knew or should have known PNB's system of handling correspondence, where mail passes through postal clerks before reaching specific departments, and thus the departmental receipt date could not be relied upon as the date of service [1]. Counsel could have easily verified the correct date with the postal clerk but failed to do so [2].

The Court reiterated that the right to appeal is merely a statutory privilege, and compliance with the 30-day period under Rule 41, Section 3 is indispensable for the prevention of delays [3]. Furthermore, the relaxation of rules "in the interest of justice" was not applicable because PNB failed to show prejudice; the lower court's judgment expressly provided for PNB's reimbursement by the third-party defendant, who did not appeal the decision [4].

Orders affirmed.
