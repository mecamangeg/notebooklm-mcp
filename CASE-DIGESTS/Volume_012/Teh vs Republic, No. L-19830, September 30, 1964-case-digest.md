I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF PAUL TEH TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. PAUL TEH v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19830, September 30, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Paul Teh, a Chinese citizen born in Manila, filed a petition for naturalization which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Manila. The Republic appealed the decision on three grounds, including the petitioner’s alleged lack of a lucrative trade (earning only P280.00 monthly) and the insufficiency of his vouching witnesses.

The petitioner presented two character witnesses: Ponciano Ogalesco, a bookkeeper in a Chinese firm, and Ricardo Alejandro, a Manila policeman. Ogalesco's testimony consisted primarily of conclusions in response to leading questions regarding Teh's moral character. Alejandro, on the other hand, had previously been charged with maintaining an opium den, though he was acquitted. During cross-examination, Alejandro admitted he could not state a single principle underlying the Philippine Constitution [1], [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the character witnesses presented by the petitioner were credible and sufficient to support the petition for naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court found the witnesses deficient. The Naturalization Law requires that an applicant be vouched for by two credible persons who act as "insurers" of the applicant's qualifications; therefore, the witnesses themselves must be individuals of probity and good standing in the community [3].

The Court held that Ogalesco's long employment as a bookkeeper in a Chinese firm was not necessarily satisfactory proof of his probity and good standing. Furthermore, his testimony was deemed deficient for failing to provide details of the petitioner's life to substantiate his endorsement. Regarding Alejandro, the Court ruled that his position as a policeman was insufficient proof of probity given his previous accusation for violating opium laws. Moreover, his own ignorance of the Philippine Constitution disqualified him from testifying as to whether the petitioner believed in its principles [3]. The Court did not find it necessary to rule on the income requirement as the witness issue was decisive.

The judgment appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the petition is **DENIED** [4].
