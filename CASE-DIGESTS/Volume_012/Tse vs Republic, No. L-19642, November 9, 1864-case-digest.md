I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. NILDA TSE @ NIL v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-19642, November 9, 1964, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Nilda Tse, born in 1935 to Chinese parents in Danao, Cebu, applied for naturalization [1]. She claimed to be employed as a purchasing agent for Evergreen Grocery, a store owned by her father in Maasin, Leyte, receiving a monthly salary of P120.00 plus bonuses and commissions for a total of P300.00 [2]. At the time of the hearing, specifically in June 1961, she was a fifth-year pharmacy student at the University of San Carlos in Cebu [1, 2]. To prove her good moral character, she presented two witnesses: Raymundo Gonzales, a customer of her father's store, and Vicente Kangleon, a neighbor [3].

The Court of First Instance of Southern Leyte granted the petition [1]. The Solicitor General appealed, contesting the lower court's finding that the petitioner possessed a lucrative trade or occupation [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the petitioner's witnesses were competent to vouch for her good moral character.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petitioner failed to prove she had a lucrative trade. First, a monthly salary of P120.00 is not considered lucrative [2]. The Court held that alleged bonuses and commissions cannot be taken into consideration in determining compliance with the requirement of a lucrative trade because they are, by their nature, indefinite and unsteady [2, 4]. Second, the Court found it "incredible" that the petitioner could be employed as a purchasing agent for a store in Leyte while simultaneously being a pharmacy student at a university in Cebu [2, 5]. Finally, there was no evidence, such as tax payments, to support her income claims other than her bare assertion [2].

2. **NO.** The character witnesses were insufficient. The Court ruled that a witness who is merely a customer or a neighbor who meets the applicant daily is not competent enough to vouch for good moral character if their knowledge amounts to a "mere nodding acquaintanceship" [5, 6]. Witnesses in naturalization proceedings must be able to vouch for the applicant's good moral character during the entire period of their residence, which the petitioner's witnesses failed to do [6].

The decision of the lower court granting the petition for naturalization is **REVERSED and SET ASIDE** [7].
