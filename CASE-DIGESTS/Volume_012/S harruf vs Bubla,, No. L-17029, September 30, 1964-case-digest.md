**I. CAPTION**
SAMUEL S. SHARRUF v. FRANK BUBLA and HON. ARSENIO SOLIDUM, G.R. No. L-17029, September 30, 1964, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Frank Bubla, a non-resident alien and manager of the "Bubla Continental Revue," filed a complaint against Samuel S. Sharruf for accounting regarding a theatrical contract. Sharruf filed an answer with a counterclaim, but his counsel later withdrew. Sharruf failed to appear during the pre-trial and subsequent scheduled trials despite notices sent to his address of record. Consequently, the trial court allowed Bubla to present evidence *ex parte* and rendered judgment in his favor, ordering Sharruf to render an accounting and pay damages.

Sharruf filed a Motion for New Trial alleging mistake and/or excusable negligence, which the trial court denied because it was not supported by an affidavit of merit. Sharruf then filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, arguing that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over Bubla (who had never entered the Philippines) and that the judgment was void for lack of notice of the trial.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the person of the plaintiff, a non-resident alien who never entered the Philippines.
2. W/N the denial of the Motion for New Trial was proper.
3. W/N the judgment is void for lack of notice to the petitioner.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that a court may acquire jurisdiction over the person of a party either by voluntary appearance or by service of summons. By filing his complaint in a Philippine court, Bubla, a non-resident alien, voluntarily submitted to its jurisdiction, acquiring such jurisdiction even if he had never been able to enter the country [1], [2].

2. **YES.** The granting or denial of a motion for new trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. The Court found no error in the denial because the motion was not supported by an affidavit of merit as required by the Rules of Court. Even considering the allegations in the answer, they did not satisfy the rule as to proof of mistake or excusable negligence [3], [4].

3. **NO.** The claim that the decision is void for lack of notice is untenable. The record showed that repeated notices of trial were sent to Sharruf's registered address of record. Furthermore, the trial court had even reset the trial date and directed Bubla's counsel to notify Sharruf, yet he still failed to appear [1], [5].

**Petition dismissed.**
