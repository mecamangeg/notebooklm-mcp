**I. CAPTION**
**MIGUEL R. SOCCO v. CONCHITA VDA. DE LEARY and THE COURT OF APPEALS**, G.R. No. L-19461, October 31, 1964, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Miguel Socco obtained a judgment in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against respondents Conchita Vda. de Leary and Carlos Barretto, ordering them to pay damages and deliver shares of Gold Star Mining Co., Inc. The Court of Appeals (CA) modified the judgment to include additional shares. After the judgment became final, the CFI issued an order of execution. Vda. de Leary delivered shares and paid damages, but Socco questioned Stock Certificate No. 220 covering 96,000 shares. The CFI rejected said certificate, finding the shares were registered to third persons, and ordered execution against the supersedeas bond for their value (P9,600.00).

Vda. de Leary received the order and immediately filed an urgent motion to substitute the rejected certificate with new ones. The CFI denied the motion "for lack of merit" and issued the writ of execution. Vda. de Leary filed a petition for certiorari with the CA, claiming the execution order varied the judgment terms. The CA granted the petition and set aside the CFI’s order. Socco appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the CA lacked jurisdiction because the order of execution was not appealable and the motion for substitution was defective.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari against an order of execution of a final judgment.
2. W/N the motion for substitution was fatally defective for lack of a three-day notice and specific hearing schedule.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** While the general rule is that no appeal is allowed from an order of execution of a final and executory judgment, an exception exists when the order of execution would substantially vary the terms of the judgment [1]. In this case, the CFI's rejection of the shares based on factual findings regarding their ownership presented a factual question that could be raised on appeal [1]. Since the appeal from such orders involved questions of fact and the amount was within the CA's range, the writ of certiorari was properly issued "in aid of its appellate jurisdiction" [2].

2. **NO.** The lack of a three-day notice and specific time and place of hearing was not a fatal defect considering the urgency of the matter [3]. The motion could be heard on shorter notice, and the notice asking for "immediate consideration" by the "Court of First Instance of Manila" substantially indicated the time and place of the hearing [3].

**Petition denied. Decision affirmed.**
