I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JOAQUIN DOCTOR y DIZON and CAPITAL INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-20150, September 30, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In a criminal case for serious physical injuries through reckless negligence against accused Joaquin Doctor in the Municipal Court of Manila, the accused failed to appear for arraignment on April 30, 1962, despite notice to his bondsman, appellant Capital Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. [1]. Consequently, on May 10, 1962, the Municipal Court issued an order forfeiting the P1,000 bond and granting the bondsman 30 days to produce the accused and show cause why judgment should not be rendered for the amount of the bond [1]. On May 21, 1962, the bondsman surrendered the accused and moved to lift the order of confiscation, claiming it received notice only three days prior to the hearing [1]. The Municipal Court denied the motion and the subsequent motion for reconsideration [1]. The bondsman appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, which dismissed the appeal on July 3, 1962, ruling it was premature as no judgment had yet been rendered on the bond [1]. The bondsman appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the Municipal Court's orders were tantamount to a judgment against the bond [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal from the Municipal Court's order of forfeiture was premature.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the appeal was premature [2, 3]. The order appealed from merely required the appellant "to show cause why judgment should not be rendered against it for the amount of the bond" [2]. At that stage, there was "as yet no such judgment against appellant nor has the amount for which appellant shall be held liable been fixed" [2]. The Court ruled that the orders were obviously interlocutory in nature and cannot be appealed before the rendition of the final judgment [3].

The appealed orders of the Court of First Instance of Manila are affirmed [3].
