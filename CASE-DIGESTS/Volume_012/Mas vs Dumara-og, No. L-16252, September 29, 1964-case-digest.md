**I. CAPTION**
ROSARIO MAS v. ELISA DUMARA-OG and BENIGNO ABALAJON, G.R. No. L-16252, September 29, 1964, Bengzon, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 26, 1957, respondents Dumara-og and Abalajon filed a collection suit (Civil Case No. 4284) against petitioner Mas in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo [1]. A decision was rendered in favor of the respondents based on a confession of judgment signed by Mas. The judgment became final, and Mas’ properties in Antique were levied and sold to the respondents in a public auction [1]. On March 7, 1959, Mas filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 102) in the CFI of Antique to annul the judgment of the CFI of Iloilo, alleging that the confession of judgment was obtained through deceit and misrepresentation [2]. The CFI of Antique dismissed the complaint, ruling it had no jurisdiction to annul the judgment of another court of concurrent jurisdiction [2]. Mas appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance of Antique has jurisdiction to annul a judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance of Iloilo.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the power to open, modify, or vacate a judgment is restricted to the court in which the judgment was rendered [3]. It is an elementary principle of justice that the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction may not be opened, modified, or vacated by any court of concurrent jurisdiction [3]. While the petitioner argued that the case involves title to land in Antique and should be venued there, the Court ruled that the action to recover the property cannot prosper unless the Iloilo court's decision is first annulled, a remedy that must be sought in Iloilo [4, 5].

The order appealed from is affirmed [5].
