I. CAPTION
CELEDONIA O. VDA. DE ACOSTA, et al. v. THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and THE MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-19772, October 21, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Bernardo Acosta worked as a switchman for respondent Manila Railroad Company for over 20 years. Medical exams from 1947 to 1953 showed he had normal lungs [1]. In 1956, he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) [1]. Despite his illness, he continued working until January 1960. He retired in May 1960 and died of the disease in June 1960 [2]. His duties involved waking up between 3:00 to 4:00 AM, exposure to elements (dust, rain, cold), and physical labor such as loading cargoes due to a lack of porters [3, 4].

Petitioners (his heirs) filed a claim for compensation. The Hearing Officer ruled in their favor, finding the illness was contracted during employment [5, 6]. However, the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed this decision, ruling that the claimants failed to prove the factors causing the illness [7]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the deceased's illness and death are compensable under the Workmen’s Compensation Act.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the WCC decision and reinstated the Hearing Officer's award.

The Court held that once it is established that the employee’s death was due to a disease contracted in the course of his employment, the presumption is that the nature thereof is the cause of said disease, and the burden is upon the employer to prove the contrary [7]. Since Acosta was healthy before employment and contracted PTB during his service, the burden shifted to the employer to show that the illness was due to causes other than work, such as dissipation or excesses (*Blue Bar Coconut Co., et al. v. Boo*) [8]. The respondent Company failed to overcome this presumption, and evidence showed Acosta's work conditions (early hours, exposure, physical exertion) supported the claim [9].

The petition was granted, and the respondent Manila Railroad Company was ordered to pay the compensation benefits awarded by the Hearing Officer [9].
