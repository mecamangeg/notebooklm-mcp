I. CAPTION
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. UNION DE MAQUINISTAS, FOGONEROS Y MOTORMEN, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-18444–45, November 28, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On January 9, 1951, the Board of Directors of Manila Railroad Company (MRR) passed Resolution No. 437, implementing a graduated temporary reduction of employee salaries (5% to 20%) effective January 1, 1951 [1]. The resolution stated that the amounts would be "returned immediately as the finances of [MRR] improve" [1]-[2]. As finances improved, MRR gradually restored the original salary rates, fully restoring them by July 1, 1954 [2].

On April 30, 1960, the respondent Unions filed a petition in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) as an incident to two pending certified cases (Nos. 17-IPA and 18-IPA), seeking a refund of the deductions made under the resolution [3]. MRR moved to dismiss, arguing lack of jurisdiction because the refund claim was not an "unsettled demand" when the President certified the main cases to the CIR [3]. The CIR denied the motion and ordered the computation of the deductions to determine if the company's finances warranted payment [4]. MRR appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR has jurisdiction over the claim for refund as an incident to the certified cases.
2. W/N the employees are entitled to a refund of the salary deductions based on the resolution.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The claim for refund is necessarily connected with the main case and may be treated as an incident therein [5]-[6]. The record shows that the refund of deductions was one of the specific demands embodied in a letter by the Union de Empleados de Trenes prior to the certification [5]. Furthermore, the non-payment of these amounts was one of the motivating factors that led the unions to declare the strike which resulted in the President certifying the dispute to the CIR [5].

2. **YES.** The language of the resolution ("returned immediately") is ambiguous, requiring resort to contemporaneous circumstances to determine the parties' intent [7]. The Court noted that MRR's General Manager had orally pledged to refund the deductions, and that similar allowances (P30.00 monthly) deducted under a different resolution had already been refunded [8]-[9]. Since the Board of Directors drafted the resolution, any doubt must be resolved against it and in favor of the employees [9]. This is consistent with Article 1702 of the Civil Code, which mandates that in case of doubt, labor legislation and contracts shall be construed in favor of the safety and decent living of the laborer [10].

The order of the Court of Industrial Relations is **AFFIRMED** [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
