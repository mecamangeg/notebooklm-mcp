I. CAPTION
EUSEBIO M. LOPEZ, ET AL. v. HON. CARMELINO G. ALVENDIA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20697, December 24, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents David and Adelaida Minsberg purchased a lot from petitioners but failed to receive the title despite full payment. They filed a complaint in the CFI of Manila. The parties entered into a compromise agreement, which became the basis of the decision dated August 24, 1962. The judgment ordered petitioners to deliver the certificate of title and pay P3,500.00 in damages not later than September 21, 1962. It further provided that failure to comply would automatically increase the damages to P10,000.00 and trigger the immediate issuance of a writ of execution.

On the September 21 deadline, petitioner Eusebio Lopez, Jr. issued a check for the damages, but it was dishonored by the bank. Petitioners later deposited the cash amount and moved to lift the execution, arguing the dishonor was due to an "honest mistake" or "oversight" by the bank. Respondent Judge Alvendia denied the motion and ordered execution for P10,000.00, ruling that the check was not legal tender and the alleged bank oversight was immaterial. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, mandamus, and prohibition.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in ordering the execution of the judgment for the increased amount of P10,000.00.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, finding no grave abuse of discretion. The Court reasoned that time was of the essence in the compromise judgment, and petitioners failed to comply by the deadline. The Court rejected the defense of "bank oversight," holding that the bank acted as the petitioners' agent; thus, the principal is responsible for the agent's acts done within the scope of authority [1]. Furthermore, under Article 1249 of the Civil Code, a check is not legal tender and produces the effect of payment only when cashed [2]. Therefore, the trial court correctly refused to hear evidence regarding the sufficiency of funds, as it was immaterial to the legal tender issue. Finally, the Court noted that mere errors of judgment or law are proper subjects of appeal, not certiorari [1].

The petition is dismissed.
