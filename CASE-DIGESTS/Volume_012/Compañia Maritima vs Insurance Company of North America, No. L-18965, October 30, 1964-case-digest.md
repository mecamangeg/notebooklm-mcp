I. CAPTION
COMPAÑIA MARITIMA, petitioner, vs. INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA, respondent., G.R. No. L-18965, October 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
In October 1952, Macleod and Company contracted Compañia Maritima (petitioner) to ship 2,645 bales of hemp from Davao to Manila for transshipment to Boston [1]. The petitioner sent its lighters, LCT Nos. 1023 and 1025, to Macleod’s private wharf, where loading was completed on October 29, 1952 [1]. The patron of LCT No. 1025 issued a receipt "in behalf of S.S. Bowline Knot" acknowledging the cargo in good order [2]. The lighters then moved to the government marginal wharf to await the S.S. Bowline Knot. During the night, LCT No. 1025 sank, damaging 1,162 bales of hemp [2].

Macleod was insured by the Insurance Company of North America (respondent), which paid the claim of P64,018.55 and was subrogated to Macleod’s rights [3]. Respondent sued the petitioner for P60,421.02 [3]. The petitioner argued there was no contract of carriage as the goods were not loaded on the S.S. Bowline Knot and no bill of lading was issued, and claimed force majeure due to a storm [4]. The trial court ruled in favor of the respondent, and the Court of Appeals affirmed [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N there was a perfected contract of carriage even if the cargo was not actually loaded on the main vessel and no bill of lading was issued.
2. W/N the carrier is exempt from liability due to force majeure.
3. W/N the insurer has standing to sue the carrier as an assignee of the shipper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that a complete contract of carriage existed, the consummation of which had already begun [6]. When the shipper delivered the cargo to the carrier’s lighter, and the carrier’s authorized employees took possession, the rights and obligations of the parties attached [6]. The lighters were substitutes for the vessel, and delivery to them constituted delivery to the carrier [7]. Furthermore, the Court ruled that a bill of lading is not indispensable for the creation of a contract of carriage [8]. Citing Article 350 of the Code of Commerce, the Court noted that the bill of lading is merely documentary proof of stipulations, not an essential requisite for the contract's existence [9].

2. **NO.** The Court rejected the defense of force majeure [10]. The evidence showed winds of only 11 miles per hour, which does not constitute a storm under Beaufort’s wind scale (64-75 mph) or Philippine Weather Bureau standards (55-74 mph) [10]. The loss was attributed to the carrier's lack of adequate precautions and the unseaworthiness of the barge, which had cracks on its bottom [10, 11].

3. **YES.** The insurance company can sue the carrier as the assignee/subrogee of the shipper [12]. Having paid the loss, the insurer stepped into the shoes of the shipper [12]. The carrier cannot set up defects in the insurance policy as a defense because it is not a privy to the insurance contract and cannot avoid its liability to the shipper [12].

The petition is DENIED, and the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED.
