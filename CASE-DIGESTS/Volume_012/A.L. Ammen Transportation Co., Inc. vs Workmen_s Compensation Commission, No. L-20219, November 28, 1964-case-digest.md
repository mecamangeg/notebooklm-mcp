I. CAPTION
A.L. AMMEN TRANSPORTATION CO., INC. v. THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20219, November 28, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner A.L. Ammen Transportation Co. filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court regarding a decision by the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) involving the widow and children of the late Agripino Jacob [1]. The Supreme Court initially rendered a decision on September 28, 1964 [1]. However, respondents moved to set aside this decision and dismiss the petition, arguing that the petitioner failed to perfect its appeal [1]. While the petitioner filed the petition for review with the Court within the reglementary period, it failed to file a notice of appeal with the WCC [2]. The petitioner failed to comment on the respondents' claim when required by the Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court acquired jurisdiction over the appeal despite the petitioner's failure to file a notice of appeal with the Workmen’s Compensation Commission.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court set aside its previous decision and dismissed the petition [3]. Under Section 1, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, an appeal from the Workmen's Compensation Commission is perfected by filing a notice of appeal with the Commission *and* a petition with the Supreme Court within the prescribed period [4, 5]. The filing of a notice of appeal with the Commission is a mandatory requirement [5]. The failure to file said notice is fatal to the action and prevents the Supreme Court from acquiring jurisdiction over the case (*Martha Lumber Mill, Inc. v. Lagradante*; *Heirs of Patricio Pabores v. The Commissioner*) [2, 6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Paredes, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, and Zaldivar, JJ., concurred [3].
