I. CAPTION
WEST LEYTE TRANSPORTATION CO., INC. v. ADELAIDO SALAZAR, G.R. No. L-15418, September 30, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Adelaido Salazar, a holder of a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) operating four auto-trucks on the Maasin-Baybay line, filed an application with the Public Service Commission (PSC) to increase his equipment by six units and extend his line to Tacloban City [1]. Petitioner West Leyte Transportation Co., Inc. opposed the application, claiming that public convenience did not require the additional service, existing operators were sufficient, and granting the application would cause ruinous competition [2]. Petitioner presented certifications of the 2% carrier’s tax paid by operators to argue that low passenger volume caused business losses [3].

Respondent presented evidence, including testimony from municipal officials and residents, as well as municipal council resolutions, attesting to the heavy volume of passengers (government employees and merchants) and the insufficiency of existing transportation on the proposed route [4], [5]. The PSC granted the application in part, authorizing the extension to Tacloban and the addition of two units, finding sufficient passenger traffic and ruling that the petitioner's tax evidence was inconclusive [6], [7]. Petitioner appealed the decision.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission erred in finding that public necessity and convenience justified the extension of the respondent's line and the increase of his units.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Public Service Commission's decision. The Court reiterated the long-standing policy that it will not interfere with the findings of the Commission regarding the necessity and convenience of a public utility when such findings are reasonably supported by evidence (*A.L. Ammen Transportation Co., Inc. v. Desuyo*; *Raymund Transportation Co. v. Cervo*) [8], [9].

The Court found that the PSC's decision was supported by substantial evidence, including testimonies and resolutions from affected municipalities proving the need for additional service [9], [10]. The Commission correctly disregarded the petitioner's evidence regarding the 2% carrier's tax as mere conjecture, noting that tax payments alone could not determine the number of buses operated or the volume of passengers on specific lines [7]. Factual findings of the Commission, being supported by sufficient evidence, must not be disturbed [11].

The petition is dismissed, with costs against the petitioner.
