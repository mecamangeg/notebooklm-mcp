I. CAPTION
PEOPLE’S HOMESITE & HOUSING CORPORATION v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and ESTRELLA ALBA TITONG, G.R. No. L-18246, October 30, 1964.

II. FACTS
Titong was employed as a checker by petitioner People’s Homesite & Housing Corporation (PHHC) [1]. On July 10, 1956, while checking the loading of cement on the employer's premises, Titong and a co-worker, Federico Magalang, engaged in a heated argument and fistfight [1]. Titong fell, his head hitting a hollow block, which led to his hospitalization and eventual death on August 25, 1956 due to brain abscess [1]. PHHC alleged the fight was caused by a practical joke Titong played on Magalang [2].

Titong's widow filed a claim for compensation. PHHC denied the claim, arguing: (1) it was barred by prescription as it was filed beyond the statutory 3-month period, and (2) the death was due to Titong's "notorious negligence" (the practical joke/fight) and did not arise out of employment [3]. The Hearing Officer ruled in favor of the widow, and the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed the decision [2]. PHHC appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the employee's death, resulting from a fistfight originated by a practical joke, is compensable as arising out of and in the course of employment.
2. W/N the claim is barred by prescription due to the failure to file within the statutory period.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The death is compensable. The Court held that a practical joke that leads to an assault by a co-worker does not constitute "gross negligence" sufficient to bar compensation [4, 5]. Since the injury occurred within the employer's premises while the employee was fulfilling his duties as a checker, it arose in the course of employment [6, 7]. The Court relied on *La Mallorca Taxi vs. Guanlao*, which established that an employee's joke offending a co-worker is not gross negligence [5]. Additionally, citing *Batangas Transportation vs. Vda. de Javier*, the Court noted the legal presumption that a death occurring in the course of employment is compensable absent substantial evidence to the contrary [7].

2. **NO.** The defense of prescription is waived. The Court found that PHHC failed to submit the required Employer’s Report of Accident, despite its plant superintendent knowing of the injury on the day it happened [8]. Under Section 25 of Act 3428 and the doctrine in *Martha Lumber Mill, Inc. vs. Lagradante*, an employer's failure to submit the required report constitutes a waiver of the defense that the claim was not filed within the statutory period [8, 9].

The appealed judgment is AFFIRMED, with costs [10].
