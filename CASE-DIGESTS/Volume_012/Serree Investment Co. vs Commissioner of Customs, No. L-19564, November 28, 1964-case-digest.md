I. CAPTION
SERREE INVESTMENT COMPANY v. COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-19564, November 28, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Serree Investment Company was the consignee of shipments of fresh potatoes and garlic from Hong Kong which arrived in Manila in 1954 and 1955 [1, 2]. The shipments were seized by the Bureau of Customs because they lacked the required Central Bank Release Certificates, in violation of Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 in relation to the Revised Administrative Code [2]. The Collector of Customs ordered the forfeiture of the goods [3]. Petitioner was allowed to redeem the shipments under protest but subsequently challenged the validity of the forfeiture proceedings [3, 4]. The Collector denied the protest, and the Commissioner of Customs sustained the Collector's ruling [4]. On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the validity of the forfeiture [1, 4]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Central Bank lacked the power to regulate these importations and that Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 were void regarding said merchandise [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the forfeiture of the imported goods for lack of Central Bank Release Certificates required by Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 is valid.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals. The Court reiterated its previous ruling involving the same petitioner (*Commissioner of Customs vs. Serree Investment Company*, L-12007) that even if importations do not legally require an immediate sale of foreign exchange ("no-dollar" imports), they inevitably create a future demand for it [5, 6]. Therefore, Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 are valid measures authorized by Section 74 of Republic Act No. 265 to protect the international reserve and check the unregulated flow of foreign exchange [7].

Since the importations were made without the necessary import license (Circular No. 45) and release certificates (Circular No. 44), they constitute "merchandise of prohibited importation" or merchandise the importation of which is effected "contrary to law." Consequently, they are subject to forfeiture under Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code [8].

The petition was denied and the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals was affirmed [9, 10].
