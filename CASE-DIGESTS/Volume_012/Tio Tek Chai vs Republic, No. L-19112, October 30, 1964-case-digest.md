I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF TIO TEK CHAI alias SO LIM TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. TIO TEK CHAI alias SO LIM v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19112, October 30, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tio Tek Chai, a Chinese national residing in Manila, filed a petition for naturalization which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Manila. The Republic appealed the decision, highlighting that in 1956, the petitioner was convicted of violating the Price Tag Law (Republic Act No. 71). He had pleaded guilty to the charge and paid a fine of P10.00. The petitioner argued that the offense did not involve moral turpitude and explained that he only pleaded guilty to avoid the inconvenience of a trial after his storekeeper failed to replace a missing price tag.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's violation of the Price Tag Law disqualifies him from becoming a Filipino citizen.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the question of whether the offense involves moral turpitude is not decisive. Under the Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473), it is not enough that an applicant is not disqualified under Section 4; they must also possess the qualifications in Section 2, specifically the requirement to conduct oneself in a "proper and irreproachable manner" during the entire period of residence in the Philippines.

The violation of the Price Tag Law (R.A. 71), a law enacted to protect the buying public from profiteering, renders the petitioner's conduct "anything but proper and irreproachable." Additionally, the Court noted that in naturalization appeals, the entire record is open for consideration (*Kwan Kwock How v. Republic*). The record revealed the petitioner had insufficient income and previous fines for violating sanitation and construction ordinances, further justifying the refusal of citizenship.

The judgment appealed from is reversed, and the petition is denied.
