I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF YAP BUN PIN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, YAP BUN PIN alias VICENTE YAP v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19577, October 30, 1964, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner-appellee Yap Bun Pin, a resident of Gumaca, Quezon since 1941, filed a petition for naturalization [1, 2]. He works as a copra dealer and is married with five children, all of whom are of school age [2]. At the trial, he presented his 1960 income tax return showing a net income of P4,485.27 [3]. The Court of First Instance of Quezon granted his petition [1]. The Republic appealed, objecting primarily on the ground that the petitioner did not have a lucrative occupation [1]. On appeal, the petitioner attached his 1961 and 1962 income tax returns to his brief and manifestation to show increased income, including alleged commissions and farming income derived from his mother’s properties [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner’s income is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of a lucrative occupation.
2. W/N the 1961 and 1962 income tax returns presented for the first time on appeal may be considered.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that a net income of P4,485.27 (for 1960) is "obviously inadequate" to support a wife and five children, even considering the lower cost of living in the province [3]. The Court applied the standard set in *Keng Giok v. Republic*, where an annual income of P8,687.50 was deemed insufficient for an applicant with a wife and five children due to the high cost of living [6-8]. Other precedents like *Koa Gui v. Republic* (P5,980.00 income with wife and three children) were also cited to show the insufficiency of the petitioner's financial capacity [7].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the 1961 and 1962 income tax returns cannot be considered because they were not presented during the trial [4]. Under settled rules, new evidence cannot be considered on appeal; the decision must rely solely on evidence produced in the court below [9]. Furthermore, the Court observed indicia that the earnings in these later returns were "padded," specifically noting that income claimed from farming and administration commissions involving his mother's land was unwarranted since he was not the owner [4, 5].

The judgment appealed from is REVERSED and the application for naturalization is DENIED [10].
