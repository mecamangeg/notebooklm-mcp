I. CAPTION
EUGENIO LOPEZ, SR., EUGENIO LOPEZ, JR. and CHRONICLE PUBLICATIONS v. CHRONICLE PUBLICATIONS EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION, PHILIPPINE NEWSPAPER WORKERS GUILD, ORLANDO AQUINO, CARMELITO VICENTE, JOSE GABOR, ARNALDO MOSS, JR. and LETTY DE LA RAMA-ECHAUS, G.R. Nos. L-20179–81, December 28, 1964, 12 SCRA 694, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Orlando Aquino, Carmelito Vicente, and others organized the Chronicle Publications Employees Association (the Union) in June 1958. They were assisted by Virgilio F. Reyes, who was then a supervisor (News Editor) at the Manila Chronicle. Following the union's formation, petitioners (the employers) denied the respondent employees the traditional Christmas bonuses for 1958 and 1959 and a general salary increase in April 1959. Petitioners argued the union was illegal because a supervisor assisted in its organization, violating Republic Act No. 875.

Subsequently, in September 1960, respondents Aquino and Vicente were dismissed from employment after publishing an article in the union newspaper, "The Newsman," titled "Political Pressure?". The article accused the employer of exerting political pressure on the City Fiscal to thwart the employees' legitimate activities. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found petitioners guilty of Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) for the discrimination regarding benefits and the dismissal of Aquino and Vicente. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent union is illegal because a supervisor participated in its organization.
2. W/N the dismissal of employees for publishing an article accusing the employer of political pressure is valid.
3. W/N petitioners Eugenio Lopez, Sr. and Jr. are liable in ULP cases where they were not made parties.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The invalidity of the membership of a supervisor in a labor union does not make the union itself illegal. Section 3 of Republic Act No. 875 renders supervisors ineligible for membership in a labor organization of employees under their supervision, but it does not declare the union void if this prohibition is violated. The law's silence implies that the effect is confined to the nullity of the supervisor's membership. The union remains valid if other legal requirements are met. Furthermore, rank-and-file employees are not considered "disloyal" for organizing with a supervisor. Thus, the denial of bonuses and salary increases based on this ground constituted unfair labor practice.

2. **YES.** The dismissal was valid. The act of an employee in publishing a "suspicion" in a union newspaper that the employer is exerting political pressure on a public official—essentially accusing the employer of a crime—sullys the employer's reputation and is an act inimical to the employer's interest. The fact that the publication was a union activity does not shield the employees from liability for improper conduct. Such an act constitutes misconduct and is a just cause for dismissal.

3. **NO.** Petitioners Eugenio Lopez, Sr. and Eugenio Lopez, Jr. cannot be held liable for unfair labor practices in cases where they were not impleaded as parties. Although the cases were tried jointly, liability in the cases where only "Chronicle Publications, Inc." was the respondent is confined to the corporation.

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed with modification. The dismissal of Aquino and Vicente is declared valid (reversing the CIR's ULP finding on this specific point), while the finding of ULP regarding the withholding of benefits is affirmed. The Lopezes are absolved from liability in the cases where they were not parties.
