I. CAPTION
ROSARIO CRUZ v. ATTY. EDMUNDO CABAL and ATTY. MANUEL CALUPITAN, Adm. Case No. 482, October 31, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Rosario Cruz won a workmen's compensation award against her husband's employer, Royal Theater. The employer filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, challenging the jurisdiction of the Department of Labor's Regional Office. Respondents Cabal and Calupitan, legal officers of the Regional Office, represented the government defendants as part of their official duties.

The CFI rendered a decision declaring the Regional Office without authority to try the claim. Respondent Calupitan received the decision and passed it to Respondent Cabal, who misplaced it. Cabal found the decision 19 days after the period to appeal had expired. He immediately filed a motion for extension of time to appeal, which the CFI granted. However, the Solicitor General refused to pursue the appeal due to the expiration of the period. Respondents personally filed the notice of appeal, but the Supreme Court eventually dismissed the appeal because Cruz failed to pay the docket fee on time. Cruz filed this administrative complaint charging respondents with gross negligence.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondents are administratively liable for gross negligence as members of the Bar.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Court ruled that the negligence of the respondents did not warrant disciplinary action.

First, the dismissal of the appeal was proximately caused by the complainant's failure to pay the docket fee, not the respondents' prior delay. Regarding the delay in the lower court, the Court held that the late motion for extension was in the nature of a petition for relief under Rule 38. The lack of verification in said motion was offset by the adverse counsel's lack of objection, and the absence of an affidavit of merits was not fatal because the issue raised—the constitutionality of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A—was a pure question of law [1, 2].

Second, the Court established that the respondents were government lawyers performing their official duties. Their relationship with Cruz was not that of a private attorney and client; they represented the case because it was their official duty to do so. Consequently, their negligence constituted a violation of their official duties rather than a breach of their duties as members of the Bar [3].

Complaint dismissed.
