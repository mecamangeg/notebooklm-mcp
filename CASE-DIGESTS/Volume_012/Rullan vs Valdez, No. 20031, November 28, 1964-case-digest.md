I. CAPTION
MAGDALENA RULLAN, ET AL. v. BERNARDO O. VALDEZ, G.R. No. 20031, November 28, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On November 24, 1961, respondent Bernardo O. Valdez filed an application with the Bureau of Mines for the lease of the Silica and Selecta placer mining claims [1]. During the publication period, petitioners Magdalena Rullan and George Alabanza filed an adverse claim, alleging that they were members of the Baguio-Loakan Placer Mining Association and that Valdez had rightfully reduced the Silica claim's area to enlarge his Selecta claim without their consent [1, 2].

On January 10, 1962, while the adverse claim was pending with the Bureau, petitioners filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Baguio to determine their rights as co-lessees [2]. Valdez moved to dismiss, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction because the Director of Mines had not yet acted on the adverse claim [3]. The CFI dismissed the complaint on the ground that the petitioners failed to exhaust administrative remedies [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court has jurisdiction to hear the adverse claim despite the petitioners' alleged failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal, ruling that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply [4]. Under **Section 73 of Commonwealth Act No. 137, as amended by Republic Act No. 746**, an adverse claimant is required to file their claim with the Director of Mines and, within 30 days thereafter, commence proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to settle the controversy [5]. The law explicitly mandates that upon the filing of an adverse claim, all administrative proceedings (except publication) are stayed until the controversy is decided by the court [5]. Thus, the Bureau of Mines' functions are suspended to await the court's action, and the court must determine the question of ownership before the administrative application can proceed [6, 7].

The order of dismissal was set aside, and the case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [4].
