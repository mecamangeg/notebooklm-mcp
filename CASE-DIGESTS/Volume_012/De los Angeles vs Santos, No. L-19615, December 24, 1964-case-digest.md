I. CAPTION
**DE LOS ANGELES v. SANTOS**, G.R. No. L-19615, December 24, 1964, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On November 21, 1959, petitioners Leonor de los Angeles and her co-applicants filed an application for registration of title to 12 parcels of land in Ampid, San Mateo, Rizal, alleging they were owners in fee simple [1]. The Director of Lands opposed, claiming the land was public domain, while private oppositors claimed ownership via homestead patents [1, 2].

During the pendency of the proceedings, the Land Registration Commissioner filed a report on July 25, 1961, stating that Lot 11 of the application had been patented to oppositor Julio Hidalgo on June 12, 1961 [3]. Consequently, the Court of First Instance dismissed the application with respect to Lot 11 "without prejudice," effectively ruling that the administrative issuance of the patent divested the court of jurisdiction [4, 5]. The applicants appealed, arguing the lower court erred in dismissing the case based on a patent issued during the proceedings [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a land registration court is divested of jurisdiction by the subsequent administrative issuance of a homestead patent over the land subject of the registration proceedings.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal and remanded the case. The Court held that a land registration court which has validly acquired jurisdiction over a parcel of land cannot be divested of said jurisdiction by a subsequent administrative act, such as the issuance of a homestead patent by the Director of Lands [6, 7].

The jurisdiction of the Director of Lands extends only to lands of the public domain, not to lands of private ownership [5]. Since the applicants alleged they were owners in fee simple at the time of application (November 1959), they must be given the opportunity to prove their registrable title [8]. If they succeed, it would establish that the land was no longer public when the patent was issued to Hidalgo in 1961, rendering the patent a nullity [8]. Furthermore, land registration proceedings are *in rem*, while homestead patent proceedings are not; thus, a patent does not finally dispose of the character of the land as far as courts in *in rem* proceedings are concerned [9].

**Orders set aside and case remanded to court *a quo* for further proceedings.**
