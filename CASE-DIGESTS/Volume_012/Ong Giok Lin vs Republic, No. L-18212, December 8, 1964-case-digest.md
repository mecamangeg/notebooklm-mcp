**I. CAPTION**
*In the Matter of the Petition of Ong Giok Lin alias Benjamin Ong to become a Filipino Citizen. Ong Giok Lin alias Benjamin Ong v. Republic of the Philippines*, G.R. No. L-18212, December 8, 1964, J.B.L. Reyes, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Ong Giok Lin (also known as Benjamin Ong), the manager of his mother-in-law’s lumber business, filed a petition for naturalization which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Leyte [1]. The Republic appealed the decision based on the testimony of Dr. Hermenegildo Serafica and his employee, Flaviano Cabaña [2]. The evidence showed that Ong approached Cabaña regarding a large lumber requisition by the Ormoc City government and proposed that they agree on a price higher than usual to split a profit of eight centavos per board foot [2]. Although Ong denied this and claimed it was Serafica who asked him to abstain from the bidding, Ong admitted that he did not reject the dishonest proposal outright and was absent during the bidding, allowing Serafica to win [3], [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner failed to prove that he possesses the morally irreproachable conduct required for naturalization.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner's moral character and conduct were far from irreproachable as required by the Naturalization Law [3]. The evidence established that the petitioner made proposals not averse to maneuvers that restrict free business competition to the detriment of the general interest, specifically regarding public biddings for the supply of lumber [5], [3]. Even if the petitioner’s version of events were accepted—that he was asked to abstain from bidding—his failure to outright reject the dishonest proposal and his subsequent absence from the bidding indicated he was not averse to taking part in such agreements [3].

Consequently, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the petition for naturalization is **DISMISSED** [4].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., and Zaldivar concurred [6].
