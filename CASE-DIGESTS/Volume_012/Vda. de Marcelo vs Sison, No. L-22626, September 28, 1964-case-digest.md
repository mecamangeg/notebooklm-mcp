**I. CAPTION**
ALICE FOLEY VDA. DE MARCELO, ET AL. v. HON. JUDGE RAFAEL S. SISON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22626, September 28, 1964, J.B.L. Reyes, J. [1]

**II. FACTS**
The Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur, presided by respondent Judge Sison, rendered judgment on the pleadings dismissing the petitioners' complaint and ordering them to pay P6,500.00 in damages [1, 2]. Petitioners appealed and tendered a record on appeal, which private respondents objected to because the caption failed to specify the full names of all parties and lacked a subject index, despite the record exceeding 70 pages [2]. Although the trial court granted three extensions to amend the record, the petitioners failed to cure these defects in their re-amended submissions [3]. Consequently, the trial court rejected the record on appeal and refused to certify it [3]. Petitioners filed a petition for Mandamus to compel the approval of the record [1, 3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the trial court correctly rejected the record on appeal for failure to include full names in the caption and a subject index. [3, 4]

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court found no merit in the application and upheld the lower court's refusal to approve the record. The admitted deficiencies—specifically the failure to state the full names of the parties in the caption and the absence of a subject index in a record exceeding 20 pages—constitute a clear violation of **Section 6, Rule 41 of the Revised Rules of Court** [3, 4]. This rule explicitly mandates that full names be stated in the caption and that any record on appeal exceeding 20 pages must contain a subject index [4].

The Court rejected the petitioners' argument that the respondents waived their objection by failing to reiterate it within the 10-day period prescribed by Section 7 of Rule 41 [4]. The Court ruled that, regardless of any waiver by the parties, the trial court has the right to act *motu proprio* to refuse approval of a record on appeal that does not conform to the Rules of Court [4].

The Writ of Mandamus is DENIED, with costs against petitioners [5].
