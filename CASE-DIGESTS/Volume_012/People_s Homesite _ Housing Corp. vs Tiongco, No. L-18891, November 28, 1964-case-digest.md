I. CAPTION
PEOPLE’S HOMESITE & HOUSING CORPORATION v. MELCHOR TIONGCO and MELCHOR ESCASA, G.R. No. L-18891, November 28, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Appellants Tiongco and Escasa were registered bonafide squatters on a lot in Quezon City since 1947. Despite their application to purchase the lot, the People’s Homesite & Housing Corporation (PHHC) awarded it to another person. PHHC subsequently filed an action for Recovery of Possession against appellants. Their counsel, Atty. Bonifacio Tañega, failed to notify them of the scheduled hearing, resulting in a judgment against them rendered in their absence. Atty. Tañega received the decision on March 7, 1961, but failed to inform the appellants or take any steps to protect their interests. Appellants only learned of the adverse decision when served with a writ of execution. They engaged new counsel and filed a Petition for Relief from Judgment on May 9, 1961. The trial court denied the petition, ruling that it was filed beyond the reglementary period of 60 days, counting from the date the former counsel received the decision, applying the doctrine that notice to counsel is notice to the client.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for relief from judgment should be considered seasonably filed despite the lapse of the 60-day period counted from notice to the former counsel.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while the petition was presented outside the reglementary period of 60 days from the former counsel's receipt of the judgment, it was considered seasonably filed due to the "very peculiar circumstances" of the case [1]. The Court ruled that procedural technicalities should not bar the vindication of a legitimate grievance [1]. The former counsel's conduct was deemed "fishy and suspicious" for ignoring court processes under the "lame and flimsy explanation" that they escaped his attention, thereby depriving the appellants of their day in court [2].

The Court declared that while notice to counsel is normally notice to the client, this doctrine should not apply when an irresponsible lawyer essentially sells his client's rights "down the river" [3]. Furthermore, the petition may be considered as one for relief from the *order of execution*, which was filed within the reglementary period, as Section 2 of Rule 38 of the Revised Rules of Court covers orders and other proceedings [4].

The Order of the lower court was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the court of origin for further proceedings [5].
