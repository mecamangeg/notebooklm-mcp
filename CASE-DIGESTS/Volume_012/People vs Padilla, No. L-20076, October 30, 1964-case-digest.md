I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MAGDALENA PADILLA and RIZAL SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY, G.R. No. L-20076, October 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Magdalena Padilla was charged with violating Article 183 of the Revised Penal Code. When she failed to appear for trial on July 12, 1957, the Court of First Instance of Manila ordered her arrest and the confiscation of her bond posted by Rizal Surety & Insurance Company (Rizal Surety) [1]. The court gave Rizal Surety 30 days to explain why the bond should not be forfeited [1]. On March 24, 1958, noting that over eight months had elapsed without the accused being surrendered, the court ordered the surety to pay the P1,000.00 bond [2]. Rizal Surety moved to lift the order, claiming the accused was apprehended by its agents about a week after the judgment of forfeiture was rendered [3]. The trial court denied the motion, and the surety appealed [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the forfeiture of the bail bond was proper despite the subsequent surrender of the accused.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Under Section 15, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court, when a defendant fails to appear, the surety must do two things within the 30-day period provided: (a) produce the body of the defendant or give reasons for non-production; and (b) explain satisfactorily why the defendant did not appear when first required to do so [4]. Rizal Surety failed to meet these requisites [5]. It did not produce the accused within the period set by the court, nor did it offer a satisfactory explanation for her initial failure to appear [5]. The Court found the surety negligent for merely relying on information from a guarantor and forwarding an alias warrant to the constabulary, rather than sending its own agents to track down the accused [5, 6]. Furthermore, the surrender of the accused occurred more than eight months after her appearance was required, causing undue delay in the criminal case [6].

The orders appealed from are affirmed [7].
