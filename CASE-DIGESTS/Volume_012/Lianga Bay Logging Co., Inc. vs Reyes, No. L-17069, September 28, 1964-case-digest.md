I. CAPTION
LIANGA BAY LOGGING CO., INC. v. HON. ANDRES REYES and GENERAL ENTERPRISES, INC., G.R. No. L-17069, September 28, 1964, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lianga Bay Logging Co., Inc. filed a petition to annul an order dated April 12, 1960, issued by respondent Judge Andres Reyes of the Court of First Instance of Rizal in Civil Case No. 6030 [1]. The order granted a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the petitioner from diverting logs to third parties unless it first complied with its commitment to deliver at least 2,000,000 board feet of logs to respondent General Enterprises, Inc. [1]. Subsequently, the lower court decided the main case in favor of General Enterprises, Inc., making the preliminary writ permanent [2]. Petitioner appealed the main decision to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-18487), which affirmed the lower court's judgment on August 31, 1964 [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition to annul the order of preliminary injunction has become moot.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the question regarding the propriety of the issuance of the preliminary injunction has become **moot and academic** [2]. The present petition was merely incidental to the main case (G.R. No. L-18487), which had already been decided by the Supreme Court shortly before this resolution [2]. Since the main case was affirmed, resolving the incidental issue of the preliminary injunction serves no further practical purpose.

The case is hereby dismissed [3].
