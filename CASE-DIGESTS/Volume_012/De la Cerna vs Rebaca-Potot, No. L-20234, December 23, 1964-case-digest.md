I. CAPTION
PAULA DE LA CERNA, ET AL. v. MANUELA REBACA POTOT, ET AL. and THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-20234, December 23, 1964, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In May 1939, spouses Bernabe de la Cerna and Gervasia Rebaca executed a joint will favoring their niece, Manuela Rebaca (respondent), as they had no children. When Bernabe died in August 1939, the will was submitted to probate. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu admitted the will to probate in October 1939, and the decree became final.

Gervasia died in 1952. A petition to probate the same will insofar as Gervasia was concerned was filed but later dismissed for failure to appear. Subsequently, the petitioners (intestate heirs of Bernabe) filed an action for partition. The CFI declared the testament null and void for being contrary to the prohibition against joint wills under the Civil Code. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the CFI, holding that the 1939 probate decree was issued by a court of competent jurisdiction and was conclusive as to the will's due execution, despite the prohibition on joint wills [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the 1939 probate decree of the joint will is conclusive as to the estate of the wife (Gervasia) who died later.

IV. RULING
**NO.** While the 1939 decree is conclusive as to the husband's estate, it is not binding on the wife's estate.

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's ruling that the 1939 probate decree is final and binding regarding Bernabe's estate. Although admitting a joint will was an error of law (as joint wills are prohibited under Art. 669 of the old Civil Code and Art. 818 of the new Civil Code), this error did not affect the probate court's jurisdiction. A final judgment on a probate petition is binding on the whole world [5, 6].

However, the Court modified the decision regarding Gervasia's share. The 1939 decree could only affect the share of the deceased husband. It could not include the disposition of the share of the wife, who was then still alive, because the probate court acquired no jurisdiction over her estate at that time [6]. Upon her death, the will must be re-examined *de novo* regarding her share. Since joint wills are prohibited by law, the will is void as to Gervasia. Consequently, her undivided interest passes to her intestate heirs, not the testamentary heir, unless a valid separate will exists [7-9].

**Judgment affirmed with modification.**
