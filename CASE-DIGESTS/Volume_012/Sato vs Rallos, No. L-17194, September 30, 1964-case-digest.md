I. CAPTION
PRIMITIVO SATO v. SIMEON RALLOS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17194, September 30, 1964, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant Simeon Rallos, as administrator of the Testate Estate of Numeriana Rallos and Intestate Estate of Victoria Rallos, engaged the services of Plaintiff Atty. Primitivo Sato (then a Congressman) to secure a reduction in the estates' inheritance tax assessment, which totaled P130,076.43. They agreed that if Sato reduced the liability to under P30,000, he would receive P20,000 in cash and one hectare of commercial-residential land. Sato successfully represented the estates, resulting in a reduced tax liability of P22,545.47, which was paid.

Rallos refused to pay the agreed fees, claiming Sato offered his services voluntarily as a politician and not as a lawyer. Sato filed a complaint for collection of attorney's fees against Rallos (as administrator and distributee) and subsequently included other distributees of the estate. The Court of First Instance of Cebu dismissed the complaint, ruling that Sato followed the wrong procedure; instead of an ordinary complaint, he should have filed a claim in the intestate proceedings or strictly followed the procedure in *Aldamiz vs. Judge of CFI of Mindoro*.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Sato is entitled to collect attorney's fees from the administrator and distributees despite the procedural objections and the distribution of the estate.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's dismissal. The Court held that the procedure adopted by Sato—filing the complaint against the administrator as such and as a distributee, as well as against other distributees—satisfied and even exceeded the legal requirements set forth in *Aldamiz vs. Judge of the CFI of Mindoro*.

Furthermore, the Court applied **Article 2142 of the Civil Code**, which enunciates that no one should unjustly enrich or benefit themselves at the expense of another. Since the estate and heirs were greatly benefited by Sato's services (saving over P100,000 in taxes), an award of fees is proper even if the estate had already been distributed. The Court fixed the reasonable compensation at P12,500, rejecting the claim for the land and the defense that the services were *gratis*.

**Disposition:** The decision appealed from is reversed. The administrator of the estate of Simeon Rallos is ordered to pay P12,500 to Sato, recoverable proportionately from the distributees.
