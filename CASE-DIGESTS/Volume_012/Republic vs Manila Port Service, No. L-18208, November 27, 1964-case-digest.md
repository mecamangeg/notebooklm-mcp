**I. CAPTION**
**REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. THE MANILA PORT SERVICE**, G.R. No. L-18208, November 27, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
The Manila Port Service (MPS), a subsidiary of the Manila Railroad Company, entered into a management contract with the Bureau of Customs in 1956 to handle arrastre services [1]. MPS failed to pay the fixed and percentage taxes imposed by Sections 182 and 191 of the National Internal Revenue Code, claiming tax exemption through its mother company [1, 2]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed MPS for deficiency taxes totaling P138,909.93. Despite repeated demands and a final decision by the CIR on February 13, 1959, MPS failed to pay and did not appeal the assessment to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [3-5].

Consequently, the CIR filed a complaint for collection in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [6]. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that the tax assessment was erroneous and thus unenforceable, even if the assessment had technically become final due to MPS's failure to appeal [6]. The Republic appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the taxpayer can dispute the validity of a tax assessment in a judicial action for collection after failing to appeal said assessment to the Court of Tax Appeals.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the assessment had already become final and executory because MPS failed to appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals within the reglementary period required by Section 7 and Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125 [7, 8].

Citing *Republic v. Magalona* and *Republic v. Albert*, the Court explained that upon the receipt of the final decision on the disputed assessment, the taxpayer has 30 days to appeal to the CTA [8, 9]. Failure to do so renders the assessment final, indisputable, and demandable [8]. In the subsequent action for collection, the taxpayer is barred from invoking defenses regarding the validity of the tax liability, such as the claim that the assessment was contrary to law, as these should have been litigated in the CTA [9-11].

**Disposition:** The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**. Appellee is ordered to pay the sum of P138,903.93 plus surcharges and costs [12].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, and Zaldivar concurred with the decision [12].
