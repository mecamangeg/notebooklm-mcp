I. CAPTION
VIRGILIO L. KATINDIG v. ATTY. JOSE BRILLANTES, Adm. Case No. 442, October 30, 1964, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Katindig, a detained prisoner, engaged Respondent Atty. Brillantes to handle the appeal of his conviction for qualified theft (Criminal Case No. 49325). Katindig paid P200.00 as partial payment for the appeal services. Subsequently, Respondent informed Katindig that he had failed to file the appellant's brief within the reglementary period. Feeling cheated, Katindig filed a complaint for malpractice on July 5, 1960, and requested a counsel *de oficio*.

The Solicitor General investigated and recommended a one-month suspension. However, the Supreme Court found that the information Respondent gave his client was factually erroneous. When Katindig filed the administrative complaint on July 5, 1960, the 30-day period to file the brief had not yet expired, as Respondent only received the notice from the Court of Appeals on June 30, 1960.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent committed misbehavior warranting disciplinary action by erroneously informing his client that he failed to file the brief on time.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that while the Respondent's act of furnishing erroneous information to his client—causing the client to believe the appeal was lost and to seek *de oficio* counsel—was "unwarranted behavior," it did not in itself constitute misbehavior sufficient to warrant disciplinary action. The Court noted that the neglect imputed (failure to file on time) did not actually exist at the time the complaint was filed.

However, since the Respondent did not render the legal service for which he was engaged (handling the appeal), he cannot retain the fees paid.

The complaint was **DISMISSED**, but Respondent was ordered to return the sum of P200.00 to the Complainant.
