I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ISAIAS CELESTINO, ET AL., FIRST QUEZON CITY INSURANCE CO., INC., G.R. No. L-19924, December 23, 1964, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
First Quezon City Insurance Co., Inc. (appellant) posted bail for the accused, Isaias Celestino, in a criminal case for estafa pending before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. When Celestino failed to appear for trial on October 25, 1961, the court ordered his arrest and the confiscation of the bond.

Five months later, on March 17, 1962, agents of the bonding company arrested Celestino in Santiago, Isabela, and turned him over to the Philippine Constabulary (PC) authorities there. The company then requested the PC to bring the accused to Manila. However, on March 23, 1962, the CFI of Isabela released the accused after accepting a new bond, purportedly authorized by the CFI of Manila.

The bonding company petitioned the CFI of Manila to lift the confiscation order, arguing that the non-surrender was due to the CFI of Isabela's release order. The CFI of Manila denied the motion, ruling that it never authorized the release and that the company failed in its duty by turning the accused over to the PC instead of the court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the bonding company’s liability is extinguished by surrendering the accused to the Constabulary authorities rather than the court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order confiscating the bond.

First, under Section 15, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court, a bondsman must satisfactorily explain the accused's failure to appear when first required. Here, the accused’s initial non-appearance on October 25, 1961, remained totally unexplained.

Second, the bonding company failed to comply with its undertaking. The rule is well-settled that sureties are the jailers of their principal (*People v. Tuising*). The company’s act of leaving the accused with PC authorities in Isabela instead of surrendering him directly to the CFI of Manila constituted a breach of its obligation. It cannot pass the responsibility of safe-keeping the accused to the Government.

Third, the release order by the CFI of Isabela did not excuse the breach. The order was issued a week after the arrest, leaving the delay unexplained. Furthermore, the CFI of Manila never authorized the release, making the CFI of Isabela's acceptance of a new bond improper.

The order appealed from is affirmed.
