I. CAPTION
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, petitioner, vs. CONCHITA VDA. DE CHAVEZ, in her own behalf and as Guardian Ad Litem for her minor children, and the WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, respondents., G.R. No. L-20103, September 30, 1964, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Eugenio Chavez worked as a crossing keeper for petitioner Manila Railroad Company at the San Andres Bukid Station from February 1946 until March 1957 [1]. He was hospitalized for pulmonary tuberculosis in late 1956 and again in March 1957, eventually dying of the disease on August 10, 1957 [1]. His work schedule involved a rotation where he was on duty at night for 30 out of every 45 days [2]. His work station was a "lean-to" without walls, flooring, or benches, exposing him to the elements [3].

Respondent Conchita Vda. de Chavez, his widow, filed a claim for compensation. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded compensation, finding that while the physical work was not strenuous, the night shifts and poor working conditions aggravated his illness [4, 5]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the death was not compensable and that the claim was barred by Section 24 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act due to lack of formal notice of injury and claim [1, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the illness and subsequent death of the employee is compensable.
2. W/N the claim for compensation is barred by the lack of formal notice of injury and claim.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the WCC's findings that the illness was aggravated by employment. Although the task of raising crossing bars was not physically strenuous, two factors established compensability: (a) **Night work service**, which required the deceased to be on duty during sleeping hours for two-thirds of his shift rotation, causing debilitating effects on his physique [2]; and (b) **Place of work**, which was a "miserably provided" shelter that offered no protection against rain or storm [3]. These conditions contributed to the worsening of his pulmonary tuberculosis [7].

2. **NO.** Under **Section 24 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act**, the absence of formal notice does not exempt the employer from liability if it had **actual knowledge** of the illness and death [8]. The Court found that petitioner knew of Chavez's condition as he was assigned to lighter day shifts, his son was allowed to substitute for him, and company officials helped the widow collect gratuity from the GSIS [9, 10]. Furthermore, the petitioner failed to report the illness and death to the Commission within the period prescribed by **Section 45** of the Act, which constitutes a renunciation of the right to controvert the claim [8].

**Decision and resolution affirmed.** [11]

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Reyes, J.B.L., J.**, concurred on the basis that the employer forfeited its right to controversion [11].
