**I. CAPTION**
GLODUALDO MENESES, EUFEMIO TRINIDAD, JOSE CALARA, NARCISO SIGUA and NICOLAS LORENZO v. ESTANISLAO LUAT and ABELARDO G. TINIO, G.R. No. L-18116, November 28, 1964, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 14, 1960, a cargo truck owned by defendant Abelardo G. Tinio and driven by defendant Estanislao Luat hit a horse-drawn rig (*carretela*) in Apalit, Pampanga. The accident killed the horse, wrecked the rig, and injured the passengers, plaintiffs Meneses et al. [1]. A criminal case for damage to property with serious physical injuries through reckless imprudence was filed against Luat. The plaintiffs were represented by private counsel who entered their appearance as private prosecutors [2]. Upon arraignment, Luat pleaded guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment and a fine; the court made no pronouncement on civil liability and no reservation was made by the plaintiffs [2]. Subsequently, plaintiffs filed a separate civil action for damages based on quasi-delict (Article 33 of the Civil Code) [3]. The trial court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the action was barred by the judgment in the criminal case because the plaintiffs had intervened without reserving their right to a separate civil action, citing *Roa v. De la Cruz* [1, 4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the separate civil action for damages is barred by the plaintiffs' appearance as private prosecutors in the criminal case where the accused pleaded guilty upon arraignment.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal order. The Court held that the rule in *Roa v. De la Cruz*—where active intervention by a private prosecutor through a full trial barred a separate action—did not apply to this case [4, 5]. Here, the criminal action did not proceed to trial because the accused pleaded guilty immediately upon arraignment [6]. The mere appearance of private counsel did not constitute "active intervention" sufficient to imply an intention to press for damages in the criminal action [6, 7]. It is reasonable to assume counsel appeared precisely to reserve the right to a separate civil action but was prevented from doing so by the immediate plea and sentence [6]. The plaintiffs' substantive right to claim damages under Article 33 of the Civil Code should not be foreclosed by such equivocal conduct at the inception of the proceedings [3, 8].

The order appealed from is set aside and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [9].
