I. CAPTION
GOLDEN RIBBON LUMBER COMPANY, INC. v. THE CITY OF BUTUAN and FRANCISCO MAGNO, G.R. No. L-18534, December 24, 1964, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Golden Ribbon Lumber Company, Inc. operated a lumber mill and yard in Butuan City. The City enacted Ordinance No. 5, as amended by Ordinance Nos. 9, 10, 47, and 49, which imposed a tax of P0.004 for every board foot of lumber sawn, manufactured, or produced within the city. Golden Ribbon paid a total of P2,069.26 in taxes under these ordinances, but only P1,190.92 was paid under protest.

Golden Ribbon filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan to declare the ordinance void and to recover the taxes paid, arguing that the tax was effectively on forest products, which the City was prohibited from taxing. The City and its Treasurer contended that the tax was a valid privilege tax on the business of lumber mills authorized under Section 15(p) of the City Charter (Republic Act No. 523). The CFI rendered a decision declaring the ordinance void and ordering the City to refund the amount paid under protest. The City appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the ordinance imposing a tax on lumber sawn, manufactured, or produced is valid.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to a refund of the taxes paid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court declared the ordinance null and void. The power of a municipal corporation to tax must be expressly conferred by its charter or statute and is construed strictly against the municipality. While Section 15(p) of R.A. No. 523 authorizes the City to tax "lumber mills and lumber yards," this does not include the power to tax the "sale, production, sawing and/or manufacture" of lumber. The Court held that the character of a tax is determined by its operation, not its title. Here, the tax was not conditioned on the privilege of doing business, but was calculated based on the output of lumber. Furthermore, sawn lumber is classified as a "forest product" under Section 268 of the National Internal Revenue Code. Under Commonwealth Act No. 472 and Republic Act No. 2264, municipal corporations are expressly prohibited from imposing taxes or charges on forest products.

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the refund, but limited it to the amount of P1,190.92. This was the specific sum proven to have been paid by Golden Ribbon Lumber Company under protest, which is a requisite for recovery in this case.

The decision of the lower court is affirmed.
