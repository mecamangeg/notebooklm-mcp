I. CAPTION
EMETERIO A. BUYCO and HUGO B. DAGUMAN v. HON. MARIANO A. ZOSA, Adm. Case No. 101, March 27, 1968, 23 SCRA 1235, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Complainants Buyco (City Auditor) and Daguman filed an administrative complaint against respondent Judge Zosa of the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental. The complaint alleged six counts: (1) falsification of public documents under Art. 171 of the RPC regarding gasoline allowance vouchers and vehicle ownership certifications; (2) violation of constitutional right to bail; (3) arbitrary detention under Art. 124 of the RPC; (4) conduct unbecoming; (5) indiscretion; and (6) vindictiveness. These charges largely stemmed from contempt proceedings the Judge instituted against the complainants, where he ordered their detention, and from claims for gasoline allowances authorized by the Ozamis City Council. The Supreme Court referred the case to Justice Ruperto G. Martin of the Court of Appeals for investigation. The investigator found that the gasoline claims were based on a resolution that was not initially strictly on a "reimbursement" basis, and the vehicle ownership claims had colorable truth. Regarding the contempt charges, the investigator found the Judge acted within his powers to detain for contempt and readily approved bail when petitioned.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the administrative charges against the respondent Judge were established by a preponderance of evidence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court adopted the findings of the investigator that the charges were not established by a preponderance of evidence. regarding the falsification charge, the Court held that the discrepancy in the vouchers was not malicious as the Judge’s claim of "commutable" allowance was a mere conclusion, and his claim of ownership over the vehicles had colorable truth based on his arrangement with the registered owner. Regarding the charges of arbitrary detention and violation of the right to bail, the Court found the Judge acted within his discretion to order detention in contempt proceedings and showed no vindictiveness as he readily approved the bail bond when petitioned.

The Court ruled that while the respondent may have allowed himself to be carried away by his desire to uphold the dignity of his office, thereby creating the erroneous impression that he was disposed to take advantage of his position, he is entitled to exoneration. There was no clear and convincing evidence that he acted partially, maliciously, corruptly, or oppressively. Errors of judgment do not rise to the category of serious misconduct.

Respondent Judge is **EXONERATED**.
