I. CAPTION
ALEJANDRA CUARTO v. ESTELITA DE LUNA, LEONARDO DE LUNA, IRENE CASTILLO, BONIFACIO NAKPIL and AIDA SOLIMAN, G.R. No. L-23279, January 31, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Alejandra Cuarto, the widow of Sotero de Luna, filed a complaint against her stepchildren (Estelita and Leonardo) and the spouses Bonifacio Nakpil and Aida Soliman (the Nakpils) regarding two lots in San Juan Heights [1]. Cuarto alleged that the lots were conjugal property and that Sotero, during his lifetime, executed a simulated deed of sale in 1947 to his daughter Estelita for an unpaid consideration [1]. Estelita subsequently simulated a transfer to Leonardo, who then simulated a sale to the Nakpils in 1962 [1]. Cuarto claimed all transactions were fictitious, simulated, and without consideration, and that the Nakpils knew the titles were defective [1].

The Nakpils moved to dismiss based on prescription, arguing the action was barred as more than ten years had passed since the first transaction [2]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal granted the motion, ruling that the transactions were merely voidable and the action had prescribed [2]. Cuarto appealed [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action to declare the contracts void is barred by extinctive prescription.
2. W/N the defendants acquired the property via acquisitive prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A motion to dismiss hypothetically admits the allegations in the complaint [3]. Since the complaint specifically alleged the transactions were "fictitious, simulated and without any consideration," the contracts are legally treated as inexistent, not merely voidable [3], [4]. Under Article 1410 of the Civil Code and established jurisprudence (e.g., *Quetulio v. Ver*, *Tipton v. Velasco*), the action or defense for the declaration of the inexistence of a contract does not prescribe [4].

2. **NO.** Acquisitive prescription requires "actual, adverse possession" by one "claiming to be the owner" continuously for ten years [5]. The complaint's allegations, which are deemed admitted by the motion to dismiss, state that the transactions were simulated and the defendants were aware of this fact [5]. This negates the existence of adverse possession in the concept of an owner, which is a requisite for acquiring real property by prescription [5].

The orders appealed from are REVERSED and the case is REMANDED to the lower court for further proceedings [6].
