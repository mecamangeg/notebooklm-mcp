I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LUIS CATALINO Y ARNISTO**, G.R. No. L-25403, March 15, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of June 2, 1961, in Altavas, Aklan, Raymundo Gregorio was drinking *tuba* with his wife, Maria, in their home when he was suddenly stabbed in the abdomen through the bamboo floor. Maria looked out the kitchen door with a kerosene lamp and saw a man moving away, whom she recognized as her brother, the accused Luis Catalino. She shouted at him before attending to her husband, who died shortly after. The accused and the victim had a long-standing feud over inheritance and the accused's separation from his common-law wife (the victim's sister).

During trial, the accused raised the defense of alibi and presented the extra-judicial confessions of two detention prisoners, Rodrigo Tulio and Federico Leyson, who admitted to the killing. However, these third parties repudiated their confessions in court, claiming they were extracted through torture. The Court of First Instance of Aklan convicted Catalino of murder and sentenced him to death.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the widow’s identification of the accused as the assailant is credible.
2. W/N the extra-judicial confessions of third parties are admissible to exculpate the accused.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court found the widow's identification credible, deferring to the trial court's assessment of witness demeanor. Despite the stress of the incident, it was not unnatural for her to recognize her own brother given the illumination from the lamp and their close proximity. The defense of alibi cannot prosper against positive identification, especially since the accused lived only 2.5 kilometers away.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled the confessions inadmissible on two grounds. First, the evidence showed they were not voluntary but coerced through manhandling. Second, under the Rules of Court (Rule 130), an extra-judicial confession is evidence only against the declarant (Sec. 29). While a declaration against interest (Sec. 32) may be used against third persons, it requires the declarant to be deceased, outside the Philippines, or unable to testify, which was not the case here. Furthermore, jurisprudence holds that a confession by a third party tending to exculpate an accused is hearsay and inadmissible unless it constitutes part of the *res gestae*.

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** with the modification that the penalty is reduced to *reclusion perpetua* due to the lack of necessary votes for the death penalty.
