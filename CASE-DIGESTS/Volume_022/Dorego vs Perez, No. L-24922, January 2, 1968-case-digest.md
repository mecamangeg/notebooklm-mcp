I. CAPTION
MELECIO DOREGO and FELICIDAD DOREGO v. ARISTON PEREZ, THE HONORABLE RAMON BLANCO, and THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF ILOILO, G.R. No. L-24922, January 2, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Perez obtained a judgment in a foreclosure suit (Civil Case No. 5568) against petitioner Dorego spouses. Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA). Subsequently, petitioners' counsel filed a manifestation to withdraw the appeal, alleging the parties had amicably settled the case for P1,300.00. The CA required petitioners to submit their written conformity and pay the docket fees. Petitioners failed to comply, leading the CA to dismiss the appeal specifically for failure to pay docket fees. The trial court then ordered the execution of the original judgment, and the mortgaged properties were sold. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the execution was grave abuse of discretion because the judgment had been novated by the amicable settlement, evidenced by a receipt signed by the parties' counsels.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the alleged amicable settlement entered into by counsel validly novated the judgment to bar its execution.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the amicable settlement was not validly established. The receipt presented by petitioners proved only a personal agreement between the counsels, not the parties. Under **Section 23, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court**, attorneys cannot compromise their client's litigation without special authorization. Petitioners failed to prove that respondent's counsel had such special authority. Furthermore, the CA dismissed the appeal due to the non-payment of docket fees, not because of the alleged settlement. Under **Sections 2 and 4, Rule 50 of the Rules of Court**, the dismissal of an appeal causes the questioned judgment to stand as if no appeal had been instituted. Thus, the trial court's order of execution was proper.

The petition is **DISMISSED**.
