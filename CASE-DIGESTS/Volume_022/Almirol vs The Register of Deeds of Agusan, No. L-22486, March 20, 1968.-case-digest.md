I. CAPTION
TEODORO ALMIROL v. THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF AGUSAN, G.R. No. L-22486, March 20, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On June 28, 1961, Teodoro Almirol purchased a parcel of land in Esperanza, Agusan from Arcenio Abalo. The land was covered by an Original Certificate of Title registered in the name of "Arcenio Abalo, married to Nicolasa M. Abalo." In May 1962, Almirol presented the deed of sale to the Register of Deeds of Agusan for registration. The Register of Deeds refused to register the document, asserting that because the wife was already deceased, the property (presumed conjugal) required liquidation and partition among the heirs before the husband could dispose of it [1-3].

Almirol filed a petition for *mandamus* with the Court of First Instance of Agusan to compel the registration. The Register of Deeds argued that Almirol failed to exhaust the administrative remedy of appealing to the Commissioner of Land Registration [3, 4]. The lower court dismissed the petition, ruling that *mandamus* did not lie because the adequate remedy was provided by Section 4 of Republic Act No. 1151 [4]. Almirol appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Register of Deeds has the power to determine the validity of a document and refuse registration on that basis.
2. W/N *mandamus* lies to compel the Register of Deeds to register the deed of sale.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Register of Deeds has no authority to determine the validity of a document presented for registration; that function properly belongs to a court of competent jurisdiction [5, 6]. Under Section 4 of Republic Act No. 1151, the Register of Deeds is precluded from exercising personal judgment regarding the invalidity of an instrument [5, 7]. If in doubt as to the proper step to be taken, the Register of Deeds must certify the question to the Commissioner of Land Registration [7]. Registration does not require that only valid instruments be registered, as questions of invalidity should be litigated after registration [8].

2. **NO.** Although the Register of Deeds erred in assessing the validity of the contract, *mandamus* does not lie. Section 4 of Republic Act No. 1151 provides a specific administrative remedy: when a party in interest disagrees with the Register of Deeds, the matter shall be submitted to the Commissioner of Land Registration, whose decision is binding upon all Registers of Deeds [9-11]. The petitioner must exhaust this administrative remedy before resorting to the courts [9, 11].

The Resolution of the lower court dismissing the petition is **AFFIRMED** [12].
