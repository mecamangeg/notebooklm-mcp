I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION AS CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, SANTIAGO YAP alias YAP YU HAI v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-23385, February 27, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Santiago Yap filed a petition for naturalization, which the Court of First Instance of Davao granted on March 1, 1963. The Republic appealed, arguing that Yap failed to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner [1]. A witness, Victor Rodriguez, testified that Yap violated the election law by actively campaigning for a candidate during the 1961 national elections—hauling voters in a truck and distributing drinks [2]. Additionally, Rodriguez testified that Yap intervened in the 1962 barrio elections by supporting a rival candidate [2]. In rebuttal, Yap’s witness offered only weak, non-categorical denials, and Yap himself failed to deny his participation in the 1962 barrio elections [3], [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner’s participation in elections disqualifies him from Philippine citizenship for failure to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. Under Sections 56 and 183 of the Revised Election Code, foreigners are strictly prohibited from aiding any candidate or influencing any election; a violation thereof constitutes a serious election offense [5], [6]. The Court emphasized that the right of suffrage is reserved for Filipinos and alien interference is "to be condemned" [5]. Citing *Benluy v. Republic* (94 Phil. 110), the Court ruled that engaging in such prohibited political activities demonstrates that the petitioner has not conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner [7], [8]. Consequently, the decision appealed from was reversed and the petition for naturalization was denied [9].
