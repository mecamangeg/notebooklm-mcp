I. CAPTION
GREGORIO ROBLES v. CONCEPCION FERNANDO BLAYLOCK, JACOBO ABRAJANO, and ALADINO ANDRADE, G.R. Nos. L-24123, L-24124, L-24125 & L-24126, March 27, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Robles and respondent Blaylock were existing taxicab operators in Olongapo. To address the need for more transport, multiple applications were filed: Robles requested "ten (10) or more" additional units; Blaylock applied for 5; and newcomers Abrajano and Andrade applied for 30 and 5 units, respectively [1-3]. The Public Service Commission (PSC) consolidated the cases, finding a public necessity for 40 additional units. To promote healthy competition, the PSC awarded 10 units to Robles, 5 to Blaylock, 20 to Abrajano, and 5 to Andrade [4, 5]. Robles appealed, invoking the "prior operator rule," arguing that as an existing operator who prayed for "10 or more" units, he should have been awarded the units granted to the newcomers [6]. Procedurally, Robles received the PSC decision on January 6, 1965, but filed his notice of appeal with the PSC on February 12, 1965, 37 days later [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Robles is entitled to preference over the new applicants under the "prior operator rule" for the remaining units.
2. W/N the appeal was perfected within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The "prior operator rule" does not apply where it impedes public convenience. The Court held that wholesome and constructive competition should be allowed to promote satisfaction and efficiency in public service [8]. Robles failed to show that competition from the newcomers would be ruinous or destructive. Furthermore, his application for "ten (10) or more" units is deemed a prayer for only ten units [9]. An applicant cannot use vague phrases like "or more" to establish a monopoly or claim a right to fill future needs for which he has not proven financial capacity [10, 11]. Since Robles only proved the capacity for 10 units, he cannot claim the units awarded to others [9].

2. **NO.** The appeal was not perfected on time. Under Rule 44, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, an appellant must file a notice of appeal with the PSC within 30 days from notice of the decision [12]. Robles filed his notice 37 days after receiving the decision [7]. This failure to file within the statutory period is a fatal error.

Petition dismissed [13].
