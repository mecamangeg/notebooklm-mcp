I. CAPTION
BIENVENIDO F. REYES v. ROMEO G. ABELEDA, SECRETARY OF EDUCATION, DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS, COMMISSIONER OF CIVIL SERVICE & CASHIER AND DISBURSING OFFICER OF THE BUREAU OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS, G.R. No. L-25491, February 27, 1968, 131 Phil. 826, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Reyes and Respondent Abeleda were both Budget Officers III in the Bureau of Public Schools. Reyes was assigned to the School Finance Division in an *acting* capacity (appointed August 21, 1962), while Abeleda was in the Medical and Dental Services Division in a *permanent* capacity (appointed July 1, 1962) [1, 2]. Abeleda had been in government service since 1937, while Reyes joined in 1939 [1, 3].

When the position of Budget Officer IV became vacant, the Director of Public Schools recommended Reyes. However, the Secretary of Education appointed Abeleda [1]. Reyes protested to the Civil Service Commissioner, who upheld Abeleda’s appointment. Reyes then filed a petition for *certiorari* and *mandamus* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [1, 4]. The CFI ruled in favor of Reyes, declaring Abeleda's appointment void because Reyes was the officer "next in rank" within the specific division where the vacancy occurred [5]. Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner was the person "next in rank" entitled to the promotion over the respondent.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the petitioner was not the person "next in rank" because he held the position of Budget Officer III only in an *acting* capacity, unlike the respondent whose tenure was *permanent* [2].

Under Section 23 of Republic Act No. 2260 (Civil Service Act), while a person next in rank is entitled to a vacancy, "should there be two or more persons under equal circumstances, seniority must be given preference" [2]. Even assuming both were of equal circumstances, Abeleda was senior in both total government service (since 1937 vs. 1939) and in the specific position of Budget Officer III (July 1962 vs. August 1962) [3, 7].

Furthermore, the appointing power (Secretary of Education) enjoys sufficient discretion to select employees based on fitness to perform duties [8]. Unless the law imposes a rigid formula, the Department Head's discretion in determining who best serves the public interest should be recognized and not interfered with by the courts absent abuse [9].

The judgment of the lower court is reversed and the petition for *certiorari* and *mandamus* is denied [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, and Angeles concurred [10].
