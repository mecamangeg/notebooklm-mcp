**I. CAPTION**
ST. PAUL FIRE & MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY v. MACONDRAY & CO., INC., ET AL., MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-24826, March 20, 1968, Angeles, J.

**II. FACTS**
St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Company (St. Paul) insured a shipment of 218 packages of medicinal products consigned to Winthrop Stearns, Inc., which arrived in Manila on August 7, 1960, on board the SS *Tai Ping*. The shipment was discharged into the custody of the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service, on August 11, 1960 [1]. The consignee filed a provisional claim for damage and loss on August 10, 1960, one day before the discharge of the last package [2]. St. Paul, as subrogee of the consignee, filed a complaint for recovery of sums against the carrier and the arrastre operator [3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of St. Paul, holding the Manila Port Service liable for one undelivered carton and damages to three others [4]. The Manila Port Service appealed, arguing that the provisional claim was invalid as it was not filed within the 15-day period prescribed by paragraph 15 of the Management Contract, having been filed prematurely [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a provisional claim filed before the discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel constitutes compliance with the Management Contract.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that a provisional claim for shortage or damage filed against the arrastre operator before the discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel is not compliance with the Management Contract because such a claim is "premature and speculative" [2], [5]. To allow such claims would overwhelm the arrastre service with advance claims from brokers for all consigned goods [6].

The Court distinguished this case from *Switzerland General Insurance Co. v. Java Pacific & Hoegh Lines*, where an advance claim was allowed because a joint examination of the shipment revealing shortages occurred before the final discharge. In this case, no such examination took place in the presence of both parties to justify an exception [7].

ACCORDINGLY, the decision appealed from is hereby **REVERSED** [8].
