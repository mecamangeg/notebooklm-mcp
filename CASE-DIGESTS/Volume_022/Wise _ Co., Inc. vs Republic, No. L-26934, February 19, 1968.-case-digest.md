I. CAPTION
WISE & COMPANY, INC. v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, and CUSTOMS ARRASTRE SERVICE, G.R. No. L-26934, February 19, 1968, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
Wise & Company, Inc. was the consignee of 500 packages of paper bags shipped from England and discharged into the custody of the Customs Arrastre Service in Manila [1]. The Arrastre Service delivered only 438 bags, 31 of which were damaged, leading the consignee to claim P549.30 for the value of the undelivered and damaged goods [1]. When the demand was not met, Wise & Co. filed an action in the City Court of Manila against the Republic, the Bureau of Customs, and the Customs Arrastre Service [2]. Both the City Court and the Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the plaintiff, ordering the defendants to pay, despite the defendants' defense of non-suability and failure to comply with the requirements for money claims against the government [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Republic and the Bureau of Customs can be sued for claims arising from the operation of the arrastre service without their consent.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Bureau of Customs operates the arrastre service as a mere incident of a proper governmental function—specifically, the assessment and collection of lawful revenues from imported articles [3, 4]. As such, the Republic and its agencies may not be sued for the same without their consent, pursuant to the doctrine of state immunity [4]. The Court reiterated the rule established in *Mobil Philippines Exploration v. Customs Arrastre Service* [3]. Furthermore, money claims against the government must follow the procedure prescribed in Act No. 3083, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 327 [4].

Judgment reversed; suit dismissed [5].
