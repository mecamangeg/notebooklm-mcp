I. CAPTION
RICARDO DEQUITO v. LEOPOLDO LOPEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-27757, March 28, 1968, 22 SCRA 541, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellant Ricardo Dequito was employed as a security guard by the defendants-appellees in their agricultural enterprise in Davao from November 11, 1958, until his dismissal on July 11, 1963 [1]. Dequito filed a complaint against the defendants seeking separation pay, pay differentials, and overtime pay [1]. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that because Dequito was a former agricultural employee, his claims fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) pursuant to the Agricultural Land Reform Code (R.A. No. 3844) [2]. The Court of First Instance of Davao granted the motion and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that the matter was within the exclusive competence of the CAR [3]. Dequito appealed the order of dismissal to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction over money claims filed by a security guard employed in an agricultural enterprise.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) has jurisdiction, not the Court of Agrarian Relations.

Section 154(1) of the Agricultural Land Reform Code vests the CAR with original and exclusive jurisdiction over "money claims arising from agrarian relations" [4]. The Court reasoned that although the defendants operated an agricultural enterprise, Dequito's work as a security guard does not involve "agrarian relations" [4]. The work of a security guard lacks the elements necessary to create an agrarian relationship between a proprietor and tenants, lessees, or workers; rather, it constitutes an ordinary employment relationship [4, 5]. To interpret the work of a security guard as covered by agrarian relations would unduly stretch the law and contravene the legislative intent to limit the CAR's jurisdiction to disputes requiring its specific expertise in agrarian matters [4, 5].

Consequently, the Order of dismissal was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [6].
