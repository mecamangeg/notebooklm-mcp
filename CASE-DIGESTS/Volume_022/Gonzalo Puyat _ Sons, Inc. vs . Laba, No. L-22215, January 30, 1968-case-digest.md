I. CAPTION
GONZALO PUYAT & SONS, INC. v. PEDRO LABAYO and THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-22215, January 30, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Pedro Labayo, a foreman for petitioner Gonzalo Puyat & Sons, Inc. since 1938, filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) on May 16, 1963 [1]. He alleged that he was dismissed without just cause on March 19, 1963, without notice or separation pay [1]. Labayo prayed for reinstatement with back wages, or alternatively separation pay, as well as payment for overtime services and Sunday work rendered during his employment [2].

Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. The CIR Judge denied the motion, and the CIR *en banc* denied the subsequent motion for reconsideration [2]. Petitioner elevated the matter to the Supreme Court via certiorari and prohibition, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction over the claims [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has jurisdiction over the claims for overtime pay, back wages, and separation pay.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the CIR has jurisdiction. Under well-entrenched jurisprudence, the CIR has jurisdiction over claims for overtime pay arising under the Eight-Hour Labor Law when the claimant also seeks reinstatement or the reestablishment of the employer-employee relationship [3, 4].

Furthermore, the Court held that along with the overtime claim, the CIR has the authority to act on other demands such as back wages and separation pay [5]. When a prayer for reinstatement is made, these claims all arise out of or are in connection with the employment [5]. The Court emphasized that splitting jurisdiction is gravely prejudicial to the administration of justice as it leads to a multiplicity of suits, wasted effort, and additional expense [6, 7]. It is more in keeping with the orderly administration of justice that all causes of action be heard by one court [7].

The petition for certiorari and prohibition was dismissed [8].
