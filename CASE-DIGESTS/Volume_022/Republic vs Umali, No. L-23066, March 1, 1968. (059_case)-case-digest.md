I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. VICENTE C. UMALI and STATE BONDING & INSURANCE CO., INC., G.R. No. L-23066, March 1, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
The Republic, through the Solicitor General, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against Vicente Umali (promoter) and State Bonding & Insurance Co., Inc. (surety) to recover P12,078.02, representing the unpaid purses of five boxers [1]. The claim was based on a P32,500 surety bond posted by the defendants in favor of the Games and Amusements Board (GAB) for a boxing event held on February 1, 1961 [1].

Although the bond recital mentioned Article 3, paragraphs (b) and (d) of the GAB Rules and Regulations—which require bonds to cover boxers' purses and a percentage of gross receipts—the specific condition stipulated in the bond was "to insure reimbursement to the purchasers of tickets" in case the event was not held [2], [3]. The bond expressly stated that if the contest took place on February 1, 1961, the obligation would be "null and void" [3]. The contest was held as scheduled [4]. The CFI dismissed the complaint on the ground that the bond had been discharged. The Republic appealed, arguing the bond should be construed to cover the obligations under the GAB Rules [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the surety is liable for the boxers' purses based on the GAB Rules cited in the bond, despite the bond's express terms limiting liability to ticket reimbursement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. The Court ruled that the extent of a surety's liability is determined strictly by the clauses of the contract of suretyship [6], [7].

The bond clearly stated that its purpose was to insure reimbursement to ticket purchasers if the fight did not occur, and that the obligation would be null and void if the fight was held [4]. Since the event took place as scheduled, the bond was discharged [4]. While the bond was executed pursuant to GAB regulations, and such regulations normally form part of the bond, they cannot be construed "to enlarge the surety's liability beyond the terms of his contract" [8]. The Court noted that while the bond was defective for failing to secure the purses as required by the Rules, the State failed to object to the bond's terms when it was filed [8], [7]. Where the terms of the bond are clear and leave no room for interpretation, the bond is incapable of extension by implication [7].

The order of the trial court is affirmed [9].
