I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. JOSE CONCEPCION, as Ancillary Administrator of the Estate of Mary H. Mitchel-Roberts (deceased), and JACK F. MITCHELL-ROBERTS, No. L-23912, March 15, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents, representing the estate of Mary H. Mitchel-Roberts and her husband Jack F. Mitchell-Roberts, were assessed estate and inheritance taxes amounting to P1,181.33 and P2,616.10 by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) on 50 shares of stock. The CIR claimed a transmission of conjugal property occurred upon the wife's death [1]. Respondents disputed this, arguing that under English law and the "joint tenants with full rights of survivorship" clause, no transmission occurred [1]. Respondents previously appealed this assessment to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA Case No. 168), but the CTA dismissed the appeal because it was filed beyond the 30-day reglementary period, and the decision became final [1, 2].

Subsequently, Respondents paid the taxes and filed a claim for refund [2]. When the refund was not immediately acted upon, they instituted a new petition for review (CTA Case No. 669) to recover the amounts paid [2]. The CTA ruled in favor of Respondents, ordering the refund, holding that there was no procedural obstacle to the suit and that under English law, no tax was demandable [3]. The CIR petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing estoppel due to the finality of the previous dismissal [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a taxpayer can maintain a suit for the recovery of taxes paid under protest if the assessment had already become final and executory due to the taxpayer's failure to appeal within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that Section 306 of the National Internal Revenue Code, which allows for the recovery of tax erroneously or illegally collected, is not available to revive the right to contest the validity of an assessment which had become final for failure to appeal on time [5].

The Court cited *Republic v. Lim Tian Teng Sons & Co., Inc.*, reaffirming that a taxpayer's failure to appeal to the CTA in due time makes the assessment final, executory, and demandable, barring them from disputing its correctness [6]. Similarly, in *Morales v. Collector of Internal Revenue*, it was held that a final assessment cannot be reopened through other expedients [6]. Since the Respondents lost their right to appeal the assessment in CTA Case No. 168, the liability became indisputable, and they have no legal right to sue for recovery after payment [7].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **REVERSED** [8].
