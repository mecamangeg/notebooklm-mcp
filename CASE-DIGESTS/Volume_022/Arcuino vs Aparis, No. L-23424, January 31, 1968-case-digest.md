I. CAPTION
LOURDES ARCUINO, ELEUTERIA LAUDE, FLORENCIA PATOMBON and ANGELITA PATOMBON v. RUFINA APARIS and CASIANO PURAY, G.R. No. L-23424, January 31, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On May 26, 1964, plaintiffs Arcuino, et al. filed an action for recovery of possession, damages, and legal redemption regarding Lot No. 355 against defendants Aparis and Puray. Plaintiffs claimed rights to the land by succession. Defendants, however, had been in adverse possession of the property since 1946, having purchased it from predecessors who acquired it in 1938.

The trial court set the case for pre-trial on June 17, 1964. Neither the plaintiffs nor their counsel appeared on said date. Consequently, the trial court issued an order dismissing the case. Plaintiffs' counsel filed a Motion for Reconsideration, alleging "excusable mistake" and claiming he honestly believed the pre-trial was set for June 19. The trial court denied the motion. Plaintiffs appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the case and denying the motion for reconsideration due to the plaintiffs' failure to appear at the pre-trial.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion. First, the Court found the counsel's explanation for the non-appearance unsatisfactory, as notice had been duly served and the associate counsel could have appeared. The dismissal for failure to appear at pre-trial is authorized under the Rules (*Peralta Vda. de Caina v. Reyes*), and reconsideration rests upon the sound discretion of the trial judge (*Smith Bell & Co. v. American President Lines*).

Second, the Court noted that reinstating the case would be futile. The complaint itself admitted defendants had been in adverse possession for 18 years (since 1946), and their predecessors for another 8 years, totaling 26 years. While lands registered under the Torrens system cannot be acquired by prescription, the plaintiffs were not the registered owners but merely claimed by succession. Thus, their claim was barred by laches (*Mejia de Lucas v. Gampoma*).

The order appealed from is hereby affirmed.
