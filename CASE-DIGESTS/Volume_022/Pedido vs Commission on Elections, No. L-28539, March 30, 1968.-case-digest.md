I. CAPTION
SALVADOR Q. PEDIDO and THE FIRST MUNICIPAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS FOR PIODURAN, ALBAY vs. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, et al., G.R. No. L-28539, March 30, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Salvador Pedido (reelectionist) and respondent Protesto Pavia were candidates for Mayor of Pioduran, Albay in the November 1967 elections [1]. The First Municipal Board of Canvassers stopped the canvass on December 13 due to a discrepancy in the return for Precinct 28 and were subsequently suspended [2, 3]. A Second Board proclaimed Pavia on December 14, but this was set aside by the COMELEC supervisor for lack of authority [4].

On December 22, the suspended First Board convened in Pedido's house without notifying the Election Registrar or Municipal Treasurer. Without possession of the election returns (which remained with the Treasurer), they created an "improvised tally" based on their "noted records" and fabricated figures for Precincts 7 and 8 to favor Pedido, subsequently proclaiming him winner [4-6]. COMELEC Supervisor Kalambakal declared this proclamation void, suspended the recalcitrant First Board members, and appointed a Third Board [4, 7]. On December 28, the Third Board canvassed using authentic returns and proclaimed Pavia [7]. COMELEC confirmed the Third Board's actions [8]. Pedido filed a petition for certiorari, arguing COMELEC lost jurisdiction over the election after his December 22 proclamation [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the December 22 proclamation by the First Board of Canvassers was valid.
2. W/N the COMELEC had authority to suspend the First Board and confirm the Third Board's proclamation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The December 22 proclamation is null and void. Under **Section 168 of the Revised Election Code**, the board of canvassers has a mandatory duty to count votes "as shown in all the election returns" [9]. The First Board did not have the election returns before them as these were in the possession of the municipal treasurer [10]. A canvass cannot be made without returns; thus, there was no canvass at all [11]. Furthermore, the Court found an "obvious fabrication of figures" in the improvised tally for Precincts 7 and 8 to ensure Pedido's victory [6, 12]. A proclamation based on an illegal canvass and manipulated figures is void ab initio [13].

2. **YES.** **Section 3 of the Revised Election Code** grants COMELEC "direct and immediate supervision" over municipal boards of canvassers [13]. This statutory provision empowers COMELEC to suspend members who fail to comply with its orders and appoint temporary substitutes [13]. This power is derived from the COMELEC's constitutional duty to enforce laws relative to the conduct of elections and insure "free, orderly, and honest elections" [14]. Since the First Board's proclamation was illegal, COMELEC acted within its jurisdiction to annul it and recognize the valid proclamation made by the Third Board on December 28 [15, 16].

Petition denied.
