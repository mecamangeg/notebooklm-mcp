**I. CAPTION**
COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. GOODRICH INTERNATIONAL RUBBER CO., G.R. No. L-22265, March 27, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., Actg. C.J.

**II. FACTS**
On December 22, 1967, the Supreme Court rendered a decision modifying a Court of Tax Appeals ruling, holding that respondent Goodrich International Rubber Co.'s representation expenses were fully taxable and reducing its claim for bad debts [1]. Subsequently, the Petitioner Collector of Internal Revenue filed a Motion for Reconsideration, praying that the respondent also be ordered to pay the 5% surcharge and 1% monthly interest provided in Section 51(e) of the National Internal Revenue Code (prior to amendment by R.A. No. 2343) [2]. Respondent opposed the motion, arguing that the claim for surcharge and monthly interest was not specifically raised in the petitioner's assignment of errors during the appeal [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court may impose statutory surcharges and interest even if the petitioner failed to assign them as errors in the appeal.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that the imposition of the 5% surcharge and 1% monthly interest is expressly required by the statute [3]. Consequently, the mere failure to assign this omission as an error in the appeal is not an obstacle to its imposition where proper [3]. The Court emphasized that "taxes are the lifeblood of the government and their prompt and certain availability an imperious need" (citing *Bull v. U.S.*, 79 L. Ed. 1421, 1427) [3].

Accordingly, the Motion for Reconsideration was granted, and the dispositive portion of the main decision was modified to order Goodrich International Rubber Co. to pay the deficiency income taxes for 1951 and 1952 plus the 5% surcharge and 1% monthly interest thereon until full payment [3, 4].
