I. CAPTION
RAFAEL FALCOTELO, et al. v. RESTITUTO GALI, et al., G.R. No. L-24190, January 8, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Falcotelo, et al. claimed to have been elected as barrio captain and councilmen of Bagong Barrio, Caloocan City, in an election held on January 12, 1964 [1]. However, the old Barrio Council had previously postponed the election to January 26, 1964, citing lack of funds and boundary uncertainties [2]. On the rescheduled date of January 26, a new election was held, and Respondents Gali, et al. were proclaimed elected [3].

On March 17, 1964, Petitioners filed a petition denominated as *quo warranto* with the City Court of Caloocan to challenge Respondents' titles [1, 4]. The City Court dismissed the case, ruling that while it had jurisdiction under the Revised Barrio Charter, the action was barred by the statute of limitations [5]. On appeal, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal dismissed the appeal on the ground that the City Court lacked jurisdiction over *quo warranto* proceedings, which the CFI believed fell under its own original jurisdiction pursuant to the Judiciary Act and Rules of Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City Court had jurisdiction over the dispute regarding barrio elections.
2. W/N the petition was filed within the prescriptive period.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The City Court (formerly Justice of the Peace Court) has exclusive original jurisdiction. Section 8 of the Revised Barrio Charter (R.A. 3590) explicitly provides that "all disputes over barrio elections" shall be brought before the Justice of the Peace Court of the municipality concerned [6]. The Court ruled that this phrase is absolute and imperatively confers jurisdiction on inferior courts for the sake of prompt solutions to barrio election controversies, covering both election contests and *quo warranto* proceedings arising therefrom [7]. The CFI erred in applying the general provisions of the Judiciary Act (R.A. 296) over the specific charter provisions [8].

2. **NO.** The petition was filed out of time. Under Sections 173 and 174 of the Revised Election Code (R.A. 180), which governs the procedure for barrio elections absent a conflict with the Barrio Charter, the eligibility of an official (*quo warranto*) must be contested within one (1) week after proclamation, while an election contest based on irregularities must be filed within two (2) weeks [4, 9]. Respondents were proclaimed on January 26, 1964, but Petitioners filed the case only on March 17, 1964—over seven weeks later [4]. Thus, regardless of the nature of the action, it was barred by the statute of limitations [4].

Petition dismissed [10].
