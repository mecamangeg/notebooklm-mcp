I. CAPTION
PEDRO VIDAL and DAVID BAETIONG v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-24660, March 28, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On May 16, 1961, Pedro Vidal executed a deed of sale transferring a certificate of public convenience (CPC), allegedly granted in PSC Case No. 63708, and several jeepneys to David Baetiong for P7,000.00 [2]. They filed an application for the approval of the sale with the Public Service Commission (PSC), which initially granted provisional approval subject to revocation [2, 3]. However, on November 29, 1961, the PSC dismissed the application, set aside the provisional approval, and ordered the confiscation of the jeepney plates [3]. The PSC found that neither its statistics nor transportation records showed that a CPC was ever issued to Vidal in Case No. 63708 [3]. Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration, presenting a "certified true copy" of a decision dated December 12, 1955, purportedly granting the CPC [4, 5]. The PSC en banc denied the motion, maintaining that diligent searches of dockets and records yielded no trace of the franchise [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a certified true copy of an alleged decision granting a franchise prevails over the official records of the Public Service Commission which show no such franchise exists. [6, 7]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that a certified true copy of an alleged "decision" cannot prevail over the records of the Public Service Commission unless it is shown that the latter's records are defective or incomplete, which was not the case here [7]. The Commission's diligent search revealed no docket entry, statistical record, or approved time schedule for the alleged franchise in Case No. 63708 [7]. Furthermore, the Court noted that the initial provisional approval was properly revoked as it was found to have been granted based on forgeries of the initials of recommending personnel [8]. Since there is no record of a CPC granted to Vidal, the sale to Baetiong cannot be approved, and the vehicles cannot operate under a non-existent franchise [9]. The appealed orders were affirmed [9].
