I. CAPTION
BALBINO PAMINTUAN and ILUMINADA STA. ANA v. HON. EMMANUEL M. MUÑOZ, THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF BULACAN and OLIMPIO MENDOZA, G.R. No. L-26331, March 15, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Pamintuan and Sta. Ana and private respondent Mendoza were parties to a civil case for quieting of title. They entered into an amicable settlement where petitioners recognized respondent's rights over logs and lumber and agreed to pay respondent Php 3,000.00. The settlement noted that respondent assigned this amount to Demetrio Fajardo [1, 2]. The trial court approved the settlement on October 9, 1964 [2].

On November 11, 1964, respondent moved for a writ of execution, alleging petitioners had not paid and that Fajardo had waived his rights to the assignment [3]. The court granted the motion on November 20, 1964. The sheriff levied on petitioners' properties, registered the notice of levy, and sent the notice of sale to petitioners by registered mail on December 28, 1964. Respondent acquired the properties at the auction [4]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, arguing they were denied notice and hearing before execution, that the execution varied from the judgment (which assigned payment to Fajardo), and that the levy was invalid for lack of notice [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioners are entitled to prior notice and hearing before the trial court can order execution of a final and executory judgment.
2. W/N the writ of execution was substantially at variance with the judgment regarding the assignment of payment.
3. W/N the levy was valid despite the alleged lack of service of notice of levy.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A judgment on a compromise is at once final and immediately executory. Once a judgment becomes final and executory, the prevailing party is entitled to execution as a matter of right, and its issuance becomes a ministerial duty of the court. Consequently, the judgment debtor need not be given advance notice of the application for execution nor be afforded a prior hearing [6, 7].

2. **NO.** The amicable settlement clearly stated that the petitioners agreed to pay the *defendant* (respondent). The assignment of the amount to Fajardo was a matter purely between Fajardo and the respondent. Since Fajardo waived his rights back to the respondent and petitioners had not paid anyone, the court did not abuse its discretion in ordering execution in favor of the respondent [8].

3. **YES.** The Sheriff's return showed the notice of levy was registered with the Register of Deeds. Even assuming petitioners were not served a copy of the notice of levy, this defect was cured by the service of the notice of sale upon the judgment debtors prior to the sale, which was done by registered mail on December 28, 1964. Citing *Philippine Bank of Commerce v. Macadaeg*, the Court held the levy was validly effected [9].

The petition is **DISMISSED** [10].
