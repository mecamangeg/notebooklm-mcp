I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR NATURALIZATION OF TAN KHE SHING alias TAN KEE SING. TAN KHE SHING alias TAN KEE SING v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-22390, February 29, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tan Khe Shing, a Chinese citizen residing in Boac, Marinduque, filed a petition for naturalization. The Court of First Instance of Marinduque granted the petition. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that the petitioner failed to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner by using the alias "Tan Kee Sing" without judicial authority, and that he lacked a sincere desire to embrace Filipino customs by enrolling his children in a Chinese school. Petitioner admitted using the alias in documents but claimed it was merely a misspelling of his name adopted since primary school. Upon review, the Supreme Court also noted that the petitioner resided in Manila for 2-3 years while attending the Anglo-Chinese School but failed to list this former residence in his petition. Furthermore, the petitioner only presented an affidavit from the editor of *Nueva Era* to prove publication, without positive evidence of the newspaper's general circulation in Marinduque.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner's use of the alias "Tan Kee Sing" without judicial authority is sufficient ground to deny naturalization.
2. W/N the failure to state a former place of residence in the petition affects the jurisdiction of the court.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The use of "Tan Kee Sing" is not merely a misspelling of "Tan Khe Shing" but constitutes a different name and alias in the contemplation of law, as the difference of even one letter may distinguish the identity of one person from another. The petitioner's use of this alias without judicial authority violates Commonwealth Act No. 142. This violation demonstrates improper conduct and is sufficient ground to deny the petition for naturalization (*Tan v. Republic; Khan v. Republic*).

2. **YES.** Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law requires the petitioner to state all former places of residence, including actual physical residence, to enable the public and the government to investigate the applicant's background and register valid protests. The petitioner's failure to mention his 2-3 year residence in Manila is a fatal defect that affects the court's jurisdiction to hear the case (*Chua Eng Go v. Republic*).

The decision of the lower court is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DISMISSED**.
