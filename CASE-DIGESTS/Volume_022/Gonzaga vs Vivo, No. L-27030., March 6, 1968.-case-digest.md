I. CAPTION
PABLO GONZAGA, ANGEL GONZAGA, AMADOR GONZAGA and ANDRES GONZAGA v. HON. MARTINIANO P. VIVO, G.R. No. L-27030, March 6, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners arrived in Manila on December 12, 1961, seeking admission as Filipino citizens, claiming to be the children of Roman Gonzaga, a Filipino. The Board of Special Inquiry admitted them, but the Board of Commissioners (BOC) reversed this decision on March 8, 1962, finding that petitioners failed to satisfactorily establish their citizenship and filiation. The BOC noted discrepancies in the birth dates of the alleged father in various documents and found the evidence of filiation to be merely self-serving.

Petitioners filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to stop their deportation. The parties submitted a stipulation of facts, one paragraph of which stated petitioners were "children of Roman Gonzaga." The CFI ruled in favor of petitioners, granting the writ and making the injunction permanent, effectively reversing the BOC based on said stipulation. Respondent Commissioner of Immigration appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in reversing the Board of Commissioners' findings on citizenship based on a stipulation of facts.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CFI's decision. Although the action was designated as prohibition, it was in reality a review of the Board of Commissioners' decision. The function of the court in such cases is limited to ascertaining whether the Board's findings are in accord with law, free from fraud, and supported by reasonable evidence.

The Court held that the CFI exceeded its powers as a reviewer of an administrative body by resolving a factual issue based on a stipulation of facts—specifically regarding the petitioners' filiation—which was never presented before the Board. The Court emphasized that petitioners’ alleged Filipino citizenship could not properly be stipulated upon after they were already ordered excluded by the BOC for failure to prove said citizenship [1, 2]. The BOC's findings were supported by evidence, as the documents presented (baptismal, birth, and landing certificates) contained conflicting birth dates for the alleged father, raising doubts about his identity, and there was a lack of competent evidence regarding filiation [3, 4].

The judgment appealed from was reversed and set aside, the petition for prohibition dismissed, and the preliminary injunction dissolved.
