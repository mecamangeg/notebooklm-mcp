I. CAPTION
MUNICIPALITY OF TACURONG v. ROSARIO ABRAGAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25314, February 10, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On October 9, 1956, Executive Proclamation No. 351 declared Lot No. 6001 in Tacurong, Cotabato, as reserved for a municipal site. Portions of the land were occupied by defendants Abragan, et al. On August 29, 1961, the Municipality of Tacurong filed a complaint for recovery of possession against the defendants, alleging they refused to vacate despite demands.

Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the complaint stated no cause of action. They cited a provision in the Proclamation requiring the Municipality to make "proper arrangements for the compensation and/or removal" of improvements made by occupants in good faith. Defendants claimed this was a condition precedent that the Municipality failed to allege. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cotabato took judicial notice of the Proclamation and dismissed the complaint for failing to allege said condition precedent. The Municipality appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in taking judicial notice of the Executive Proclamation.
2. W/N the complaint stated a cause of action despite failing to allege compliance with the compensation provision of the Proclamation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The trial court did not err. Executive Proclamations are among the matters valid subject of judicial notice under Section 1, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court (formerly Section 5, Rule 123) [1], [2].

2. **YES.** The complaint sufficiently stated a cause of action. The Supreme Court reiterated the rule that to determine whether a complaint states a cause of action, only facts alleged in the complaint, and no other, should be considered [3]. Furthermore, the Court held it was error to consider the offer of payment as a condition precedent. The Proclamation uses the phrase "compensation *and/or removal*," indicating that payment is not always mandatory. It is the burden of the defendants to prove their entitlement to compensation during the trial, rather than a requirement for the complaint's sufficiency [2].

The Order of dismissal is **REVERSED** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [4].
