I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DIONISIO, G.R. No. L-25513, March 27, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., Actg. C.J.

II. FACTS
On August 19, 1962, Rosauro Dionisio was caught in Manila offering and collecting bets for a "Special Daily Double Race" without authority from the Games and Amusement Board, in violation of Republic Act No. 3063 [1]. He was found in possession of P8.50, a racing program, and betting paraphernalia [1]. Upon arraignment, he initially pleaded not guilty but later withdrew his plea, waived his right to counsel, and pleaded guilty [2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila convicted him and sentenced him to one month imprisonment [2, 3]. Dionisio appealed, arguing that the penalty imposed is harsh and infringes the constitutional provision against excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishment [4-6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the penalty of one month imprisonment constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** Neither fines nor imprisonment constitute in themselves cruel and unusual punishment [4]. The constitutional stricture refers to penalties that are inhuman, barbarous, or shocking to the conscience (*Weems v. U.S.*), and the penalty imposed does not fall into this category [6]. Furthermore, mere severity does not make a punishment cruel or unusual; it must be "flagrantly and plainly oppressive" or "wholly disproportionate to the nature of the offense" (*People v. Estoista*) [7]. The Court emphasized that the determination of penalties to curb social evils like gambling—which is detrimental to the body politic—is primarily addressed to the legislative discretion [8].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [9].
