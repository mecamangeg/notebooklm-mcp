I. CAPTION
BERNARDO JOCSON and MARIA D. JOCSON v. REDENCION GLORIOSO, G.R. No. L-22686, January 30, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
A three-year-old boy was run over and killed by a passenger jeepney owned by Redencion Glorioso. The parents (Jocsons) filed two actions: (1) a civil case for damages based on *culpa aquiliana* against the owner and the driver; and (2) a criminal action for homicide thru reckless imprudence against the driver [1-3]. The civil case was dismissed by the trial court, holding that the defendants were not guilty of negligence "in conscience," and the appeal was dismissed for failure to pay docket fees [1, 2, 4].

However, in the criminal case, the driver was convicted and ordered to indemnify the heirs P6,000.00, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency [1, 2, 4]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the civil indemnity despite the driver raising the issue of the prior dismissal of the civil case [1, 2, 5]. When the writ of execution against the driver was returned unsatisfied due to insolvency, the Jocsons filed the present action against Glorioso to enforce her subsidiary liability under Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code [1, 2, 6]. Glorioso argued that the action was barred by the previous judgment dismissing the *culpa aquiliana* case [6]. The trial court ruled in favor of the Jocsons [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the previous dismissal of the civil action based on *culpa aquiliana* bars the subsequent action to enforce the employer's subsidiary liability under Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The dismissal of the action based on *culpa aquiliana* does not preclude the application of Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code. The Court held that the two cases involve different remedies: one is based on the Civil Code (quasi-delict), while the other is based on the Revised Penal Code (subsidiary liability for a felony) [7, 8]. Citing *Diana v. Batangas Transportation Co.*, the Court distinguished the nature of the reliefs, establishing that they are not identical [8, 9].

Under Article 103, once there is a final conviction for a felony committed by an employee in the discharge of their duties, the employer is subsidiarily liable [7, 10]. As established in *Martinez v. Barredo*, a judgment of conviction is binding and conclusive upon the person subsidiarily liable in the absence of collusion [11]. Furthermore, the Court of Appeals had already affirmed the civil indemnity in the criminal case, rejecting the defense of bar by prior judgment; the lower court could not have ruled otherwise, as it has no authority to set aside or overrule a final decision of a superior court [12-14].

**Decision affirmed.** [15]
