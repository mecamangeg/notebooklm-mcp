I. CAPTION
ALEJANDRO REYES v. ANATALIO REYES and COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, G.R. No. L-28476, January 31, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alejandro Reyes (NP) and respondent Anatalio Reyes (LP) were candidates for Mayor of Magallanes, Cavite in the November 14, 1967 elections [1]. On November 21, 1967, the Municipal Board of Canvassers proclaimed Anatalio Reyes as the winner [2]. Petitioner filed an election protest with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cavite on December 4, 1967 [2]. Subsequently, without disclosing the pending protest, petitioner filed a petition with the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to annul the proclamation, which the Commission initially granted on December 6, 1967 [2]. Anatalio Reyes moved for reconsideration, arguing that the pending election protest in the CFI involving the same parties and election precluded the COMELEC from intervening [3]. On December 29, 1967, the COMELEC granted the reconsideration and reinstated the proclamation, ruling that it must leave the disposition of the case to the CFI [4, 5]. Petitioner filed this certiorari petition to nullify the COMELEC's December 29 resolution [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the COMELEC retains jurisdiction to annul a proclamation after an election protest involving the same election has been filed with the Court of First Instance.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that upon the filing of an election protest or a petition for *quo warranto* in the proper Court of First Instance against a proclaimed candidate who has already assumed office, said court acquires exclusive authority to inquire into the validity of the candidate's title and proclamation [6, 7]. Citing the doctrine in *Acain v. Board of Canvassers* (L-16445, May 23, 1960), the Court reasoned that it would be conducive to confusion and conflict of authority if the COMELEC were considered to have residual power to interfere with a pending election protest [8, 9]. The Supreme Court and the COMELEC must respect and uphold the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance once it has attached [10, 11]. Therefore, the COMELEC correctly reinstated the proclamation and deferred to the CFI's jurisdiction [12].

Petition dismissed [13].
