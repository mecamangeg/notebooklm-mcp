I. CAPTION
CALTEX (PHILIPPINES), INC., petitioner, vs. ACTING COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, respondent, G.R. No. L-24619, February 26, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
From November 1960 to April 1961, petitioner Caltex (Philippines), Inc. imported crude oil and various articles through the ports of Batangas and Davao [1, 2]. Pursuant to Department of Finance Order No. 22, the Bureau of Customs added the 25% margin fee imposed by Republic Act No. 2609 to the peso value of the importations when converting them from dollars [3]. This calculation increased the tax base for determining the customs duties and special import tax due [3]. Caltex paid the amounts under protest, arguing that the margin fee should not be included in the conversion rate, and sought a refund of P699,537.25 [2]. The Collectors of Customs denied the protests, and the Commissioner of Customs affirmed the denials [2]. On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) dismissed the petition, ruling that the margin fee is properly part of the rate of exchange [2, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the 25% margin fee should be included in the conversion rate of the imported articles' value for purposes of assessing customs duties and special import tax.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals [5].

The Court ruled that under Section 204 of the Tariff and Customs Code, the value of imports quoted in foreign currency must be converted to Philippine currency at the "current rate of exchange" specified by the Central Bank [6]. This phrase does not refer to the par value of the peso under the Coinage Act, but to the value fixed by the Central Bank [6].

A margin levy is a form of exchange restriction designed to discourage imports and stabilize the currency by curtailing excessive demand on international reserves [7]. Its main function is to control the exchange rate without altering the par value [7]. Therefore, by its nature, the margin levy is part of the rate of exchange as fixed by the government [7]. The Court relied on *Chamber of Agriculture and Natural Resources of the Philippines v. Central Bank*, which upheld the legality of the margin levy as a monetary measure [8].

Regarding the special import tax under R.A. 1394, the Court held that Section 3 of said Act is *in pari materia* with Section 201 of the Tariff and Customs Code, as both share the same source (Philippine Tariff Act of 1909) [9]. Thus, the same conversion rate, inclusive of the 25% margin fee, applies [9].

Judgment affirmed [5].
