I. CAPTION
LUCRECIO DE GUZMAN and ADELA DE LA CRUZ v. HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL, VILFRAN TRANSPORTATION CO., and ARTEMIO AGUILAR, G.R. No. L-24480, January 16, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners De Guzman and De la Cruz filed a complaint for damages in the CFI of Manila against respondents Vilfran Transportation Co. and its driver, Aguilar, following the death of petitioners' son who fell from respondents' bus [1]. Respondents filed a Motion to Dismiss on April 28, 1964, which was one day beyond the reglementary period [2]. Upon petitioners' motion, Judge Cloribel declared respondents in default and allowed petitioners to present evidence ex parte [2].

On August 11, 1964, the trial court rendered a default judgment awarding petitioners approximately P100,000 in damages [3, 4]. Respondents received the decision on August 17, 1964, and filed a "Petition for Relief from Judgment" on August 28, 1964, attaching their answer and affidavits of merit [3, 5]. Petitioners moved for execution, arguing that respondents had not appealed within 30 days [5]. Judge Cloribel denied execution, set aside the default judgment, and admitted respondents' answer [6]. Petitioners filed the present action for certiorari, mandamus, and prohibition, alleging the Judge committed grave abuse of discretion and asserting the default judgment was immediately executory [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial judge committed grave abuse of discretion in setting aside the default judgment and denying the motion for execution.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial judge acted in consonance with the tenets of fair play and promoted the ends of justice [4]. Although labeled as a "Petition for Relief," the pleading filed by respondents on August 28, 1964—only 11 days after receiving the decision—was in fact a Motion for New Trial [8]. Under Section 1, Rule 37 of the Rules of Court, a motion for new trial suspends the running of the period to appeal [8]. Thus, the decision had not yet become final and executory when the court acted on it.

Furthermore, a judgment by default is not immediately executory; it is appealable [9]. Under the Revised Rules of Court effective January 1, 1964, a motion to set aside the order of default is no longer even a prerequisite to appeal [9]. The Court also noted that the delay in filing the motion to dismiss was only one day due to excusable negligence, and a decision in the related criminal case had already found that the death was accidental and not due to the driver's negligence [4].

Petition dismissed [10].
