I. CAPTION
JUANA T. VDA. DE RACHO v. MUNICIPALITY OF ILAGAN, G.R. No. L-23542, January 2, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Manuel Racho was employed as a market cleaner by the Municipality of Ilagan, Isabela from July 1, 1954, until his resignation on January 6, 1960. Throughout his employment, he received a monthly salary ranging from P55.00 to P60.00. After his death, his widow, Juana T. Vda. de Racho, filed a claim for salary differentials based on the Minimum Wage Law. The Court of First Instance of Isabela ruled in favor of the plaintiff. The Municipality appealed directly to the Supreme Court, raising the sole defense that its lack of available funds and expected revenue validly exempted it from complying with the Minimum Wage Law [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipality of Ilagan is exempted from paying the statutory minimum wage due to lack of funds.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court rejected the Municipality's defense and affirmed the lower court's decision. Relying on *Rivera v. Colago* (G.R. No. L-12323), the Court ruled that "lack of funds of a municipality does not excuse it from paying the statutory minimum wages to its employees, which, after all, is a mandatory statutory obligation of the municipality" [3]. To accept such a defense would render the Minimum Wage Law futile and defeat its purpose [3, 4].

The Court further noted that the Minimum Wage Law (Republic Act 602) took effect regarding government employees in 1952, and the Municipality should have taken steps to implement it immediately [5, 6]. To excuse the Municipality now would allow it to benefit from its own nonfeasance. The Municipality's remedy is not exemption from the law, but to upgrade its tax collection machinery or forego non-essential expenditures [6].

The appealed judgment is AFFIRMED [7].
