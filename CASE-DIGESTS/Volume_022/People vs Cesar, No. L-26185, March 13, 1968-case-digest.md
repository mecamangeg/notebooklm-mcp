I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. WILFORIANO CESAR alias JUNIOR, G.R. No. L-26185, March 13, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Wilforiano Cesar, a student at St. Anthony's Academy, stabbed the Acting Principal Teacher, Segundo Sarce, Jr., with a knife after classes, resulting in Sarce's death [1]. Cesar was charged with direct assault with murder but, with the fiscal's conformity, pleaded guilty to the complex crime of direct assault with homicide [2, 3]. He invoked the privileged mitigating circumstance of minority (being 17 years old) and the ordinary mitigating circumstance of a spontaneous plea of guilty [3]. The trial court convicted him and imposed an indeterminate penalty of 12 years and 1 day to 14 years, 8 months and 1 day of *reclusion temporal* [4]. Cesar appealed, questioning the correctness of the penalty imposed [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court correctly computed the penalty for a complex crime committed by a minor who pleaded guilty.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court erred in its method of imposing the penalty.

The proper method for determining the penalty is as follows:
1.  **Start with the penalty provided by the Revised Penal Code** for the more serious crime in the complex crime (Art. 48). Here, Homicide is punished by *reclusion temporal* [5, 6].
2.  **Apply the privileged mitigating circumstance of minority** (Art. 68, par. 2) to lower the penalty by one degree. The penalty immediately inferior to *reclusion temporal* is *prision mayor* [6, 7].
3.  **Apply the complex crime rule** (Art. 48), which mandates the penalty be imposed in its maximum period. Thus, the penalty is *prision mayor* in its maximum period [6, 7].
4.  **Apply the ordinary mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty** (Art. 64). Since there are no aggravating circumstances, the penalty should be imposed within the minimum range of the maximum period determined in the previous step [7].

Under the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the maximum term must be within *prision mayor* maximum, and the minimum term must be within the penalty next lower in degree, which is *prision correccional* [6].

The judgment was **MODIFIED** as to the personal penalty, sentencing the accused to an indeterminate penalty of not less than six (6) years of *prision correccional* to not more than ten (10) years and eight (8) months of *prision mayor* [8].
