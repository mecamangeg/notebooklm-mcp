I. CAPTION
TACLOBAN ELECTRIC & ICE PLANTS CO., INC. v. COMMISSIONER ENRIQUE MEDINA and PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-24362, February 26, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tacloban Electric & Ice Plants Co., Inc. held a certificate of public convenience. Following a resolution by the Municipal Board of Tacloban City and a request from the Acting Commissioner of Customs, the Public Service Commission (PSC) ordered the petitioner to reduce its electric rates by 10% in a decision dated May 3, 1963 [1, 2]. Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration. On February 3, 1965, the PSC issued an order denying the motion. This order was signed by Commissioner Medina and two Associate Commissioners, while three other Associate Commissioners dissented, resulting in a 3-to-3 tie vote [3]. Petitioner argued that the denial was improper because the Public Service Act requires the concurrence of at least four Commissioners to resolve a motion for reconsideration [4]. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus to annul the orders and enjoin the enforcement of the rate reduction [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the PSC order denying the Motion for Reconsideration is valid despite having only three concurring votes.
2. W/N the PSC order reducing rates is immediately executory pending the Motion for Reconsideration.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The order denying the Motion for Reconsideration is void. Section 3, paragraph 3 of the Public Service Act, as amended by R.A. 2677, expressly provides that "the concurrence of at least four commissioners shall be necessary for the promulgation of a final decision or order resolving such motion for reconsideration" [6]. A 3-to-3 vote constitutes a tie, not a denial. In the event of a tie, the Commission should not promulgate a decision but must refer the matter to the Secretary of Justice to designate judges or lawyers to sit temporarily as Commissioners to resolve the impasse [7, 8].

2. **YES.** The enforcement of the rate reduction was proper. Section 33 of the Public Service Act states that "All orders of the Commission... prescribing rates to be charged shall immediately be operative" [8]. The Commission has no discretion to suspend the effectivity of an order prescribing rates; only the Supreme Court possesses the power to do so [9].

Accordingly, the orders of February 3 and March 12, 1965 are ANNULLED, and the case is REMANDED to the Public Service Commission for further deliberation, without prejudice to the immediate effectivity of the May 3, 1963 decision [9].
