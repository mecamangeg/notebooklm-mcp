I. CAPTION
NAZARIO EQUIZABAL v. HON. APOLONIO G. MALENIZA and THE HON. MEMBERS OF THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF CAMARINES SUR, G.R. No. L-24432, January 12, 1968, 22 SCRA 27, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Nazario Equizabal, the Municipal Mayor of Buhi, Camarines Sur, was suspended by Respondent Governor Maleniza on February 5, 1965, pending Administrative Case No. 3 for oppression and misconduct [1]. On February 16, 1965, Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the charges, which the Provincial Board denied on March 2, 1965 [2]. Following various postponements, Petitioner received a second suspension order on March 12, 1965, relative to a new charge, Administrative Case No. 4 [3].

Petitioner filed for mandamus to compel his reinstatement, arguing that the 30-day limit for preventive suspension in Case No. 3 had expired on March 11, 1965 (excluding only the 5-day postponement of the hearing) [4, 5]. He claimed he was entitled to reinstatement effective March 12 [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the time consumed to resolve a motion to dismiss filed by the accused should be excluded from the computation of the 30-day preventive suspension period.

IV. RULING
**YES.** (The time is excluded, meaning the suspension period had not expired). The Court ruled that under Section 2189 of the Revised Administrative Code, the preventive suspension runs only when the respondent municipal official does nothing to hinder the provincial board from immediately proceeding to dispose of the administrative case on its merits [6, 7].

The 14-day delay (February 16 to March 2) caused by the Petitioner's filing of a motion to dismiss is imputable to him because it diverted the Board's attention from the merits of the case [7]. Delays due to the "fault, neglect, or request of the accused" are not counted in the 30-day suspension limit [6]. Consequently, the suspension period had not yet lapsed. Furthermore, reinstatement was not possible due to the valid second suspension order issued in Administrative Case No. 4 [8].

Petition dismissed [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Sanchez, Castro, and Fernando concurred in the result [9].
