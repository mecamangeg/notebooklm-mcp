I. CAPTION
RAFAEL FALCOTELO, et al. v. HON. MACARIO ASISTIO, as Mayor of Caloocan City, G.R. No. L-28459, January 17, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners filed an original action for certiorari and prohibition to annul the Public Notice (*Paunawa*) dated November 26, 1967, issued by respondent Mayor Asistio [1], [2]. The notice directed that for the purposes of the barrio elections on January 14, 1968, Bagong Barrio of Caloocan City would embrace the remaining portions of Barrios Pacita, Manotoc, Galino, and San Jose (which remained after their mother barrios became part of Quezon City) [2]. Petitioners alleged that these portions were outside the legal boundaries of Bagong Barrio [2]. In his answer, respondent disputed this factual allegation and further averred that he "has not and does not intend to enforce and execute said Public Notice" [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for certiorari and prohibition has become moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the case is **moot and academic**. The respondent expressly averred in his answer that he did not intend to enforce or execute the questioned Public Notice [2]. Furthermore, the Court noted that the petitioners' claim regarding the boundaries was factually disputed by the respondent, and without an established factual premise, no legal conclusion could be drawn [2].

The petition was dismissed [3].
