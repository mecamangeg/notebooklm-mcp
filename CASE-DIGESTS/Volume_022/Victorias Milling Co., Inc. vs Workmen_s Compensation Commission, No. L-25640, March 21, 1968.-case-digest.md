I. CAPTION
VICTORIAS MILLING CO., INC. v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and VICENTE DEL ROSARIO, G.R. No. L-25640, March 21, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Vicente del Rosario was employed by petitioner Victorias Milling Co. since 1923, eventually becoming a river pump operator. His duties required him to dive underwater several times a week, often at night, to clean clogged pipes and screeners. He was hospitalized for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in 1953 and 1954. On August 25, 1955, the company separated him from service due to PTB.

On January 19, 1960, nearly four and a half years after his separation, del Rosario filed a claim for compensation. The company filed its "Employer's Report of Accident or Sickness" only on March 7, 1960. The hearing officer ruled in favor of del Rosario, finding his sickness was aggravated by or resulted from his employment. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed the decision. Petitioner appealed, arguing the claim was barred by the two-month period for filing under Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act and that PTB is not an occupational disease.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claim is barred by the failure to file within the two-month period prescribed by Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act.
2. W/N the employer renounced its right to controvert the claim.
3. W/N the claimant's illness (tuberculosis) is compensable.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court reiterated the doctrine that failure to comply with the requirements of Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act regarding the giving of notice and filing of a claim within the prescribed time is non-jurisdictional [1].

2. **YES.** The petitioner's failure to file its employer's report and notice of controversion within ten days after knowledge of the accident, as required by Section 45 of the Act, amounted to a statutory renunciation of its right to assert non-jurisdictional defenses [2].

3. **YES.** The Court affirmed the WCC's findings that the illness was contracted or aggravated during employment. The Court noted that findings of fact by the WCC are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence [3]. The nature of del Rosario's work, which involved night shifts, exposure to cold water, and heat, had a debilitating effect that lowered his resistance to tuberculosis [4, 5]. Even if the disease was dormant, if the work reactivated it or constituted its original cause, the employee is entitled to compensation [5].

The judgment of the Workmen's Compensation Commission is **AFFIRMED** in toto [6].
