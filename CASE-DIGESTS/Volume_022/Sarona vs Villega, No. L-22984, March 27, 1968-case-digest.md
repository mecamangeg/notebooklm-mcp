I. CAPTION
MARGARITO SARONA, et al. v. FELIPE VILLEGAS and RAMONA CARILLO, G.R. No. L-22984, March 27, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On January 28, 1963, petitioners (Sarona, et al.) filed a complaint styled as "Unlawful Detainer" against respondents in the Municipal Court of Padada, Davao [1]. The complaint alleged that on April 1, 1958, respondents entered Lot "F", constructed a house, and remained in possession, and that a demand to vacate was made only on December 28, 1962 [2]. Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing the action was actually for forcible entry and was filed beyond the one-year reglementary period from the 1958 entry [3]. The Municipal Court denied the motion and ruled in favor of petitioners [4]. On appeal, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao dismissed the case, ruling it was a forcible entry case filed out of time [4, 5]. Facts revealed at trial showed respondents entered the land in 1958 without the petitioners' consent or permission, and refused petitioners' request not to build their house there [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipal Court had jurisdiction over the case as one of unlawful detainer.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CFI's order of dismissal [8]. The Court held that the nature of the defendant's entry determines the cause of action: if entry is illegal from the beginning, it is forcible entry; if entry is legal but possession becomes illegal later (e.g., upon expiration of right), it is unlawful detainer [9].

While the complaint was vague, the evidence showed respondents' entry was illegal at inception (without consent) [7]. The Court rejected the claim of "tolerance," ruling that for unlawful detainer to exist, tolerance must be present **right from the start** of possession [10, 11]. A plaintiff cannot allow a forcible entry to persist for years and then claim unlawful detainer to bypass the one-year prescription period [11]. Since the entry was forcible (illegal) in 1958, the suit filed in 1963 was beyond the one-year period allowed by Section 1, Rule 70 of the Revised Rules of Court [12, 13]. The remedy should have been an *accion publiciana* filed in the Court of First Instance [8].

Petition denied; order affirmed.
