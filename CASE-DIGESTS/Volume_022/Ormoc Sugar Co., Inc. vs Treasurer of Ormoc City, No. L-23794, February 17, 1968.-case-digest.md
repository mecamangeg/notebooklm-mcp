I. CAPTION
ORMOC SUGAR COMPANY, INC. v. TREASURER OF ORMOC CITY, THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF ORMOC CITY, HON. ESTEBAN C. CONEJOS, as Mayor of Ormoc City, and ORMOC CITY, G.R. No. L-23794, February 17, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On January 29, 1964, the Municipal Board of Ormoc City passed Ordinance No. 4, imposing a 1% municipal tax on "any and all productions of centrifugal sugar milled at the Ormoc Sugar Company, Inc., in Ormoc City" for every export sale to the United States and other foreign countries [1]. Ormoc Sugar Company, Inc. paid P12,087.50 under protest and subsequently filed a complaint before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte, alleging that the ordinance was unconstitutional for violating the equal protection clause and the rule of uniformity of taxation [2]. The CFI upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance, ruling that the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. 2264) had broadened the city's taxing power [3]. The petitioner appealed directly to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the ordinance violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to interest on the tax refund.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The ordinance violates the equal protection clause (Sec. 1[5], Art. III, Constitution) because the classification used is not reasonable [6]. For a classification to be reasonable, it must: (1) be based on substantial distinctions which make real differences; (2) be germane to the purpose of the law; (3) apply not only to present conditions but also to future conditions which are substantially identical to those of the present; and (4) apply only to those who belong to the same class [6]. The Court held that the ordinance failed these requisites because it taxed *only* the centrifugal sugar produced and exported by the *Ormoc Sugar Company, Inc.* and no other [7]. Although the petitioner was the only sugar central in the city at the time, the ordinance was singular and exclusive; it did not provide terms applicable to future conditions, such as the establishment of a new sugar central [7].

2. **NO.** The petitioner is not entitled to interest on the refund. The taxes were not arbitrarily collected because, at the time of collection, the ordinance provided a sufficient basis for the levy and was presumed constitutional until declared otherwise [8].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**. The challenged ordinance is declared unconstitutional, and the defendants-appellees are ordered to refund the P12,087.50 paid by the plaintiff-appellant [8].
