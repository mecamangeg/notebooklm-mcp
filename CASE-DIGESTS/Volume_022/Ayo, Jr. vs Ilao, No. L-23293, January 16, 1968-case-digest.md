I. CAPTION
REV. FR. LUIS R. AYO, JR. v. HON. MELQUIADES G. ILAO and ERNESTO F. JALGALADO, G.R. No. L-23293, January 16, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rev. Fr. Ayo, Jr., the parish priest of Capalonga, Camarines Norte, applied for a permit from the Bureau of Private Schools to open a first-year high school [1]. Respondent Jalgalado, Director of the Capalonga Institute (an existing school in the same municipality), opposed the application [1]. The application was initially denied because the school building was not yet completed [1]. Despite this, Fr. Ayo advertised the opening of the parochial school and continued construction [2].

Jalgalado filed a complaint for damages in the Court of First Instance, alleging that due to Ayo's advertisements, "not a single student" enrolled in his institute for the first year [2]. Respondent Judge Ilao issued a writ prohibiting the construction of Ayo's building [2]. Fr. Ayo filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, arguing Jalgalado lacked a cause of action [2]. During the pendency of the case, the Department of Education eventually granted Fr. Ayo a temporary permit to operate [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N respondent Jalgalado had a cause of action to sue and enjoin the petitioner from opening a competing school.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the authority granted to Jalgalado to operate a school did not confer upon him any exclusive right to operate to the exclusion of others [4]. Consequently, he had no right to sue the petitioner for announcing the opening of a school that might compete with his own [4].

If the petitioner lacked the necessary permit at the time of the announcement, the respondent's remedy was to report the matter to the Bureau of Private Schools, not to file a suit, as the petitioner had no legal obligation towards him [4, 5]. Furthermore, the allegation that no students enrolled in respondent's school did not suffice to constitute a cause of action for damages [6, 7]. The Court also noted that since Fr. Ayo had the requisite building permit, Judge Ilao committed grave abuse of discretion in enjoining the construction [7].

The writ of preliminary injunction issued by Judge Ilao is **ANNULLED**, and the preliminary injunction issued by the Supreme Court is made permanent [8].
