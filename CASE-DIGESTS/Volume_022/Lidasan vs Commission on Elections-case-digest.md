I. CAPTION
TAHIR LIDASAN v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, MUNICIPAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF PARANG, COTABATO, and SANSALUNA BIRUAR, G.R. No. L-28473, March 6, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tahir Lidasan was a mayoralty candidate for Parang, Cotabato in the 1967 elections against Respondent Sansaluna Biruar [1]. On December 28, 1967, the Municipal Board of Canvassers initially rejected the returns of four precincts, citing the statistical improbability rule in *Lagumbay v. Climaco* [2]. However, upon the order of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), the Board reversed itself on December 29, 1967, and included the returns in the canvass [2]. Lidasan immediately filed this special civil action for certiorari to assail the COMELEC order [1, 2]. While this case was pending, on January 9, 1968, Lidasan filed an election protest in the Court of First Instance of Cotabato based on alleged fraud and irregularities [3, 4]. Respondent Biruar moved to dismiss the certiorari petition, arguing that the filing of the election protest rendered the case moot [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for certiorari should be dismissed due to the subsequent filing of an election protest.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that a special civil action of certiorari does not lie where a plain and speedy remedy exists in the ordinary course of law [5, 6]. By filing an election protest subsequent to the institution of the certiorari suit, the petitioner resorted to an ordinary remedy [5]. A litigant cannot avail of both a special civil action and an ordinary remedy simultaneously [5, 6]. The record showed that the petitioner freely resorted to the election protest and failed to demonstrate that said remedy was not speedy or adequate for his purpose [4]. Additionally, the Court noted on the merits that there was no grave abuse of discretion by the COMELEC because the doctrine in *Lagumbay* did not apply, as the returns in question did not show 100% voting for one party and zero for the other [7].

The petition for certiorari is hereby dismissed [8].
