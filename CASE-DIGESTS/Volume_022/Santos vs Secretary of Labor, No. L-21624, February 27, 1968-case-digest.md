I. CAPTION
SEGUNDO SANTOS v. SECRETARY OF LABOR, RAOUL M. INOCENTES, Commissioner of Civil Service, RICARDO TIONGCO and CASHIER, Regional Office No. 4, G.R. No. L-21624, February 27, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Segundo Santos, a Labor Conciliator I, was issued a promotional appointment as Labor Conciliator II on August 24, 1960, effective September 1, 1960. The Civil Service Commission (CSC) approved this appointment on May 14, 1962. However, in June 1962, the Respondent Secretary of Labor appointed Ricardo Tiongco to the same position. Santos demanded the revocation of Tiongco's appointment and the payment of his salary differentials, but the request was rejected.

On August 20, 1962, three days before his compulsory retirement, Santos filed a petition for mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. While the case was pending, Santos died on February 14, 1963. His heirs moved to substitute his Estate as the petitioner. The respondents moved to dismiss, arguing that the claim to public office is personal and was extinguished by his death. The CFI dismissed the petition. The Estate appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Estate of the deceased petitioner may be substituted to continue the suit for salary differentials.
2. W/N the respondents are barred from presenting evidence on the alleged "recall" of the petitioner's appointment after securing a dismissal on legal grounds.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While a public office is personal and does not pass to heirs (*Actio personalis moritur cum persona*), the claim in this case includes salary differentials, which is a money claim. Jurisdiction over the case had already attached before the petitioner's death and continues until termination. Death does not dislodge jurisdiction over a subsisting money claim [1-3]. Therefore, the Estate of Segundo Santos may properly substitute him to prosecute the claim for the salary owed [1, 3].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the respondents, by choosing to file a motion to dismiss on legal grounds (death of the party) rather than going to trial on the merits, effectively waived their right to present evidence regarding the alleged "recall" of Santos' appointment [4-6]. Citing *Moody, Aronson & Co. v. Hotel Bilbao*, the Court held that a defendant cannot be permitted to gamble with court proceedings by securing a dismissal on a technicality and then, upon reversal, attempt to return to the lower court to present evidence [6-8]. Since the original appointment was approved by the CSC, it was complete and valid (*Mitra v. Subido*) [9-11].

**Order reversed.** The Respondents are directed to pay the Estate of Segundo Santos the sum of P761.68 in salary differentials [12].
