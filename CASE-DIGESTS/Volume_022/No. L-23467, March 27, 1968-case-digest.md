I. CAPTION
AMALGAMATED LABORERS' ASSOCIATION and/or FELISBERTO M. JAVIER for Himself and as General President, ATTY. JOSE UR. CARBONELL, ET AL. v. HON. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and ATTY. LEONARDO C. FERNANDEZ, G.R. No. L-23467, March 27, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
In 1956, Amalgamated Laborers' Association and 47 of its members filed a complaint for unfair labor practices against Binalbagan Sugar Central Company, Inc. (Biscom) in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). They were represented by Attorneys Leonardo Fernandez and Jose Carbonell, who filed pleadings under the firm name "Fernandez & Carbonell." On November 13, 1962, the CIR ruled in favor of the complainants, awarding reinstatement and back wages computed at P79,755.22.

A dispute arose regarding attorney's fees. Atty. Fernandez filed a lien claiming 25% of the award, alleging the laborers agreed to a 30% contingent fee, which he voluntarily reduced to 25%. Atty. Carbonell opposed, claiming a verbal agreement existed to split the 30% fee equally among himself, Fernandez, and the Union President, Felisberto Javier. On March 19, 1964, the CIR ordered the deposit of 25% of the back wages as fees and awarded the entire amount (P19,938.81) solely to Atty. Fernandez. Petitioners appealed, questioning the CIR's jurisdiction over the fee dispute and the validity of the award.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes over attorney's fees.
2. W/N the agreement to share attorney's fees with the Union President is valid.
3. W/N the stipulated attorney's fees were reasonable.
4. W/N Atty. Carbonell is entitled to a share of the fees.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The CIR has jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes over attorney's fees as an incident to the main case over which it validly assumed jurisdiction. A grant of jurisdiction implies the necessary incidental powers to effectuate it. To require a separate suit for fees would result in a multiplicity of suits, which is abhorred by the rules [1], [2], [3].

2. **NO.** An agreement allowing a union president to share in attorney's fees is illegal and immoral. Canon 34 of Legal Ethics allows division of fees only with another lawyer based on a division of service or responsibility. The union president is not the attorney for the laborers and may not share in the legal fees [4].

3. **NO.** The stipulated 30% fee is excessive and unconscionable. The complainants are mere wage earners earning P4.20 to P5.00 daily who were deprived of pay for a long period. Attorney's fees are subject to court supervision and must be reasonable (Canon 13, Code of Legal Ethics). The Court determined that 25% is a reasonable compensation for the legal services rendered [5], [6].

4. **YES.** Atty. Carbonell is entitled to a share. The records show the lawyers acted as an association ("Fernandez & Carbonell") and Carbonell rendered significant services, including filing motions after the professional relationship between the lawyers deteriorated. The 25% fee must be shared between Atty. Fernandez and Atty. Carbonell.

The CIR order is **SET ASIDE**, and the case is **REMANDED** to the CIR to determine the respective shares of the two lawyers in the 25% fee [7].
