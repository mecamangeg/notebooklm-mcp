I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PRUDENCIO OPINIANO, ET AL.**, G.R. Nos. L-18546 & L-18547, January 29, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Prudencio Opiniano was the "Supreme Leader" of the religious organization *Filipinasnon Kabus Magu-uma*, and Florencio Bautista was a general missionary. Both were accused of *estafa* in Samar. Aware of a standing warrant of arrest, Opiniano gathered his followers in Matag-ub, Leyte, on March 25, 1960. He exhorted them to challenge the Constabulary (PC) soldiers, claiming the soldiers were hired assassins and that the members were invulnerable to bullets. He instructed that his signal to attack would be raising his cane to his shoulder.

Later that day, Pfc. Luis Meroy and Pfc. Remy Parambita intercepted the group to serve the warrant. Despite the soldiers identifying themselves, Opiniano refused arrest and gave the signal. His followers, armed with bolos and canes, attacked. Meroy was killed, and Parambita was seriously wounded. Ten members were arrested and executed extrajudicial confessions. The Court of First Instance convicted them of the complex crimes of murder and frustrated murder with assault upon an agent of a person in authority. Five accused withdrew their appeals; the remaining five (Opiniano, Bautista, et al.) appealed, claiming their confessions were coerced and that the soldiers fired first.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the extrajudicial confessions of the accused are admissible.
2. W/N the guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court found the extrajudicial confessions were executed freely and voluntarily. They contained details, such as the organization's constitution and specific branches, which only the declarants could furnish and were unlikely to be fabricated by investigators. Furthermore, the statements contained both inculpatory and exculpatory facts, which are clear badges of spontaneity and voluntariness (citing *People v. Castro*). The allegations of maltreatment were deemed a "last-ditch attempt to exculpation" as they were inconsistent and were not reported to proper authorities or physicians earlier.

2. **YES.** The defense version that the soldiers fired shots from a distance of only four meters without hitting anyone (except an alleged slight injury to one person not presented) was rejected as contrary to the ordinary course of nature. The Court held that Opiniano and Bautista had a clear motive to avoid arrest for *estafa*. Conspiracy was evident as the accused acted in concert and unison, obeying Opiniano's signal to attack the agents of authority.

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Fernando, J.**, concurs in the result.
