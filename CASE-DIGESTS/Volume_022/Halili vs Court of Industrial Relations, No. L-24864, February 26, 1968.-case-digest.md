I. CAPTION
FORTUNATO F. HALILI, doing business under the name and style HALILI TRANSIT (Substituted by EMILIA DE VERA VDA. DE HALILI) v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and HALILI BUS DRIVERS and CONDUCTORS UNION (PTGWO), G.R. No. L-24864, February 26, 1968, 22 SCRA 96, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On August 20, 1958, the Halili Bus Drivers and Conductors Union filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) charging petitioner Fortunato Halili with violating Commonwealth Act No. 444 (Eight-Hour Labor Law). The Union alleged that Halili deducted time spent on non-driving tasks (e.g., gassing up, taking buses from the carbarn, waiting intervals, and minor repairs) from the employees' compensable work hours [1].

On August 7, 1961, the CIR rendered a decision finding Halili guilty of violating C.A. No. 444 and ordered the computation of compensable hours from October 1, 1956 [2]. Halili sought clarification, and the CIR affirmed the decision en banc on April 6, 1962, while remanding the case for the judicial determination of union membership [3]. Halili did not appeal this decision, and it became final and executory [4].

On April 7, 1965, the CIR issued an order directing its Court Examiner to compute the compensable hours from January 1, 1961, to the present [4]. Halili appealed this order, arguing that the original August 7, 1961 decision was incomplete and "interlocutory," and thus could not be enforced [5], [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR decision dated August 7, 1961 is interlocutory and therefore unenforceable.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the decision is not interlocutory but final and conclusive. An "interlocutory" order intervenes between the commencement and end of a suit to decide a point, without finally adjudicating the whole controversy [7].

In this case, the August 7, 1961 decision (affirmed en banc in 1962) definitively settled the main issue: Halili's guilt in violating the Eight-Hour Labor Law [8]. Since Halili failed to appeal within the reglementary period, the finding of fact became final and is no longer subject to review [8]. The case had already reached the execution stage, leaving only the computation of exact amounts and the determination of specific union membership to be resolved [9]. The Court emphasized that a party cannot inconsistently attack a decision as interlocutory after allowing it to become final [9].

The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's order and resolution, directing the lower court to proceed with the judicial determination of union membership and the computation of compensable hours [10].
