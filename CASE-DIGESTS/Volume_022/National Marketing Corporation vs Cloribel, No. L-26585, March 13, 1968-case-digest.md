I. CAPTION
NATIONAL MARKETING CORPORATION, JOVENAL D. ALMENDRAS, and SERAPIO DATOC v. HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL and VILTRA COMPANY AND/OR GERMAN E. VILLANUEVA, G.R. No. L-26585, March 13, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent VILTRA Company (VILTRA) filed an action for mandamus with preliminary injunction against petitioner National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO) in the Court of First Instance of Manila. VILTRA sought to compel NAMARCO to comply with an alleged contract dated November 24, 1965, specifically to open an irrevocable foreign letter of credit for the importation of wire rods. Respondent Judge Cloribel issued a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction ordering NAMARCO to immediately open said letter of credit. NAMARCO opposed, arguing VILTRA was not qualified under NAMARCO's administrative orders and had failed to open the required domestic letter of credit (a condition precedent).

When NAMARCO officials (petitioners Almendras and Datoc) failed to comply with the writ, Judge Cloribel declared them in contempt of court and ordered their arrest. The Judge subsequently refused to give due course to their appeal from the contempt order. Petitioners filed this special civil action for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus to annul the Judge's orders.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N mandamus lies to enforce the performance of a contractual obligation.
2. W/N the issuance of the preliminary mandatory injunction was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that mandamus never lies to enforce the performance of contractual obligations [1], [2]. A contractual obligation is not a duty specifically enjoined upon a party by law resulting from office, trust, or station [1], [2]. The aggrieved party's proper remedy is an ordinary action for specific performance [1], [2]. This rule applies even in suits against municipal corporations to compel payment of a price agreed upon in a contract (*City of Manila v. Posadas*; *Quiogue v. Romualdez*) [2].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the issuance of the mandatory injunction constituted grave abuse of discretion [3], [4]. A mandatory injunction is a serious remedy justified only in clear cases where the plaintiff's right is free from doubt and dispute [5]. In this case, VILTRA's rights were not clear as NAMARCO disputed the perfection of the contract and VILTRA's compliance with conditions precedent [6]. Furthermore, the writ was improper because it amounted to a judgment and an order of execution before a hearing on the merits [3], [4].

The petition is **GRANTED**. The orders of the respondent Judge, including the writ of mandatory injunction and the contempt orders, are voided and set aside [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
