I. CAPTION
LEOPOLDO SY-QUIA, et al. v. MARY A. MARSMAN, et al., G.R. No. L-23426, March 1, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., Actg. C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs (Sy-quia, et al.) filed a *quo warranto* proceeding against defendants (Marsman, et al.), the incumbent board of Marsman Investments, Ltd. [1]. Plaintiffs alleged they were duly elected directors during a meeting on December 29, 1960, and subsequently demanded that defendants vacate the offices and turn over corporate records [2, 3].

In their Answer, defendants denied the election by reproducing the complaint's specific wording and stating they "deny" it [4]. Regarding the plaintiffs' organizational meeting and demand to vacate, defendants claimed they had "no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief," despite the allegation that the demand occurred within the premises where defendants were present [5]. Plaintiffs moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing the Answer constituted a general denial that admitted the material allegations [6]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal granted the motion, ruling that the Answer failed to tender an issue [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendants' Answer constituted a specific denial sufficient to tender an issue, thereby precluding judgment on the pleadings.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the Answer was effectively a general denial that admitted the material allegations of the complaint [8, 9].

The Court ruled that there is no distinction between a plea denying "each and every allegation" and one that reproduces the complaint's recitals to deny them; both constitute a **general denial** [10]. Under **Rule 8, Section 10** of the Revised Rules of Court, a defendant must specify each material allegation not admitted and, whenever practicable, set forth the matters relied upon to support the denial [8, 11]. Here, defendants failed to specify which parts of the election allegations they denied (e.g., the meeting itself, the election results, or the applicable law) [10].

Furthermore, while the Rules allow a denial based on "lack of knowledge or information," this must be availed of in sincerity and good faith (*Warner Barnes v. Reyes*) [12]. The Court found the defendants' claim of ignorance regarding events happening within their own premises to be clearly evasive and lacking in good faith [12]. An evasive answer that does not touch the heart of the controversy violates the policy of fair disclosure and warrants a judgment on the pleadings [13].
