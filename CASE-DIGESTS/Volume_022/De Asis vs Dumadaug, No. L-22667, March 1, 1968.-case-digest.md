**I. CAPTION**
*Jose, Justa, Fredeswinda, Basilio, Vivencio, all surnamed De Asis and Josefina Diancin v. Angelina, Rosita and Alejandrita all surnamed Dumadaug; Federico, Gregorio and Aurelio all surnamed De Asis; Fructuoso Torres, in her own behalf and as heir of Consuelo and Jose De Asis; Milagros, Manuel and Natividad all surnamed De Asis; and the First Division, Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. L-22667, March 1, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., Actg. C.J. [1-3]

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners filed a petition for review of a decision by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 24228-R, to which the Supreme Court gave due course on May 6, 1964 [3]. On June 15, 1964, the Clerk of Court required the petitioners' counsel via registered mail to file a printed brief within thirty (30) days [3]. However, counsel failed to claim the notice from the postmaster despite notification sent on July 1, 1964 [4]. The notice became effective five days later, on July 6, 1964, making the deadline for the brief August 5, 1964 [4]. No brief was filed, nor was any extension requested [4]. The respondents were subsequently required to file their brief but also failed to do so despite receiving the requirement on August 25, 1964 [4]. Since that date, neither party filed any pleadings or motions [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petition should be dismissed for lack of interest. [5]

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court held that the failure of the petitioners and the respondents to file their briefs despite notice evidenced a clear "lack of interest" [2, 5, 6]. Specifically, the petitioners failed to claim the notice to file a brief and subsequently failed to file said brief or ask for an extension within the reglementary period [4]. Consequently, the petition was ordered dismissed for lack of prosecution [5].
