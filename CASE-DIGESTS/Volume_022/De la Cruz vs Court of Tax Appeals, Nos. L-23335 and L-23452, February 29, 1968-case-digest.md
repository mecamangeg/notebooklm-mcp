I. CAPTION
ROSITA C. DE LA CRUZ, joined by her husband, JULIO T. DE LA CRUZ v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS and THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. Nos. L-23335 and L-23452, February 29, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
In 1954 and 1955, petitioners Rosita and Julio de la Cruz imported foodstuffs and textiles from Hong Kong and Japan [1]. While covered by shipping documents, the importations lacked the necessary consular invoices and Central Bank release certificates required by Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 [1]. The Collector of Customs instituted seizure proceedings, but allowed the release of the goods under bond after payment of duties and taxes [1]. Subsequently, the Collector found the importations violative of the Central Bank circulars and ordered the forfeiture of the bonds posted [1]. The Commissioner of Customs and the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the decision [1]. Petitioners appealed, arguing that "no-dollar" imports do not require release certificates, that the repeal of Circulars 44 and 45 by Circular 133 abated their liability, that Customs lacked jurisdiction over Central Bank violations, and that the government was estopped from forfeiture after releasing the goods [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Central Bank release certificates are required for "no-dollar" importations.
2. W/N the repeal of Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 by Circular No. 133 abated the petitioners' liability.
3. W/N the Commissioner of Customs has jurisdiction to order forfeiture for violations of Central Bank circulars.
4. W/N the Bureau of Customs is estopped from forfeiting the bonds after releasing the goods upon payment of duties.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Goods brought to the Philippines without dollar remittance during the effectivity of Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 were still required to have a Central Bank release certificate [4]. The Court held in *Capulong v. Acting Commissioner of Customs* that practically all imports, including no-dollar exchanges, represent an immediate or potential demand on foreign exchange [4]. The certificate is necessary for the Central Bank to monitor the volume of imports and formulate policy accordingly [4].

2. **NO.** The Court has consistently declared that liabilities incurred for violations of Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 have not been abated by the issuance of Central Bank Circular No. 133 [5].

3. **YES.** Under Section 1250 (now Section 1207) and Section 1363 (now Section 2530) of the Revised Administrative Code, the Bureau of Customs has the duty to enforce customs laws and "other laws relating to customs, commerce, navigation" [5, 6]. Goods imported without requisite release certificates are considered "merchandise of prohibited importation" or merchandise subject to importation only upon prescribed conditions [5, 7]. It is the duty of the Collector to exercise jurisdiction to prevent such importation or secure compliance with legal requirements, including the decree of forfeiture [7, 8].

4. **NO.** The release of the goods was secured under the express condition set forth in the bonds that the entire amount would be paid to the Bureau of Customs if it was finally decided that the merchandise should be forfeited [8]. By obtaining possession of the goods under these terms, petitioners recognized and submitted to the authority of the Bureau to decree forfeiture and are estopped from questioning it [9].

**Decision affirmed.** [10]
