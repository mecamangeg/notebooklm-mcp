I. CAPTION
BATANGAS TRANSPORTATION COMPANY v. GREGORIO CAGUIMBAL, PANCRACIO CAGUIMBAL, MARIA MARANAN DE CAGUIMBAL, BIÑAN TRANSPORTATION COMPANY and MARCIANO ILAGAN, G.R. No. L-22985, January 24, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On April 25, 1954, Pedro Caguimbal was a passenger on a Batangas Transportation Company (BTCO) bus driven by Tomas Perez traveling south in Tanauan, Batangas [1]. To allow a passenger to disembark, Perez slowed down and positioned the bus partly on the right shoulder and partly on the asphalted road [2, 3]. Approaching from the opposite direction was a *calesa* followed by a Biñan Transportation Company (Biñan) bus, driven by Marciano Ilagan at high speed [1, 3]. As the vehicles met, the Biñan bus attempted to overtake the *calesa* by passing through the space between the *calesa* and the stationary BTCO bus [2]. The Biñan bus hit the left side of the BTCO bus and wrecked the *calesa*, resulting in the death of Caguimbal and another passenger [2, 4].

Caguimbal's heirs sued BTCO, which filed a third-party complaint against Biñan and Ilagan [4]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint against BTCO [5]. The Court of Appeals reversed this ruling, finding BTCO, Biñan, and Ilagan jointly and severally liable [5]. BTCO appealed, arguing the accident was caused solely by the recklessness of the Biñan driver [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N BTCO is liable for damages for failure to exercise extraordinary diligence.
2. W/N the award of attorney's fees is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** BTCO is liable. Under Article 1733 of the Civil Code, common carriers must observe extraordinary diligence for the safety of their passengers [6]. While the Biñan driver was reckless, the BTCO driver also failed to exercise the required "utmost diligence" [3]. The driver saw the oncoming *calesa* and the speeding Biñan bus behind it; he should have anticipated the overtaking attempt and driven his bus *completely* onto the wide shoulder to provide sufficient clearance [3]. Instead, he left the bus partly on the asphalt, creating a hazardous situation and making his passengers' safety dependent on the diligence of the other driver [3]. Under Article 1756, a carrier is presumed negligent in case of passenger death or injury unless it proves it observed extraordinary diligence, which BTCO failed to do [7, 8].

2. **YES.** The award is proper under Article 1208 of the Civil Code, which permits attorney's fees when the court deems it "just and equitable" [9]. The Court justified the award noting that the plaintiffs were constrained to litigate for over 13 years and that it is necessary to impress upon public utility operators the magnitude of their responsibility regarding passenger safety [10].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed.
