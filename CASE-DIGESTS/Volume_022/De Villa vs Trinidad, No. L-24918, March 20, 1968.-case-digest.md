I. CAPTION
FELIX DE VILLA v. ANACLETO TRINIDAD, DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, and MARIANO S. TRINIDAD, G.R. No. L-24918, March 20, 1968, 22 SCRA 1167, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Cesario Fabricante owned a parcel of land covered by TCT No. 50, derived from OCT No. 183 registered on January 30, 1920 [1, 2]. In 1944, he mortgaged the land to Felix De Villa, surrendering the owner's duplicate certificate [3]. In 1945, Fabricante falsely claimed the duplicate was lost and obtained a new one, which he used to sell the land to Eustaquio Palma [3, 4]. Palma obtained TCT No. 12, which indicated derivation from OCT No. 34 registered on November 25, 1920 [2, 4]. Palma mortgaged the land to DBP, which foreclosed and subsequently sold it to Anacleto Trinidad [5, 6].

Meanwhile, De Villa reconstituted TCT No. 50, foreclosed the mortgage against Fabricante, and purchased the land at public auction, obtaining TCT No. 3347 [6, 7]. After De Villa took possession, Trinidad filed a forcible entry case and repossessed the land [8]. De Villa then filed a complaint for declaration of ownership and damages [8]. The lower court ruled in favor of De Villa, finding his title was derived from an earlier original certificate (Jan. 30, 1920) compared to the defendants' (Nov. 25, 1920) [9]. Trinidad and DBP appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N De Villa’s title prevails over that of Trinidad and DBP.
2. W/N De Villa is barred by laches.
3. W/N the award of damages against Trinidad was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** De Villa's title prevails. The Supreme Court applied the doctrine in *Legarda v. Saleeby* (31 Phil. 590), ruling that where two certificates of title are issued to different persons covering the same land, the earlier in date must prevail as between original parties, and in case of successive registrations, the person holding under the prior certificate is entitled to the land [10]. De Villa’s title is based on OCT No. 183 registered on January 30, 1920, while Trinidad’s title is based on OCT No. 34 registered on November 25, 1920 [10]. De Villa’s claim prevails as it is based on the earlier title, and unlike the defendants', his title was never tainted with fraud [10].

2. **NO.** De Villa is not barred by laches. He protected his rights by securing a Transfer Certificate of Title and, upon dispossession by Trinidad on March 2, 1961, filed the case for determination of ownership within a reasonable time on January 26, 1962 [11]. These facts show he did not sleep on his rights [11].

3. **YES, but with modification.** The Court ruled that damages should only be assessed from the filing of the complaint on January 26, 1962, as Trinidad’s prior possession was pursuant to a court order and deemed in good faith [12, 13]. Furthermore, the damages awarded to De Villa must be offset against the value of necessary and useful expenses and improvements incurred by Trinidad prior to the filing of the action [13].

The judgment is **AFFIRMED** with the modification that damages are recoverable only from the filing of the complaint, subject to offset against reimbursable improvements determined in supplementary proceedings [14].
