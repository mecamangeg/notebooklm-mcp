**I. CAPTION**
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. AGUSTIN PARIÑA, G.R. No. L-20990, February 29, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

**II. FACTS**
On November 28, 1950, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a judgment in favor of Philippine National Bank (PNB) against Agustin Pariña. The judgment became final but remained unsatisfied. On February 28, 1961—more than ten years after the judgment became final—PNB filed a complaint to revive the judgment [1, 2]. As Pariña's whereabouts were unknown, he was summoned by publication [3]. He failed to file an answer and was declared in default [3]. The trial court, upon the commissioner's recommendation, dismissed the complaint *motu proprio* on the ground of prescription [4]. PNB appealed, contending that the defense of prescription is deemed waived if not pleaded by the defendant [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the trial court may dismiss the complaint on the ground of prescription *motu proprio* when a defendant summoned by publication fails to answer.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that while the general rule is that prescription is waived if not pleaded, this does not apply when the defendant is summoned by publication and fails to answer [6]. Summons by publication is a constructive process, and it cannot be assumed that the defendant was actually aware of the complaint or that he intentionally waived the defense [6]. This is distinct from cases involving personal service, where a failure to answer may be considered a waiver [6].

Furthermore, the Court cited Article 24 of the New Civil Code, which mandates that courts protect a party who is at a disadvantage and cannot assert their rights [7]. Since PNB's own evidence demonstrated that the action to revive the judgment was filed beyond the ten-year prescriptive period, the trial court correctly took the initiative to dismiss the case [7].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [8].
