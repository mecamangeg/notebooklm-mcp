I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ELPIDIO BELCHEZ, G.R. No. L-21196, March 28, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of April 10, 1960, Gregorio Subion, his sister Norberta, Raymundo Samodio, and Gil Vargas were fishing along the seashore in Calolbon, Catanduanes. They were suddenly pelted with stones. When a stone hit Samodio, Gregorio flashed his petromax lamp toward the rocks and saw the accused, Elpidio Belchez, emerge. Belchez approached and struck Gregorio on the head with a stone, causing fatal injuries, including a fractured skull. Belchez raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was asleep at home, and argued that the prosecution witnesses were biased relatives with a grudge regarding poisoned livestock. The Court of First Instance convicted Belchez of Murder and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*. Belchez appealed, questioning his identification and the presence of qualifying circumstances.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused was positively identified despite his alibi and the witnesses' relationship to the deceased.
2. W/N the killing was attended by evident premeditation and treachery, qualifying it to Murder.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The prosecution clearly identified the appellant as the killer. Witnesses Norberta and Raymundo categorically recognized him by the light of the moon and the petromax lamp [1]. Additionally, a friend of the appellant, Apolonio Sumalde, testified that Belchez had forced him to go to the shore and confided his intention to kill "someone" [1]. The defense of alibi was rejected because the appellant's house was a short distance from the crime scene, making it physically possible for him to be present at the killing and return home immediately [2]. The Court further held that the relationship of witnesses to the victim is not sufficient to destroy their credibility [2].

2. **NO.** The Court found the crime to be Homicide, not Murder. Evident premeditation was not proven because the appellant's statement to Sumalde about killing "someone" was generic and did not refer specifically to the deceased [3]. Treachery was also negated because the appellant first threw stones at the group, effectively putting them on guard, and launched the attack using only a stone in the immediate presence of the victim's companions [3].

Accordingly, the judgment is **MODIFIED**. The appellant is found guilty of **Homicide** and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) day of *prision mayor*, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of *reclusion temporal*, as maximum [4].
