I. CAPTION
JUANA T. DE LA CRUZ v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS and THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. Nos. L-23334 and L-23451, February 29, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
In 1955, petitioner Juana T. de la Cruz imported several shipments of merchandise from Hong Kong to Manila. These shipments were supported by shipping documents but lacked Central Bank (CB) release certificates [1, 2]. The authorities seized the goods for violation of CB Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 in relation to Sections 1363(f) and 1250 of the Revised Administrative Code (RAC) [1, 2]. Petitioner claimed these were "no-dollar" importations and secured the release of the goods by filing surety bonds with Alto Surety and Insurance Co., Inc. [3, 4].

The Collector of Customs subsequently ordered the petitioner and her surety to pay the full amount of the bonds because the goods were imported in violation of the cited circulars and laws. The Commissioner of Customs and the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed this decision [4]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that no-dollar imports did not require release certificates, that the subsequent Circular No. 133 repealed the previous circulars and extinguished her liability, and that Customs authorities lacked jurisdiction to impose the penalty [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N no-dollar importations required a Central Bank release certificate under CB Circulars Nos. 44 and 45.
2. W/N the repeal of Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 by Circular No. 133 extinguished the petitioner's liability.
3. W/N the petitioner is estopped from questioning the government's right to forfeit the goods.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that no-dollar importations made while CB Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 were in force required a Central Bank release certificate [6]. Practically all imports, including those involving no-dollar exchange, represent either an immediate or potential demand for foreign exchange [6]. The Central Bank must know the precise volume of imports for policy formulation. Attempting to import goods without the certificate constituted a violation of Sections 1250 and 1363 of the Revised Administrative Code, subjecting the goods to forfeiture [6].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the liabilities incurred by the importer for violating the circulars were not abrogated or extinguished by the subsequent promulgation of Central Bank Circular No. 133 [6].

3. **YES.** The enforcement of Section 1363 of the RAC and seizure proceedings fall under the authority of the Commissioner of Customs, subject to review by the CTA [7]. Furthermore, the bonds filed by the petitioner expressly acknowledged the authority of the Government to demand payment of the full amount should forfeiture be decreed [7]. Having secured the release of the goods subject to this condition, the petitioner is in estoppel to question the government's right to decree the forfeiture [8].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED [8].
