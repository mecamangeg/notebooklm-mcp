I. CAPTION
GOV. PEDRO R. DIZON v. HON. TITO V. TIZON, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Bataan, THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF BATAAN, GUILLERMO ARCENAS, and MEDINA LACSON DE LEON, G.R. Nos. L-28550 to L-28552, March 27, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Dizon and respondents Arcenas and De Leon were candidates for Governor of Bataan in the November 1967 elections. Dizon filed three separate petitions for judicial recount (Cases 80, 83, and 84) in the Court of First Instance (CFI).

In Case 80, Dizon alleged a discrepancy in Precinct 5 (one vote difference) and Precinct 10. In Precinct 10, the official copies of the returns gave Arcenas 132 votes, while an "advance municipal treasurer's copy" gave him 122. The CFI dismissed Case 80 after trial, ruling the one-vote difference immaterial and the advance copy invalid for recount purposes.

In Cases 83 and 84, filed on December 27, 1967, and January 8, 1968, respectively, Dizon sought recounts for other precincts. However, the canvass for these precincts had already been terminated on December 5 and 6. The CFI dismissed these cases on motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and splitting a cause of action. Dizon filed a petition for certiorari, mandamus, and prohibition with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a judicial recount is justified by a one-vote discrepancy or a discrepancy appearing in an "advance" municipal treasurer's copy.
2. W/N the trial court has jurisdiction over recount petitions filed after the board of canvassers has terminated the canvass.
3. W/N the filing of separate petitions for judicial recount constitutes splitting a cause of action.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under **Section 163 of the Revised Election Code**, the difference in votes must be such as to affect the result of the election. The one-vote discrepancy in Precinct 5 was not material [1]. regarding Precinct 10, the "advance municipal treasurer's copy" is not one of the authentic copies prescribed by law (official copies for the municipal treasurer, provincial treasurer, and Commission on Elections) and cannot be the basis for a recount (*Acuña v. Golez*; *Palarca v. Arieta*) [2].

2. **NO.** **Section 163 of the Revised Election Code** requires that the discrepancy be brought to the attention of the board "in the process of the canvass." Since the canvass for the precincts in Cases 83 and 84 had long been terminated when the petitions were filed, the court had no jurisdiction to order a recount [3].

3. **YES.** A judicial recount under Section 163 constitutes only one cause of action, regardless of the number of precincts involved. The law envisions a summary proceeding to avoid delay. Public policy against splitting causes of action forbids a petitioner from seeking redress piecemeal or in installments [4].

Petition dismissed.
