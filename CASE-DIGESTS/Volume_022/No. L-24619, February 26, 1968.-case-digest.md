I. CAPTION
CALTEX (PHILIPPINES), INC. v. ACTING COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-24619, February 26, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Between 1960 and 1961, petitioner Caltex (Philippines), Inc. imported crude oil and other articles through the ports of Batangas and Davao [1], [2]. Pursuant to Department of Finance Order No. 22 and Republic Act No. 2609, the Bureau of Customs added a 25% margin fee to the peso value of these importations when converting them from dollars to pesos for the purpose of assessing customs duties and special import taxes [3].

Caltex paid the duties and taxes under protest, arguing that the 25% margin fee should not be included in the conversion rate, claiming it resulted in an overpayment of approximately P699,537.25 [2]. The Collectors of Customs in Batangas and Davao denied the protests, and the Commissioner of Customs affirmed these denials [2]. Caltex appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals, which dismissed the petition and sustained the inclusion of the margin fee [2], [4]. Caltex then appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the 25% margin fee should be included in the "current rate of exchange" used to determine the tax base for customs duties and special import taxes.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Tax Appeals.

Under Section 204 of the Tariff and Customs Code, imported values quoted in foreign currency must be converted to Philippine currency at the "current rate of exchange or value specified or published, from time to time, by the Central Bank of the Philippines" [5]. The Court held that this phrase does not necessarily refer to the par value of the peso under the Coinage Act, but rather the value fixed by the Central Bank [5].

A margin levy on foreign exchange is a form of exchange restriction designed to control the exchange rate and stabilize the currency without changing the par value [6]. By its very nature, the margin levy is part of the rate of exchange fixed by the government [6]. Furthermore, regarding the special import tax, the Court ruled that Section 3 of R.A. 1394 (Special Import Tax Law) and Section 201 of the Tariff and Customs Code are *in pari materia*; thus, the same conversion rate including the 25% margin fee applies [7].

Petition denied; judgment affirmed [8].
