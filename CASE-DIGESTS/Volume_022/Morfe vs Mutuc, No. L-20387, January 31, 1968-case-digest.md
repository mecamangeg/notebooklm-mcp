I. CAPTION
JESUS P. MORFE v. AMELITO R. MUTUC, as Executive Secretary, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20387, January 31, 1968, 22 SCRA 424, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Congress enacted Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) in 1960 to deter dishonesty and improve morality in public service. Section 7 of the Act requires every public officer to file a sworn statement of assets and liabilities (SALN) within 30 days of assuming office, and "within the month of January of every other year thereafter" [1].

Plaintiff Jesus P. Morfe, a Court of First Instance Judge, filed his initial SALN upon assuming office but challenged the requirement for the *periodical* submission of subsequent statements [2]. He filed an action for declaratory relief in the CFI of Pangasinan, arguing that the requirement was oppressive, an unconstitutional exercise of police power, and violated his rights to due process, privacy, and protection against unreasonable search and seizure and self-incrimination [3, 4].

The lower court ruled in favor of Morfe, declaring Section 7 unconstitutional insofar as it required the periodical submittal of the sworn statements [5]. The defendants (Executive Secretary and Secretary of Justice) appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Section 7 of R.A. 3019 requiring the periodical submission of SALNs is unconstitutional for being violative of due process and an oppressive exercise of police power.
2. W/N the requirement violates the constitutional right to privacy.
3. W/N the requirement violates the guarantees against unreasonable search and seizure and self-incrimination.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act was enacted under the police power of the state to promote morality in public service [7]. While public officials are entitled to the protection of due process and liberty, the police power extends to regulatory actions affecting them to promote the general welfare [8, 9]. The requirement to file a SALN is a reasonable regulation aimed at curtailing opportunities for official corruption and maintaining a standard of honesty [10]. It is not arbitrary or oppressive, and thus does not violate due process [11].

2. **NO.** While the Court recognized the right to privacy as an independent constitutional right, it held that the challenged provision does not infringe upon it [12, 13]. There is a rational relationship between the requirement to disclose assets and the valid objective of the statute (preventing graft), which precludes the objection that it is an unconstitutional intrusion into a private sphere [13, 14]. A public officer, by virtue of their position, is subject to such reasonable regulations [13].

3. **NO.** Regarding search and seizure, the constitutional guarantee does not grant freedom from testimonial compulsion [15]. The obligation to provide information (the SALN) is not an unreasonable search [16]. Regarding self-incrimination, the Court held that this protection applies to actual cases (criminal, civil, or administrative) where a person is compelled to be a witness against himself [17]. In a declaratory relief proceeding, there is no pressing need to pass upon the "sincerely voiced fear" of incrimination; mere compulsory disclosure of non-incriminatory facts does not violate the clause [18].

The decision of the lower court is **REVERSED** [19].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Concepcion, Reyes (J.B.L.), Makalintal, Bengzon (J.P.), Zaldivar, and Angeles concurred. Justice Castro concurred in the result. Justice Sanchez reserved his vote [20].
