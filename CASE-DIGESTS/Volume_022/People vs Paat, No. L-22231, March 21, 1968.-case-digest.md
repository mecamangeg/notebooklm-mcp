I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PAAT, G.R. No. L-22231, March 21, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On the morning of August 25, 1957, in Amulong, Cagayan, an altercation ensued between the group of the accused and the Catuiran brothers over a refusal to drink *basi*. When Teodorico Catuiran (victim) intervened, Juan Donato held his right hand while Virgilio Paat held his left, rendering him helpless. At this juncture, the accused Marcelo Paat approached from behind and stabbed Teodorico in the back [1, 2]. The trial court convicted Marcelo of murder but appreciated the mitigating circumstance of passion or obfuscation [3]. The Court of Appeals found the crime was qualified by treachery without any mitigating circumstance, punishable by *reclusion perpetua*, and certified the appeal to the Supreme Court [4]. Marcelo claimed he acted in defense of his brother, Virgilio [2, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused acted in defense of a relative.
2. W/N the mitigating circumstance of passion or obfuscation is applicable.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court rejected the defense of relative. The prosecution established that the accused stabbed the victim while the latter was held defenseless by the accused's companions [2]. It was only *after* the accused had mortally wounded the victim that the victim was released and able to retaliate against Virgilio [6]. Consequently, the defense theory had no basis as there was no unlawful aggression to repel at the time of the stabbing.

2. **NO.** The mitigating circumstance of passion or obfuscation was not present. While the victim attempted to intervene in the quarrel, he was immediately rendered helpless by the accused's companions [7]. Taking advantage of this helpless condition to stab the victim from behind constitutes treachery, and the facts proven did not support the existence of an impulse powerful enough to produce passion or obfuscation [7, 8].

The judgment is modified; the accused is sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* [8].
