**I. CAPTION**
JOSE C. AQUINO, ET AL. v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-28392, January 29, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

**II. FACTS**
In the November 14, 1967 elections, the incumbent City Mayor, Vice-Mayor, and all ten City Councilors of Butuan City were candidates for reelection, effectively disqualifying them from sitting as members of the City Board of Canvassers [1], [2]. The Board consisted of thirteen members, but only the City Fiscal remained qualified to sit [2]. To fill the twelve vacancies, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) issued a resolution on November 30, 1967, appointing substitute members [1]. While COMELEC appointed officials specifically listed in Section 159 of the Revised Election Code (e.g., City Engineer, Health Officer), there were insufficient officials listed in the statute to fill all vacancies. Consequently, COMELEC appointed seven other city officials not listed in Section 159 (e.g., Chief of Police, Fire Chief, Assistant City Treasurer) [3], [2].

Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that the seven substitutes not explicitly listed in Section 159 should have been appointed by the President under Section 28 of the Revised Election Code, rather than by COMELEC [4], [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N COMELEC has the authority to appoint substitute members of the Board of Canvassers other than those specifically mentioned in Section 159 of the Revised Election Code.
2. W/N Section 28 of the Revised Election Code regarding presidential appointments applies to vacancies in the Board of Canvassers.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that COMELEC has the power to appoint other officials to the Board. Under Article X, Section 2 of the Constitution, COMELEC is empowered to appoint "election inspectors and other election officials," and members of the Board of Canvassers are considered election officials distinct from their regular posts [6], [7]. While Section 159 names specific substitutes (e.g., Superintendent of Schools), this law was enacted when boards were smaller [8]. A "gap in the law" arose because the size of the boards increased (e.g., Butuan has 13 members) while the list of statutory substitutes remained limited to six [9]. The Court held that if the officials named in Section 159 are unavailable or insufficient to fill all vacancies, COMELEC may appoint other officials of the province or city to complete the board [10]. This ruling clarifies *Torres v. Ribo*, establishing that the limitation in *Torres* only applies if Section 159 officials are actually available [11], [12].

2. **NO.** The Court held that Section 28 of the Revised Election Code is obsolete [13]. Section 28 previously authorized the President or Governor to appoint substitutes for members of provincial boards or municipal councils disqualified from performing election duties (such as fixing precincts). However, since the enactment of Republic Act No. 599, these election duties were transferred to COMELEC, rendering Section 28 purposeless [14], [15]. Furthermore, Section 159 is a specific provision governing Boards of Canvassers, which prevails over the general provision of Section 28 [16].

**Petition dismissed.** [17]
