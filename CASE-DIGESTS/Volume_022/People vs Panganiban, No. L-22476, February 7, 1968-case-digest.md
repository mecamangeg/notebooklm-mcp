I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SENANDO PANGANIBAN, SAMSON PANGANIBAN, and ROBERTO FLORES, G.R. No. L-22476, February 7, 1968, 22 SCRA 817, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On November 25, 1959, in San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, Almaquio Martinez (victim) went to the house of the barrio lieutenant to settle a dispute regarding a carabao with the Panganiban family [1, 2]. Upon arrival, he was met by appellants Senando Panganiban, Samson Panganiban, Roberto Flores, and Eleuterio Panganiban [2]. Despite Martinez's statement that he came to settle the matter amicably, Eleuterio suddenly punched him, followed by Flores kicking him [3]. While Martinez was lying face up, Samson and Senando hacked him with bolos, and Flores clubbed him with a piece of wood [3]. Martinez sustained a total of nineteen (19) wounds, including fractures and contusions, which caused his death by acute hemorrhage [4].

The Court of First Instance of Occidental Mindoro convicted Senando and Samson as principals and Eleuterio and Flores as accomplices to the crime of murder, qualified by treachery [5]. The appellants appealed, alleging self-defense, claiming Martinez was the aggressor who attempted to draw a bolo [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appellants' plea of self-defense is tenable considering the number of wounds inflicted on the victim.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court rejected the plea of self-defense, ruling that the infliction of nineteen (19) wounds on the victim completely negates such a claim [7]. Citing long-standing jurisprudence from *United States v. Gonzales* (1907) to *People v. Constantino* (1967), the Court held that the nature, number, and location of the wounds are indicative of aggression rather than self-defense [7, 8]. The sheer number of injuries exposes the inherent weakness of the defense's theory [8]. Furthermore, the Court upheld the lower court's findings on the credibility of the prosecution witnesses—the barrio lieutenant's wife and daughter—who positively identified the appellants as the attackers [9, 10].

The judgment of conviction for murder is **AFFIRMED** [11].
