I. CAPTION
APOLONIO GALOFA v. NEE BON SING, G.R. No. L-22018, January 17, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Apolonio Galofa filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Sorsogon against defendant Nee Bon Sing for the recovery of possession and to quiet title over a parcel of land. Galofa alleged in Paragraph 4 of his complaint that he was unable to take actual possession due to an "unwarranted adverse claim of rights of ownership and possession by the defendant" based on an alleged sale by a certain Fe Nicolas.

In his Answer, Nee Bon Sing denied the "material averments contained in paragraph 4" but conjoined this denial with a statement that he "never asserted title of ownership... nor claimed any possessory right over the said property." Galofa moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the answer failed to tender an issue. The lower court granted the motion, declaring Galofa the owner and ordering Nee Bon Sing to deliver possession and pay attorney's fees. Nee Bon Sing appealed, arguing his answer tendered a genuine issue.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendant's specific denial constitutes a negative pregnant that effectively admits the material allegations of the complaint.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the defendant's denial is a negative pregnant, which is equivalent to an admission. A negative pregnant exists where a fact is alleged with some qualifying or modifying language, and the denial is conjunctive; in such cases, only the qualification or modification is denied, while the fact itself is admitted.

Here, the plaintiff alleged inability to possess due to the defendant's adverse claim, followed by details of how that claim was exercised. The defendant denied the "material averments" but simultaneously disclaimed dominical or possessory rights "in the manner alleged in the complaint." This ambiguous pleading failed to squarely deny the existence of a cloud on the title or the adverse claim itself, but merely the specific details of it. Since the defendant effectively admitted the material allegations and expressly disclaimed any right to the land, there was no issue to be tried.

The petition was denied, and the judgment of the lower court was affirmed.
