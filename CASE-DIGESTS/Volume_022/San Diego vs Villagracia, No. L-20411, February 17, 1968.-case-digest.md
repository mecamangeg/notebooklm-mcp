I. CAPTION
BARTOLOME E. SAN DIEGO v. SALVADOR R. VILLAGRACIA, ET AL., ATTYS. JESUS M. NACIONGAYO, AGUSTIN T. MISOLA and PROCOPIO SANTOS, G.R. No. L-20411, February 17, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Bartolome San Diego filed a petition for certiorari in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to annul a decision of Regional Office No. 5 of the Department of Labor, which ordered him to pay workmen's compensation. San Diego argued that Reorganization Plan 20-A, which granted jurisdiction to regional offices, was unconstitutional. On April 24, 1959, the CFI issued a writ of preliminary injunction against the Regional Office officials (Villagracia and Cabili) to stop the execution of the award.

However, the labor case had already been elevated to the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) in Manila for review. San Diego amended his petition to include the WCC as respondents, but the CFI only admitted this amendment on February 1, 1960. Meanwhile, on January 22, 1960, the WCC affirmed the award and its Secretary, respondent Procopio Santos, issued a writ of execution. Consequently, San Diego filed a motion for contempt against Santos and the claimant's lawyers, Attys. Misola and Naciongayo, for violating the injunction. The CFI found them guilty of indirect contempt and fined them P50.00 each. The respondents appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondents are liable for indirect contempt for disregarding the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the CFI.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's order. To constitute indirect contempt under Rule 71, two requisites must concur: (1) the writ must be lawful, and (2) the disobedience must be willful. Neither requisite was present in this case.

First, the writ was not lawful because the CFI lacked jurisdiction. The Court reiterated that Reorganization Plan 20-A is constitutional regarding the jurisdiction of labor regional offices. Original and exclusive jurisdiction over workmen's compensation claims belongs to these offices and the WCC, with appeals taken directly to the Supreme Court. Courts of First Instance have no jurisdiction to review or annul WCC decisions. An injunction issued by a court without jurisdiction is void *ab initio* and cannot be the basis for a contempt charge.

Second, the disobedience was not willful. The original injunction was directed only against the officials of Regional Office No. 5 in Iloilo. At the time the WCC issued the execution (January 22, 1960), the WCC was not yet a party to the case, as the amended petition including them was only admitted on February 1, 1960. A party not enjoined cannot be presumed to be aware of the court's order, and respondent Santos could not be punished for performing a duty enjoined by law absent a valid restraining order against him.

The order appealed from is reversed and set aside, and the respondents-appellants are absolved.
