**I. CAPTION**
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. CHOA EK YONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-21738, March 1, 1968, Sanchez, J. [1-3]

**II. FACTS**
In 1959, Choa Ek Yong filed a petition for naturalization, averring an average annual income of P3,600.00 to support himself, his wife, and their three children [4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila declared him eligible for Philippine citizenship on December 3, 1960 [3]. After the lapse of the two-year statutory period, the lower court allowed the petitioner to take the prescribed oath on April 18, 1963 [3]. The Republic appealed the order allowing the petitioner to take the oath [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner satisfies the lucrative income requirement for naturalization. [4]

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's order. The Court ruled that the petitioner's income is to be reckoned as of the time of the filing of the application [4]. Relying on *Ty Eng Hua vs. Republic*, the Court held that the petitioner's 1959 annual income of P3,600.00, intended to support a family of five (himself, his wife, and three children), fails to meet the lucrative income requirement, citing *Law Tai vs. Republic* [4]. Consequently, the petitioner is disqualified from Philippine citizenship [4].

The order was reversed, the application for naturalization was dismissed, and the petition to take the oath was denied [5].
