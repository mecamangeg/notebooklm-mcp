I. CAPTION
FLOREÑA TINAGAN v. JOSE PERLAS, JR., Warden, Provincial Jail of Iloilo, G.R. No. L-23965, January 30, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Floreña Tinagan, co-administratrix of the estate of Jaime Siason, was ordered by the Court of First Instance of Iloilo to deliver a house sold at public auction to the Iloilo Chinese Commercial High School [1]. When she failed to comply, the court ordered the Sheriff to eject her, but she still refused [1]. Consequently, the court ordered her arrest [1]. Upon being brought before the trial judge and asked if she was willing to comply with the order, Tinagan answered that "she did not want and she does not want to obey the order and would refuse to obey the order of the court" [1]. Interpreting this as a refusal to obey under Section 7, Rule 71 of the Rules of Court, the judge summarily ordered her confinement in the Provincial Jail until she signified willingness to obey [2]. Tinagan filed a petition for habeas corpus, arguing that her alleged misbehavior constituted indirect contempt requiring a written charge and hearing under Section 3, Rule 71, while the respondent Warden argued it was direct contempt committed in the court's presence under Section 1, Rule 71 [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's verbal refusal to obey the court order, made in the presence of the judge after her arrest, constitutes direct contempt which may be punished summarily.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the petitioner's conduct did not amount to direct contempt. The Court explained that her refusal to obey the order to deliver the house constitutes indirect contempt, which requires a written charge and an opportunity to be heard [4]. Her statement in court did not constitute misbehavior or disrespect because she would not have had the occasion to give such an answer had she not been arrested and brought before the judge [5]. Furthermore, she was merely giving a truthful and candid answer to the court's question regarding her willingness to comply, which she resisted due to a pending petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court [5, 6]. Citing *Austria v. Masaquel*, the Court held that a truthful answer given in response to a judge's question is not an act of contempt [6]. The power to punish for contempt should be used sparingly, with caution, and with due regard for constitutional rights [7].

The petition was **GRANTED**, and the bond posted by the petitioner was cancelled [8].
