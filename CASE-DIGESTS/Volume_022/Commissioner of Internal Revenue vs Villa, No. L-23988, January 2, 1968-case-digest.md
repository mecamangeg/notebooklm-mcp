I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. LEONARDO S. VILLA and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-23988, January 2, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Leonardo S. Villa and his wife filed joint income tax returns for the years 1951 to 1956. On February 23, 1961, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) issued assessments for deficiency income tax and residence tax against them using the net worth method. Villa received the assessments on April 7, 1961. Without previously contesting or protesting said assessments before the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), Villa filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) on May 4, 1961 [1]. The CTA took cognizance of the case, tried it on the merits, and rendered a decision largely reversing the assessments [2]. The CIR appealed to the Supreme Court. Although the parties submitted voluntarily to the CTA's jurisdiction and did not raise the issue of jurisdiction during the trial, the Supreme Court examined the issue *motu proprio* [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Tax Appeals has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a tax assessment that was not previously contested by the taxpayer before the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) lacked jurisdiction. Under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125, the CTA exercises exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review "decisions" of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments [4]. The Court interpreted the word "decisions" to mean the decision of the Commissioner on the *protest* of the taxpayer against the assessment, and not the assessment itself [5].

Because Villa appealed directly to the CTA upon receiving the assessment without filing a protest or contest with the Commissioner, the appeal was premature [6]. Consequently, there was no "decision" on a disputed assessment for the CTA to review. The Court emphasized that jurisdiction is conferred by law and not by consent of the parties; thus, it can be challenged at any stage of the proceedings, and courts may dismiss a case *ex mero motu* for lack of jurisdiction [3, 7].

The judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals was SET ASIDE for lack of jurisdiction, and the petition for review filed therein was ORDERED DISMISSED [8].
