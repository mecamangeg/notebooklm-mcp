I. CAPTION
RICARDO PARULAN v. DIRECTOR OF PRISONS, G.R. No. L-28519, February 17, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ricardo Parulan was serving a 20-year commuted prison term in the state penitentiary at Muntinlupa, Rizal [1]. In October 1964, he was transferred to Fort Bonifacio in Makati, Rizal, from where he escaped custody [1]. He was recaptured in the City of Manila [1]. Parulan was subsequently prosecuted and convicted for evasion of service of sentence (Article 157 of the Revised Penal Code) by the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [1]. Parulan filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that his confinement was illegal because the CFI of Manila lacked jurisdiction over the offense, as his original confinement and escape occurred in Rizal, not Manila [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance of Manila had jurisdiction to try and convict the petitioner for evasion of service of sentence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that evasion of service of sentence is a continuing or transitory offense [4]. Under Section 14, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Court, criminal actions may be instituted in the court of the municipality or province where the offense was committed or where any of its essential ingredients took place [5].

The Court explained that while some crimes are consummated in a single place, others are continuing by nature [4]. Similar to kidnapping and illegal detention, the crime of evasion of service of sentence is continuous because the prisoner's attempt to defeat the law persists as he moves from one place to another [4]. The crime is not fully consummated upon escape; rather, the escapee is deemed to be continuously committing the crime as long as he evades service [4]. This is supported by Rule 113, Section 6(c), which allows for the warrantless arrest of escapees because they are in the continuous act of committing a crime [4, 6]. Since Parulan was found and arrested in Manila while evading his sentence, the CFI of Manila had jurisdiction to try the case [1, 4].

The writ is denied [6].
