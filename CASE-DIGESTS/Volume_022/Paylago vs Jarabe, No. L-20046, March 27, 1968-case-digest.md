I. CAPTION
ROMEO PAYLAGO and ROSARIO DIMAANDAL v. INES PASTRANA JARABE and THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-20046, March 27, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
The subject land was originally titled under Anselmo Lacatan. In 1936, Anselmo sold a portion to Apolonio Lacatan (unregistered and deed lost), who in turn sold it to Hilario Jarabe (respondent's late husband) in 1938 via an unregistered deed. Respondent Ines Jarabe has been in continuous possession since.

Years later, after Anselmo's death, his heirs executed deeds of sale in 1953 favor of petitioners (Paylago spouses) covering the entire lot, including the portion occupied by respondent. Petitioners registered these sales and obtained TCT No. T-4208 in 1954. During a subsequent survey, petitioners sought to recover the portion held by respondent. The trial court and Court of Appeals ruled in favor of respondent, finding that petitioners were aware of respondent's possession and ownership claim prior to their purchase, evidenced by a lease deed where petitioners admitted respondent's possession since 1945.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioners have a preferred right of ownership as the first registrants under Article 1544 of the Civil Code.
2. W/N secondary evidence was properly admitted to prove the contents of the lost unregistered deed of sale.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that while petitioners are the registered owners, their title is tainted with bad faith. Under Article 1544 of the Civil Code, the preference given to the purchaser who first records the sale in the Registry of Property is premised on **good faith**. A purchaser who has knowledge of facts which should put him upon inquiry as to possible defects in the vendor's title, or who has knowledge of a prior transfer to another, is a purchaser in bad faith. Such knowledge vitiates the title acquired by the subsequent registration. Since the lower courts conclusively found that petitioners knew of respondent's possession and claim of ownership before they bought the land, they cannot invoke the protection of the Torrens system.

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed that the loss of the original unregistered document was sufficiently proved. To admit secondary evidence, it is not necessary to prove loss beyond all possibility of mistake; a reasonable probability of loss shown by a *bona fide* and diligent search is sufficient. Following proof of due execution and loss, the contents were properly proven by the recollection of witnesses (citing *Michael & Co. v. Enriquez* and *Government of P.I. v. Martinez*).

**Decision affirmed.**
