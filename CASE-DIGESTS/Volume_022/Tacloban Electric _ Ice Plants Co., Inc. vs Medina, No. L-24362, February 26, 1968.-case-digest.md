**I. CAPTION**
TACLOBAN ELECTRIC & ICE PLANTS CO., INC. v. COMMISSIONER ENRIQUE MEDINA and PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-24362, February 26, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Tacloban Electric & Ice Plants Co., Inc. held a certificate of public convenience. Following requests from the Tacloban Municipal Board and the Commissioner of Customs, the Public Service Commission (PSC) ordered the petitioner to reduce its electric rates by 10% in a decision dated May 3, 1963 [1, 2]. Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) claiming the rates were confiscatory [3].

On February 3, 1965, the PSC issued an order purporting to deny the MR. This order was signed by Commissioner Medina and two others, while three Associate Commissioners dissented, resulting in a 3-3 vote [3]. Petitioner contended that the tie vote did not constitute a valid denial and moved to break the tie, but Commissioner Medina refused to act, treating the tie as a denial [4]. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus with the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a 3-3 tie vote by the Public Service Commission constitutes a valid denial of a Motion for Reconsideration.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the order denying the MR was invalidly promulgated. Section 3, paragraph 3 of the Public Service Act, as amended by Republic Act 2677, expressly provides that "the concurrence of at least four commissioners shall be necessary for the promulgation of a final decision or order resolving such motion for reconsideration" [5].

The Court rejected the argument that a tie vote operates as a denial. Instead, a tie signifies an inability of the requisite number of Commissioners to render a decision. In such cases, the law mandates that the Commission refer the matter to the Secretary of Justice, who shall designate Judges of the Courts of First Instance or Attorneys of the PSC legal division to sit temporarily as Commissioners to resolve the impasse [6, 7].

Regarding the effectivity of the original rate reduction, the Court affirmed that under Section 33 of the Act, orders prescribing rates are immediately operative; the Commission has no discretion to suspend them [7, 8].

**Disposition:** The orders of February 3 and March 12, 1965 were ANNULLED, and the case was REMANDED to the Public Service Commission for further deliberation or reference to the Secretary of Justice, without prejudice to the immediate effectivity of the May 3, 1963 decision [8].
