I. CAPTION
HEIRS OF PEDRO REGANON, ET AL. v. RUFINO IMPERIAL, G.R. No. L-24434, January 17, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
The Heirs of Pedro Reganon (Petitioners) filed a complaint for recovery of ownership and possession of a parcel of land against Rufino Imperial (Respondent). The trial court declared Imperial in default and rendered judgment ordering him to vacate the land and pay P1,929.20. To satisfy the money judgment, the court issued an alias writ of execution against Imperial's share in the residuary estate of his deceased father, Eulogio Imperial, which was deposited with the Philippine National Bank (PNB).

Eulogio was under PNB's guardianship prior to his death on September 13, 1962. The funds in the estate consisted of accumulated monthly allowances from the United States Veterans Administration (USVA). The heirs of Eulogio, including Rufino, had already executed a Deed of Extrajudicial Partition. Rufino moved to quash the writ, arguing that: (1) the funds were in *custodia legis* (guardianship proceedings) and could not be attached; and (2) the funds were USVA pension proceeds and thus exempt from execution. The trial court denied the motion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the interest of an heir in property under guardianship/administration (*custodia legis*) is subject to attachment.
2. W/N the accumulated USVA pension funds remain exempt from execution after the veteran's death.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Section 7, Rule 57 of the new Rules of Court, property in *custodia legis* is now attachable, provided a copy of the order of attachment is filed with the proper court and notice is served upon the custodian. This supersedes the old ruling in *Asia Banking Corp. v. Elser*. Furthermore, the guardianship formally ceased upon the death of the ward, Eulogio. Under Article 777 of the New Civil Code, rights to succession are transmitted from the moment of death. Since the heirs had already executed a Deed of Extrajudicial Partition, the property is no longer property of the estate but of the individual heirs and is legally attachable (*De Borja v. De Borja*).

2. **NO.** The exemption of a pension, annuity, or gratuity is a right *personalissima* (purely personal) founded on the necessity of tiding the recipient over during old age or disability. When the recipient dies, the necessity motivating the grant ceases. Therefore, the exemption does not extend to the heirs after the veteran's death.

The orders appealed from are AFFIRMED.
