I. CAPTION
FLOREÑA TINAGAN v. HON. VALERIO V. ROVIRA, TAN CHUY HO, ROSARIO GERALDE, ADELINA JUAN S. LOA and ESTER H. JAMORA, G.R. No. L-23555, January 29, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Floreña Tinagan and the deceased Jaime Siason lived together as husband and wife without the benefit of marriage and had four children. Upon Siason’s death, Tinagan and Atty. Julio Albis were appointed co-administrators of his estate, which consisted mainly of a two-story building. Creditors of the estate filed a petition to sell the building to satisfy debts. Tinagan opposed, claiming ownership of one-half of the building and challenging the validity of the claims. Respondent Judge Valerio Rovira issued an Order on July 22, 1964, directing the sale of the building. Tinagan filed a notice of appeal and record on appeal. However, Judge Rovira disapproved the record on appeal on the ground that the co-administrator, Atty. Albis, was not consulted. Meanwhile, the building was sold at public auction. Tinagan filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition to set aside the sale order, and mandamus to compel the approval of her appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N certiorari and prohibition are the proper remedies to assail the lower court's order to sell the estate's property.
2. W/N the disapproval of the record on appeal was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** To assail the order of a probate court to sell the property of a ward or decedent, **appeal**—not certiorari or mandamus—is the proper remedy. The Supreme Court ruled that orders in administration cases relating to the sale of the decedent's property are appealable, as they are in the nature of a judgment upon the issues involved (citing *Santos v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Nueva Caceres*). Furthermore, the writs of certiorari and prohibition were denied because the issue had become *functus officio*, as the sale of the property had already been consummated and title vested in the buyer.

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court found that the disapproval of the record on appeal was not based on legal grounds. There was no showing that the record was defective, filed out of time, or non-compliant with the Rules of Court; it was disapproved merely because the co-administrator did not conform to it. Consequently, the trial court was directed to set the record on appeal for hearing.

**Writs of certiorari and prohibition denied; writ of mandamus granted.**
