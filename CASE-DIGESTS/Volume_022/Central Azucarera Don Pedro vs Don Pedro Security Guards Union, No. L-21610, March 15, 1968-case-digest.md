I. CAPTION
CENTRAL AZUCARERA DON PEDRO v. DON PEDRO SECURITY GUARDS UNION, et al.; DON PEDRO SECURITY GUARDS UNION v. CENTRAL AZUCARERA DON PEDRO, et al., G.R. Nos. L-21610, L-21619 & L-25767, March 15, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
In 1956, Central Azucarera Don Pedro (Central) terminated the services of several security guards who were members of the Don Pedro Security Guards Union (Union) after they filed money claims and organized the union [1, 2]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found Central guilty of unfair labor practice and ordered the reinstatement of 24 guards with back wages [3, 4]. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court: Central challenged the finding of unfair labor practice (L-21610), while the Union challenged the exclusion of two guards from reinstatement and the deferment of the execution of the judgment pending appeal (L-21619 and L-25767) [4-6]. Pending resolution, the parties filed motions to withdraw the petitions, stating they had reached an amicable settlement where the guards, now employed elsewhere, waived reinstatement to preserve industrial peace [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitions should be dismissed due to the amicable settlement.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the amicable settlement reached by the parties rendered the three consolidated cases moot and academic [9, 10]. The agreement, wherein the Union members manifested their intention not to return to their former positions, was accepted as a valid resolution to avoid further dissension and conflict between the claimant and non-claimant groups [8]. Consequently, the Court dismissed the petitions for certiorari without pronouncement as to costs [10].
