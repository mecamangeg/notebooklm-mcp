I. CAPTION
JULIA SAN BUENAVENTURA v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and CRISANTA SAN BUENAVENTURA, G.R. No. L-23980, January 31, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Julia San Buenaventura and respondent Crisanta San Buenaventura are sisters who inherited a 2,159-square-meter parcel of land in Taytay, Rizal, from their grandfather in 1937 [1]. Julia has possessed the land continuously since 1944, building a house thereon in 1947 and exercising acts of dominion such as surveying the land in her name, applying for a free patent, and mortgaging the property [2-4]. On November 20, 1957, Crisanta executed an affidavit (Annex A) ceding the land to Julia, declaring Julia the sole owner, and requesting the transfer of the tax declaration to Julia’s name [5, 6].

On May 28, 1962, Crisanta filed a complaint for partition, alleging co-ownership [1]. The Court of First Instance (CFI) dismissed the complaint, ruling in favor of Julia [7]. However, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the CFI, declaring the property as common ownership and ordering partition [7]. The CA reasoned that the 1957 affidavit was not a valid donation or sale, lacked consideration, and was merely intended to facilitate tax payments [8]. Julia appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the 1957 affidavit executed by Crisanta constituted a valid recognition of Julia's exclusive ownership over the property.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the affidavit was principally intended to be a recognition, acknowledgment, or admission of Julia's exclusive title to the land, rather than a void donation or sale [9]. This conclusion is supported by the evidence that Julia had held the land as exclusive owner since 1944, performing acts of dominion such as building a house, surveying the land, and opposing third-party registration claims, while Crisanta made no demands for possession or benefits until 1962 [9, 10].

Furthermore, the Court ruled that the Court of Appeals had no justification for declaring the cession devoid of cause or consideration. The existence of cause or consideration in a cession is presumed unless there is evidence to the contrary [11]. Julia acquired title by prescription and by the cession made by Crisanta [11].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED**, and that of the Court of First Instance is **AFFIRMED**.
