I. CAPTION
CENTRAL TAXICAB CORPORATION v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION and CHAMBER OF TAXICAB SERVICES, INC., G.R. No. L-24289, February 17, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Central Taxicab Corporation, an existing operator of 88 taxicab units, filed an application on October 10, 1960, for an increase of 200 units (Case No. 62-6225) [1, 2]. On September 7, 1964, the Public Service Commission (PSC) rendered a decision covering 99 separate applications, denying Petitioner's application without stating the specific reasons for the denial [1-3]. The PSC generally reasoned that old operators who sold units were disqualified from receiving new ones [4]. Petitioner appealed, arguing the denial was arbitrary because: (1) it was one of the earliest applicants and not merely filing a "counter-application"; (2) it had proven its financial capacity and competence; and (3) while it sold 5 units in 1950, it subsequently acquired 45 units, negating any claim of speculating in certificates [2, 3, 5]. The PSC granted 10 additional units to P & B Taxicab Co., which had similar circumstances of selling and buying units, but denied Petitioner’s request [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the Petitioner's application for additional taxicab units.

IV. RULING
**YES.** While the factual findings of the Public Service Commission are generally binding on the appellate court, they may be modified or ignored when not supported by substantial evidence or when the Commission commits grave abuse of discretion [7, 8]. The Court found the denial of Petitioner's application to be without legal basis and contrary to the evidence [3].

The PSC decision failed to specify why Petitioner's application was denied, whereas Petitioner presented unrefuted evidence of its financial capability, experience, and preparation to operate [3]. The sale of 5 units in 1950 was sufficiently explained by the subsequent acquisition of 45 units, disproving speculation [3]. Furthermore, the Commission acted arbitrarily by granting 10 additional units to P & B Taxicab Co., which was in similar circumstances, while denying Petitioner [6]. To avoid discrimination, Petitioner is entitled to an allocation proportionate to its operating fleet.

The decision is **REVERSED**, and the Public Service Commission is directed to authorize Petitioner to operate fifteen (15) additional units [6].
