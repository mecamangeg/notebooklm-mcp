I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. VICENTE C. UMALI and STATE BONDING & INSURANCE CO., INC., G.R. No. L-23066, March 1, 1968, 22 SCRA 922, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
The Republic, through the Solicitor General, filed a suit against Vicente Umali (promoter) and State Bonding & Insurance Co., Inc. (surety) to recover P12,078.02 representing the unpaid purses of boxers in a contest held on February 1, 1961 [1]. The suit was based on a surety bond of P32,500 posted by the defendants in favor of the Games and Amusements Board (GAB) [1]. The bond stipulated that if the promoter held the contest on the scheduled date, the obligation would be "null and void"; otherwise, it would remain in effect to insure reimbursement to ticket purchasers [2, 3]. The bond also referenced Article 3, paragraphs (b) and (d) of the GAB Rules and Regulations, which require bonds to cover contestants' purses and a percentage of gross receipts [2, 3]. The boxing contest took place as scheduled on February 1, 1961 [4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that the defendants could not be held liable [1, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the surety is liable for the boxers' purses under the bond executed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. The Court held that the terms of the bond were clear and plain: the obligation was conditioned on the holding of the contest. Since the contest actually took place on the scheduled date, the bond was discharged and became null and void by its very recitals [4].

Although the bond referenced GAB Rules and Regulations requiring coverage for purses, the specific terms of the contract limited the liability to ensuring reimbursement to ticket purchasers in case of the promoter's default [5]. While a bond executed pursuant to a statute or regulation normally incorporates said statute, such regulation "will not be construed to enlarge the surety's liability beyond the terms of his contract" [6]. Citing *Santos v. Mejia* (94 Phil. 211), the Court emphasized that a surety is not responsible beyond the terms of its undertaking [6]. Furthermore, even though the surety was compensated and not entitled to *strictissimi juris* construction, the bond's provisions were too clear to admit interpretation or extension by implication (*Visayan Surety & Insurance Corp. v. Central Bank*) [7].
