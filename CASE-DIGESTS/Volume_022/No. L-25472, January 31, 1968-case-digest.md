I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. ANGELA PURUGANAN and CONSOLACION R. WARNICK, G.R. No. L-25472, January 31, 1968, 22 SCRA 172, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On September 26, 1950, defendants Angela Puruganan and Consolacion R. Warnick obtained a P1,000 loan from the Philippine National Bank (PNB) secured by a real estate mortgage [1]. Due to non-payment, PNB foreclosed on the mortgage, and the property was sold at public auction on August 15, 1955, with PNB as the highest bidder [2].

On January 15, 1963, PNB filed a complaint for the revival and enforcement of the 1953 judgment, alleging that the mortgaged property was actually part of the Bimornay River and, being public domain, was outside the commerce of man [2]. PNB argued the judgment was therefore never satisfied [2]. Defendants contended that Puruganan owned the land at the time of the mortgage and foreclosure, and if it was subsequently washed away, it was due to a fortuitous event (Act of God) for which they were not liable [3].

After a pre-trial conference, the Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, ruling that the washing away of the land was an Act of God and that any action for breach of warranty had prescribed [4]. PNB appealed, arguing the dismissal deprived it of the right to adduce evidence [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the complaint for revival of judgment was proper without a trial on the merits.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal was improper because it prevented PNB from proving its material allegations.

The Court reasoned that if the land mortgaged was indeed part of a river as PNB alleged, it would be property of the public domain and **outside the commerce of man**. Consequently, under **Article 1409(4) of the New Civil Code**, the mortgage and the subsequent sale at public auction would be void ab initio [5]. If the sale was void, the judgment could not have been validly satisfied. Conversely, if the defendants’ claim that the land existed as private property at the time of the foreclosure is true, then the judgment was satisfied [5].

Since the resolution of the case depends on the truth of these opposing factual allegations, a **trial on the merits** is necessary [5].

The appealed order of dismissal is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [6].
