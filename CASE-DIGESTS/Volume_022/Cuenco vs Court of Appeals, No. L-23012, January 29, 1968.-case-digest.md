I. CAPTION
MIGUEL CUENCO v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and BISAYA LAND TRANSPORTATION CO., INC., G.R. No. L-23012, January 29, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On April 1, 1959, the Republic of the Philippines filed a petition for *quo warranto* in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against Bisaya Land Transportation Co., Inc. (Bisaya) and its directors, including petitioner Miguel Cuenco [1]. Miguel Cuenco filed an answer supporting the petition and set up a cross-claim against the other directors to recover P4,336,701.19 for the benefit of the corporation [2].

On December 3, 1963, the CFI granted Miguel Cuenco's petition for the appointment of a receiver [3]. Bisaya filed a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction in the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 33266-R) to annul the receivership order [3]. The CA issued a writ of preliminary injunction [3]. Miguel Cuenco moved to dismiss the CA case, arguing the CA lacked jurisdiction because his cross-claim exceeded P4,000,000.00, placing the case outside the CA's appellate jurisdiction [4]. The CA denied the motion and subsequently rendered a decision asserting jurisdiction and annulling the CFI's receivership order [4, 5]. Miguel Cuenco filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to issue the writ of certiorari and preliminary injunction given that the amount claimed in the cross-claim exceeded its appellate jurisdictional limit.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeals acted without jurisdiction.

Under the law then in force (Republic Act No. 296), the Court of Appeals' original jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari is limited to those "in aid of its appellate jurisdiction" [6]. Excluding specific cases (constitutional/criminal), appellate jurisdiction is determined by the "value in controversy" [6]. If the value exceeds P200,000.00, exclusive jurisdiction belongs to the Supreme Court [6].

The Court ruled that the "value of the controversy" is determined not only by the complaint or petition but also by other pleadings that determine the issues, such as the answer, counterclaim, or **cross-claim** [7]. Citing *Miailhe v. Halili*, the Court emphasized that an appeal often requires a review of the entire controversy. Since Miguel Cuenco’s cross-claim amounted to over P4 million, the case fell within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court [7, 8]. The jurisdiction based on value is not dependent on the validity or propriety of the claim; the CA cannot assume jurisdiction even to declare the cross-claim improper [7, 8]. Consequently, the proceedings in the CA were null and void *ab initio* [9].

The petition is granted; the writ of preliminary injunction and decision of the Court of Appeals are annulled, and the Supreme Court's injunction is made permanent [9].
