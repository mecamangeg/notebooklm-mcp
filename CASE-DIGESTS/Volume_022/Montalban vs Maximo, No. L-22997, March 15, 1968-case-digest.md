I. CAPTION
PABLO C. MONTALBAN, ET AL. v. GERARDO MAXIMO, G.R. No. L-22997, March 15, 1968, 22 SCRA 89, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs filed a suit for damages in the CFI of Manila against defendant Fr. Gerardo Maximo regarding a motor vehicle accident that injured plaintiff’s son. On August 15, 1958, summons was served at defendant’s residence at the parish church in Concepcion, Malabon, Rizal, through Fr. Arsenio Bautista. At the time of service, the defendant was temporarily absent from the Philippines, having left for Europe on August 7, 1958, and returning in October 1958 [1, 2].

The defendant was declared in default, and a judgment was rendered against him on June 8, 1959 ordering him to pay damages [3]. Plaintiffs notified defendant of the judgment in December 1959, but defendant took no action until February 20, 1962—over two years later—when he filed a motion to annul the proceedings [4, 5]. Defendant argued that the court did not acquire jurisdiction over his person because substituted service under Section 8, Rule 14 (now Rule 14, Sec. 7) was invalid given his absence from the country; he contended that extraterritorial service under Section 17 and 18 was the exclusive requirement [5, 6]. The lower court denied the motion [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N summons in a suit *in personam* against a resident of the Philippines temporarily absent therefrom may be validly effected by substituted service under Section 8, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's orders, ruling that substituted service against a resident temporarily absent is valid and effective.

The Court held that the term "defendant" in Section 8, Rule 14 includes any resident of the Philippines, regardless of whether they are physically present in the country at the moment of service [8]. Domiciliaries of a state, though temporarily out of its territorial jurisdiction, are always amenable to suits *in personam* therein [9]. The relationship of domicile creates responsibilities, including amenability to suit, provided the state employs a reasonable method for apprising the absent party of the proceedings [10].

The Court rejected the argument that extraterritorial service (Sections 17 and 18) is the sole method for serving temporarily absent residents. Section 18 uses the word "may," indicating it is merely an alternative mode; the normal method of service for a resident is substituted service at their dwelling [11]. A person temporarily absent leaves a definite place of residence and is expected to leave affairs in the hands of a person of suitable age and discretion [12]. Therefore, substituted service is adequate to meet the requirements of due process as it is reasonably calculated to give notice [13]. The fact that the defendant did not receive actual notice does not affect the validity of the service [14].

Furthermore, the Court ruled that the defendant was guilty of laches. He admitted learning of the judgment in December 1959 but "supinely sat" on the decision for over two years before challenging the court's jurisdiction [15, 16].
