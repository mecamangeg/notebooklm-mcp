I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE MARINE OFFICERS' GUILD v. COMPAÑIA MARITIMA, PHILIPPINE STEAMSHIP NAVIGATION CO., MADRIGAL SHIPPING CO., et al., G.R. Nos. L-20662 and L-20663, March 19, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Philippine Marine Officers' Guild (PMOG) demanded collective bargaining with respondents Compañia Maritima (Maritima), Philippine Steamship Navigation Co. (Philsteam), and Madrigal Shipping Co. (Madrigal) in June 1954. While disputes were pending, Maritima signed a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the Marine Officers Association of the Philippines (MOAP) on August 16, 1954. PMOG declared a strike against all three companies on August 24, 1954.

The President certified the dispute to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) pursuant to Section 10 of Republic Act No. 875. The CIR issued a return-to-work order, but its enforcement was stalled by a Supreme Court injunction in a related case. The CIR consolidated the certification case with several unfair labor practice (ULP) cases filed by PMOG. The CIR ruled that the strikes against Philsteam and Madrigal were justified, but the strike against Maritima was illegal from inception due to lack of cause and the use of violence (coercion, physical injuries, firing of shots) by strikers. The CIR en banc denied backwages for all strikers and denied reinstatement for Maritima strikers. PMOG appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR erred in failing to fix the terms of employment after presidential certification.
2. W/N the strikers are entitled to backwages.
3. W/N Maritima committed unfair labor practices (ULP).
4. W/N the strike against Maritima was illegal due to violence.
5. W/N the Maritima strikers are entitled to reinstatement despite the illegality of the strike.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 10 of R.A. 875, when a dispute is certified by the President, the CIR has the authority to find a solution. The CIR's decision to order a certification election to resolve the representation issue instead of immediately fixing employment terms was a valid solution conformable to the certification and cannot be questioned.

2. **NO.** Strikers are entitled to backwages only if they unconditionally offer to return to work and the employer discriminatorily refuses reinstatement. The CIR found that the companies were not to blame for the failure to rehire strikers immediately because the return-to-work order was enjoined by the Supreme Court.

3. **NO.** Maritima did not refuse to bargain; it had validly concluded a CBA with MOAP. Regarding the alleged interference via the killing of a striker by a company security guard, the Court held that the guard acted personally and not under company policy, as evidenced by his acquittal on appeal which found no conspiracy. Non-reinstatement was due to the injunction, not discrimination.

4. **YES.** The strike against Maritima was illegal. The Court rejected the view that labor violence should be overlooked. Acts of violence (e.g., physical injuries, breaking truck windows, firing shots) committed during a strike cannot be ignored as they encourage terrorism and subvert the law's purpose for peaceful settlement. PMOG is responsible because the acts were committed in the presence and with the cooperation of its leaders.

5. **NO.** An employer cannot be compelled to reinstate employees who participate in an unjustified and illegal strike. The strike against Maritima was declared for no valid purpose (as Maritima had not committed ULP) and was conducted with violence. Consequently, the dismissal of the strikers was proper.

The decision of the Court of Industrial Relations is **AFFIRMED**.
