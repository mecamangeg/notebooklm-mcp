I. CAPTION
JAO KING YOG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-24950, February 10, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jao King Yog, a Chinese citizen born in 1923, arrived in the Philippines in 1936 and resided continuously in Cebu, except for brief visits abroad. He is married, but his wife resides in Hong Kong, and they are childless. Employed at a department store, his average monthly income from 1961 to 1964 was P325.00, excluding bonuses. He filed a petition for naturalization, presenting Jose B. Delfin and Vicente Panique as character witnesses. The Court of First Instance of Cebu granted the petition. The Republic appealed, arguing that the character witnesses were insufficient and that the petitioner lacked a lucrative income.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the character witnesses satisfied the requirements of Commonwealth Act No. 473.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or lawful occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 requires an applicant to be of good moral character and to have conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during the *entire* period of his residence in the Philippines [1]. Witness Jose Delfin only met the petitioner in 1951 (despite the petitioner's residence starting in 1936) and knew him so poorly that he mistakenly believed the petitioner had a child [1]. Witness Vicente Panique's acquaintance was superficial, based solely on business dealings [1]. Thus, they could not vouch for the petitioner's conduct during his entire residence.

2. **NO.** The petitioner’s average monthly income of P325.00 is insufficient to meet the bare necessities of life, considering the high cost of living and the low purchasing value of the peso [2]. This amount is inadequate to support a wife and potential children whom he intends to bring to the Philippines. Furthermore, bonuses are not considered part of lucrative income, citing *Ho Ngo v. Republic* [2].

Accordingly, the judgment is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the petition is DENIED [3].
