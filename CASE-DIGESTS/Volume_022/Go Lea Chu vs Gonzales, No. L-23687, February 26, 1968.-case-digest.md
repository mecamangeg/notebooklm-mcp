I. CAPTION
GO LEA CHU, HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL, Judge, Court of First Instance of Manila, and THE CITY SHERIFF OF MANILA v. CORAZON GONZALES and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-23687, February 26, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Corazon Gonzales was a lessee of a stall in the Manila Shopping Center, which she verbally subleased to petitioner Go Lea Chu. When the stall was demolished, Gonzales assigned her leasehold rights to R & R Realty Co. for P11,000. Go Lea Chu was also paid to vacate [1, 2]. Gonzales filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 111371) regarding the sharing of these proceeds.

On the scheduled hearing date of February 28, 1964, Gonzales' counsel arrived ten minutes late because he had attended to matters in other court branches [3-5]. Due to this tardiness, Judge Cloribel dismissed Gonzales' complaint and allowed Go Lea Chu to prove her counterclaim ex-parte. Judgment was rendered the same day, ordering Gonzales to pay Go Lea Chu half the proceeds plus damages [3, 6, 7].

Gonzales filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) on the day of dismissal, which was denied. After receiving the judgment, she filed a "Second Motion for Reconsideration" on March 9, 1964, which was denied on May 11, 1964 [3, 6]. On June 2, 1964, she filed a Notice of Appeal [8]. However, on June 5, 1964, the trial court issued a writ of execution, believing the judgment was final. P3,500 was garnished from R & R Realty and paid to Go Lea Chu [8, 9]. The Court of Appeals (CA) granted Gonzales' petition for certiorari, setting aside the dismissal and ordering the return of the P3,500 [10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial judge committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the case due to counsel's ten-minute tardiness.
2. W/N the writ of execution was validly issued on the ground that the judgment had become final.
3. W/N the Court of Appeals could order the return of the P3,500 even if such relief was not prayed for in the pleadings.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The dismissal was a capricious and whimsical exercise of judicial power amounting to grave abuse of discretion. While tardiness is discouraged, a delay of ten minutes occasioned by excusable negligence (attending to other courts) is not a contemptuous disregard of duty warranting the "immediate and absolute purging" of a client's complaint [4, 5, 11]. The Court cited *Gil v. Talaña*, holding that it is an abuse of discretion to dismiss a case definitely where counsel is only a few minutes late [5]. The trial judge should have been more "human and tolerant" and allowed the plaintiff to participate in the trial [12].

2. **NO.** The writ of execution was void because the judgment had not yet become final. The "Second Motion for Reconsideration" filed on March 9 was effectively the *first* motion directed against the judgment itself (as opposed to the dismissal order), and thus was not *pro forma* [9, 13]. This motion suspended the period to appeal. Calculating the days elapsed between notices and filings, only 25 days had passed, meaning the appeal period had not expired [14]. Furthermore, the trial judge contradicted himself by granting an extension to file the record on appeal after issuing the execution [15].

3. **YES.** The Court of Appeals has the power to correct the error and order the restitution of the money to prevent the administration of justice from being "impotent and ineffectual" [16, 17]. Under Section 6, Rule 135 of the Rules of Court, courts have inherent power to employ all auxiliary means to carry their jurisdiction into effect [17]. Additionally, a judgment may grant relief to which a party is entitled, even if not specifically demanded in the pleadings, as held in *Schenker v. Gemperle* [18].

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
