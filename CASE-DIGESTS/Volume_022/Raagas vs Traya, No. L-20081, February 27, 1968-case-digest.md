**I. CAPTION**
MELQUIADES RAAGAS and ADELA LAUDIANO RAAGAS v. OCTAVIO TRAYA, MRS. OCTAVIO TRAYA and BIENVENIDO CANCILLER, G.R. No. L-20081, February 27, 1968, Castro, J.

**II. FACTS**
On April 1, 1960, spouses Melquiades and Adela Raagas filed a complaint against spouses Octavio Traya and their driver, Bienvenido Canciller, for the death of their three-year-old son, Regino. The plaintiffs alleged that on April 9, 1958, Canciller drove the defendants' truck recklessly, running over the child and causing his instantaneous death [1].

In their answer, the defendants specifically denied the allegation of reckless driving. They asserted that the truck was moving slowly and that the child suddenly rushed from an unseen position, attributing the accident to an "unforeseen event" or the fault of the child and his parents. Defendants also alleged they exercised due diligence in the selection and supervision of their driver [2].

The plaintiffs moved for a judgment on the pleadings, arguing the answer failed to tender an issue. The Court of First Instance of Leyte granted the motion, reasoning that the defendants' failure to address the allegation regarding the lack of a 1958 registration plate amounted to an admission of negligence under Article 2185 of the Civil Code. The lower court ordered the defendants to pay damages without a trial [3, 4]. The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved purely questions of law [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N judgment on the pleadings was proper.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the lower court erred in rendering judgment on the pleadings. Under Section 1, Rule 19 of the Rules of Court, judgment on the pleadings is proper only "where an answer fails to tender an issue, or otherwise admits the material allegations of the adverse party's pleading" [5].

In this case, the defendants' answer expressly denied the charge of reckless driving and averred that the death was caused by an unforeseen event or the negligence of the victim and his parents. Such averments effectively tendered a valid issue that requires a trial on the merits (*Philippine National Bank v. Lacson*; *Benavides v. Alabastro*) [6].

Furthermore, the Court emphasized that allegations regarding the amount of damages are not deemed admitted even if not specifically denied (*Abubakar Tan v. Tan Ho*). Actual damages must be substantiated by proof and cannot rely on speculation (*Tomassi v. Villa-Abrille*). Similarly, the factual basis for moral damages and its causal relation to the defendant's acts must be satisfactorily proved (*Malonzo v. Galang*) [6, 7].

The judgment on the pleadings was set aside, and the case was remanded to the court of origin for trial on the merits [8].
