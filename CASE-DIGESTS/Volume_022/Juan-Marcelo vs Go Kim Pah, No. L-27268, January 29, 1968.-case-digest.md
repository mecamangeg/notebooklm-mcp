**I. CAPTION**
JUANITA JUAN-MARCELO, et al. v. GO KIM PAH, et al., G.R. No. L-27268, January 29, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiffs-appellees Juanita Juan-Marcelo, et al. filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila (Civil Case No. 54871) against defendants-appellants Go Kim Pah, et al. for the annulment of a deed of sale, cancellation of title, and legal redemption of a property [1]. The CFI rendered a decision on August 8, 1966, annulling the sale, cancelling the title issued to defendant Equitable Development Company, and ordering the defendants to pay damages and back rentals [2, 3].

Dissatisfied, the defendants appealed the decision to the Supreme Court [4]. While the appeal was pending, the parties entered into a Compromise Agreement dated December 29, 1967 [5]. Under the agreement, the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiffs P42,000.00. In exchange, the parties agreed that the CFI decision be vacated and set aside, and that Equitable Development Company be declared the absolute owner of the disputed property, with plaintiffs waiving all claims [4, 6, 7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the compromise agreement setting aside the decision of the lower court should be approved.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court approved the compromise agreement. The Court held that a compromise agreement between party litigants, which sets aside a decision of the lower court affecting them, may be approved by the Supreme Court provided said agreement is not contrary to law, public order, public policy, morals, or good customs [8, 9]. Finding the submitted agreement valid under these standards, the Court rendered judgment in conformity with its terms and set aside the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila dated August 8, 1966 [9].
