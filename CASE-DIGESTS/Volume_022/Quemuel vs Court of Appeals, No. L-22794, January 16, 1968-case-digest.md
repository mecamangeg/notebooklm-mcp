I. CAPTION
RUFO QUEMUEL v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22794, January 16, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Rufo Quemuel was convicted by the Court of First Instance of Rizal for the crime of libel consisting of imputing bribery to a public officer [1]. He was sentenced to imprisonment and appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA) [1]. The CA affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty by imposing a fine of P500.00 instead of imprisonment, and adding an indemnity of P2,000.00 to the offended party, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency [1]. Quemuel filed a petition for review, arguing that the CA erred in awarding indemnity since the offended party did not appeal, that there was no proof of damages, and that subsidiary imprisonment for the indemnity violates the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellate court can award or increase indemnity even if the offended party did not appeal.
2. W/N proof of actual damages is required to award indemnity in libel cases.
3. W/N subsidiary imprisonment for non-payment of civil liability violates the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** An appeal in a criminal case opens the whole case for review, which includes the penalty and indemnity [3, 4]. Under Article 100 of the Revised Penal Code, the indemnity which a person is sentenced to pay forms an integral part of the penalty [5, 6]. While the authority to assess damages lies with the trial court in the first instance, this authority passes to the appellate court on appeal [3]. Thus, the appellate court may increase the damages or penalty even if the offended party did not appeal and only the accused sought a review of the decision [7].

2. **NO.** By its very nature, libel causes dishonor, disrepute, and discredit [5, 8]. Injury to the reputation of the offended party is a natural and probable consequence of defamatory words. When an article is libelous *per se*, the law implies damages, and the complainant is not required to introduce evidence of actual damages, particularly when the award is nominal [8, 9].

3. **NO.** Civil liability arising from libel is not a "debt" within the meaning of the constitutional provision against imprisonment for non-payment of debt [10]. In this constitutional context, "debt" refers to obligations to pay money arising from contracts, express or implied, and not those arising from torts or crimes [11]. Consequently, subsidiary imprisonment for non-payment of such liability is constitutional [10].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [12].
