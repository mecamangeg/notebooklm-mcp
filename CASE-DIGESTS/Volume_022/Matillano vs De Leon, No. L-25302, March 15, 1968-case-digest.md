I. CAPTION
ABUNDIO MATILLANO, ET AL. v. THE HON. SEVERIANO DE LEON AND ANGEL LOCSIN, G.R. No. L-25302, March 15, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, twenty-three farmworkers of respondent Angel Locsin, filed a complaint on April 4, 1963, before the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). They alleged violations of the Agricultural Tenancy Act (R.A. No. 1199) regarding unfair labor practices and the Minimum Wage Law (R.A. No. 602), seeking reinstatement and differential pay after being refused work following a strike [1, 2]. Respondent Locsin moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing the CAR lacked jurisdiction because no preliminary investigation was conducted prior to filing, a requirement under Section 5(d) of the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. No. 875) for unfair labor practice cases [3]. The CAR Judge dismissed the complaint, ruling that while R.A. 1199 did not explicitly require it, Section 55 allowed the application of R.A. 875, making the preliminary investigation a jurisdictional necessity [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a preliminary investigation is required before the Court of Agrarian Relations can take cognizance of a complaint for unfair labor practice filed by agricultural laborers.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the procedure applicable to agricultural laborers at the time the complaint was filed (April 1963) was governed by the Rules of the Court of Agrarian Relations, not the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. No. 875) [4]. The Court clarified that R.A. No. 875 was not applicable to agricultural laborers during that period, and the CAR's own rules did not require a preliminary investigation [5, 6]. Furthermore, the Court noted that a violation of the Minimum Wage Law is not an unfair labor practice that would trigger the procedural requirements of R.A. No. 875, and the CAR has jurisdiction over all disputes involving capital and labor relations on agricultural lands [7].

The Order of dismissal is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the case is remanded to the Court of Agrarian Relations for further proceedings [8].
