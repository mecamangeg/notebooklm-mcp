I. CAPTION
NORBERTO DE LA REA v. ABELARDO SUBIDO, in his capacity as Civil Service Commissioner, and JOSE D. CALDERON, General Manager, National Marketing Corporation (and consolidated cases), G.R. Nos. L-26082, L-27246 & L-27248, March 1, 1968, 22 SCRA 953, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Norberto de la Rea, then Auditor of Pasay City, faced administrative charges for gross misconduct filed by the Civil Service Commission (CSC) [1]. While the case was pending, the Auditor General appointed him as Auditor of the National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO) with a salary of P15,600, and later as Corporate Auditor with a salary of P26,400 [2, 3]. CSC Commissioner Abelardo Subido disapproved these appointments for violating Civil Service Rules and because of the pending charges [3]. Subsequently, Subido rendered a decision in the administrative case finding De la Rea guilty and suspending him for six months [1].

Instead of appealing to the Civil Service Board of Appeals, De la Rea filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila (Civil Case No. 63551), claiming the Commissioner lacked jurisdiction [4]. The CFI ruled in De la Rea's favor, declaring him the legal NAMARCO Corporate Auditor and the Commissioner’s decision void [5]. In a related case (Civil Case No. 67663), the CFI also issued a writ of execution pending appeal, ordering the payment of De la Rea’s back salaries and differentials [6]. The Auditor General and CSC Commissioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N De la Rea could resort to prohibition without exhausting administrative remedies regarding the disciplinary case.
2. W/N the appointments made by the Auditor General are subject to the approval and attestation of the Civil Service Commissioner.
3. W/N the Commissioner’s "attestation" is merely a ministerial duty to record the appointment.
4. W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing a writ of execution pending appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Prohibition is not a substitute for administrative remedies available in the ordinary course of law. De la Rea failed to appeal the Commissioner's decision to the Civil Service Board of Appeals as provided by the Civil Service Law (R.A. 2260) [7, 8]. Since the Commissioner has final authority on matters of discipline for officers in the competitive service, and the decision was not void *ab initio*, it became executory upon De la Rea's failure to appeal [9, 10].

2. **YES.** While the Constitution intends the Auditor General to be independent, his power of appointment is not absolute and must be exercised "in accordance with the Civil Service Law" pursuant to Section 1 of R.A. 2716 [11, 12]. Appointments to the General Auditing Office and government-owned corporations like NAMARCO do not become final or complete until approved by the Civil Service Commissioner [8, 13]. Since the NAMARCO charter does not exempt its officers from Civil Service Law, the Commissioner has exclusive jurisdiction to approve such appointments [14, 15].

3. **NO.** The authority to attest is not merely to take note that an appointment was made by a competent officer. It implies the authority to determine whether the appointment was made in accordance with law [16]. Since the Commissioner disapproved the appointments, they ceased to exist in law, and De la Rea is deemed to have reverted to his position as Auditor of Pasay City [17].

4. **YES.** Execution pending appeal is an exception to the general rule and requires a special reason [18]. The trial court abused its discretion because the appointment itself was in controversy and De la Rea's status as a government official was being questioned; thus, there was no justification for premature execution [19].

**Disposition:** The decisions of the CFI are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The decisions of the Civil Service Commissioner are declared VALID. De la Rea is ordered to return the salary differences received as NAMARCO Auditor. The preliminary injunction is made permanent [19-21].
