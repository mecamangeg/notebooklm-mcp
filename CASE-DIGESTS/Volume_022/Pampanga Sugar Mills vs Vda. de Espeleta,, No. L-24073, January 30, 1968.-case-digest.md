**I. CAPTION**
**PAMPANGA SUGAR MILLS v. REGINA GALANG VDA. DE ESPELETA, PEDRO P. PELAEZ, and BENITO MACROHON, G.R. No. L-24073, January 30, 1968, Fernando, J.**

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Pampanga Sugar Mills filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus to enjoin the execution of a Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) award granting death benefits to respondent Regina Galang Vda. de Espeleta [1, 2]. The WCC Referee had awarded compensation for the death of respondent's husband, ruling that while the claim was filed 2.5 years after death (beyond the 2-month period), the petitioner had extended financial assistance which was deemed an advance payment [2, 3]. Crucially, the Referee found that petitioner failed to report the death or controvert the claim within the statutory period (14 days after death or 10 days from knowledge) [4]. Petitioner sought to review this decision but failed to file its petition for review on time, alleging "excusable negligence" of its messenger [2]. Petitioner argued it had valid defenses, specifically prescription and that the cause of death (cerebral infarction due to hypertension) was not work-related [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner may still challenge the validity of the compensation claim despite its failure to controvert the claim on time.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the failure of an employer to explain its lack of controversion for an unreasonable length of time constitutes a renunciation of its right to challenge the claim under the Workmen's Compensation Act [5, 6]. Citing *Manila Railroad Co. v. WCC*, the Court reiterated that having failed to file its controversion on time, the petitioner waived or renounced by operation of law its right to question the validity or reasonableness of the respondent's claim for compensation [6, 7].

Such failure to controvert is fatal even to the defense that the employee's claim was filed out of the reglementary period [5]. Since the award must be sustained due to the lack of controversion, the Court found it unnecessary to resolve whether the petitioner's failure to file its petition for review on time was due to excusable negligence [5].

The petition for certiorari and mandamus is **DENIED**, and the writ of preliminary injunction is lifted [8].
