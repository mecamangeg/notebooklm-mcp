I. CAPTION
EMILIANA CRUZ v. ERNESTO OPPEN, INC., HON. CRISANTO ARAGON, and THE SHERIFF OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-23861, February 17, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On March 28, 1963, the City Court of Manila rendered a default judgment in an ejectment suit filed by respondent Ernesto Oppen, Inc. against petitioner Emiliana Cruz [1]. On May 22, 1963, petitioner filed a motion in the City Court to set aside the default order, claiming lack of jurisdiction because the summons was served on her salesgirl, who failed to deliver it to her [2, 3]. The City Court denied this motion and a subsequent motion for reconsideration [2].

On August 1, 1963, petitioner filed a petition for relief from judgment with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [4]. The CFI dismissed the petition on July 3, 1964, ruling it was time-barred because 71 days had elapsed since petitioner learned of the judgment on May 22, 1963, exceeding the 60-day limit prescribed by Rule 38 [3, 5]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the time consumed by the proceedings in the City Court should be deducted from the 60-day period [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for relief was filed within the mandatory 60-day period.
2. W/N the proceedings in the City Court suspended the running of the 60-day period.
3. W/N the negligence of the salesgirl constitutes excusable negligence under Rule 38.
4. W/N the CFI erred in dismissing the petition without an oral hearing.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petition was filed late. Section 3, Rule 38 of the Revised Rules of Court requires a petition for relief to be filed within 60 days after the petitioner learns of the judgment. Petitioner admitted learning of the judgment on May 22, 1963, but filed the petition only on August 1, 1963, which is a lapse of 71 days [3].

2. **NO.** The 60-day period set forth in Rule 38 is absolutely fixed, inextendible, and never interrupted [7]. It cannot be subjected to any condition or contingency. Furthermore, the motion to set aside the default order was filed in the City Court, which had no jurisdiction to grant relief from judgment; thus, it amounted to nothing and could not toll the running of the period [8].

3. **NO.** There was no showing of fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence. The salesgirl was of age and received the summons; her failure to deliver them to petitioner because she went to the province does not constitute excusable negligence [9]. Additionally, the affidavit of merit failed to show that a different conclusion would be reached if a new trial were granted [10].

4. **NO.** While the order dismissing the petition was issued without oral arguments, petitioner was not denied her day in court. The lack of original notice was cured by the fact that she was heard on her motion for reconsideration [11]. Judgment on the pleadings was proper as the answer admitted material allegations [12].

The orders appealed from are **AFFIRMED** [13].
