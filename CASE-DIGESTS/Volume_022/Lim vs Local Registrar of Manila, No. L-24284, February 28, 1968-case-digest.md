I. CAPTION
JAIME LIM, Minor, represented by his mother, TARCIANA RODRIGUEZ v. LOCAL REGISTRAR OF MANILA and LIM SUI KIAN, G.R. No. L-24284, February 28, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On September 2, 1963, petitioner Jaime Lim, a minor represented by his mother Tarciana Rodriguez, filed a petition to correct entries in the Local Civil Registrar of Manila [1]. The civil registry records listed him as "Jaime Lim" with the status of "Legitimate" and nationality as "Filipino" [1]. Petitioner alleged that his parents, Lim Sui Kian (Chinese) and Tarciana Rodriguez (Filipino), were never married [1]. He sought to change his surname to "Rodriguez" and his status to "Illegitimate" [2]. The manifest purpose of the petition was to establish that he is the illegitimate child of a Filipina—rather than the legitimate son of a Chinese father—to bolster his claim to Filipino nationality [2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the petition "without prejudice" [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the correction of entries regarding civil status and citizenship can be granted through a summary proceeding under Article 412 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that Article 412 of the Civil Code contemplates a summary proceeding involving only the correction of clerical errors of a harmless and innocuous nature [2]. It does not authorize changes involving civil status, nationality, or citizenship, which are substantial and/or controversial [2]. The Court found the petition's purpose—to shift the petitioner's legal status from legitimate to illegitimate to claim Filipino citizenship—to be substantial and controversial, thus falling outside the scope of Article 412 [2]. The Court relied on established jurisprudence, including *Ty Kong Tin v. Republic* and *Ansaldo v. Republic* [2].

Consequently, the dismissal order was **AFFIRMED**, with the modification that the "without prejudice" qualification was removed [3]. Treble costs were imposed on the petitioner and his counsel for filing an appeal manifestly devoid of merit [3].
