I. CAPTION
CONSOLIDATED TEXTILE MILLS, INC. v. REPARATIONS COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-23859, February 22, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
In 1961, Consolidated Textile Mills, Inc. (Consolidated) applied for an allocation of reparations goods (textile equipment) valued at $3,900,000.00 from the Reparations Commission (Commission) [1]. On November 29, 1961, the parties executed a "Contract to Purchase" [2]. Pursuant to existing regulations at the time, Consolidated paid a down payment and posted a guarantee bond calculated at the official exchange rate of P2.00 to $1.00 [2-4]. The contract stipulated that a "Contract of Conditional Purchase and Sale" would later be executed to supersede the "Contract to Purchase" [2].

In 1963, before the goods were delivered, a Presidential Directive was issued requiring the application of the free market rate (approximately P4.00 to $1.00) to all items in the Seventh Year Schedule, including Consolidated's allocation [5, 6]. The Commission demanded Consolidated pay the difference based on the higher free market rate [5]. Consolidated filed a suit for declaratory relief, arguing that the imposition of the new rate impaired its obligation under the "Contract to Purchase" which was perfected when the rate was P2.00 to $1.00 [7, 8]. The Court of First Instance denied the petition and upheld the free market rate [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Reparations Commission may apply the free market rate of exchange prevailing at the time of procurement instead of the P2.00 to $1.00 rate prevailing when the "Contract to Purchase" was executed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that the adoption of the free market rate did not impair any obligation [9].

The Court held that the "Contract to Purchase" was merely a preliminary agreement or an "agreement to make an agreement" [10]. It did not contain all essential terms, specifically failing to stipulate the rate of exchange to be used [11]. The contract expressly provided that it would be superseded by a "Contract of Conditional Purchase and Sale," indicating that the minds of the parties had not yet met on all terms, including the final peso cost [11, 12].

Although the down payment and bond were calculated at the P2.00 to $1.00 rate, this was merely in compliance with regulations existing at that time and did not imply a perpetual agreement to use that rate [4]. Since the Commission is obligated to pay the Japanese suppliers in U.S. dollars ($3,900,000.00), Consolidated must pay the equivalent peso cost based on the rate at the time of procurement (free market rate) to prevent unjust enrichment at the Commission's expense [13, 14].

The decision of the trial court was affirmed [9].
