I. CAPTION
A. D. SANTOS, INC. v. VENTURA VASQUEZ, G.R. No. L-23586, March 20, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Ventura Vasquez was employed as a taxi driver by petitioner A. D. Santos, Inc. [1]. On December 22 or 23, 1961, while driving the petitioner's taxicab, Vasquez vomited blood and suffered back pains, fever, and headache [1]. He reported the incident to the petitioner, was treated by the company physician, and was subsequently hospitalized and diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis [1]. Vasquez filed a claim for compensation with the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) on May 9, 1962 [1]. The WCC ruled in favor of Vasquez, ordering the petitioner to pay compensation and other costs [1-3]. The petitioner appealed, arguing that the claim should be dismissed because it was not filed within the two-month statutory period required by Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act [3, 4]. Petitioner also argued that Vasquez had no cause of action against it because Vasquez testified he worked for "City Cab" operated by Amador Santos, rather than the petitioner corporation [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claim is barred due to the failure to file within the statutory period prescribed by the Workmen's Compensation Act.
2. W/N the petitioner is the proper party liable for the claim despite the respondent identifying "City Cab" as his employer.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner's failure to file a notice of controversion with the Commission was fatal to its defense [4]. Since the employer knew of the employee's illness but failed to file the notice required by Section 45 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, it waived the defense that the claim was not filed within the statutory period [4]. Such failure forfeits the employer's right to controvert the claim and constitutes a constructive admission that the claim is compensable [4, 6, 7].

2. **YES.** The Court held that the claim was properly directed against the petitioner because it categorically admitted that Vasquez was its taxi driver [5]. Although Vasquez mentioned "City Cab" (formerly owned by Amador Santos, who became an officer of the petitioner) in his testimony, the Court applied the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil [8]. The Court reasoned that the corporate fiction cannot be used as a shield to confuse legitimate issues, such as the existence of an employer-employee relationship [1, 8].

The decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission is affirmed [9].
