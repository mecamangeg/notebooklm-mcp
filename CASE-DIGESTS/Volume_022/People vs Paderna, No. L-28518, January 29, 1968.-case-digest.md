I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LORENZO PADERNA y GAMBOA, G.R. No. L-28518, January 29, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On July 25, 1966, Lorenzo Paderna was found in possession of four packages of untaxed "blue seal" cigarettes in La Carlota City [1]. An information was filed against him on August 8, 1966, in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental for violation of Republic Act No. 4097 [2, 3]. The CFI convicted Paderna and sentenced him to a fine and imprisonment [1]. Paderna appealed to the Court of Appeals and filed a motion to quash (treated by the Supreme Court as a motion to dismiss), arguing that the CFI lacked jurisdiction [4, 5]. He contended that Republic Act No. 4713, which took effect on June 18, 1966 (prior to the offense and the filing of the information), amended the tax code and reduced the penalty for his offense, placing it within the jurisdiction of the City Court rather than the CFI [3, 4]. The Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court to resolve the jurisdictional issue [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction to try the case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the jurisdiction of a court is determined by the statute in force at the time of the commencement of the action [6-8]. In this case, the information was filed on August 8, 1966, after Republic Act No. 4713 had already taken effect on June 18, 1966 [3]. Under the amendatory law (R.A. 4713), the penalty for possession of untaxed imported articles with a value not exceeding P500 is a fine of not less than P50 nor more than P200 and imprisonment of not less than 5 days nor more than 30 days [3, 9]. Because the imposable penalty falls below the jurisdiction of the CFI, the case falls within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the City Court of La Carlota [3, 10]. Furthermore, the newly created Circuit Criminal Courts could not exercise jurisdiction because their jurisdiction is merely concurrent with the CFI in cases where the CFI has original and exclusive jurisdiction [11].

The motion was granted, and the case was dismissed without prejudice to the filing of another information in the City Court of La Carlota City [12].
