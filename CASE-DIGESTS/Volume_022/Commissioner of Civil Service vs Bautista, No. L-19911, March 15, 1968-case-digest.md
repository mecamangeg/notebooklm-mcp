I. CAPTION
THE COMMISSIONER OF CIVIL SERVICE v. THE HON. JOSE S. BAUTISTA, Presiding Judge, Court of Industrial Relations and THE KAPISANAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA SA MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-19911, March 15, 1968, 22 SCRA 1067, Dizon, J. [1-3]

II. FACTS
In 1948, the Manila Railroad Company (Company) and the respondent Union entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) governing appointments and promotions [4]. Following the enactment of the Civil Service Law (R.A. 2260) in 1959, the Company required employees to take qualifying examinations, converting those who failed from permanent to provisional status [5]. To resolve the ensuing labor dispute and prevent a strike, the parties agreed to submit the issue to respondent Judge Bautista as sole Arbitrator [5, 6]. The agreement, declaring the award final and unappealable, was signed by the Company, the Union, and the then Commissioner of Civil Service, who noted his concurrence "subject to the Constitution" [7]. The Arbitrator ruled that Union members were exempt from the 1959 Civil Service Law based on the 1948 CBA [8]. The petitioner Commissioner filed for certiorari, arguing the Court of Industrial Relations lacked jurisdiction and the award improperly dictated his official duties [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Commissioner of Civil Service is bound by the arbitration award exempting Union members from the Civil Service Law. [9, 10]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the parties, including the Commissioner of Civil Service at the time, validly withdrew the controversy from the court's jurisdiction by agreeing in writing to submit it to a sole Arbitrator [10]. The Petitioner's concurrence "subject to the Constitution" merely reserved the right to challenge the constitutional validity of the referral, yet the Court found nothing unlawful in submitting a legal question regarding Civil Service coverage to arbitration to preserve industrial peace [11, 12]. The agreement to accept the award as final imparted to it the character of a compromise agreement binding upon the parties [12]. Consequently, the Petitioner is estopped from assailing the award concurred in by his predecessor [13].

The petition is denied [14].
