**I. CAPTION**
**ESPERANZA FABIAN, BENITA FABIAN and DAMASO PAPA y FABIAN vs. SILBINA FABIAN, FELICIANO LANDRITO, TEODORA FABIAN and FRANCISCO DEL MONTE**, G.R. No. L-20449, January 29, 1968, Castro, J.

**II. FACTS**
Pablo Fabian purchased Lot 164 of the Friar Lands Estate in Muntinlupa in 1909. He died on August 2, 1928, survived by four daughters: Esperanza, Benita I, Benita II, and Silbina. However, on October 5, 1928, Silbina and Teodora Fabian (a niece) executed an affidavit falsely claiming to be the only heirs of Pablo. Based on this affidavit, the sale certificate was assigned to them, and the Director of Lands sold the lot to them. They took physical possession in 1929, declared it for taxation, and appropriated the fruits. In 1937, a Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) was issued in their names. In 1945, they subdivided the lot, resulting in the issuance of two separate TCTs. On July 18, 1960, the plaintiffs (Pablo’s other heirs) filed an action for reconveyance, alleging fraud. The lower court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the defendants had acquired title by acquisitive prescription.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the action for reconveyance based on a constructive trust is barred by prescription and laches.
2. W/N the defendants acquired valid title over the property through acquisitive prescription.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** An action for reconveyance based on a constructive or implied trust resulting from fraud may be barred by the statute of limitations. While express trusts are not subject to prescription, constructive trusts are. Citing *Gerona v. De Guzman*, the Court held that such action may be filed within four years from the discovery of the fraud. Discovery is deemed to have taken place when the new certificates of title were issued, which constitutes constructive notice to the world. Here, the TCTs were issued in 1937 and 1945, while the action was filed only in 1960. Furthermore, under *Diaz v. Gorricho*, laches bars the action because the plaintiffs failed to assert their rights for 32 years while the defendants openly possessed the property.

2. **YES.** Under Section 41 of Act 190, ten years of actual adverse possession by any person claiming to be the owner vests full and complete title. The defendants exercised adverse possession from 1929 by cultivating the land, paying taxes, and obtaining titles in their names to the exclusion of others. This open, public, and continuous possession under a claim of ownership for over 30 years vested absolute title in them by acquisitive prescription.

The judgment of the lower court dismissing the complaint is **AFFIRMED**.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Makalintal, *J.*, concurs in the result.
