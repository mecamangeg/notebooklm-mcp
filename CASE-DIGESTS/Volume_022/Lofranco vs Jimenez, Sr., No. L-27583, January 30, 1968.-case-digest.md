I. CAPTION
MARGARITO J. LOFRANCO v. JESUS JIMENEZ, SR., G.R. No. L-27583, January 30, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lofranco and Respondent Jimenez were candidates for Mayor of Inabanga, Bohol in the November 1963 general elections. Jimenez filed an election protest against Lofranco, the incumbent Mayor. Both the Court of First Instance of Bohol and the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Jimenez. Lofranco appealed to the Supreme Court via certiorari. On August 17, 1967, Lofranco filed a manifestation informing the Court that Jimenez had died. Lofranco argued that while the petition survives, the lower court decisions were *functus officio* as the right to hold office is personal. Jimenez’s counsel opposed, arguing the case was not moot regarding the right to recover costs and damages.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed for being moot.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the election protest had become moot. The record showed that the respondent-protestant was already dead and the term of the contested office (Mayor of Inabanga, Bohol) had already expired. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed without costs.
