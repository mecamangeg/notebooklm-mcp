I. CAPTION
MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY vs. COURT OF APPEALS and MARCELO LAPEÑA, doing business under the name and style "LA-PEÑA ENTERPRISES", G.R. No. L-21890, March 29, 1968, 22 SCRA 1364, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On December 5, 1959, a shipment of baby soothers and essential oil was discharged from the SS "Juno" into the custody of petitioner Manila Port Service (MPS) in good order. Four or five days later, the broker of respondent Marcelo Lapeña examined the goods and found them in good condition. However, on December 27, 1959, the broker discovered that the cases were damaged. A provisional claim was filed with MPS on January 4, 1960, followed by a formal claim on February 29, 1960. Upon actual delivery on February 3, 1960, a shortage valued at P1,370.00 was confirmed [1].

MPS rejected the claim because it was filed beyond the 15-day period from the date of discharge of the last package, as required by Section 15 of the Management Contract between MPS and the Bureau of Customs [2]. Lapeña filed suit in the Municipal Court of Manila, which ruled in his favor. The Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision. MPS appealed, arguing the claim was barred by prescription and that its liability should be limited to P500 per package [3-5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent's action is barred by his failure to file a provisional claim within 15 days from the discharge of the goods.
2. W/N the petitioners' liability is limited to P500.00 per package under the Management Contract.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that a literal application of the 15-day requirement in Section 15 of the Management Contract would be illogical and oppressive where the consignee had no reason to file a claim within that period [6, 7]. Although the claim was filed on January 4, 1960 (30 days after discharge), evidence showed the goods were in good condition days after discharge and damage was only discovered on December 27, 1959 [7]. The provisional claim was filed just eight days after the discovery of damage [8]. Citing *Consunji v. Manila Port Service* and *Rizal Surety v. Manila Railroad Co.*, the Court held that a liberal interpretation applies to promote fairness when the consignee learns of the loss only after the lapse of the 15-day period [9, 10]. The claim was deemed substantially compliant, and the suit was filed within one year of rejection [11].

2. **NO.** The Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' refusal to pass upon the issue of limited liability because it was not properly raised before the trial court [12]. A special defense must be specifically pleaded to afford the trial court an opportunity to rule on it [12]. While the petitioners' answer mentioned the Management Contract generally, it did not specifically allege the defense of limited liability, nor was it raised in the "partial stipulation of facts" [13]. Issues not raised in the lower court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal [12].

Petition is denied. The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [12, 14].
