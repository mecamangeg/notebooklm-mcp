I. CAPTION
MELECIO ROSARIO and ROMEO C. RAMIREZ v. TAYUG RURAL BANK, INC., G.R. No. L-26538, March 21, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Appellees Melecio Rosario and Romeo Ramirez sought to redeem a parcel of land covered by TCT No. 9562, which was mortgaged to appellant Tayug Rural Bank. The Bank extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage under Act 3135 [1]. The public auction took place on July 21, 1961, and the certificate of sale was issued on the same day [1]. However, the certificate of sale was recorded in the Registry of Deeds only on November 16, 1962 [1].

On November 7, 1963, Ramirez offered to redeem the property by tendering payment, but the Bank refused, contending that the one-year redemption period had commenced on the date of the auction sale (July 21, 1961) and had already expired [1]. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of the appellees, ordering the Bank to permit the redemption [2]. The Bank appealed, raising the legal question of when the redemption period should be reckoned [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the one-year redemption period in an extrajudicial foreclosure of registered land starts from the date of the auction sale.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that the redemption period is reckoned from the date of the registration of the certificate of sale, not the date of the auction [4, 5].

The Court held that Section 6 of Act 3135 must be applied together with Section 27, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court and Section 50 of the Land Registration Act (Act 496) [6]. Section 27, Rule 39 makes the registration of the sheriff's certificate of sale a mandatory requirement [5]. Under Section 50 of Act 496, the act of registration is the "operative act" to convey and affect registered land [5]. Consequently, the redemption period for registered land sold at an extrajudicial foreclosure begins only upon the registration of the certificate of sale in the office of the Register of Deeds [5]. This requirement ensures constructive notice to third parties and redemptioners [7].

Since the certificate was registered on November 16, 1962, the appellees' offer to redeem on November 7, 1963, was well within the one-year period [1, 5]. Judgment affirmed [8].
