I. CAPTION
BIENVENIDO CAPULONG v. ACTING COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-22991, January 16, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On October 8, 1954, Petitioner Capulong imported packages of merchandise (taroes, salted fish, and ham) from Hong Kong through the no-dollar remittance system. He failed to produce the Central Bank (CB) release certificate and import license required by CB Circulars Nos. 44 and 45. Consequently, seizure proceedings were instituted against him under Section 1363 of the Revised Administrative Code. The goods were released upon his filing of a surety bond worth P18,852.00. The Commissioner of Customs later ordered the confiscation of the bond value for violation of the circulars. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the decision. Petitioner appealed, admitting the violation but arguing that liabilities under Circulars 44 and 45 were abrogated by the subsequent CB Circular No. 133, and that such violations are not punishable by forfeiture [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N goods imported on a no-dollar basis in violation of CB Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 are subject to forfeiture despite the issuance of CB Circular No. 133.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that goods imported in violation of CB Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 are subject to forfeiture under Section 1363 of the Revised Administrative Code (now Section 2530[f] of the Tariff and Customs Code) [4, 5]. The Court reiterated that liabilities incurred by reason of violating said circulars were not abrogated by the promulgation of CB Circular No. 133 [4, 5].

Even goods brought to the Philippines on a "no-dollar import basis" were required to have a release certificate. The rationale is that practically all imports represent either an "immediate demand... or a potential demand of exchange," and the Central Bank requires this data to know the precise volume of imports for policy formulation [6-8]. Therefore, the importation of goods without the corresponding release certificate constituted a violation of the law punishable by forfeiture [8].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [9].
