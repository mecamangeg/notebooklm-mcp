I. CAPTION
LAND SETTLEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION v. AGUSTIN CARLOS, G.R. No. L-19752, January 29, 1968, 22 SCRA 202, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On October 11, 1952, respondent Agustin Carlos purchased a tractor from petitioner Land Settlement and Development Corporation (LASEDECO) for P9,000.00 under a contract of sale with chattel mortgage [1]. Carlos paid P2,250.00 down, with the balance due on November 10, 1952. On November 3, 1952, Carlos assigned his rights to Nicanor Carag and Pio Calica without LASEDECO's consent. Carag and Calica subsequently sold the tractor to Central Azucarera de Tarlac, which then sold it to Tarlac Development Corporation (TDC) [2, 3].

When Carlos failed to pay the balance, LASEDECO filed an action for specific performance (not foreclosure) against him [1]. The lower court ruled in favor of LASEDECO, ordering Carlos to pay the balance. During execution, the sheriff levied on the tractor found in TDC's possession [3]. TDC filed an *ex parte* motion to lift the attachment/third-party claim, arguing it was the owner in good faith and not a party to the case [3]. The trial court granted the motion and ordered the tractor returned to TDC. LASEDECO appealed, arguing Carlos could not validly assign the tractor without its consent [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the assignment of the tractor by Carlos to third parties was valid despite the lack of consent from LASEDECO.
2. W/N the tractor in the possession of TDC could be levied upon to satisfy the judgment for specific performance against Carlos.
3. W/N the trial court erred in granting the *ex parte* motion to lift the attachment.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The transaction between LASEDECO and Carlos was a straight contract of sale, not a sale on installments, as the balance was payable in its totality by a specific date [5]. Consequently, ownership transferred to Carlos upon delivery, subject only to the chattel mortgage lien. As the owner, Carlos could validly assign his rights to third parties even without LASEDECO's consent [6].

2. **NO.** While the assignment did not initially extinguish LASEDECO's mortgage lien, the Court held that LASEDECO effectively abandoned this lien by instituting a complaint for specific performance rather than foreclosure [6]. Since the remedy chosen was specific performance, the action was *in personam* against Carlos. The tractor, having been validly sold to TDC (a purchaser in good faith), no longer belonged to the judgment debtor and thus could not be levied upon to satisfy the judgment [7].

3. **YES.** A third person may object to a levy by filing a third-party claim. The Court found that TDC's motion effectively served as a third-party claim under Section 14, Rule 59 and Section 15, Rule 39 of the old Rules of Court [8]. Although the motion initially lacked a supporting affidavit of title, this defect was cured when the lower court admitted TDC's bill of sale as evidence without objection [9].

The orders of the lower court are **AFFIRMED**.
