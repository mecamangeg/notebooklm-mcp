I. CAPTION
CALTEX (PHILIPPINES), INC., plaintiff-appellant, v. MANILA PORT SERVICE, ET AL., defendants-appellees, G.R. No. L-24910, February 17, 1968, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
Caltex (Philippines), Inc. was the consignee of various imported articles under four separate bills of lading. The Manila Port Service (MPS), as the arrastre operator, received the shipments but failed to deliver certain items or delivered them in short:
1.  **Bill of Lading No. 27 (SS "Roseville"):** Discharged Dec. 9, 1961. Short 2 drums of oil worth P929.64. Formal claim filed Feb. 22, 1962 [1].
2.  **Bill of Lading No. 1 (SS "Fernbay"):** Discharged Mar. 27, 1962. Short 1 drum of oil worth P149.92. Provisional claim filed Mar. 30, 1962; formal claim Mar. 31, 1962 [2].
3.  **Bill of Lading No. 27 (SS "Fernbay"):** Discharged Mar. 27, 1962. Short 1 drum of oil worth P595.43. Provisional claim filed Mar. 30, 1962; formal claim Mar. 31, 1962 [2].
4.  **Bill of Lading No. 142 (SS "Nicoline Maersk"):** Discharged Dec. 27, 1961. Short 1 case of machinery parts worth P6,027.66. Provisional claim filed Jan. 3, 1962 [3].

Caltex filed suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI absolved MPS of liability for all claims [4]. It ruled that regarding the first three claims, Caltex failed to file claims within the 15-day period prescribed by Section 15 of the Arrastre Management Contract. For the fourth claim, the CFI held that the amount was not proved [4]. Caltex appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1.  W/N Caltex complied with Section 15 of the Arrastre Management Contract regarding the filing of claims within the 15-day period.
2.  W/N MPS is liable for the nondelivery of the case of machinery parts despite the lower court's finding that the amount was not proved.

IV. RULING
1.  **YES, but only for two of the claims.** The Court ruled that for the claims of P149.92 and P595.43, Caltex filed *provisional claims* within the 15-day period from the discharge of goods [6]. Citing *Domestic Insurance Company of the Philippines v. Manila Railroad Company*, the Court held that such provisional claims are substantial compliance with Section 15 of the Management Contract [6]. However, for the claim of P929.64, the formal claim was filed on February 22, 1962, which was more than 15 days after the discharge on December 9, 1961. The failure to file either a formal or provisional claim within the period is fatal to the action, even if the suit is brought within one year [7].

2.  **YES.** The Court held that the lower court erred in absolving MPS for the P6,027.66 claim. While the complaint alleged the value and the answer denied it, the stipulation of facts showed MPS admitted receiving the case and failing to deliver it [8]. Furthermore, the stipulation stated that the defendant's maximum liability is limited to P500.00. This limitation implies an admission of liability up to that amount [8].

Since the value of the shipments was not declared in the manifests or bills of lading, liability is limited to P500.00 per package under Section 15 of the contract [6]. Consequently, MPS is liable for P149.92 (full value as it is under P500), P500.00 (for the P595.43 claim), and P500.00 (for the P6,027.66 claim).

**WHEREFORE**, the judgment appealed from is **MODIFIED**. The Manila Port Service is hereby ordered to pay to Caltex (Philippines), Inc. the total sum of P1,149.92 [9].
