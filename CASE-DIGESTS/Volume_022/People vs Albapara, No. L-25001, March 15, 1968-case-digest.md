I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RODOLFO ALBAPARA Y BORDEOS, CONRADO REYES Y BARTOLOME and LUIS OBSUM Y JORDAN**, G.R. No. L-25001, March 15, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On July 8, 1963, during a labor strike at the Pier Area in South Harbor, Manila, a jeepney carrying "scabs" (strike-breakers) arrived at Gate 1 around 4:30 A.M. [1, 2]. Striking unionists encircled the vehicle, and moments later, several explosions occurred inside and around the jeepney [2]. Two passengers, Edgardo Ago and Encarnado Gonzales, died from blasting injuries, while passengers Eleuterio Ronquillo and Ambrosio Malinis sustained physical injuries [2-4]. The driver, Angelito Camia, was stabbed with an ice pick [5].

Patrolmen Marquez and Lalisa, who were on duty, arrested strikers Rodolfo Albapara, Conrado Reyes, and Luis Obsum on the spot [5]. Marquez testified seeing Obsum and Albapara throw bombs, while Lalisa saw Reyes throw a bomb [6-8]. The Court of First Instance of Manila convicted the three accused of double murder with multiple frustrated murder, sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua* [9]. The accused appealed, challenging the credibility of the police witnesses by pointing out inconsistencies in their testimonies regarding their relative positions and the sequence of explosions [10, 11].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt despite alleged inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.
2. W/N the accused are criminally liable for the frustrated murder of the jeepney driver, Angelito Camia.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the conviction regarding the deaths and injuries caused by the explosions. The trial court's judgment as to the credibility of witnesses is generally accepted on appeal [10]. The alleged discrepancies in the policemen's accounts—such as their exact positions or the precise source of every explosion—were minor and did not impair their credibility [12]. The Court held that considering the rapid sequence of abnormal events, it is not unusual for witnesses to retain individual impressions [12]. Differences in details serve to enhance rather than destroy credibility, as they indicate the witnesses were not coached [12]. Moreover, the police officers had no motive to falsely impute such a grave offense on the defendants [13].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that there was no evidence pointing to any of the accused as responsible for the stabbing of the driver, Angelito Camia, with an ice pick [13]. Consequently, the accused cannot be held liable for the frustrated murder of Camia.

**Judgment modified.** The accused are ACQUITTED of the frustrated murder of Camia; the judgment is AFFIRMED in all other respects, with the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* imposed due to the lack of necessary votes for the death penalty [14].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L. (Actg. C.J.), Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred [15]. Chief Justice Concepcion was on leave.
