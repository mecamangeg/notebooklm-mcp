I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RICARDO ATENCIO, SILVESTRE COLISAO, and DOMINGO ATENCIO, G.R. No. L-22518, January 17, 1968, 22 SCRA 88, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On the night of December 7, 1961, in Bobon, Samar, accused Ricardo Atencio, Domingo Atencio, and Silvestre Colisao, armed with bolos, invited Bonifacio Gremio to join them. On the way, Ricardo revealed their plan to rob Gerardo Rapsing. Despite Gremio's objection, he was forced to join but instructed to stay downstairs while the three accused entered Rapsing’s house. Gremio heard hacking sounds. The following morning, Rapsing (75), his nephew Sebastian (15), and helper Daniel Rosita were found dead from chopping wounds.

Ricardo Atencio executed an extrajudicial confession but later repudiated it, claiming maltreatment and alibi. Domingo Atencio was arrested wearing a stolen shirt, and other stolen items were found on Ricardo's farm. Gremio was discharged as a state witness and testified against the others. The Court of First Instance convicted all three of robbery with triple homicide, sentencing them to death, finding the aggravating circumstances of band, evident premeditation, treachery, dwelling, and nocturnity. The case was elevated on automatic review.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the testimony of a co-conspirator (Gremio) is admissible to prove conspiracy against the other accused.
2. W/N the aggravating circumstances of band, evident premeditation, treachery, and dwelling were correctly appreciated.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the rule stating "the act or declaration of a conspirator relating to the conspiracy... applies only to extrajudicial acts or declaration, but not to testimony given on the stand at the trial." Since Gremio testified in court as an eyewitness and was subject to cross-examination by the defense, his testimony identifying the accused and detailing their participation was admissible to establish the conspiracy [1, 2].

2. **PARTIALLY.**
*   **Band:** **NO.** For the circumstance of *cuadrilla* to exist, there must be more than three armed malefactors. Since Gremio was unarmed, only three (the Atencios and Colisao) were armed; thus, they did not constitute a band [3].
*   **Evident Premeditation:** **NO.** This is inherent in robbery unless there is proof of a specific plan to kill distinct from the plan to rob [4].
*   **Treachery:** **YES.** The victims were killed while asleep or immediately upon waking, leaving them unable to defend themselves [5].
*   **Dwelling:** **YES.** While inherent in simple robbery, dwelling is aggravating in robbery with violence against persons because the crime can be committed without violating the victim's abode [6].
*   **Nocturnity:** **YES.** The accused purposely sought nighttime to ensure the crime's consummation with minimum resistance [7].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** with modification. Accused Ricardo Atencio is sentenced to **DEATH**. Due to lack of necessary votes, the penalty for Domingo Atencio and Silvestre Colisao is reduced to **Reclusion Perpetua**. All are ordered to indemnify the heirs of the victims [8].
