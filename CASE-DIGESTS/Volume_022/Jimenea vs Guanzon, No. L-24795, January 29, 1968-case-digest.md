I. CAPTION
PEDRO JIMENEA v. ROMEO G. GUANZON, ABELARDO SUBIDO, and LUIS GADOR, G.R. No. L-24795, January 29, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pedro Jimenea, a civil service eligible, was appointed as "provisional" Second Class Patrolman in Bacolod City by outgoing Mayor Cordova on November 20, 1963, shortly after Cordova lost the election to Respondent Romeo Guanzon [1, 2]. Upon assuming office, Mayor Guanzon requested the Civil Service Commissioner to revoke the appointment, citing the existence of eligibles with higher ratings [3]. Commissioner Abelardo Subido approved Jimenea's appointment as merely "temporary" [3]. Consequently, Mayor Guanzon terminated Jimenea’s services on May 20, 1964 and appointed Luis Gador in his stead [4]. Jimenea filed a petition for mandamus and prohibition, claiming his appointment was permanent and he had security of tenure. The Court of First Instance dismissed the petition [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appointment extended to Jimenea was permanent.
2. W/N Jimenea is entitled to security of tenure.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the appointment was temporary. Under Section 24(c) of the Civil Service Act of 1959 (R.A. 2260), a "provisional" appointment requires that there be no appropriate register of eligibles [6]. Since Jimenea was eligible, the designation of "provisional" was technically erroneous; however, the circumstances—specifically the appointment by an outgoing mayor—indicated an intent to make the appointment temporary to afford the incoming mayor the chance to retain or replace the appointee [7-9]. Furthermore, under Section 20 of R.A. 2260, the Civil Service Commissioner has the power to review appointments within 180 days [10]. Commissioner Subido acted within his authority when he corrected the appointment from "provisional" to "temporary" to reflect its true nature within this period [11].

2. **NO.** A civil service eligible who accepts a position in a temporary capacity is not entitled to security of tenure guaranteed by the Constitution or R.A. 557 [12]. One who holds a temporary appointment acts at the pleasure of the appointing power and may be terminated at any time without cause [12]. As Jimenea's appointment was temporary, he acquired no vested right to the office [11].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
