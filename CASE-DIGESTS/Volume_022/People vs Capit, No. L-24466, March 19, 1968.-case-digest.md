I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JAIME CAPITO, TOMAS SUPAT, CELESTINO COLLADO, and CESAR MARATA, G.R. No. L-24466, March 19, 1968, 22 SCRA 1130, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On February 20, 1963, at midnight, in Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte, the house of spouses Hadji Mohamad Nol Akil and Amina Sapihi was robbed. While the family was asleep, two men entered; one was identified as Jaime Capito and the other as appellant Tomas Supat. They attacked Hadji Akil, who was subsequently shot and killed. Amina saw appellants Celestino Collado and Cesar Marata in another room hogtying the children. The robbers took valuables worth P840.00 and firearms.

The house was well-lighted by three big kerosene lamps. Witnesses positively identified the appellants: Amina recognized Supat because he had visited their house a week earlier to sell a firearm; Abdul Salam Akil recognized Marata (a basketball acquaintance) when his mask fell off; and Collado was recognized when his face was exposed to the light. The appellants raised the defense of alibi, claiming they were elsewhere (Dipolog or their respective homes) during the crime. The Court of First Instance convicted Supat, Collado, and Marata of robbery with homicide but acquitted Capito on reasonable doubt. The three convicted accused appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appellants' defense of alibi can prevail over their positive identification by the prosecution witnesses.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court ruled that alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused by witnesses who had no motive to testify falsely. In this case, the inmates of the house had full opportunity to observe the intruders because the house was well-lighted and they were familiar with the appellants' faces [1]. Supat was a friend who had previously shared food with the victim; Collado had been seen in the house on previous occasions; and Marata was a neighbor whose mask fell off during the struggle [1], [2].

Furthermore, the Court held that the conspiracy among the appellants was evident from their collective acts, which demonstrated a common design to accomplish the unlawful purpose [3]. Although only two intruders perpetrated the killing, all appellants are liable for the complex crime of robbery with homicide because the killing bore a direct relation to the robbery [3]. The alibis were deemed unreliable and fabricated, failing to meet the requirement of proving physical impossibility of presence at the crime scene [4], [2].

The decision of the lower court was **AFFIRMED**.
