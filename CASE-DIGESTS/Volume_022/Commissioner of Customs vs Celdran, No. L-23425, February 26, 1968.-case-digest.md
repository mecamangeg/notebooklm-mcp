I. CAPTION
THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS and THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. MIGUEL FORTICH CELDRAN and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-23425, February 26, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
In October 1960, respondent Miguel Fortich Celdran, a physician returning from a two-year stay in the United States, arrived in Cebu bringing a 1959 Chevrolet Impala car. The Collector of Customs of Cebu exempted the car from customs duties under Section 105(i) of the Tariff and Customs Code but assessed a special import tax and compensating tax totaling over P12,000 [1]. These taxes were computed based on the car's "red book" or published retail factory price ($2,717.00) rather than its invoice value ($2,150.00), and included a 25% margin fee in the tax base [2, 3]. Celdran paid under protest. After his protest was overruled by the Collector and the Commissioner of Customs, he appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [1]. The CTA ruled in Celdran's favor, eliminating the 25% margin fee from the computation and setting the taxable value at the invoice price of $2,150.00 [4]. The Commissioners of Customs and Internal Revenue appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 25% margin fee should be added to the tax base of the imported car.
2. W/N the taxable value of the car should be based on its invoice price ($2,150.00) rather than the published retail factory price ($2,717.00).

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The 25% margin fee cannot be imposed because there was no sale of foreign exchange by the Central Bank or its agents. Under Republic Act No. 2609 and Central Bank Circular No. 95, the margin fee applies only to "sales of foreign exchange" by authorized agent banks [5, 6]. Celdran purchased the car in the United States using savings from his earnings abroad; thus, no foreign exchange was sold or purchased in the Philippines involving any agent bank [6, 7]. Since no dollars went out of the country and no foreign exchange sale occurred, the margin fee does not apply [8].

2. **YES.** The tax must be based on the invoice value of $2,150.00. While Finance Department Order No. 289-A allows appraisers to use the "published retail factory price" if the actual price is not known or questionable, it primarily requires evaluation based on the actual purchase price [3, 9]. Here, Celdran presented a certified "Bill of Sale" and a consular invoice verified by the Philippine Consulate in New York stating the price as $2,150.00 [10]. The Court held that the public character of these documents entitles them to faith and credence, and there was no evidence that the invoice price was not the actual purchase price [11, 12]. Furthermore, the Customs Appraiser failed to make a specific "report" justifying a value higher than the invoice price as required by Section 1405 of the Tariff and Customs Code [12, 13].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED [14].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred with the decision [14].
