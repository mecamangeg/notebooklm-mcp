I. CAPTION
RIZAL SURETY & INSURANCE CO. v. MACONDRAY & CO., INC., G.R. No. L-24064, February 29, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Rizal Surety & Insurance Co. (Petitioner) sought to recover P2,000.00 from Macondray & Co., Inc. (Respondent), the Manila agent of Barber Steamship Line Inc. The amount represented the value of machinery parts shipped on the "SS Tai Ping" from New York, consigned to Edwardson Manufacturing Corporation in Manila [1]. The goods were insured by Petitioner but were not discharged by the vessel upon its arrival in Manila [1]. Consequently, Petitioner paid the insurance claim to the consignee and filed a suit against Respondent on February 10, 1964 [2].

Respondent moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of prescription, arguing that under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), the action must be filed within one year [3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila sustained the defense and dismissed the complaint [1], [3]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the one-year period does not apply when goods are not discharged at all, and that the general statute of limitations should apply instead [4].

The vessel "SS Tai Ping" arrived in Manila on November 2, 1962, and left on November 4, 1962 [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action to recover the value of the undelivered goods is barred by the one-year prescriptive period under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA).

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal, holding that the action had prescribed.

The Court ruled that Section 3(6), Title I of the COGSA applies not only to damage but also to loss [4]. The provision anticipates two possibilities for computing the prescriptive period: (1) if delivery is made, the action must be brought within one year after delivery; or (2) if no delivery is made, the period runs from "the date when the goods should have been delivered" [5], [4].

In this case, since the goods were not discharged, the period is computed from the date they should have been delivered. The vessel arrived in Manila on November 2, 1962, and left on November 4, 1962. The Court determined that November 4, 1962, was the last opportunity for the carrier to deliver the goods [2]. Therefore, the one-year period commenced on November 5, 1962, and expired on November 4, 1963 [2]. Since the action was commenced only on February 10, 1964, it was filed beyond the prescriptive period [2]. Furthermore, the Bill of Lading expressly stipulated that it was subject to the provisions of COGSA, making it the law between the parties [2].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [6].
