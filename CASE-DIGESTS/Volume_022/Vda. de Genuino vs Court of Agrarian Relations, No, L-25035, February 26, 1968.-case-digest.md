I. CAPTION
EDWARDA S. VDA. DE GENUINO v. THE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, BENIGNO MANABAT, et al., G.R. No. L-25035, February 26, 1968, 22 SCRA 792, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Eduarda S. Vda. de Genuino, the judicial administratrix of an estate comprising agricultural lands in Candaba, Pampanga, was sued by her share tenants in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) [1]. The tenants sought to change their tenancy arrangement from share tenancy to leasehold tenancy [2]. Petitioner moved to dismiss the complaints, questioning the constitutionality of the Agricultural Land Reform Code (R.A. 3844), specifically arguing that the abolition of share tenancy and the compulsion to enter into leasehold contracts violated her freedom of contract and property rights without due process [3].

The CAR denied the motion, ruling that even if the challenged provisions of R.A. 3844 were unconstitutional, Section 14 of R.A. 1199 (Agricultural Tenancy Act) validly grants tenants the option to choose the leasehold system [2]. The CAR subsequently authorized the leasehold system. Petitioner appealed, further arguing that the rentals fixed by the court, which yielded a return of only 3.42% to 4.56% based on stipulated facts, amounted to a confiscation of property [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the abolition of share tenancy and the compulsion to accept the leasehold system violate the constitutional freedom of contract and due process.
2. W/N the fixed rentals constitute confiscation of property requiring just compensation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Agricultural Land Reform Code is justified by the right of the State to exercise its **police power** [3]. Individual rights to contract and property must give way to police power exercised for public welfare [5]. The Court held that police power is broad enough to be exercised on the basis of economic need for the public welfare [6]. Furthermore, Section 14 of R.A. 1199, which allows the tenant to choose the leasehold relationship, has already been declared constitutional in prior cases like *Gamboa v. Pallarca* [7]. Thus, regardless of the validity of the Land Reform Code, the petitioner must submit to the change of system [8].

2. **NO.** **Just compensation is not required in the exercise of police power** [4]. The Court rejected the argument that the low return on investment amounted to confiscation without due process [9]. The Court emphasized that the constitutionality of a law cannot be made to depend on a conclusion based on a stipulation of facts entered into by the parties; otherwise, a law could be constitutional in some cases and unconstitutional in others [10], [4]. Since the tenants did not appeal the rental computation, the lower court's decision was upheld [11].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [11].
