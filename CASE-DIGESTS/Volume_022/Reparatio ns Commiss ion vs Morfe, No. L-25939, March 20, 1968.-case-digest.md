I. CAPTION
REPARATIONS COMMISSION v. HON. JUDGE JESUS P. MORFE and INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS, INC., G.R. No. L-25939, March 20, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Industrial Chemicals, Inc. obtained a reparations allocation of $6.5 million for a Soda Ash Plant project. Contracts were signed on June 15, 1961. Subsequently, R.A. No. 3079 took effect, imposing new requirements on reparations. Industrial Chemicals intervened in Civil Case No. 55689, seeking to compel the Reparations Commission (REPACOM) to implement its procurement orders using the official exchange rate (P2.00 to US$1.00) rather than the free market rate.

On January 21, 1966, the trial court (presided by Judge Morfe) rendered a decision in favor of Industrial Chemicals, ordering REPACOM to take preliminary steps for full implementation of the procurement orders. REPACOM filed a notice of appeal on February 16, 1966. Two days later, Industrial Chemicals moved to amend the judgment and for special execution. The trial court granted this motion, amending the decision and issuing a writ of mandatory and preventive injunction for immediate execution. REPACOM filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the lower court lost jurisdiction upon the filing of the notice of appeal and gravely abused its discretion in ordering execution pending appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court had jurisdiction to amend the decision and order execution pending appeal despite the filing of a notice of appeal.
2. W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in ordering the immediate execution of the judgment in an injunction case.
3. W/N the new requirements of R.A. No. 3079 apply to the subject allocation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The appeal had not yet been perfected because the record on appeal was still pending approval in the lower court [1]. The case was an ordinary action for specific performance (injunction), not a special civil action where a record on appeal is unnecessary [1]. Thus, the court retained jurisdiction to issue the orders.

2. **NO.** Rule 39, Sec. 4 of the Rules of Court expressly provides for the immediate execution of judgments rendered in injunction cases notwithstanding the pendency of an appeal [2]. The trial court has discretion to stay or refuse to stay such execution, and REPACOM failed to clearly establish any grave abuse of this discretion [2]. The mandatory injunction merely preserved the status quo of the pre-existing relationship and did not definitely commit the government to specific machineries, but only to take preliminary steps [3].

3. **NO.** Citing *Botelho Shipping Corp. v. Leuterio*, the Court held that R.A. No. 3079, which imposed new and additional requirements, does not apply retroactively to allocations approved before the law's passage on June 17, 1961 [4]. Industrial Chemicals' allocation was approved and the contract signed prior to this date.

Petition dismissed [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
