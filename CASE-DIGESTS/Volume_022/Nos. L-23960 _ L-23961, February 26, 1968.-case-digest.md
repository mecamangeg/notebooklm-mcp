I. CAPTION
DIWA NG PAGKAKAISA-PAFLU v. FILTEX INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION and THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. Nos. L-23960 & L-23961, February 26, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On October 20, 1967, the Supreme Court issued a resolution ordering respondent Filtex International Corporation (Filtex) to reinstate, pending appeal, the strikers-members of petitioner union who were not found responsible for the strike by the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [1]. Filtex received notice on October 25, 1967, giving it until November 24, 1967, to comply, but failed to do so [2]. Petitioner filed a motion to cite Filtex for contempt [1]. Filtex admitted its failure to reinstate but argued it was in a dilemma, fearing that dismissing the current employees hired as replacements would violate labor laws regarding separation pay and expose the company to lawsuits [3]. Filtex also claimed it had already reinstated some strikers prior to the order, but this was unproven and contrary to its previous stance [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Filtex's refusal to reinstate the strikers constitutes contempt of court despite its alleged fear of violating labor laws regarding replacement workers.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Filtex is guilty of contempt. The Court held that the respondent's fear of violating labor laws or being sued by dismissed replacements is untenable [6]. The dismissal of replacement employees to comply with a court reinstatement order is legal [6]. Replacement workers are deemed to have accepted their employment with the knowledge that it is subject to the outcome of the labor dispute (*Norton & Harrison Co., etc., Labor Union v. Norton & Harrison Co.*) [6]. Moreover, Filtex could have satisfied the separation pay law by giving one-month notice or paying one-month salary within the compliance period provided by the Court [7].

Respondent Filtex is found guilty of contempt, fined P1,000.00, and ordered to reinstate the laborers immediately, with a penalty of P100.00 for every day of delay [7].
