I. CAPTION
EUFRACIO FAGTANAC and DOLORES ADVINCULA v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, MATILDE FALCIS and FEDERICO MENDOZA, G.R. Nos. L-26922 and L-26923, March 21, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Fagtanac and Advincula prevailed in a joint trial for a civil case (ownership) and a land registration case in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Capiz against private respondents Falcis and Mendoza. Respondents appealed. On September 22, 1965, the CFI ordered respondents to amend their record on appeal (ROA) in the land registration case to include specific orders and motions. Respondents received this order on September 29, 1965, but failed to comply or redraft the ROA.

On January 3, 1966, petitioners moved to dismiss the appeal in the CFI for failure to prosecute, but the CFI denied it for loss of jurisdiction. Petitioners then filed a motion to dismiss with the Court of Appeals (CA) on July 7, 1966, citing failure to prosecute and defective ROAs. The ROAs were only forwarded to the CA on July 25, 1966—nearly ten months after the order to amend—and were still incomplete and unapproved. The CA denied the motion to dismiss. Petitioners filed this petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to dismiss the appeal for failure to prosecute.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion. Under Section 3, Rule 46 of the Rules of Court, an appeal may be declared abandoned for failure to prosecute. While the appellate court has discretion under Rule 50, Section 1, the negligence of private respondents was "palpably clear" [1, 2].

The Court found a clear failure to prosecute based on three circumstances:
1.  **Failure to amend the Record on Appeal:** Respondents ignored the trial court's order of September 22, 1965, to include specific matters in the ROA. No redrafted ROA was ever presented or approved as required by Section 7, Rule 41 [3, 4].
2.  **Defective Certification:** Respondents failed to ensure the ROAs bore the trial court's approval and the Clerk of Court's certification of correctness required by Section 10, Rule 41. It is the appellant's duty to diligently prosecute their appeal and compel the Clerk to act; they cannot merely rely on the Clerk to transmit the records [5, 6].
3.  **Unreasonable Delay:** The records were not elevated to the CA until ten months after the order to amend was received. This delay shackled the administration of justice [2, 4].

The petition is **GRANTED**, and the Court of Appeals is directed to dismiss the appeals in Civil Case No. V-661 and Land Registration Case No. N-50.
