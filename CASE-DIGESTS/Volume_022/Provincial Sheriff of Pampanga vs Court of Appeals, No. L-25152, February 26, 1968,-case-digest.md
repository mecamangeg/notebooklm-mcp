I. CAPTION
THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF PAMPANGA, CIRILO D. CABRAL and ZACARIAS PEREZ v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS and MARCIANO AGUSTIN, G.R. No. L-25152, February 26, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On June 4, 1960, petitioners Cirilo Cabral and Zacarias Perez filed a collection suit against Elpidio Agustin [1]. While the case was pending, Elpidio's "Modern Furniture Store" and its contents were totally destroyed by fire on January 9, 1961 [1]. Elpidio surrendered his license, and shortly thereafter, his brother, respondent Marciano Agustin, established a new store on the same site using the same name [2]. Elpidio verbally transferred the trade name "Modern Furniture Store" to Marciano [2].

After the Court of First Instance rendered judgment against Elpidio, a writ of execution was issued [2, 3]. The Provincial Sheriff levied on the furniture found in Marciano's store [3]. Marciano filed a third-party claim asserting ownership, but the Sheriff proceeded to schedule the sale after the creditors posted a bond [3]. Marciano filed an action to be declared the owner of the items [4]. The trial court dismissed Marciano's complaint, but the Court of Appeals reversed the decision, declaring Marciano the owner and awarding damages [4]. The petitioners appealed, invoking the presumption of fraud under Article 1387 of the Civil Code [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the presumption of alienation in fraud of creditors under Article 1387 of the Civil Code applies to the verbal transfer of the business name "Modern Furniture Store."

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, ruling that Article 1387 of the New Civil Code applies only when there has in fact been an alienation or transfer of property, whether gratuitously or by onerous title [5, 6].

The Court found that the original store and furniture belonging to the debtor, Elpidio, were totally destroyed by fire; thus, the furniture levied upon in the new store belonged exclusively to Marciano and was acquired with his own capital [6]. The verbal transfer between the brothers referred only to the business name and style, not the store or its contents [6]. Since there was no transfer of the physical store or furniture, the presumption of fraud under Article 1387 does not apply, and the transfer of the trade name has no effect on Marciano’s ownership of the furniture in question [7].

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
