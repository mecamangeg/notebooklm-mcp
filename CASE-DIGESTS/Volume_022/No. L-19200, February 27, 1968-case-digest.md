I. CAPTION
EMILIO SY v. THE HON. JUDGE MANUEL DALMAN and JOSEFA VDA. DE RAMOS, G.R. No. L-19200, February 27, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Josefa Vda. de Ramos (respondent) owned a building on land that was forfeited to the government and subsequently sold at public auction to Emilio Sy (petitioner) on March 31, 1960 [1, 2]. Sy agreed to pay the value of the building in five annual installments and paid the first two [2]. However, Sy failed to pay the subsequent monthly rentals of P250.00 each [3]. Consequently, Ramos filed a case for unlawful detainer against Sy in the Justice of the Peace Court of Dipolog [3]. Sy moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction because he was already the owner of the building and land, making the issue one of ownership rather than mere possession [4, 5]. The Justice of the Peace Court denied the motion [4]. Sy filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zamboanga del Norte, alleging grave abuse of discretion [6]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the lower court had exclusive original jurisdiction [5, 7]. Sy appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Justice of the Peace Court has jurisdiction over the unlawful detainer case despite the defendant's claim of ownership over the property.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the CFI. The Court ruled that in ejectment cases, jurisdiction is determined by the nature of the action as pleaded in the complaint [5]. The appellant's claim of title over the building does not necessarily defeat the jurisdiction vested in the court by the allegations in the complaint; otherwise, the ends of justice would be frustrated by making the efficacy of the action depend entirely on the defendant [8].

The Court noted an exception where evidence adduced at trial shows that the question of title is actually involved and must be resolved to decide the question of possession [8]. However, this case did not fall within the exception because the trial had not yet started, and Sy had immediately filed a motion to dismiss [8]. The claim of ownership is a matter of defense that should be determined from evidence at trial [9]. Furthermore, the Court held that an order denying a motion to dismiss is interlocutory, and the proper remedy is to answer, go to trial, and appeal the judgment on the merits, rather than resorting to certiorari or prohibition [10].

Petition denied; Judgment affirmed.
