**I. CAPTION**
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FELIX B. ACEBEDO, G.R. No. L-20477, March 29, 1968, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
On September 24, 1949, the Bureau of Internal Revenue issued a notice of assessment against Felix Acebedo for deficiency income tax for the year 1948 amounting to P5,962.83 [1]. Acebedo requested a reinvestigation on October 11, 1949, but there is no evidence this was acted upon [2]. Although a warrant of distraint and levy was issued on October 23, 1950, it was not followed up [2].

Acebedo made further requests for reinvestigation in 1951 and offered his books for examination in 1954 [2]. The Collector of Internal Revenue only replied on October 4, 1955—more than five years after the original assessment—requesting Acebedo to sign a waiver of the statute of limitations [2, 3]. Acebedo signed the waiver on December 17, 1959 [4]. The Republic filed the complaint for collection on December 27, 1961 [1]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription [5]. The Republic appealed, arguing the requests for reinvestigation suspended the period [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the requests for reinvestigation suspended the running of the prescriptive period for collection.
2. W/N the written waiver of the statute of limitations revived the government's right to collect.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** A mere request for reinvestigation or reconsideration of an assessment does not have the effect of suspending the prescriptive period [6]. While a taxpayer may be estopped from claiming prescription if their repeated requests persuaded the government to postpone collection, that did not occur here [7]. The delay could not be attributed to the defendant as his requests were unheeded and nothing impeded the government from enforcing the liability via distraint or levy within the period [3].

2. **NO.** Under Section 332(c) of the National Internal Revenue Code, an agreement to extend the period for collection must be made in writing *before* the expiration of the original five-year period [8]. The assessment was made in 1949; thus, the five-year period expired in 1954 [3]. The waiver signed by Acebedo on December 17, 1959, was executed after prescription had already set in and could not revive the right of action [3].

The Order of the Court of First Instance dismissing the complaint is **AFFIRMED** [9].
