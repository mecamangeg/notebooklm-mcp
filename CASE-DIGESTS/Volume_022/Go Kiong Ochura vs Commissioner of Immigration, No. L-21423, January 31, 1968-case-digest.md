I. CAPTION
GO KIONG OCHURA and GO ZUI OCHURA v. COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION and DEPORTATION OFFICER, BUREAU OF IMMIGRATION, G.R. No. L-21423, January 31, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Go Kiong Ochura and Go Zui Ochura arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on May 28, 1958, seeking admission as the legitimate sons of Filipino citizens Isaac Ochura and Chua Suy. The Board of Special Inquiry (BSI) initially admitted them [1]. However, upon review, the Board of Immigration Commissioners (BIC) unanimously reversed the BSI decision on December 5, 1958, finding a lack of evidence to establish filiation due to contradictions in the petitioners' testimonies regarding their family and home in China [2].

Petitioners moved for a rehearing. The BSI again voted to admit them, but the BIC reaffirmed its order of exclusion on July 10, 1959 [3]. Consequently, petitioners filed an action for prohibition and mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI ruled in favor of the petitioners, holding that their filiation was proved by a "preponderance of evidence" and restraining the execution of the exclusion order [3]. The respondents appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CFI erred in reversing the findings of the Board of Immigration Commissioners based on a preponderance of evidence.
2. W/N the petition is barred by the failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the CFI erred in treating the case as an ordinary civil action decided by a preponderance of evidence [4]. The fundamental tenet in judicial review is that executive decisions are conclusive on questions of fact and are not subject to review by courts in the absence of fraud, imposition, or mistake other than an error of judgment in estimating the value of evidence [5].

In immigration cases, courts cannot disturb the factual conclusions of immigration authorities as long as there is "some evidence" to support them (*Manabat v. De la Cruz*; *Ortua v. Singson Encarnacion*) [6]. Here, the BIC's decision was supported by substantial evidence, specifically the contradictions in the witnesses' testimonies, and thus should not have been disregarded by the lower court [7].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the petitioners violated the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies by failing to appeal the decision of the Board of Immigration Commissioners to the Secretary of Justice regarding their exclusion (*Soriano v. Galang*; *Board of Commissioners v. Domingo*) [8]. Consequently, the action for prohibition and mandamus should not lie.

**WHEREFORE**, the decision under appeal is reversed, and the appellees' action for prohibition and mandamus is ordered dismissed [8].
