I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FELIX B. ACEBEDO, G.R. No. L-20477, March 29, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
The Bureau of Internal Revenue assessed defendant Felix B. Acebedo for deficiency income tax for the year 1948 amounting to P5,962.83. The notice of assessment was issued on September 24, 1949 [1]. Acebedo requested a reinvestigation on October 11, 1949, and again on October 6, 1951, but the Collector of Internal Revenue did not act on these requests aside from issuing a warrant of distraint and levy in 1950 which was not followed up [2].

On October 4, 1955, more than five years after the assessment, the Collector finally replied, requiring Acebedo to execute a waiver of the statute of limitations [2, 3]. Acebedo signed the waiver on December 17, 1959 [4]. The Republic filed the complaint for collection on December 27, 1961 [1]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the government's right to collect the deficiency tax has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the order of dismissal, ruling that the action for collection was barred by the statute of limitations under Section 332(c) of the National Internal Revenue Code [5].

The Court held that the five-year prescriptive period for collection commenced from the assessment in 1949 and expired in 1954 [3]. The defendant's mere requests for reinvestigation did not suspend the running of the period because there was no evidence the Collector acted upon them or was persuaded to postpone collection based on such requests [2, 6].

Furthermore, the written waiver of the statute of limitations signed by the defendant on December 17, 1959, was ineffective. To be valid, a waiver must be executed within the original five-year period for collection. Since prescription had already set in by October 1955, the subsequent waiver could no longer revive the right of action [3].

The order appealed from is affirmed [7].
