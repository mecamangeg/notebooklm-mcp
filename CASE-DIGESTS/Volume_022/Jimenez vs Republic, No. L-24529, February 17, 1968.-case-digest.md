I. CAPTION
EDUARDO JIMENEZ v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and JUDGE PEDRO NAVARRO, G.R. No. L-24529, February 17, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jimenez was charged with homicide in Criminal Case No. 9531 before the Court of First Instance of Rizal [1]. The case was tried by Judge Eulogio Mencias, who prepared and signed the decision on January 16, 1965 [1]. Promulgation was set for January 21, 1965, but was cancelled because the date was declared a special holiday [1]. On that same day, January 21, Judge Mencias reached the age of 70 and retired from the bench [1]. Respondent Judge Pedro Navarro took his place and ordered the promulgation of the decision [1]. Jimenez filed a motion to set aside the decision, arguing that since Judge Mencias had retired, the decision was no longer the official act of a judge and could not be validly promulgated [2]. Judge Navarro denied the motion [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a decision signed by a judge is valid if promulgated after the judge has retired from the judiciary.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that for a judgment to be binding, it must be duly signed and promulgated during the incumbency of the judge who signed it [3].

The Court cited *Ong Siu v. Paredes* and *People v. So*, interpreting Section 6, Rule 120 of the Revised Rules of Court (formerly Section 6, Rule 116) [4], [3]. The rule allows a judgment to be promulgated in the absence of the judge who rendered it only when said judge is "absent or outside of the province or city" [5], [6]. The Court held that this provision refers to physical absence, not the cessation of office or retirement [7]. It is implied that for a decision to be validly read in the judge's absence, he must still be a judge of that court at the time of promulgation [7], [8]. Since Judge Mencias had retired prior to the attempted promulgation, the decision became null and void [9].

The decision rendered by the retired Judge Eulogio Mencias is declared NULL and VOID [9].
