I. CAPTION
BENEDICTO BALUYOT, ET AL. v. EULOGIO E. VENEGAS, G.R. No. L-22968, January 31, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On July 24, 1951, Crisanto Baluyot sold a parcel of land to Eulogio Venegas. The contract of sale contained a stipulation granting the vendor the option to repurchase the property "at anytime after the expiration of the period of ten (10) years to be computed from October 1, 1951" [1]. On July 18, 1963, roughly twelve years later, the heirs of Crisanto Baluyot (plaintiffs) filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bataan to compel Venegas to reconvey the land [1, 2]. The CFI rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, ordering Venegas to execute a deed of conveyance [3]. Venegas appealed, arguing that the stipulation giving the option to repurchase after ten years is void under Article 1606 of the Civil Code [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the stipulation allowing the right to repurchase to be exercised only after the lapse of ten years is valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the stipulation is void and not legally feasible [4]. Under Article 1606 of the Civil Code, the period for repurchase, in the presence of an agreement, cannot exceed ten years from the date of the contract [3, 4].

The Court explained that a stipulation which prohibits the exercise of the right to repurchase for the first ten years and allows it only *after* said period is illicit. It effectively attempts to suppress the right during the period the law allows it, and creates the right only when the law already prohibits it [4, 5]. Relying on *Santos vs. Heirs of Crisostomo and Tiongson* (41 Phil. 342), the Court ruled that since the right to repurchase was supposed to begin only after the statutory ten-year limit had expired, the right did not even arise as it was already interdicted by law [4, 5].

Furthermore, the Court rejected the plaintiffs' contention that this defense was a plea of prescription that should have been raised earlier. Article 1606 is not a statute of limitation but a rule of substantive law regarding the validity of the contract period [6, 7].

The judgment appealed from is **REVERSED** and the complaint is **DISMISSED** [7].
