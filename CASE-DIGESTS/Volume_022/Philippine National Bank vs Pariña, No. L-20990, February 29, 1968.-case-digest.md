I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. AGUSTIN PARIÑA, G.R. No. L-20990, February 29, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On November 28, 1950, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila rendered a decision ordering Agustin Pariña to pay the Philippine National Bank (PNB) specific sums of money [1]. After the judgment became final and remained unsatisfied, PNB filed a complaint on February 28, 1961, to revive the judgment [2]. Because Pariña's whereabouts were unknown, the trial court ordered summons by publication [3]. Pariña failed to file an answer and was declared in default [3]. The court-appointed Commissioner recommended the dismissal of the complaint on the ground of prescription, as the action was filed more than ten years after the 1950 judgment became final [4]. The trial court adopted the recommendation and dismissed the complaint [4]. PNB appealed, contending that the defense of prescription is deemed waived if not pleaded, and the defendant, being in default, failed to plead it [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may dismiss the complaint on the ground of prescription despite the defendant's failure to plead it due to default.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. While the general rule is that the defense of prescription is waived if not pleaded, this rule does not apply when the defendant's whereabouts are unknown and he is summoned by publication [6, 7]. Summons by publication is a constructive process, and it cannot be assumed that the defendant was actually aware of the complaint; thus, his failure to answer cannot be considered a waiver of his defenses [7-9]. Conversely, waiver applies if the summons is served personally [7]. Furthermore, under Article 24 of the New Civil Code, the court must take the initiative in protecting the rights of a party who is at a disadvantage and cannot assert their rights [6, 10]. Since PNB's own evidence showed the action to revive the judgment was filed beyond the ten-year prescriptive period, the trial court correctly dismissed the case *motu proprio* [5, 10].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [11].
