I. CAPTION
PHOENIX ASSURANCE CO., LTD. v. UNITED STATES LINES, G.R. No. L-24033, February 22, 1968, 22 SCRA 674, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
General Motors shipped truck spare parts from New York to Davao Parts and Service, Inc. in Davao City aboard the vessel SS "Pioneer Moor," operated by United States Lines. The shipment was covered by a short form Bill of Lading which incorporated the terms of the carrier's regular long form Bill of Lading [1]. The documents designated Manila as the port of discharge, with transshipment to Davao City [1, 2].

Upon arrival in Manila, United States Lines discharged the cargo into the custody of the Manila Port Service (MPS). While in the custody of MPS, two crates (Nos. 3648 and 3649) were lost [1, 3]. United States Lines refused to pay for the lost crates, contending its liability ceased upon discharge in Manila. Phoenix Assurance Co., Ltd., the insurer of the consignee, paid the claim of P552.12 and, as subrogee, filed suit against United States Lines [4, 5]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that the carrier was not liable for losses occurring outside its actual custody [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the carrier (United States Lines) is liable for the loss of cargo occurring while in the custody of the arrastre operator (MPS) at the port of discharge, pending transshipment to the final destination.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the Bill of Lading is the law between the parties and its validity must be sustained where not contrary to law or public policy [7].

The Court cited the specific provision in the long form Bill of Lading which stated: "The carrier shall not be liable in any capacity whatsoever for any loss or damage to the goods while the goods are not in its actual custody" [8, 9]. Since the goods were lost while in the possession of the Manila Port Service and not the carrier, United States Lines was not responsible [9]. Furthermore, the Bill of Lading stipulated that in matters of transshipment beyond the port of discharge (Manila), the carrier acted solely as the agent of the shipper and consignee [2, 10].

The Court also held that the prepayment of freight up to Davao City did not render the exculpatory clauses inoperative, as the contract provided no such exception [11]. Finally, the fact that United States Lines filed a claim with MPS on behalf of the consignee was not an admission of liability but proof of its diligence as an agent [12].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed.
