I. CAPTION
CITY OF MANILA v. GENARO N. TEOTICO and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-23052, January 29, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On January 27, 1958, respondent Genaro N. Teotico was waiting for a jeepney at the corner of Old Luneta and P. Burgos Avenue, Manila. When he stepped down from the curb to board a jeepney he had hailed, he fell into an uncovered and unlighted catchbasin (manhole). Teotico suffered injuries which prevented him from working for twenty days and caused him humiliation. He filed a complaint for damages against the City of Manila and various city officials. The City denied liability, citing theft of covers and regular inspections. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the dismissal as to the city officials but held the City of Manila liable for damages under Article 2189 of the Civil Code. The City appealed, arguing it is exempt from liability under its Charter (R.A. 409) and that P. Burgos Avenue is a national highway.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City of Manila is liable for damages under Article 2189 of the Civil Code despite the exemption clause in Section 4 of its Charter (R.A. 409).
2. W/N the City constitutes to be liable even if the street (P. Burgos Avenue) is a national highway.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that Article 2189 of the Civil Code governs the liability of the City. While Section 4 of R.A. 409 (Manila Charter) exempts the City from liability arising from the general negligence of its officers, Article 2189 constitutes a particular prescription specifically governing liability for death or injuries caused by the "defective condition of roads, streets, bridges, public buildings, and other public works." Consequently, regarding the specific subject matter of defective streets, the Civil Code provision prevails over the general exemption found in the Charter [1].

2. **YES.** The Court held that under Article 2189 of the Civil Code, it is not necessary for the defective road to *belong* to the province, city, or municipality for liability to attach. It is sufficient that the public work is under their "control or supervision" [2]. The City, in its answer, effectively admitted that the street was under its control and supervision by stating it had been "constantly kept in good condition" by the City [3]. Furthermore, the City Charter empowers the Municipal Board to regulate and improve streets [4].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed.
