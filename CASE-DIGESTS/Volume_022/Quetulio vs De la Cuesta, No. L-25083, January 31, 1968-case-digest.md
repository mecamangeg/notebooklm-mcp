**I. CAPTION**
JUSTINO QUETULIO, ET AL. v. NENA Q. DE LA CUESTA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25083, January 31, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
On June 4, 1964, petitioners Justino Quetulio et al. filed a complaint for recovery of real property against respondents Nena de la Cuesta et al., alleging that the respondents usurped their land in May 1948 [1]. Petitioners had previously filed Civil Case No. 705 regarding the same usurpation on May 19, 1948, but this case was dismissed without prejudice on June 25, 1955 [1].

Respondents moved to dismiss the 1964 complaint on the ground of prescription, arguing that the ten-year period under Act 190 was not interrupted by the filing of the first case [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription and denied petitioners' motion to amend the complaint (which sought to change the accrual date to 1946), citing *Amar v. Odiamon* [3]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the filing of the first action (Civil Case No. 705), which was dismissed without prejudice, interrupted the running of the prescriptive period under Act 190.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court ruled that the action has prescribed. Because the cause of action accrued in May 1948, prior to the effectivity of the New Civil Code, Article 1116 of the New Civil Code mandates that the laws previously in force govern [4, 5]. Thus, Section 40 of Act 190 (Code of Civil Procedure) applies, which provides a ten-year prescriptive period for actions to recover real property [5].

The Court applied the settled doctrine in *Amar v. Odiamon* that under Act 190, the filing of an action within the prescriptive period, if subsequently dismissed or desisted from, does not suspend the running of the statute of limitations [5]. Act 190 contains no express provision for the suspension of the prescriptive period by the institution of an action [5]. Since the period ran continuously from May 1948 to June 1964, the ten-year period had clearly elapsed [5]. Furthermore, even if the proposed amendment placing the accrual in 1946 were admitted, the cause would still have prescribed [6].

The appealed order of the lower court is affirmed [7].
