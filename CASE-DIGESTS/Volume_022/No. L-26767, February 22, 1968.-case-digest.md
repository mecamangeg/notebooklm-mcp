I. CAPTION
ANG TIONG v. LORENZO TING and FELIPE ANG, G.R. No. L-26767, February 22, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Lorenzo Ting issued a Philippine Bank of Communications check payable to "cash or bearer" for P4,000. Defendant-appellant Felipe Ang signed the back of the check (indorsement in blank). The check was received by plaintiff Ang Tiong, a holder for value, but was dishonored by the drawee bank upon presentment. Ang Tiong made written demands on both Ting and Ang, which were ignored. He filed a collection suit in the Municipal Court of Manila, which ruled in his favor. Felipe Ang appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, arguing he was merely an accommodation surety. The CFI affirmed his liability. Felipe Ang appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved purely questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the liability of an indorser of a bank check is governed by the Negotiable Instruments Law rather than the Civil Code provisions on suretyship.
2. W/N an accommodation indorser is liable to a holder for value even if the holder knew he was only an accommodation party.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The check is indisputably a negotiable instrument governed solely by the Negotiable Instruments Law (NIL), not Article 2071 of the Civil Code. Under Section 63 of the NIL, a person placing his signature upon an instrument otherwise than as maker, drawer, or acceptor is a general indorser, unless he clearly indicates an intention to be bound in some other capacity. Felipe Ang indorsed without qualification. Thus, under Section 66 of the NIL, he warranted the instrument's validity and engaged to pay the amount to the holder if the instrument was dishonored.

2. **YES.** Section 29 of the NIL expressly makes an accommodation party "liable on the instrument to a holder for value, notwithstanding that such holder at the time of taking the instrument knew him to be only an accommodation party." Felipe Ang's liability is primary and unconditional. The defense that he was a mere surety or accommodation party is not valid against a holder for value. His remedy to obtain security from the principal debtor concerns only himself and the accommodated party, and does not diminish the rights of the holder.

The judgment of the Court of First Instance is **AFFIRMED** in toto.
