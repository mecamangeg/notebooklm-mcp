I. CAPTION
**PALANAN LUMBER & PLYWOOD CO., INC., THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY, THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE & NATURAL RESOURCES, THE DIRECTOR OF FORESTRY, and THE DISTRICT FORESTER OF ISABELA v. HON. MANUEL ARRANZ, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Isabela, and PALANAN LOGGING ENTERPRISES, INC.**, G.R. No. L-27106, March 20, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., Actg. C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Palanan Lumber & Plywood Co., Inc. and private respondent Palanan Logging Enterprises, Inc. were competing applicants for a 50,000-hectare forest concession in Isabela. After conflicting awards by the Director of Forestry and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the Acting Executive Secretary, acting by authority of the President, issued a decision on November 12, 1964, dividing the concession equally between the two companies (25,000 hectares each).

Dissatisfied, Palanan Logging filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Isabela against Palanan Lumber and national officials, including the Executive Secretary, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Director of Forestry. The respondent Judge Arranz issued an *ex parte* writ of preliminary injunction restraining the petitioners from enforcing the Executive Secretary's decision. Petitioners filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied, and a motion for reconsideration, which remained unacted upon for over 110 days. Petitioners then filed the present action with the Supreme Court, arguing the lower court lacked jurisdiction over national officials holding office outside its territorial district.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance of Isabela has jurisdiction to issue a writ of preliminary injunction against national officials (Executive Secretary, et al.) who hold office in Manila and Quezon City.
2. W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the writ *ex parte*.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the respondent Judge acted without jurisdiction. Under Section 44 of the Judiciary Act (R.A. 296) and settled jurisprudence (*Castaño v. Lobingier*, *Samar Mining v. Arnado*), the power of Courts of First Instance to issue writs of injunction is limited to and operative only within their respective provinces and districts. Since the Executive Secretary, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Director of Forestry have their official residences in Manila and Quezon City—outside the territorial jurisdiction of the CFI of Isabela—the lower court could not validly issue the writ to restrain their acts. The Court distinguished this from *Gayacao v. Executive Secretary*, clarifying that while provincial courts may review the legal correctness of administrative decisions, they lack jurisdiction to issue prohibitory writs against officials stationed outside their territory, even if the subject land is within the province.

2. **YES.** Even assuming the lower court had jurisdiction, the issuance of the writ *ex parte* constituted grave abuse of discretion. Decisions regularly reached by competent executive officials carry a presumption of validity and regularity that cannot be brushed aside without a hearing. Furthermore, findings of fact by executive officials are generally not subject to judicial review absent arbitrariness. The petition in the lower court relied on mere conclusions without sufficient factual averments. The Court emphasized that preliminary injunctions are extraordinary remedies that should be dispensed with circumspection and only after hearing both sides whenever possible.

The petition is **GRANTED**. The respondent Court is prohibited from taking cognizance of the civil case, and the preliminary injunction issued by the Supreme Court is made permanent.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Fernando, J. (Concurring):**
Justice Fernando agreed with the ruling but added observations on jurisdiction. He noted that while no specific statute negates the power of CFIs to pass upon the validity of orders of the Executive Secretary, the hierarchy of administrative agencies suggests that a court of higher category should review Presidential decisions. He cited that CFIs lack jurisdiction over agencies like the Public Service Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, implying similar deference should apply to the Executive Secretary.
