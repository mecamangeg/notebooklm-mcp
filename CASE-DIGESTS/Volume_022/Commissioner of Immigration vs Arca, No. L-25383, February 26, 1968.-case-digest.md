**I. CAPTION**
COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION v. HON. FRANCISCO ARCA, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch I, SY KI B @ SY GIP, CO CHI and BABY CO, G.R. No. L-25383, February 26, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondents Sy Kib and her two minor children were admitted to the Philippines on July 30, 1960, as pre-arranged employees and dependents under Section 9(g) of the Immigration Act. Their authorized stay was limited to three years, which expired on July 29, 1963. The Commissioner of Immigration granted an extension until November 30, 1964, but the respondents remained in the country past this deadline. On March 12, 1965, the Acting Commissioner ordered them to depart. Sy Kib filed a petition for Prohibition with Preliminary Injunction before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, presided by respondent Judge Arca, seeking to enjoin their deportation until her husband is naturalized and her business interests are liquidated. Despite the Commissioner's opposition citing executive discretion, Judge Arca issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the arrest and deportation of the respondents.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance may enjoin the Commissioner of Immigration from arresting and deporting aliens whose authorized period of stay has expired.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the administration of immigration laws is the primary responsibility of the executive branch. The extension of an alien's stay is discretionary on the part of immigration authorities, and neither mandamus nor certiorari can compel the Commissioner to extend a stay that has already expired [1]. The Court held that if the Commissioner's actuations are unsatisfactory, the proper remedy is to appeal to the President of the Philippines, not the courts [1].

Furthermore, the Court rejected Sy Kib's argument regarding her husband's pending naturalization. Jurisprudence establishes that an alien wife and children whose stay has expired must leave the country, even if the husband has been granted naturalization but has not yet taken his oath [2, 3]. Regarding her business interests, the Court noted that Sy Kib knew the limited duration of her admission and assumed the risk of non-extension; moreover, her husband could manage the business in her absence [4].

The petition was granted. The preliminary injunction issued by the respondent court was dissolved, and the Commissioner of Immigration was ordered to proceed in accordance with law [5].
