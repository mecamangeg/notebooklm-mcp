I. CAPTION
LEONCIA CABRERA DE CHUATOCO v. GREGORIO ARAGON and JUDGE ESTEBAN GARCIA, G.R. No. L-20316, January 30, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner De Chuatoco was charged with slight slander in the Justice of the Peace Court of Antipolo (presided by respondent Judge Garcia) for allegedly uttering the remarks "Ikaw ay walang pinagaralan, leche ka" to respondent Aragon, a policeman. Petitioner filed a motion to quash the complaint, arguing that the facts charged did not constitute an offense. The judge denied the motion. Instead of entering a plea, petitioner filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed without prejudice. She then filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, alleging the judge acted with grave abuse of discretion. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that certiorari is not the proper remedy against an order denying a motion to quash. Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a special civil action for certiorari is the proper remedy against an order denying a motion to quash a criminal complaint.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the petition. The Court held that a writ of certiorari lies only when a tribunal acts without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion. In this case, the Justice of the Peace Court had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the person of the accused. The denial of a motion to quash is an interlocutory order that does not dispose of the case on its merits. Under the Rules of Court (citing Sec. 1, Rule 117), if a motion to quash is denied, the accused must immediately plead and proceed to trial. The proper remedy is to appeal the judgment of conviction in due time, not to file a petition for certiorari [1, 2]. The Court further ruled that determining whether the specific words uttered were slanderous constitutes a decision on the merits, which must be resolved during trial, not in a certiorari proceeding [3].

Petition is denied; Order affirmed.
