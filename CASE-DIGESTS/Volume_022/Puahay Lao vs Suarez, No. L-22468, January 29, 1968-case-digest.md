I. CAPTION
PUAHAY LAO v. DIMTOY SUAREZ and ALEJANDRO SUAREZ, G.R. No. L-22468, January 29, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Spouses Suarez leased a parcel of land in Jolo, Sulu to petitioner Puahay Lao. The lease contract provided for an "indefinite period," a monthly rental of P54.00 payable at the end of every month, and a stipulation that failure to pay on time would entitle the lessors to an additional 20% of the sum due as liquidated damages. Lao failed to pay rentals from July to October 1960. Consequently, respondents served notices of termination in November 1960. Lao tendered and subsequently consigned the overdue rentals in court but failed to include the stipulated 20% liquidated damages. Respondents filed a suit for ejectment and unpaid rentals in the Justice of the Peace Court. The lower court ruled in favor of respondents, a decision affirmed by the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeals, upholding the rescission of the lease due to breach of conditions.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lessors could validly terminate the lease and eject the tenant despite the consignation of overdue rentals.
2. W/N the indefinite period of the lease entitles the tenant to continued possession as long as he pays the rent.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The rentals were payable at the end of every month. When the petitioner failed to pay the rentals from July to October on time, the respondents became entitled to the stipulated 20% liquidated damages [1]. The petitioner's failure to consign these damages constituted a breach that entitled the lessors to rescind the contract and terminate the lease, both under the specific stipulations of the contract and **Article 1673 of the Civil Code**, which allows judicial ejectment for violation of any agreed condition [2]. The Court held that lessors are not required to bring a separate prior action for rescission; they may ask the court to do so and simultaneously seek ejection in a single action for illegal detainer (*Pamintuan v. Tiglao*) [2].

2. **NO.** Whether the lease is definite or indefinite, the lessor has the right to terminate the contract upon the violation of its terms and conditions [3]. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Singson v. Baldelomar*, rejecting the theory that a lease could continue for an indefinite term so long as the lessee paid rent. Such a scheme would leave the contract's validity and fulfillment solely to the free and uncontrolled choice of the tenant, violating the principle of mutuality of contracts under **Article 1308 of the Civil Code** (formerly Article 1256 of the Civil Code of 1889) [3].

The judgments appealed from are affirmed.
