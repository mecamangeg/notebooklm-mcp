I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. GREGORIO D. MONTEJO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga City, and LIM GO, G.R. No. L-23690, January 17, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On November 23, 1960, respondent Lim Go filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga City, which was granted on December 16, 1961 [1]. On February 22, 1964, Judge Montejo issued an order allowing Lim Go to take his oath of allegiance, which he did on the same day [2]. On March 12, 1964, the City Attorney filed a notice of appeal on behalf of the Republic and requested an extension to file the Record on Appeal [2]. The trial court granted three extensions covering a total of four months and ten days [3]. Despite a warning from the court that the appeal would be barred if not filed by July 18, 1964, the special counsel moved for a fourth extension on July 14 [4]. On July 22, 1964, Judge Montejo dismissed the appeal, ruling that the reasons for the delay were "flimsy" and that the State was deemed to have abandoned the appeal [5, 6]. The Republic filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the Republic's appeal for failure to file the Record on Appeal within the extended period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court exercised its discretion correctly [3]. Under Section 3, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, the 30-day period to file a record on appeal may be extended only upon justifiable reasons [6]. In this case, the petitioner was afforded ample time—over four months—to file a record on appeal that was not voluminous [3]. The Court found that the reasons invoked for the extensions, such as the need to "study, evaluate and assess evidence" or gather data from other agencies, were irrelevant to the mechanical task of compiling pleadings for a record on appeal [3]. These excuses demonstrated either culpable ignorance of the Rules or a desire to harass the respondent [3]. Accordingly, the petition was **dismissed** and the preliminary injunction dissolved [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Angeles, and Fernando concurred [8].
