I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SANTOS CABANERO y MARIVELES and CONSOLACION INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-22081, January 17, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Accused Santos Cabanero, charged with theft, was released on bail posted by appellant Consolacion Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. (Bondsman). When the case was called for trial on July 29, 1963, the accused failed to appear. The Court of First Instance of Manila ordered the bond confiscated and gave the Bondsman 30 days to produce the accused and explain his non-appearance. The Bondsman secured an extension and, on September 4, 1963, moved to lift the confiscation, explaining that it had exerted efforts to locate the accused and subsequently discovered he was confined in the Rizal Provincial Jail. The trial court denied the motion but, upon reconsideration, reduced the forfeiture to 20% of the bond amount. The Bondsman appealed, arguing that the judgment was premature and that the accused's government custody should result in total exoneration.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in rendering judgment on the bond before the expiration of the period granted to produce the accused.
2. W/N the bondsman is entitled to total exoneration because the accused was in government custody.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that if the bondsman produces the principal or submits an explanation for non-appearance before the 30-day period expires, the court need not wait for the period to lapse before rendering judgment. Once the explanation is submitted, the matter is ripe for resolution on whether the explanation is satisfactory and if the bondsman should be held liable. The Court cited *People v. Del Carmen*, noting there is no point in deferring judgment once the requisites are met or attempted [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The Bondsman is not entitled to total exoneration. Under Section 15 of Rule 114, the bondsman must satisfactorily explain why the accused did not appear *when first required*. As the "jailer of the principal," the bondsman is obligated to keep track of the accused's movements [3]. Here, the Bondsman was unaware of the accused's whereabouts on the trial date and only informed the court of his confinement more than 30 days later, indicating negligence [4]. While courts adopt a liberal attitude towards bondsmen, this liberality does not extend to totally exonerating a bondsman who fails to produce the accused when required, thereby causing delay in the trial (*People v. Familiar*) [5]. The reduction of liability to 20% is sufficient.

Order affirmed.
