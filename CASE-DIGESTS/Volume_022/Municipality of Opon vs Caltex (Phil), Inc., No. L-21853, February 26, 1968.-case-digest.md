**I. CAPTION**
MUNICIPALITY OF OPON (now LAPU-LAPU CITY), ET AL. v. CALTEX (PHILIPPINES) INC., G.R. No. L-21853, February 26, 1968, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Caltex (Philippines) Inc. is a domestic corporation engaged in the business of importing, distributing, and selling petroleum products. It operates the "Caltex Opon Terminal" in Opon, Cebu, which includes a tin can factory. While the factory primarily manufactures 5-gallon cans for Caltex's own use in distributing its products, Caltex also manufactured cans for Tidewater Associated Oil Company under a 1946 service agreement. From 1950 to 1955, the Municipality of Opon levied and collected P37,050.00 in license taxes on the factory based on Ordinance No. 9, which taxes tin factories based on maximum annual output.

In 1956, Caltex filed a suit to recover the taxes paid. The Court of First Instance of Cebu dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) modified the decision, ruling that Caltex could recover P27,900.00 representing taxes on cans used for its own business, but the P6,300.00 paid for cans made for Tidewater was validly collected. The CA also ruled that the claim for the 1950 tax (P2,850.00) had prescribed. The Municipality appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the entire output is taxable and that the refund claim is barred by the two-year prescriptive period under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC).

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N Caltex is liable for the municipal license tax on tin cans manufactured for its own use.
2. W/N the action to recover the municipal license taxes has prescribed under the two-year period in the NIRC.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** When a person or company is already taxed on its main business, it may not be further taxed for doing something or engaging in an activity which is merely a part of, incidental to, and necessary to its main business. The Court held that the manufacture of tin cans for Caltex's own petroleum products is incidental to its principal business of selling such products; the container is part of the product sold. Therefore, cans produced for its own use are not subject to the separate license tax under Ordinance No. 9. However, the Court affirmed that cans produced for a third party (Tidewater) are separately taxable. The Court relied on *Standard Vacuum Oil Company v. Antigua* and *City of Manila v. Fortune Enterprises, Inc.*

2. **NO.** The period for prescription of action to recover municipal license taxes is six years under Article 1145(2) of the Civil Code. The petitioners' reliance on Section 306 of the National Internal Revenue Code, which provides a two-year prescriptive period, is incorrect. That section applies exclusively to claims for refunds of "national internal revenue taxes" erroneously collected and does not apply to refunds of local or municipal license fees.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.
