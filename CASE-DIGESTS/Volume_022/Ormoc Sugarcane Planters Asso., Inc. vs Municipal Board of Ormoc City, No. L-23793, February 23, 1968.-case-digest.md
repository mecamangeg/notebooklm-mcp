I. CAPTION
ORMOC SUGARCANE PLANTERS ASSOCIATION, INC. v. THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF ORMOC CITY and HON. ESTEBAN C. CONEJOS, G.R. No. L-23793, February 23, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ormoc Sugarcane Planters Association, Inc. filed a petition for declaratory judgment against the Municipal Board of Ormoc City and the City Mayor to challenge the validity of Ordinance No. 4, Series of 1964. The ordinance imposed a 1% municipal tax on "any and all productions of centrifugal sugar milled at the Ormoc Sugar Company, Incorporated" for every export sale to the United States and other foreign countries. This case is a companion to *Ormoc Sugar Co., Inc. v. Treasurer of Ormoc City* (G.R. No. L-23794), where the Supreme Court previously ruled on the same ordinance. While the case was pending, Republic Act No. 4497 was enacted on June 19, 1965, amending the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. No. 2264).

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Ordinance No. 4, Series of 1964, imposing a tax on sugar exports, is constitutional and valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court declared the ordinance unconstitutional and void on two grounds.

First, citing the companion case *Ormoc Sugar Co., Inc. v. Treasurer of Ormoc City*, the Court held that the ordinance violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution [1-3]. The tax was not applied to a general class but specifically and exclusively referred to the "Ormoc Sugar Company, Incorporated" [3].

Second, the Court applied Section 2 of Republic Act No. 2264, as amended by Republic Act No. 4497. The amendment expressly prohibited chartered cities and municipalities from imposing taxes of any kind "which in effect impose a burden on exports of Philippine finished, manufactured or processed products" [4, 5]. This amendment effectively repealed the taxing power previously granted and nullified the subject ordinance [5, 6].

The ordinance is declared unconstitutional and void, and of no effect [5].
