I. CAPTION
ANTONIO JAO alias JAO TECK CHUAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-23116, January 24, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Antonio Jao, a Chinese citizen born in Manila in 1921, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu. He had resided in Manila and San Juan, Rizal for the greater part of his youth before moving to Cebu in 1956. To support his petition, he presented two character witnesses who testified that they first knew him in 1946 and met him only occasionally until he moved to Cebu. The notice of his petition was published in "La Prensa," a newspaper of general circulation in Cebu. The CFI granted the petition. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that the character witnesses were insufficient and that the publication was defective.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the character witnesses were sufficient to prove the petitioner's good moral character.
2. W/N the publication of the notice of petition in a Cebu newspaper was sufficient given the petitioner's prior residence in Manila and Rizal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that evidence of a petitioner's good moral character and conduct must embrace the entire period of his residence in the Philippines. The witnesses presented only knew the petitioner starting in 1946, when he was already 25 years old, and only met him occasionally until 1956. Consequently, they were not in a position to vouch for his irreproachable conduct for the entire period required by law, particularly during the time he resided in Manila and San Juan, Rizal. The Court cited *Lim v. Republic*, *Ng v. Republic*, and *King v. Republic* in applying this rule.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the publication was insufficient because there was no showing that "La Prensa" was of general circulation in Manila and San Juan, Rizal, where the petitioner spent the greater part of his youth. The purpose of the law in requiring publication is to apprise the general public of the application so that any person with derogatory information may bring it to the attention of the authorities. This purpose is defeated if publication is not made in the places where the applicant resided for a significant portion of his life.

**Decision appealed from is set aside and the petition is DISMISSED.**
