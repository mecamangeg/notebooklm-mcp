**I. CAPTION**
DOMINGO T. LAO v. HON. JOSE MOYA and LAO KANG SUY, G.R. No. L-24528, January 31, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Lao Kang Suy filed a suit against Petitioner Domingo Lao for the collection of a sum of money (approx. P419,000), resulting in the attachment of Petitioner's property, Hacienda Mapaya. On April 13, 1964, a pre-trial was held where the parties agreed—as reflected in the Pre-Trial Order—that Petitioner would sell the Hacienda within four months for at least P1,000,000 to settle his obligations [1, 2]. Petitioner subsequently requested an extension of this period [3].

Later, Petitioner challenged the validity of the Pre-Trial Order, alleging that it did not reflect the truth. He claimed that during the conference, he had disclosed to the Judge in strict confidence that he had already sold the Hacienda to the Land Authority in 1963 [4]. When the Petitioner failed to sell the property, the trial court authorized Respondent to sell it to another buyer and ordered Petitioner to execute the deed of sale [5, 6]. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari to set aside the trial court's orders.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the pre-trial order is valid and binding despite Petitioner's allegation that it failed to reflect the true proceedings.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the pre-trial order is valid and binding. The Court found that Petitioner implicitly acquiesced to the order by failing to complain about its terms immediately and by actively seeking an extension of the time to sell provided therein [7].

Furthermore, under **Section 4 of Rule 20** in relation to **Section 5(m) of Rule 131 of the Rules of Court**, a pre-trial order which recites the agreements made by the parties is presumed to be a regular and faithful discharge of the court's duty. This **presumption of veracity** cannot be rebutted by the Petitioner's bare allegations that he did not understand its import or that he made confidential disclosures contrary to the written order [8, 9].

The petition was **dismissed** and the preliminary injunction was revoked and set aside [10].
