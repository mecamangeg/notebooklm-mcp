I. CAPTION
NATIONAL WATERWORKS & SEWERAGE AUTHORITY v. HON. ANDRES REYES, Presiding Judge of Branch VI, CFI, Rizal; and C & C COMMERCIAL CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-28597, February 29, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner NAWASA published a call for bids for the supply of steel pipes for its waterworks project in Manila and suburbs. Respondent C & C Commercial Corporation (C & C) filed a complaint against NAWASA in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, presided by respondent Judge Reyes. C & C claimed that the exclusion of asbestos cement pressure pipes, which it manufactures, violated Republic Act No. 912 (which grants preference to local products). C & C sought to enjoin NAWASA from proceeding with the bidding.

NAWASA opposed, arguing that: (1) the CFI of Rizal lacked jurisdiction to enjoin acts committed in Manila (where NAWASA’s office and the bidding were located); (2) C & C failed to secure the required certification from the Director of Public Works under RA 912; and (3) C & C was disqualified from public bidding under Administrative Order No. 66 due to pending tax liabilities. Despite this, Judge Reyes issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the bidding. NAWASA filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CFI of Rizal has jurisdiction to issue a writ of preliminary injunction to be enforced in Manila.
2. W/N C & C Commercial Corporation is entitled to preference under Republic Act No. 912.
3. W/N C & C Commercial Corporation is disqualified from participating in the public bidding.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The power of a Court of First Instance to issue a writ of preliminary injunction is limited to its territorial boundaries. Citing *Cudiamat v. Torres* and Section 44(h) of the Judiciary Act, the Court held that a CFI cannot restrain acts outside its province or district. Since NAWASA’s office and the bidding were in Manila, the CFI of Rizal lacked jurisdiction to issue the writ, rendering it null and void [1, 2].

2. **NO.** Republic Act No. 912 grants preference to locally produced materials only upon certification of their "availability, practicability and usability" by the Director of Public Works. C & C failed to allege or produce such certification. Statutes granting special privileges are viewed with suspicion and strictly construed; rights thereunder exist only after strict compliance with conditions [3, 4].

3. **YES.** Administrative Order No. 66 disqualifies any person or entity with pending cases involving non-payment of taxes from participating in government biddings. C & C had tremendous tax liabilities and pending cases. The Court ruled that the constitutionality of the Executive Order could not be collaterally attacked and must be deemed valid [5, 6].

The petition is granted, and the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the respondent judge is set aside. Costs against private respondent C & C Commercial Corporation.
