I. CAPTION
ESTRELLA DE LA CRUZ v. SEVERINO DE LA CRUZ, G.R. No. L-19565, January 30, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Estrella and Severino de la Cruz were married in 1938 and acquired significant property, including land and businesses. In 1955, Severino began living in his office in Bacolod and later in Manila to manage their expanding businesses, ceasing to sleep at the conjugal abode [1, 2]. Estrella filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental for separation of property, monthly support, and attorney's fees, alleging that Severino had abandoned her to live with a concubine and was mismanaging their conjugal partnership properties [3]. Severino denied abandonment, stating he lived separately to avoid Estrella's jealousy and quarreling, and to focus on business [4]. He proved he continued to provide financial support to the family and increased the value of their assets [5, 6]. The CFI ordered the separation of conjugal assets and awarded attorney's fees [7]. Severino appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the husband’s physical separation from his wife constitutes abandonment justifying a separation of property.
2. W/N the husband’s failure to inform his wife of the state of their business constitutes abuse of administration warranting a division of assets.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Article 178 of the New Civil Code, abandonment requires more than just physical estrangement; it must constitute "real abandonment," meaning the absolute cessation of marital relations, duties, and rights, with the intention of perpetual separation [8, 9]. The Court found that Severino did not intend to leave his family permanently as he continued to provide support and manage the conjugal properties with zeal [10, 11]. Physical separation alone, without financial and moral desertion, does not justify the separation of property [12].

2. **NO.** Article 167 of the New Civil Code allows separation of property in case of "abuse of powers of administration." The Court held that mere refusal or failure to inform the wife of business progress does not constitute abuse [13]. Abuse implies a willful and utter disregard of the partnership's interest, evidenced by deliberate acts prejudicial to it [13]. The evidence showed Severino actually expanded the conjugal assets significantly through his industry, negating any claim of mismanagement or dissipation [14].

**ACCORDINGLY**, the judgment granting separation of property is **REVERSED** and **SET ASIDE**. The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff P3,000 monthly support and reduced attorney's fees of P10,000 [15].
