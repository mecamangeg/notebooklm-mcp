I. CAPTION
JULIAN ABANA (Deceased), Substituted by Arcadia Vda. de Abana, et al. v. FRANCISCO QUISUMBING, G.R. No. L-23489, March 27, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Julian Abana was employed as a taxi driver for respondent Francisco Quisumbing (Dollar Taxi) since 1952 [1]. In August 1958, Abana suffered a heart attack after work and was diagnosed with "congestive heart failure, hypertensive" [2]. Upon improving, he returned to work but suffered another attack while driving in 1959 [3]. His condition recurred frequently, preventing him from working, yet he always reported these instances to management requesting leave, receiving only small *vales* instead of benefits [3]. By January 1961, he was permanently incapacitated [4].

The Hearing Officer ruled the illness compensable and ordered the payment of benefits [4]. However, the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed this ruling, dismissing the claim on the ground that the causal connection between the work and the illness was not sufficiently established [5]. Abana (substituted by his heirs upon death) petitioned the Supreme Court for review [1, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner's heart ailment is compensable under the Workmen's Compensation Act.
2. W/N the claim is barred by the failure to file a formal notice of sickness within the prescribed period.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that driving a taxicab for long hours in Manila causes severe strain and tension that aggravates a heart condition [5]. Furthermore, under Section 44 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, there is a legal presumption that an illness which supervenes during employment either arose out of or was aggravated by said employment [7]. This presumption shifts the burden of proof to the employer to show lack of causation, which the respondent failed to do [7, 8]. The mere opinion of doctors cannot prevail over this statutory presumption [8].

2. **NO.** The defense of prescription is untenable because the respondent had actual knowledge of the claimant's illness [8]. It was undisputed that Abana reported the matter to management every time his heart disease recurred [8]. Under the law, formal notice of injury or sickness is superfluous when the employer already has actual knowledge of the ailment [8]. The Workmen's Compensation Act, being social legislation, must be liberally construed to attain its purpose [8].

The judgment of the WCC is reversed, and the decision of the Hearing Officer awarding benefits to the heirs of the petitioner is reinstated [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, and Fernando concurred with the decision [9].
