**I. CAPTION**
**PACIFIC OXYGEN & ACETYLENE COMPANY v. CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-21881, March 1, 1968, Fernando, J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiff Pacific Oxygen & Acetylene Co. applied for a letter of credit through the Philippine Trust Company (an agent of the Central Bank) to cover the importation of a plant from the United States. To cover the dollar commitment, the Philippine Trust Company applied for the purchase of forward exchange with the Central Bank on January 17, 1962. On January 18, 1962, the Central Bank executed the corresponding forward exchange contract for the sale of foreign exchange.

On January 21, 1962, the Central Bank suspended the margin levy. The foreign correspondent bank subsequently honored the drafts in February 1962. Plaintiff paid the 15% margin fee amounting to P30,839.49 under protest and filed a suit for refund. The lower court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, citing *Belman Cia., Inc. v. Central Bank*, holding that the fee should not apply because the drafts were honored after the levy was suspended. The Central Bank appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the margin fee was validly collected on a forward exchange contract executed before the suspension of the margin levy.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court held that the margin fee was correctly imposed. Under Republic Act No. 2609, the fee applies to "all sales of foreign exchange" by the Central Bank [1]. Applying the Civil Code, a contract of sale is perfected at the moment there is a meeting of minds upon the thing and the price (Arts. 1458, 1475) [2].

Here, the purchase of the forward exchange occurred on January 17, 1962 (perfected on January 18), which was prior to the suspension of the margin levy on January 21, 1962 [3]. The fact that the drafts were honored by the foreign bank only in February is not controlling [4]. The Court ruled that the *Belman* dictum relied upon by the lower court is not authoritative in this case given the clear terms of the law. The first duty of the court is to apply the law according to its express terms [5].

Judgment reversed.
