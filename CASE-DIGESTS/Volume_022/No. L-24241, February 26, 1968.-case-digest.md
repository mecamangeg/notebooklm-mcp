I. CAPTION
HATIB ABRAIN v. TONGHAM CHUA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-24241, February 26, 1968, 22 SCRA 749, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On March 12, 1958, respondent Tongham Chua filed a suit for "forcible entry and illegal detainer" against petitioner Hatib Abrain in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Bongao, Sulu [1]. Chua alleged that he owned the land and that Abrain had been his tenant on a 50-50 sharing basis, but Abrain unlawfully occupied the land and refused to give the landlord's share [1]. On February 27, 1959, the JP Court rendered judgment ordering Abrain to vacate, finding that a tenancy relationship existed but Abrain had stopped paying his share due to a desire to assume ownership [2].

Abrain filed a petition for relief from judgment or annulment in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Sulu, arguing that the JP Court lacked jurisdiction as the case fell under the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) [3]. The CFI dismissed the petition on October 30, 1964, ruling that there was no fraud or excusable negligence to justify relief and that the case was one of ejectment [4]. Abrain appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Justice of the Peace Court had jurisdiction over the case.
2. W/N the remedy of a petition for relief was barred by the lapse of time under Rule 38.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Justice of the Peace Court had no jurisdiction. The complaint explicitly averred a tenancy relationship and sought dispossession of the tenant for non-compliance with the sharing agreement [5]. Under Section 21 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act (R.A. 1199) and Section 7 of R.A. 1267, all cases involving the dispossession of a tenant by the landholder fall within the **exclusive original jurisdiction** of the Court of Agrarian Relations [6-8]. This exclusive jurisdiction is not divested even if the tenant asserts ownership over the land [9].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the limitations of Rule 38 regarding petitions for relief are inapplicable because the judgment of the JP Court was **void *ab initio*** for lack of jurisdiction [10]. A void judgment is a "lawless thing" that affects no rights and may be attacked directly or collaterally at any time, even when no appeal has been taken [10, 11].

The Order of the CFI is **REVERSED** and the decision of the Justice of the Peace Court is **ANNULLED** [10].
