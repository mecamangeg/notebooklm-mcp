I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. TEOTIMO ALEGARME, G.R. No. L-20722, February 20, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On January 19, 1961, Basilio Alegarme was shot and killed while walking home in Dumalinao, Zamboanga del Sur [1]. His brothers, Teotimo and Adolfo Alegarme, were charged with murder [1]. The prosecution relied on the testimony of Estelita Canencia, an alleged eyewitness, and an extrajudicial confession (Exhibit D) signed by Teotimo [2]. Teotimo repudiated the confession, claiming it was secured through duress and maltreatment by the Chief of Police, and presented an alibi [3].

The Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Sur found Canencia's testimony unworthy of credence due to bias and inconsistency but convicted Teotimo based on the confession and circumstantial evidence, specifically a land conflict between the brothers [4, 5]. Adolfo was acquitted [6]. Teotimo appealed the conviction [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the guilt of the accused Teotimo Alegarme was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the decision and acquitted Teotimo Alegarme [7].

The Court ruled that the circumstances surrounding the case precluded a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt [7]. The trial court itself rejected the eyewitness testimony [4]. Regarding the confession, the Court found the police chief's testimony doubtful; it was unnatural for him to ask Teotimo point-blank why he killed his brother without prior evidence, suggesting prejudgment [8, 9]. Furthermore, the alleged motive regarding a land conflict was invalid because the litigation had already been decided in favor of the accused prior to the crime [9].

The Court emphasized that while individual circumstances might appear consistent with guilt when viewed singly, the accused's conduct—going to the crime scene crying, inquiring about the killer's identity, and voluntarily accompanying the police—strongly suggested innocence when considered collectively [8]. Even the Solicitor General recommended acquittal, admitting the evidence failed to produce moral certainty [7].
