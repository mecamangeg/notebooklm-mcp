I. CAPTION
MARTINIANO P. VIVO, in his capacity as (Acting) COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION v. HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL and TIU SIOK TIN, G.R. No. L-24946, January 18, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Private respondents Tiu Siok Tin and her two minor children arrived in the Philippines in 1960 as temporary visitors. Their stay was extended repeatedly, with the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and Justice endorsing an extension up to October 14, 1963, pending the naturalization of the husband/father, Lim Siong. However, the Commissioner of Immigration granted a final extension only until September 12, 1962. When the Commissioner ordered them to leave by that date, respondents filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance of Manila. Respondent Judge Cloribel issued the injunction. The Commissioner subsequently moved to dissolve the injunction, citing *Vivo v. Arca*, arguing that the refusal to dissolve the writ after the expiration of the aliens' authorized stay constitutes grave abuse of discretion. Respondents opposed, noting that Lim Siong had taken his oath as a Filipino in 1964. Judge Cloribel denied the Commissioner's motion to dismiss/dissolve, prompting this petition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to dissolve the preliminary injunction after the expiration of the aliens' authorized stay.
2. W/N the naturalization of the husband automatically makes the alien wife a Filipino citizen.
3. W/N appeal is the adequate remedy for the petitioner.

IV. RULING
**1. YES.** The respondent Judge plainly ignored the Court's ruling in *Vivo v. Arca* and sanctioned the open and continuing violation of immigration laws. The Court held that the refusal of the lower court to dissolve the preliminary injunction even after the terminus of the respondents' longest authorized stay (October 14, 1963) was against the law and constitutes grave abuse of discretion. The prohibition case before the trial court had become moot upon the expiration of the authorized stay, leaving the court with no jurisdiction except to dismiss the case.

**2. NO.** The naturalization of the respondent wife's husband, even if conceded, would not automatically make her a Filipino who cannot be deported. She retains her status as an alien until she meets the legal requirements for citizenship herself. Furthermore, the alien children could no longer be said to have "lawful residence" after their stay expired.

**3. NO.** Appeal is not an adequate remedy because, pending appeal, the aliens would be able to unduly prolong their illegal stay in violation of the country's immigration laws and policies. Additionally, a motion for reconsideration was unnecessary as it would only involve more delay prejudicial to government interests.

Petition **GRANTED**. The assailed orders are **ANNULLED and SET ASIDE**, and Respondent Judge Cloribel is permanently **RESTRAINED** from further taking cognizance of Civil Case No. 51574, except to dismiss it.
