I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. VICTORIAS MILLING CO., INC. and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-24108, January 3, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Victorias Milling Co., Inc. claimed a refund of P2,817.08, representing 50% of the specific tax paid on manufactured oils and fuels used in its agricultural operations from June 18, 1952 to December 31, 1955, pursuant to Section 142 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) [1, 2]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) denied the claim for this period, ruling it was filed beyond the two-year prescriptive period under Section 306 of the Tax Code [2]. Victorias Milling appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), arguing that Section 306 applies only to taxes erroneously or illegally collected, not to taxes legally collected that became refundable due to a supervening cause [3, 4]. The CTA ruled in favor of Victorias Milling, ordering the refund [3]. The CIR appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the claim for refund of specific taxes has prescribed under Section 306 of the National Internal Revenue Code.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CTA decision, ruling that the claim had prescribed. The Court held that Sections 306 and 309 of the NIRC govern all internal revenue tax refunds, regardless of the conditions of payment [5]. While the tax was legally collected, the two-year prescriptive period commences from the "supervening cause" that gave rise to the right of refund (in this case, the use of oils in agriculture) rather than the date of payment [6, 7].

However, the law requires that the suit or proceeding in the Court of Tax Appeals be commenced within the two-year period [8]. Although Victorias Milling filed its administrative claim with the BIR in December 1957 (within two years of December 1955), it did not file its appeal with the CTA until February 14, 1962—more than six years after the supervening cause [7, 8]. Citing *Gibbs v. Collector*, the Court reiterated that if the Collector takes time to decide, the taxpayer must file suit before the two-year period expires [8]. Consequently, the right to claim the refund was barred by prescription.

**Decision reversed.**
