I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ELMER ESTRADA, G.R. No. L-26103, January 17, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On November 27, 1963, at around 11:00 P.M. in Cebu City, Alexander "Sonny" Almendras was shot and killed outside the Insular Cafe. Prior to this, bad blood existed between the victim and the accused, Elmer "Baby" Estrada, stemming from an incident where Almendras had stabbed Estrada. On the night of the crime, witnesses saw Estrada, Alberto Tejero, and a certain "Fred" standing in front of Almendras. Almendras was heard saying, "Let us talk this over, Bert," immediately followed by gunfire. The assailants fled in a waiting taxi. Witness Jorge Cordero immediately identified Estrada to the police as one of the assailants. Estrada interposed the defense of alibi, claiming he was at home sleeping. The Court of First Instance of Cebu convicted Estrada of murder qualified by evident premeditation and sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty of 12 years and 1 day to 20 years. Estrada appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court because the penalty imposable was *reclusion perpetua*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N conspiracy existed between the accused and his companions.
2. W/N the defense of alibi can prosper against positive identification.
3. W/N the prosecution may present witnesses not listed in the information.
4. W/N the indeterminate penalty imposed by the trial court was correct.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that conspiracy was established. Although there was no direct proof of a previous agreement, conspiracy may be inferred from the acts of the accused which point to a joint purpose and design. The accused and his companions arrived together, confronted the victim simultaneously, and fled in the same vehicle. The Court held that "to establish conspiracy, it is not necessary to prove previous agreement to commit a crime if there is proof that the malefactors have acted in consort and in pursuance of the same objective" [1].

2. **NO.** The Court reiterated that alibi is the weakest of all defenses and should be rejected when the identity of the accused has been sufficiently and positively established by eyewitnesses [2]. Furthermore, for alibi to prosper, the accused must demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene. Estrada's house was near the crime scene, and the timeline of the police arrival at his home contradicted his claim of having been there long before the shooting [3].

3. **YES.** The right of the prosecution to call witnesses other than those listed in the complaint or information cannot be questioned [4]. While the accused is entitled to know the nature and cause of the accusation, he is not entitled to know in advance the names of all prosecution witnesses, as this could lead to coercion or suppression of testimony [5].

4. **NO.** The trial court erred in applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law. The crime committed was Murder qualified by evident premeditation. With no other mitigating or aggravating circumstances (nighttime and superior strength were not appreciated), the penalty under Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code is *reclusion perpetua* (the medium period). The Indeterminate Sentence Law does not apply to persons convicted of offenses punished with death or life imprisonment [6].

**Disposition:** Judgment modified; accused sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* and ordered to indemnify the heirs.
