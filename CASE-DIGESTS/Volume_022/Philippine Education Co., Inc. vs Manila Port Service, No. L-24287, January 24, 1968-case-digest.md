I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE EDUCATION COMPANY, INC. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-24287, January 24, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Philippine Education Company, Inc. was the consignee of a shipment of books and magazines arriving from New York on the M/S "EFFIE MAERSK." The vessel arrived in Manila on June 29, 1960. On the same day, the consignee filed a provisional claim for "shortage and/or damage" with the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service. The last package of the cargo was discharged on June 30, 1960. A formal claim was subsequently filed on October 25, 1960, followed by an amended claim for P1,431.64. Manila Port Service rejected the claim, arguing it was not filed within the 15-day period from the last discharge of cargo as required by Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract. The City Court and the Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the consignee. Manila Port Service appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a provisional claim filed on the day of the vessel's arrival, prior to the discharge of the cargo, constitutes substantial compliance with the 15-day filing requirement of the Management Contract.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the provisional claim was "evidently premature and speculative" and did not substantially comply with Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract. The claim was filed on the same day the vessel arrived, before the cargo had been discharged, and there was no evidence that the consignee had actually discovered or been reliably informed of any shortage or damage at that time [1-3]. The Court noted the claim was merely speculating on a possibility, evidenced by its broad description as "shortlanded and/or landed in bad order" [3]. Citing *Shell Co. vs. Compañia General de Tabacos* and *Rizal Surety & Ins. Co. vs. Manila Railroad Co.*, the Court reiterated that damage claims made prior to the discharge of the last package are insufficient [4]. Since the formal claim was filed well beyond the 15-day period from the last discharge (June 30, 1960), the claim is barred [4, 5].

The appealed decision is **REVERSED**, and the complaint is ordered **DISMISSED**.
