I. CAPTION
DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AMERICAN PIONEER LINE, ET AL. and REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-28651, February 27, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On March 18, 1963, eight cases of truck replacement parts consigned to Silvertown Auto Supply arrived on the "SS Pioneer Ming" and were discharged into the custody of the Customs Arrastre Service of the Republic of the Philippines. Upon delivery to the broker, one case was found empty. Plaintiff Domestic Insurance Company, as insurer, paid the consignee P3,210.09 and was subrogated to its rights [1]. The plaintiff sued the Republic to recover the amount. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the plaintiff, ordering the Republic to pay the claim plus attorney's fees [1]. The Republic appealed, raising the defense of non-suability [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Republic of the Philippines may be sued without its consent for the operation of the arrastre service through the Bureau of Customs.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Bureau of Customs is part of the Department of Finance and has no personality of its own apart from the National Government. Its primary function is governmental (assessing and collecting revenues), and the arrastre service is a necessary incident to this function [3, 4]. The Court applied the doctrine in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service*, holding that even if a non-corporate government entity performs a proprietary function, there is no waiver of sovereign immunity if such function is incidental to its governmental function [4-6]. Statutory waivers of immunity are strictly construed [3]. The plaintiff's proper remedy is to file a money claim with the Auditor General under Act 3083 and Commonwealth Act 327 [7, 8].

ACCORDINGLY, the judgment *a quo* is set aside, and the case is dismissed [9].
