I. CAPTION
THE PHILIPPINE AMERICAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY v. THE AUDITOR GENERAL, G.R. No. L-19255, January 18, 1968, 22 SCRA 135, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On January 1, 1950, petitioner Philippine American Life Insurance Company (Philamlife) entered into a Reinsurance Treaty with American International Reinsurance Company (Airco). Under the treaty, Philamlife agreed to reinsure the excess of its life insurance policies with Airco. On July 16, 1959, the Margin Law (R.A. 2609) took effect, imposing a margin fee on sales of foreign exchange by the Central Bank but exempting "contractual obligations calling for payment of foreign exchange issued, approved and outstanding" as of the law's effectivity date.

Philamlife remitted reinsurance premiums to Airco totaling $610,998.63 after the Margin Law took effect. The Central Bank collected P268,747.48 in margin fees on these remittances. Philamlife filed a claim for refund, arguing that the premiums were paid pursuant to the 1950 Reinsurance Treaty and were thus pre-existing obligations exempt under Section 3 of R.A. 2609. The Central Bank Auditor refused the claim, and the Auditor General denied the request for reconsideration. Philamlife petitioned the Supreme Court for review.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the reinsurance premiums remitted are exempt from the margin fee under Section 3 of the Margin Law (R.A. 2609).
2. W/N the application of the Margin Law impairs the obligation of the Reinsurance Treaty.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the existence of the Reinsurance Treaty of 1950 did not place the reinsurance premiums out of the reach of the Margin Law. A distinction must be made between a "reinsurance treaty" (a contract *for* insurance) and a "reinsurance policy" or cession (a contract *of* insurance). The treaty merely established an agreement to cede future risks; it did not create a fixed financial obligation. The obligation to remit premiums becomes fixed and definite only upon the execution of the reinsurance *cession*. Since the remittances were made for cessions effected after the Margin Law took effect, they were not obligations "outstanding" as of the date of the Act.

2. **NO.** The constitutional guaranty of non-impairment of contracts is limited by the police power of the State. The Margin Law is a remedial currency measure enacted to protect the international reserves of the country. Furthermore, existing laws form part of the contract. When Philamlife entered the treaty in 1950, the Central Bank Act (R.A. 265, enacted in 1948) was already in force, allowing the State to impose restrictions on foreign exchange during crises. The Margin Law is a reasonable supplement to the Central Bank Act. Thus, the State's economic policy to preserve monetary stability prevails over private contractual rights.

The petition for review is denied.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Fernando, J., concurring:**
Agreed with the result but emphasized that the police power does not automatically override the non-impairment clause. Instead, a process of "balancing, adjustment, or harmonization" is required to reconcile state regulatory power with property rights. In this case, the emergency nature of the economic situation justified the regulation.
