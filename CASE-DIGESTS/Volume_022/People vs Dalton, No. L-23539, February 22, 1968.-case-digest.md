I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PEDRO DALTON, G.R. No. L-23539, February 22, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
The accused, Pedro Dalton, was charged with the crime of grave coercion under Article 286 of the Revised Penal Code in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo [1]. The penalty for grave coercion is *arresto mayor* and a fine not exceeding P500.00 [1]. The CFI dismissed the information for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that under Section 87 of the Judiciary Act as amended by R.A. 3828, the Municipal Court of Estancia had original jurisdiction over the offense [1, 2]. The Fiscal appealed the order of dismissal to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the crime of grave coercion.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the CFI has concurrent jurisdiction with the Municipal Court. While R.A. 3828 enlarged the jurisdiction of Municipal Courts to cover offenses punishable by imprisonment of up to 3 years or a fine not exceeding P3,000.00, Section 44 of the Judiciary Act—which vests CFIs with jurisdiction over offenses punishable by imprisonment exceeding 6 months or a fine exceeding P200.00—remained unaltered [2].

This resulted in **concurrent jurisdiction** between the two courts over crimes punishable by imprisonment exceeding 6 months but not beyond 3 years, and fines exceeding P200.00 but not more than P3,000.00 [2, 3]. Since the penalty for grave coercion falls within this range, the CFI had authority to try the case once the information was filed there [2].

The appealed orders were **ANNULLED and SET ASIDE**, and the case was remanded to the Court of First Instance for trial on the merits [4].
