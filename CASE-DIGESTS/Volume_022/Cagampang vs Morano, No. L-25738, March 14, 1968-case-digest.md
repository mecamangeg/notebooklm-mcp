I. CAPTION
SILVERIO CAGAMPANG v. FLAVIANO MORANO, G.R. No. L-25738, March 14, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Silverio Cagampang filed a forcible entry and detainer suit against Defendant Flaviano Morano regarding a parcel of land abutting the sea in Bacuag, Surigao del Norte. Cagampang claimed possession for over 80 years, while Morano asserted occupancy based on a 1959 foreshore grant and revocable permit. During pre-trial in the Court of First Instance, the parties agreed to an ocular inspection: if the "highest ordinary tide" reached the lot, Cagampang would concede the land to Morano. The inspection revealed that the lot is covered by the highest tides during May, June, and July. The trial court ruled in favor of Morano, declaring the lot public land. Cagampang appealed, arguing the court disregarded the pre-trial agreement by considering Morano's permit rather than limiting the determination to the tide coverage.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the subject land is part of the public domain (foreshore land).

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. The ocular inspection established that the land is covered by sea water at high tide during the months of May, June, and July [1, 2]. Under Article 1, paragraph 3 of the Spanish Law of Waters of 1866, the shore is defined as the space covered and uncovered by the movement of the tide, with the interior limit being the line reached by the highest equinoctial tides [3]. Furthermore, Article 420 of the Civil Code declares shores as property of the public domain [3]. Since the tides covering the land were not proven to be abnormal, the land is part of the shore and thus public property [4]. Consequently, legal possession belongs to the State or its grantee, Morano, giving him a superior right to possession over Cagampang who possessed no State grant [4]. Judgment affirmed.
