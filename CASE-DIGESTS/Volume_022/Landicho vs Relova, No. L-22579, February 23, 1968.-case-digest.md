I. CAPTION
ROLANDO LANDICHO v. HON. LORENZO RELOVA and PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22579, February 23, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On February 27, 1963, petitioner Rolando Landicho was charged with bigamy by his first wife, Elvira Makatangay, for contracting a second marriage with Fe Pasia [1, 2]. Subsequently, on March 15, 1963, the second wife filed a civil action to annul her marriage to Landicho on the grounds of force, threats, and intimidation [1, 2]. On June 15, 1963, Landicho filed a third-party complaint in the civil case against his first wife, seeking to annul their marriage on the same grounds of force and intimidation [1, 2].

Landicho moved to suspend the criminal bigamy proceedings, arguing that the validity of the two marriages in the pending civil suit constituted a prejudicial question [1, 3]. The respondent Judge denied the motion, ruling it lacked merit [3]. Landicho filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition to challenge this denial [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the pending civil action for annulment of the first and second marriages constitutes a prejudicial question that warrants the suspension of the criminal case for bigamy.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the mere existence of actions to annul marriages entered into by an accused in a bigamy case does not automatically raise a prejudicial question to warrant suspending the criminal case [1, 5].

The Court applied the principle that parties to a marriage are not permitted to judge its nullity for themselves; such validity must be submitted to the judgment of competent courts [5, 6]. Until a marriage is judicially declared void, the presumption is that it exists [5, 6]. Consequently, a person who contracts a second marriage before a judicial declaration of nullity of the first marriage assumes the risk of being prosecuted for bigamy [6, 7].

The Court distinguished this case from *Zapanta v. Mendoza*, noting that in the present case, the fact that two marriage ceremonies occurred was indisputable at the time of the indictment [7]. Furthermore, the third-party complaint challenging the validity of the first marriage was filed months after the criminal prosecution began, suggesting it was not a logical antecedent necessarily determinative of the criminal liability [7, 8].

The petition was **denied** [9].
