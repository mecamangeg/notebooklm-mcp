I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SIMPLICIANO SORIA, G.R. No. L-25175, March 1, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Simpliciano Soria was charged with violating Section 39 of R.A. 1199 (prohibition against pre-threshing) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Nueva Ecija upon complaint of landowner Lourdes C. Paez [1]. Soria filed a motion to quash, arguing that he had elected the leasehold system under the Land Reform Code and thus was not criminally liable [2].

Judge Placido C. Ramos issued an order granting the motion to quash and dismissing the case. The order was dated October 1, 1965, but was received by the Clerk of Court and filed only on October 19, 1965 [3], [4]. However, prior to the filing, Judge Ramos had been appointed to the CFI of Manila on October 11, 1965, and had qualified for the position on October 12, 1965 [4]. Paez intervened and appealed, arguing the order was invalid because Judge Ramos was no longer the judge of the CFI of Nueva Ecija at the time of promulgation [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the order of dismissal is valid despite being promulgated after the Judge had qualified for a position in another court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court declared the promulgation of the dismissal order invalid. The Court ruled that it is not the date of writing the decision that constitutes rendition and gives it validity, but the filing of such decision with the Clerk of Court [6]. Since the order was filed on October 19, 1965, after Judge Ramos had already qualified for the CFI of Manila on October 12, 1965, he had already ceased to be the Judge of the CFI of Nueva Ecija [4], [6].

The Court further held that Section 9 of Rule 135, which permits signing judgments outside the province, applies only when a judge leaves via temporary transfer or assignment (detail) [7], [8]. It does not apply to a permanent transfer resulting from a new appointment [8]. Consequently, the order was set aside and the case was remanded to the lower court for resolution anew [9].
