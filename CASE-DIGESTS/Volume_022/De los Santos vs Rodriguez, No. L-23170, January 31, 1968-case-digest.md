I. CAPTION
ALBINA DE LOS SANTOS v. ALEJANDRO RODRIGUEZ, COMMISSIONER OF FISHERIES, and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-23170, January 31, 1968, 22 SCRA 451, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Albina de los Santos held a homestead patent for Lot 879 in Davao. In 1948, she petitioned the Bureau of Lands to amend her patent to include the adjacent Lot 880. Respondent Alejandro Rodriguez, holding a Fishpond Permit issued by the Bureau of Fisheries, occupied Lots 880 and 1350. Santos protested to the Bureau of Fisheries, claiming Lot 880 was part of her homestead, but the Director overruled her protest in 1950.

Pending a motion for reconsideration with the Bureau, Santos filed a civil case for possession against Rodriguez. The Court of Appeals (CA) eventually ruled in her favor in 1958 (CA-G.R. No. 18912-R), ordering Rodriguez to surrender possession of part of Lot 880. This judgment became final after the Supreme Court dismissed Rodriguez's petition for review. However, on February 24, 1959, the Director of Fisheries finally resolved Santos' motion for reconsideration, denying it and ruling that Lot 880 was covered by Rodriguez’s fishpond permit, not Santos’ homestead.

When Santos sought a writ of execution for the 1958 civil judgment, the trial court granted it despite the new administrative ruling. Rodriguez filed a petition for prohibition (treated as certiorari) with the CA (CA-G.R. No. 32970-R). The CA granted the petition and annulled the writ of execution regarding Lot 880. Santos appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the CA's jurisdiction to issue the writ when no appeal was pending.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari or prohibition regarding an order of execution issued by a trial court after the judgment has become final.
2. W/N the trial court may refuse to issue a writ of execution for a final and executory judgment due to facts transpiring after the judgment.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, prohibition, or certiorari in connection with orders issued by a trial court incidental to the execution of a final decision. It is not necessary that the party initiating the case actually appealed or is about to appeal; it is sufficient that if they wished to appeal the order, it would fall within the appellate court's jurisdiction [1]. A final judgment in the lower court does not negate the CA's jurisdiction to issue writs to prevent improper or erroneous execution orders [2].

2. **YES.** While a court generally cannot refuse to issue a writ of execution upon a final judgment, an exception exists when "facts and circumstances transpire which render its execution impossible or unjust" [3]. The Court cited *Molina v. De La Riva* and *Amor v. Judge Jose*, establishing that execution may be stayed or modified if there has been a change in the situation of the parties making execution inequitable [4].

In this case, the 1958 judicial decision awarding possession to Santos was based on her priority of holding the land *pending* the determination of the administrative question regarding the homestead's extent. The subsequent 1959 order by the Director of Fisheries—who has direct executive control over the disposition of public lands—conclusively determined that Lot 880 was part of Rodriguez's fishpond permit, not Santos' homestead [5, 6]. This administrative ruling constituted a material change in the situation of the parties, reversing their legal positions. Thus, enforcing the prior judgment for possession would be unjust as Santos had ceased to be entitled to the relief [7, 8].

**Petition denied. Decision affirmed.**
