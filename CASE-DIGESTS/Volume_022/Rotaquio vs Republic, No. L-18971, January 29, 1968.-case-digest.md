I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE CHANGE OF NAME OF ABUNDIO ROTAQUIO. ABUNDIO ROTAQUIO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18971, January 29, 1968, Dizon, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner-Appellee Abundio Rotaquio filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of Davao (Special Proceedings No. 1100) to change his surname from "Rotaquio" to "Rota" [2]. He contended that his surname causes confusion because people often mistake it for his Christian name [3]. The lower court granted the petition. The Republic of the Philippines appealed the order, arguing that the State has an interest in the names borne by individuals for identification purposes and that a change of name is a mere privilege, not a right [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the confusion caused by the petitioner's surname constitutes a sufficient reason to authorize a change of name.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that while the State has an interest in the names used by individuals for identification and a change of name is a privilege rather than a right, courts may grant such authority if there is "sufficient reason," such as when the change is necessary to avoid confusion [3]. The Court found that the petitioner's surname "Rotaquio" indeed gave rise to confusion as it was often perceived as his Christian name [3]. Consequently, the request was not considered arbitrary or whimsical, especially since there was no claim that the petitioner sought the change for any unlawful purpose [3, 4].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [5].
