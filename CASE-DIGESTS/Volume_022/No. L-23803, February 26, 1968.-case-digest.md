I. CAPTION
C. F. SHARP & COMPANY, INC. v. COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-23803, February 26, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On April 1, 1962, the vessel M/L Cheton, owned by petitioner, was apprehended by the Bureau of Customs water patrol near the Manila breakwater carrying 1,865 cartons of untaxed "blue seal" cigarettes. The vessel was seized for violation of Section 2530(a) of the Tariff and Customs Code. The petitioner claimed the crew was forced by armed men to load the cigarettes under duress. The Collector of Customs imposed a fine of P10,000, but upon appeal, the Commissioner of Customs modified the decision and ordered the forfeiture of the vessel. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the Commissioner's decision, disregarding the crew's affidavits regarding duress due to lack of credibility. Petitioner appealed, arguing denial of due process and citing the crew's acquittal in a related criminal case.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the M/L Cheton is subject to forfeiture under Section 2530(a) of the Tariff and Customs Code.
2. W/N the Commissioner of Customs violated due process by rendering a decision without a formal hearing.
3. W/N the acquittal of the crew in the criminal case bars the forfeiture of the vessel.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The vessel was apprehended carrying untaxed cigarettes without necessary papers, making it subject to forfeiture under Section 2530(a) of the Tariff and Customs Code. Once the vessel was found with smuggled goods, the burden shifted to the owner to prove the carriage was lawful [1]. The Supreme Court upheld the CTA's rejection of the "duress" defense, ruling that appellate courts generally do not interfere with the lower courts' findings on witness credibility [2].

2. **NO.** Section 2313 of the Tariff and Customs Code does not require the Commissioner of Customs to hold a formal hearing; his duty is to review the case based on the records and evidence presented to the Collector. Furthermore, the proceedings before the CTA were a trial *de novo*, offering the petitioner ample opportunity to present evidence [3, 4].

3. **NO.** Forfeiture proceedings are civil and administrative in nature and are not dependent on the result of criminal proceedings. The acquittal of the crew in a separate criminal case, which depends on the evidence adduced therein, does not influence the judgment in the forfeiture case [5].

The judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [6].
