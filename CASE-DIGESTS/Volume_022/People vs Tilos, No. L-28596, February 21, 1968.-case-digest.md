I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SANTIAGO TILOS, G.R. No. L-28596, February 21, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On January 6, 1965, detention prisoners Santiago Tilos and Rolando Banhao were taken out of their cells in the Negros Occidental Provincial Jail. Around 11:00 P.M., Rolando Castillo, the son of a provincial guard, invited them to a dance near the jail. They slipped out through the rear gate. At the dance hall, a sudden shower caused the crowd to rush out for cover. Amidst this confusion, Banhao saw Tilos stab Gaudencio Olivas. The group then ran back to the jail. Olivas died the next day from the stab wound. Tilos was charged with murder. The defense claimed Tilos never left the jail, presenting a "Custodian's Report" that did not list him as released that day, and argued that Banhao testified falsely due to a prior quarrel over food rationing. The trial court convicted Tilos of murder and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the credibility of the prosecution eyewitness is impaired by a prior quarrel with the accused.
2. W/N the killing was attended by treachery.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A previous quarrel over food rationing, while capable of causing bad feelings, is not sufficient motive for a witness to testify falsely and impute a grave offense like murder against the defendant [1, 2]. The Court affirmed the rule that the trial court's findings on witness credibility should not be disturbed absent serious, forceful, and cogent reasons [1, 2]. Furthermore, the "Custodian's Report" was not conclusive, as the guard himself admitted taking Tilos out of his cell that day [3].

2. **YES.** Although the Solicitor General recommended a conviction for homicide only, the Court found that treachery was adequately established [4]. The accused deliberately took advantage of the confusion created by the sudden rain shower to stab the deceased. This circumstance ensured that his act and identity would not be detected by the crowd and facilitated his escape [1, 4].

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [5].
