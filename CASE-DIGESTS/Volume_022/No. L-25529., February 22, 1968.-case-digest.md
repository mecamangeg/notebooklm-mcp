I. CAPTION
BENJAMIN PANGANIBAN and MARIA CASTOR v. ARACELI VDA. DE STA. MARIA and FEDERICO STO. TOMAS, G.R. No. L-25529, February 22, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Panganiban and Castor filed a complaint for damages against defendants Vda. de Sta. Maria and Sto. Tomas regarding the construction of dams on the Maasim River [1]. After the lower court denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, the case was set for hearing on July 7, 1965 [2, 3].

On July 3, 1965, plaintiffs' counsel filed a motion for postponement because he was scheduled to leave for abroad on that date and would not return until July 10. The defendants' counsel expressly agreed to the postponement by signing a *conforme* on the motion [3, 4]. Despite this, when the case was called on July 7, 1965, the lower court dismissed the complaint and counterclaim for failure to prosecute because neither parties nor their counsel appeared [5]. The plaintiffs appealed, questioning the dismissal and the earlier denial of their motion for summary judgment [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellate court may review the lower court's order denying the motion for summary judgment.
2. W/N the lower court erred in dismissing the case for failure to prosecute despite the agreed motion for postponement.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the appellants cannot properly raise the denial of the summary judgment because they failed to state in their notice of appeal that they were appealing from that specific order (the order of March 16, 1965) [6]. Section 4, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court mandates that the notice of appeal "shall designate the judgment or order or part thereof, appealed from" [6]. The use of "shall" emphasizes the mandatory nature of this provision to allow courts to determine which orders are subject to the appeal [6].

2. **YES.** While the allowance of postponements rests on the sound discretion of the judge, such discretion must serve the ends of justice and fairness, not merely the convenience of the court [7]. The Supreme Court found that the motion was filed seasonably (four days before the hearing), the reason was valid (counsel’s professional travel), and there was no intent to delay [4]. Furthermore, the defendants consented to the postponement, indicating they would suffer no prejudice [8]. Citing *Camara Vda. de Zubiri v. Zubiri* and *Rexwell Corporation v. Canlas*, the Court held that when no substantial rights are affected and there is no manifest intention to delay, it is sound judicial discretion to allow the postponement [7].

The order appealed from is **REVERSED** and set aside, and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [8].
