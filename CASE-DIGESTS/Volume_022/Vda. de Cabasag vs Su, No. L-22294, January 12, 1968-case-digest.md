I. CAPTION
DIONISIA PARAMI VDA. DE CABASAG v. AMADOR P. SU, et al., G.R. No. L-22294, January 12, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Dionisia Parami Vda. de Cabasag and her late husband, who were illiterate, were allegedly induced by respondents to thumbmark a document represented as a debt acknowledgment of P4,000.00, but which turned out to be a deed of absolute sale for P11,000.00. Petitioner filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Misamis Occidental for the nullification of the deed of sale and the recovery of land and damages totaling P122,000.00 [1, 2]. The respondent judge, Hon. Alfredo Catolico, ordered the case remanded to the Justice of the Peace Court of Sapang Dalaga, ruling that under Republic Act No. 3828, the case fell within the original jurisdiction of the municipal court [2]. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari to reverse the order [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the order remanding the case was erroneous and indefensible. First, Republic Act No. 3828 merely increased the civil jurisdiction of municipal courts to cases involving not more than P10,000.00, while the petitioner's claim for damages totaled P122,000.00 and the respondents' counterclaim was P105,000.00 [4, 5]. Second, the complaint specifically prayed for the **nullification of a deed of sale** and the consequent recovery of a piece of land [5]. Such subject matter falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court), and not that of inferior courts which can only pass upon title to land as an incident to forcible entry and detainer suits under Section 88 of the Judiciary Act (citing *Pajarillo vs. Manahan*) [5].

The writ was granted, the order complained of was annulled, and the case was remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings [6].
