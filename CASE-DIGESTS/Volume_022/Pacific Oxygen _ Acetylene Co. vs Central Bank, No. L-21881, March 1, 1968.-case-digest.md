I. CAPTION
PACIFIC OXYGEN & ACETYLENE COMPANY v. CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21881, March 1, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Pacific Oxygen & Acetylene Co. opened a letter of credit through Philippine Trust Company (an agent of the Central Bank) to import a plant from the United States. To cover the dollar commitment, Philippine Trust Company applied for the purchase of forward exchange with the Central Bank (CB) on January 17, 1962. The CB executed the forward exchange contract the next day, January 18, 1962.

On January 21, 1962, the CB suspended the margin levy on foreign exchange sales. The drafts drawn by the foreign beneficiary were honored by the correspondent bank only on February 9 and 13, 1962. Pacific Oxygen paid the 15% margin fee amounting to P30,839.49 under protest and sued for a refund. The lower court ruled in favor of Pacific Oxygen, citing the *Belman* doctrine that the date of payment/delivery determines tax liability. The CB appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the margin fee was validly collected despite the suspension of the margin levy before the foreign drafts were honored.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's judgment.

The Court applied Republic Act No. 2609, which authorizes the collection of a margin fee on "all sales of foreign exchange." Under Article 1458 of the Civil Code, a sale exists from the moment a party obligates himself to transfer ownership and the other to pay the price. Perfection occurs upon the meeting of minds (Article 1475, Civil Code).

Since the forward exchange contract was executed on January 18, 1962—prior to the January 21, 1962 suspension of the levy—the sale was already perfected, and the margin fee was properly imposed. The fact that the drafts were honored later is not controlling. The Court held that the clear mandate of RA 2609 prevails over the dictum in *Belman Cia., Inc. v. Central Bank*, which is not authoritative in this context.

The judgment is reversed.
