I. CAPTION
AMERICAN INSURANCE COMPANY v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-27776, January 31, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff American Insurance Company, as subrogee, filed a suit in the City Court of Manila against defendants Manila Port Service and Manila Railroad Company for the recovery of P4,054.20, representing losses and damages to a shipment of cork rods discharged into defendants' custody [1, 2]. The City Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff [2].

Defendants appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. During the pre-trial conference scheduled on January 11, 1967, neither the defendants nor their counsel appeared, despite the plaintiff being present [2]. Consequently, upon plaintiff's motion and noting previous postponements requested by defendants, the CFI dismissed the appeal and remanded the case to the lower court for execution [3]. Ten minutes later, a substitute lawyer appeared for the defendants to request a postponement, citing the counsel of record's emergency, but the court denied the motion and the subsequent Motion for Reconsideration [3]. Defendants appealed to the Supreme Court, challenging the dismissal [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CFI correctly dismissed the defendants' appeal for failure to appear at the pre-trial conference.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the appeal. Under the Revised Rules of Court, pre-trial is mandatory, and both parties and their counsel are required to appear [4]. Section 2, Rule 20 explicitly provides that a party who fails to appear at a pre-trial conference may be non-suited or considered in default [4].

In this case, the Court found that the trial court did not err in denying the postponement requested by the substitute lawyer who arrived late, especially considering that the defendants themselves failed to appear and had previously requested several postponements [5]. The failure of the defendants and their counsel to appear justified a finding of failure to prosecute the appeal [5]. Applying Section 9 of Rule 40, when an appeal is dismissed for failure to prosecute, the judgment of the lower court is deemed revived and the case is remanded for execution [5].

The appealed order of dismissal is affirmed [6].
