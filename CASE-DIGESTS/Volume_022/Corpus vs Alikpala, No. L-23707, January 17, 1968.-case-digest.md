I. CAPTION
JOSE A. V. CORPUS v. HON. FEDERICO C. ALIKPALA, as Presiding Judge of Branch XXII, Court of First Instance of Manila and ACME STEEL MANUFACTURING CO., INC., G.R. Nos. L-23707 & L-23720, January 17, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jose Corpus filed a foreclosure suit against respondent Acme Steel Manufacturing Co., Inc. (Acme). The parties entered into a compromise agreement, approved by the court, wherein Acme agreed to pay the P100,000 balance by December 15, 1965. As consideration for this period, Acme agreed to pay advance interest of P12,000 in installments. The agreement stipulated that failure to pay any amount would entitle Corpus to a writ of execution for the entire balance.

Acme paid the first interest installment but issued a postdated check for the second installment (P6,000), which was dishonored for insufficiency of funds. Corpus moved for execution, which the trial court granted. Acme appealed this order. Despite Corpus's opposition, the trial court (Judge Alikpala) allowed the appeal and suspended the execution. Corpus filed a petition for certiorari (L-23707) to nullify the allowance of the appeal, while Acme prosecuted its appeal (L-23720).

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the order of execution is appealable.
2. W/N Acme lost the right to the period agreed upon in the compromise, justifying immediate execution.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The general rule is that an order of execution is not appealable; otherwise, cases would never end. The only exceptions are: (1) where the order varies the tenor of the judgment; and (2) when the terms of the judgment are not clear and there is room for interpretation. The Court distinguished this case from *Cotton v. Almeda-Lopez*, noting that the compromise agreement here was complete, definite, and certain, with no suspensive conditions requiring judicial interpretation. The order of execution did not vary the tenor of the judgment but was in accord with it; hence, the order was not appealable and the trial court gravely abused its discretion in allowing the appeal.

2. **YES.** Acme lost the right to the payment period. The advance payment of interest was the main consideration for Corpus agreeing to delay the payment of the principal until December 15, 1965. Under **Article 1198, paragraph 4 of the Civil Code**, the debtor loses every right to make use of the period when he violates any undertaking in consideration of which the creditor agreed to the period. The dishonor of the check constituted a violation of this undertaking. Furthermore, under **Article 1249 of the Civil Code**, the acceptance of the check did not produce the effect of payment until the value was realized. Upon dishonor, Acme automatically became in default.

The Order of execution is **AFFIRMED**.
