I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ISAIAS MACALISANG, G.R. No. L-24546, February 22, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On the morning of November 14, 1949, in Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental, a shootout occurred between political rivals, killing the incumbent Mayor and critically wounding the appellant, Chief of Police Isaias Macalisang. Fr. William Bourke rushed the wounded appellant to Ozamis City in his jeep. While the jeep was negotiating a curve in Barrio Casoy, the appellant saw Francisco Dano, a known supporter of the rival faction, standing by the roadside. The appellant pointed his gun at Dano and fired, hitting him in the back. Dano died later that day, but not before identifying the appellant as the shooter in a dying declaration. At trial, the appellant claimed he was unconscious due to his injuries and shock at the time of the shooting. The Court of First Instance convicted him of murder qualified by treachery and sentenced him to life imprisonment.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellant was conscious and acted voluntarily when he shot the victim.
2. W/N the killing was qualified by treachery.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A criminal act is presumed to be voluntary, and speculation cannot overturn this presumption. While the appellant's doctor testified to a "probability" of unconsciousness due to the appellant's injuries, positive evidence established that the appellant was conscious: he took the precaution of placing his revolver on his lap, was seen aiming the gun, and later admitted to a police captain, "I was the one who shot Mr. Dano." Fact prevails over assumption.

2. **NO.** The crime committed is Homicide, not Murder. The mere location of the bullet wound at the back or the suddenness of the attack does not proved treachery where the meeting was accidental. The appellant was in a running jeep and the attack was an "impulse of the moment" upon seeing the victim. There was no evidence that the method of assault was deliberately chosen to ensure the offender's safety.

The judgment is **MODIFIED**. The appellant is convicted of Homicide. Being a recidivist, he is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of *prisión mayor* to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of *reclusión temporal*, and to indemnify the heirs.
