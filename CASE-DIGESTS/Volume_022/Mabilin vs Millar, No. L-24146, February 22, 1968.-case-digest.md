I. CAPTION
MIGUEL MABILIN, VICTORIANO MABILIN, and MARIA DE LA PAZ MABILIN v. EUSEBIO S. MILLAR, G.R. No. L-24146, February 22, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Mabilin filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Quezon to cancel liens annotated on Original Certificates of Title Nos. 22749 and 22918, which were registered in the name of Camilo Cabuyao [1, 2]. The liens were a Writ of Attachment dated 1936 and a Writ of Execution dated 1940, both in favor of oppositor Eusebio Millar [3]. Petitioners claimed they were the grandchildren and successors of Cabuyao and argued that the obligations secured by the liens had prescribed [4, 5].

Millar opposed the petition, denying that petitioners were the lawful heirs of the registered owner and disputing the claim of prescription, arguing that the levy on execution suspended the prescriptive period [4]. Despite the opposition and without conducting a hearing or receiving evidence, the lower court granted the petition and ordered the Register of Deeds to cancel the liens based on Section 112 of the Land Registration Act [6, 7]. Millar appealed, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction to resolve the matter summarily [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Land Registration Court has jurisdiction to order the cancellation of liens under Section 112 of the Land Registration Act when the parties lack unanimity and raise controversial issues.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that proceedings under Section 112 of the Land Registration Act are summary in nature and are permissible only when the issues presented are "so patently unsubstantial as not to be genuine issues" [9]. Relief under this section requires unanimity among the parties or the absence of an adverse claim or serious objection by any party in interest [9]. If the case becomes controversial, it must be threshed out in an ordinary case or in the proceeding where the incident properly belongs [9].

Here, the pleadings revealed real and substantial issues: Millar disputed the petitioners' right to succeed to the ownership of the land and contested the prescription of the obligation secured by the liens [10]. These controversial matters are beyond the limited authority of a land registration court to pass upon after the entry of the original decree of registration [10].

The Order of the lower court is **SET ASIDE** [11].
