I. CAPTION
AMELITO R. MUTUC, et al. v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, et al., G.R. No. L-28517, February 21, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners (NP candidates) and private respondents (LP candidates) ran for local offices in Makati, Rizal during the November 14, 1967 elections. During the canvassing, the Municipal Board of Canvassers (MBC) found the election return from Precinct 124 blank or incomplete, containing no entry of votes for any candidate, although it indicated 263 votes were cast. The MBC initially petitioned the CFI to open the ballot boxes but later asked the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) for authority to proclaim winners disregarding Precinct 124, arguing the 263 votes would not materially affect the results. COMELEC granted the request on November 24, 1967. Respondents were proclaimed the next day. Petitioners challenged this, arguing that the difference between the 8th winning councilor and the 1st losing candidate was only 221 votes, making the 263 votes in Precinct 124 decisive.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the COMELEC has the power to authorize a proclamation based on a canvass that disregards a return from one precinct.
2. W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the case despite the respondents' proclamation and assumption of office.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** An incomplete canvass of votes is illegal and cannot be the basis of a subsequent proclamation. Under Sections 160 and 168 of the Revised Election Code, it is the ministerial duty of the canvassing body to count *all* votes cast. To disregard returns is to disenfranchise voters. The COMELEC lacks the power to decide questions involving the right to vote; instead of disregarding the return, it should have ordered the opening of the ballot box to retrieve the return deposited therein, or if also blank, to count the ballots, in fulfillment of its constitutional duty to ensure "free, orderly, and honest elections."

2. **YES.** While the remedy after a valid proclamation is an election protest, this rule applies only when the proclamation is valid. Where the proclamation is illegal because it was based on an incomplete canvass, as in this case, the assumption of office does not affect the Supreme Court's jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case.

The COMELEC resolutions were set aside, the proclamation annulled, and the COMELEC was directed to order the opening of the ballot box in Precinct 124 to retrieve the return or count the ballots for a new canvass.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Fernando, J. (Concurring):** noted that this ruling modifies the *Acain* doctrine. A patently illegal proclamation is devoid of legal force and considered as not having taken place; thus, the COMELEC and the Court may still intervene to ensure a proper canvass even if an election protest or *quo warranto* has been filed.
