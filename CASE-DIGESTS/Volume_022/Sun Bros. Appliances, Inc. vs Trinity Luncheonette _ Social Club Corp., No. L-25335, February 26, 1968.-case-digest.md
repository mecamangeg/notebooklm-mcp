I. CAPTION
SUN BROS. APPLIANCES, INC. v. TRINITY LUNCHEONETTE & SOCIAL CLUB CORPORATION, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25335, February 26, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Sun Bros. Appliances, Inc. sold two air conditioners to Trinity Luncheonette & Social Club Corp. under a conditional sale agreement where Sun Bros. retained title until full payment. Trinity Luncheonette defaulted on installments. Subsequently, the Sheriff of Manila attached the air conditioners pursuant to a writ of attachment in a separate civil case filed by Trinity Investment Co., Inc. against Trinity Luncheonette.

Sun Bros. filed a third-party claim over the units. To maintain the attachment, Trinity Investment posted an indemnity bond in favor of the Sheriff through Capital Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. (Capital Insurance). The Sheriff then sold the properties at public auction. Sun Bros. filed an action for damages against Trinity Luncheonette, Trinity Investment, the Sheriff, and Capital Insurance. The trial court absolved the Sheriff but ordered the other defendants, including Capital Insurance, to pay Sun Bros. jointly and severally. It also ordered Trinity Investment to reimburse Capital Insurance. Capital Insurance appealed, arguing that since the Sheriff was absolved of liability, the surety executing the bond in the Sheriff's favor should also be absolved.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the surety on an indemnity bond (Capital Insurance) is liable for damages resulting from a wrongful attachment even if the Sheriff who performed the act was absolved.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the liability of the surety. The Court held that the execution of an indemnity bond in favor of the Sheriff to indemnify him against damages from an unlawful levy establishes the liability of the indemnitor and his bondsmen as **principals** in the subsequent trespass committed by the Sheriff.

The Court relied on the doctrine in *Alzua and Arnalot v. Johnson* and *Waite v. Peterson*, stating that the bond is equivalent to personal interference by the indemnitor and bondsmen. By posting the bond, they assume control and direction of the Sheriff's future actions, making them responsible for the continued wrongful possession, sale, and conversion of the goods. Thus, Capital Insurance is liable for the real damages suffered by the plaintiff, independent of the Sheriff's personal liability.

**WHEREFORE**, the judgment appealed from is **AFFIRMED**, with the **MODIFICATION** that Trinity Investment Co., Inc. is ordered to pay Capital Insurance interest at 12% per annum and attorney's fees of 15% of the claim based on their indemnity agreement.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
