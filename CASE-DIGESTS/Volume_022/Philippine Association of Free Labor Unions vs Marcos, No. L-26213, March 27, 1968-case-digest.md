I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE ASSOCIATION OF FREE LABOR UNIONS (PAFLU) and BAGUIO AMALGAMATED RADIO ANNOUNCERS AND EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION (PAFLU) v. HON. PIO R. MARCOS and RADIO PHILIPPINES NETWORK, INC., G.R. No. L-26213, March 27, 1968, 23 SCRA 446, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On June 17, 1966, respondent Radio Philippines Network, Inc. filed Civil Case 1697 in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Baguio against petitioners for injunction with damages, alleging that the union staged an illegal strike and caused damage to the station's property [1]. On June 20, 1966, petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the labor dispute was connected with an unfair labor practice (ULP) charge they had previously filed on May 22, 1966, in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [2]. The CFI denied the motion, ruling it was without merit [3]. Petitioners filed a special civil action of certiorari with the Supreme Court, contending the CFI lacked jurisdiction [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the labor dispute despite the prior filing of an unfair labor practice charge in the Court of Industrial Relations.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that while a labor dispute involving an unfair labor practice is exclusively cognizable by the Court of Industrial Relations under Sec. 5(a) of Republic Act 875, the mere filing of a ULP charge does not, *per se*, establish the necessary connection to divest the CFI of jurisdiction [5]. To remove jurisdiction from the CFI, there must be a competent showing—not mere allegation—that the acts complained of in the petition for injunction arose out of, or are interwoven with, the unfair labor practice case (*United Pepsi-Cola Sales Organization v. Cañizares*) [5, 6].

In this case, the petitioners failed to provide satisfactory evidence that the strike and dispute in Civil Case 1697 were connected to the ULP charge, nor could such connection be inferred from the general language of the charge [7]. Consequently, the CFI was not sufficiently apprised of the connection to warrant dismissal of the civil case at that stage [6].

The petition is **DISMISSED** and the preliminary injunction is revoked [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred with the decision [8].
