I. CAPTION
DOMACAO ALONTO, et al. v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, et al., G.R. No. L-28490, February 28, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., Actg. C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, Liberal Party candidates for provincial offices in Lanao del Sur during the November 14, 1967 elections, petitioned the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to permanently suspend the canvass of votes in 27 municipalities. They argued that the election returns were "obviously manufactured" due to an alleged excess of votes over registered voters and the fact that the COMELEC had already rejected these returns in the senatorial count. Furthermore, petitioners contended the canvass was void because the counting of votes was not conducted in the designated polling places immediately after the voting, but rather in Philippine Constabulary (PC) camps three days later, in violation of Sections 144 and 151 of the Election Code. The COMELEC dismissed the petition, ruling it had no authority to look beyond the face of the returns and that the allegations were proper for an election protest. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the COMELEC's rejection of returns in the senatorial count requires the Provincial Board of Canvassers to reject the same returns.
2. W/N the alleged excess of votes renders the returns "obviously manufactured" based on the doctrine of statistical improbability.
3. W/N the transfer of the counting of votes to PC camps renders the canvass null and void.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The COMELEC's power to reject returns in its role as a senatorial canvasser does not authorize it to impose the same criterion in advance upon Provincial Boards of Canvassers. The Provincial Boards are entitled to use their own judgment, especially since the copies of returns in their possession may differ from those held by the COMELEC. If discrepancies exist, the remedy is a judicial recount under Section 163 of the Election Code, not an *a priori* rejection [1].

2. **NO.** The alleged excess of votes does not necessarily make returns "obviously manufactured" under the "statistical improbability" rule established in *Lagumbay v. Comelec*. The Court found no evidence of uniformity of tallies or systematic blanking of opposing candidates, which were the factual bases for the *Lagumbay* doctrine. The Court warned against the undue expansion of said doctrine (*Sangki v. Comelec*) [2].

3. **NO.** External circumstances, such as imminent violence and "political passions," may compel the transfer of ballot boxes to places of safety (like PC camps) to prevent the frustration of the popular will. To deny the COMELEC authority to provide safeguards would be unrealistic, and requiring officials to risk their lives to strictly follow the letter of the law (Secs. 144 and 151, Election Code) constitutes "extreme idolatry" that defeats the law's primary end. Moreover, allegations of terrorism and irregularities are matters for a regular election protest, not a pre-proclamation controversy (*Abes v. Comelec*) [3, 4].

Petition dismissed [5].
