**I. CAPTION**
**JOSE S. CAPISTRANO v. THE HON. JUDGE JUAN BOCAR of the Court of First Instance of Manila and ZACARIAS MANABAT, G.R. No. L-24707, January 18, 1968, 22 SCRA 156, Bengzon, J.P., J.**

**II. FACTS**
Following a union election in December 1964, the election committee initially proclaimed petitioner Jose Capistrano as president. However, respondent Zacarias Manabat protested, leading to a recount where 400 votes were invalidated for lacking the election secretary's signature. Consequently, Manabat was proclaimed the winner. Capistrano filed a protest with the Secretary of Labor, while a group of union members simultaneously filed a complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP) with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), questioning the invalidation of the votes [1-3].

While the ULP case was pending, Manabat filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila (presided by respondent Judge Bocar). Manabat argued that the Department of Labor lacked jurisdiction over the internal union dispute under Section 17 of Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act) and sought to enjoin the implementation of the Department's decision favoring Capistrano. Despite Capistrano's motion to dismiss arguing that jurisdiction was vested in the CIR, the CFI assumed jurisdiction and issued a preliminary injunction [4, 5]. Capistrano filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over questions involving the rights and conditions of membership in a labor organization under Section 17 of R.A. 875.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Court of First Instance (CFI) has no jurisdiction over the subject matter.

The Court relied on Section 17 of R.A. 875, which governs internal labor organization procedures. While the section refers to the "Court" generally, Section 2 of the same Act explicitly defines "Court" as the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), unless otherwise specified [7, 8]. The Court reiterated settled jurisprudence (*Kapisanan ng mga Manggagawa sa MRR v. Bugay*, *PLASLU v. Ortiz*) establishing that questions involving rights and conditions of membership in a labor organization fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the CIR [8].

Furthermore, the CFI erred in taking cognizance of the petition because a related unfair labor practice case regarding the same election was already pending before the CIR. The CIR had already acquired complete jurisdiction over the matter to the exclusion of the CFI [8].

**WHEREFORE**, it is hereby declared that the Court of First Instance of Manila has no jurisdiction over its Civil Case No. 58912; said case should therefore be dismissed and the preliminary injunction therein issued, dissolved [9].
