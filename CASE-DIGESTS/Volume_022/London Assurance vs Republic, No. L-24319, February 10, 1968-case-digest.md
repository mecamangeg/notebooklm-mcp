**I. CAPTION**
**THE LONDON ASSURANCE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, CUSTOMS ARRASTRE SERVICE, et al.**, G.R. No. L-24319, February 10, 1968, Angeles, J.

**II. FACTS**
On November 4, 1964, The London Assurance, as insurer-subrogee, filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against the Republic of the Philippines, the Bureau of Customs, and the Customs Arrastre Service for the recovery of P7,235.63 [1]. This amount represented the insured value of a shipment of 22 skids of electrolytic tinplate waste consigned to Consolidated Can Corporation [1]. The Solicitor General moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the State is immune from suit and that the Bureau of Customs and Customs Arrastre Service are not juridical entities with the personality to be sued [2]. The CFI granted the motion to dismiss [2]. The plaintiff appealed, contending that the defendants were performing proprietary or non-governmental functions as arrastre operators and were therefore liable to suit [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs can be sued for their operation of the arrastre service.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. Relying on the doctrine established in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service* (L-23139, Dec. 17, 1966), the Court held that while the arrastre function may be deemed proprietary, it is a "necessary incident of the primary and governmental function of the Bureau of Customs" [3, 4]. Therefore, engaging in this service does not render the Bureau liable to suit [4]. The Court reasoned that sovereign immunity granted as to the end (the governmental function) should not be denied as to the necessary means to that end (the arrastre service) [4].

The order appealed from is hereby affirmed [4].
