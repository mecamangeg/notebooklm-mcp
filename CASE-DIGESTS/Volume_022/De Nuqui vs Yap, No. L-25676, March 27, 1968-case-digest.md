I. CAPTION
ROSENDA A. DE NUQUI, ET AL. v. ILDEFONSO D. YAP, G.R. No. L-25676, March 27, 1968, 22 SCRA 1303, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs filed Civil Case No. 1907 in the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental for rescission of a contract against defendant Ildefonso D. Yap. On March 31, 1960, the trial court rendered a decision ordering Yap to restore properties and pay plaintiffs P300.00 monthly rental, but the decision did not specify legal interest [1, 2]. On May 10, 1960, plaintiffs moved for reconsideration requesting the imposition of legal interest [3]. On May 14, 1960, the trial court issued an order amending the dispositive portion to include legal interest on the monthly rentals from July 31, 1956 [3].

Yap perfected his appeal to the Supreme Court on June 25, 1960 (docketed as G.R. No. L-17681-82), which included the May 14 amendment in the Record on Appeal [4]. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision with modification only as to attorney's fees [5]. Upon execution, the lower court ordered Yap to pay the legal interest pursuant to the May 14, 1960 amendment [6, 7]. Yap appealed, arguing that the March 31, 1960 judgment became final without interest and that the modification was ineffective because the original judgment was not "revoked" [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court validly modified its judgment to include legal interest before the perfection of the appeal without totally revoking the original decision.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The modification was valid. The Supreme Court held that the trial court's authority to modify its judgment cannot be challenged because the amendment was made on May 14, 1960, prior to the perfection of the appeal on June 25, 1960, while the court still had control over the judgment [8, 9].

The Court rejected Yap's reliance on *Cordovero v. Villaruz* and *Robles v. Timario*. There is no rule requiring that when a court partially reconsiders a judgment not yet final, the former judgment must be totally revoked and a new one rendered [9]. Unlike in *Cordovero*, no new trial was granted here, so total revocation was unnecessary. Unlike in *Robles*, the judgment here was modified before it became final [9]. Furthermore, Yap failed to question the inclusion of interest in his previous appeal (G.R. No. L-17681-82) despite the amendment appearing in the Record on Appeal [8].

Orders affirmed with treble costs against appellant's counsel [10].
