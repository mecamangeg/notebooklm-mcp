I. CAPTION
In re: Petition for Change of Names of Antonio Ang Gui, et al., Virginia Basas v. Republic of the Philippines, G.R. No. L-23595, February 20, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner-appellant Virginia Basas filed a petition to change the names of her minor children—Antonio Ang Gui, Alberto Basas Ang, Ernesto Basas Ang, and Evelyn Basas Ang—to use the surname "Basas" [1]. She alleged that the minors were her illegitimate children with a Chinese father who had a valid marriage in China [2, 3]. While the children were registered in the Local Civil Registrar under the surnames "Ang" or "Ang Gui," they were baptized using the surname "Chua" [1]. Basas claimed these discrepancies caused confusion regarding the children's identities, particularly during school enrollment [1]. The Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court dismissed the petition, ruling that the petitioners' claim of Filipino citizenship was open to doubt, their filiation was not satisfactorily proven, and that aliens cannot avail of Rule 103 [2, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for change of name should be granted despite doubts regarding citizenship and filiation.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. A petition for a change of name will not be entertained if the petitioner's citizenship is either controverted or doubtful, as aliens cannot avail themselves of Rule 103 [4, 5]. The Court held that judicial proceedings should not be utilized to circumvent constitutional and statutory policies regarding citizenship [5]. Furthermore, the petition was predicated on facts involving the minors' filiation to a man not party to the case—implicating issues of concubinage and nationality—which cannot be determined in a change of name proceeding [6]. The Court also noted that approving the change might unwittingly give legal effect to a substitution of identity, given the unexplained use of the surname "Chua" in baptismal records versus "Ang" in civil records [6, 7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
