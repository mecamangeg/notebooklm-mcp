**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AGAPITO YAP, JR., G.R. No. L-25176, February 27, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Agapito Yap, Jr. was convicted of simple seduction by the Municipal Court of Baliangao upon the complaint of Catalina Babol [1]. He appealed to the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental, where an Information was filed charging him with Simple Seduction [1]. The Information alleged that "on or about May 15, 1959, and for sometime subsequent thereto," Yap, by means of deceit and false promise of marriage, seduced and had sexual intercourse "several times" with the complainant, resulting in pregnancy and abortion [2]. Yap moved to quash the Information, arguing it violated the rule against duplicity of offenses by alleging multiple acts of seduction and criminal abortion [3]. The trial court ordered the amendment of the Information to prevent the accused from being placed in danger of conviction for two crimes or more than once, threatening dismissal otherwise [3]. The prosecution appealed the order to the Supreme Court [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Information alleging sexual intercourse "several times" violates the prohibition against duplicity of offenses.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Information charged only one offense of simple seduction. The Court reasoned that different acts of intercourse, consented to by the woman in reliance upon the same promise of marriage, do not constitute separate offenses of seduction [5]. The recital of facts regarding sexual relations "several times," subsequent pregnancy, and abortion constitute mere details of the single seduction charge [6]. These allegations partake of the nature of a bill of particulars intended to inform the accused of what the prosecution intends to prove, which is not prohibited by the Rules of Court [6].

The order appealed from is set aside, and the case is remanded to the lower court for proceedings on the merits [7].
