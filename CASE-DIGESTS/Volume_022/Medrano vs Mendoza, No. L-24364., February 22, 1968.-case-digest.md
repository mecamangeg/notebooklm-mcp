I. CAPTION
BIENVENIDO MEDRANO v. HON. FILEMON MENDOZA and THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-24364, February 22, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On November 29, 1963, a criminal complaint for grave threats was filed against Petitioner Medrano in the Municipal Court of Ibaan, Batangas, for an incident that occurred on September 30, 1963. Petitioner moved to quash the complaint for non-conformance to the prescribed form and for charging more than one offense. The court eventually ordered the prosecution to amend the complaint to charge only "light threats" within five days from March 18, 1964. The prosecutor failed to comply within the period, filing the amended complaint only on April 15, 1964, or 28 days later. Petitioner argued that the crime had prescribed, contending that the delay constituted an unjustifiable stoppage of the proceedings for reasons not imputable to him. The Court of First Instance of Batangas dismissed the petition.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the crime of light threats prescribed due to the delay in filing the amended complaint.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that prescription had not set in. Under Article 91 of the Revised Penal Code, the prescriptive period commences to run again when proceedings "are unjustifiably stopped for any reason not imputable to" the accused. In this case, the delay was not an unjustifiable stoppage "not imputable" to the accused because: (1) the stoppage was caused by the Petitioner's own motion to quash and insistence that the charge be changed; and (2) the Municipal Court, exercising its discretion, validly excused the delay and accepted the amended charge, noting that the order to amend did not specify that failure to file within five days would result in the dismissal of the original complaint [1-3]. The Court affirmed the judgment of the lower court.
