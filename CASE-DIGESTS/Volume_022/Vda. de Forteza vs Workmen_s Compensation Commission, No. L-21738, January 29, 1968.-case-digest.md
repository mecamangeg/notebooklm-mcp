I. CAPTION
MILAGROS F. VDA. DE FORTEZA v. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and PHILIPPINE CHARITY SWEEPSTAKES OFFICE, G.R. No. L-21738, January 29, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Amadeo R. Forteza worked as a watchman for the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO). He was over 60 years old and suffered from hypertension and minimal tuberculosis [1, 2]. His duties required him to work at night, guard the premises, and climb a three-story building without an elevator to check windows and entry points [1, 2]. On the night of January 17, 1955, while on duty, he was found unconscious near his work table and subsequently died of cerebral hemorrhage secondary to arteriosclerotic hypertension [1].

His widow, Milagros Vda. de Forteza, filed a claim for death compensation benefits [3]. The Hearing Officer awarded the claim, but the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed the decision, ruling that hypertension was not an occupational disease and absolved the PCSO of liability [4]. The petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the employee’s death caused by hypertension is compensable under the Workmen's Compensation Act.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the death is compensable. The deceased's working conditions—exposure to cold at night, inadequate rest, tension, and the physical exertion of going up and down a three-story building—could have caused or materially contributed to the stroke [2]. The fact that the stroke occurred near his working table while he was performing his duties justifies the conclusion that the death happened in the course of employment [2, 5].

The Court applied the presumption of compensability under Section 43 of Act 3428, which states that in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, a claim is presumed to come within the provisions of the Act [6]. The employer failed to prove that the death was not traceable to the employment. Furthermore, it is not necessary to prove that employment was the sole cause of death; it is sufficient to show that the employment contributed to the aggravation or acceleration of the ailment [7, 8].

The decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission is **REVERSED**, and the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office is ordered to pay the petitioner the amounts awarded by the Hearing Officer [9].
