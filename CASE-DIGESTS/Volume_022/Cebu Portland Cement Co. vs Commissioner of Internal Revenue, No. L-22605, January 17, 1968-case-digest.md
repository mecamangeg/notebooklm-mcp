**I. CAPTION**
CEBU PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-22605, January 17, 1968, 22 SCRA 65, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Cebu Portland Cement Co., a government-owned corporation, manufactures cement using limestone, silica, and shale quarried from its own mineral lands [1]. For the period of July 1, 1959, to December 31, 1960, Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) levied and collected an ad valorem tax of P190,115.24 under Sec. 243 of the Tax Code [1]. The CIR used the gross sales of cement, minus the cost of cement bags, as the tax basis [1]. Petitioner paid under protest and sought a refund, arguing the tax should be based on the cost of the raw materials [2]. The Court of Tax Appeals denied the refund [2]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, eventually abandoning its "raw materials" argument and alternatively praying that the tax be based on the "bin cost" (cost of production minus cost of bags) [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the ad valorem tax under Sec. 243 of the Tax Code should be assessed based on the selling price of cement *qua* cement.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that cement *qua* cement is no longer a mineral product in the condition envisaged by Sec. 243 of the Tax Code [4]. Citing its previous ruling in *Cebu Portland Cement Co. v. Commissioner* (L-18649), the Court established that what is taxable under the law are the minerals constituting the cement—specifically limestone, silica, and shale—not the finished cement product itself [3, 4]. Therefore, the correct basis for the 1.5% ad valorem tax is the market value of the quarried raw materials, not the gross selling price of the cement [3]. However, since the petitioner limited its prayer to a computation based on "bin cost," the Court granted the refund of P42,810.11 based on equity [5].

The appealed decision is **REVERSED and SET ASIDE**, and the Commissioner is ordered to refund P42,810.11 to the petitioner [5].
