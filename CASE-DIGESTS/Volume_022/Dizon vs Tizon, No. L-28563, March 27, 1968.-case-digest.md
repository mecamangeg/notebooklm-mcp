I. CAPTION
GOV. PEDRO R. DIZON v. HON. TITO V. TIZON, THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF BATAAN and GUILLERMO ARCENAS, G.R. No. L-28563, March 27, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pedro R. Dizon, a candidate for reelection as Provincial Governor of Bataan in the November 14, 1967 elections, filed a petition for mandamus and prohibition in the Court of First Instance to exclude the votes from Precinct No. 18 of Dinalupihan [1]. He alleged the election return was "patently manufactured" because it showed 279 ballots were cast, whereas a certification from the election registrar stated that only 80 persons actually voted and signed the Precinct Book (CE Form No. 1) [1]. Dizon claimed 199 ballots were falsified [1]. The Chairman of the Board of Inspectors and the Poll Clerk explained the discrepancy was due to a lack of time to accomplish the voting record on CE Form No. 1, noting that other voters instead signed the "List of Voters who voted" (CE Form No. 39) [2, 3]. The lower court dismissed the petition, finding the explanation reasonable [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the election return from Precinct No. 18 is "obviously manufactured" such that it should be annulled.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The election return is not "obviously manufactured" within the meaning of the doctrine in *Lagumbay v. Commission on Elections* [5]. The return was regular and complete on its face, and the petitioner failed to object to it during the canvass [5]. The alleged discrepancy was not apparent on the face of the return itself, but rather between the return and an entirely different document (the registrar's certification) [5]. This certification was not material to the Board of Canvassers, whose ministerial duty is to canvass results based on returns that appear genuine [6]. Furthermore, the discrepancy was reasonably explained by the fact that voters signed CE Form No. 39 instead of the Precinct Book [3, 4].

The petition is dismissed [7].
