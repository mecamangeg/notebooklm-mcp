I. CAPTION
TOMAS TRIA TIRONA v. THE CITY TREASURER OF MANILA and/or CITY OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-24607, January 29, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tomas Tria Tirona held a USAFFE Backpay Certificate and sought to use it to pay his real estate taxes to the City of Manila for the years 1960 to 1963 [2, 3]. Although he had successfully used the certificate for previous years, the City Mayor prohibited the acceptance of such certificates for city obligations in 1958 [2, 3]. Consequently, the City Treasurer refused the payment [3]. Tirona filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to compel the City to accept the certificate [4]. The CFI ruled in favor of Tirona, holding that the right to pay taxes with the certificate is mandatory [4]. The respondents appealed, arguing that acceptance is discretionary and that compulsory acceptance impairs the obligation of contracts, citing the earlier case of *De Borja v. Gella* [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City of Manila is required to accept the backpay certificate in payment of real estate taxes.
2. W/N the compulsory acceptance constitutes an impairment of the obligation of contracts.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The City is mandatorily required to accept the certificate. The Court ruled that Section 2 of Republic Act No. 304, as amended by Republic Act No. 897, expressly declares the applicability of backpay certificates to the payment of "his taxes" without any specific limitation regarding when the tax obligation accrued [7]. This statutory right overrides the rule in *De Borja v. Gella* [7]. The phrase "who may be willing to accept the same" in the law refers only to private citizens or corporations, not to the Government or its agencies [8]. Furthermore, the "Government of the Philippines," which is mandated to redeem these certificates, includes local government units like the City of Manila [9].

2. **NO.** There is no impairment of the obligation of contracts. The City of Manila cannot be classified as a "citizen, association, or corporation" under Section 2 of the Act and thus does not enjoy the protection against impairment in this context [10]. Whatever unfavorable financial effects the acceptance may have on the City are deemed intended by the Legislature, which exercises full control over municipal corporations [10].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed [11].
