I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. CHOA EK YONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21738, March 1, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
In 1959, Choa Ek Yong filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Manila [1, 2]. He averred in his petition that he earned an average annual income of P3,600.00 to support himself, his wife, and their three children [2]. On December 3, 1960, the lower court rendered a judgment declaring him eligible for Philippine citizenship [3]. After the lapse of the two-year statutory period, the court issued an order on April 18, 1963, allowing the petitioner to take the prescribed oath [3]. The Republic of the Philippines appealed this order, challenging the petitioner's qualifications [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner possesses the required lucrative income to qualify for naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision on the ground that the petitioner lacked the required lucrative income. The Court held that income "is to be reckoned as of the time of the filing of the application," citing *Ty Eng Hua vs. Republic* [2]. At the time of his 1959 petition, Choa Ek Yong's annual income was P3,600.00 for a family of five. Relying on *Law Tai vs. Republic*, the Court ruled that this amount is insufficient to meet the lucrative income requirement, thereby disqualifying him from citizenship [2].

Accordingly, the order allowing the oath-taking is **REVERSED**, the application for naturalization is **DISMISSED**, and the petition to take the oath is **DENIED** [4].
