I. CAPTION
A. M. RAYMUNDO & CO. v. BENI SYMACO, G.R. No. L-22145, January 30, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On June 28, 1957, A. M. Raymundo & Co. (petitioner) filed a complaint for forcible entry against Beni Symaco (respondent) in the Justice of the Peace Court of Malabon, alleging that Symaco unlawfully entered a portion of their land covered by TCT No. 39853 [1]. Symaco answered that he was the owner of the disputed portion, having purchased it from the petitioner itself, as evidenced by TCT No. 3560, and argued that the court lacked jurisdiction as the issue was ownership [2].

The Justice of the Peace Court dismissed the case, finding the issue was ownership, not mere possession [2]. Petitioner appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal. The CFI found that the evidence, including a relocation survey, showed the issue of ownership was necessarily involved [3, 4]. The CFI issued an order stating it would only hear the case under its original jurisdiction if the parties agreed; otherwise, the appeal would be dismissed [5]. Petitioner refused to submit to the CFI's original jurisdiction and appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the forcible entry case by the lower courts was proper given that the issue involved was ownership.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal [7]. The Court ruled that the proceedings clearly showed the true question between the parties was ownership [6]. Under the rules, when the issue in a forcible entry case is ownership and not merely possession, the municipal court (Justice of the Peace) has no jurisdiction. Consequently, when the case is appealed to the CFI, if the municipal court had no jurisdiction, the CFI generally has no appellate jurisdiction to decide the case on the merits. The CFI can only assume original jurisdiction if the parties agree to such a procedure [5, 8, 9]. Since the petitioner did not agree to submit the controversy to the CFI's original jurisdiction, the dismissal of the appeal was correct [6].

**Order affirmed.**
