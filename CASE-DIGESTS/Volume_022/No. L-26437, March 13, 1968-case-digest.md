I. CAPTION
RAQUEL G. DOCE v. BRANCH II OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF QUEZON, THE PROVINCIAL FISCAL OF QUEZON and ARACELI TORRECHANTE, G.R. No. L-26437, March 13, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Raquel Doce was charged with libel. A Municipal Judge issued a warrant for her arrest based only on affidavits sworn before a different judge, without personally examining the witnesses with searching questions. Doce posted bail and appeared before the court to request postponements. However, she failed to appear at the scheduled preliminary investigation. Consequently, the municipal court ruled that she had waived her right to the investigation, found a *prima facie* case against her, and forwarded the records to the Court of First Instance (CFI). The Provincial Fiscal filed an information for libel. Doce filed a motion to quash, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction due to the defective warrant and that she was denied a preliminary investigation. The CFI denied the motion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the court acquired jurisdiction over the petitioner despite the irregular issuance of the warrant of arrest.
2. W/N the petitioner waived her right to a preliminary investigation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Although the Supreme Court found merit in the assertion that the warrant was irregularly issued—as the issuing judge failed to personally examine witnesses with searching questions as required by Section 87 of the Judiciary Act—the petitioner waived this irregularity. The Court held that the posting of a bail bond constitutes a waiver of the irregularity attending the issuance of a warrant of arrest. Furthermore, her personal appearances before the court signified a voluntary submission to its jurisdiction [1], [2].

2. **YES.** The petitioner's failure to appear at the preliminary investigation despite due notice constituted a waiver of said right. The Court presumed the case was called as scheduled, and her absence justified the municipal court's finding of a waiver. Since the municipal judge had already found a *prima facie* case, the Provincial Fiscal was not required to conduct a separate preliminary investigation under Section 14, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court [3], [4].

The petition is dismissed [4].
