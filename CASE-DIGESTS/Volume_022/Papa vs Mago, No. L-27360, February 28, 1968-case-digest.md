I. CAPTION
HON. RICARDO G. PAPA, as Chief of Police of Manila, et al. v. REMEDIOS MAGO and HON. HILARION U. JARENCIO, G.R. No. L-27360, February 28, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On November 4, 1966, Petitioner Martin Alagao, a Manila Police officer acting on orders of Chief of Police Ricardo Papa (who was deputized by the Commissioner of Customs), intercepted two trucks at the Agrifina Circle, Manila. The trucks contained nine bales of foreign merchandise allegedly misdeclared and undervalued [1]. Respondent Remedios Mago claimed ownership of the goods, presenting proof of payment of duties on an "informal entry" [1]. Mago filed a petition for mandamus and injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila (Civil Case No. 67496), presided by Respondent Judge Hilarion Jarencio, arguing that the Bureau of Customs (BOC) lost jurisdiction once the goods left the customs zone and duties were paid. Judge Jarencio issued an order releasing the goods upon the filing of a bond [2]. Petitioners filed the present action for prohibition and certiorari, contending that the BOC retains exclusive jurisdiction over seizure and forfeiture proceedings and that the CFI had no jurisdiction to interfere [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to order the release of the seized goods.
2. W/N the seizure of the goods by police officers without a search warrant was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court of First Instance lacks jurisdiction. The Bureau of Customs acquires exclusive jurisdiction over imported goods for the purposes of enforcement of customs laws from the moment the goods are in its possession or control, to the exclusion of the regular courts [4]. Importation is deemed terminated only upon full payment of duties and the grant of a legal permit for withdrawal (Sec. 1202, Tariff and Customs Code) [5]. Here, duties were not paid in full as the goods were underdeclared and subject to forfeiture [6]. Even if the goods had left the customs area, the BOC regained jurisdiction when they were intercepted by deputized police officers [7]. To permit recourse to the CFI would render the Customs authorities' power ineffective and deprive the Court of Tax Appeals of its exclusive appellate jurisdiction over seizure and forfeiture proceedings (*Pacis v. Averia*; *De Joya v. Lantin*) [8].

2. **YES.** The search and seizure were valid even without a warrant. The Tariff and Customs Code does not require a search warrant for the search and seizure of vehicles, beasts, or persons suspected of holding dutiable articles introduced contrary to law; the requirement for a warrant applies only to the search of a dwelling house (Sec. 2209 vs. Sec. 2211, Tariff and Customs Code) [9]. This distinction rests on the impracticability of securing a warrant for movable vehicles which can be quickly moved out of the jurisdiction (*Carroll v. United States*) [10, 11]. Petitioner Papa, having been deputized by the Commissioner of Customs, had the authority to effect the seizure to enforce customs laws [12].

The petition is **GRANTED**. The order of the respondent Judge is declared **NULL and VOID**, the preliminary injunction is made permanent, and Civil Case No. 67496 is ordered **DISMISSED** [13, 14].
