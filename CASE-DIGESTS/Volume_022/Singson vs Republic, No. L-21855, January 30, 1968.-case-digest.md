I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF ANDRES SINGSON To BE ADMITTED OR TO BE DECLARED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. ANDRES SINGSON, petitioner-appellant, vs. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, oppositor-appellee**, G.R. No. L-21855, January 30, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On October 12, 1959, Andres Singson filed a petition for naturalization with an alternative prayer to be declared a Filipino citizen [1]. On August 9, 1960, the Court of First Instance of La Union rendered a decision granting the alternative prayer, holding that Singson was already a Filipino citizen (born to a Filipino mother and Chinese father, elected citizenship, and exercised suffrage) and thus naturalization was unnecessary [1, 2]. The State did not appeal this decision [3]. However, on December 17, 1962, the Solicitor General filed a petition to set aside the 1960 decision, alleging fraud because Singson had supposedly registered as an alien and executed an affidavit in 1948 renouncing his Filipino citizenship [3, 4]. Singson opposed and denied the genuineness of the affidavit [4, 5]. On July 15, 1963, without receiving evidence on the affidavit's authenticity, the lower court issued an order declaring its 1960 decision null and void [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court erred in setting aside its previous decision declaring the petitioner a Filipino citizen without a hearing on the alleged fraud.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court acknowledged that the lower court’s original 1960 decision was legally erroneous because it relied on the doctrine in *Sy Quiamsuan v. Republic*, which had already been overruled by *Suy Chan v. Republic* [8]. The prevailing rule is that there is no proceeding established by law for the judicial declaration of the citizenship of an individual [8]. However, the Court held that even an erroneous decision acquires finality unless set aside on recognized grounds, such as fraud in its procurement [9]. While the Solicitor General alleged fraud based on the 1948 affidavit, the petitioner expressly denied its execution and truthfulness [5]. The Court ruled that the lower court virtually deprived the petitioner of his day in court when it set aside the original decision based solely on the attached affidavit, without affording the petitioner a chance to present evidence to rebut the allegation of fraud [7].

The order appealed from is set aside, and the case remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [10].
