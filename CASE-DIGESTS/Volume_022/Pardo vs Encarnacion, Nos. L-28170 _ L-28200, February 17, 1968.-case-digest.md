I. CAPTION
CARMEN PARDO DE TAVERA Y LOPEZ MANZANO v. DEMETRIO B. ENCARNACION, et al., G.R. Nos. L-28170 & L-28200, February 17, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pardo de Tavera leased a parcel of land in Quezon City to respondent Encarnacion for a period of 12 years, expiring on February 18, 1966 [1]. The contract stipulated that the lease could be renewed for another eight years upon mutual agreement of terms 30 days prior to expiration [2]. The parties failed to agree on the renewal terms despite negotiations [3, 4]. One day before the lease expired, Encarnacion filed a complaint for specific performance in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cavite to compel the renewal of the lease [5]. Subsequently, Pardo de Tavera filed an unlawful detainer (ejectment) case in the City Court of Quezon City [5]. Encarnacion sought the dismissal of the ejectment case on the ground of *lis pendens* and later secured an order from the CFI of Rizal restraining the Quezon City court from proceeding [5, 6]. The CFI of Cavite also declared itself with jurisdiction over the specific performance case [7]. Petitioner filed the present action to annul these orders and compel the ejectment court to proceed [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the filing of a prior action for specific performance (lease renewal) in the CFI bars the prosecution of a subsequent unlawful detainer suit in the City Court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the right of a lessee to occupy the land as against the demand of the lessor should be decided under Rule 70 of the Rules of Court [8]. Citing *Teodoro v. Mirasol*, the Court ruled that if a plaintiff has any right to the extension of a lease, such right is a proper and legitimate issue that can be raised as a defense in the unlawful detainer case [9]. The matter raised in the CFI of Cavite regarding the renewal may be threshed out in the ejectment suit, in consonance with the principle prohibiting multiplicity of suits [9]. The fact that the unlawful detainer suit was filed later does not bar the dismissal of the action for specific performance or prevent the ejectment case from proceeding, as the Rules do not require a pending *prior* action as a ground for dismissal, only a pending action [10].

Petition granted; writs of certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus made permanent.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
