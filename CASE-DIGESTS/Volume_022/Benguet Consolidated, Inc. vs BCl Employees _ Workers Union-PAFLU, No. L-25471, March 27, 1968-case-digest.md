I. CAPTION
BENGUET CONSOLIDATED, INC., ET AL. v. BCI EMPLOYEES & WORKERS UNION-PAFLU, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25471, March 27, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Donaciano Andrada, an employee of Benguet Consolidated, Inc. and member of the BCI Employees & Workers Union-PAFLU, filed an unfair labor practice (ULP) charge against the company in 1963 [1]. Andrada alleged discrimination regarding his status and employment conditions in violation of Republic Act 875 [1]. Since 1954, despite promotions and transfers to positions with higher pay scales (such as replacing a "bodeguero" earning P4.60/day), the company refused to adjust his salary of P3.24/day, unlike other employees who received adjustments [2-4]. Company officials, specifically Stanley Willimont and Eugene Kneebone, made statements to Andrada implying that his failure to receive raises was due to his "militant" union activities and his act of seeking union help for his grievances [5, 6].

The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found the petitioners guilty of ULP and ordered the implementation of the proper salary scale for Andrada [7, 8]. Petitioners appealed, arguing they were being held liable for 1954 acts based on 1958 union activities, and that the claim was barred by laches [4, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioners committed unfair labor practice by discriminating against Andrada due to his union activities.
2. W/N the respondent's claim is barred by laches.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioners committed unfair labor practice. The discrimination was not limited to 1954 but consisted of continuing acts of refusal to implement the proper salary scale from 1954 through 1962 [4]. The Court clarified that the "militant union activity" involved was Andrada's act of seeking union help to pursue his right to a salary adjustment [10]. Seeking a union's assistance regarding correct wages constitutes proper union activity [10]. Furthermore, the damaging anti-union statements imputed to company officials Willimont and Kneebone were never denied or controverted by the petitioners [10].

2. **NO.** The claim is not barred by laches. The discrimination complained of was continuing in nature from 1954 to 1962 [9]. Additionally, the ULP charge was filed only in 1963 because the complaint was first processed through a series of conciliation meetings between the union and the company [9].

The petition is DENIED. The judgment of the Court of Industrial Relations is AFFIRMED, and the preliminary injunction is revoked and set aside [11].
