I. CAPTION
DATU MARIGA DIRAMPATEN v. HON. HADJI MADKI ALONTO, et al., G.R. No. L-25052, March 15, 1968, Castro, J. [1-3]

II. FACTS
On September 28, 1965, respondent Governor Alonto of Lanao del Sur issued Administrative Order No. 2 suspending petitioner Dirampaten, the Mayor of Taraka, pending an investigation into charges of oppression, corruption, and maladministration. [3] Governor Alonto designated respondent Vice-Mayor Sumpingan as acting mayor. [3] On October 4, 1965, Dirampaten filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus with the Supreme Court to annul the order and enjoin the substitution, arguing grave abuse of discretion. [4, 5] The Court issued a preliminary mandatory injunction on October 6, 1965. [6] However, during the pendency of the case, the general elections of November 14, 1967 took place. [7] Petitioner was re-elected as Mayor, while respondents Alonto and Sumpingan did not seek re-election and ceased to hold their respective offices. [7, 8] Petitioner subsequently filed a motion to withdraw the petition. [7]

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition has been rendered moot and academic by the results of the 1967 elections. [7, 9]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the supervening circumstance of the 1967 elections rendered the petition moot and academic for all practical purposes. [9] The Commission on Elections certified that the principal respondents, Alonto and Sumpingan, ceased to hold their positions as Governor and Vice-Mayor, respectively. [9] Consequently, Alonto could no longer be bound by a decision in the case, and the threat of Sumpingan assuming the mayoralty vanished upon the expiration of his term. [9, 10] The Court reasoned that resolving the petition would serve no useful purpose given the change in the parties' status. [10]

The petitioner's motion withdrawing the present petition is granted. [11]
