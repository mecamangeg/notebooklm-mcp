I. CAPTION
THE INSULAR LIFE ASSURANCE CO., LTD. v. SOCIAL SECURITY COMMISSION and RAMON GAVIOLA, JR., G.R. No. L-23565, March 21, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On November 6, 1960, respondent SSS Administrator Ramon Gaviola, Jr. issued Circular No. 34, declaring that insurance agents and underwriters are employees of insurance firms subject to compulsory Social Security System (SSS) coverage [1, 2]. Petitioner Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. contested this, claiming its agents were not employees, and filed a petition for declaratory relief with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to declare the circular null and void [3]. The CFI dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that the petition deprived the Social Security Commission (SSC) of its statutory power to decide the dispute and bypassed the appeal procedure mandated by law [4]. Petitioner appealed, arguing the SSC’s jurisdiction was limited to money claims [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over a petition for declaratory relief regarding the validity of an SSS circular.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the CFI correctly dismissed the petition. Under Section 5(a) of the Social Security Act, as amended by R.A. No. 2658, the Social Security Commission is vested with the power to pass upon "any disputed matter" having a bearing on the application of the Act, and this jurisdiction is not limited to money claims [6]. Furthermore, Section 5(b) mandates that judicial review is permitted only after the aggrieved party has exhausted remedies before the Commission [7].

The Court ruled that allowing a petition for declaratory relief would circumvent the specific statutory appeal process and practically strip the Commission of its semi-judicial powers [8]. Citing *Philippine American Life Insurance Co. v. Social Security Commission*, the Court emphasized that the issue was not ripe for judicial determination because the controversy had not yet been submitted to and resolved by the Commission [9, 10]. Additionally, the declaratory judgment sought would necessarily affect other insurance companies not impleaded in the case [11].

Decision affirmed [12].
