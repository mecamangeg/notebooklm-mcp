I. CAPTION
CORNELIO AGUILA and LUCIANA ARROYO-AGUILA v. J. M. TUASON & CO., INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-24223, February 22, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On April 2, 1958, J. M. Tuason & Co., Inc. (Tuason) filed Civil Case No. Q-4275 to recover possession of a 1,000-square-meter lot in Quezon City from Cornelio Aguila. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of Tuason, basing its ruling on Tuason's Torrens title, and ordered Aguila to vacate [1]. Aguila failed to appeal on time, and the judgment became final and executory [2].

On February 10, 1964, Aguila and his wife filed Civil Case No. Q-7801 against Tuason, seeking the annulment of the judgment in the previous case, a declaration of their preferential right to purchase the land under a compromise agreement, and reconveyance of the property [3]. Tuason moved to dismiss on the ground of *res judicata* [4]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissed the complaint [4, 5]. Aguila appealed, arguing that the possessory action (Q-4275) was not *res judicata* to the action for ownership and reconveyance (Q-7801) [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the present action for reconveyance and annulment of judgment is barred by *res judicata* due to the prior judgment in the action for recovery of possession.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the action is barred by the final judgment in Civil Case No. Q-4275. Under Section 49(b), Revised Rule 39, a final judgment is conclusive not only on matters directly adjudicated but also as to any other matter that could have been raised in relation thereto [7].

If the petitioners truly had a preferential right to purchase or if Tuason's title was void, these facts constituted a defense to the claim for possession and should have been pleaded in the previous case [8]. Furthermore, the preferential right to purchase claimed by petitioners was in the nature of a compulsory counterclaim in the possessory action; failure to set it up resulted in a waiver [9]. A change in the form of action from recovery of possession to reconveyance does not remove the case from the application of *res judicata*, especially since the right to possession in the first case was predicated on the court's recognition of Tuason's ownership [7]. The policy against multiplicity of suits (*non bis in idem*) prevents relitigation of settled issues [10].

Decision affirmed [11].
