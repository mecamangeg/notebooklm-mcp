I. CAPTION
EUFEMIA V. SHAFFER v. VIRGINIA G. PALMA and BONIFACIO PALMA, G.R. No. L-24115, March 1, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Eufemia Shaffer and her late partner, Nicolas Lynevitche, borrowed P32,000 from defendants Virginia and Bonifacio Palma. To secure the debt, Lynevitche pledged 175 shares of stock and assigned his P300,000 insurance policy to Shaffer and Virginia Palma as beneficiaries [1, 2]. After Lynevitche died, the insurance proceeds were paid. Bonifacio Palma requested Shaffer to issue a check for P150,000 from the proceeds, promising to return the excess after deducting the P32,000 debt [2]. Shaffer issued the check, but defendants refused to return the P118,000 balance or the 175 shares [2].

Shaffer filed a complaint which the Court of First Instance dismissed for lack of cause of action [3]. She then filed an amended complaint clarifying that Virginia Palma was included as an assignee solely for security and that the shares had been endorsed to Shaffer [4]. The lower court admitted the amended complaint but immediately dismissed it again, ruling that the amendments improperly altered the theory of the case and that the agreement to return the money was unenforceable under Article 1358 of the Civil Code because it was not in writing [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the amended complaint states a cause of action.
2. W/N the amendments constituted a new cause of action.
3. W/N the agreement to return the funds is unenforceable because it is not in writing.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** In a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, the defendant is deemed to hypothetically admit the facts alleged in the complaint [7, 8]. The amended complaint sufficiently alleges that Shaffer has an interest to protect—specifically the return of the P118,000 excess and the shares she owns [9]. Based on these allegations, she has the legal capacity to sue and a valid cause of action [8].

2. **NO.** An amendment does not state a new cause of action if the defendant is not required to answer for a wholly different liability and the subject of the controversy remains the same [10, 11]. The amendments here merely amplified and clarified the original claim that the assignment was for security; the liability sought to be enforced (return of the money and shares) remained identical [11, 12]. Courts must be liberal in allowing amendments to determine the actual merits without technicalities [13].

3. **NO.** Contracts are binding upon parties in whatever form they may have been entered into, unless the law specifically requires a form for validity [14, 15]. Article 1358, which requires contracts involving more than P500 to be in writing, is required merely for convenience and is not necessary for validity or enforceability [15, 16]. Thus, the agreement is enforceable even if oral.

The orders are SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED to the lower court for further proceedings [17].
