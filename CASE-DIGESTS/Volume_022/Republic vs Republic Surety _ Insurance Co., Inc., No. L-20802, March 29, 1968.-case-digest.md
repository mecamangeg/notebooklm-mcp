I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. REPUBLIC SURETY & INSURANCE CO., INC., G.R. No. L-20802, March 29, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Go Siu Gui, a Chinese citizen, was ordered deported by the Commissioner of Immigration on June 9, 1950 [1]. Despite this existing deportation order, respondent Republic Surety & Insurance Co., Inc. posted a P7,000.00 bond on November 24, 1950, for his "temporary admission" [2]. Nine years later, the Commissioner demanded the surrender of Go Siu Gui. When the surety failed to produce him within the given period, the Commissioner confiscated the bond and the Republic filed a suit for recovery of the amount in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [2].

During the pendency of the case, the Acting Commissioner of Immigration issued an order declaring the bond void *ab initio* and cancelled it, reasoning that the law does not authorize accepting bonds for persons already ordered deported [2, 3]. Consequently, the CFI dismissed the complaint [4]. The Republic appealed, arguing that the Acting Commissioner's cancellation of the bond was invalid without the approval of the Secretary of Justice [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the surety bond posted for the temporary stay of an alien who had already been ordered deported is valid and enforceable.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that Section 40(a) of the Immigration Law of 1940 does not authorize the Commissioner of Immigration to accept a bond for the temporary liberty of a person already ordered deported [3]. Therefore, the bond posted by the respondent was null and void *ab initio* [3].

The Court further explained that the terms of the bond negated the Republic's assertion that it was intended to secure release pending deportation [5]. The bond conditioned liability on whether the principal "is found deportable," a condition that was useless because the principal's deportation was already a closed matter when the bond was filed [6, 7]. Finally, the Court rejected the Republic's argument regarding the necessity of the Secretary of Justice's approval, holding that Section 3 of the Immigration Act applies to general rules and forms, not to isolated acts or decisions of the Commissioner in individual cases [4].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [8].
