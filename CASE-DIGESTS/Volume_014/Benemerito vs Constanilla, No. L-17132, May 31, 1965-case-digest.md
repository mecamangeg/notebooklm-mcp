I. CAPTION
JUAN BENEMERITO and SOLOMON BENEMERITO v. PETRONILA CONSTANILLA, JULITA DE RABOY and MARCIAL UGBINAR, Justice of the Peace of Badian, Cebu, G.R. No. L-17132, May 31, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Petronila Constanilla and Julita de Raboy filed a forcible entry case against petitioners Juan and Solomon Benemerito in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Badian, Cebu. On February 5, 1951, the JP Court rendered judgment ordering petitioners to vacate the land and pay monthly rents [1]. Petitioners appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu. While the appeal was pending, the parties entered into an amicable settlement and filed a joint motion to dismiss the appeal [2]. On July 20, 1956, the CFI dismissed the appeal and remanded the case to the JP Court for the execution of judgment [2].

Petitioners later opposed the execution, claiming the amicable settlement allowed them to remain in possession [3]. They filed a petition for certiorari in the CFI to annul the writ of execution issued by the JP Court, but the CFI denied the petition [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Justice of the Peace Court committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the writ of execution despite the alleged terms of the amicable settlement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal of the appeal in the CFI, pursuant to the joint motion, revived the judgment appealed from under **Section 9, Rule 40 of the Revised Rules of Court** [5]. The effect was as though no appeal had been perfected; thus, execution should issue as a matter of right under **Section 1, Rule 39** [5].

The JP Court’s duty to execute the order of the CFI was ministerial [5]. The petitioners' remedy, if they claimed the judgment was modified by the settlement, was to move for the reconsideration and modification of the CFI's dismissal order to reflect the true agreement [3]. Since they failed to do so, the order became final, and the JP Court had no discretion but to issue the writ of execution [3].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [6].
