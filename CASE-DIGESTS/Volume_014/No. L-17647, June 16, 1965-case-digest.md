I. CAPTION
HERMINIA GODUCO v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and MARIA B. CASTRO, G.R. No. L-17647, June 16, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Herminia Goduco sought a commission for the sale of land. The Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeals (CA) ruled against her. On February 28, 1964, the Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision [1]. Goduco filed a first Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied. Subsequently, she filed a Second Motion for Reconsideration and/or New Trial based on "newly discovered evidence"—specifically, a receipt allegedly thumb-marked by the land owner acknowledging payment from respondent Maria B. Castro [1], [2]. Meanwhile, during the pendency of this motion, it was manifested that Goduco had already filed a motion in the intestate proceedings of the now-deceased Castro (Sp. Proc. No. 52975) for the recognition of her money claim, which the probate court admitted [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court can entertain a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence after it has affirmed the CA's decision.
2. W/N the motion has become moot and academic.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the judgment of the Court of Appeals is conclusive as to the facts and cannot be reviewed by the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to entertain a motion for new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence, as such motions involve only questions of fact [4], [5].

2. **YES.** The Court found that Goduco had already presented her money claim against the estate of Castro in the settlement proceedings (Sp. Proc. No. 52975), and the probate court had admitted said claim. This development, along with a separate reconveyance case filed by the estate, rendered the issues raised in the motion for reconsideration and/or new trial moot and academic [6], [3], [7].

The Second Motion for Reconsideration and/or New Trial is DENIED [5], [8].
