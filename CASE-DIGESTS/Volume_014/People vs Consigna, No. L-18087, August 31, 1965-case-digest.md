I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PABLO A. CONSIGNA, G.R. No. L-18087, August 31, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Pablo A. Consigna, a Property Clerk, was charged with malversation for misappropriating 860 G.I. corrugated sheets [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance of Surigao acquitted him for "absolute lack of evidence" and ordered his reinstatement [3]. The Provincial Fiscal moved for reconsideration, citing a Commissioner of Civil Service decision that had found Consigna guilty of gross negligence on the same facts and ordered his removal [4]. The trial court modified its decision to eliminate the payment of salaries but maintained the order for reinstatement [4]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that under *People v. Daleon*, the trial court lacked authority to order reinstatement and that the administrative decision should prevail [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court has the authority to order the reinstatement of a public officer acquitted of malversation.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision. The Court distinguished this case from *People v. Daleon*, clarifying that while a court cannot order the payment of salaries upon acquittal (as that right is not involved in the criminal case), the right to reinstatement is involved [6]. Conviction for malversation necessarily results in the denial of the right to office due to the penalty of disqualification provided in Article 117 of the Revised Penal Code [6, 7]. Therefore, if loss of office is the inevitable result of conviction, reinstatement must follow acquittal [6]. Furthermore, the acquittal for "absolute lack of evidence" of willful malversation impliedly acquitted Consigna of malversation through negligence, and the administrative decision of the Civil Service Commissioner is not binding on the courts [8, 9].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [10].
