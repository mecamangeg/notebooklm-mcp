I. CAPTION
YU TI alias VICENTE YUTE alias KANGA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19913, June 23, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Yu Ti, born in China in 1907, arrived in Manila in 1920. He resided in Manila for two years, then Cortez, Bohol for 11 years, and finally Ozamis City since 1933. On August 30, 1960, he filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental. He did not file a declaration of intention, claiming exemption based on his 30-year continuous residence. At the time of filing, his wife and two children (born in 1929 and 1935) were residing in China. Additionally, his petition failed to include a Certificate of Arrival, attaching instead an Immigrant Certificate of Residence, and failed to state his former residence in Manila. His reported income was P2,400.00 per annum. The trial court granted his petition. The Republic appealed, arguing failure to file a declaration of intention, failure to submit the certificate of arrival, failure to list all former residences, and lack of lucrative income.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a declaration of intention despite his children being of majority age and residing abroad.
2. W/N the failure to attach the Certificate of Arrival to the petition is fatal.
3. W/N the failure to state all former places of residence in the petition can be cured by evidence during trial.
4. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 6 of the Revised Naturalization Law, to be exempt from filing a declaration of intention, an applicant must enroll *all* his children in approved schools in the Philippines. The Court ruled that this requirement applies to all children, not just minors. The fact that the children were in China and reached majority age before the petition was filed does not dispense with this requirement [1, 2].

2. **YES.** Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law mandates that the Certificate of Arrival be made part of the petition. This requirement is mandatory and the failure to comply is fatal. The substitution of an Immigrant Certificate of Residence is not a valid excuse, nor was there proof that the original landing certificate records were destroyed or lost [3].

3. **NO.** Section 7 requires the petition to state *all* former places of residence to allow the public and investigating authorities to voice objections. The omission of such facts deprives the government of this opportunity, and the defect cannot be cured by merely proving the residence later during the trial [4].

4. **NO.** Financial capacity is determined as of the time of filing the petition. An annual income of P2,400.00 for a married man with two children is not considered lucrative. The Court noted that even an income of P6,300.00 for a married man with one child has been deemed insufficient in prior cases [5].

**WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed, and the petition denied, with costs against appellee.**
