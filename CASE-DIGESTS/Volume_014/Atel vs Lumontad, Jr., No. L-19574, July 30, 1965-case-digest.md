I. CAPTION
DONATO M. ATEL v. EMILIO LUMONTAD, JR., ET AL., G.R. No. L-19574, July 30, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Jose Lesigues, the Chief of Police of Pinamungajan, Cebu, was administratively charged in 1952 by the then-Mayor with falsification, neglect of duty, and other offenses. The charges were investigated by a "police committee" created by the Municipal Council, not the Council itself. Based on the committee's recommendation, the Council dismissed Lesigues. Lesigues appealed to the Civil Service Commission (CSC), which initially directed the Council to conduct a reinvestigation because, under Republic Act No. 557, investigations must be done by the Council itself. However, the Council claimed the records were lost and did not reinvestigate. The CSC then rendered a decision finding Lesigues guilty based on the original records.

Consequently, Donato Atel was appointed as the new Chief of Police. Years later, in 1960, a new Mayor, Emilio Lumontad, Jr., reinstated Lesigues, causing Atel to turn over the office. Atel filed a petition for *mandamus* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu to declare Lesigues' reinstatement illegal. The CFI granted the petition, ruling that the CSC decision dismissing Lesigues had become final because Lesigues failed to appeal it to the Civil Service Board of Appeals. Lesigues appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the administrative investigation of a police officer conducted by a "police committee" instead of the Municipal Council is valid under Republic Act No. 557.
2. W/N the failure of the respondent to appeal the Civil Service Commission's decision to the Civil Service Board of Appeals validated the dismissal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 1 of Republic Act No. 557, it is mandatory that charges against a member of the municipal police force be investigated by the municipal council itself in a public hearing. An investigation conducted by a mere police committee is null and void *ab initio*. The Court cited established jurisprudence, specifically *Senarillos v. Hermosisima* and *Festejo v. Mayor of Nabua*, holding that RA 557 eliminated the provision authorizing investigations by committees. Therefore, the proceedings against Lesigues were illegal for lack of jurisdiction.

2. **NO.** The fact that Lesigues did not appeal the decision to the Civil Service Board of Appeals is "of no moment." A decision by the Civil Service Commission based on an invalid investigation by a police committee is void. As held in *Salcedo v. The Municipal Council of Candelaria*, an invalid proceeding cannot be validated by a subsequent reaffirmation by Civil Service authorities or by the respondent's failure to appeal.

**The decision appealed from is REVERSED.**
