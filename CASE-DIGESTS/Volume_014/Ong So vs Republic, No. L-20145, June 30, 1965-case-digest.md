I. CAPTION
ONG SO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20145, June 30, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On January 27, 1960, the Court of First Instance of Manila granted Ong So’s petition for naturalization without opposition. Two years later, prior to Ong So's oath-taking, the Republic filed an opposition arguing that Ong So failed to enroll all his children in qualified Philippine schools and lacked a lucrative income [1, 2]. The record showed that two of his sons, born in 1948 and 1949, were residing in Hong Kong and had not been enrolled in Philippine schools [3]. Furthermore, Ong So’s income tax returns for 1959 showed an annual salary of P4,800 to support a wife and five children, though he claimed additional free board and lodging [4]. Despite the opposition, the lower court allowed Ong So to take his oath of allegiance [2]. The government appealed the order [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Ong So complied with the legal requirement regarding the enrollment of his minor children in Philippine schools.
2. W/N Ong So possessed a lucrative trade, profession, or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The enrollment of minor children in Philippine schools is a matter of strict compliance, intended to ensure they absorb Filipino customs, traditions, and ideals during their formative years [6]. Ong So’s sons were not enrolled in Philippine schools upon attaining school age. The Court held that neither the strictness of immigration laws nor the unsettled conditions in China (or Hong Kong) are valid excuses for non-compliance (*Republic v. Go Bon Lee*) [7].

2. **NO.** An annual income of P4,800 is insufficient to support a wife and five children (*Keng Giok v. Republic*) [4]. Even if free board and lodging were considered, the income remains inadequate. Furthermore, later augmentations from bonuses and commissions cannot be counted because an applicant's qualifications are determined as of the time of the application (1959), and contingent income like commissions does not constitute dependable remuneration (*Yu Kian Chie v. Republic*) [8].

The order allowing the oath-taking, the oath administered, and the certificate of citizenship are declared **NULL AND VOID** [9].
