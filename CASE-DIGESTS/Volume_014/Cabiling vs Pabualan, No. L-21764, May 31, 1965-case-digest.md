I. CAPTION
VICENTE CABILING, ET AL. v. EUSEBIO PABUALAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21764 (consolidated with G.R. No. L-21765), May 31, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were designated by President Garcia as "Acting" Mayor, Vice-Mayor, and Councilors of the newly created municipalities of Valencia and Dangcagan, Bukidnon, between 1960 and 1961. On December 18, 1961, instructions were given to convert these designations into "ad interim" appointments, which President Garcia signed on December 25, 1961, and forwarded to the Commission on Appointments (COA) on December 26, 1961. However, on December 31, 1961, incoming President Macapagal issued Administrative Order No. 2, withdrawing and cancelling all ad interim appointments released after December 13, 1961. In June 1962, President Macapagal extended new acting appointments to Respondents Pabualan, et al., who subsequently qualified. The COA confirmed Petitioners' appointments in May 1962. Petitioners filed petitions for quo warranto in the Court of First Instance of Bukidnon. The trial court ruled in favor of Petitioners, holding that appointments under Section 10 of R.A. 180 are necessarily permanent until the next election. Respondents appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the "acting" appointments extended to Petitioners were permanent in nature, prohibiting their removal without cause.
2. W/N the "ad interim" appointments extended to Petitioners were valid and effective.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The power to appoint vested in the Chief Executive generally includes the power to make temporary appointments, unless specifically prohibited by law or repugnant to the nature of the office. There is no law or public policy requiring that vacancies in newly created municipalities under Section 10 of R.A. 180 be filled by permanent appointees; the law merely gives the President discretion to fill the offices. Furthermore, having accepted "acting" appointments without protest for a considerable time, Petitioners are estopped from claiming such appointments were permanent.

2. **NO.** The ad interim appointments were signed on December 25, 1961, and forwarded to the COA on December 26, 1961. They fall squarely within the ban on "midnight appointments" established in *Aytona v. Castillo*. Additionally, the preponderance of evidence showed these appointments were never released before President Macapagal withdrew them via Administrative Order No. 2. Consequently, the confirmation by the Commission on Appointments of these unreleased appointments is of no legal effect.

The decisions appealed from are **REVERSED**, and the petitions for quo warranto are **DISMISSED**.
