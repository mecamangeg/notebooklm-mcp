**I. CAPTION**
PHILIPPINE FARMING CORPORATION, LTD. v. ALEJANDRO LLANOS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21014, August 14, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
On July 11, 1950, Philippine Farming Corporation, Ltd. (Hawaii) executed a sale of a parcel of land in Malabon, Rizal to Manuel Ramos, Dominador Llanos, and Juliana Andrada. Subsequently, the petitioner, Philippine Farming Corporation, Ltd. (Philippines), filed Civil Case No. 1209 in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to annul the sale and cancel the buyers' title [1, 2]. On September 29, 1950, the petitioner moved to dismiss the complaint citing a settlement, which the defendants concurred with; the court granted the dismissal [3].

Years later, after a second suit (Civil Case No. 1439) was dismissed for *res judicata*, the petitioner filed the present suit (Civil Case No. 6322) in 1960. This suit sought to annul the same sale and a subsequent mortgage and foreclosure, impleading the original defendants and their successors-in-interest (mortgagees and redemption purchasers) [4]. The defendants moved to dismiss on the ground of *res judicata*. The CFI dismissed the complaint, prompting this appeal [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the present action is barred by *res judicata*.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court held that all requisites for *res judicata* are present: (1) a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) a final judgment or order on the merits; and (3) identities of parties, subject matter, and cause of action [5].

The dismissal of the first case (Civil Case No. 1209) was a final order on the merits. Because the dismissal was secured by a court order at the instance of both parties based on an alleged settlement, it constituted a dismissal with prejudice under Section 4, Rule 30 of the Old Rules of Court [6]. Regarding the identity of parties, the additional defendants in the present case were merely successors-in-interest and purchasers by title subsequent to the first action; thus, they are bound by the previous judgment [7]. The subject matter and cause of action were also identical, as the same evidence—proof of plaintiff's ownership and the fictitious nature of the sale—would support both the former and present causes of action [8].

The order appealed from is affirmed [9].
