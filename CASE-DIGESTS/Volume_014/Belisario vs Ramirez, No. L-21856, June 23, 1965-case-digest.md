I. CAPTION
BENJAMIN BELISARIO v. MARCELO RAMIREZ, G.R. No. L-21856, June 23, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Benjamin Belisario and respondent Marcelo Ramirez contested the position of Municipal Secretary of Valencia, Bukidnon via a *quo warranto* proceeding [1]. Belisario was appointed by Mayor Teodoro Pepito, while Ramirez was appointed by Mayor Lucilo Alkuino [1]. The case was tried jointly in the lower court with *Pepito v. Alkuino* (G.R. No. L-21765), which involved the validity of the mayoral appointments [1]. The parties stipulated that the decision in the present case would depend entirely on the outcome of the mayoralty case: if Pepito's appointment as Mayor was sustained, Belisario’s appointment would be valid; otherwise, Ramirez’s appointment would prevail [2, 3]. The lower court ruled in favor of Belisario (implied by his status as appellee) [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appointment of petitioner Belisario as Municipal Secretary is valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the appointment of petitioner Belisario is void, while the appointment of respondent Ramirez is valid [4].

In the related case of *Pepito v. Alkuino* (G.R. No. L-21765), the Court ruled that the *ad interim* appointment of Mayor Pepito was a "midnight appointment" and thus void, pursuant to the doctrine laid down in the *Aytona* case [4]. Since the appointing authority (Pepito) had no valid title to the office of Mayor, his appointment of Belisario as Municipal Secretary was consequently void [4]. Conversely, the appointment made by Mayor Alkuino in favor of Ramirez was declared valid [4].
