I. CAPTION
OLEGARIO BRITO and TAN SOO alias So WA v. THE COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION, G.R. No. L-16829, June 30, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Olegario Brito, a Filipino citizen, married Tan Soo (a Chinese national) in Hong Kong on December 8, 1954 [1]. Upon Tan Soo's arrival in Manila in 1955, the Board of Special Inquiry admitted her as a Philippine citizen [1]. However, in 1957, the Commissioner of Immigration discovered Brito had a prior marriage to one Narcisa Magat in 1943. Consequently, the Commissioner ordered Tan Soo's arrest and deportation, arguing she was not lawfully admissible at the time of entry [2].

Brito and Tan Soo filed a petition for prohibition, mandamus, and injunction with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to stop the deportation [3]. The CFI ruled in their favor, declaring Tan Soo the lawful wife of Brito and enjoining the Commissioner from arresting her [4]. The Commissioner appealed to the Supreme Court. While a separate criminal case for perjury against Brito resulted in his acquittal—finding his first marriage void and his marriage to Tan Soo valid—the Supreme Court focused on the immigration law aspect [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the marriage of an alien woman to a Filipino citizen automatically confers Philippine citizenship upon her.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the marriage of an alien woman to a Philippine citizen does not automatically make her a Philippine citizen entitled to enjoy all the rights and privileges of citizenship [6]. Even assuming the marriage between Brito and Tan Soo was valid, she must still satisfactorily establish in appropriate proceedings that she possesses all the qualifications required by Section 2 and none of the disqualifications enumerated in Section 4 of the Naturalization Act [6].

The Court relied on established jurisprudence (*Lee Chay v. Galang*, *San Tuan v. Galang*, etc.) stating that the privilege of citizenship is not granted indiscriminately solely on the ground of marriage [6]. Since the record did not show that Tan Soo made any attempt to prove she possessed the specific statutory qualifications for naturalization, the lower court's decision preventing the Commissioner from enforcing immigration laws was erroneous [7].

**Decision REVERSED.** [7]
