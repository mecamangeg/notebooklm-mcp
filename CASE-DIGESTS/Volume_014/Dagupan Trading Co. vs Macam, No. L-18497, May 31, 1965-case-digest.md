**I. CAPTION**
DAGUPAN TRADING COMPANY v. RUSTICO MACAM, G.R. No. L-18497, May 31, 1965, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
In 1955, Sammy Maron and his siblings owned a parcel of unregistered land in Pangasinan. While their application for land registration was pending, they sold the property to Respondent Rustico Macam via deeds of sale dated June 19 and September 21, 1955 [1]. Macam immediately took possession and introduced substantial improvements [1]. Subsequently, on October 14, 1955, Original Certificate of Title No. 6942 was issued in the name of the Marons [1].

On August 4, 1956, pursuant to a judgment against Sammy Maron in a separate civil case, a levy was made on his one-eighth share of the property in favor of Manila Trading and Supply Company [2]. The share was sold at a public auction to Manila Trading, and the certificate of sale was duly registered [2]. Manila Trading later transferred its rights to Petitioner Dagupan Trading Company [2]. Petitioner filed an action for partition and damages, which the Court of First Instance dismissed. The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal, holding that Macam had a superior right [3], [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the prior unregistered sale to Macam prevails over the subsequent registered execution sale to Dagupan Trading.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. The Court held that while the registration of a deed of sale is usually the operative act to convey registered land, this rule did not strictly apply because the sale to Macam took place *before* the land was registered, while the execution sale occurred *after* registration [4], [5].

Instead, the Court applied the last paragraph of Section 35, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which provides that a purchaser in an execution sale "shall be substituted to and acquire all the right, title, interest and claim of the judgment debtor to the property as of the time of the levy" [5]. At the time of the levy in 1956, Sammy Maron had no remaining interest in the land, having already conveyed it to Macam in 1955 [5]. Consequently, the levy was void because the judgment debtor had no interest to transfer. The Court emphasized that an unregistered sale and consequent conveyance of ownership cannot be defeated by a subsequent levy where the buyer had already taken possession as owner [5], [6]. The decision appealed from is affirmed [6].
