I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. EUGENIO PASILAN, G.R. No. L-18770, July 30, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On December 14, 1944, in Jones, Isabela, Eugenio Pasilan, a guerrilla, was at the house of Justina Miguel when the victim, Ciriaco Abarra, passed by. Pasilan told Miguel he would make an "exhibition," then ordered Abarra to throw away his bolo. Pasilan questioned Abarra about surrendering a rifle to the Japanese, then slapped and stabbed him twice. Abarra ran away, but his body was later found and buried. Years later, in 1954, an investigation led to Pasilan, who executed an affidavit admitting his presence but blaming a comrade. During the trial, Pasilan repudiated the affidavit, claimed alibi, and sought amnesty. The prosecution witness, Miguel, initially identified Pasilan but later expressed uncertainty. The Court of First Instance of Isabela convicted Pasilan of Murder.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt despite the defense of alibi and witness recantation.
2. W/N the killing was attended by treachery and evident premeditation.
3. W/N the accused is entitled to amnesty.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that alibi is a weak defense, especially when uncorroborated and contradicted by the accused's own affidavit [1]. Regarding the witness's uncertainty, the Court held that not every recantation entitles the accused to a new trial, as this would make the administration of justice dependent on witnesses rather than courts [2]. The initial positive identification and the accused's prior admission were deemed sufficient to establish guilt.

2. **YES.** Treachery was present because Pasilan ordered the victim to throw away his bolo before the attack, ensuring the commission of the crime without risk to himself [3, 4]. Evident premeditation was established by Pasilan's statement to the witness that he would "make an exhibition" and his prior motive regarding the surrendered rifle [5, 6].

3. **NO.** The Court held that amnesty presupposes the commission of a crime. Since the accused maintained a plea of not guilty and denied committing the offense, he cannot avail himself of amnesty [7, 8].

**Disposition:** The motion for new trial is denied and the decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** with the modification that the indemnity is increased to P6,000.00.
