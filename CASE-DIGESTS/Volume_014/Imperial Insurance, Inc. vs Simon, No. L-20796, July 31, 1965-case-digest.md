I. CAPTION
IMPERIAL INSURANCE, INC. v. PELAGIO B. SIMON, G.R. No. L-20796, July 31, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant Pelagio B. Simon leased the ground floor of a building in Manila for his haberdashery shop at a monthly rental of P1,800.00. On September 13, 1961, Plaintiff Imperial Insurance, Inc. purchased the property. Imperial Insurance and the former owner immediately notified Simon of the sale and the termination of his monthly lease, giving him one month to vacate. Simon failed to vacate or pay arrears. Later, Simon offered to pay an increased rental of P2,300.00 if granted a one-year extension, but he failed to pay the accruing rentals for December 1961 to February 1962. Imperial Insurance filed a complaint for Unlawful Detainer in the Municipal Court of Manila. The Municipal Court ordered Simon to vacate and pay P2,300.00 monthly. On appeal, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila rendered a decision applying Article 1687 of the Civil Code *motu proprio*, allowing Simon to occupy the premises for two years at the old rate of P1,800.00, and ordering Imperial Insurance to reimburse Simon P20,000.00 for alleged improvements. Imperial Insurance appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court could apply Article 1687 of the Civil Code to fix a longer lease term despite the lessee failing to raise it as a defense.
2. W/N the lessee is entitled to retain the premises until reimbursed for alleged improvements.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The failure to interpose the provisions of Article 1687 of the Civil Code in the answer as a defense to a complaint for ejectment constitutes a waiver. Consequently, the trial court cannot apply the provision *motu proprio* [1-3]. Furthermore, Article 1687 does not contemplate an unwarranted extension of a lease period to make the contract terms indefinite until judicial intervention [3, 4]. The Court also held that granting a two-year extension was baseless as the lessee only requested one year, and fixing the rental at P1,800.00 was arbitrary given the lessee's expressed willingness to pay P2,300.00 [5-7].

2. **NO.** A lessee is not entitled to retain possession of the leased premises until reimbursed for alleged improvements because a lessee cannot pretend to act in good faith; he knows his occupation is only for the life of the lease [5, 8, 9]. To be entitled to one-half the value of improvements under the Civil Code (Art. 1678), the lessee must show they were introduced in good faith, are useful, and suitable to the use for which the lease is intended [9-11]. Here, Simon failed to prove the existence and value of the improvements as his counterclaim had been dismissed and no evidence was presented during trial [9].

**Disposition:** The decision appealed from is MODIFIED. Defendant-appellee Pelagio B. Simon is ordered to vacate the premises immediately, pay P2,300.00 monthly rentals from December 1961 until he vacates, and pay P1,500.00 attorney's fees. [12]
