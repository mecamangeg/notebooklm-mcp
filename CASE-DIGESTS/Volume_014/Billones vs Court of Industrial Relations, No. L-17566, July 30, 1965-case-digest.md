I. CAPTION
TEOTIMO BILLONES, ET AL. v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and LUZON STEVEDORING CORPORATION, G.R. Nos. L-17566 & L-17567, July 30, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were employees of respondent Luzon Stevedoring Corporation who claimed overtime compensation covering the period from 1948 to 1956. They had previously filed claims with the Wage Administration Service and the Department of Labor, but these were dismissed or withdrawn following amicable settlements and collective bargaining agreements [1-3].

On February 26, 1959 (L-17567) and April 11, 1960 (L-17566), petitioners filed new cases with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) for the same 1948–1956 claims [4]. Respondent moved to dismiss on the ground of prescription, citing Republic Act No. 1993 (enacted June 22, 1957), which amended the Eight-Hour Labor Law to require actions to be commenced within three years from accrual [5, 6]. The CIR dismissed the complaint in L-17566 as barred by prior judgment and prescription [7, 8]. In L-17567, the CIR ruled that only claims prior to three years before filing had prescribed, allowing the rest [9]. Petitioners appealed, arguing R.A. 1993 should not apply retroactively to impair vested rights and that their previous filings interrupted prescription [10, 11].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N R.A. No. 1993 applies retroactively to causes of action that accrued before its enactment.
2. W/N the filing of previous dismissed or withdrawn actions interrupted the prescriptive period.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that R.A. No. 1993 is a limitation statute which the Legislature has the power to pass. The provision stating that "actions already commenced before the effective date of this Act shall not be affected" clearly indicates the legislative intent to apply the law retroactively to actions not yet commenced [12]. While the law shortened the prescriptive period, it did not impair vested rights because claimants were afforded a reasonable time—one year from the law's enactment in 1957—to file their accrued claims. Petitioners failed to sue within this reasonable period, filing only in 1959 and 1960 [13].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the previous presentation of claims with the Department of Labor did not suspend the prescriptive period because those claims were dismissed at the petitioners' instance. A dismissal or voluntary abandonment leaves the parties in exactly the same position as though no action had been commenced at all; thus, it takes no time out of the period of prescription [14].

**Disposition:** The Order in G.R. No. L-17566 is AFFIRMED. The Order in G.R. No. L-17567 is MODIFIED; claims from 1948 to February 25, 1956 are declared prescribed, while the case is REMANDED for the resolution of claims from February 26, 1956 to December 31, 1956 [15].
