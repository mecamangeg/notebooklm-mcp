**I. CAPTION**
NAPOLEON MAGALIT, ET AL. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20448, May 25, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners Napoleon Magalit, et al., employees of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO), filed a complaint for unfair labor practice against respondents Geronimo Quadra, et al. Petitioners alleged that respondents violated the Magna Carta of Labor by joining the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Employees Association, a rank-and-file union, despite holding supervisory positions [1]. Respondents denied the charge, claiming it was an election gimmick [2].

The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) dismissed the complaint, ruling that under the PCSO charter, only the General Manager constitutes a "supervisor" because policy powers are lodged in the Board of Directors and direction/control in the Manager [3]. The CIR *en banc* affirmed this dismissal [4]. Petitioners sought review before the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N respondents are supervisors within the meaning of the Magna Carta of Labor (Republic Act No. 875) and thus disqualified from joining the rank-and-file union.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CIR decision. Under Section 2(k) of Republic Act No. 875, a "supervisor" is any person with authority to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, discharge, assign, recommend, or discipline other employees, or effectively recommend such acts, provided the exercise of authority requires the use of independent judgment and is not merely routinary [4, 5].

The Court relied on the WAPCO Position Description Forms submitted by the respondents. Although prepared by the employees, these forms were approved by Department Heads and the General Manager, making them official indices of their functions [6]. The forms revealed that respondents exercised general supervision over executive assistants and had the power to recommend action on various operational matters requiring independent judgment [7]. Specifically, respondent Quadra's additional assignment as a liaison officer did not strip him of his regular functions as Chief Legal Officer, which are supervisory in nature [8].

Consequently, the respondents were ordered to cease their membership in the respondent union and resign from the union offices to which they had been elected [8].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Barrera, J., took no part).
