I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF TANG KONG KIAT alias LIM SU TONG TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, TANG KONG KIAT alias LIM SU TONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19915, June 23, 1965, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Tang Kong Kiat, a Chinese citizen residing in Ozamis City, filed a petition for naturalization on August 20, 1960. He is the managing partner of Sutong & Co. and claimed an average annual income of P5,000. However, his income tax returns for 1959 and 1960 showed a net income of only P4,200, representing his salary, while the partnership itself incurred losses. He has a wife and four minor children to support. During the proceedings, he failed to include or present his Certificate of Arrival, claiming the Bureau of Immigration took it in exchange for his Immigrant Certificate of Residence. The Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental granted his petition. The Republic appealed, challenging the court's jurisdiction due to lack of posting of notice, the failure to present the Certificate of Arrival, and the sufficiency of petitioner's income.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the petition.
2. W/N the failure to include the Certificate of Arrival in the petition is a fatal defect.
3. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The requirement of posting copies of the petition for naturalization and the notice of hearing in a public and conspicuous place is jurisdictional. The failure to prove compliance with this requirement renders the court without jurisdiction to hear and decide the petition [1].

2. **YES.** Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law expressly requires the inclusion of the Certificate of Arrival as part of the petition. This requirement is mandatory. The petitioner’s excuse that the Bureau of Immigration took the original certificate is invalid; he should have produced a certified true copy. Non-compliance with this requirement is a fatal defect [2, 3].

3. **NO.** Considering the petitioner has a wife and four minor children to support, an annual income of P4,200 (or even conceding P5,000) is not lucrative enough to qualify for Philippine citizenship. The Court relied on *Keng Giok v. Republic* and *Tan v. Republic*, where similar or higher incomes were deemed insufficient for applicants with dependents [4, 5].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition for admission to Philippine citizenship is **DENIED** [6].
