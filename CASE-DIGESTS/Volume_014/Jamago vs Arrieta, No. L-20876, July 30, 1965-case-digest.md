I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO JAMAGO, I. D. CHAN, FERNANDO MAMOWAG and PERFECTO TAGAILO v. HON. ABUNDIO Z. ARRIETA, NICASIO VALLEJOS and CANDIDO LUMANOS, G.R. No. L-20876, July 30, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Vallejos and Lumanos filed a collection suit against petitioners Jamago et al. in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Malaybalay regarding a cockfight wager [1]. The JP Court ruled in favor of respondents [2]. Petitioners filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bukidnon, presided by respondent Judge Arrieta, and paid the P25.00 appeal bond and P20.00 for the docket fee to the JP Court [3]. The CFI received the records and docketed the case as Civil Case No. 191 on September 5, 1960 [3].

Eighteen months later, on March 6, 1962, respondents moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing that petitioners failed to pay the full docket fee of P24.00 (a P4.00 deficiency) [4]. Petitioners opposed, citing substantial compliance, and immediately paid the P4.00 deficiency on April 18, 1962 [4]. Despite the deficiency being cured, the respondent Judge dismissed the appeal on September 18, 1962, and denied the subsequent Motion for Reconsideration [4, 5]. Petitioners filed a petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal was correctly dismissed for failure to pay the full docket fee within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the appeal [7]. The Court found that petitioners substantially complied with the rules. The case had been docketed for 18 months before the shortage was noted, and the deficiency was cured five months before the order of dismissal was issued [7]. The Court ruled that technicalities in procedure should be brushed aside when they run counter to the principle of liberal interpretation of the rules, especially when the delay has been explained and justice so requires [8].

The Orders complained of are set aside, and the respondent Judge is ordered to give due course to the appeal [9].
