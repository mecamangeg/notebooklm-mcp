I. CAPTION
PARKE, DAVIS & COMPANY v. DOCTORS' PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., G.R. No. L-22221, August 31, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Parke, Davis & Co., a foreign corporation, held Letters Patent No. 50 for the chemical *chloramphenicol*, issued on February 9, 1950 [1]. On October 9, 1959, Respondent Doctors' Pharmaceuticals, Inc. requested a voluntary license to use the chemical in its own medicinal preparations [2]. When Petitioner did not grant the request, Respondent filed a petition for a compulsory license with the Director of Patents, invoking the fact that the patent had been in existence for more than three years [2]. Petitioner opposed, arguing that Respondent was not competent, that the invention was not necessary for public health, and that Respondent intended to merely import the chemical rather than "work" (manufacture) the patented invention itself [3]. The Director of Patents granted the compulsory license [4, 5]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a compulsory license may be granted to Respondent under Section 34(d) of Republic Act No. 165 despite Petitioner's objections regarding necessity and the "working" of the patent.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the grant of the license. The Court held that under Section 34(d) of Republic Act No. 165, a compulsory license may be granted after three years if the invention relates to medicine OR is necessary for public health or public safety [6, 7]. These grounds are disjunctive; since *chloramphenicol* is admittedly a medicine, it need not be proven "necessary" for public health, although the Court found it was indeed necessary [8, 9].

Furthermore, the Court ruled that the requirement to "work" the invention (i.e., manufacture it) does not apply to compulsory licenses involving medicine under Section 34(d) [10]. Therefore, Respondent's plan to import the chemical for use in local medicinal preparations is permissible [10]. The Court emphasized that this provision aims to prevent patent monopolies and increase the supply of medicines to the public [11, 12].

Petition denied; Decision affirmed [13].
