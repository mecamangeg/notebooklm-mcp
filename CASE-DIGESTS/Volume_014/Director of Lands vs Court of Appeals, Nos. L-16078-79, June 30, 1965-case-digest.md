I. CAPTION
**THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS and THE MISAMIS LUMBER CO., INC.**, G.R. Nos. L-16078-79, June 30, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
The dispute involves Lot 5308, which the Director of Lands claimed as public land and a portion of which (30 hectares) was awarded to Esteban Villanueva via a sales patent [1, 2]. Respondent Misamis Lumber Co. claimed the lot was private property, relying on a possessory information title registered in 1894 and continuous possession in the concept of an owner since 1887 [1, 3].

The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the trial court, ruling that Misamis Lumber’s title had ripened into ownership and that the land was private; thus, the Bureau of Lands could not validly sell it to Villanueva [2]. The CA adjudicated 371 hectares to Misamis Lumber and dismissed Villanueva's complaint [4, 5]. Both Villanueva (G.R. Nos. L-16076-77) and the Director of Lands (G.R. Nos. L-16078-79) appealed to the Supreme Court [5]. In his brief, the Director of Lands admitted that his appeal was "inextricably linked" with Villanueva’s appeal and that the resolution of his case necessarily hinged on the outcome of Villanueva's case, adopting the latter's statement of facts and arguments [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed given the decision in the related case of *Villanueva* (G.R. Nos. L-16076-77).

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that where the issues raised on appeal are inextricably linked with those of a case already decided by the Supreme Court, and the decision in the latter case has become final and executory, the appeal must be dismissed [7, 8].

The Director of Lands expressly admitted that the questions of law in this case were the same as those in Villanueva's appeal [9]. The Supreme Court had already decided Villanueva's appeal (G.R. Nos. L-16076-77) on November 28, 1964, affirming *in toto* the Court of Appeals' findings that the land was private property [9]. Consequently, the instant appeal was rendered moot by the finality of the linked decision.

**Appeal dismissed.**
