I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF SEE YEK TEK alias SY YAC TIAK TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. SEE YEK TEK alias SY YAC TIAK v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-19898, June 28, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On March 8, 1961, Petitioner See Yek Tek filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Cebu [1]. He claimed exemption from filing a declaration of intention, alleging continuous residence in the Philippines for over 30 years since his arrival in 1927, except for a short visit to China in 1947 [1]. However, during the hearing, it was established that after arriving in 1927, he returned to China in 1930 and studied there until 1938 [2, 3]. Despite this gap, the lower court granted his petition [4]. The Republic appealed, arguing the petitioner failed to file the required declaration of intention and did not meet the 30-year continuous residence requirement for exemption [4, 5]. The petitioner contended that as a minor during his stay in China (1930-1938), he legally followed the residence of his father, who lived in the Philippines [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a declaration of intention based on the 30-year continuous residence requirement despite his physical absence from the country from 1930 to 1938.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner is not exempt from filing a declaration of intention because he failed to establish the required 30-year continuous residence [6].

The Court rejected the petitioner's argument that his residence in China as a minor should be deemed residence in the Philippines following his father [3, 7]. Citing *In re Domingo Dy* and *Sy See vs. Republic*, the Court ruled that the Naturalization Law (Sec. 6, C.A. No. 473) contemplates "actual and substantial residence," not merely legal or constructive residence [7, 8]. The rationale for the 30-year exemption is that a long actual stay presumes the applicant has imbibed Filipino principles and allows the community to observe their conduct—a purpose not served by legal fiction [7]. Since the petitioner was physically in China from 1930 to 1938, his actual residence in the Philippines prior to the 1961 petition was only about 23 years [3]. Consequently, the petition was fatally defective for lack of a declaration of intention [6].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** [9].
