I. CAPTION
AUGUSTO COSIO and BEATRIZ COSIO DE RAMA v. CHERIE PALILEO, G.R. No. L-18452, May 31, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Cherie Palileo secured a loan of P12,000 from petitioner Beatriz Cosio de Rama, executing a document titled "Conditional Sale of Residential Building" for a house on rented land. Palileo remained in the house as a tenant. After a fire partially destroyed the house, petitioner Cosio de Rama received insurance proceeds, and her brother, petitioner Augusto Cosio, entered the premises to repair it, spending P12,000.

In a previous case (*Palileo v. Cosio*), the Supreme Court reformed the contract, declaring it a loan with an equitable mortgage rather than a sale. Consequently, Palileo filed this action to recover possession. The Court of First Instance ruled Cosio de Rama was a possessor in good faith entitled to retention until reimbursed for repairs. The Court of Appeals modified this, declaring petitioners possessors in bad faith (due to the pending litigation challenging their title) and, applying Article 449 on builders in bad faith, ruled they were not entitled to reimbursement.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioners were possessors in bad faith.
2. W/N petitioners are entitled to reimbursement for the repairs made despite being possessors in bad faith.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The petitioners knew from the beginning that the transaction was a loan with an equitable mortgage and not a true sale. Therefore, Cosio de Rama knew she was not entitled to possession or ownership. By instructing her brother to enter and repair the premises, and later occupying it herself, she acted as a possessor in bad faith [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The Court of Appeals erred in applying Article 449 of the Civil Code, which denies indemnity to builders in bad faith. Article 449 is a rule of accession regarding building on another's land. Here, petitioners did not build a new improvement but merely made repairs to a house partially destroyed by fire. This falls under **Article 546** of the Civil Code, which mandates the refund of "necessary expenses" to *every* possessor, including those in bad faith [3, 4].

**Judgment affirmed with modification.** Petitioners are declared possessors in bad faith liable for rent, but Respondent Palileo is ordered to reimburse Petitioner Cosio de Rama the P12,000 spent on necessary expenses [5].
