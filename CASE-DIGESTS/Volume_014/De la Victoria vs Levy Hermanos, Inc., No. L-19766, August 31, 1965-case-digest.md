I. CAPTION
FERMIN DE LA VICTORIA, ET AL. v. LEVY HERMANOS, INC. ET AL., G.R. No. L-19766, August 31, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Juan, Marcelino, Irenea, and Anacleto Ortega were registered owners of Lot No. 121-A in San Carlos, Negros Occidental [1]. In 1934, Anacleto and Marcelino sold their respective shares to petitioners Fermin de la Victoria and his wife. These conveyances were annotated on the certificate of title on February 20, 1936 [2]. The petitioners took possession and constructed buildings on the lot [3].

Subsequently, on August 6, 1936, the Ortegas mortgaged the lot to respondent Levy Hermanos, Inc. to secure a car purchase [4]. In 1939, Levy Hermanos, Inc. instituted foreclosure proceedings against the Ortegas. The petitioners were not impleaded as defendants despite their prior registered interest and actual possession [4]. The property was sold to the Concha spouses, and the lower court declared them owners, ordering the petitioners to vacate [5]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's decision [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the foreclosure sale is valid and binding against the petitioners who held a prior registered interest but were not impleaded.
2. W/N the foreclosure proceedings were null and void for alleged lack of jurisdiction over the mortgagors (the Ortegas).

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the foreclosure sale cannot affect the rights of the petitioners. Under Rule 70, Section 3 of the Rules of Court (now Rule 68), the sale of mortgaged property "shall not affect the rights of persons holding prior incumbrances" [6]. The petitioners had their rights annotated on the title in February 1936, prior to the mortgage execution in August 1936, and were in actual possession acting in good faith [3, 6]. As they were not impleaded in the foreclosure suit, they cannot be deprived of their possession and improvements without due process [6].

2. **NO.** The claim that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the mortgagors is without merit. The mortgagors were properly served with summons and were represented by counsel who confessed judgment in their behalf [7]. Under Section 20, Rule 127, counsel is presumed authorized unless the contrary appears. The mortgagors impliedly confirmed this authority by remaining silent when judgment was confessed in their presence and by failing to dispute it for over ten years [7].

The petition is **GRANTED** in part. The decision is **MODIFIED**, declaring the foreclosure proceedings in Civil Case No. 8176 without effect insofar as the rights, interest, and participation of the petitioners over Lot 121-A and their improvements are concerned [8].
