I. CAPTION
DOLORES C. VDA. DE GIL, administratrix-appellee, v. AGUSTIN CANCIO, claimant-appellant, G.R. No. L-21472, July 30, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Carlos Gil, Sr. died testate, instituting his widow Isabel Herreros as exclusive heir, with adopted son Carlos Gil, Jr. as substitute. Isabel was appointed administratrix. During the Japanese occupation, Isabel and Carlos, Jr. obtained a P89,000 loan from Agustin Cancio for their support, agreeing to transfer two estate lots in Pampanga to him upon adjudication. After Carlos, Jr. died, Isabel moved for authority to transfer the lots, which the probate court approved in 1954, subject to the submission of the deed. Isabel died before executing the deed. Dolores C. Vda. de Gil (Carlos, Jr.'s widow and co-administratrix) subsequently executed the deed and sought its approval in 1956. However, in 1959, when Cancio filed a motion for the final approval of the deed, Dolores opposed it, claiming lack of authority and that the transaction was an equitable mortgage. The probate court denied Cancio's motion and set aside its 1954 order, ruling that the obligation was personal to the heirs and must be enforced in a separate action, not in the probate proceedings.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the probate court has jurisdiction to approve the sale of estate properties executed by prospective heirs before final adjudication.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that it is within the jurisdiction of a probate court to approve the sale of properties of a deceased person by his prospective heirs before final adjudication. Under Article 1430 of the Civil Code, the widow and children are entitled to allowances for support pending liquidation; the loan obtained for their support falls within this purview. Additionally, Section 4, Rule 89 of the Rules of Court authorizes the administrator to sell the estate when beneficial to the heirs. An heir may validly sell their right, interest, or participation in the property under administration, and the approval of such sale properly falls under the probate court's jurisdiction (*Estefania R. Vda. de Cruz v. Ilagan*). The Court also noted that Dolores was estopped from disputing the sale as she had previously sought its approval. Therefore, the lower court erred in ruling that the matter required a separate action.

The order appealed from is **SET ASIDE**, and the motion praying for the approval of the deed of sale is **GRANTED**.
