I. CAPTION
NELITA MORENO VDA. DE BACALING v. GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20124, August 14, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
GSIS obtained a judgment in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo (Civil Case No. 5233) to foreclose a real estate mortgage executed by Dr. Ramon Bacaling and his wife, petitioner Nelita Moreno Vda. de Bacaling. Following the debtors' failure to pay, the Sheriff conducted an auction sale in October 1961, where GSIS was the highest bidder. On October 10, 1961, GSIS filed a motion for confirmation of the sale. Petitioner opposed the motion on October 11, 1961, alleging irregularities and praying for a new auction.

While the motion for confirmation and the opposition were pending, petitioner filed a separate civil action (Civil Case No. 5934) on March 15, 1962, to annul the sale based on the same alleged irregularities. GSIS moved to dismiss this separate action on the ground of *lis pendens* (another action pending between the same parties involving the same issues). The trial court dismissed the separate action. Petitioner appealed, arguing that a judicial sale may be set aside in a separate action citing *Jalandoni v. Ledesma*.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the debtor may maintain a separate independent action to annul a foreclosure sale while a motion to confirm such sale and the debtor's opposition thereto are pending in the foreclosure proceedings.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that a separate action cannot be maintained simultaneously with the pending motion to confirm the sale in the foreclosure proceedings.

While *Jalandoni v. Ledesma* states that a sale may be set aside either via motion or separate action, it does not allow both to proceed at the same time. The rule on *lis pendens* prohibits entertaining another litigation when a case between the same parties involving identical issues is already pending, to avoid multiplicity of suits and judicial confusion. A foreclosure suit is not finished until the approval of the sale (*Salazar v. Torres*). Here, the issues in the separate action—specifically irregularities regarding notice, publication, and price—were identical to those raised in the opposition to the confirmation of sale.

The Court further ruled that the inclusion of the Sheriff as a defendant in the separate action does not avoid the "pending action" rule, as the Sheriff is virtually a party in the foreclosure proceedings (*Aquino v. Securities*).

The appeal is denied and the judgment of dismissal is affirmed.
