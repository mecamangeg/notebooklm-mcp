I. CAPTION
CELESTINO TAN @ CELESTINO L. GUY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20287, July 30, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Celestino Tan, also known as Celestino L. Guy, filed a petition for naturalization before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [2]. He was born in the Philippines to Chinese parents and baptized as Celestino Tan [3]. However, his parents enrolled him in elementary school as "Celestino Guy," using the surname of an ancestor [3]. Petitioner continued to use "Celestino Guy" throughout high school and college, and even registered his children under the surname "Guy" [3, 4]. The CFI granted his petition for naturalization [2]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that the petitioner had not conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during his residence because he used an alias without complying with legal requirements [2, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's unauthorized use of an alias constitutes improper conduct that bars his naturalization.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner failed to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner. While his enrollment in elementary school under a different name by his parents might be overlooked, his continuous use of the name "Guy" in high school, college, and for his children's birth certificates was improper and caused confusion regarding his true identity [4, 5]. The Court ruled that this conduct constitutes a violation of Commonwealth Act No. 142 (Anti-Alias Law), which prohibits the use of an alias without judicial authority [5]. Non-compliance with this law is considered a failure to conduct oneself in a proper and irreproachable manner as required by the Naturalization Law, which is fatal to the application [6, 7].

The decision of the lower court is REVERSED [1].
