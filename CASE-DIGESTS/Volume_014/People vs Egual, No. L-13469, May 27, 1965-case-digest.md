I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PABLO EGUAL, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-13469, L-14240 & L-14209, May 27, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
These are three consolidated appeals from the Court of First Instance of Batangas regarding crimes committed by members of the Hukbalahap organization.

In G.R. No. L-13469, Pablo Egual (alias Commander Reyes) was charged with the murder of Julian Castillo, a private overseer. Egual moved to quash, arguing the crime was absorbed by rebellion, for which he was already convicted in Laguna.

In G.R. No. L-14240, Egual, Marcelo Mendoza, Sancho Diwa, and Gaudencio Hernandez were charged with assault and triple murder for killing three Philippine Constabulary soldiers who were in civilian clothes. The accused claimed the killing was in furtherance of rebellion.

In G.R. No. L-14209, Hernandez and Mendoza were charged with the murder of Ruperto Publico, a barrio lieutenant. Evidence showed Hernandez ordered the killing due to a personal grudge regarding an overseer position and a refusal to give coconuts to the group.

The trial court convicted the accused in all three cases, rejecting the defense that the crimes were absorbed by rebellion.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the crimes of murder committed by the accused are absorbed by the crime of rebellion.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that murder is not absorbed by rebellion under the following circumstances: (1) the killing was not included in the information for rebellion for which the accused had been previously convicted; (2) there is no evidence to show that it was committed as a necessary means to commit rebellion; (3) the killing was committed in a province other than that in which the rebellion was charged; (4) the deceased had no established connection with the government at the time; or (5) the motive was personal.

In the first case, Egual's rebellion conviction in Laguna did not cover the Batangas murder, and the victim was a private individual. In the second case, the killing of the soldiers was not mentioned in the rebellion cases, nor proven to be in furtherance thereof as the victims were in civilian clothes. In the third case, the killing was motivated by a personal grudge. The Court emphasized that mere membership in the Hukbalahap organization is no reason why all acts and misdeeds should be considered in furtherance of, or absorbed by, rebellion.

The decisions in the first and second cases were AFFIRMED with modification regarding indemnity, and the decision in the third case was AFFIRMED *in toto*.
