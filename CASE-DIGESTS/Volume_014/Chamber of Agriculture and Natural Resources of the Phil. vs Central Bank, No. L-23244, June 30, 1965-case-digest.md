I. CAPTION
CHAMBER OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES OF THE PHILIPPINES, ET AL. v. CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-23244, June 30, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, a group of exporters, filed a prohibition suit to restrain the Central Bank (CB) from enforcing Circulars Nos. 133 and 171. In 1949, the CB restricted foreign exchange under Circular No. 20 due to an exchange crisis [1]. In 1959, R.A. 2609 was enacted, mandating the monetary authorities to adopt a "four-year program of gradual decontrol" [2, 3]. Pursuant to this, CB issued Circular No. 133 in 1962, requiring exporters to surrender 20% of export receipts to the CB at the official par value (P2.00 to $1.00), while allowing the sale of the remaining 80% at free market rates [4, 5]. On April 28, 1964, as the four-year period ended, the CB issued Circular No. 171, continuing the 20% retention because the crisis persisted and Congress failed to enact necessary fiscal measures like an export tax [6-8]. Petitioners argued that under *Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co. v. Central Bank*, the CB lacked the power to "commandeer" exchange, and that R.A. 2609 required total decontrol by 1964 [9, 10].

III. ISSUES
1. W/N the Central Bank has the authority to require the surrender of 20% of export receipts at par value under its Charter.
2. W/N the maintenance of the 20% retention under Circular No. 171 is valid despite the four-year decontrol program in R.A. 2609.
3. W/N the retention constitutes an undue delegation of legislative power or an invalid export tax.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the Central Bank has the authority to license and restrict foreign exchange under Section 74 of its Charter (R.A. 265) to protect international reserves during a crisis [11, 12]. The petitioners' reliance on *Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co. v. Central Bank* was misplaced, as the statement that the CB lacks power to commandeer exchange was merely the personal view of the *ponente* and not the majority ruling [10, 13, 14]. The power to license necessarily implies the authority to impose conditions, such as the surrender of receipts [15].

2. **YES.** Paragraph 2, Section 1 of R.A. 2609 did not imperatively decree *total* decontrol after four years; it only directed authorities to "take steps" for a program of *gradual* decontrol [16]. Total decontrol depended on economic factors and complementary fiscal measures. Since the anticipated export tax was not passed and reserves remained low, the CB was justified in maintaining the retention to protect the economy [12, 17].

3. **NO.** The 20% retention is not an export tax because its proceeds strengthen the international reserve rather than raise government revenue [18]. Nor is it confiscatory, as the retained exchange is paid for at legal parity [5]. Furthermore, the circulars are a valid exercise of emergency powers under fixed standards in R.A. 265, and thus do not constitute an undue delegation of legislative power, consistent with *People v. Jolliffe* [19, 20].

The writ of prohibition is DENIED.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Bengzon, J.P., J. (Concurring):** Emphasized that "gradual decontrol" under R.A. 2609 was tied to economic stability and the passage of complementary measures. Since Congress failed to pass the export tax, total decontrol would have caused serious dislocation; thus, extending restrictions was valid [21-28].

**Bautista Angelo, J. (Dissenting):** Argued that requiring the surrender of 20% at P2.00 when the market rate was higher (approx. P3.90) is confiscatory, effectively depriving exporters of the true value of their earnings. He adhered to the view that such measures require legislative action [29-31].
