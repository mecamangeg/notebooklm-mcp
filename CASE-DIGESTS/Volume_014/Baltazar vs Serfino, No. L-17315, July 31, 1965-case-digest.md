I. CAPTION
OLYMPIA BALTAZAR, in behalf of her minor son, ARMENIO SERFINO v. SERGIO SERFINO, G.R. No. L-17315, July 31, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Olympia Baltazar filed an action for support on behalf of her minor son, Armenio Serfino (born December 19, 1943), against his father, Sergio Serfino, a married man. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental ordered Sergio to pay P15.00 monthly support starting from July 1960, the date of the decision. Olympia appealed, arguing that: (1) the amount should be increased to P50.00; (2) payment should be retroactive to Armenio’s birth (excluding the period he lived with his father from May 1957 to April 1959); and (3) attorney's fees of P1,000.00 should be awarded. The records showed an extrajudicial demand for support was made in June 1959.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the amount of support awarded by the lower court is sufficient.
2. W/N the payment of support should commence from the date of the lower court's decision.
3. W/N the appellants are entitled to attorney's fees.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court increased the monthly support from P15.00 to P25.00. Under Article 296 of the Civil Code, the amount of support must be in proportion to the resources or means of the giver and to the needs of the recipient [1-3].

2. **NO.** Support should be paid from the date of extrajudicial demand, not the date of the decision. While the obligation to give support is demandable from the time the recipient needs it, Article 298 of the Civil Code provides that it shall not be paid except from the date it is extrajudicially demanded. Since the appellants made an extrajudicial demand in June 1959, payment must begin from that date rather than July 1960 [1-3].

3. **YES.** Attorney's fees are recoverable in actions for legal support, even in the absence of a stipulation, pursuant to Article 2208, par. 6 of the Civil Code. The Court held that where the duty to support is admitted but not complied with despite demands, forcing the recipient to resort to the court, the obligor must pay reasonable attorney's fees. The Court awarded P300.00 for this purpose [4-6].

**Judgment modified.**
