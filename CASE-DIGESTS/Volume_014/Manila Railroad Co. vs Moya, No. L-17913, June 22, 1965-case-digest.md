**I. CAPTION**
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. HON. JOSE M. MOYA and CONSUELO L. VDA. DE PRIETO, G.R. No. L-17913, June 22, 1965, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
On May 21, 1958, petitioner Manila Railroad Company (MRR) filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur to reconstitute Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) Nos. 38 and 42 based on plans and technical descriptions [1]. The court granted the petition on January 26, 1959, after notice was published in the Official Gazette and posted in the municipality [2].

On June 28, 1960, respondent Consuelo L. Vda. de Prieto moved to set aside the order regarding Lot 2, alleging she was the owner and possessor of said lot, which was never sold to MRR, and that she was never served notice of the petition [3]. MRR opposed, arguing that publication was sufficient and the order had already become final and executory [4]. The lower court, presided by Judge Moya, set aside the reconstitution order for Lot 2 [4]. MRR filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition to annul Judge Moya's order [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the order of reconstitution is void for failure to send actual notice to the possessor of the property.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. Under **Section 13 of Republic Act No. 26**, when a petition for reconstitution is based on sources such as plans and technical descriptions (falling under Section 3(e) or 3(f)), notice by publication is insufficient [6, 7]. The law explicitly requires that notice be actually sent or delivered to occupants, persons in possession, and other interested parties [7, 8].

Since MRR admitted that Vda. de Prieto was in possession of the questioned Lot 2, she was entitled to actual notice [6]. Failure to serve such notice deprived her of her day in court, rendering the order of reconstitution null and void [9]. A void order never becomes final or executory, and thus can be set aside even after the lapse of the reglementary period for appeal [7].

Petition denied; order affirmed [7].
