I. CAPTION
ENRIQUE SISON and PABLO L. SANTOS, JR. v. HON. JUAN PAJO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18443, May 31, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Sison, Mayor of Bamban, Tarlac, appointed respondent Lacanlale, a veteran but non-civil service eligible, as Acting Chief of Police in 1953. On June 29, 1957, Sison recalled Lacanlale’s appointment and replaced him with petitioner Santos, Jr., who was also a veteran and non-civil service eligible. The Executive Secretary declared the removal illegal under the Veterans' Preference Law (R.A. No. 65) and ordered Lacanlale's reinstatement. Sison refused and filed a petition for injunction. The trial court dismissed the petition, declared Lacanlale's removal illegal, and ordered his reinstatement with back salaries. Petitioners appealed, arguing that an acting appointment is terminable at pleasure and that Santos, Jr. had subsequently acquired civil service eligibility in 1959.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the replacement of a veteran non-eligible Acting Chief of Police by another veteran non-eligible is valid.
2. W/N the subsequent civil service eligibility of the replacement cures the illegality of the previous removal.
3. W/N the municipality must be formally impleaded to be liable for back salaries.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The replacement is unlawful. Under Republic Act No. 1363 and Republic Act No. 65, the preference accorded to veterans applies not only to the appointment but also to the *keeping* of the position. A veteran non-eligible, even if appointed in an acting capacity, is entitled to hold the office until the Commissioner of Civil Service certifies the availability of a civil service eligible. He cannot be replaced by another non-eligible, even if the latter is also a veteran.

2. **NO.** The subsequent reappointment of Santos, Jr. after passing the civil service examination cannot retroactively validate the unlawful removal of Lacanlale. Since Lacanlale’s separation was illegal, the position was never legally vacated. Eligibility acquired later does not cure the invalidity of the removal *ab initio*.

3. **NO.** The payment of back salaries is merely incidental to reinstatement. The failure to implead the municipal corporation by name is a mere formality. Since the Mayor and other officials were parties and defended the suit, the ends of justice are served by considering the municipality impleaded.

Petition **DENIED**. Decision affirmed with the modification that back salaries be paid to the judicial administrator of the deceased respondent’s estate.
