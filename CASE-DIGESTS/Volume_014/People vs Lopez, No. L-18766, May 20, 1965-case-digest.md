I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RAMON LOPEZ, G.R. No. L-18766, May 20, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On December 21, 1960, the Chief of Police of Bacuag, Surigao del Norte apprehended Ramon Lopez and two companions who were loitering in the area. The police confiscated a bag from them containing firearms, ammunition, and "seven false keys, one of which was a master key." Lopez was charged in the Court of First Instance of Surigao del Norte with Illegal Possession of False Keys. The information alleged that the accused possessed "seven (7) false keys, one of which is a picklock or master key" without lawful cause. Lopez pleaded not guilty and subsequently moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the information failed to allege an essential element of the offense: that the tools were "specially adapted to the commission of the crime of robbery." The trial court agreed and dismissed the case. The prosecution appealed this dismissal to the Supreme Court [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the information for illegal possession of a picklock is valid and sufficient even if it does not explicitly allege that the tool was "specially adapted to the commission of the crime of robbery." [4, 5]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the information was sufficient. Under Article 304 of the Revised Penal Code, the crime requires two elements: (1) possession of picklocks or similar tools specially adapted to the commission of robbery, and (2) such possession is without lawful cause [6]. The Court held that since picking locks is a mode of gaining entrance to commit robbery under Articles 299 and 302 of the Revised Penal Code, a picklock is *per se* specially adapted to the commission of robbery [5, 7]. Therefore, explicitly describing a picklock as "specially adapted to the commission of robbery" in the information is unnecessary for its sufficiency [5]. Additionally, Article 305 defines "false keys" to include the tools mentioned in Article 304; thus, the use of the term "false keys" in the information sufficiently described the tools in question [5].

The order quashing the information was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the court of origin for further trial [8].
