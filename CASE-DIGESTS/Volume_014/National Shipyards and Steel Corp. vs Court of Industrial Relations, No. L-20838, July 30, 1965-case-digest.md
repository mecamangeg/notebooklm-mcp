I. CAPTION
NATIONAL SHIPYARDS AND STEEL CORPORATION v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and JOSE ABIDAY, et al., G.R. No. L-20838, July 30, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Jose Abiday and 38 others were employed as crew members of tugboats owned by petitioner National Shipyards and Steel Corporation (NASSCO). On April 15, 1957, respondents filed a case with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) claiming overtime compensation. On November 22, 1957, the CIR ordered NASSCO to pay 25% additional compensation for work in excess of eight hours. This order was affirmed after NASSCO’s previous petitions for certiorari were dismissed by the Supreme Court.

On November 25, 1960, respondents filed a petition with the CIR to compute overtime pay for the specific periods of 1949-1953 and 1958-1960. The CIR examiner submitted a report crediting respondents with an average of five hours of overtime daily, which the CIR approved. NASSCO appealed, arguing that: (1) there was no evidence to support the finding of five hours overtime; and (2) the CIR lacked jurisdiction over three specific respondents (Riaza, Legaspi, and Zulueta) because they were no longer NASSCO employees at the time the 1960 motion for computation was filed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR’s finding of fact regarding the overtime hours rendered is supported by evidence.
2. W/N the CIR retained jurisdiction over claims of employees who had separated from service at the time the motion for computation was filed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the CIR’s finding that laborers worked overtime is a finding of fact which the Court cannot disturb if supported by sufficient evidence [1, 2]. The Court found the examiner's report was supported by the testimony of NASSCO's own marine land surveyor, who testified that while the crew was supposed to work on three 8-hour shifts, understaffing (assigning only two men instead of three) forced crew members to ordinarily work at least 12 hours a day [3].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the CIR had jurisdiction because the three respondents were actually employees of NASSCO at the time the case was originally decided and the order granting overtime pay was issued on November 22, 1957 [4]. The fact that they were no longer employees when the subsequent motion for computation was filed in 1960 did not divest the CIR of its jurisdiction [4, 5].

Petition for review is denied; decision sustained.
