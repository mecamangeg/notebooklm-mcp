**I. CAPTION**
SANTIAGO MANZANO v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20815, May 19, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
On November 29, 1960, the Court of First Instance of La Union rendered a decision ordering Marcos and Macario Bambico to vacate a land and pay Santiago Manzano damages [1]. Upon finality of the decision, the sheriff levied on two parcels of land and a residential house occupied by Marcos Bambico, selling them at public auction to Manzano [2]. After the one-year redemption period lapsed, Manzano obtained a final certificate of sale and, on June 20, 1963, moved for the demolition of the house [2, 3].

The Bambicos opposed the demolition, and Zoila Sabado, Marcos's wife, filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals [3, 4]. She argued that she had a pending separate action (Civil Case No. 1744) for annulment of the execution proceedings, claiming the properties were conjugal and not exclusively owned by Marcos [4, 5]. The Court of Appeals granted the writ and set aside the demolition order, prompting Manzano to file this petition for review [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the trial court properly ordered the demolition of the house despite a pending separate action questioning the ownership of the levied property.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals, holding that the order of demolition was improper. Although the property was tax-declared in the name of the judgment debtor, Marcos Bambico, his wife Zoila Sabado had seasonably brought a separate action to annul the execution proceedings to prove the property was conjugal [5].

The Court ruled that the failure of the wife to file a third-party claim with the sheriff did not bar her from asserting ownership in a separate action, pursuant to Section 17, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court [5]. Since an action to annul the execution was already pending, fairness dictated that the demolition be stayed to give the interested parties a chance to be heard concerning their claims on the property [5].

Petition is **DENIED**.
