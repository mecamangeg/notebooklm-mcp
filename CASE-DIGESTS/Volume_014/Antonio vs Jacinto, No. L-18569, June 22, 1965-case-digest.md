I. CAPTION
PLACIDO ANTONIO, ET AL. v. PETRONILO JACINTO, G.R. No. L-18569, June 22, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Antonio, et al. filed a complaint for recovery of possession of land against Defendant Jacinto in the Court of First Instance of Isabela [1]. Defendant received the summons on April 12, 1958 [2]. On April 26, one day before the expiration of the reglementary period, his counsel filed a motion for extension of time to answer [2]. However, due to the temporary absence of the presiding judge and a strike at the Rural Transit which delayed the mail, the motion remained unacted upon for some time [3, 4]. The trial court eventually declared Defendant in default and rendered judgment against him on July 16, 1958 [4]. Defendant filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied for lack of verification and affidavit of merit, followed by a petition for relief from judgment which was also denied [4, 5]. Defendant appealed, arguing it was error to declare him in default while his motion for extension was pending resolution [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in declaring the defendant in default while his motion for extension of time to answer was pending.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order denying relief [6]. The Court ruled that where a motion for extension to file an answer continues unacted upon by the court for some time, "the least the attorney for the defendant could do in the meantime is to file the answer" [7, 8]. The Court found no abuse of discretion by the lower court, noting that the defendant's previous motion for reconsideration of the default order was defective for lack of verification and affidavit of merit [8]. While the Court noted that under Rule 41, Section 2 of the Revised Rules of Court, a party in default may appeal a judgment even without a Rule 38 petition for relief, the trial court's refusal to lift the default in this instance was sustained based on the circumstances of the negligence [6, 8].
