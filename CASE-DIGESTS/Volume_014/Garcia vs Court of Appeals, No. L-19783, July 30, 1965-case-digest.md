I. CAPTION
TECLA GARCIA v. COURT OF APPEALS and PATRICIA DIMAUNAHAN, G.R. No. L-19783, July 30, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Hilarion Dimaunahan died in 1943. His widow, petitioner Tecla Garcia, instituted summary settlement proceedings (Case No. 3949) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Batangas [1]. The decedent's sister, respondent Patricia Dimaunahan, filed an opposition claiming four parcels of land based on a 1944 affidavit of transfer allegedly executed by Garcia [2]. However, Patricia failed to prosecute her opposition, leading the CFI Batangas to dismiss it in 1949 and approve the project of partition [3, 4]. This dismissal became final after the Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's actions in a separate petition [5].

Subsequently, Patricia filed a new action for specific performance in the CFI of Manila (Case No. 20057) to compel Garcia to execute a deed of conveyance for the same four parcels based on the same 1944 affidavit [5]. Garcia moved to dismiss on the ground of *res judicata*. The CFI Manila dismissed the complaint, but the Court of Appeals reversed this decision, ruling that the cause of action for specific performance was distinct from the summary settlement proceedings [5, 6]. Garcia petitioned the Supreme Court for review.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for specific performance is barred by *res judicata* due to the prior dismissal of the opposition in the settlement proceedings.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and ruled that the action is barred by *res judicata*.

The Court held that all elements of *res judicata* were present: (1) the CFI Batangas had jurisdiction to decide the claim; (2) there was a judgment on the merits, as the dismissal of Patricia's opposition for failure to prosecute operates as an adjudication on the merits under Rule 17, Section 3 of the Revised Rules of Court [7, 8]; (3) the parties are the same; and (4) the causes of action are identical [8].

The Court explained that the test for identity of causes of action is not the form of the action, but whether the same evidence would support and establish both causes [9]. In this case, both the opposition in the settlement proceedings and the specific performance suit relied on the exact same evidence—the 1944 affidavit—to claim the same four parcels of land [9]. A change in the form of action cannot avoid the bar of a prior judgment.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED**, and the decision of the Court of First Instance dismissing the suit is **CONFIRMED** [10].
