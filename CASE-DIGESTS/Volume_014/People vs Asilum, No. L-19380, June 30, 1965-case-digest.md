I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GASPAR ASILUM and DONATO LLORCA, G.R. No. L-19380, June 30, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of November 15, 1957, in Uson, Masbate, Gaspar Asilum and Donato Llorca entered the house of Emilio Dionson while the family was asleep [1]. Llorca, armed with a gun and flashlight, and Asilum, armed with a bolo, confronted Dionson [1]. Llorca shot Dionson in the right thigh, then used Asilum’s bolo to threaten the victim and demand money [1]. Dionson’s wife, Gregoria, surrendered P1,500.00 to the robbers [1]. Dionson died on January 5, 1958, due to hemorrhage from the gunshot wound [2]. The Court of First Instance of Masbate convicted both accused but found Asilum guilty only of simple robbery, reasoning that there was no evidence he knew Llorca would shoot Dionson [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Asilum is liable for the complex crime of robbery with homicide despite the lower court's finding that he did not know Llorca would shoot the victim.
2. W/N the death penalty is proper given the aggravating circumstances of dwelling and nighttime.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that Asilum is liable for robbery with homicide. The fact that both accused entered the house armed—one with a gun and the other with a bolo—demonstrated they were ready to kill if necessary [3]. Asilum showed no surprise when Llorca fired at the victim; instead, he immediately handed his bolo to Llorca to help coerce the victim, revealing a "complete community of purpose and action" between them [3], [4].

2. **NO.** Although the crime was robbery with homicide attended by aggravating circumstances (dwelling and nighttime), the Court ruled that the interest of justice would be better served by imposing life imprisonment rather than death [4]. The Court noted that Llorca fired at the victim's right thigh, suggesting he "probably did not intend to kill him" [4]. While this lack of intent does not relieve the accused of criminal liability for the resulting death, it justifies a penalty of life imprisonment instead of the maximum penalty of death [4].

**Disposition:** The decision is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION; Asilum's penalty is increased to life imprisonment [5].
