I. CAPTION
BENGUET CONSOLIDATED, INC. v. CECILIO MONTEMAYOR, in his capacity as Director of the Cooperative Administration Office, and ACUPAN MINERS COOPERATIVE CREDIT UNION, INC., G.R. No. L-19780, June 30, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
The Acupan Miners Cooperative Credit Union, Inc. (Cooperative), composed of employees of Benguet Consolidated, Inc. (Benguet), required members to pay a P100.00 fixed deposit (payable in weekly installments of P8.00) and a P1.00 membership fee [1, 2]. Pursuant to Section 62 of Republic Act No. 2023 (Philippine Non-Agricultural Cooperative Act), the Cooperative’s counsel, Atty. Alexander Brillantes, sent a letter to Benguet requesting the deduction of these amounts from the salaries of member-employees [3]. Benguet refused, citing additional clerical expenses and alleged conflict with the Minimum Wage Law [3].

The Cooperative and the Director of the Cooperative Administration Office filed a petition for Mandamus [4]. The Court of First Instance of Baguio City ruled in favor of the Cooperative, ordering Benguet to make the deductions [4]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision [5]. Benguet appealed via certiorari, arguing that the employees were not yet "members" until fees were paid, and that the "debt" referred to in the law did not cover membership fees [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the employer is legally obligated under Section 62 of R.A. 2023 to deduct the fixed deposits and membership fees from the salaries of employees who are members of the cooperative.
2. W/N the request made by the cooperative's legal counsel satisfies the statutory requirement for a "request in writing" by the cooperative.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that Benguet has a legal duty to deduct the amounts. Under Section 3 of R.A. 2023, an applicant is deemed a member upon approval by the board, even before payment of fees. Thus, they are entitled to the benefits of Section 62 *vis-a-vis* the employer, even if they cannot yet exercise rights *vis-a-vis* the Cooperative [7, 8]. Furthermore, the phrase "any debt or other demand" in Section 62 is broad and includes membership fees and deposits, not merely debts for goods or loans [9]. This interpretation aligns with the law's spirit to facilitate the establishment of cooperatives by allowing laborers to pay necessary outlays through salary deductions [10].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the letter from the Cooperative’s counsel and consultant, Atty. Brillantes, fairly satisfied the requirement of a written request by the union [11]. As the lawyer acting on behalf of the client, his demand is equivalent to a notice from the union itself [11].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [12].
