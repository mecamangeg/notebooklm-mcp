I. CAPTION
DIEGO BACORDO v. JACINTO ALCANTARA and PRESENTACION MACATANGAY, G.R. No. L-20080, July 30, 1965, Bengzon, J.P.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellee Diego Bacordo obtained a loan of P1,600.00 from defendant-appellant Spouses Alcantara in 1956, secured by a real estate mortgage over a parcel of land in Batangas. The agreement allowed redemption within 9 years. In March 1961, Bacordo borrowed an additional P150.00 (total P1,750.00) and executed a second mortgage deed which explicitly stated he could pay "within 9 years." Two months later, in May 1961, Bacordo borrowed another P100.00 (total P1,850.00) and executed a third mortgage deed. Unlike the previous deeds, the third document stipulated that the loan would last for 9 years and payment would be made "on May 26, 1970, or after 9 years."

In September 1961, Bacordo tendered the full P1,850.00 to redeem the property. The spouses refused to accept it, claiming the obligation was not yet due under the third deed. Bacordo deposited the amount with the Clerk of Court (consignation) and filed a suit for rescission and specific performance. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Bacordo, finding the third deed did not express the true intent of the parties, and declared the contract rescinded. The spouses appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the mortgagor may redeem the property before the expiration of the 9-year period despite the wording of the third mortgage deed.
2. W/N the lower court was correct in declaring the rescission of the mortgage contract.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the previous, simultaneous, and subsequent acts of the parties are properly cognizable indicia of their true intention (*Velasquez v. Teodoro*). The second mortgage agreement clearly showed the intention to allow redemption *within* 9 years. It was suspicious and contrary to equity that for a mere additional loan of P100.00, the mortgagor would agree to postpone the right of redemption to nine years later, a term highly unfavorable to him. Since the mortgagees had possession and enjoyed the fruits of the land for years, their investment was fully recompensed. Thus, the third document must be interpreted to allow redemption within the 9-year period.

2. **NO.** While Article 1191 of the Civil Code allows rescission for breach of reciprocal obligations (such as the refusal to accept valid redemption), the plaintiff in this case explicitly elected the *fulfillment* of the obligation by tendering payment and filing suit to compel the acceptance of the redemption. Where a plaintiff elects fulfillment, rescission cannot be declared at the same time.

**Judgment affirmed with the modification that the declaration of rescission is eliminated.**
