I. CAPTION
RUFINO COLOMA and TIMOTEO COLOMA v. ATANACIO COLOMA, MAMERTO COLOMA and CALIXTO COLOMA, G.R. No. L-19399, July 31, 1965, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Agapito Geronimo died in 1949. In 1961, his nephews Rufino and Timoteo (Petitioners) filed a complaint for partition of thirteen parcels of land against their brother Atanacio and his sons (Respondents), alleging Agapito died intestate. Respondents moved to dismiss, arguing the action was barred by a prior judgment in Special Proceedings No. 3204, where the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte probated Agapito's will and distributed the estate to Respondents and others, excluding Petitioners. Petitioners amended their complaint to annul the probate proceedings, claiming the decree was void due to fraud, lack of notice to heirs, and improper publication. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground of *res judicata*.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the complaint for partition is barred by *res judicata* due to the prior probate proceedings.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that all elements of *res judicata* were present. First, the probate court in Special Proceedings No. 3204 had jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties, and the order admitting the will to probate had become final. Second, there was identity of parties because probate proceedings are *in rem* and directed against the whole world, making the judgment binding on Petitioners (citing *Manalo v. Paredes*). Third, there was identity of subject matter (Agapito's estate) and causes of action (determination of heirship and will validity). Finally, the Court noted that Petitioners were merely collateral heirs (nephews) and not forced heirs; thus, they had no right to intervene or claim a share since the testator had validly disposed of his estate by will (citing *Gutierrez del Campo v. Varela Calderon*). The Order appealed from is affirmed.
