I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. EDILBERTO DE LOS SANTOS, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-19067-68, July 30, 1965, 14 SCRA 702, J.B.L. Reyes, J.

II. FACTS
Fourteen (14) inmates of the New Bilibid Prisons, belonging to the "Sigue-Sigue" gang, were charged with multiple murder for the killing of nine (9) members of the rival "Oxo" gang during riots on February 16 and 17, 1958 [1][2][3]. The riots were premeditated; the accused, armed with improvised weapons, forcibly opened cell doors and brutally killed the victims through stabbing, clubbing, beheading, and burning [4][5][6]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal convicted all fourteen accused and imposed the death penalty [7]. In its decision, the trial court vividly described the "inhuman conditions" at the penitentiary, including extreme overcrowding (8,304 prisoners in facilities meant for 5,000) and starvation-level food allowances (ten centavos per meal), which the judge noted forced inmates to form gangs for survival and predisposed them to violence [8][9][10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused are guilty of multiple murder.
2. W/N the death penalty should be imposed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the findings of guilt, holding that conspiracy was evident from the mass movement, timing, uniform manner of killings, and the members' obedience to their leaders' commands [6]. The Court found the testimonies of prosecution witnesses credible and rejected the defense of alibi given the limited distance within the prison compound [11][12].

2. **NO.** The Court reduced the penalty to life imprisonment. Although the crime legally warranted capital punishment, the Justices stated they "cannot in conscience concur" in the death penalty due to the "contributory role played by the inhuman conditions" reigning in the prison [10]. The Court held that the government cannot evade responsibility for keeping prisoners in subhuman conditions—described as "dantesque"—which inevitably led to the formation of wolf-pack gangs and the resulting violence [10].

Decision affirmed with modification; the death penalty is reduced to life imprisonment [13][14].
