I. CAPTION
IRINEO S. BALTAZAR v. LINGAYEN GULF ELECTRIC POWER CO., INC., et al. (consolidated with *Rose v. Lingayen Gulf Electric Power Co., Inc.* and *Baltazar, et al. v. Acena*), G.R. Nos. L-16236, L-16237 & L-16238, June 30, 1965, 121 Phil. 1302, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Baltazar and Rose were incorporators and stockholders of Lingayen Gulf Electric Power Co., Inc. having subscribed to 600 and 400 shares, respectively [1]. It was the Corporation's practice to issue stock certificates to subscribers for the portion of their subscriptions that was fully paid [2, 3]. Baltazar had fully paid for and received certificates for 535 shares, while Rose held certificates for 375 fully paid shares [2].

A struggle for management control ensued between the "Baltazar group" and the "Ungson group" (defendants, who formed the majority of the Board) [4, 5]. To retain control, the Ungson-led Board passed three resolutions: (1) cancelling "watered stocks" (unpaid subscriptions); (2) requiring unpaid subscriptions to bear interest, applying previous payments first to interest and then to capital; and (3) declaring that shares issued for partial payments could not be voted until the delinquency and interest were paid [6-9].

The lower court initially approved a compromise agreement but later issued an order on July 16, 1959, ruling that all shares covered by fully paid certificates were entitled to vote and nullifying the Board resolutions inconsistent with this ruling [10, 11]. Defendants appealed, arguing that under the doctrine in *Fua Cun v. Summers*, a subscription is indivisible and partial payment does not entitle a shareholder to a certificate or voting rights until the full subscription price is paid [12, 13].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a stockholder who makes partial payments on a subscription and is issued certificates for the paid portion is entitled to vote those shares.
2. W/N the corporation may unilaterally apply previous payments to interest instead of capital, thereby invalidating issued certificates.
3. W/N the plaintiffs are estopped from challenging the resolutions due to the compromise agreement.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that stockholders are entitled to vote the shares for which they have paid and received certificates. While the doctrine in *Fua Cun v. Summers* generally treats subscriptions as indivisible, the Court held it inapplicable here because: (a) it was the Corporation's established practice to issue certificates for paid portions of subscriptions [3]; and (b) Section 37 of the Corporation Law (as amended) provides that no certificate shall be issued until the "full par value thereof" is paid [14, 15]. This implies that for par value stocks, a certificate may be issued for the specific number of shares fully paid for, separating them from the unpaid portion [15]. Since certificates were issued, those specific shares are considered fully paid and legally carry voting rights, independent of the remaining unpaid subscription [15].

2. **NO.** The Corporation cannot retroactively apply payments to interest to the prejudice of the stockholders. The Corporation had already exercised its option to apply the payments to the capital (par value) and issued the corresponding certificates [16]. The stockholders accepted these certificates. Under Article 1253 of the Civil Code, the rule that payment applies to interest first is directory and applies only in the absence of an agreement to the contrary [16]. The issuance and acceptance of certificates constituted an agreement to apply payments to the principal capital [16].

3. **NO.** The Court held that estoppel cannot be predicated on acts prohibited by law or against public policy [17]. The clauses in the agreement/resolutions that deprived stockholders of their vested voting rights on fully paid shares were contrary to law [17].

The Order of the trial court declaring the shares entitled to vote and nullifying the Board resolutions is **AFFIRMED** [18].
