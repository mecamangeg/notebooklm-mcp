I. CAPTION
SEVERO ROMERO, ET AL. v. ISABELO DE LOS REYES, JR., ETC., G.R. No. L-13816, May 31, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
The Iglesia Filipina Independiente (IFI) split into two factions: one headed by Bishop Santiago Fonacier and the other by respondent Bishop Isabelo de los Reyes, Jr. In a prior accounting case filed in 1946 (G.R. No. L-5917), the Supreme Court ruled that De los Reyes was the legitimate Obispo Maximo of the IFI. In that case, Fonacier had alleged that De los Reyes committed abjuration/apostasy, but the Court found no factual basis for such claim.

On August 24, 1957, petitioners Romero et al., claiming to be faithful adherents of IFI, filed the present class suit against De los Reyes to recover possession of IFI properties. They based their cause of action on the alleged abjuration of De los Reyes—the same issue raised in the previous case. During the hearing for the issuance of a preliminary injunction, De los Reyes raised the defense of *res judicata* based on the decision in G.R. No. L-5917. However, De los Reyes failed to file an Answer within the reglementary period and was declared in default.

The Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte subsequently dismissed the complaint on the ground of *res judicata*. Petitioners appealed, arguing that the lower court erred in taking cognizance of *res judicata* *motu proprio* since it was not pleaded in a Motion to Dismiss or an Answer.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court may dismiss the case on the ground of *res judicata* *motu proprio* even if not pleaded as an affirmative defense.
2. W/N the present action is barred by *res judicata* due to the judgment in G.R. No. L-5917.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While *res judicata* is ordinarily pleaded as an affirmative defense, a court can take up the question *motu proprio* when convinced that an irregularity or injustice would be committed due to a lawyer's omission. The defense of prior judgment was brought out by the defendant during the injunction hearing, and the trial court could take judicial notice of the Supreme Court decision. To ignore the evidence produced by the plaintiffs themselves showing the prior case would be a disservice to the administration of justice; technicalities that do not aid in the just determination of litigation should be laid aside.

2. **YES.** The requisites for *res judicata* are present: (a) final judgment; (b) jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties; (c) judgment on the merits; and (d) identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action (*San Diego v. Cardona*).
   *   **Identity of Parties:** There is privity in law or estate. The present case is a continuation of the rivalry between Fonacier and De los Reyes. The petitioners are merely followers of Fonacier, who represented "his church" in the prior case. Petitioners are suing for the same church interest, making them part of the identical group from the earlier litigation (*Oberiano v. Sobremesana*).
   *   **Identity of Subject Matter:** Both cases involve the control, possession, and administration of IFI properties.
   *   **Identity of Cause of Action:** The issue of De los Reyes' alleged abjuration was raised, passed upon, and rejected in G.R. No. L-5917. The Court previously held there was no factual basis for the claim of abjuration.

The judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED.
