I. CAPTION
THE PHILIPPINE ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENT RETIREES, INC. v. THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM (GSIS), et al. (and SIMEON MORALES v. GSIS), G.R. Nos. L-20503 and L-20632, June 30, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Following the Supreme Court's decision in *Bautista v. Auditor General* (1958), which held that government employees compulsorily retired at age 65 are entitled to a refund of the 5% discount deducted from their five-year lump sum annuity, numerous retirees sought refunds from the GSIS.

In G.R. No. L-20503, the GSIS Board of Trustees passed Resolution No. 2944 offering a "differential" payment based on a specific formula in lieu of a full refund. While some retirees accepted this via quitclaims, the Philippine Association of Government Retirees, Inc. (PAGR) objected and filed a petition to compel the full refund of the 5% discount.

In G.R. No. L-20632, Simeon Morales, a compulsory retiree, sued the GSIS for the recovery of the 5% discount (P1,066.25) deducted from his lump sum.

The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of PAGR and Morales in their respective cases, ordering the GSIS to refund the discounts. The GSIS appealed, arguing that new facts—specifically views expressed on the floor of the House of Representatives during the deliberation of Republic Act No. 660—indicated a legislative intent contrary to the *Bautista* ruling [1], [2], [3], [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N government employees compulsorily retired at age 65 are entitled to a refund of the 5% discount deducted by the GSIS from their five-year lump sum annuity.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court decisions, reiterating the doctrine laid down in *Bautista v. Auditor General*. The Court held that under Commonwealth Act No. 186, as amended by Republic Act No. 660, compulsorily retired employees are entitled to the "present value" of their annuity for the first five years without the 5% discount [5], [6]. The Court reasoned that the law was enacted for the benefit of the employee to provide for old age and disability, and the term "present value" is used in its ordinary, not technical, sense [7].

Regarding the GSIS's reliance on congressional deliberations, the Court ruled that views expressed by individual members on the floor of the House of Representatives do not necessarily reflect the feeling of the legislative body and are not controlling in the interpretation of the law [4].

Decisions affirmed [8].
