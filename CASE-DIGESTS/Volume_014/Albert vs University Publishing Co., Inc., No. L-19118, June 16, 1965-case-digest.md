I. CAPTION
MARIANO A. ALBERT v. UNIVERSITY PUBLISHING CO., INC., G.R. No. L-19118, June 16, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Mariano Albert sued University Publishing Co., Inc. for breach of contract. The Supreme Court previously awarded him P15,000.00 in damages. When the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila issued a writ of execution, Albert discovered through the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that "University Publishing Co., Inc." was not registered. Albert petitioned for the writ to be issued against Jose M. Aruego, the company’s President, arguing Aruego was the real defendant. The company opposed, stating Aruego was not a party. The CFI denied Albert’s petition. On appeal, the Supreme Court ruled on January 30, 1965, that the company’s non-registration meant it had no separate personality from Aruego, making him personally liable. In a Motion for Reconsideration, the company sought to introduce—for the first time—original registration papers from 1936 to prove its corporate existence, arguing these were "original papers" admissible under the Rules of Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Jose M. Aruego is personally liable for the judgment against the corporation.
2. W/N the corporation may admit evidence of its registration for the first time on a Motion for Reconsideration before the Supreme Court.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that since the company was proven unregistered by SEC certification during the lower court proceedings, it has no juridical personality separate from its President, Jose M. Aruego. Aruego, who negotiated the contract, made partial payments, and litigated the case, is the real party in interest. The Court ruled that the purpose of impleading a party is to assure due process; since Aruego effectively had his day in court and utilized the "protective mantle of due process," he can be held liable as the real litigant despite the imperfection in form.

2. **NO.** The Court rejected the belated submission of registration papers. Under Section 7, Rule 48 of the Rules of Court, an appellate court may inspect original papers only if they are part of the lower court's record; it does not allow the introduction of new evidence not presented below. Furthermore, under Rule 53, the documents do not qualify as "newly discovered evidence" because they were in the movant's possession and control throughout the litigation. The Court cited the principle that a litigant is not allowed to speculate on a decision by withholding evidence and only presenting it after receiving an adverse judgment.

The Motion for Reconsideration and for leave to file original papers was **DENIED**.
