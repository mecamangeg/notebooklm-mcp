I. CAPTION
**HONESTO ALVAREZ, ET AL. v. PEDRO K. ESPIRITU**, G.R. No. L-18833, August 14, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
In 1910, Consolacion Evangelista purchased Lot No. 292 of the Tala Estate (friar land) via a Sales Certificate, paying the first installment [1]. She married the respondent, Pedro K. Espiritu, in 1923 [2]. The remaining installments were paid with conjugal funds and completed in 1927. That same year, Consolacion executed an "Assignment of Sales Certificate" transferring her rights to Pedro, resulting in the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 14527 in both their names [2, 3].

In 1946, the spouses sold half the lot *pacto de retro*. Consolacion died in 1949, bequeathing her "half interest" to Pedro in her will [3]. Pedro summarily settled the estate in the CFI of Bulacan, which adjudicated 1/4 of the lot to him [4, 5]. Later, Pedro redeemed the sold half with his own money [6, 7].

The petitioners (Consolacion’s collateral heirs) filed an action in the CFI of Rizal claiming the lot was paraphernal and they were entitled to the undisposed 3/4 portion [8]. The CFI ruled the lot was conjugal property because conjugal funds paid the installments and the title was in both names [9, 10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the friar land purchased by the wife before marriage but fully paid with conjugal funds is paraphernal property.
2. W/N the assignment of the sales certificate by the wife to the husband is valid.
3. W/N the husband’s redemption of the property using his own money makes him the owner.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The lot is paraphernal. Under the Friar Lands Act (Act No. 1120), equitable and beneficial title passes to the purchaser the moment the first installment is paid and a certificate of sale is issued (*Director of Lands v. Rizal*) [11]. Since Consolacion acquired the certificate in 1910 prior to her marriage in 1923, the property is exclusive to her. The fact that conjugal funds were used to pay the remaining installments does not convert it to conjugal property; it merely grants the conjugal partnership the right to reimbursement for the expenses under Article 1410 of the Civil Code (*Lorenzo v. Nicolas*) [12].

2. **NO.** The assignment is void. The transaction between the spouses is a patent nullity under Articles 1334 and 1458 of the Civil Code, which prohibit donations and sales between spouses during the marriage [12]. The registration of the title in the names of both spouses does not divest the wife of ownership but merely creates a trust to be restored to the real owner upon liquidation [13, 14].

3. **NO.** The redemption of paraphernal property by the husband, even with his own money, does not make him the owner. It revests ownership in the heirs of the wife. The husband merely holds a lien on the property for the amount he paid (*Guinto v. Lim Bonfing*) [15].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the case is remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings [16].
