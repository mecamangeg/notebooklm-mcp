**I. CAPTION**
**FILOMENA ABELLANA DE BACAYO v. GAUDENCIA FERRARIS DE BORROMEO, CATALINA FERRARIS DE VILLEGAS, JUANITO FERRARIS and CONCHITA FERRARIS, G.R. No. L-19382, August 31, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.**

**II. FACTS**
Melodia Ferraris, a resident of Cebu City, died intestate leaving no surviving direct descendants, ascendants, or spouse [1]. She was survived only by collateral relatives: the petitioner Filomena Abellana de Bacayo (her aunt and half-sister of her father) and the respondents (her nieces and nephew, children of her predeceased only brother of full blood, Arturo Ferraris) [1].

In the summary settlement of Melodia's estate, the petitioner sought to participate as an heir, arguing that she is of the same degree of relationship (third degree) as the respondents and should inherit concurrently with them [2]. The Court of First Instance of Cebu excluded the petitioner, ruling that the nephews and nieces exclude the aunt from succession [3, 4]. The petitioner appealed directly to the Supreme Court on points of law [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a decedent’s aunt may succeed *ab intestato* concurrently with the decedent's nephews and nieces [5].

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision excluding the petitioner. Although the Court agreed with the petitioner that an aunt and a nephew/niece are of the same degree of relationship (three degrees from the decedent) [2], the Civil Code establishes an order of preference.

Under **Article 1009 of the Civil Code**, the absence of brothers, sisters, nephews, and nieces is a precondition for "other collaterals" (such as uncles, aunts, and cousins) to be called to succession [6]. The Court held that nephews and nieces exclude all other collaterals from the estate [7]. While they are all third-degree relatives, the law prefers the line of brothers/sisters (and their children) over other collateral lines. Consequently, an aunt cannot succeed so long as nephews and nieces survive and are qualified to inherit [8].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [8, 9].
