**I. CAPTION**
**FELICISIMA MANUBAY v. PEDRO DE GUZMAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21506, August 14, 1965, Regala, J.**

**II. FACTS**
On February 28, 1961, respondent Pedro de Guzman filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) to convert his tenancy relationship with petitioner Felicisima Manubay from a crop-sharing system to a leasehold system [1]. The CAR ruled in favor of De Guzman, authorizing the change in relationship. Manubay's motion for reconsideration was denied, prompting her to appeal to the Supreme Court [1].

While the appeal was pending, the parties entered into an amicable settlement denominated as "*Malayang Pag-aayos*" on May 3, 1965 [2]. Under the agreement, Manubay agreed to condone De Guzman's palay indebtedness and pay him P600.00. In exchange, De Guzman agreed to return the subject land to Manubay and release certain deposited palay in her favor [3, 4]. The parties submitted this agreement to the Court for resolution [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the compromise agreement entered into by the parties should be approved.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court found nothing in the amicable agreement to be contrary to any existing law or sound public policy [4]. Accordingly, the "*Malayang Pag-aayos*" was approved. The Court rendered judgment in accordance with the terms of the settlement, which included the return of the land to the petitioner upon payment of P600.00 to the respondent [4].
