I. CAPTION
**COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. PHOENIX ASSURANCE CO., LTD.** (and vice versa)
G.R. Nos. L-19727 & L-19903, May 20, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Phoenix Assurance Co., Ltd. is a foreign insurance corporation licensed in the Philippines. It entered into reinsurance treaties in London, ceding portions of premiums earned in the Philippines to foreign reinsurers not doing business in the Philippines. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed withholding tax on these ceded premiums.

Phoenix also filed income tax returns for 1950, 1952, 1953, and 1954.
1.  **1950 Return:** Phoenix claimed a deduction for marine insurance reserve (40% of premiums). The CIR disallowed part of this, asserting the proper calculation was 100% of premiums from the last three months.
2.  **1952 Return:** Phoenix filed its original return on April 1, 1953, declaring a loss. On August 30, 1955, it filed an *amended* return excluding ceded reinsurance premiums and reporting tax liability. On July 24, 1958, the CIR assessed a deficiency, disallowing part of the "head office expenses" claimed.
3.  **Head Office Expenses:** For 1952-1954, Phoenix claimed head office expenses allocable to the Philippines calculated at 5% of its *gross* Philippine income. The CIR contended this should be 5% of the *net* Philippine income (excluding income not taxable in the Philippines).

The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled that the withholding tax was due; the 1950 deduction was allowed; the head office expenses should be based on net income; and the CIR's right to assess the 1952 deficiency had prescribed because the 5-year period should count from the *original* return (1953). Both parties appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1.  W/N reinsurance premiums ceded to foreign reinsurers not doing business in the Philippines are subject to withholding tax.
2.  W/N the CIR's right to assess deficiency income tax for 1952 has prescribed (specifically, W/N the period commences from the filing of the amended return).
3.  W/N the deduction claimed for marine insurance reserve for 1950 is excessive.
4.  W/N head office expenses allocable to the Philippine business should be computed based on gross income.

IV. RULING
1.  **YES.** Reinsurance premiums ceded to foreign reinsurers not doing business in the Philippines pursuant to contracts executed abroad are income from sources within the Philippines and are subject to withholding tax under Sections 53 and 54 of the Tax Code. This was settled in *British Traders' Insurance Co., Ltd. v. CIR*.

2.  **NO.** The assessment has not prescribed. Where a deficiency assessment is based on an *amended* return which is "substantially different" from the original return, the prescriptive period for assessment is counted from the filing of the amended return, not the original. The original 1952 return declared a heavy loss that would have negated the deficiency, while the amended return (filed Aug. 30, 1955) substantially modified the data. Since the assessment was issued on July 24, 1958, it was well within the 5-year period under Section 331 of the Tax Code.

3.  **NO.** The deduction was not excessive. Although the formula used by Phoenix (40% of premiums) differed from the Insurance Law requirement (Sec. 186), the amount claimed was actually *less* than what the law required. A taxpayer is free to deduct a lesser amount than allowed by law; the law only prohibits claiming a deduction *beyond* the authorized amount.

4.  **NO.** The deduction for head office expenses must be based on income strictly applicable to the Philippines. Since items of income not belonging to the Philippine business (such as the ceded premiums) are not taxable to the Philippine branch, they must be excluded in determining the expenses allocable to said branch. The Court sustained the CIR's computation based on **net income** (excluding non-Philippine income), pursuant to Section 30(a)(2) of the Tax Code.

**Decision modified.** Phoenix Assurance Co., Ltd. is ordered to pay the assessed withholding taxes and deficiency income taxes, less the refund due for 1953.
