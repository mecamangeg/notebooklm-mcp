I. CAPTION
In the Matter of the Voluntary Dissolution of the Conjugal Partnership of Jose Bermas, Sr. and Pilar Manuel Bermas, G.R. No. L-20379, June 22, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Jose Bermas, Sr. and Pilar Manuel Bermas, married since 1932, executed an "Agreement for Dissolution of Conjugal Partnership and Separation of Property" on May 31, 1962 [1]. They filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zamboanga City seeking judicial approval of said agreement to prevent future friction among their heirs, noting that Jose had children from a previous marriage as well as children with Pilar [1]. The CFI denied the petition, ruling that under Article 192 of the Civil Code, a conjugal partnership could only be dissolved upon legal separation, civil interdiction, declaration of absence, or abandonment, and not merely by agreement [2]. The petitioners appealed. The Supreme Court observed that while the petition listed the spouses' common children, it failed to name or notify Jose’s children from his first marriage [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the conjugal partnership may be voluntarily dissolved by the spouses subject to judicial approval.
2. W/N the children from the husband's previous marriage must be personally notified of the dissolution proceedings.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the lower court erred in limiting dissolution to the causes in Article 192. Under the fourth paragraph of Article 191 of the Civil Code, spouses are explicitly allowed to agree upon the dissolution of the conjugal partnership during the marriage, subject to judicial approval [4].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the liquidation of the current conjugal partnership cannot be properly effected without liquidating the partnership from the husband's first marriage, in which the children of that marriage have a distinct interest [5]. Citing *Oñas v. Javillo*, the Court explained that under Article 189 of the Civil Code, doubt regarding partnership property is resolved by dividing it between the different partnerships proportionately [5]. Thus, to protect against substantial injury to their rights, it is essential that the children from the previous marriage be personally notified of the proceedings [5].

The decision appealed from was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings in conformity with the decision [6].
