I. CAPTION
FELICISIMA B. SALOMON v. HON. JOSE M. MENDOZA and JUAN ENGTIONG YU, G.R. No. L-23628, July 31, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Salomon and Respondent Yu disputed possession of a commercial lot in Cebu City owned by the Provincial Government. In a previous unlawful detainer case between them, the Court of First Instance (CFI) rendered a decision on February 21, 1961, dismissing the complaint against Salomon and ruling that she "can continue occupying the land as long as she pays monthly rental to the plaintiff" [1]. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals and became final [2, 3].

However, Salomon failed to pay rentals from October 1958 to June 1964 [4]. Consequently, upon Yu's motion for clarification, the respondent Judge issued an order on July 14, 1964, declaring that Salomon had forfeited her right to occupy the land due to her failure to pay rent as required by the judgment, and that Yu was entitled to possess the entire land [5, 6]. Salomon filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that the July 14 order constituted a substantial amendment of a final judgment and that the Judge exceeded his jurisdiction, contending that Yu should have filed an entirely new action for ejectment [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction by issuing an order declaring the petitioner's right to occupy forfeited for failure to pay rent, without requiring a new action for ejectment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the order did not substantially change or modify the final judgment. The 1961 judgment explicitly stated that the petitioner could continue occupying the land "as long as she pays monthly rental." The clear and necessary inference is that if she failed to pay, she could not continue occupying the land [7].

A judgment is not confined to what appears on its face but comprehends what is necessarily included therein or necessary thereto in order to make it effective, citing *Perez v. Evite* and *Unson v. Lacson* [7]. Accepting the petitioner's contention that a new ejectment action is required would render the express condition imposed by the court meaningless and allow her to refuse payment with impunity [7].

The petition was denied, and the injunction dissolved [8].
