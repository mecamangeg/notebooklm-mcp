I. CAPTION
THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS v. FELIX M. ICAMEN, G.R. No. L-12351, June 29, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Felix Icamen, a Captain in the Armed Forces of the Philippines assigned to the Philippine Mission in Tokyo, purchased a frigidaire and an electric range from the U.S. PX in Tokyo for personal use. He shipped these items to Manila on board the Philippine Navy vessel *R.P.S. Misamis Oriental*. Upon arrival on September 2, 1954, Customs officials seized the goods as unmanifested merchandise under Section 1363(g) of the Revised Administrative Code and for alleged violation of Central Bank Circular No. 45 regarding import licenses [1].

The Collector of Customs ordered the forfeiture of the goods, which was affirmed by the petitioner Commissioner of Customs. On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) reversed the decision and ordered the release of the goods upon payment of duties and taxes [1, 2]. The Commissioner petitioned the Supreme Court for review.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the goods are subject to forfeiture as unmanifested merchandise under Section 1363(g) of the Revised Administrative Code.
2. W/N the importation violated Central Bank Circular No. 45.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The goods were not unmanifested. The Supreme Court upheld the CTA's factual finding that there was an adequate manifest covering the goods on board the navy vessel *R.P.S. Misamis Oriental* [3]. Evidence showed that the Philippine Navy had prepared a manifest in compliance with its standing operating procedures and had even furnished copies to the Bureau of Customs upon the request of the Acting Commissioner [3, 4].

2. **NO.** The importation did not violate Central Bank Circular No. 45. The goods were purchased by the respondent while stationed abroad using dollars received as salary and allowances [4]. The Court held that these are not considered "imported goods" in the sense of goods purchased with money coming from the Philippines involving the sale of foreign exchange [4, 5]. Furthermore, the importation occurred before the enactment of Republic Act No. 1410 (the No-Dollar Import Law) [5].

**ACCORDINGLY**, the decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
