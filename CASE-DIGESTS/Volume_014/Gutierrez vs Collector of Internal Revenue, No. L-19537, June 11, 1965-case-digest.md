I. CAPTION
THE LATE LINO GUTIERREZ, substituted by ANDREA C. VDA. DE GUTIERREZ, et al. v. COLLECTOR (now COMMISSIONER) OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-19537, June 11, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On May 20, 1965, the Supreme Court promulgated a decision in this case regarding the tax liability of the late Lino Gutierrez and his heirs [1]. However, upon review, the Court discovered that the decision contained clerical mistakes in the mathematical computations of the amounts due [1]. The Court issued a Resolution to address these errors [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court may *motu proprio* correct clerical mistakes in mathematical computations in its decision.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that it may *motu proprio* correct its decision when it finds that clerical mistakes in the mathematical computation appear therein [1, 3]. Consequently, the Court modified the dispositive portion of its May 20, 1965 decision to reflect the accurate figures. The petitioners were ordered to pay deficiency income taxes of P1,132.00 for 1951, P845.00 for 1952, P5,341.00 for 1953, and P4,020.00 for 1954, for a total of P11,338.00, plus statutory penalties [4].
