I. CAPTION
BERNARDINO GUERRERO & ASSOCIATE v. FRANCISCO TAN, G.R. Nos. L-20824, L-21819 & L-22218, June 24, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent-executor Francisco Tan engaged petitioner Bernardino Guerrero & Associate as counsel for the testate estate of Tan Chiong Pun. No specific fee was stipulated. The lawyers rendered services for over five years, which included probating the will, handling the administration of the "Mabuhay Subdivision" (collecting rentals, dealing with buyers/tenants), and resolving disputes with heirs and the BIR [1, 2]. The estate was finally assessed at P1,838,068.83 [1].

Initially, the lower court fixed the attorney’s fees at 15% of the estate’s market value (~P275,000) [3]. Upon the executor's motion, the court reduced the fees to P40,000, ruling the previous amount excessive [4]. Both parties appealed: the lawyers claimed 15%, while the executor argued the P15,000 already paid was sufficient [5]. During the appeal, the executor terminated the petitioners' services due to the fee dispute, and new counsel entered an appearance, which the petitioners moved to strike out (L-22218) [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the attorney's fees fixed by the lower court at P40,000 were reasonable.
2. W/N the substitution of counsel was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the award of P40,000 was too parsimonious. In fixing attorney's fees in probate cases, the court considers: (1) the value of the estate; (2) the professional standing of the attorney; (3) the extent of services rendered; and (4) the time consumed which deprived counsel of other profitable work [5, 7]. Here, the estate was worth over P1.8 million, and counsel (a bar examiner and practitioner since 1919) handled not just the probate but the tedious administration of a subdivision for six years [5]. Citing *David v. Sison*, the Court ruled that counsel is entitled to adequate compensation for strict attention to numerous details. The fees were increased to P100,000 [5].

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the order denying the motion to strike the appearance of new counsel [8]. Since the executor lost confidence in the petitioners and terminated their services, it would be unfair to require dismissed counsel to continue [9]. However, since the termination occurred before the proceedings ended, the Court ruled that the petitioners' fees must be paid in full immediately, without waiting for the final termination of the estate proceedings [9].

Accordingly, the order fixing fees is MODIFIED to P100,000, and the order respecting the substitution of counsel is AFFIRMED [8, 9].
