I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. MANILA SURETY & FIDELITY CO., INC. and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-20567, July 30, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Philippine National Bank (PNB) advanced funds to Edgington Oil Refinery for asphalt, 2,000 tons of which were delivered to Adams & Taguba Corporation (ATACO) under a trust receipt. This was guaranteed by Manila Surety & Fidelity Co., Inc. (Manila Surety) up to P75,000.00. To pay for the asphalt, ATACO executed an assignment constituting PNB as its assignee and irrevocable attorney-in-fact to collect payments due to ATACO from the Bureau of Public Works (BPW) [1, 2]. PNB collected regularly from BPW for several months in 1948 but subsequently ceased collecting for unexplained reasons. In 1952, PNB discovered that other creditors had collected the remaining funds from BPW [3]. PNB filed a suit to recover the balance. The trial court ordered ATACO and Manila Surety to pay, but the Court of Appeals reversed the decision regarding Manila Surety, holding that PNB was negligent in failing to collect the funds, thereby releasing the surety [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Manila Surety was released from liability due to PNB's negligence in collecting the assigned funds.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision. PNB was negligent not in failing to collect from the principal debtor (ATACO), but in failing to collect the sums due to ATACO from the BPW, contrary to its duty as the holder of an exclusive and irrevocable power of attorney [6]. Under Article 1887 of the Civil Code, an agent is required to act with the care of a good father of a family, and under Article 1884, the agent is liable for damages the principal may suffer through non-performance [6]. By allowing the assigned funds to be exhausted by other creditors without notifying the surety, PNB deprived Manila Surety of any possibility of recourse against that security. Consequently, under Article 2080 of the Civil Code, the surety is released from its obligation because the creditor's act prevented subrogation to the rights and preferences of the latter [7].

The appealed decision is affirmed [8].
