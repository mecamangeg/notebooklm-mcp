I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION AS CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. ANTONIO UY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-20208, June 30, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Antonio Uy filed a petition for naturalization, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Cebu [1, 2]. The Solicitor General appealed the decision on two grounds: lack of lucrative income and failure to state all former places of residence [2]. Uy's income tax returns showed an annual salary of P2,400 for 1959, P2,975 for 1960, and P3,600 for 1961, alongside fluctuating bonuses [2]. Regarding residence, evidence established that Uy had lived in Tagbilaran, Bohol, and various streets in Cebu City (Echague, Colon, and Tres de Abril), yet his petition only listed Cabalia-an, Leyte as his former residence [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative income.
2. W/N the failure to allege all former places of residence is fatal to the petition.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that a yearly income of P3,600 (or P300 a month) is not considered lucrative, taking into account the high cost of living and the low purchasing value of the peso [4]. Furthermore, bonuses should not be taken into consideration in determining the lucrativeness of an alien's income because they are not uniform and depend entirely on the profits of the employing company [2].

2. **YES.** Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law requires a petition to set forth all present and former places of residence [3]. The purpose of this requirement is to facilitate the investigation of the petitioner's moral character and activities by private individuals or government agencies in the localities where he resided [3]. Uy's failure to state his former residences in Tagbilaran, Bohol, and specific streets in Cebu City violated the law, rendering his petition incomplete and fatally defective [3].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is dismissed [5].
