I. CAPTION
CALTEX (PHILIPPINES), INC. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-20462, June 30, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In 1958 and 1959, Caltex (Philippines), Inc. imported various machinery and spare parts [1]. The Collector of Customs of Manila levied a special import tax under Republic Act No. 1394 on these importations [1]. This special import tax was included in the landed cost of the goods, which served as the basis for computing the compensating tax, all of which Caltex paid [1]. Caltex filed protests with the Collector of Customs, arguing it was exempt from the special import tax under Section 6 of R.A. No. 1394 [1], [2].

Claiming that the inclusion of the special import tax resulted in an overpayment of the compensating tax, Caltex filed a claim for refund with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) [1]. Fearing the expiration of the two-year prescriptive period under the Tax Code, Caltex filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) without awaiting the CIR's decision [1]. However, at the time of filing, the Collector of Customs had not yet acted on the protests regarding the special import tax [2]. The CTA dismissed the petition without prejudice, ruling that the question of exemption fell within the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Customs and had not yet been resolved [3], [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CTA has jurisdiction to review the claim for refund while the protest regarding the special import tax is still pending with the Collector of Customs.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the petition. Although the petition sought a refund of compensating taxes (an internal revenue tax), the Court held that the case was effectively a claim for exemption from the special import tax under R.A. No. 1394 [5]. Since R.A. No. 1394 is administered by the Bureau of Customs, issues involving liability or exemption are governed by the Tariff and Customs Code [5], [6].

Under Section 2313 of the Tariff and Customs Code, an appeal to the Commissioner of Customs requires an adverse ruling from the Collector of Customs [7]. Since the Collector had not yet acted on Caltex's protests, there was no decision to appeal to the Commissioner of Customs [7]. Furthermore, under Section 7(2) of R.A. No. 1125 and Section 2402 of R.A. No. 1937, the CTA only has jurisdiction to review decisions of the Commissioner of Customs [7], [8], [9]. In the absence of such a decision, the CTA had no case to take cognizance of, making the petition premature [9].

The Resolution appealed from is affirmed [10].
