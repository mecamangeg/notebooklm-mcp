I. CAPTION
DR. POLICARPIO C. ALISOSO v. TARCELA LASTIMOSO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19659, May 31, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Dr. Policarpio Alisoso filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu to strike out his name from the birth record of the minor Leonilo Lastimoso in the Local Civil Registry of Pinamungajan, Cebu. The birth record, reported by one Lucila O. Lastimoso, listed Petitioner as the father. However, Tarcela Lastimoso, the child's mother, executed an affidavit stating she did not authorize the registration, nor did she or Petitioner consent to it. She further attested that Lucila was a mere interloper with no authority to report the birth. Petitioner denied any amorous relations with Tarcela and proved he was married to another woman. The Solicitor General moved to dismiss, arguing that under Article 412 of the Civil Code, only clerical errors can be corrected summarily, whereas this petition involved a substantial change affecting paternity and filiation. The CFI granted the petition, ordering the cancellation of Petitioner's name. The Government appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may order the cancellation of the Petitioner's name from the civil registry despite the objection that it involves a substantial change in status.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the order of the CFI. The Court reasoned that the facts were undisputed: Petitioner is not the father, he had no amorous relations with the mother, and the informant (Lucila) was an unauthorized interloper. The Court applied the doctrine in *Roces v. Local Civil Registrar of Manila* (G.R. No. L-10598), holding that when a birth certificate identifying a father is executed without his signature or consent, the statements therein are an "open violation of the law" (Act No. 3753 and Art. 280, Civil Code). Consequently, the Local Civil Registrar has no authority to record such unlawful entries. Since the entry regarding Petitioner's paternity was false, unauthorized, and null and void, the Court held it must be cancelled or corrected. The order appealed from is affirmed.
