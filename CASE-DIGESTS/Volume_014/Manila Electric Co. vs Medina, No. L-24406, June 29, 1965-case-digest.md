I. CAPTION
MANILA ELECTRIC COMPANY v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONER ENRIQUE MEDINA, ASSOCIATE COMMISSIONERS, REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, and CITY OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-24406, June 29, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On October 22, 1964, the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) applied with the Public Service Commission (PSC) for a rate increase. On March 15, 1965, the PSC rendered a decision approving the increase, albeit at a reduced rate compared to the application, and expressly stated that the increases "shall be effective from the date of this decision." On March 18, 1965, the Solicitor General filed a motion for reconsideration and an *ex parte* motion to suspend the effectivity of the decision. On March 19, 1965, without notice to Meralco or a hearing, Respondent Commissioner Medina issued an order suspending the effectivity of the rate increase. Meralco’s motions to hear its opposition were ignored, and Medina issued further orders delaying the hearing of the motions for reconsideration. Meralco filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Supreme Court [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Public Service Commission has the authority to suspend the effectivity of its orders prescribing rates.
2. W/N the issuance of the suspension order *ex parte* violated due process.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Section 33 of the Public Service Law explicitly states that all orders of the Commission prescribing rates "shall be immediately operative." The law confers no discretion upon the Commission to suspend the effectivity of such orders [5]. Furthermore, Section 37 of the same Act grants the power to stay or suspend Commission orders exclusively to the Supreme Court [6, 7]. The power to reconsider orders does not imply the power to suspend their effectivity pending reconsideration [7].

2. **YES.** The suspension order was issued upon an *ex parte* motion without giving Meralco, the party adversely affected, an opportunity to oppose it or present its side. This constituted a denial of due process [8]. Since the original decision conferred valuable rights effective immediately, the suspension order effectively amended that decision; such amendments cannot be made without notice and hearing [9]. The due process clause binds all branches and instrumentalities of the government, including administrative bodies like the PSC [9].

The petition is GRANTED. The PSC order of March 19, 1965, is declared null and void, and the Commission is directed to immediately hear and resolve the motions for reconsideration [10].
