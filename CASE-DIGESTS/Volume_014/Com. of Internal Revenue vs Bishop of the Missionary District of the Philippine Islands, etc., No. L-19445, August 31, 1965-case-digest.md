I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. BISHOP OF THE MISSIONARY DISTRICT OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS OF THE PROTESTANT EPISCOPAL CHURCH IN THE U.S.A. and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-19445, August 31, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
The Missionary District of the Philippine Islands (Missionary District), a duly incorporated religious society, received shipments of materials, supplies, and equipment from the Missionary Society in the United States and a stove from a donor in Canada [1, 2]. These items were intended for the construction and operation of St. Luke’s Hospital, Brent Hospital, and St. Stephen’s High School [1]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) levied and collected P118,847.00 as compensating tax on these shipments [3]. The Bishop filed a claim for refund, asserting exemption under Republic Act No. 1916, and subsequently filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [3]. The CTA ruled in favor of the Bishop and ordered the refund [4]. The CIR appealed, arguing that the shipments were not donations because the Missionary District and Missionary Society are the same entity, and that St. Luke's Hospital is not a charitable institution because it admits pay patients, citing Department of Finance Order No. 18 [5-7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the shipments constitute tax-exempt donations under R.A. No. 1916 despite the relationship between the Missionary District and the Missionary Society.
2. W/N St. Luke’s Hospital qualifies as a charitable institution exempt from tax despite admitting paying patients.
3. W/N Department Order No. 18 validly limits the tax exemption for hospitals admitting pay patients.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The shipments qualify as tax-exempt donations. The Court held that the Missionary District and the Missionary Society are entities separate and distinct from each other, despite the former being a branch of the latter in matters of faith and dogma [2]. The requisites for exemption under R.A. No. 1916 were met: (1) the articles were donated; (2) the donee is a duly incorporated religious society; and (3) the articles were for the use of the institution [8].
2. **YES.** St. Luke's Hospital is a charitable institution. The admission of pay patients does not detract from the charitable character of a hospital provided that its funds are devoted exclusively to the maintenance of the institution [9]. The Court relied on the doctrine in *Herrera v. Quezon City Board of Assessment Appeals* [9].
3. **NO.** The Secretary of Finance cannot limit or qualify the enjoyment of the exemption granted by the legislature in R.A. No. 1916 through administrative regulations [9]. Department Order No. 18, which excluded hospitals admitting pay patients from the exemption, is invalid for restricting the law [9].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED [10].
