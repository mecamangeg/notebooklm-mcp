I. CAPTION
*In the Matter of the Petition of Saturnino Uy to be Admitted a Citizen of the Philippines. Saturnino Dy v. Republic of the Philippines*, G.R. No. L-20482, August 31, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Saturnino Dy filed a petition for naturalization, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of La Union [1, 2]. The Republic appealed the decision on two grounds: first, that the lower court lacked jurisdiction because there was no proof that the petition and notice of hearing were posted in the Clerk of Court's office; and second, that Dy failed to prove he possessed a lucrative trade or occupation [2].

Evidence showed that at the time of filing in 1960, Dy’s annual income was P3,600.00 (average of P300.00 a month) assisting in his father’s tobacco business [3]. His father died in May 1960, leaving Dy, the eldest child, to manage the business and support his mother and siblings [3]. Dy later presented a 1961 income tax return showing higher income, but this was submitted only after the trial court had already rendered its decision [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court acquired jurisdiction despite the initial absence of proof regarding the posting of the petition and notice.
2. W/N the petitioner satisfied the requirement of having a lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the absence of proof regarding the posting is not fatal to the application. Under Section 9 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, posting is the specific duty of the Clerk of Court [4]. The Court applied the presumption that official duty was duly performed [4]. Additionally, the Clerk of Court subsequently certified—albeit after the lower court's decision—that the required posting had actually been done [4].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that an income of P3,600.00 per year (P300.00 per month) is insufficient to meet the "lucrative trade" requirement, particularly given the diminished purchasing power of the currency and Dy's obligation to support his mother and siblings [3]. The Court emphasized that the requirement of lucrative trade refers to the financial status at the **time of the filing of the petition** [3]. Therefore, the increased income shown in Dy's 1961 tax return could not be considered to cure the deficiency [3].

The judgment appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DENIED** [5].
