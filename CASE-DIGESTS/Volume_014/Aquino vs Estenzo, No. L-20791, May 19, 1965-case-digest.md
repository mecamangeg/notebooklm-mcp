I. CAPTION
MANUEL F. AQUINO and FELIX PIRANTE v. THE HON. NUMERIANO G. ESTENZO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Leyte, Fifth Br. and MARCIANO S. DU, City Attorney, Ormoc City, G.R. No. L-20791, May 19, 1965, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Aquino and Pirante were charged with grave coercion in the City Court of Ormoc (Criminal Case No. 5640) [1]. The City Court took cognizance of the case under its concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of First Instance (CFI) pursuant to Sec. 87(c) of Republic Act No. 296 [1]. Petitioners were convicted and filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA), manifesting that no stenographic notes were taken during the trial as there was no stenographer [2, 3].

Instead of transmitting the records to the CA, the Clerk of Court forwarded them to the CFI of Leyte. The City Attorney then filed a new information for the same offense in the CFI (Criminal Case No. 1415-O) [3]. Petitioners filed a Motion to Quash, arguing the CFI lacked appellate jurisdiction because the appeal was directed to the CA [4]. Respondent Judge Estenzo denied the motion [5]. Without filing a Motion for Reconsideration, petitioners filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CFI of Leyte has jurisdiction to try the new information filed by the City Attorney.
2. W/N the petition for certiorari is proper despite the failure to file a Motion for Reconsideration.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the proceedings in the City Court were null and void for lack of record [6]. Under Sec. 87(c) of R.A. 296, when a city court exercises concurrent jurisdiction over offenses like grave coercion (punishable by *arresto mayor* and fine), it acts as a CFI and its decisions are appealable directly to the CA or Supreme Court [6, 7]. However, the law explicitly requires that "proceedings had shall be recorded" [8]. Since the trial was not recorded, the City Court did not exercise its jurisdiction in accordance with law, rendering the proceedings void [9, 10]. Consequently, there was no valid decision to appeal to the CA [11]. The City Attorney properly filed a new information in the CFI, and the CFI took cognizance of the case in the exercise of its *original*, not appellate, jurisdiction [12].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the failure to file a Motion for Reconsideration was a "fatal defect" [13, 14]. It is a settled rule that before filing a petition for certiorari, the attention of the lower court must first be called to its supposed error through a motion for reconsideration to allow it an opportunity to correct itself [14].

Petition denied; writ of preliminary injunction dissolved [15].
