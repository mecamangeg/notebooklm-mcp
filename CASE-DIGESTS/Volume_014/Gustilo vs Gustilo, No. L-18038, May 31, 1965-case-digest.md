I. CAPTION
ROSA GUSTILO v. AUGUSTO GUSTILO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18038, May 31, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rosa Gustilo filed an action in November 1952, following the death of Calixto Gustilo in May 1952, to annul a deed of sale executed by Calixto and his wife in favor of their legitimate children, and to claim her share in the estate as an acknowledged natural daughter [1]. Rosa claimed she was born in 1898 to Calixto and Teodora Soqueno, who were free to marry [2]. She lived with Calixto’s family for 15 years, was supported in her studies, and was treated as a family member [2].

To prove her status, she presented: (1) her marriage certificate listing Calixto as her father; (2) a letter from Calixto addressing her and his legitimate daughter Josefa as "queridas hijas" (dear daughters); (3) letters from Calixto’s legitimate son, Augusto, calling her "sister"; and (4) a Deed of Donation executed by Calixto in her favor, wherein she renounced her hereditary rights [3-5]. The Court of Appeals ruled against Rosa, noting she was precluded from filing an action for *compulsory* recognition as she was already 54 years old when Calixto died, and the documents did not constitute *voluntary* recognition [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the documents presented (marriage certificate, personal letters, and deed of donation) constitute a valid voluntary recognition of a natural child under Article 278 of the New Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. The Court held that under Article 278 of the New Civil Code (and Article 131 of the Spanish Civil Code), recognition must be made in the record of birth, a will, a statement before a court of record, or in any authentic writing [6].

1.  **Marriage Certificate:** The certificate was not signed by Calixto; thus, it is not an act of the alleged parent [7, 8].
2.  **Letters:** The letter addressing Rosa as "hija" is insufficient. In Filipino homes, it is common to address a stranger treated as a family member as "hija" or "hijo." Citing *Joaquin v. Joaquin* and Manresa, the Court ruled that recognition must be deliberate and express; the incidental use of the title "daughter" in personal letters does not satisfy the legal requirement [9-11].
3.  **Deed of Donation:** The donation, given in exchange for Rosa's renunciation of inheritance rights, indicates that Calixto *did not* wish to recognize her. It was likely a compromise to avoid a suit. While it might imply a tacit admission of status, it is not the *express* and *voluntary* acknowledgment required by law [12-14].

The petition was denied, and the decision affirmed [15].
