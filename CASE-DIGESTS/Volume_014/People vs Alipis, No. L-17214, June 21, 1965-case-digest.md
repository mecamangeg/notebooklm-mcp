I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CIRIACO ALIPIS, G.R. No. L-17214, June 21, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On October 15, 1957, in Atimonan, Quezon, Captain Apolonio Pagsuberon, Commanding Officer of the 2nd Battalion Combat Team, was found dead at the bottom of a cliff with a gunshot wound to the head. Sgt. Ciriaco Alipis, who had reported the Captain missing earlier that morning, was charged with murder along with Sgt. Enrique Lloren and others. The prosecution relied entirely on circumstantial evidence, alleging inter alia that Alipis was the first to report the disappearance, that he had bloodstains on his pants, and that he allegedly exchanged gun parts with Lloren to hide evidence. The Court of First Instance of Quezon convicted Alipis of murder and sentenced him to death, while acquitting co-accused Lloren. Alipis appealed, challenging the sufficiency of the circumstantial evidence.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the circumstantial evidence presented is sufficient to warrant a conviction for murder.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the judgment and acquitted Alipis. Under Section 5, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court, circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction only if: (a) there is more than one circumstance; (b) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (c) the combination of all circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.

The Court found that the "series of circumstances" cited by the trial court did not constitute an unbroken chain leading to the appellant's guilt. Key evidences pointed away from Alipis: his paraffin test was negative, while the acquitted co-accused Lloren tested positive; ballistics tests linked Lloren’s pistol, not Alipis’s, to the crime scene; and other suspects (like Sgt. Tredente) exhibited more suspicious behavior. The Court held that an accused cannot be convicted upon circumstantial evidence that does not link him conclusively to the crime and instead points to other suspects. Consequently, the prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

The judgment of the lower court is **REVERSED** and Ciriaco Alipis is **ACQUITTED**.
