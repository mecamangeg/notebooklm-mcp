**I. CAPTION**
MARSMAN & CO., INC., ET AL. v. LEOPOLDO SYQUIA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19207, August 31, 1965, 14 SCRA 896, Bengzon, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiffs (Mary A. Marsman group) and defendants (Leopoldo Syquia group) were engaged in a struggle for control over Marsman & Co., Inc. and Marsman Investments Ltd. The conflict escalated after Marsman Investments Ltd. transferred 2.5 million shares to Mary A. Marsman, giving her majority control [1], [2]. The Syquia group organized Arayat Corporation, solicited proxies, and succeeded in passing a resolution to annul the sale during a stockholders' meeting [2], [3]. Consequently, multiple civil cases were filed in Rizal, Manila, and Davao courts involving proxy disputes, disqualification of officers, and inspection of corporate books [1], [4]. Claiming the litigation was oppressive and interminable, plaintiffs filed a specific suit in the Court of First Instance of Rizal to enjoin defendants from filing or prosecuting further actions [5]. The trial court denied the relief, prompting this appeal [6], [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the court should intervene in equity to restrain the defendants from filing or prosecuting litigations related to the corporate control struggle.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that equity will not intervene to restrain litigations that are incidents of a struggle for the control and management of a corporation when conducted within the frame of corporation rules and in accordance with usual court procedures [7], [8].

The Court found that the pending cases were not merely harassment. Some were filed by the plaintiffs themselves, while others—such as the *quo warranto* proceedings and suits for inspection of books—were exercises of stockholder rights or appeared *prima facie* tenable [9], [8]. The fact that one side will eventually win does not imply the other is actuated by illegal motives warranting a halt to litigation [8]. Furthermore, the plaintiffs had sufficient legal remedies, such as invoking the rule on the pendency of another action (*lis pendens*), without resorting to special equitable powers [10].

**Order confirmed.**
