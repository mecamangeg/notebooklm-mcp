I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. EUGENIO LIBED and MARCELINO LIBED, G.R. No. L-20431, June 23, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On February 20, 1959, in Bautista, Pangasinan, Mariano Ringor was planting corn when his carabao went wild and entered the land of brothers Eugenio and Marcelino Libed. Ringor pursued the animal onto their land. As he passed by, Eugenio and Marcelino clubbed him with pieces of *ipil* wood used for planting, continuing to beat him even after he fell. Ringor died of cerebral hemorrhage. Eugenio surrendered to the authorities, admitting he clubbed the victim but claiming self-defense against Ringor who allegedly chased him with a bolo. Marcelino fled and later claimed alibi, stating he was plowing land 200 meters away. The Court of First Instance convicted both of murder and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua*. The appellants challenged the credibility of the prosecution witnesses, who were relatives or suitors of the victim's daughter.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the witnesses' relationship to the victim destroys their credibility.
2. W/N Eugenio Libed proved self-defense.
3. W/N Marcelino Libed's defense of alibi is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The fact of relationship to the victim alone does not destroy a witness' credibility. It is not to be lightly supposed that relatives of the deceased would callously violate their conscience to avenge the death of a dear one by blaming it on innocent persons [1].

2. **NO.** When an accused admits killing the deceased, it is incumbent upon him to prove the plea of self-defense by clear and convincing evidence. Eugenio failed to adduce such proof. His claim that he parried a bolo blow with the wood is belied by the absence of deep cuts on the wood [2]. Furthermore, he is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, which lowers his penalty [3].

3. **NO.** Marcelino was positively identified by eyewitnesses as having hit the deceased. Alibi cannot prosper in the face of positive identification, especially when it was not physically impossible for him to be at the scene, being only 200 meters away [4].

**judgment AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.** Eugenio Libed's penalty is lowered to an indeterminate sentence of 10 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 17 years, 4 months and 1 day of *reclusion temporal* due to voluntary surrender. The indemnity is raised to P6,000.00. Marcelino Libed's sentence of *reclusion perpetua* stands [5].
