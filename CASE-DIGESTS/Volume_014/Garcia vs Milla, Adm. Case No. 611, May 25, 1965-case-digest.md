I. CAPTION
BONIFACIO GARCIA, LORENZO AGUSTIN, CLEMENTE AGACETE and PEDRO SANTIAGO v. ATTY. ABELARDO MILLA, Adm. Case No. 611, May 25, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners sought the disbarment or suspension of respondent Atty. Abelardo Milla, the Assistant Provincial Fiscal of Tarlac. They alleged that Milla used his office as an instrument of revenge and coercion by aiding his father-in-law, Gaudencio Toledo, and the heirs of Cosme Valdez in forcibly taking possession of disputed land and harvesting palay on February 18 and 19, 1964, accompanied by armed men and Constabulary soldiers [1-3].

The matter was referred to the Department of Justice for investigation. Senior State Prosecutor Vicente Orendain found that the land was titled to Cosme Valdez, while petitioners held no title [4]. The investigation revealed that petitioners had hired armed men led by one Camilo Molacruz to seize the harvest [5, 6]. Respondent Milla went to the premises on February 19, 1964, not to harass, but to drive away these "goons" threatening the peace [7]. The investigator concluded that Milla's inclusion in the charges was merely an afterthought by the petitioners to leverage their position in the agrarian dispute [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Atty. Milla should be disbarred or suspended for his actions in the land dispute.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, adopting the findings of the investigator. The evidence showed that the respondent was merely performing his duty as a public prosecutor to protect law-abiding citizens from undue harassment by the petitioners' hired men [9]. Acts of a public prosecutor in the fulfillment of his duty to maintain peace and order are not grounds for disbarment [10].

Petition dismissed [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Makalintal, and Bengzon, J.P. concurred. Justices Regala and Zaldivar took no part [11].
