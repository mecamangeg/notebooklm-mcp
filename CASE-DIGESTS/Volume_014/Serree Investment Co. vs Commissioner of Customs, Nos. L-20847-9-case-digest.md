I. CAPTION
SERREE INVESTMENT COMPANY v. COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. Nos. L-20847-9, June 22, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Serree Investment Company was the consignee of three shipments from Hong Kong—melon seeds, fresh liches, and candles—which arrived between 1954 and 1955. The shipments did not have the Central Bank (CB) release certificates required by CB Circulars Nos. 44 and 45. Consequently, the shipments were seized by the Collector of Customs pursuant to Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code (RAC). Petitioner filed surety bonds to secure their release. Seizure proceedings resulted in the Collector ordering the forfeiture of the merchandise and the payment of the bonds. The Commissioner of Customs and the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the forfeiture. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the CB lacked the power to issue the circulars regarding "no-dollar" imports and that the enactment of Republic Act No. 1410 (No-Dollar Import Law) nullified said circulars.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Central Bank has the authority to issue Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 regarding no-dollar imports.
2. W/N the goods are subject to forfeiture under Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Central Bank has the authority to issue Circulars Nos. 44 and 45. Under Section 74 of Republic Act No. 265, the Monetary Board is authorized to subject all transactions in gold and foreign exchange to licensing to protect the international reserve. The Court reiterated its ruling in *Commissioner of Customs v. Serree Investment Company* (L-12007), holding that these circulars are valid measures to check the unregulated flow of foreign exchange. Furthermore, the Court held that Republic Act No. 1410 did not nullify these circulars.

2. **YES.** Merchandise imported in violation of CB Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 constitutes "merchandise of prohibited importation" under Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code. Because the importations were made without the necessary release certificates, they were effected "contrary to law" and are liable to seizure and forfeiture in favor of the Government.

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED.
