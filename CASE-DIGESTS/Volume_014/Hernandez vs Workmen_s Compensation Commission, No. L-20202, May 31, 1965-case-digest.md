I. CAPTION
CIRIACO HERNANDEZ v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and MANILA ELECTRIC COMPANY, G.R. No. L-20202, May 31, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ciriaco Hernandez was employed by respondent Manila Electric Company (MERALCO) as an automotive mechanic in 1930. On January 15, 1953, after 23 years of service, he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) but continued working while receiving treatment from the company physician. MERALCO scheduled his compulsory retirement for December 31, 1959, pursuant to company policy. However, due to his weakened bodily condition caused by PTB, Hernandez requested and was granted early retirement on November 25, 1959—36 days ahead of schedule. He filed a claim for compensation in March 1960.

The Hearing Officer of the Department of Labor ruled in favor of Hernandez, awarding him P4,000.00 in disability compensation. On appeal, the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed this decision, reasoning that the fact that 23 years elapsed before the disease appeared suggested it did not arise out of employment. Hernandez appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner's illness is compensable despite appearing only after 23 years of employment.
2. W/N the claim for compensation was barred by late filing.
3. W/N disability compensation extends beyond the date of the employee's compulsory retirement.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that once a disease is shown to have arisen in the course of employment, the law presumes, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, that it arose out of it. The fact that 23 years elapsed before the disease appeared is not substantial evidence to rebut this presumption; it merely proves that the deterioration of the laborer's health caused by working conditions was slow (*Agustin v. WCC*).

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that MERALCO dispensed with the need for a Notice of Sickness under Section 24 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act by voluntarily furnishing medical services. Furthermore, although the formal claim was filed after the two-month period, the petitioner's request for early retirement on November 25, 1959, predicated on sickness, substantially fulfilled the requirement of a claim. This prevents the employer from pleading surprise, which is the primary reason for the notice requirement (*Luzon Stevedoring Co., Inc. v. WCC*).

3. **NO.** Compensation payments are premised on the loss or impairment of earning capacity due to illness. Since Hernandez was scheduled for compulsory retirement on December 31, 1959, his earning capacity would have ended on that date regardless of his illness. Therefore, compensation is limited to the period of his disability prior to the compulsory retirement date (November 25 to December 31, 1959). This is distinct from medical benefits, which subsist until the illness is cured or arrested (*Itogon-Suyoc Mines, Inc. v. Dulay*).

The decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is **REVERSED**, and MERALCO is ordered to pay petitioner compensation of P35.00 per week for the period from November 25, 1959 to December 31, 1959, exclusive of the first three days.
