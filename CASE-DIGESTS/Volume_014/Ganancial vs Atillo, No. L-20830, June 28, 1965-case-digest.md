I. CAPTION
HILARIO GANANCIAL and PEOPLE’S HOMESITE AND HOUSING CORPORATION v. LEONARDO ATILLO, G.R. No. L-20830, June 28, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On April 24, 1961, petitioner Hilario Ganancial filed a complaint for Forcible Entry against respondent Leonardo Atillo in the Municipal Court of Quezon City, later amending it to implead the People’s Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC) [1]. The complaint alleged that on February 6, 1960, Atillo entered and occupied the subject lot through "strategy, stealth and force" [2]. The Municipal Court ruled in favor of the petitioners, ordering Atillo to vacate [3].

Atillo appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal. He filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the Municipal Court lacked jurisdiction because more than one year had elapsed from the date of dispossession (February 6, 1960) to the filing of the complaint (April 24, 1961) [3, 4]. The CFI initially rendered judgment modifying the rental amount but, upon Atillo's Motion for Reconsideration, set aside its decision and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. The CFI held that since the entry was effected by force and intimidation on a specific date known to the plaintiffs, the one-year period began on that date, not from the demand to vacate [4-7]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the period should be counted from the date of the demand to vacate [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the one-year period for filing a forcible entry case should be counted from the date of demand to vacate rather than the date of actual entry when the entry was effected by force and intimidation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the commencement of the one-year period is the very date of illegal entry when the ground for dispossession is force, violence, or intimidation [9].

The Court distinguished between entry by **force or violence** and entry by **stealth**. In cases of stealth, the intruder conceals the trespass, so the one-year period counts from the demand or discovery to prevent rewarding clandestine usurpations [9]. However, in cases of force or intimidation, the lawful possessor is immediately aware of the dispossession. Here, the complaint alleged that Atillo occupied the premises on February 6, 1960, by means of force, intimidation, and threat; thus, the petitioners knew of the dispossession on that date [9].

Since the complaint was filed on April 24, 1961—more than one year after the entry on February 6, 1960—the Municipal Court lacked jurisdiction [9]. When an inferior court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, the CFI's only authority on appeal is to dismiss the case, unless the parties agree to the CFI's original jurisdiction, which the respondent contest here [10].

Appeal dismissed [11].
