I. CAPTION
KAPISANAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA SA MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. HON. JESUS DE VEYRA, MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and BENGUET AUTO LINES EMPLOYEES UNION, G.R. No. L-17650, June 22, 1965, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Kapisanan ng mga Manggagawa sa Manila Railroad Company (Kapisanan) had an existing collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with respondent Manila Railroad Company (MRRCO). Respondent Benguet Auto Lines Employees Union (BALEU) filed a petition for injunction with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Baguio, presided by Judge De Veyra, to restrain MRRCO from enforcing the CBA's union security clause, which required the dismissal of non-Kapisanan members. Kapisanan intervened and moved to dismiss the CFI case, arguing that the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) had jurisdiction due to a pending Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charge involving the same matter filed earlier. Judge De Veyra denied the motion to dismiss, ruling that the formal ULP complaint was filed in the CIR only after the injunction case was filed in the CFI. Kapisanan filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court questioning the CFI's jurisdiction. During the pendency of the case, the CBA expired, BALEU won the certification election becoming the exclusive bargaining representative, and the ULP case in the CIR was dismissed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for certiorari has become moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the case had become moot and academic due to supervening events. The Court found that the CBA in question expired on November 5, 1960, and BALEU was subsequently certified as the sole bargaining representative of the employees [1]. Furthermore, the ULP case (Case No. 2449-ULP), which served as the basis for the petitioner's claim of jurisdiction in the CIR, was dismissed on September 26, 1961 [2].

The Court applied the principle that where records show that during the pendency of a case, certain events or circumstances take place which render the issues theoretical, the petition for certiorari will be dismissed [3, 4]. Since the questioned CBA provisions were no longer enforceable and the ULP case was terminated, resolving the jurisdictional dispute between the CFI and CIR would be purely academic [4].

Petition dismissed.
