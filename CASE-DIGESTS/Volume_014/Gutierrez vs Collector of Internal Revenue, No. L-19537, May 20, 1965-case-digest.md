**I. CAPTION**
**LINO GUTIERREZ (substituted by ANDREA C. VDA. DE GUTIERREZ, et al.) v. COLLECTOR (now COMMISSIONER) OF INTERNAL REVENUE**, G.R. No. L-19537, May 20, 1965, J.P. Bengzon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Lino Gutierrez was engaged in the business of leasing real property. For the tax years 1951 to 1954, he filed his income tax returns and paid the declared taxes. On July 10, 1956, the Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed deficiency income taxes against him. The assessment resulted from the disallowance of various deductions (funeral expenses, residence repairs, car expenses, litigation fees, etc.) and the treatment of profits from real estate sales. Specifically, for a property bought in 1943 and sold in 1953, the CIR used the Ballantyne Scale to convert the acquisition cost from Japanese notes to Commonwealth pesos, resulting in a taxable profit instead of Gutierrez's claimed loss. The CIR also treated properties sold in 1953 and 1954 as ordinary assets rather than capital assets.

Gutierrez appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), which upheld the CIR's assessment *in toto*. Gutierrez (later substituted by his heirs) appealed to the Supreme Court, raising issues regarding the deductions, the classification of assets, the use of the Ballantyne Scale, and the prescription of the CIR's right to collect taxes.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the claimed deductions for funeral expenses, home improvements, and fines are allowable business expenses.
2. W/N expenses for car maintenance, repairs on rental apartments, and litigation to collect rentals are deductible.
3. W/N the Ballantyne Scale of Values applies in determining the acquisition cost of property bought during the Japanese occupation and sold after the war.
4. W/N real properties used in the taxpayer's trade or business are capital assets.
5. W/N the government's right to collect the tax has prescribed.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** Personal, living, or family expenses are not deductible under Section 31(a)(1) of the Tax Code. Transportation to attend funerals, installation of an iron door in the residence, and depreciation of a residence not used in business are personal expenses [1], [2]. Furthermore, fines and penalties for late tax payments are not deductible as they would defeat the prescribed punishment, and charitable contributions to individuals not specified by law are disallowed [2], [3].

2. **YES.** Expenses shown to be made in pursuit of business, such as commissions and convention expenses, are deductible [4]. For the car used for both personal and business needs, 50% of the expenses are allowed [5]. Repairs that merely keep rental apartments in operating condition without increasing their value (e.g., painting, plumbing) are deductible maintenance expenses, as are litigation fees to eject tenants and collect rentals [6].

3. **YES.** When property bought during the Japanese occupation is sold after the war, the Ballantyne Scale is used to compute the tax base. Since the purchase price was in Japanese military notes and the selling price in present legal tender, the acquisition cost must be converted to a comparable value to properly determine gain or loss [7], [8].

4. **NO.** Under Republic Act 82, "real property used in the trade or business of the taxpayer" was removed from the definition of capital assets in Section 34 of the Tax Code [9]. Since Gutierrez admitted using the properties in his leasing business, they are ordinary assets, and gains from their sale are fully taxable ordinary gains [9].

5. **PARTIALLY YES.**
   *   For 1951-1952: **NO.** The period to collect by court action is five years from the *assessment* of the tax (Section 332(c)). The assessment was made in 1956 and the action began in 1958, well within the period [10], [11].
   *   For 1954: **YES.** For collection by distraint and levy where a return was filed and not fraudulent, the prescriptive period is three years from the *filing* of the return (Section 51(d)). The warrant was issued two days after the three-year period expired, rendering it void [12].

**Disposition:** Decision modified. Petitioners ordered to pay deficiency income taxes for 1951-1954 totaling P11,929.00 plus statutory penalties.
