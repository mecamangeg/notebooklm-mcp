I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE OF PEDRO SANTILLON, CLARO SANTILLON v. PERFECTA MIRANDA, BENITO U. MIRANDA and ROSARIO CORRALES**, G.R. No. L-19281, June 30, 1965, 14 SCRA 563, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Pedro Santillon died intestate on November 21, 1953, leaving his wife, Perfecta Miranda, and one legitimate son, Claro Santillon [1]. Four years later, Claro filed a petition for letters of administration, which Perfecta opposed [2]. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan subsequently issued an order on June 28, 1961, declaring that in the intestate succession of Pedro, Perfecta and Claro shall each inherit one-half (1/2) of the estate, after deducting the widow's conjugal share [3]. Claro appealed, arguing he is entitled to 3/4 of the estate under Article 892 of the New Civil Code, which grants a widow only 1/4 of the hereditary estate in testate succession [4, 5]. Perfecta countered that Article 996, which governs intestate succession, entitles the surviving spouse to a share equal to that of each child [4, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the order of the lower court determining the distributive shares is appealable.
2. W/N a surviving spouse concurring with only one legitimate child in intestate succession is entitled to one-half (1/2) of the estate.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Rule 109, Section 1, a person may appeal in special proceedings from an order of the Court of First Instance when such order determines the distributive share of the estate to which such person is entitled [5]. The order here was final and dispositive of the shares, making it appealable [7].

2. **YES.** The Court held that **Article 996 of the Civil Code** governs, allocating the estate equally between the surviving spouse and the single legitimate child [8, 9]. The maxim of statutory construction that the plural includes the singular applies; thus, "children" in Article 996 includes the case where there is only one "child" [10]. The Petitioner's reliance on **Article 892** is misplaced because that provision fixes the *legitime* in *testamentary* succession, whereas Article 996 specifically governs *intestate* (legal) succession [8]. While the resulting division may seem disparate compared to testate shares, the Court is bound by the clear mandate of the statute [11].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [11].
