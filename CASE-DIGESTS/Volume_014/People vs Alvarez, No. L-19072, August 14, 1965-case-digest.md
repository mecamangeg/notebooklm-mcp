I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES and RAMON A. GONZALES v. RICARDO ALVAREZ**, G.R. No. L-19072, August 14, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Ramon A. Gonzales was the defense counsel in a criminal case for robbery in band with homicide, while Ricardo Alvarez was the Special Counsel in the Office of the Provincial Fiscal of Iloilo who filed the information for said case [1]. Gonzales filed a Motion to Quash, arguing that Alvarez lacked the authority to file the information because he held a classified position (Chief Clerk) and could not be appointed as Special Counsel [2].

In response, Alvarez filed an "Opposition to the Motion to Quash" containing statements accusing Gonzales of "hypocrisy," "dishonesty," "unfair practices," "base chicanery," "double talk," and resorting to "perversion and falsehood" for allegedly misleading the court regarding the law on special counsel appointments [3, 4]. Claiming these remarks were derogatory, Gonzales filed a complaint for Libel against Alvarez [5]. Alvarez moved to quash the libel information on the ground that the allegations did not constitute an offense because the statements were privileged [4]. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo granted the motion and dismissed the information [4]. Gonzales appealed [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the allegedly libelous statements made by Alvarez in his "Opposition to the Motion to Quash" constitute absolutely privileged communication.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the libel case. Under Article 354 of the Revised Penal Code and established jurisprudence, utterances made in the course of judicial proceedings, including pleadings, petitions, and motions, are absolutely privileged and exempt from liability for libel, provided they are connected with, or relevant, pertinent, or material to the cause in hand or subject of inquiry [7, 8].

The Court applies a liberal rule regarding the test of relevancy: the matter must be "so palpably wanting in relation to the subject matter of the controversy that no reasonable man can doubt its irrelevancy and impropriety" to lose the privilege [9]. Here, the issue in the original case was the correctness of Gonzales's motion to quash challenging Alvarez's authority. Alvarez's statements, while strong and vociferous, were pertinent to the cause because they were intended to denounce what he perceived as unethical and dishonest attempts by Gonzales to mislead the court regarding the applicable law (Section 1686 of the Revised Administrative Code) [10, 11]. Since the statements were relevant to the judicial proceeding, they are protected by the mantle of privileged communication regardless of malice [8].

The order of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Reyes, J.B.L., J. (Concurring):** Concurred with the ruling but expressed "stern disapproval" that the appellee stooped to using "unseemly personalities" and insults against a brother attorney, noting that such insults never strengthen an argument [12].
