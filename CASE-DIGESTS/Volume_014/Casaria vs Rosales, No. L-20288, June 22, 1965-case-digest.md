I. CAPTION
JOSE CASARIA and MILAGROS MESTIDIO v. RICARDO ROSALES, MERCEDES GLORIA, Spouses and RAMON BLANCO, in his capacity as Associate Judge of the Court of Agrarian Relations, 8th Regional District, G.R. No. L-20288, June 22, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Ricardo Rosales and Mercedes Gloria filed a petition for liquidation of harvests and ejectment against petitioner Jose Casaria in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). In his answer, Casaria admitted cultivating the land but denied any tenancy relationship with the respondents, claiming instead that the land belonged to petitioner Milagros Mestidio. Mestidio intervened, asserting ownership over the property and arguing that the CAR lacked jurisdiction because the issue involved ownership, not tenancy [1, 2].

The CAR conducted an ocular inspection and found that the boundaries of the land corresponded with Rosales’ tax declaration rather than Mestidio’s deed of sale. The lower court rendered a decision declaring Rosales and Gloria as the landholders and ordering Casaria to deliver their share of the harvest [3, 4]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the CAR lacked jurisdiction because the ownership of the land was in issue [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction over a case involving tenancy disputes where the defendant raises the issue of ownership of the land.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint or petition, not by the defenses raised in the answer [5]. The petition filed in the CAR alleged facts regarding the liquidation of harvests and the ejectment of a tenant by a landholder, which fall under the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the CAR pursuant to Section 21 of R.A. 1199 and Section 7 of R.A. 1267 [6].

The Court ruled that once the Agrarian Court acquires jurisdiction based on the complaint, it subsists even if the answer denies the landlord-tenant relationship and adversely interposes ownership [7]. Furthermore, the CAR acted within its limited jurisdiction by not adjudicating the title or ownership of the land, but merely determining who, between the parties, was the "landholder" entitled to the share of the produce [7].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
