I. CAPTION
VISAYAN PACKING CORPORATION v. REPARATIONS COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-20577, May 31, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On November 14, 1960, petitioner Visayan Packing Corporation and respondent Reparations Commission entered into a "Contract of Conditional Purchase and Sale" of Capital Goods regarding a total F.O.B. cost of P1,357,124.67 [1]. The contract specified that the first installment (10% of cost, or P135,712.47) was due on April 5, 1962, with ten subsequent equal yearly installments beginning April 5, 1963 [1, 2].

On March 20, 1962, petitioner filed an action for declaratory relief with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, claiming ambiguity regarding the exact date and amount of the first payment [3]. While this case was pending, respondent filed a separate civil action (Civil Case No. 51713) on September 27, 1962, to collect the P135,712.47 first installment [4]. Consequently, the CFI dismissed the petition for declaratory relief on the ground that the interpretation of the contract was no longer necessary as the matter would be resolved in the pending collection case [5, 6]. Petitioner appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the action for declaratory relief was proper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the institution of the collection case (Civil Case No. 51713) for the recovery of the first payment rendered the petition for declaratory relief mere surplusage [7]. The Court reasoned that an action for declaratory relief is properly dismissed when the subject matter—in this case, the interpretation of the schedule of payments—would necessarily be threshed out in another pending case [5, 8].

Furthermore, the Court noted that there was actually nothing to interpret because the terms of the contract were clear and in accordance with Section 12 of Republic Act No. 1789, which requires reparations goods to be paid in eleven payments (one initial payment and ten installments) [7, 9].

The Order appealed from is AFFIRMED in all respects [10].
