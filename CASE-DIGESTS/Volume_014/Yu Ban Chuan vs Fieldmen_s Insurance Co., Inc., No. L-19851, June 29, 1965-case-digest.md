**I. CAPTION**
YU BAN CHUAN v. FIELDMEN’S INSURANCE CO., INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-19851, June 29, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiff Yu Ban Chuan, doing business as "CMC Trading," insured his stock of general merchandise against fire with defendants Fieldmen’s Insurance Co. (P200,000) and Paramount Surety & Insurance Co. (P140,000). The policies were transferred to his new premises at 680 Muelle de Binondo, Manila. On January 31, 1960, the premises and stocks were totally destroyed by fire. Plaintiff filed claims, relying on a merchandise inventory as of December 31, 1959, and various invoices to prove a total loss of over P350,000. The insurers rejected the claims due to plaintiff's failure to submit required documents and the alleged fraudulent nature of the claim.

Plaintiff filed suit in the Court of First Instance of Manila. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, ordering the insurers to pay the full amounts of the policies. The insurers appealed, arguing that the plaintiff submitted false and fraudulent proof of loss. Evidence showed that multiple invoices submitted by the plaintiff—totalling P248,370.00—were fake, issued by non-existent or defunct companies, or contained forged signatures. Some invoices bore the new address of the business even though they were dated prior to the plaintiff's transfer to that location. Plaintiff claimed he bought the goods from agents on the street who later vanished.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the insurers are liable to pay the insurance claims despite the submission of falsified invoices and proofs of loss.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court ruled that the falsity of the invoices submitted by the insured to prove the actual existence of the stocks is evidence of a fraudulent claim, which avoids the insurer's liability pursuant to Condition No. 13 of the insurance policies.

The Court held that while Section 82 of the Insurance Act states that an insured is "not bound to give such proof as would be necessary in a court of justice," this does not justify the submission of false proofs. The plaintiff's explanation regarding the source of the goods (buying from anonymous agents in the streets) was deemed incredible. Furthermore, the inventory relied upon by the plaintiff was not binding on the insurers as it was prepared without their intervention. Consequently, the judgment was reversed and the plaintiff's action was dismissed.
