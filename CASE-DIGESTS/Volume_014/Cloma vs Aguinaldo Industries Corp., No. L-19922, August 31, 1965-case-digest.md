I. CAPTION
ERNESTO CLOMA, GAUDENCIO LOPEZ and MARIO LAXAMANA v. AGUINALDO INDUSTRIES CORPORATION, AGUINALDO EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION (NLU) and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-19922, August 31, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were employees of respondent Aguinaldo Industries Corporation and members of respondent Aguinaldo Employees Association (NLU). The Corporation and NLU had a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) containing a closed-shop provision effective until June 30, 1960 [1]. On April 4, 1960, petitioners joined a rival union, PAFLU [1]. Consequently, NLU expelled them on October 5, 1960, and demanded their dismissal pursuant to the closed-shop clause [1]. The Corporation dismissed them in January 1961 [1, 2].

Petitioners filed a complaint for unfair labor practices with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), arguing that their dismissal was unwarranted because they joined PAFLU shortly before the CBA expiration and ostensibly after a petition for certification election had been filed [1, 3]. The CIR dismissed the complaint, ruling that the expulsion and dismissal were in accordance with the union's by-laws and the closed-shop agreement [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the petitioners pursuant to the closed-shop agreement constitutes unfair labor practice.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's order, holding that acts performed in accordance with a valid closed-shop agreement do not constitute unfair labor practice [4, 5].

It was conceded that under NLU's by-laws, the union is entitled to expel members who join another labor organization, and under the closed-shop agreement, the Corporation is bound to dismiss employees who cease to be members of the union [3, 4]. Since the legality of these provisions was not disputed, the resulting dismissal was valid [2, 5]. The Court further noted that the petitioners joined PAFLU on April 4, 1960, which was prior to the filing of the petition for certification election on April 11, 1960 [2]. Moreover, the CBA was renewed in July 1960—a renewal uncontested by petitioners—and the dismissal occurred subsequently in conformity with the renewed contract [2].

Order affirmed [6].
