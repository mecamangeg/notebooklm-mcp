I. CAPTION
ELIZALDE & CO., INC., doing business under the name “HACIENDA VALENCIA” v. ALLIED WORKERS’ ASSOCIATION OF THE PHILIPPINES, Bais Chapter, Agricultural Section (AWA) and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-20792, May 31, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Allied Workers’ Association of the Philippines (AWA) petitioned the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) for certification as the sole and exclusive representative of the employees of “Hacienda Valencia,” a sugar cane enterprise owned by petitioner Elizalde & Co., Inc. Elizalde filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the workers were agricultural laborers and that jurisdiction belonged to the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR), not the CIR, citing *Santos vs. C.I.R.*.

The CIR hearing judge granted the motion to dismiss. However, upon appeal to the CIR *en banc*, the court reversed the dismissal by a majority vote. The CIR asserted it had jurisdiction over union rights of agricultural workers under Section 27 of Republic Act No. 2263. Elizalde filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has jurisdiction over a certification election petition involving agricultural workers in a sugar cane hacienda.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CIR resolution.

The Court held that controversies between capital and labor in agricultural lands under any system of cultivation fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR), not the CIR. Citing *Victorias Milling Co. vs. C.I.R.* and *Santos vs. C.I.R.*, the Court reiterated that agricultural laborers do not come within the purview of the word "employee" defined in Section 2(d) of the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. 875).

Under Section 7 of R.A. 1267, the CAR has exclusive jurisdiction to settle all disputes involving relationships in the cultivation of agricultural land. This jurisdiction is broad enough to include disputes over union representation of agricultural laborers. Furthermore, the Court clarified that violations of agricultural laborers' rights under Section 27 of R.A. 2263 are punishable under Section 57 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act (R.A. 1199) and the contempt power of the CAR, not under the Industrial Peace Act. Finally, the Court noted that R.A. 809 regarding the "sugar industry" does not convert agricultural laborers into industrial employees.

The resolution under review was **REVERSED**, and the petition for certification was ordered **DISMISSED**.
