I. CAPTION
BCI EMPLOYEES AND WORKERS UNION (PAFLU) v. HON. PIO MARCOS and BENGUET CONSOLIDATED, INC., G.R. No. L-21016, July 30, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On March 3, 1963, petitioner Union declared a strike and picketed Benguet Consolidated, Inc.'s mining areas in Itogon, Benguet, following failed conciliation conferences. On March 6, 1963, the Company filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Baguio (Civil Case No. 1240), presided by respondent Judge Pio Marcos, to enjoin the picketing, alleging it was unlawful. The Union moved to dismiss, arguing that the strike was due to Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) acts already subject of pending litigation in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) — specifically Case No. 2363-ULP (filed in 1960) and Case No. 3289-ULP (filed in 1962) involving discriminatory dismissals. Judge Marcos denied the motion and issued a preliminary injunction on March 12, 1963. The Union filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to issue an injunction against picketing when the labor dispute is interwoven with unfair labor practice cases pending in the Court of Industrial Relations.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Court of First Instance (CFI) is without jurisdiction. The record disclosed that the labor dispute causing the strike and picketing was directly involved in two ULP cases already pending before the CIR. Under **Section 5(a) of Republic Act No. 875**, the jurisdiction of the CIR over unfair labor practice cases is exclusive.

The Court applied the doctrine that when the issue in an action filed in the CFI is "interwoven with unfair labor practice cases pending before the Court of Industrial Relations," the action is outside the jurisdiction of regular courts. This rule applies even if the petition involves acts of violence, intimidation, and coercion (*National Garments and Textiles Workers' Union-PAFLU v. Caluag*; *FilHispano Labor Union v. Montesa*). The rationale is to avoid multiplicity of suits, as the Industrial Court has ample powers under RA 875 to grant injunctive relief against such acts.

The petition for certiorari was **GRANTED**, declaring the respondent judge without jurisdiction to act in Civil Case No. 1240, and the injunction was made permanent against the respondents.
