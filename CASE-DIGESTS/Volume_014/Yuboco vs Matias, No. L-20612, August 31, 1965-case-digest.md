I. CAPTION
FELIX A. YUBOCO, ET AL. v. JOSE L. MATIAS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20612, August 31, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On September 28, 1959, plaintiffs filed a complaint to compel defendants to comply with a preliminary contract, tendering a check for P20,000.00 as earnest money [1, 2]. Defendants answered that the plaintiffs failed to comply with a condition regarding the assumption of estate and inheritance taxes, and offered to return the check [3]. Following various pleadings, the trial court issued a preliminary writ of injunction against the defendants in September 1960 [1]. In June 1962, the Court of First Instance of Manila *motu proprio* dismissed the case for failure to prosecute, noting that the plaintiffs had done nothing to prosecute their claim for one full year [4]. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal [4]. The record revealed that during the pendency of the case, plaintiffs withdrew the funds covering the earnest money check from the bank because there was "no sense in freezing" the amount [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the complaint for failure to prosecute was proper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal [6]. Although the period of inaction lasted only one year, the Court upheld the dismissal based on the presumption in favor of the correctness of the judge’s ruling, particularly because the existence of a preliminary injunction made a prompt decision imperative [4]. Furthermore, the Court found that the plaintiffs' withdrawal of the funds covering the earnest money check during the pendency of the case constituted a virtual rescission of the contract by the plaintiffs themselves or, at the very least, a valid defense for the defendants [5]. These facts defeated the plaintiffs' cause of action, justifying the dismissal [4, 7].

Order affirmed [6].
