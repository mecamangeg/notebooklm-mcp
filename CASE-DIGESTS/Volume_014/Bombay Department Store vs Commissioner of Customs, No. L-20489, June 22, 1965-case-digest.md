I. CAPTION
BOMBAY DEPARTMENT STORE v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-20489, June 22, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On December 12, 1954, petitioner Bombay Department Store received a shipment of five cases from New York declared in the commercial and consular invoices, bill of lading, import entry, and Central Bank release certificate as "Parts of Cycle" [1, 2]. Upon examination, Customs authorities discovered the cases contained complete bicycles in a knocked-down condition [2, 3]. The goods were seized for violations of the Revised Administrative Code (RAC) and Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 [4]. The Collector of Customs declared the goods forfeited (though released under bond), a decision affirmed by the Commissioner of Customs who ordered the bond confiscated [4]. The Court of Tax Appeals affirmed the Commissioner's ruling [5]. Petitioner argued there was no misdeclaration as the documents tallied with each other, and that the release certificate requirement had been repealed [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the declaration of complete bicycles in knocked-down condition as "parts of cycles" constitutes misdeclaration warranting forfeiture.
2. W/N Central Bank Circular No. 133 repealed the release certificate requirement under Circulars Nos. 44 and 45.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that because seizure proceedings are directed against the merchandise, the test for misdeclaration is a comparison of the goods actually received against the accompanying papers [7, 8]. While the petitioner's documents tallied with one another, they did not match the actual contents of the boxes [3]. Complete bicycles, even in knocked-down condition, are dutiable as an entirety and are subject to different duty rates than "parts of cycles" [9, 10]. Consequently, declaring them as "parts" constituted a misdeclaration subject to forfeiture under Section 1363(m)(3) and (4) of the Revised Administrative Code [3, 11].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that Central Bank Circular No. 133 did not impliedly repeal the requirement for release certificates in Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 [8, 12]. Instead, Circular No. 133 explicitly reiterated that imports shall be released only upon presentation of a release certificate issued by the Central Bank [6].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [13].
