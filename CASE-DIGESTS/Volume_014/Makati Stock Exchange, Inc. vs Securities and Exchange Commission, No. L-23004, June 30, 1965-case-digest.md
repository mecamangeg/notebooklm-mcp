I. CAPTION
MAKATI STOCK EXCHANGE, INC., petitioner, vs. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION and MANILA STOCK EXCHANGE, respondents., No. L-23004, June 30, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Makati Stock Exchange, Inc. (Makati) sought permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate a stock exchange. The SEC denied the license unless Makati agreed not to list securities already listed on the Manila Stock Exchange (Manila) [1]. This requirement was based on an SEC rule prohibiting "double listing," which the SEC argued was necessary for the "public interest" and investor protection [2, 3]. Since Manila had been operating alone for 25 years and listed essentially all valid securities, this rule practically prohibited Makati from operating, creating a monopoly [2, 3]. The SEC also argued that Makati was barred by *res judicata* because it failed to appeal a previous order dated May 27, 1963, which granted its incorporation but warned of the anti-double listing condition [4, 5]. Makati petitioned the Supreme Court to review the resolution [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the SEC has the power to prohibit the double listing of securities in different stock exchanges.
2. W/N the petition is barred by *res judicata* due to Makati's failure to appeal the initial SEC order.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the SEC has no express or implied power under the Securities Act to prohibit double listing [7, 8]. The general power to "regulate" under Section 33 of the Act does not imply the authority to "prohibit" [9]. The Court cited *Republic v. Esguerra* and *Primicias v. Fugoso* to support this distinction [9]. Furthermore, the Securities Act (Sec. 28b-13) explicitly contemplates the existence of two or more exchanges [10]. The rule was found to be unreasonable and discriminatory, effectively sanctioning a monopoly for the Manila Stock Exchange and violating the petitioner's constitutional right to equality and to pursue a lawful trade [11, 12]. The Court rejected the "public interest" argument, noting that competition rather than monopoly better serves investors by offering alternative prices and lower brokerage fees [13].

2. **NO.** The SEC order of May 27, 1963, was merely an anticipatory statement regarding the conditions for a future license application and primarily concerned the issuance of the certificate of incorporation [14]. Since Makati had not yet applied for the license to operate at that time, there was no need to appeal. Additionally, under Section 17-a-1 of the Securities Act, an agreement to comply with rules does not constitute a waiver of the right to contest their validity [15, 16].

The petition is approved, and the license to operate is granted without the condition against double listing [17].
