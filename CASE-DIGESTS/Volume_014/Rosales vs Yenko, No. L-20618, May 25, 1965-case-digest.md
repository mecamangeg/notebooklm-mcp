I. CAPTION
HERMENEGILDO R. ROSALES v. FLAVIANO YEN-KO, No. L-20618, May 25, 1965, Dizon, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On November 6, 1961, President Carlos P. Garcia signed an *ad interim* appointment for Petitioner Rosales as Chairman of the Board of Examiners for Chemists [3]. However, this appointment was never released or delivered to Rosales, and the original document remained in the Office of the President [3, 4]. Consequently, Rosales did not take an oath of office or qualify for this specific term [4].

Despite the non-release, a copy of the appointment was transmitted to the Commission on Appointments, which confirmed it on May 17, 1962 [3]. Prior to this confirmation, on December 31, 1961, the appointment had been recalled by Administrative Order No. 2 [3]. On November 5, 1962, President Diosdado Macapagal appointed Respondent Yenko as Acting Chairman [3]. Rosales filed a petition to declare Yenko's designation void and his own appointment valid [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a confirmed *ad interim* appointment is valid if the appointment paper was never released to the appointee. [6]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that an appointment is not complete until it is released to and accepted by the appointee.

Since Rosales admitted that the original appointment was never released to him and that he had not qualified for the position, the appointment was incomplete [6]. The Court held that without release and acceptance, "there was in fact and in law no *ad interim* appointment that could be validly transmitted to, and acted upon by, the Commission on Appointments" [6]. The confirmation by the Commission was therefore ineffectual because there was no valid appointment to confirm.

The petition is **DISMISSED**. [6]
