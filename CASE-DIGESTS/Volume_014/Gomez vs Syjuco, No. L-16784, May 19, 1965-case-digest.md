I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED GO FOOK. LLANE C. GOMEZ v. AUGUSTO G. SYJUCO, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-16784, May 19, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On March 20, 1954, Go Fook leased a hotel property in Baguio City for two years from Security Investment Corporation, which later sold the property to Augusto G. Syjuco and other appellants [1]. Go Fook died intestate on September 14, 1954 [1]. Llane C. Gomez was appointed administratrix and, with court authority, continued running the hotel and the lease [2]. Syjuco filed a claim for unpaid rentals covering February 1955 to January 1956, totaling P19,750.00 [3, 4]. Following the sale of movable properties found in the hotel, Syjuco moved to have their claim declared preferred with respect to the proceeds under Article 2241(12) of the Civil Code [2, 5]. The lower court denied the motion, ruling that under a strict construction of the law, the preference applies only to rentals incurred by the deceased personally, not those incurred by the administratrix [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the claim for unpaid rentals incurred by the administratrix on behalf of the estate is entitled to preference under Article 2241(12) of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that Article 2241, paragraph 12 of the Civil Code establishes a preference for "credits for rent for one year" upon the personal property of the lessee existing on the leased immovable, without distinguishing whether the rent was incurred personally by the lessee or by the administrator of his estate [7, 8]. Furthermore, the original lease was for a fixed period of two years and was not extinguished by the lessee's death; thus, the unpaid rentals fell due under the original contract entered into by the deceased [3]. Even if the lease were considered entered into by the administratrix, she did so on behalf of the estate with court authority, making the rentals legally the same as those under the original contract [4, 9].

The appealed order is reversed [10].
