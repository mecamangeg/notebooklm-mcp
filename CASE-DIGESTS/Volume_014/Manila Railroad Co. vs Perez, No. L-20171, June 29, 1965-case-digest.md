I. CAPTION
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, petitioner, vs. DANIEL PEREZ and THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, respondents., G.R. No. L-20171, June 29, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Daniel Perez was employed by petitioner Manila Railroad Company starting in 1939. He suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis, manifesting symptoms like spitting blood as early as 1940 and undergoing treatment in 1944 and 1946 [1, 2]. Despite this, he was rehired in 1946 as an assistant conductor, a role involving physical labor such as lifting baggage and irregular working hours [3, 4]. His condition worsened, and upon the advice of his superior due to his serious illness, he retired on January 1, 1951 [4].

Perez filed a claim for compensation on September 6, 1960 [5]. The Chief Hearing Officer dismissed the claim, finding the illness not work-connected. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed this decision and awarded compensation, finding the illness was aggravated by the nature of his employment [5, 6]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that "aggravation" only became a ground for compensation under Republic Act No. 772, which took effect on June 20, 1952—after Perez had already retired [7]. Petitioner also raised issues of prescription in a memorandum submitted to the Court [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the disability resulting from the aggravation of a pre-existing illness is compensable despite taking place before the effectivity of Republic Act No. 772.
2. W/N defenses regarding the non-applicability of the law and prescription are deemed waived if not raised before the Commission.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that an employer is liable for compensation even if the aggravation of a pre-existing illness and consequent disability occurred before June 20, 1952, the date Republic Act No. 772 took effect [9, 10]. The Philippine Workmen’s Compensation Law is patterned after US laws, where compensation for aggravation is granted even without specific statutory provisions [6]. Citing *Blue Bar Coconut Company v. Boo*, the Court ruled that the insertion of the words "tuberculosis" and "aggravated by" in the amended law did not change the import of the original provisions regarding employer liability [11].

2. **YES.** A defense against the compensability of a claim which was not raised before the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is deemed waived and cannot be raised for the first time in the petitioner’s brief or memorandum before the Supreme Court [12, 13]. Petitioner failed to raise the issue of RA 772's non-applicability or the prescription of the action during the WCC proceedings [11, 14]. Furthermore, the Court noted that compensation liability is created by statute and prescribes in ten (10) years under Article 1144(2) of the Civil Code; thus, the claim filed in 1960 for a 1951 disability was within the prescriptive period [15, 16].

The decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is AFFIRMED [17].
