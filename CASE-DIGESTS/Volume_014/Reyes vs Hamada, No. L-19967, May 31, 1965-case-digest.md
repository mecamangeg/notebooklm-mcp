I. CAPTION
ARSENIO REYES v. SINAI C. HAMADA and GERALDA M. HAMADA, G.R. No. L-19967, May 31, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Arsenio Reyes purchased properties belonging to Respondents Spouses Hamada at a foreclosure auction on February 11, 1960 [1]. On February 10, 1961, the last day of the redemption period, Respondents tendered payment to the Sheriff to redeem the properties [1]. Petitioner refused to recognize the validity of the redemption and filed Civil Case No. 1025 for declaration of ownership and possession [1]. While that case was pending, Petitioner filed a second action, Civil Case No. 1041, to recover rentals collected by Respondents from tenants of the property, citing Section 30, Rule 39 of the old Rules of Court [1]. The lower court dismissed the second case (Civil Case No. 1041) on the ground of pendency of another action [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the action for recovery of rentals was proper due to the pendency of the action involving the validity of the redemption.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the pendency of the case involving the validity of the redemption (Civil Case No. 1025) bars the prosecution of the case for recovery of rentals (Civil Case No. 1041) [4]. Under Section 30, Rule 39 of the old Rules of Court, while a purchaser may collect rentals from tenants during the redemption period, these rentals do not belong to him but pertain to the debtor/mortgagor, to whom the purchaser is accountable if redemption is effected [5]. Thus, the right to rentals is necessarily included in the issue of the timeliness and adequacy of the redemption [4]. The issues in both cases must be resolved in one proceeding. The order of dismissal is affirmed [4, 6].
