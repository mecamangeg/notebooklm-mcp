I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. ESPIRITU NG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19646, May 31, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On June 3, 1959, Espiritu Ng, a single male born in Manila of Chinese parents, filed a petition for naturalization [1]. He claimed to be employed as a supervisor at Pioneer Tobacco Corporation with a monthly salary of P170.00 (approximately P2,040.00 annually) and free board [1, 2]. In his petition, he listed his residence as No. 2089 Invernes St., Sta. Ana, Manila, but failed to disclose that he had resided in Baguio City for five years while completing his high school education [1, 3].

The Court of First Instance of Manila granted the petition, dismissing the government's opposition as unmeritorious [2]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing, among other grounds, that the petitioner did not have a lucrative trade or occupation and failed to state all former places of residence [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the failure to include all former places of residence in the petition is fatal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that an annual income of P2,040.00 (P170.00 a month) is grossly insufficient and far from being a lucrative occupation [2]. Considering the petitioner resides in Manila, where the standard of living is the highest in the country, this amount is not enough even for basic needs [2]. The Court cited *Ngo Go Liong Siu v. Republic*, where a monthly income of P300.00 was already deemed insufficient [4].

2. **YES.** The failure to declare all former places of residence is a violation of Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law [3]. The petitioner admitted to residing in Baguio for five years but did not include this in his petition [3]. This omission is fatal because disclosing all previous residences affords the government a fuller and more reliable basis for determining the applicant's fitness or disqualification to become a Filipino citizen [3].

The appealed decision is **REVERSED** [5].
