I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. JOAQUIN BONDOC, G.R. No. L-20236, July 30, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On June 29, 1949, the Philippine National Bank (PNB) obtained a judgment in Civil Case No. 8040 against Joaquin Bondoc for a sum of money, which was never executed [1]. On February 20, 1957, PNB revived said judgment in Civil Case No. 30663, ordering Bondoc to pay P16,841.64 plus interest; however, this revived judgment was also not enforced within five years [2]. On June 7, 1962, PNB filed Civil Case No. 50601 to enforce the judgment rendered in the 1957 revival case [2]. Bondoc moved to dismiss, arguing that the action had prescribed as more than ten years had elapsed since the original 1949 judgment, and that the law does not allow the revival of a revived judgment [3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint on these grounds [3]. PNB appealed [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a revived judgment may itself be revived and enforced by a new action.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that a revived judgment may itself be revived. Section 6 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court allows a judgment to be enforced by action after the lapse of five years and before it is barred by the statute of limitations, making no distinction as to the kind of judgment [4]. A judgment rendered on a complaint for the revival of a previous judgment is a **new judgment**, and the rights of the plaintiff rest on this new judgment, not on the previous one [5].

Therefore, the ten-year prescriptive period to enforce a judgment under Article 1144(3) of the New Civil Code is counted from the date the *revived* judgment became final, not from the date of the original judgment [6]. Since the revived judgment in Civil Case No. 30663 became final in 1957, the action to enforce it filed in 1962 was well within the ten-year prescriptive period [7].

The Order appealed from is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED to the lower court for further proceedings [7].
