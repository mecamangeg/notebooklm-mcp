I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SEGUNDO MARQUEZ Y CASTRO, G.R. No. L-20139, May 19, 1965, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Segundo Marquez y Castro, along with two co-accused, was charged in the Court of First Instance of Manila with theft of equipment belonging to Meralco valued at P3,500.00. While they initially pleaded not guilty, they were allowed to withdraw their plea and plead guilty as accessories to the crime of theft [1]. The trial court convicted them as accessories after the fact and sentenced each to suffer four (4) months and one (1) day of *arresto mayor* [1]. Marquez appealed, arguing that under the Revised Penal Code, the penalty should be lower by two degrees than that prescribed for the consummated felony, which would result in a lighter sentence [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the penalty of four (4) months and one (1) day of *arresto mayor* imposed by the lower court is correct.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court modified the penalty to one (1) month and one (1) day of *arresto mayor* [3].

The Court held that since the value of the stolen property was P3,500.00 (more than P200 but not exceeding P6,000), the penalty for the consummated crime is *prision correccional* in its minimum and medium periods under Article 309, paragraph 3 of the Revised Penal Code [2, 4]. Under Article 53, the penalty for an accessory must be two degrees lower than that prescribed for the consummated felony [4]. Pursuant to Article 61, paragraph 5, two degrees lower than *prision correccional* minimum and medium is *destierro* in its maximum period to *arresto mayor* in its minimum period [5].

Since there is no medium or middle ground between these two distinct penalties (*destierro* being banishment and *arresto mayor* being imprisonment), the Court applied the ruling in *Cristobal v. People*, holding that the penalty of one (1) month and one (1) day of *arresto mayor* is preferable as it is more favorable to the accused than *destierro* [5].

The decision appealed from was modified, sentencing the appellant to one (1) month and one (1) day of *arresto mayor* [3].
