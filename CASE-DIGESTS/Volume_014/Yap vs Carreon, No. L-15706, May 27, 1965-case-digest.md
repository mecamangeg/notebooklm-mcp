I. CAPTION
ILDEFONSO D. YAP and PHILIPPINE HARVARDIAN COLLEGE v. MANUEL L. CARREON, G.R. No. L-15706, May 27, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Ildefonso D. Yap, president of Philippine Harvardian College, applied to the Bureau of Private Schools for permits to offer various courses in his San Fernando and Calumpit (St. John’s College) branches [1, 2]. Following inspections that revealed uncorrected deficiencies, the applications were disapproved [2]. On June 30, 1952, respondent Manuel L. Carreon, the Director of Private Schools, submitted a list of courses disauthorized for the school year to the Secretary of Education [3]. This list, which included Yap's schools, was published in metropolitan newspapers [3]. News reports accompanying the release described the Bureau's move as a drive against "diploma mills" [4].

Yap filed a suit for damages (P210,000.00) in the Court of First Instance of Manila, arguing that under Section 11 of Act No. 2706, the Director was only authorized to publish lists of *approved* courses, not disapproved ones, and that the publication damaged the school's reputation [5-7]. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and the case was certified to the Supreme Court [1, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Director of Private Schools is authorized to publish lists of disapproved courses and schools.
2. W/N the Director is liable for damages regarding the publication and the "diploma mill" label in news reports.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that while Section 11 of Act No. 2706 explicitly authorizes the publication of approved schools, interpreting this as a prohibition against publishing *disapproved* schools is "too literal and narrow" [6, 7]. The law is intended for the "information of the public," specifically to protect students and parents from enrolling in unauthorized institutions [8]. The Court noted that even without statutory authority, issuing press releases informative of official action is "normal procedure in our democratic system" [7].

2. **NO.** The Director incurs no liability, civil or criminal, for releasing the list because he acted within his legal authority [9, 10]. Regarding the "diploma mill" epithet, the Court found no evidence that Carreon himself used the term [11]. The news stories were written by reporters, and the imputation was merely their interpretation or hearsay [11]. The Court ruled that a public official is not responsible for newspaper attributions he did not make, nor is he required to issue denials for every inaccuracy published about him [11].

The judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED [12].
