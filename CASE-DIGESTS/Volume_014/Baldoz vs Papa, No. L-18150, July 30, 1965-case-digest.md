I. CAPTION
SUPERIOR BALDOZ v. SERAPIA PAPA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18150, July 30, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In 1957, the predecessors of respondents Serapia Papa, et al. applied for land registration (Case No. 2215) in Pangasinan [1]. Baldomero Baldoz, the petitioner's father, filed an opposition but died pending the proceedings [1, 2]. During a hearing on October 1, 1958, no one appeared for the oppositor, resulting in an order of default against Baldomero [2]. His counsel subsequently filed a motion to set aside the default and substitute petitioner Superior Baldoz as the party-oppositor, but the trial court denied this motion [2]. Petitioner did not appeal this denial [2].

On February 16, 1959, the court rendered judgment granting the registration, and the final decree was issued on June 16, 1959 [3]. In 1960, petitioner filed a separate civil action (Civil Case No. D-1036) to annul the registration decision, arguing the court had lost jurisdiction over his deceased father [3, 4]. The lower court dismissed this complaint on the grounds of *res judicata* and that the remedy was improper [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the registration court lost jurisdiction over the deceased oppositor, rendering the judgment void.
2. W/N a separate action is the proper remedy to review a final decree of registration.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that by filing a motion for substitution and asking for affirmative relief, the petitioner and his co-heirs submitted to the jurisdiction of the registration court [6]. Since they failed to appeal the order denying their motion for substitution, that order, as well as the registration proceedings, became final and conclusive against them [6].

2. **NO.** Citing the nature of the proceedings, the Court ruled that land registration proceedings are *in rem* and binding upon the whole world [7, 8]. Under Section 38 of Act 496, a final decree of registration is reviewable only within one year of its issuance and solely on the ground of fraud [5, 8]. Crucially, the Court established that "any petition to set aside the decree must be filed... not in the form of a separate action like the present but in the form of a motion filed in the same registration proceeding where the decree was issued" [7, 8].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [9].
