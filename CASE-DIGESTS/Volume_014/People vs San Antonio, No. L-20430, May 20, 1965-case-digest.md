I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. EDUVIGES SAN ANTONIO, G.R. No. L-20430, May 20, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J. [1]

II. FACTS
Veronica M. de Leon filed a complaint for Estafa against Eduviges San Antonio [2]. The Information filed in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan alleged that in March 1961, in Obando, Bulacan, San Antonio received P2,620.00 from de Leon to buy rice, with the obligation to deliver the rice or return the money to Obando on or before May 20, 1961 [2]. San Antonio filed a motion to quash, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction because the receipt she signed was executed in Manila, indicating the transaction took place there [3]. The CFI granted the motion and dismissed the case, ruling that the transaction was consummated in Manila [4]. The Prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance of Bulacan has jurisdiction over the case. [4]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the Information, not by the evidence presented during a motion to quash [4]. The Information categorically stated that the accused received the money in Obando, Bulacan [5]. Furthermore, even if the money was received in Manila as indicated by the receipt, the accused's express undertaking was to deliver the rice or return the money in Obando, Bulacan [6]. The failure to account or return the money, which is an essential element of Estafa, occurred in Obando, thereby placing the offense within the jurisdiction of the CFI of Bulacan [6, 7].

The Order quashing the information is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings. [8]
