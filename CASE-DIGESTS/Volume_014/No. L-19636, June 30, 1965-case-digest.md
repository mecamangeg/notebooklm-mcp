I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. ANTONIO SY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19636, June 30, 1965, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
Antonio Sy, a single citizen of the Republic of China born in Negros Occidental, filed a petition for naturalization on March 29, 1961 [1]. He resided in Iloilo City from 1938 to 1952, moved to Bacolod City from 1952 to 1957, and returned to Iloilo City thereafter [1]. Sy worked as a traveling salesman for Manila Victoria Trading with a monthly salary of P240.00 and a daily allowance of P12.00 when traveling [2]. To support his petition, he presented two character witnesses who were residents of Iloilo City only [3]. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo granted the petition on February 1, 1962 [1]. The Republic appealed, arguing that Sy’s employment was not lucrative [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or profession.
2. W/N the character witnesses were qualified to vouch for the petitioner.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that a monthly salary of P240.00 is not lucrative [4]. The P12.00 daily traveling allowance is intended to cover necessary expenses and is not included in computing income [2]. Citing *Ong v. Republic* and *Yu v. Republic*, the Court held that an income below P250.00 a month is not lucrative due to the high cost of living [4]. This standard applies even if the applicant is single, as he should not be forced to remain single to avoid becoming a burden to society [5].

2. **NO.** The character witnesses were not qualified because they resided only in Iloilo City, while the petitioner spent a significant period (1952–1957) residing in Bacolod City [3]. Thus, the witnesses could not attest to the petitioner’s good moral character and irreproachable conduct during the "entire period of his residence in the Philippines" as required by Sec. 2, Par. 3 of the Revised Naturalization Law [3].

The judgment appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DENIED** [6].
