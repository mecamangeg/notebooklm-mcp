I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. CHENG KIAT GIAM v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16999, June 22, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cheng Kiat Giam was granted Philippine citizenship via a decision promulgated on September 7, 1953. However, he did not file a petition for the reception of evidence for oath-taking until November 9, 1959, more than six years later. During the hearing for his oath-taking, Cheng initially withheld the fact that he faced several pending criminal cases, only admitting to them when questioned by the trial judge. The lower court granted him a postponement to prove his innocence in these cases. On the rescheduled date, Cheng was still not ready and moved for an indefinite postponement. The Court of First Instance of Manila denied the motion and dismissed his petition for oath-taking for failure to establish compliance with Republic Act No. 530. Cheng appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is entitled to take the oath of citizenship despite the six-year delay and failure to disclose pending cases.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the dismissal of the petition. First, filing the petition for oath-taking more than six years after the decision granting citizenship, instead of within the standard two-year period, indicated a "lack of interest" [1, 2]. Republic Act No. 530 was enacted to provide a two-year probationary period to test the applicant's sincerity, which the petitioner failed to demonstrate [3]. Second, Cheng's reluctance to disclose pending criminal cases during direct examination rendered his right to take the oath "extremely doubtful" [1, 2]. Citing *Ly Hong vs. Republic*, the Court held that any doubt concerning the grant of citizenship should be resolved in favor of the State and against the petitioner [2, 4]. Finally, the trial court acted within its complete discretion in denying the indefinite postponement, as Cheng had already been given an opportunity to present evidence but failed to do so [4, 5]. The order denying the oath-taking was affirmed [6].
