I. CAPTION
FELICULO ISRAEL v. HON. NUMERIANO G. ESTENZO and THE OFFICE OF THE CITY FISCAL, ORMOC CITY, G.R. No. L-24671, June 30, 1965, Makalintal, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Feliculo Israel filed a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction against the respondents regarding a charge of indirect contempt filed against him [1, 2]. The respondent City Fiscal of Ormoc City had sought to enforce the attendance of the petitioner as a witness during an investigation authorized under the Charter of Ormoc City (R.A. No. 179) [3]. The Fiscal enforced this by application to the court. The petitioner challenged the proceedings, raising issues regarding the nature of the contempt charge and the jurisdiction of the court under the Judiciary Act [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a charge of indirect contempt is a criminal offense governed by Section 87 of the Judiciary Act.
2. W/N the City Fiscal followed the correct procedure in enforcing the attendance of a witness.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that a charge of indirect contempt falls under Rule 71, Section 4 of the Rules of Court, which provides that it may be filed in the Court of First Instance of the province or city where the contempt was committed [2]. It is punished under Section 6 of the same Rule, not under any penal statute [2]. Contempt is not a criminal offense within the meaning of Section 87 of the Judiciary Act, as amended, and is not initiated by means of an information, but is a special civil action [2].

2. **YES.** The procedure followed by the respondent City Fiscal was in accordance with Section 24(f) of the Charter of Ormoc City (R.A. No. 179) [3]. This section authorizes the Fiscal to subpoena witnesses and enforce the attendance of an absent or recalcitrant witness by application to the Municipal Court or the Court of First Instance [3].

The petition was dismissed for lack of merit [3].
