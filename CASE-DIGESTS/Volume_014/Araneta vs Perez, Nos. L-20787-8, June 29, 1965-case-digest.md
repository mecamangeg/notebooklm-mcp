**I. CAPTION**
**J. ANTONIO ARANETA v. ANTONIO PEREZ**, G.R. Nos. L-20787-8, June 29, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
On June 16, 1961, Antonio Perez executed a promissory note for P3,700.00 payable to J. Antonio Araneta, or order, maturing in 119 days, with 9% interest per annum if unpaid, plus attorney's fees [1]. When the note fell due, Perez failed to pay despite demand. Araneta filed a collection suit in the Municipal Court of Manila [2]. Perez admitted the execution and non-payment but alleged the proceeds were used for the medical treatment of his daughter, Angela, a beneficiary of a trust administered by Araneta. He argued the trust estate should pay the debt [2]. Perez also filed a separate complaint against Araneta as trustee for reimbursement [3]. The Municipal Court granted judgment on the pleadings for Araneta in the collection case and dismissed Perez's complaint against the trust [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance consolidated the cases and affirmed the lower court's decisions [5]. Perez appealed, contending the trust estate is the true debtor or, alternatively, he should be reimbursed by the trust [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N Perez is personally liable for the promissory note despite spending the proceeds on the trust beneficiary.
2. W/N the trust estate is liable to reimburse Perez for the medical expenses.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** Under Section 60 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, the maker of a negotiable instrument engages to pay it according to its tenor [7]. Perez cannot escape liability by alleging he spent the money for his daughter's medical treatment, as the destination of the proceeds is the sole concern of the maker and is of no concern to the payee [7]. The payee's interest is merely to see the note paid according to its terms [7].

2. **NO.** While a trust fund may be applied to medical expenses of a beneficiary, this applies only when the beneficiary is insolvent [8]. In this case, Perez admitted the beneficiary had properties worth at least a quarter of a million pesos [8]. Since the beneficiary was solvent and could provide for her own necessities, there was no basis for the trust estate to shoulder the expenses or reimburse Perez [9].

**Petition DENIED.** The order is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the payment of interest on the note shall start from the date of extrajudicial demand, October 18, 1961 [10].
