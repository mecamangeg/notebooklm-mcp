I. CAPTION
FORTUNATO F. HALILI v. EUSEBIO DAPLAS, G.R. No. L-20282, May 19, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Eusebio Daplas filed an application with the Public Service Commission (PSC) for a certificate of public convenience to operate 20 buses on the route from Amparo Subdivision, Caloocan City to Divisoria, Manila [1]. Petitioner Fortunato Halili, an existing operator on the line, opposed the application, claiming his service was sufficient to meet public demand [1, 2].

During the hearings, Daplas presented evidence, including testimonies from residents and a petition from affected passengers, showing that students and employees in Amparo Subdivision faced difficulty securing transportation and that Halili’s buses were often full to capacity [3, 4]. Halili presented counter-evidence, including checker reports, arguing there was no public necessity for additional service [5].

The PSC, weighing the evidence, found room for increased service and authorized Daplas to operate 12 of the 20 units applied for [2, 6]. Halili appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the PSC's findings of fact and alleging ruinous competition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Public Service Commission's finding of public necessity is supported by substantial evidence.
2. W/N the grant of the certificate to the respondent constitutes ruinous competition.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Public Service Commission's findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive upon the Supreme Court [7, 8]. The Court is only authorized to modify or ignore such findings when it clearly appears there is no evidence to reasonably support the conclusion [8]. Here, the Court found the applicant submitted substantial testimonial and documentary evidence proving that residents of Amparo Subdivision had difficulty riding the oppositor's buses [4, 6]. Citing *Javellana v. La Paz Ice Plant & Cold Storage Co.*, the Court held it could not substitute its conclusion for that of the Commission when sufficient evidence supports the latter [8].

2. **NO.** To establish ruinous competition, the oppositor must show that they "would be deprived of fair profits on the capital invested in its business" [7, 9]. The Court held that the mere possibility of a reduction in earnings is not sufficient to prove ruinous competition; it must be demonstrated that the business would not have sufficient gains to pay a fair rate of interest on its capital investment [9]. Halili failed to provide such proof.

The decision appealed from is affirmed [10].
