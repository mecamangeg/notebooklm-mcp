I. CAPTION
ADRIANO ANTONIO v. BENJAMIN JALANDONI and MANUEL PLANA, G.R. No. L-18301, July 31, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Adriano Antonio previously filed Civil Case No. 4172 against defendants Benjamin Jalandoni and Manuel Plana to recover Lot No. 8119 (Passi Cadastre). Antonio claimed Lot 8119 was formerly river bed and became an accretion to his Lot No. 564 due to a sudden change in the Jalaud River's course in 1954 [1]. This first case was dismissed when Antonio failed to appear at trial [2].

Antonio subsequently filed the present action, Civil Case No. 4743, against the same defendants [2]. In this second complaint, he altered his theory, claiming ownership via gradual alluvium starting in 1928, rather than a sudden river course change. Furthermore, he expanded the subject matter, claiming not just Lot No. 8119 but also a "big portion" of Lot No. 1104, asserting that a total of 15 hectares had accreted to his property (now identified as Lot No. 761-A) [3]. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground of *res judicata* [1]. Antonio appealed, arguing lack of identity of cause of action and subject matter [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the second complaint on the ground of *res judicata* was proper.

IV. RULING
**NO.** (The dismissal was improper regarding the additional area claimed).

The Supreme Court ruled that while there was **identity of cause of action**, there was **no complete identity of subject matter**.

Regarding the cause of action, the Court held that the difference in the manner the plaintiff claims to have acquired his right (sudden change in river course vs. gradual alluvium) does not constitute distinct causes of action [4]. Both actions were based on the alleged right of ownership and possession and the violation thereof [4].

However, regarding the subject matter, *res judicata* did not apply to the entire claim. In the first action, Antonio sought to recover only Lot No. 8119 (approx. 2 to 4 hectares) [5]. In the present action, he claimed a total of 15 hectares, including a large portion of Lot No. 1104 [5]. The Court reasoned that under the allegations of the first complaint, Antonio could not have recovered this additional area, and evidence regarding it would have been irrelevant [5]. Thus, the bar by prior judgment applies only to Lot No. 8119, but not to the additional area claimed in the second complaint [5].

**Order set aside and case remanded to lower court for further proceedings.**
