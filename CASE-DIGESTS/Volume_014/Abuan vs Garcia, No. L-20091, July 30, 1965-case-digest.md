**I. CAPTION**
**PERPETUA ABUAN, ET AL. v. EUSTAQUIO S. GARCIA, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-20091, July 30, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Laureano Abuan acquired a homestead which passed to his heirs (petitioners) upon his death. On August 7, 1953, petitioners sold the land to respondents via a public "Deed of Absolute Sale," resulting in the issuance of a new Transfer Certificate of Title to respondents [1]. Petitioners later filed an action to recover the land alleging fraud, but the parties settled amicably through an "Agreement" dated February 28, 1955. This agreement superseded previous contracts, with respondents making a partial payment and promising the balance by April 1955 [2].

On March 4, 1960, petitioners filed an action for legal redemption under Section 119 of the Public Land Law, which allows repurchase within five years from conveyance. They argued the period should run from the full payment of the purchase price in May 1955. Respondents moved to dismiss on the ground of prescription. The Court of First Instance of Nueva Vizcaya dismissed the complaint, ruling the action was barred. The Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court on the legal issue [3, 4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the five-year period for legal redemption starts from the date of full payment of the purchase price.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. Under Section 119 of the Public Land Law, the five-year period runs from the "date of conveyance," which refers to the transfer of ownership [5].

Applying Article 1498 of the New Civil Code, the execution of the public instrument (Deed of Absolute Sale) on August 7, 1953, was equivalent to the delivery of the thing sold, thereby transferring ownership to the respondents [6, 7]. Even assuming the 1953 deed was void, the "Agreement" of February 28, 1955, clearly manifested the intention to transfer possession and ownership, constituting delivery *brevi manu* under Articles 1499 and 1501 [8, 9].

The Court held that absent an express stipulation to the contrary, the payment of the purchase price is not a condition precedent to the transfer of ownership [9]. Since the action was filed in March 1960—more than five years after either the 1953 deed or the 1955 agreement—the right to redeem had expired.

**Order affirmed.**
