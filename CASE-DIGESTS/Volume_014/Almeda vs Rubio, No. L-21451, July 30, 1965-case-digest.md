I. CAPTION
**DOMINADOR T. ALMEDA and JOSEFA MENDOZA-ALMEDA v. CONCEPCION A. RUBIO and CLEMENTE S. RUBIO**, G.R. No. L-21451, July 30, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Dominador and Josefa Almeda filed a complaint for "Consolidation of Ownership" against defendants Concepcion and Clemente Rubio in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Sur. The CFI ruled that the contract between the parties, ostensibly a sale with right to repurchase, was actually an equitable mortgage due to the inadequacy of the price and the defendants' continued possession as lessees [1, 2]. Consequently, the CFI ordered the Rubios to pay the Almedas the principal loan of P5,000.00 plus interest at 12% *per annum* calculated from the date of the contract's execution [2]. The Rubios appealed to the Court of Appeals, questioning only the rate of interest and the date from which it should be computed. The Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court as the issues raised were purely legal [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court correctly imposed a 12% interest rate in the absence of a written stipulation.
2. W/N the interest should be computed from the date of the execution of the contract.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the imposition of 12% interest has no legal basis. Under Article 2209 of the Civil Code, if an obligation consists of the payment of a sum of money and the debtor incurs delay, the indemnity shall be the payment of the interest agreed upon. In the absence of any stipulation, the rate is the legal interest, which is 6% *per annum* [3, 4]. Since the contract was declared an equitable mortgage and contained no stipulation regarding interest, only the legal rate applies [4].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that interest becomes due only upon demand, whether judicial or extrajudicial. Since there was no evidence on record of an extrajudicial demand prior to the lawsuit, default is incurred only upon the filing of the case. Pursuant to Article 1169 of the Civil Code, the computation of interest should be reckoned from the presentation of the complaint on January 17, 1957 [5].

**DISPOSITION:** The decision appealed from is **MODIFIED**. The defendants are ordered to pay the sum of P5,000.00 with interest at the legal rate of 6% *per annum*, computed from the filing of the complaint on January 17, 1957 [5, 6].
