I. CAPTION
PEDRO C. PASTORAL v. MUTUAL SECURITY INSURANCE CORPORATION and THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-20469, August 31, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On October 1, 1957, Pedro C. Pastoral leased a crane to Mapada & Company, Inc. at a monthly rental of P900.00. The contract required Mapada to provide a surety bond. On October 22, 1957, Mutual Security Insurance Corporation executed a surety bond to guarantee Mapada's compliance. The bond contained a condition that Pastoral must report any violation of the lease contract to the surety within five (5) days, otherwise, the bond would be null and void. Pastoral only received a copy of the bond on November 21, 1957.

Mapada defaulted on the rentals for October and November. However, Pastoral had agreed to defer these payments until the end of November. When Mapada failed to pay by the end of November, Pastoral notified the surety on December 5, 1957. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Pastoral. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the decision, holding that the surety was exonerated because Pastoral failed to report the defaults that occurred in early October and November within the 5-day period stipulated in the bond.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the surety is released from liability due to the creditor's failure to notify of defaults within the 5-day period stipulated in the bond.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and reinstated the CFI judgment.

The Court ruled that the suretyship contract was not perfected and binding on Pastoral until November 21, 1957, when he received a copy of the bond and tacitly accepted it. Where a guaranty requires action by the creditor (in this case, reporting defaults) before the obligation becomes fixed, it is not binding until accepted (*National Bank vs. Garcia*; *Texas Co. [Phils.] Inc. vs. Alonso*).

Compliance with the 5-day notice requirement for the October and early November defaults was impossible because Pastoral did not know of the condition until November 21. *Ad impossibilia nemo tenetur* (No one is bound to do the impossible). Furthermore, contracts of suretyship are prospective unless a contrary intent is clearly shown; thus, the notice requirement did not apply to defaults prior to acceptance.

Regarding the timeliness of the notice, the extension Pastoral granted Mapada on October 31 wiped out previous defaults. The first default after the bond became effective (Nov 21) occurred at the end of November. Consequently, the notice given on December 5 was within the 5-day period. Finally, the Court noted that the rule of *strictissimi juris* (strict construction in favor of the surety) does not apply to compensated sureties (*United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. vs. Golden Pressed & Fire Brick Co.*).

The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and that of the Court of First Instance of Manila is upheld.
