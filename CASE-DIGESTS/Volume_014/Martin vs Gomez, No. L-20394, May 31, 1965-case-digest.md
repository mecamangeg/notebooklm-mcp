I. CAPTION
STEPHEN W. MARTIN v. CELESTINO GOMEZ, G.R. No. L-20394, May 31, 1965, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Celestino Gomez (appellant) obtained a writ of execution in a Manila case against one Paglinawan and levied on an Oldsmobile car found in the possession of Stephen Martin (appellee) in Baguio City. Martin filed a third-party claim asserting ownership. Gomez filed a bond to allow the Sheriff to retain possession and proceed with the sale. Martin then filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Baguio (Civil Case No. 669) to establish his ownership and secured a preliminary injunction to stop the sale. Consequently, the Sheriff kept the car in storage, incurring fees [1, 2].

The CFI of Baguio eventually declared Martin the lawful owner and ordered Gomez to pay storage fees as part of the costs. The Court of Appeals affirmed this decision [3, 4]. Upon execution, Martin submitted a Bill of Costs including P1,840.50 for storage fees. Gomez objected, arguing that storage fees are not included in the enumeration of costs under the Rules of Court [5, 6]. The lower court overruled the objection, prompting this appeal [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N storage fees for personal property in the sheriff's custody are taxable as costs against the defeated party.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order taxing storage fees as costs. Under Section 10(g), Rule 131 of the old Rules of Court (now Rule 142), the prevailing party may recover "lawful fees paid by him for the service of any process in action" [7]. Furthermore, Section 7(b), Rule 130 of the old Rules entitles sheriffs to a reasonable allowance for expenses necessarily incurred in caring for attached property [8].

The Court applied the doctrine in *Macondray & Co., Inc. v. Bernabe*, holding that proceedings for the execution of an order of attachment—including conserving and placing property under custody—constitute "service of any process." Therefore, sheriff's or custodian's fees for such services are recoverable as costs [9, 10]. The Court also noted that Gomez was equitably liable because his filing of a bond caused the Sheriff to retain custody of the car despite Martin's third-party claim [11, 12].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED.
