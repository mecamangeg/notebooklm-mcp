I. CAPTION
JOSE C. ZULUETA, in his capacity as Governor of Iloilo, as a Private Citizen, and/or Taxpayer v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, G.R. No. L-21997, May 27, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On July 19, 1961, the Office of the President issued an Unnumbered Provincial Circular ordering the disbanding of Secret, Confidential, and/or Special Agents of Provincial Governors and the desistance from appointing such agents [1]. On October 15, 1963, respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC), invoking its constitutional duty to maintain free, orderly, and honest elections, passed a Resolution adopting the contents of said Circular [2]. The Resolution ordered the confiscation of firearms possessed by such agents and commissioned the Philippine Constabulary (PC) for its enforcement [2].

Petitioner Jose C. Zulueta, then Governor of Iloilo, filed a petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Injunction with Preliminary Injunction against the COMELEC [3]. He argued that the Resolution was unconstitutional, denied due process, and deprived him of his power to maintain peace and order [3]. He further alleged that the original Circular was already the subject of a pending case (Civil Case No. 6406) in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, where an injunction had been issued restraining the PC from enforcing it [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the issues raised in the petition have become moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition. The Court held that "where the issues raised were already rendered moot and academic, further elucidation of the issues would no longer serve any practical and useful purpose" [4]. Consequently, the petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Injunction was dismissed [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
