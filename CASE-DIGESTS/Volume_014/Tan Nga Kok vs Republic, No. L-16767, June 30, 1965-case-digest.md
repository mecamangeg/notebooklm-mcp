I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF TAN NGA KOK TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. TAN NGA KOK v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-16767, June 30, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Tan Nga Kok, a Chinese citizen, filed a petition for naturalization. The Court of First Instance of Manila (Judge Cañizares) denied his application, citing material contradictions in his testimonial evidence regarding his age, yearly income, and family affairs. On appeal, the Supreme Court scrutinized two main obstacles: his income and his residence history [1]. Tan claimed a monthly income of P400.00, which he used to support himself, his mother, three brothers, and a sister [2]. Furthermore, while Tan stated in his petition and testimony that he resided at 666-B Rizal Avenue, the documentary evidence he submitted (certificates and exhibits) placed him at 676-680, 680, and 676 Rizal Avenue [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the failure to mention all places of residence in the petition is fatal to the application.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that a monthly income of P400.00 is not considered a lucrative occupation for an applicant who has to support a mother, three brothers, and one sister [2, 4]. The Court cited previous jurisprudence establishing that such a financial status is insufficient to meet the requirement of a lucrative income [5].

2. **YES.** The failure to mention all places of residence in the petition and in the declaration of intention is fatal to a petition for naturalization [2, 6]. The discrepancy between the address stated in the petition (666-B Rizal Avenue) and the addresses in the documentary evidence (676-680 Rizal Avenue) indicated that Tan either had multiple residences he failed to disclose or that his material allegations were untruthful [3]. This failure constitutes a sufficient ground to deny the petition [3].

**Decision affirmed.**
