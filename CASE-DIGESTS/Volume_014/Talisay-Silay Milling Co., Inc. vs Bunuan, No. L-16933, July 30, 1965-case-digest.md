I. CAPTION
TALISAY-SILAY MILLING COMPANY, INC. v. VICENTE G. BUNUAN, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-16933, July 30, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Talisay-Silay Milling Co. secured a judgment from the Court of First Instance of Manila commanding respondents (Sugar Quota Administrator) to sign warehouse receipt-permits for a reallocation of 28,798.80 piculs of domestic "B allotment" sugar for the 1956-1957 crop year. The Supreme Court affirmed this judgment. Petitioner then filed a Motion for Reconsideration and Clarification, arguing that the specific 1956-1957 receipt-permits had become obsolete during the pendency of the appeal [1, 2]. Petitioner requested that the relief be made effective by issuing permits for the *current* year against its *current* reserve ("C") sugars. Respondents opposed, arguing the case was moot because the 1956-1957 shortage had passed and the specific "C" sugar from that year was likely already used or unavailable [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner may utilize its current accumulated reserve ("C") sugar to fill the deficiency "B allotment" originally intended for the 1956-1957 crop year.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Under Section 1(a) of the Sugar Limitation Law (Act No. 4166), "C" sugar is held as an emergency reserve to make up deficiencies in other classes of sugar [4]. In the absence of such deficiency, unused "C" sugar must be carried over and added to the "C" sugar of succeeding years. These accumulated reserves are never separated or marked by year [4, 5]. Therefore, when a deficiency must be filled, any existing available reserve "C" sugar may be used regardless of the year it was produced [5, 6]. The Court ruled that it would be unjust to render the decision nugatory and leave the petitioner without redress simply because the appeal process consumed the time during which the specific 1956-1957 shortage existed [6].

The decision was **CLARIFIED**, ordering the Sugar Quota Administration to give full force to the reallocation by issuing domestic (B) warehouse receipt-permits for the *current* year against the *current* reserve (C) sugars of the petitioner [7].
