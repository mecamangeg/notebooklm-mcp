I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SIMPLICIO VILLANUEVA, G.R. No. L-19450, May 27, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On September 4, 1959, Simplicio Villanueva was charged with Malicious Mischief before the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Alaminos, Laguna. The complainant was represented by Ariston Fule, the City Attorney of San Pablo City, as private prosecutor. Fule had secured permission from the Secretary of Justice to appear, provided he was on official leave and received no compensation [1].

Counsel for Villanueva moved to inhibit Fule, arguing that as an Assistant City Attorney, he was barred from engaging in private law practice under Section 32, Rule 127 (now Sec. 35, Rule 138) of the Revised Rules of Court and the doctrine in *Aquino v. Blanco* [1, 2]. The JP Court upheld Fule's right to appear. On appeal, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Laguna affirmed the JP Court's order, ruling that Fule appeared not as a lawyer in a professional capacity but as an "agent or friend" of the offended party (a relative) as allowed in JP courts, and that his isolated appearance did not constitute private practice [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Assistant City Attorney engaged in the prohibited private practice of law by appearing as a private prosecutor for a relative in a Justice of the Peace Court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the isolated appearance of the Assistant City Attorney did not constitute the "private practice" of law prohibited by the statute.

The Court defined the "practice of law" as more than an isolated appearance; it implies frequent or customary actions and holding oneself out to the public as a lawyer available for compensation as a source of livelihood [4, 5]. In this case, Fule appeared with the permission of his superior, represented a relative, and did not receive compensation [5]. Furthermore, under Section 31, Rule 127 of the Rules of Court, a party in a Justice of the Peace Court may conduct litigation with the aid of an "agent or friend" [3]. Fule acted in this capacity and had no conflict of interest as the case was outside the jurisdiction of his office in San Pablo City [3].

The decision of the Court of First Instance is AFFIRMED [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Bautista Angelo, J. took no part) [6].
