I. CAPTION
PEDRO D. PAMINTUAN v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS and JOSE VALERIANO, G.R. No. L-19670, June 24, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Jose Valeriano filed an ejectment case against Pedro Pamintuan in the Municipal Court of Manila, which ruled in Valeriano's favor. Pamintuan was ejected but subsequently reoccupied the premises, leading to a contempt judgment and an order for an *alias* writ of execution. Pamintuan then filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 44410) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against Valeriano, the Judge, and the Sheriff, specifically styled as a suit "for injunction." He prayed to enjoin the execution, alleging he had a new contract with Valeriano to sell/lease the property.

The CFI dismissed Pamintuan's complaint. Pamintuan filed his notice of appeal and record on appeal 30 days after receiving notice of the decision. The CFI disapproved the record on appeal, ruling that the case was actually a petition for *certiorari* (challenging the Municipal Court's jurisdiction), which has a 15-day appeal period, rendering the judgment final. The Court of Appeals affirmed this view, dismissing Pamintuan's petition for mandamus.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner’s complaint was an action for injunction, making the 30-day appeal period applicable.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals. The Court held that the nature of an action is determined by the allegations in the pleadings. Pamintuan's complaint contained no allegations required for *certiorari* (e.g., lack of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion). Instead, it alleged facts peculiar to *injunction* (e.g., irreparable injury) and relied on the existence of a new contract.

Since the cause of action was for injunction, the period to appeal is thirty (30) days from notice. Furthermore, even if the complaint were ambiguous, the Rules of Court must be liberally construed to assist parties in obtaining a just determination of their causes. The interest of justice is served by allowing the perfection of the appeal within the longer period prescribed for injunction cases. The respondent Judge was directed to approve the record on appeal.
