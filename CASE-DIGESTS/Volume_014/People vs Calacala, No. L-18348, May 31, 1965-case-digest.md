I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CAMILO CALACALA, G.R. No. L-18348, May 31, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of December 22, 1959, during a Christmas dance in Rosales, Pangasinan, the victim, Domingo Corpus, became angry and disruptive after a dance partner excused herself [1], [2]. Appellant Camilo Calacala, the barrio lieutenant, approached Corpus and attempted to pacify him [2]. Later, Corpus returned, destroyed decorations, and grabbed the microphone from Calacala, pushing him aside [2]. Calacala fell, recovered, drew a pen knife, and repeatedly stabbed Corpus, who died from the wounds [1], [2]. Calacala surrendered immediately but claimed self-defense, alleging Corpus drew a gun on him [2], [3]. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan convicted Calacala of murder, qualified by treachery and aggravated by evident premeditation [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused acted in valid self-defense.
2. W/N the killing was qualified by treachery and evident premeditation to constitute murder.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court rejected the theory of self-defense as "unbelievable" [5]. The claim that the deceased drew a gun was not proven because no gun was found by police during a search of the scene immediately after the incident [3]. Although a gun was found the next morning under a tree, its ownership was not traced to the victim [3]. Furthermore, if the victim had a gun drawn as claimed, he would have likely fired or used it to bludgeon the accused; however, the accused did not receive even a bruise [6], [7]. Finally, the accused failed to mention any gun when he surrendered to the authorities [6], [7].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the crime committed was simple **Homicide**, not murder [7]. The qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation were not established beyond reasonable doubt. The Court found the testimony of the prosecution's sole eyewitness (a cousin of the victim) regarding a sudden, unprovoked attack to be incredible given the preceding altercation [8]. The accused had previously tried to pacify the victim, negating a plan to kill [8]. The Court modified the judgment, finding the accused guilty of Homicide mitigated by voluntary surrender [7].
