I. CAPTION
DOMINGA REBULLO v. NARCISO PALO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20751, July 30, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On September 13, 1958, Dominga Rebullo filed a complaint for Forcible Entry against Narciso Palo and others in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Tinambac, Camarines Sur [1]. Defendants' counsel made an oral answer during trial as the mailed written answer had not yet arrived; the JP Court ruled for Rebullo on November 12, 1958, receiving the written answer 12 days later [1]. Defendants appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) and filed a Manifestation adopting the written answer filed in the JP Court as their answer in the CFI [1]. However, the JP Court failed to forward the written answer with the records [2, 3]. Consequently, the CFI declared defendants in default and allowed Rebullo to present evidence *ex parte*, eventually rendering judgment in her favor [2, 4]. Defendants filed a Motion to Set Aside Order of Default and a Motion for Relief from Judgment, citing the JP’s failure to transmit their answer, but the CFI denied the motions [2, 3, 5]. The Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved purely legal issues [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendants are entitled to relief from the judgment of default due to the JP Court's failure to forward their answer to the CFI.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while the Rules allow for a declaration of default if an answer is not presented within the reglementary period, relief may be granted when the failure is occasioned by fraud, accident, mistake, and/or excusable negligence [6, 7]. Here, the default was based on a failure to answer in the CFI, yet there was in fact an answer filed in the JP Court which the JP failed to forward despite defendants' manifestation to reproduce it [6, 8]. The Court ruled that the non-admission of the answer and the hearing conducted in the defendants' absence amounted to a denial of their day in court [8].

The Order appealed from was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the CFI to admit the answer and proceed to trial [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
