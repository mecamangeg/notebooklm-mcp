I. CAPTION
**BASILIO UNSAY and ANTONIA MANALO v. HON. CECILIA MUÑOZ-PALMA, FELIZA DIAZ and DAVID LIWANAG**, G.R. No. L-17712, May 31, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Feliza Diaz and David Liwanag filed Civil Case No. 2798 in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal against petitioners Basilio Unsay and Antonia Manalo, along with co-defendants Marta Mendoza, Hilario Nonato, and Asuncion Tuason. The action sought to collect a sum of money and enforce a right of usufruct over parcels of land in Rizal. The defendants argued that the usufruct was not annotated on their Torrens Title and that they were purchasers in good faith.

The CFI rendered judgment ordering the defendants to deliver possession of the land to the plaintiffs for the duration of the usufruct. Only defendants Mendoza and Nonato appealed; petitioners Unsay and Manalo did not. After the judgment ostensibly became final as to the petitioners, the CFI issued a writ of execution ejecting them from the property. Petitioners moved to quash the writ, arguing that the appeal by their co-defendants suspended the finality of the judgment for all, as their defense (clean title) was common to all. The CFI denied the motion. The Court of Appeals dismissed petitioners' subsequent petition for certiorari, ruling the execution proper.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the action constituted a collateral attack on an indefeasible Torrens Title.
2. W/N execution against the non-appealing defendants (petitioners) is proper while the appeal of their co-defendants based on a common defense is pending.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The trial court had jurisdiction. The action was an ordinary one for collection of money and enforcement of a usufruct. The defense that the Torrens Title lacked an annotation of the usufruct does not divest the trial court of jurisdiction, nor does the complaint constitute a collateral attack against the indefeasible title [1].

2. **NO.** (With qualification). The Supreme Court applied the doctrine in *Municipality of Orion v. Concha*, stating that if the judgment against co-defendants depends on a question where the liability is not several but rests on a common defense, the appeal of one inures to the benefit of those who did not appeal [2]. Here, the right to retain the property depends on the validity of the defense regarding the clean Torrens Title, which applies to all defendants [3]. Therefore, execution regarding the usufruct/possession cannot issue against petitioners pending the co-defendants' appeal. However, execution may issue regarding the money judgment if the trial court held such liability to be several [4, 5].

**Decision affirmed with modification.** The order of execution regarding possession is annulled; execution on money judgment is permitted if liability is several [5].
