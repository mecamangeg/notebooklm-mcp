I. CAPTION
JAIME HERNANDEZ, Secretary of Finance, et al. v. EPIFANIO T. VILLEGAS and the HON. COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-17287, June 30, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Epifanio T. Villegas, a lawyer and civil service eligible, was appointed Director for Security of the Bureau of Customs in 1955 [1]. In 1957, upon returning from studies abroad, he was temporarily detailed to the Arrastre Service, while James Keefe was designated Acting Director for Security [2]. On January 9, 1958, Petitioner Secretary of Finance Jaime Hernandez proposed Villegas' permanent appointment as Arrastre Superintendent and Keefe's appointment as Director for Security, arguing the latter position was "confidential in nature" while the former was classified [2]. These appointments were approved by the Executive Secretary [3]. Villegas, unaware of the changes, discovered he had been "demoted" only in February 1958 and subsequently demanded reinstatement [3, 4]. He filed a petition for *quo warranto* with the Court of First Instance, which ruled in his favor, awarding reinstatement and backpay [5]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision [5]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the position of Director for Security is primarily confidential and, citing *De los Santos v. Mallare*, Villegas could be transferred or removed at the pleasure of the appointing power [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an officer holding a position characterized as primarily confidential may be removed or transferred without cause.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that officers and employees in the civil service, even those occupying primarily confidential positions, are subject to the Constitutional safeguard that "No officer or employee in the Civil Service shall be removed or suspended except for cause" (Phil. Const., Art. XII, Sec. 4) [6, 7].

The Court clarified that the statement in *De los Santos v. Mallare*, suggesting such appointments are terminable at will, is mere *obiter dictum* [8]. While the term of an official in a primarily confidential position expires upon "loss of confidence"—constituting an expiration of term rather than removal—tenure endures as long as confidence exists [8, 9]. In this case, Villegas' removal was concededly without cause and therefore illegal [7, 10].

**Decision affirmed.**
