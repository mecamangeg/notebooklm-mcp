I. CAPTION
JOAQUIN TAN alias TAN YAM LAI v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19897, June 24, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On February 16, 1960, Joaquin Tan filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Quezon [1]. The original petition failed to allege that Tan had filed a declaration of intention or that he possessed the qualifications to be exempt from filing one, as required by the Revised Naturalization Law [1, 2]. On May 12, 1960, Tan filed an amendatory petition adding allegations regarding his education to support an exemption [3]. However, unlike the original petition, this amendatory petition was never published [3, 4]. Despite the Provincial Fiscal's opposition citing the defect regarding the declaration of intention, the trial court granted the petition [3]. The Republic appealed [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the failure to publish the amendatory petition, which sought to cure the original petition's failure to allege compliance with the declaration of intention requirement, renders the application void.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The failure to publish the amendatory petition is fatal to the application [4]. Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law mandates that the petition must state compliance with the declaration of intention requirement (Section 5) or the specific grounds for exemption [5]. The failure to include these material allegations in the original petition rendered it void, as the public must be apprised of the reasons for exemption to properly object [6]. Since the original petition was void for lacking essential particulars, the amendatory petition filed to cure these defects should have been published anew in accordance with Section 9 of the Revised Naturalization Law [4].

The Order granting Philippine citizenship is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DISMISSED** [4].
