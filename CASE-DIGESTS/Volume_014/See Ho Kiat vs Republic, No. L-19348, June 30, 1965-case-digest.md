I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION AS CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. SEE HO KIAT, petitioner-appellee, vs. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, oppositor-appellant, G.R. No. L-19348, June 30, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner See Ho Kiat’s application for naturalization was granted by the lower court on July 21, 1959. However, he died on January 30, 1960, during the two-year probationary period required by Republic Act No. 530 and before he could take his oath of allegiance [1]. His widow, Ciriaca Lim, filed a manifestation to continue the proceedings and take the oath in his stead pursuant to Section 16 of the Revised Naturalization Law [2]. The Court of First Instance of Cebu declared her qualified to become a Filipino citizen [2]. The Government appealed, arguing that Lim must prove her own qualifications. Lim testified she had three minor children and an income consisting of a P120.00 monthly salary, a P120.00 occasional bonus, and P180.00 in monthly rentals [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a widow continuing her deceased husband’s naturalization proceedings must prove her own qualifications.
2. W/N the widow Ciriaca Lim met the lucrative income requirement.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that while Section 16 of the Revised Naturalization Law authorizes a widow to continue the proceedings, she must establish that she herself possesses all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications enumerated in Sections 2 and 4 of the law [4]. She cannot simply rely on her deceased husband's qualifications; she must prove her own eligibility to become a Filipino citizen [4].

2. **NO.** The Court found that Lim failed to prove she possessed a lucrative occupation. Her steady monthly income of P300.00 (P120.00 salary plus P180.00 rental) is not considered lucrative, especially considering she has three minor children to support [5]. The Court cited *Ong Ling Chuan v. Republic* and *Tan v. Republic*, noting that low income combined with the high cost of living fails to provide necessary economic stability [6, 7]. Her occasional bonus was excluded from the calculation as it was not steady and depended on the liberality of her employer [7]. Furthermore, Lim failed to prove other statutory requirements, such as her belief in the principles underlying the Constitution and lack of disqualification regarding organized government [8].

The resolution appealed from is hereby SET ASIDE [9].
