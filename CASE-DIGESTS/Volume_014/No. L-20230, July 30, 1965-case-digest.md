I. CAPTION
SHELL COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES, LIMITED v. COMPAÑIA GENERAL DE TABACOS DE FILIPINAS, MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-20230, July 30, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Shell Company of the Philippines (consignee) imported 10 drums of styrene monomer from the U.S., which arrived in Manila on May 6, 1960. On the same day, the consignee’s broker filed a provisional claim for damage/shortage with the Manila Port Service (arrastre operator), even before the goods were discharged. The goods were discharged to the arrastre on May 7, 1960. On May 19, 1960, the broker obtained a delivery permit from Customs, which was signed and bore a notice making it subject to the Arrastre Management Contract (limiting liability and requiring claims within 15 days of discharge). However, the goods were never delivered to Shell as they could not be located. Shell filed a suit for the value of the goods. The trial court ruled in favor of Shell, ordering the Manila Port Service to pay. The arrastre appealed, arguing Shell was bound by the Management Contract provisions which allegedly barred the claim.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Arrastre Management Contract is binding on the consignee who signs a delivery permit but fails to receive the goods.
2. W/N a provisional claim filed before the discharge of goods constitutes sufficient compliance with the claim-filing requirement of the Management Contract.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that while a consignee who signs a delivery permit and obtains partial delivery is generally bound by the Management Contract, this rule does not apply where the consignee completely fails to obtain delivery. Since Shell derived no benefit from the contract and the goods were never withdrawn from the piers, the provisions of the Management Contract, including its limitations on liability and claim prescriptive periods, are unenforceable against it. Sheer notice of the contract terms is insufficient to bind a consignee who does not make use of the delivery permit.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract specifically requires a claim to be filed "within fifteen (15) days from date of discharge." Consequently, a provisional claim filed *before* the goods are actually discharged from the carrying vessel is premature and speculative. Thus, even if the contract were binding, the claim filed on May 6 (prior to the May 7 discharge) would not have constituted valid compliance.

**Disposition:** Judgment affirmed.
