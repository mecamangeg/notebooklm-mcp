**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROMEO PAZ alias COMMANDER ROMY and SULPICIO TICA, G.R. No. L-17320, May 31, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
In 1956, victim Tranquilino Dayrit and his wife lived in Tanay, Rizal, near the house of accused Sulpicio Tica. Dayrit had previously denounced Tica to the army as a Huk supply officer and filed a complaint against him after Tica's carabao destroyed Dayrit's crops [1]. On December 7, 1956, Tica, accompanied by Huk Commander Romeo Paz and other armed men, went to Dayrit's house. They told Dayrit he needed to go with them to settle his case with Tica [2]. The group hogtied Dayrit, dragged him to the road, and stabbed him to death; Tica even removed one of the victim's eyes [3].

Tica and co-accused Castalone were tried first; Tica was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, while Castalone was acquitted [4], [5]. Paz was apprehended later and moved to quash the information, arguing the crime was committed in furtherance of rebellion and should be absorbed by it [6]. The trial court denied the motion, convicted Paz of murder, and sentenced him to life imprisonment [7]. Both appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the killing of Dayrit is absorbed by the crime of rebellion.
2. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over positive identification.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that if the killing is inspired by personal motive, such killing is not absorbed by rebellion but may be the subject of separate prosecution [8]. The evidence established that the killing was motivated by the private quarrel between Tica and Dayrit, with Tica utilizing the Huks to pursue his grudge [9], [10]. The defense failed to prove the killing was done in pursuance of rebellion [10]. The Court cited *People v. Geronimo*, distinguishing it from *People v. Hernandez*, to rule that personal crimes are distinct from political ones [8].

2. **NO.** Oral evidence of alibi cannot prevail over positive identification by witnesses who saw the accused at the scene and could not be mistaken because the accused were well-known to them [11]. The Court found Tica's alibi witnesses incredible due to convenient coincidences and lack of concrete evidence like time notations on subpoenas [11], [12]. Discrepancies in prosecution witnesses' testimonies regarding details were deemed to heighten credibility as they indicated a lack of coaching [13].

**Decisions affirmed.** [14]
