I. CAPTION
**REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AMPARO NABLE-LICHAUCO, JOSE LICHAUCO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18001, July 30, 1965, 14 SCRA 682, Bautista Angelo, J.**

II. FACTS
On July 6, 1957, the Land Tenure Administration (LTA) filed a complaint to expropriate "Hacienda El Porvenir," an agricultural land in Pangasinan owned *pro-indiviso* by defendants Amparo Nable Jose-Lichauco and Asuncion Nable Jose [1]. The defendants moved to dismiss, questioning the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 1400 and arguing there was no agrarian conflict to justify expropriation [2]. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan denied the motion and authorized the expropriation [3].

A Commission on Appraisal was constituted. The majority report valued the hacienda at P3,554,413.90, while the minority fixed it at P4,032,981.60 [4]. Disregarding both reports, the trial court rendered a decision fixing the value at P2,000.00 per hectare for the 9,113,191.5 square meter portion to be expropriated [4, 5]. The trial court based this valuation on the prices of distant haciendas, the tenants' buying power, and a previous compromise offer by the owners [6-8]. Both parties appealed the valuation [1, 6]. During the appeal, the LTA was abolished and superseded by the Land Authority under Republic Act No. 3844 [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the plaintiff has the authority to prosecute the expropriation despite the abolition of the LTA.
2. W/N the trial court correctly fixed the just compensation at P2,000.00 per hectare based on factors such as the tenants' buying power and compromise offers.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The issue is academic. The LTA was superseded by the Land Authority under Section 73 of Republic Act No. 3844. This new agency is expressly authorized to expropriate private agricultural lands where one-third of the tenants file a petition [9]. Thus, the plaintiff's authority to institute the action subsists.

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court considered improper factors in determining just compensation.
   
   First, the trial court erred in using the value of other haciendas (De Leon, Ongsiako, and Esperanza) as a basis, as these were located 19 to 100 kilometers away and were not comparable in nature [7]. 
   
   Second, the "buying power of the tenants" and tax exemptions are improper bases. The Court reiterated the principle established in *Broadway Coal Mining Company v. Smith* and *Olson v. U.S.* that "the value to the owner, or the loss caused to him, and not the value to the condemnor, is what needs to be taken into consideration" [8]. 
   
   Third, the owners' previous offer of P2,700,000.00 was inadmissible as it was a compromise offer made to avoid litigation and was never accepted [8].

   Instead, the Court adopted the valuation in the Majority Report of the Commissioners, which properly considered sales of similar adjacent lands around 1957, soil condition, accessibility, and improvements [10, 11]. The Court modified the judgment, fixing the fair market value at **P3,322.42 per hectare**, for a total sum of P3,027,784.80 [12].

   **Decision affirmed with modification.**
