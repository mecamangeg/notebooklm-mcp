I. CAPTION
BATANGAS TRANSPORTATION COMPANY, petitioner, vs. TEODORO VELANDO, ET AL., respondents., G.R. No. L-20675, June 23, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Teodoro Velando, a conductor for petitioner Batangas Transportation Company, filed a claim for compensation in May 1955 after contracting pulmonary tuberculosis and vomiting blood while on duty [1]. The Workmen's Compensation Commission initially denied the claim on August 16, 1955, finding the sickness was not work-connected [2]. Velando filed a first motion for reconsideration (MR) on September 10, 1955, which was denied on September 21, 1955 [2]. He filed a second MR on October 22, 1955, which was denied on December 16, 1955 [2].

More than eight months later, on August 29, 1956, Velando filed a third MR [2]. This time, the Commission reversed its previous rulings, and on September 25, 1962, ordered the petitioner to pay compensation and medical expenses [3]. The Commission *en banc* affirmed this award on December 10, 1962 [4]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the claim should not have been revived as the earlier dismissal had already become final and *res judicata* [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Workmen's Compensation Commission acted with grave abuse of discretion in entertaining a third motion for reconsideration filed long after the denial of previous motions.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the decision, ruling that the Commission acted with grave abuse of discretion bordering on lack of jurisdiction [5, 6].

The Court held that the decision of the Commission had long become final when it entertained the third motion for reconsideration [7]. Under Section 46 of the Workmen's Compensation Act and Rule 44, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, appeals must be perfected within the statutory period (10 days) [8]. While the rules of the Commission allow for a motion for reconsideration to interrupt this period, no more than one motion is allowed without express leave of court [8].

Here, the third motion was filed more than one year after the original decision and more than eight months after the denial of the second motion [2]. Although the Commission is not bound by technical rules of procedure, this "liberal spirit cannot be extended to a point where the Commission can no longer act for failure of the interested party to assert his right within the periods allowed" [9]. Consequently, the initial denial of the claim had acquired the status of *res judicata* [5].

The decision appealed from is reversed [6].
