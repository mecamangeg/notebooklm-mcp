I. CAPTION
NIN BAY MINING COMPANY v. MUNICIPALITY OF ROXAS, PROVINCE OF PALAWAN, G.R. No. L-20125, July 20, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
The Municipality of Roxas, Palawan enacted Ordinance No. 12, series of 1960, imposing an "inspection and verification fee" of P0.10 per ton of silica sand excavated within its jurisdiction and shipped out [1]. The ordinance required verification by municipal officials to ensure excavators had permits from the Bureau of Mines and did not encroach on other claims [1]. Nin Bay Mining Company (Nin Bay), which excavated and shipped silica sand, paid P3,042.40 under protest and filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to annul the ordinance and claim a refund [2]. The CFI ruled in favor of Nin Bay, annulling the ordinance and ordering the refund [2]. The Municipality appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipality of Roxas has the authority to impose the inspection and verification fee on silica sand excavations under Republic Act No. 2264 (Local Autonomy Act).

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. Section 2 of Republic Act No. 2264 grants chartered cities and municipalities the general authority to levy taxes, licenses, or fees for public purposes, subject only to specific exceptions enumerated in the law [3, 4]. The Court found that the tax on silica sand excavation does not fall under any of the exceptions listed in Section 2 [4]. Applying the rule *expressio unius est exclusio alterius*, the ordinance is deemed within the general grant of taxing power [4].

The Court noted that the legislative history of R.A. No. 2264 showed an intent to include mines and mining claims as objects of local taxation, as a provision originally excluding them was eliminated from the final bill [4]. Furthermore, the imposition is a valid exercise of police power, as public interest requires ensuring excavations are authorized and do not encroach on other claims [5]. Consequently, Sections 2287 and 2629 of the Revised Administrative Code, which limited such municipal powers, are considered repealed by R.A. No. 2264 as they are inconsistent with the broad authority granted by the new law [6].

The decision appealed from is reversed, and the case is dismissed [7].
