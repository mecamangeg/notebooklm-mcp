I. CAPTION
ROMAN F. DIONISIO v. SOCORRO FRANCISCO VDA. DE DIONISIO, G.R. No. L-18786, August 31, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Simplicio Dionisio died intestate without descendants or ascendants, leaving a parcel of land in Rizal. He was survived by his widow, Socorro (Respondent), and collateral relatives (brothers, nephews, and nieces). Under the Old Civil Code, the collateral relatives succeeded to the ownership of the property, while Socorro succeeded to a usufruct over one-half of the estate. The collateral relatives subsequently sold their shares to Roman Dionisio (Petitioner), making him the sole owner of the land subject to Socorro's usufruct [1-3].

Socorro filed an action for partition and damages in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal. The CFI ordered the partition of 5,544 square meters for Socorro's usufruct and the payment of P270.00 yearly as her share of the products [3, 4]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, ruling that while an owner generally has the option to satisfy the usufruct through other means, Roman allegedly failed to question Socorro's right to demand partition [4]. Roman appealed, asserting he did question the partition and that he should be allowed to satisfy the usufruct through other legal means [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the surviving spouse can compel the partition of the specific property to satisfy her usufructuary rights when the owner objects.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The surviving spouse cannot compel partition if the heir or owner chooses to satisfy the usufruct through other means provided by law.

Article 838 of the Old Civil Code provides three alternative ways for heirs to satisfy the usufructuary rights of a surviving spouse: (1) by a life annuity, (2) by the income from some specific property, or (3) by the payment of money [5]. Citing commentators Sanchez Roman and Manresa, the Court explained that the law grants the heirs (or the legal owner) the choice of how to satisfy the usufruct to avoid the burdens of co-administration [7, 8]. If the parties cannot agree, the judicial authority resolves the manner of payment [9, 10].

In this case, the Supreme Court held that the partition was improper because Roman opposed it and the law allows for alternative satisfaction. The Court determined that the payment of P270.00 yearly, representing Socorro's share in the income of the property as found by the trial court, suffices to satisfy her right of usufruct [10].

The petition was **GRANTED** in part. The judgment was modified to deny the demand for partition and instead order Roman Dionisio to pay Socorro P270.00 yearly beginning 1947 [11].
