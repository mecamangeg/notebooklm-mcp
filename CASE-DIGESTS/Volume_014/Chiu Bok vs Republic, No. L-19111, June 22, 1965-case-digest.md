I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. CHIU BOK alias DAVID CHIU v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19111, June 22, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Chiu Bok, a Chinese national born in 1913, arrived in the Philippines in 1930 and eventually settled in Dipolog, Zamboanga del Norte [1]. He is married with five children [1]. He operates a store known as "David Trading" and uses the alias "David Chiu" [1, 2]. In 1959, he filed a petition for naturalization, claiming a net income of P5,000 [3, 4]. However, his income tax returns revealed a progressively declining net income: P6,892 in 1957; P2,967.39 in 1958; P2,388.50 in 1959; and P2,098.78 in 1960 [4]. The Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Norte granted the petition [4]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that the petitioner lacked a lucrative income and violated the Anti-Alias Law [2, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner possesses a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the petitioner is disqualified due to the unauthorized use of an alias.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner does not possess a lucrative occupation. With a wife and five children to support, his income was not only low but progressively declining [5, 6]. The Court applied the doctrine in *Keng Giok v. Republic*, which held that an income of P8,000 for a family of the same size in Manila was not lucrative [7]. While the petitioner argued that the cost of living in Zamboanga is lower than in Manila, the Court noted that his actual income (dropping to approximately P2,000) was far below the standard, citing *Uy Ching No v. Republic* where an income of P7,799 in Dumaguete was deemed insufficient [7, 8].

2. **YES.** The petitioner is disqualified. The Court held that his use of the alias "David Chiu" without judicial authority was a clear violation of Commonwealth Act No. 142, the Anti-Alias Law [2, 5, 9]. This violation demonstrates that the petitioner is not a person of irreproachable character, a requirement for naturalization, as established in *Lim Bun v. Republic* [2].

The decision granting Philippine citizenship is **REVERSED**.
