I. CAPTION
**FERNANDEZ KIDPALOS, WALDO KIDPALOS, NABOS VALENCIANO, MAGLIA CAYAPA, SANDO LAMPACAN, BASATEN LAMPACAN, CONSING LAMPACAN and TOPAYNA LAMPACAN v. BAGUIO GOLD MINING COMPANY**, G.R. Nos. L-19940, L-19941, L-19942, L-19943, and L-19944, August 14, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In 1954, petitioners filed reivindicatory actions against respondent Baguio Gold Mining Company (Baguio Gold) to be declared owners of certain parcels of land in Itogon, Benguet, and to annul respondent’s mining claims [1]. The Court of First Instance (CFI) dismissed the complaints. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the dismissal, finding that the land was part of a forest reservation and that Baguio Gold had acquired a superior title through valid mining locations [2, 3]. The Supreme Court subsequently dismissed the petitioners' request for review in a 1960 resolution "without prejudice to the registration proceedings filed by petitioner... regarding the properties herein involved" [4].

During the pendency of the appeal, petitioners filed the subject applications for land registration covering the same properties [5]. After the 1960 Supreme Court resolution became final, Baguio Gold moved to dismiss the registration cases on the ground of *res judicata*. The CFI granted the motion and dismissed the applications [5]. Petitioners appealed, arguing that *res judicata* does not apply due to the "without prejudice" clause in the SC resolution and because the previous cases were reivindicatory while the current ones are for land registration [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the land registration applications on the ground of *res judicata* was proper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the dismissal was in order. Under the doctrine of *res judicata*, a difference in the form of action—such as between a reivindicatory suit and land registration proceedings—is irrelevant if the parties, subject matter, and causes of action are identical [7]. Since the petitioners asserted sole ownership in both the former and current cases, and the CA's final judgment declared Baguio Gold’s title superior, that finding is conclusive [7, 8]. The Court cited *Peñalosa v. Tuason* to establish that a different remedy does not prevent the estoppel of the former adjudication [7].

Regarding the "without prejudice" clause in the 1960 resolution, the Court explained that this merely meant the previous judgment in the personal action (reivindicatory) did not *automatically* decide the *in rem* registration proceedings [9]. However, *res judicata* is a matter of defense, and once Baguio Gold set it up in the registration proceedings, the trial court correctly applied it to dismiss the applications [9].

**Order affirmed.**
