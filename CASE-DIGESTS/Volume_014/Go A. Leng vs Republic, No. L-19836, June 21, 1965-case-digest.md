I. CAPTION
GO A. LENG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19836, June 21, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Go A. Leng, a Chinese citizen born in Amoy, arrived in the Philippines in 1938 and resided in Iloilo. On November 16, 1960, he filed a petition for naturalization [1]. He married Perla Pama How in 1961, and they have no children [2]. Petitioner works as Dean of Discipline and Assistant Property Custodian at the Iloilo Chinese Commercial School with a monthly salary of P200.00 [2]. He also claims part-time employment at a *bijon* factory owned by his brother-in-law, earning P100.00 monthly [2]. His wife earns P140.00 monthly as a teacher [2]. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo granted the petition, and the Republic appealed, challenging the lucrativeness of petitioner's income, his unauthorized use of an alias, and his failure to secure permission to renounce citizenship from the Chinese government [1, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner satisfies the requirement of a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the petition is defective due to the use of an alias and failure to secure permission from the Chinese Minister of Interior.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petitioner’s income is not lucrative [4, 5]. The Court disregarded the P100.00 part-time income because the factory belonged to his brother-in-law and the employment began only after the filing of the petition, indicating it was merely an accommodation for the case [4, 6]. Consequently, the joint monthly income of petitioner and his wife amounted to only P340.00 (P200.00 + P140.00) [4, 7]. Citing *Ong Ling Chuan v. Republic* and *Tan v. Republic*, the Court ruled that this amount is far from lucrative given the low purchasing power of the peso and the high cost of living [3, 5].

2. **YES.** The Court found valid grounds for objection in the petitioner's use of an alias without the authority required by Commonwealth Act No. 142 [3]. Furthermore, the petitioner failed to secure the permission of the Minister of Interior of China to change his nationality as required by Chinese law [3, 6, 7].

The decision appealed from is reversed [8, 9].
