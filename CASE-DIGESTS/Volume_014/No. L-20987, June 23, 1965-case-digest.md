I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE LAND-AIR-SEA LABOR UNION (PLASLU) v. CEBU PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY, G.R. No. L-20987, June 23, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners filed a case in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) demanding overtime compensation for security guards working on Saturdays, pursuant to the Forty Hours a Week Law (R.A. 1880). On March 17, 1960, the CIR issued an order denying the claim, relying on administrative opinions from 1957 which stated that security guards were not covered by the law [1]. This order became final and executory [2].

Two years later, Petitioners filed a petition to reopen the case under Section 17 of Commonwealth Act No. 103. They argued that subsequent rulings by the Office of the President (1960) and the Supreme Court (*Manila Port Service v. CIR*, 1961) had since classified security guards as covered by the benefits of R.A. 1880 [3]. The CIR denied the motion to reopen on the ground of *res judicata* [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the final order of the CIR may be reopened under Section 17 of C.A. 103 based on subsequent rulings incompatible with the original decision.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that while *res judicata* generally applies, Section 17 of C.A. 103 authorizes the CIR to modify or reopen an award at any time during its effectiveness. Citing *Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. v. Philippine Labor Organizations*, the Court ruled that a proceeding may be reopened upon grounds coming into existence *after* the order was rendered, provided these grounds were not available or litigated in the previous proceeding [5, 6].

Here, the administrative and judicial rulings extending 40-hour week benefits to security guards were issued in 1960 and 1961, after the original March 17, 1960 order [7]. These subsequent incompatible rulings constitute new grounds justifying a rehearing. However, relying on *Nahag v. Roldan*, the Court clarified that any new award must be limited to the period *subsequent* to the date of the previous order (March 17, 1960) and cannot affect the period already elapsed and covered by the final decree [8, 9].

The order denying the motion to reopen is REVOKED and the records are REMANDED for further proceedings.
