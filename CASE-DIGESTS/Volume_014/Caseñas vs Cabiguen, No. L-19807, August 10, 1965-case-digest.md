I. CAPTION
AGUSTIN O. CASEÑAS v. DIONISIO CABIGUEN, G.R. No. L-19807, August 10, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Dionisio Cabiguen applied for a Certificate of Public Convenience to operate a TPU service on the Puerto Princesa-Babuyan and Puerto Princesa-Panacan lines. Petitioner Agustin O. Caseñas, an existing operator on said lines, opposed the application, claiming his service was adequate and invoking the "prior operator rule" and "ruinous competition." The Public Service Commission (PSC) granted the application, finding that the lone existing service was inadequate for the progressive province of Palawan and that public necessity was paramount.

Petitioner received the decision on June 25, 1958, and filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) on July 10, 1958. The PSC denied this on January 18, 1960. On January 29, 1960, petitioner filed a Second MR without seeking leave of court, repeating previous grounds and adding a claim regarding the nullity of depositions. Without waiting for the resolution of the Second MR, petitioner filed the instant petition for review on June 1, 1962—nearly two years after the denial of the first MR [1-5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the second motion for reconsideration suspended the period to appeal to the Supreme Court.
2. W/N the factual findings of the Public Service Commission are binding on the Supreme Court.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Second Motion for Reconsideration did not suspend the period within which to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Court held that the motion was ineffective for tolling the appeal period because: (1) no leave to file a second motion was asked for or granted by the Commission; and (2) the motion was *pro forma*, merely repeating the grounds stated in the first motion. Consequently, the petition filed on June 1, 1962, was filed outside the reglementary period [5].

2. **YES.** The Court reiterated the doctrine that findings and conclusions of the Public Service Commission on factual matters—specifically whether there is a need for the service applied for and whether the applicant is financially capable—are conclusive and binding on the Supreme Court if they are based on documentary and substantial testimonial evidence. The Court found the PSC's decision was supported by evidence and refused to disturb it [6-8].

The decision of the Public Service Commission is AFFIRMED [9].
