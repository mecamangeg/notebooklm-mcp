I. CAPTION
DIONISIO B. GALLARDE v. CESAR S. MORAN and LIBORIA L. MORAN, G.R. No. L-19572, July 30, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On June 2, 1961, Dionisio Gallarde filed a complaint for "ejectment and damages" against the spouses Moran in the Court of First Instance of Agusan [1]. Gallarde alleged that the defendants occupied his urban land since 1954, promising to pay monthly rentals which were frequently irregular [1]. In January 1960, Gallarde notified them that starting March 1960, the rent would increase to P30.00, and if they were not "agreeable" to the new condition, he "made the demand against defendant to vacate" [1]. The defendants subsequently failed to pay rent.

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of cause of action, arguing that the complaint failed to allege a previous demand to vacate as required by Section 2, Rule 72 of the Rules of Court [2]. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint [2]. Gallarde appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the complaint established a cause of action for ejectment despite the lack of a definite demand to vacate.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the complaint failed to allege a cause of action under Section 2 of Rule 72 of the Rules of Court (in force in 1961) [3], [4].

The Rule provides that no landlord shall bring an action against a tenant for failure to pay rent or comply with lease conditions unless the tenant fails to do so for a period of fifteen days (for land) after demand is made personally, by written notice, or by posting [3]. The Court found the allegations in the complaint insufficient for two reasons:
1.  The first alleged demand was conditional ("if defendants were not agreeable"), and there was no allegation that defendants refused to agree [4].
2.  The second alleged demand was indefinite; it did not state *when* the demand was made, thus failing to show compliance with the 15-day waiting period before filing suit [4]. Furthermore, the complaint did not allege that the demand was made in the form required by law (personally, by written notice, or by posting) [4].

**Disposition:** The appealed order is affirmed, with costs against appellant [5].
