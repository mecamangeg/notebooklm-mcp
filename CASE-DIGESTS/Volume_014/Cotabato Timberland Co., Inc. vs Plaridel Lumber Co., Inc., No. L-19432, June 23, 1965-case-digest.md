I. CAPTION
COTABATO TIMBERLAND COMPANY, INC. v. PLARIDEL LUMBER COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-19432, June 23, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Defendant-appellee Plaridel Lumber Co., Inc. filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the Supreme Court's decision dated February 26, 1965. Plaridel argued that the damages awarded to plaintiff-appellant Cotabato Timberland Co., Inc. were excessive because the cost of production for the 551,663.84 board feet of logs—which Plaridel failed to turn over—was not deducted from the export price [1]. Plaridel contended that without this deduction, Cotabato would be unjustly enriched. The logs were cut under a right-of-way permit issued to Plaridel, which required the turnover of logs to Cotabato but did not explicitly provide for the deduction of production costs [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the cost of production should be deducted from the compensatory damages awarded to the licensee for logs unlawfully gathered from its area.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court denied the Motion for Reconsideration. The Court held that the right-of-way permit was subject to only one condition: that Plaridel turn over the logs to Cotabato; it did not provide for the deduction of production costs [1]. Furthermore, **Section 1837 of the Revised Administrative Code** expressly provides that when forest products unlawfully gathered from a licensed area are seized and delivered to the proper licensee, they are free from any claim [2]. The Court interpreted this provision to explicitly free the offended licensee from any claim, which includes the cost of production [2, 3]. Finally, the Court noted there was no evidence presented regarding the cost of production, and allowing such a deduction would unjustly enrich Plaridel, who had invaded Cotabato's licensed area [4].

Motion to reconsider is **DENIED** [4].
