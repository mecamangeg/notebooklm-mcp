I. CAPTION
SOLEDAD L. LACSON, ET AL. v. ABELARDO G. DIAZ, G.R. No. L-19346, May 31, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
In 1947, the Court of First Instance rendered a decision in Civil Case No. 5790 ordering Abelardo G. Diaz to pay Soledad L. Lacson, et al. the sum of P97,532.93 plus interest and attorney’s fees [1]. This judgment arose from a contract entered into by Diaz during his first marriage [2]. Diaz became a widower in 1951 and remarried in 1960 [3].

On August 1, 1961, a writ of execution was issued to satisfy the judgment. The Sheriff garnished one-third of Diaz’s monthly salary from Talisay-Silay Milling Company and other personal properties [1]. Diaz filed a motion to quash the writ and lift the garnishment, arguing that because the judgment debt arose during his first marriage, it could not be enforced against his salaries, which form part of the conjugal partnership of his second marriage [2]. The trial court denied the motion for lack of merit [2]. Diaz appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the conjugal partnership assets of the second marriage (specifically the husband's salary) can be garnished to satisfy a personal debt contracted by the husband prior to said marriage.

IV. RULING
**NO**, unless specific requisites are met. Under Article 163 of the New Civil Code, the general rule is that the payment of debts contracted by the husband or wife before the marriage shall not be charged to the conjugal partnership [4].

However, such debts may be enforced against the partnership assets if two conditions concur: (1) the responsibilities enumerated in Article 161 of the New Civil Code (e.g., family support) have already been covered; and (2) the obligor spouse has no exclusive property or it is insufficient [4, 5]. Since the enforceability against conjugal assets is an exception to the general rule, the burden of proof lies with the creditor to show that these requisites are present [5].

In this case, while the debt is undisputed, the plaintiffs-appellees (creditors) failed to establish that Diaz had no exclusive property or that the responsibilities of his second marriage under Article 161 had been covered [5].

The case was REMANDED to the court of origin for further proceedings to determine if the requisites for the exception apply [6].
