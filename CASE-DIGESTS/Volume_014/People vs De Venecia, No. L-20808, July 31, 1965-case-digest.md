I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BRAULIO DE VENECIA, G.R. No. L-20808, July 31, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Braulio de Venecia, a classified civil service employee, was prosecuted for electioneering for distributing handbills soliciting votes for Felipe Oda, the Nacionalista Party candidate for Mayor of Binalonan, during the November 10, 1959 elections [1, 2]. De Venecia filed a motion to quash the information, arguing that Section 54 of the Revised Election Code (REC), which penalizes active intervention of public employees in elections, had been repealed by Section 29 of Republic Act No. 2260 (The Civil Service Act of 1959) [3]. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan granted the motion and dismissed the case, ruling that the REC provision was indeed repealed [3]. The Government appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Section 54 of the Revised Election Code was repealed by Section 29 of Republic Act No. 2260.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that Section 54 of the Revised Election Code was not repealed by Section 29 of Republic Act No. 2260 [4, 5]. Section 54 is a penal statute prohibiting classified civil service employees from aiding candidates, while Section 29 is an administrative measure that allows employees to express views on political issues or mention candidates they support [6]. The Court held that Section 29 serves as an exception to Section 54 and must be strictly construed [7]. De Venecia's act of distributing handbills urging voters to elect a specific candidate constituted "solicitation" and "aiding," which exceeds the mere expression of views allowed under the Civil Service Act [8]. Therefore, his actions remain punishable under Section 54 of the Revised Election Code [9].

The Order of the lower court was **REVERSED** and the record was **REMANDED** for further proceedings [9].
