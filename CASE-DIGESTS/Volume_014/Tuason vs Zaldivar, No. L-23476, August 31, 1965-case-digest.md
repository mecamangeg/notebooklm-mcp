I. CAPTION
ARISTOTLE TUASON v. HON. CALIXTO O. ZALDIVAR, HON. SALVADOR MARINO, and HON. EULALIO PICHAY, G.R. No. L-23476, August 31, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tuason served as Municipal Judge of San Ildefonso, Ilocos Sur, from 1957 to 1960, and was subsequently appointed ad interim Municipal Judge of Vigan. Administrative charges were filed against him by Auxiliary Judge Francisco Ante. The charges included erroneous application of penalties, using improper bond forms, and specifically, discharging the functions of Municipal Judge of San Ildefonso and Municipal Councilor of Vigan during the same period and collecting emoluments for both positions. Following an investigation by the Court of First Instance, the President issued Administrative Order No. 108, finding Tuason guilty of mistakes and indiscretion reflecting adversely on his capacity, and separating him from service. Tuason filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition to annul the order, arguing the causes were insufficient and pertained to acts committed prior to his confirmation as Judge of Vigan.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Administrative Order separating the petitioner from service should be annulled.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the writ and dismissed the petition. The Court ruled that while individual counts might seem minor, their "collective effect" was sufficient to justify the administrative action. Specifically, the petitioner's act of discharging functions as both judge and councilor simultaneously, and collecting emoluments for both, disclosed a "deficiency in the prudence, discretion and judgment that a member of the judiciary must exercise" [1].

Furthermore, the Court held that the fact that these acts occurred prior to his assumption of office in Vigan, or that he was confirmed by the Commission on Appointments despite them, did not detract from the adverse effect of his previous behavior upon his fitness to continue in office [2]. The Court maintained it would not interfere with the Executive Department's exercise of power within its own sphere unless there is a clear violation of law [1].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Dizon and Zaldivar took no part.
