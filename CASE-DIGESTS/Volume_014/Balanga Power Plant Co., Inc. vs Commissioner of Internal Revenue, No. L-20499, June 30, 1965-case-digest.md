I. CAPTION
BALANGA POWER PLANT CO., INC., petitioner, vs. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, respondent., G.R. No. L-20499, June 30, 1965, Concepcion, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner is a Filipino corporation and grantee of six municipal franchises to operate electric power plants in Bataan, specifically in Balanga, Samal, Orion, Abucay, Pilar, and Orani [2-4]. The franchises for Balanga and Samal were granted under Act No. 667 [3]. These franchises fixed the franchise tax rate at 1% of gross earnings for the first 20 years and 2% for the remaining 15 years [5].

Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed petitioner for deficiency franchise tax covering the period from October 1, 1953, to June 30, 1957, in the amount of P26,253.04 [6]. The assessment was based on the 5% rate prescribed in Section 259 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), as amended, which petitioner challenged [6, 7]. Petitioner argued that applying the 5% rate impaired the obligation of contracts, as it exceeded the 2% rate stipulated in its municipal franchises [8, 9]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the CIR's assessment, ruling that the franchises granted under Act No. 667 are subject to Congress's power to alter or repeal [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the 5% franchise tax prescribed by Section 259 of the National Internal Revenue Code applies to petitioner's municipal franchises despite the lower rates provided in said franchises. [7, 10]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The 5% franchise tax applies. Section 259 of the NIRC mandates the collection of a tax of 5% or the rate specified in the special charter, "whichever is higher," unless the charter precludes the imposition of a higher tax [10].

The Court held that the application of Section 259 does not violate the constitutional injunction against the impairment of contractual obligations [4]. The franchises for Balanga and Samal were granted under Act No. 667, Section 5 of which expressly subjects such grants to the power of Congress to "alter, modify or repeal" [8, 11]. Consequently, when Congress amended the NIRC to impose a higher tax rate, it merely exercised this reserved power [12]. The amendment acted *in conformity* with the franchise terms rather than in violation of them [12]. Regarding the other franchises (Orion, Abucay, Pilar, and Orani), petitioner failed to establish their contents, preventing any finding of impairment [4].

The Court applied the doctrine in *Hoa Hin Co. v. David*, ruling that municipal franchises are not superior to legislative franchises and are equally subject to the rates in Section 259 [13, 14].

The decision appealed from is hereby affirmed. [15]
