I. CAPTION
RODOLFO O. TIRONA v. M. CUDIAMAT, as City Treasurer of Manila, G.R. No. L-21235, May 31, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rodolfo O. Tirona, an original holder of a backpay certificate (Acknowledgment No. 8506) issued under Republic Act No. 897, offered said certificate to respondent City Treasurer of Manila, M. Cudiamat, on June 28, 1962, to pay his realty taxes for the year 1962 amounting to P1,887.90. The respondent refused to accept the certificate based on a directive from the City Mayor prohibiting acceptance because the City had accumulated a large amount of unredeemed certificates, affecting its finances. Tirona filed a petition for mandamus with the Court of First Instance of Rizal to compel acceptance. The lower court ruled in favor of Tirona. Respondent appealed, arguing that under R.A. No. 304 as amended by R.A. No. 897, certificates are only admissible for obligations subsisting at the time of the Act's approval (June 20, 1953), whereas the taxes here were for 1962.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the City Treasurer can be compelled to accept backpay certificates in payment of realty taxes that accrued after the approval of Republic Act No. 897.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the City Treasurer is mandatorily required to accept the backpay certificate.

The Court interpreted Section 2 of Republic Act No. 304, as amended by Republic Act No. 897. While the law limits the application of certificates for "obligations" to those subsisting at the time of the Act's approval, this limitation does not apply to the payment of "(2) his taxes" or "(3) government hospital bills," which are listed separately without such temporal restriction [1, 2]. If the legislature intended the time limit to apply to taxes, it would have repeated the qualification. Furthermore, Section 5 of R.A. 897 does not restrict military backpay holders from using certificates for taxes; to hold otherwise would discriminate against them compared to other holders [3, 4].

The Court also ruled that the duty to contribute to the sinking fund for redemption is distinct from the obligation to accept the certificates. Upon acceptance, the City is merely subrogated to the right to demand reimbursement from the National Government [4]. Finally, a City Mayor cannot validly countermand a duty enjoined by law [5, 6].

**Decision affirmed.**
