I. CAPTION
BERT R. BAGANO v. THE DIRECTOR OF PATENTS and THE INTERNATIONAL PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., G.R. No. L-20170, August 10, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Bert R. Bagano filed an application for the registration of the trademark "Efficascent Oil" on June 23, 1959, claiming use since December 1958. Respondent International Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IPI) also filed an application for the same trademark on August 17, 1958. The Director of Patents conducted interference proceedings to determine priority of adoption and use.

IPI presented evidence showing that its predecessor-in-interest, Miguel K. Chiong, had been manufacturing a product called "EFFICOL" since 1948, which was renamed "EFFICASCENT OIL" in 1949 with the approval of the Board of Pharmaceutical Examiners. Chiong sold the formula and rights to the Wong brothers (who formed IPI) in 1959. IPI submitted government permits and sales invoices proving continuous use since 1949. In contrast, Bagano failed to present a permit to manufacture and his wife was found to be a former employee of Chiong, suggesting knowledge of the prior product.

The Director of Patents ruled in favor of IPI, rejecting Bagano's application. Bagano appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that IPI’s evidence was hearsay and self-serving.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N International Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has priority of adoption and use of the trademark "Efficascent Oil."

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Director of Patents. The Court held that the Director's finding that IPI had priority of adoption and use was a conclusion of fact fully supported by documentary and testimonial evidence, specifically the government permits and sales invoices dating back to 1949 [1].

Under the doctrine of conclusiveness of findings, when the Director of Patents makes findings of fact that are supported by the evidence, such findings are binding upon the Supreme Court [2, 3]. The Court also noted that Bagano's claim of use only began in 1958, whereas IPI's predecessor had been using the mark since 1949, giving IPI the better right to registration [1, 4].

The decision appealed from was affirmed [5].
