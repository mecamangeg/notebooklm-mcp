I. CAPTION
ILUMINADA SANTIAGO, ET AL. v. THE HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, VALENTIN A. FERNANDO and SHERIFF OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-19508, August 14, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Valentin Fernando filed an ejectment case in the City Court of Manila against petitioners (Iluminada Santiago, et al.) for non-payment of rentals on market stalls. Fernando’s daughters intervened, claiming ownership of the stalls via a donation from Fernando [1, 2]. The petitioners sought to interplead the parties to settle the ownership issue [2]. The City Court found that the issue of ownership was directly involved and declared itself without jurisdiction [3, 4]. However, in its dismissal order, the City Court still directed the petitioners to pay rentals to Fernando and the City Treasurer [3]. No party appealed, and the decision became final [5]. When Fernando moved for execution, petitioners filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, questioning the City Court's jurisdiction to order rent payment [5]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the City Court acted within its equity powers [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the City Court has jurisdiction to order the payment of rentals after dismissing an ejectment case because the issue of ownership was involved.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that where the ownership of the property is involved, the municipal court has no jurisdiction in hearing an ejectment case and may not order the payment of rentals [7, 8]. The Court reiterated the doctrine that when ownership is directly interwoven with a forcible entry or detainer case, the inferior court has no jurisdiction (citing *Songahid v. Cinco*, *Teodoro v. Balatbat*, and *Juzon de Po v. Moscoso*) [4, 9].

Since the City Court lacked jurisdiction due to the ownership dispute, the fact that neither party appealed the decision is of no moment [7, 10]. The lack of jurisdiction was properly raised in the petition for prohibition against the writ of execution [7, 10]. Consequently, the order requiring payment of rentals was void. The petition was granted.
