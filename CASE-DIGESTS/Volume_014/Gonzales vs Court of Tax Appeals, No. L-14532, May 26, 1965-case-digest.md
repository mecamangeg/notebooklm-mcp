I. CAPTION
JOSE LEON GONZALES and JUANA G. GONZALES v. THE HON. COURT OF TAX APPEALS and THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. Nos. L-14532 & L-14533, May 26, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Jose and Juana Gonzales were co-owners of a tract of land in Caloocan expropriated by the government. In 1954, they received the expropriation proceeds, which included P89,309.61 each representing interest on the value of the land. The Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed this interest as ordinary income, and income taxes of P86,166.00 were withheld and paid for each petitioner on November 19, 1954.

In February and November 1956, petitioners filed administrative claims for refund of P24,426.00 each, arguing that the interest should have been taxed as capital gain rather than ordinary income. The CIR denied the claims. On November 15 and 16, 1956, petitioners filed suits with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). Subsequently, on November 24, 1956, Juana’s counsel sent a letter claiming a refund of the entire P86,166.00 tax paid. The CTA denied the petitions.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claim for refund of the total P86,166.00 is barred.
2. W/N interest received from expropriation proceedings is taxable as capital gain.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The claim for the total P86,166.00 is barred due to prescription and failure to comply with statutory requirements. Section 306 of the National Internal Revenue Code mandates that a written claim for refund must be filed with the Collector *before* filing a suit in court and within two years from the date of payment. Here, the tax was paid on November 19, 1954. The expanded claim for P86,166.00 was made only on November 24, 1956—beyond the two-year period—and after the court action had already been filed. Consequently, the Court only considered the timely claim for P24,426.00.

2. **NO.** The interest is taxable as ordinary income, not capital gain. While the acquisition of property through eminent domain is considered a sale where profits are capital gains, the interest paid is not part of the price. The Court, citing *Kieselbach v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*, explained that interest is compensation for the delay in the payment of the value of the property (the capital). It constitutes income paid in lieu of what the owners might have earned on the sum found to be the value of the property at the time it was taken. Thus, it falls under Gross Income derived from "interest" under Section 29 of the Tax Code.

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed.
