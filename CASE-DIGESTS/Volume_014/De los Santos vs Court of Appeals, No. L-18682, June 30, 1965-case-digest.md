I. CAPTION
NICOLAS DE LOS SANTOS v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, SANTIAGO K. BAUTISTA and EDUARDO MENDIGORIA, G.R. No. L-18682, June 30, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In 1949, respondent Mendigoria executed a chattel mortgage on a house to secure a loan from petitioner De los Santos. Mendigoria subsequently sold the house to respondent Bautista. In 1958, De los Santos attempted to extrajudicially foreclose on the mortgage. Respondents filed an action to enjoin the foreclosure, alleging payment of the loan [1]. After respondents presented their evidence, De los Santos filed a motion to dismiss (demurrer to evidence) claiming insufficiency of evidence, but he did not make a reservation to present his own evidence if the motion was denied [2]. The trial court denied the motion and simultaneously rendered a decision permanently enjoining the foreclosure [2]. De los Santos moved for reconsideration to allow him to present evidence, which was denied. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is entitled to present evidence after his demurrer to evidence was denied despite having made no reservation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that under the jurisprudence applicable prior to the effectivity of the 1964 Revised Rules of Court, a defendant who filed a demurrer to evidence without any reservation effectively submitted the case for decision based solely on the plaintiff's evidence [4]. If the result is adverse, the defendant cannot claim, as a matter of right, that the decision be vacated to allow him to adduce evidence [5]. The Court cited *Municipality of Abucay vs. Abucay Plantation Co.*, establishing that filing such a motion without reservation constitutes a waiver of the right to present evidence [6], [7]. The Court distinguished this from *Guido vs. Castelo*, where an express reservation was made [8]. Although Rule 35, Section 1 of the 1964 Revised Rules now allows a defendant to present evidence if the demurrer is denied, the case at bar was governed by the previous doctrine [9].

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [9], [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Dizon, J., concurred in the result [9].
