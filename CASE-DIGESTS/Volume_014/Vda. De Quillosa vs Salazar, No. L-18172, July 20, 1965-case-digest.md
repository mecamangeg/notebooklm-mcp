I. CAPTION
ROSA BUNGAY VDA. DE QUILLOSA, AURORA QUILLOSA DE PALMIANO, and RICARDO QUILLOSA v. TARCILA SALAZAR, G.R. No. L-18172, July 20, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On April 12, 1956, Martin L. Quillosa filed Civil Case No. 1264 against respondent Tarcila Salazar for declaration of ownership of a parcel of land and annulment of TCT No. 1447, alleging forgery of the deed of sale [1]. Salazar moved for a bill of particulars, which the trial court granted [2]. Martin failed to comply, leading the court to strike out the complaint and subsequently dismiss the case on July 21, 1956 [3]. Martin died shortly thereafter, but no substitution was made [4].

On June 29, 1957, petitioners (Martin's heirs) filed Civil Case No. 1529 against Salazar based on the same cause of action [4, 5]. Salazar moved to dismiss on the ground of *res judicata*. The trial court granted the motion, ruling that the dismissal of the first case was an adjudication on the merits [5, 6]. Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court on a pure question of law [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the first complaint for failure to submit a bill of particulars constitutes *res judicata* barring the subsequent action.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The dismissal of the first case operates as an adjudication on the merits.

The Court held that the failure of the plaintiff to comply with the order requiring him to submit a bill of particulars is a ground for dismissal under Section 3, Rule 30 of the old Rules of Court (now Section 3, Rule 17 of the Revised Rules) [7, 8]. The rule explicitly states that such dismissal "shall have the effect of an adjudication upon the merits, unless otherwise provided by the court" [7]. Since the dismissal order in Civil Case No. 1264 did not contain a proviso that it was without prejudice, it bars future litigation on the same matter [6, 8].

All elements of *res judicata* were present: (1) a final order deemed a judgment on the merits; (2) jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties; and (3) identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action [9]. The petitioners, suing as heirs, are identical in interest to the original plaintiff [9].

The order appealed from is affirmed [10].
