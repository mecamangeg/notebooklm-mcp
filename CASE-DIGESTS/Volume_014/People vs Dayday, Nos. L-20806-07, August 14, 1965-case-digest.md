I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ALEJANDRO DAYDAY alias ANDO, DAMIANO BARTON alias DAMIN and SANTOS SINODLAO alias MAN ANINGA**, G.R. Nos. L-20806-07, August 14, 1965, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On May 16, 1960, in Talakag, Bukidnon, appellants Alejandro Dayday, Damiano Barton (Damin), and Santos Sinodlao (Man Aninga) conspired to kill spouses Simplicio Litan and Crispina Likayan to kidnap their children, Nilda (4) and Yolanda (2), intending to sell them to Moros [1, 2]. Dayday also sought revenge against the victims' relative who had killed his brother [1]. Armed with bolos and a rifle, the three accused attacked the spouses at night in their farmhouse, hacking and stabbing them to death [3, 4]. They took the children, but Dayday and Damin killed Nilda on the way because she was severely wounded and burdensome [3, 5].

Following their arrest, the accused executed extrajudicial confessions before the Municipal Mayor and Justice of the Peace, detailing the crime and leading authorities to the weapons and Nilda’s body [6, 7]. At trial, they repudiated these confessions, claiming they were forced to sign documents in a dialect they did not understand, and interposed the defense of alibi [8]. The Court of First Instance of Bukidnon convicted them of the complex crime of Kidnapping with Murder and sentenced them to death [9]. The case was elevated to the Supreme Court for automatic review [10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the extrajudicial confessions are admissible despite the accused's repudiation.
2. W/N the defense of alibi should prosper.
3. W/N the death penalty is proper despite the accused's alleged "backwardness" and location in the hinterlands.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The accused could not convincingly deny knowledge of the contents of their confessions. The evidence showed the statements were translated and explained to them in their native *Binukid* dialect by the Municipal Mayor, and they affirmed the contents before the Justice of the Peace [11, 12]. Furthermore, the confessions contained precise details—such as the specific location where the child's body was thrown and the missing flashlight cap found at the scene—which the police could not have concocted [7, 11, 13].

2. **NO.** Alibi is generally a weak defense as it is easy to concoct and must be viewed with caution [14, 15]. Dayday’s alibi was uncorroborated, while the other appellants' alibi was supported by a witness whose alleged supervisors were never presented to testify [10, 15]. Such weak defenses cannot prevail over the positive details found in their confessions [7].

3. **YES.** The Court rejected the defense argument that the death penalty should not be imposed due to the accused's "backwardness" or residence in the hinterlands. The crime of murder committed in the hinterlands is just as serious as if perpetrated in cities or other parts of the country [14, 16]. The law applies uniformly to all within the jurisdiction [17].

**Judgment affirmed.**
