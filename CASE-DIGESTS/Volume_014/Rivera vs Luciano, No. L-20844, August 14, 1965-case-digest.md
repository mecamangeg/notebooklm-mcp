**I. CAPTION**
ANGELITA F. RIVERA v. LORETO LUCIANO, G.R. No. L-20844, August 14, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
On May 16, 1962, Angelita F. Rivera filed Civil Case No. 50408 against Loreto Luciano in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to collect P5,862.60 [1]. On June 9, 1962, the trial court dismissed the case upon Luciano's motion because her husband was not joined as a defendant [1]. Rivera did not appeal this dismissal [1].

On August 14, 1962, Rivera filed a second action, Civil Case No. 51262, against the same defendant for the same subject matter and cause of action, seeking P5,897.60 [2]. Luciano moved to dismiss the second case, arguing it was barred by the dismissal of the previous case [2, 3]. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the case [3]. Rivera appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the dismissal of the first case (Civil Case No. 50408) for non-joinder of a party constitutes an adjudication on the merits that bars the filing of the second case (Civil Case No. 51262).

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** Under Section 4, Rule 30 of the old Rules of Court, any dismissal not provided for in the rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, operates as an adjudication upon the merits unless otherwise ordered by the court [4].

The Court held that the dismissal of the first case was not for lack of jurisdiction, nor did the trial court expressly order the dismissal to be "without prejudice" [5]. Consequently, the dismissal served as an adjudication on the merits [5]. Since that order became final, it bars the filing of another action on the same cause of action [5].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [5].
