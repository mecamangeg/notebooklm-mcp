I. CAPTION
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MANUEL S. OZARRAGA, as administrator of the Intestate Estate of LEON CUÑAT, G.R. No. L-16631, July 20, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Leon Cuñat incurred an indebtedness of P800.00 to the Agricultural and Industrial Bank (now DBP) on August 7, 1941, secured by a mortgage on his land [1]. The loan was payable in five yearly installments, the last falling due on August 7, 1946 [1]. Cuñat died in 1942 without making any payments [1]. The debt moratorium was lifted by Republic Act No. 342 on July 26, 1948, marking the start of the ten-year prescriptive period [1]. On July 18, 1958, DBP filed a petition for the appointment of an administrator for Cuñat's estate [2]. On July 13, 1959, DBP filed the complaint for foreclosure against the administrator, Manuel Ozarraga [1, 3]. The Court of First Instance of Agusan dismissed the complaint, ruling that the action had prescribed [3]. DBP appealed, arguing that the prescriptive period was interrupted by the petition for administration and by written extrajudicial demands sent to the decedent and his heirs [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the filing of a petition for the appointment of an administrator interrupts the running of the prescriptive period for a foreclosure action.
2. W/N written extrajudicial demands interrupted the prescription of the action.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A petition to open an administration proceeding over the estate of a deceased debtor, even if brought by the creditor, does not discharge the function of an action to enforce the debt. Therefore, it does not interrupt the prescription of an action to foreclose a mortgage [2].

2. **NO.** The prescription of the action is governed by the law in force prior to the New Civil Code, which was Act No. 190. Under Article 1116 of the New Civil Code, prescription already running before the new Code became effective is governed by laws previously in force [5]. Since the prescriptive period began on July 26, 1948, the old law applies. Under Section 50 of Act No. 190, a written extrajudicial demand for payment was not a ground to renew a right of action or interrupt prescription, unlike under Article 1155 of the New Civil Code [5]. Consequently, the demand letters had no effect on the running of the period.

The Order of the lower court dismissing the complaint is affirmed [6].
