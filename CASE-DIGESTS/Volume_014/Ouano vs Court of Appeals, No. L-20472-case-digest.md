I. CAPTION
MARIO P. OUANO and LETICIA O. ARNAIZ v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, HON. AMADOR E. GOMEZ, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Cebu, and ANTONIO MA. CUI, G.R. No. L-20472, May 31, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Anunciacion P. Vda. de Ouano, administratrix of the Intestate Estate of Damian M. Ouano, filed a petition in July 1961 for authority to sell the estate's share in four parcels of land. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu initially authorized the sale of a one-half undivided share to respondent Antonio Ma. Cui for P155,000.00. However, Cui claimed his bid covered the entire four parcels. The CFI sustained Cui’s position and ordered the sale of the four parcels for the same amount [1].

Petitioners Mario Ouano and Leticia Arnaiz, heirs of the decedent, moved for reconsideration, arguing there was a higher offer of P270,000.00 from another party. The CFI denied their motion and subsequently rejected their Notice of Appeal, ruling that as heirs, they had no legal standing to interfere with the administration and that the administratrix had already appealed the order [2, 3]. Petitioners filed a petition for Mandamus with the Court of Appeals (CA) to compel the CFI to give due course to their appeal. The CA dismissed the petition, affirming that petitioners lacked legal standing [3]. Petitioners then appealed to the Supreme Court.

During the pendency of the appeal, the administratrix moved to withdraw her original petition for authority to sell, which the CFI granted on March 25, 1964 [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed for being moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the present case was merely an incident to the administratrix's petition for authority to sell filed on July 24, 1961. Since the lower court had already allowed the withdrawal of the underlying petition for authority to sell, the issues involved in the petitioners' appeal became moot and academic [5].

Appeal dismissed.
