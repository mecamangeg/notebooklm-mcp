I. CAPTION
ESTEFANIA PISALBON and her husband CARLOS PAET v. ENRIQUE BALMOJA, FEDERICO LASERNA, FRANCISCA SANDOVAL, FERMIN ESQUILLO, SULPICIA SANDOVAL, CIPRIANA FLORES, MAURICIO ILASIN, G.R. No. L-17517, August 31, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In 1949, plaintiffs Pisalbon and Paet filed a complaint for partition of two parcels of land in San Manuel, Pangasinan. The Court of First Instance (CFI) dismissed it as the lands were subjects of free patent applications by the defendants. The Court of Appeals remanded the case for trial. In 1955, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint for annulment of the free patent title and Original Certificate of Title No. P-256 issued to defendant Eulalia de la Cruz (wife of defendant Balmoja).

The CFI rendered judgment on March 26, 1960, upholding the validity of the defendants' title and dismissing the complaint. Plaintiffs moved for a new trial, claiming they did not present all their evidence because they relied on the assumption that defendant Eulalia de la Cruz would not be allowed to present evidence due to a previous default order. The trial court denied the motion. Plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing error in lifting the default order and denying the new trial.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the plaintiffs are entitled to a new trial to present additional evidence.
2. W/N the plaintiffs successfully established their claim to recover the property.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The record shows that the order of default against the defendant had been lifted and her answer admitted as early as February 2, 1960, prior to the trial held on March 21, 1960. It was incumbent upon the plaintiffs to present all their evidence during the trial and "not gamble on the chance that the defendants... would not be allowed to present their own." [1]

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. The trial court found that the plaintiffs' description of the land was "nebulous" and "dark and inconclusive," lacking even specific area measurements or documents of ownership. Under **Article 434 of the Civil Code**, in an action to recover, the property must be identified, and the plaintiff must rely on the strength of his title and not on the weakness of the defendant's claim. Since plaintiffs failed to identify the land or prove their title, the complaint would have been dismissed regardless of the defendants' evidence. Conversely, the defendants proved the regularity of the issuance of their free patent title. [2, 3]

**Judgment affirmed.**
