**I. CAPTION**
FREE EMPLOYEES AND WORKERS ASSOCIATION (FEWA) v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, BETTER BUILDINGS LABOR UNION (BLU), and WILLIAM S. WARNE, G.R. No. L-20862, July 30, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Better Buildings, a cleaning maintenance proprietorship, filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) for a certification election due to conflicting representation claims by two rival unions, petitioner FEWA and respondent BLU [1]. During the hearings, BLU presented its sole witness, Nelson Padilla, who identified membership rosters (Exhibits "A", "B", and "C") [2]. FEWA subsequently moved to cross-examine Padilla, which the CIR granted. However, Padilla failed to appear at multiple scheduled hearings [3]. FEWA moved to strike Padilla's testimony, but the CIR deferred its ruling [3]. Eventually, without ruling on the motion to strike or allowing the cross-examination, Judge Martinez issued an order directing a certification election, relying on Padilla's testimony and exhibits to find a "quandary" regarding majority representation [4]. The CIR *en banc* denied FEWA's motion for reconsideration [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the CIR abused its discretion in deciding the case based on testimony and exhibits without affording the opposing party the right to cross-examine.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the CIR committed an abuse of discretion and a violation of due process [5].

While representation proceedings are generally investigative, when two rival unions claim representation, the case becomes **adversary** in nature and must be decided according to lawful evidence [6]. The requirement of an "appropriate hearing upon due notice" under Section 12(b) of the Industrial Peace Act connotes that parties must be given the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses of the adversary [6, 7].

Although the CIR is a quasi-judicial body not bound by strict rules of evidence, it cannot dispense with substantial rules essential to arriving at the truth, such as the right of confrontation and cross-examination [8]. Citing *Interstate Commerce Comm. v. Louisville & N. R. Co.*, the Court emphasized that administrative bodies cannot caprice findings by disregarding essential evidentiary practices [7, 8]. Furthermore, fairness dictates that a party moving to strike testimony must be apprised of the court's ruling before a decision on the merits is rendered [5].

Because Padilla was not cross-examined, his testimony must be discarded. Consequently, the exhibits he identified must also be rejected as they lack an independent ground for admissibility [9]. Without this evidence, the order for an election was unwarranted.

**Disposition:** The challenged orders are revoked and set aside, and the records are remanded to the CIR for a rehearing [10].
