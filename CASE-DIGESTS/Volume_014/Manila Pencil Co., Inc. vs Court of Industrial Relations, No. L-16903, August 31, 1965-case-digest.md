I. CAPTION
MANILA PENCIL COMPANY, INC. and DOMINADOR P. CANLAS v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and MAPECO LABOR UNION (PAFLU), G.R. No. L-16903, August 31, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Manila Pencil Company (the Company) and its President, Dominador Canlas, were charged with unfair labor practice (ULP) by the MAPECO Labor Union. The Union alleged that the Company dismissed several employees between October and November 1958 due to their union membership and refusal to disaffiliate [1]. The Company denied the charge, claiming the dismissals were due to severe cuts in dollar allocations for raw material importation, necessitating retrenchment, while other dismissals were for legal causes such as absenteeism [2].

The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found the Company guilty of ULP and ordered the reinstatement of five specific employees (Galang, Torres, Lingat, Yabut, and Tayag) with back wages [3]. The Company filed a petition for review, challenging the CIR's factual findings [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Company is guilty of unfair labor practice for the dismissal of the subject employees.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's decision, ruling that the findings of fact by the Industrial Court are conclusive if supported by **substantial evidence**, pursuant to Section 6 of Republic Act No. 875 and the doctrine in *Ang Tibay v. CIR* [4, 5].

Substantial evidence supported the finding of ULP. While the Company proved that its dollar allocations were reduced, this reason only justified temporary layoffs, not the *permanent* dismissal of five unionists, especially when no non-unionists were similarly dismissed [6]. The claim of retrenchment was further negated by the fact that the Company hired 15 to 20 new employees and apprentices during the same period it claimed to be suffering from a lack of raw materials [7]. Regarding the dismissal of Union President Galang for alleged absenteeism, the Company failed to present his time records, rendering the excuse unsatisfactory [7]. The dismissals were proximately caused by the employees' union activities and refusal to disaffiliate [5].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, C.J., Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Regala, Bengzon, J.P., and Zaldivar concurred [8]. Justice Barrera was on leave [8].
