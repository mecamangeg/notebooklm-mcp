I. CAPTION
**TAN SANG alias CHUA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-19914, June 23, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tan Sang, a Chinese citizen born in 1902, arrived in the Philippines in 1912 and has resided in Ozamis City since 1950. He filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental on September 24, 1960. He is married with nine children, four of whom were unmarried minors at the time of filing. He claimed exemption from filing a declaration of intention based on his continuous residence and the enrollment of his children in government-recognized schools. However, he failed to attach his Certificate of Arrival to the petition, claiming the Bureau of Immigration took it when issuing his Immigrant Certificate of Residence. His reported annual income from his business, Sin Beng Trading, was P5,000. He presented the City Treasurer and a BIR examiner as character witnesses. The trial court granted the petition. The Republic appealed, questioning the lack of the Certificate of Arrival, the sufficiency of his income, and the credibility of his witnesses.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to attach the Certificate of Arrival to the petition is a fatal defect.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade, profession, or occupation.
3. W/N the character witnesses presented are qualified to vouch for the petitioner.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law expressly requires the inclusion of the Certificate of Arrival as part of the petition. This requirement is mandatory, and failure to comply is a fatal defect (*Charm Chan vs. Republic*). The petitioner's excuse that the Bureau of Immigration retained the original is not valid; he should have secured a certified copy of the certificate and submitted it as required by law [1].

2. **NO.** An annual average income of P5,000 is not considered lucrative for an applicant with a wife and nine children, four of whom are unmarried minors. The Court relied on precedents like *Koa Gui vs. Republic* and *Tan vs. Republic*, where higher incomes for applicants with fewer dependents were deemed insufficient to meet the economic requirement of the Naturalization Law [2].

3. **NO.** Character witnesses must have intimate knowledge of the applicant to competently vouch for his good moral character. The witnesses presented (a City Treasurer and a BIR examiner) admitted their relationship with the petitioner was merely on a professional or business level. Business dealings alone do not provide a sufficient basis for the "intimate knowledge" required by law (*Uy vs. Republic*) [3].

**WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby REVERSED and the petition for naturalization is DENIED.**
