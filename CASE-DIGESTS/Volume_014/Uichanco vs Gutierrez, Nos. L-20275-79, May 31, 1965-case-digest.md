I. CAPTION
VIRGINIA B. UICHANCO, EDUARDO LIM and MERCEDES B. UICHANCO v. FIDEL GUTIERREZ, MARCOS DE LA PEÑA, GERARDO PECHO, REYNALDO MERCADO and FLAVIANO EVANGELISTA, G.R. Nos. L-20275-79, May 31, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondents were share tenants of petitioners on rice farms in Calamba, Laguna, under a verbal tenancy agreement established around 1956 [1, 2]. Under this arrangement, they divided the harvest on a 50-50 basis, with tenants shouldering production expenses [1]. In 1960, pursuant to Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199 (Agricultural Tenancy Act), as amended, the respondents demanded the conversion of their relationship from share tenancy to leasehold tenancy [1]. Petitioners opposed this demand, arguing that the law was unconstitutional as it impaired their freedom of contract and property rights [3]. The Court of Agrarian Relations ruled in favor of the tenants, upholding their right to change the tenancy system [3]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199, which grants tenants the right to change the tenancy contract from share to leasehold, is constitutional [4].

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations and upheld the constitutionality of Section 14 of R.A. No. 1199 [5, 6]. The Court relied on its previous rulings in *Rams v. Court of Agrarian Relations* and *Macasaet v. Court of Agrarian Relations*, which validated the statute [5]. Furthermore, since the parties entered into the verbal tenancy relationship in 1956 when the law already existed, the tenant's statutory right to demand a leasehold arrangement was deemed included in their contract [2]. Consequently, the petitioners cannot claim that the law interfered with or impaired their contractual rights [2].

The decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations is affirmed [6, 7].
