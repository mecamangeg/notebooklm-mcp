I. CAPTION
ROQUE ESCAÑO v. RODRIGO C. LIM, G.R. No. L-20737, May 31, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Roque Escaño applied with the Public Service Commission (PSC) for authority to operate ten taxicab units in Cagayan de Oro City, which was granted in 1959 despite the opposition of respondent Rodrigo C. Lim. Lim moved for reconsideration, arguing Escaño was unqualified due to pending charges for violating separate certificates for TPU and AC services (specifically, allowing third persons to operate under said franchises). In March 1960, the PSC found Escaño guilty in the TPU and AC cases and cancelled those certificates; however, Escaño filed a motion for reconsideration which remained pending. Relying on this conviction, the PSC subsequently revoked Escaño's taxicab authority in July 1962. Escaño appealed, arguing the revocation was improper as the conviction was not final and involved a distinct service.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission may revoke a taxicab certificate based on a non-final conviction for the violation of totally distinct certificates (TPU and AC services).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the PSC's orders. The Court held that the PSC may not penalize an operator with the revocation of his taxicab permit based on a non-final conviction of an alleged violation of another and distinct certificate. The conviction regarding the TPU and AC services was still subject to a pending motion for reconsideration and was therefore not final. Furthermore, the Court ruled that while a violation of the conditions of a certificate entitles the Commission to revoke the *violated* certificate, it has never been held that such violation alone results in the forfeiture of a *totally different* certificate, especially given that the nature of taxicab service is different from TPU and AC services. The orders revoking the petitioner's taxicab certificate were reversed and set aside.
