I. CAPTION
CATALINA VDA. DE VISMANOS, ET AL. v. MUNICIPALITY OF TAGUM, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20685, August 31, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners are the widow and heirs of Clemente Vismanos, a homestead applicant for a tract of land in Tagum, Davao [1], [2]. On June 18, 1948, prior to the issuance of the patent, petitioners executed a "Quitclaim Deed" relinquishing their rights over a one-hectare portion of the land to respondent Municipality of Tagum for P200.00 [1], [3]. The Municipality immediately took possession and utilized the lot as a market site [4]. On August 29, 1949, a homestead patent and Original Certificate of Title were issued in the name of the heirs covering the entire homestead applied for [5]. Subsequently, the title to the specific portion in question was transferred to petitioner Catalina Vda. de Vismanos [6], [7]. In 1961, petitioners filed a complaint for recovery of possession and quieting of title, arguing the quitclaim was void as it violated the Public Land Act prohibition against alienation before patent issuance [1]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, ruling the transfer valid [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the quitclaim deed executed in favor of the Municipality prior to the issuance of the homestead patent is valid.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. While Section 118 of the Public Land Act (Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended) generally prohibits the alienation or encumbrance of homestead lands from the date of application until five years after the patent issuance, it explicitly provides an exception for transfers "in favor of the Government or any of its branches, units or institutions" [9]. The Municipality of Tagum clearly falls within this exception; hence, the 1948 quitclaim deed is not null and void [10].

Additionally, although the patent issued in 1949 covered the entire homestead, it did not nullify the earlier quitclaim [11]. Under Article 1434 of the Civil Code, when a person sells or alienates a thing they do not own, and subsequently acquires title thereto, such title passes by operation of law to the grantee [12]. Thus, the subsequent issuance of the patent to the petitioners cured any defect in the Municipality's title [12]. The Court also noted that petitioners were barred by laches for delaying the suit for over 12 years while the Municipality openly possessed the land [13]. The appealed decision is affirmed [14].
