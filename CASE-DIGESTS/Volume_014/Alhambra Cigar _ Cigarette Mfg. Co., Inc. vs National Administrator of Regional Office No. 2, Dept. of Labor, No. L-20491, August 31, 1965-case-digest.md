I. CAPTION
ALHAMBRA CIGAR AND CIGARETTE MANUFACTURING COMPANY, INC. v. THE NATIONAL ADMINISTRATOR OF REGIONAL OFFICE NO. 2, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, et al., G.R. No. L-20491, August 31, 1965, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Francisco Atip, a former driver for petitioner Alhambra Cigar & Cigarette Mfg. Co., filed a claim for compensation (Workmen’s Compensation) at Regional Office No. 2 of the Department of Labor located in Tuguegarao, Cagayan. Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the claim was barred by prescription. The Hearing Officer, respondent Eugenio Caleda, denied the motion. Instead of appealing the order, petitioner filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary injunction before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to restrain the labor officials in Cagayan from hearing the case. The CFI of Manila granted the petition and permanently enjoined the respondents in Cagayan from proceeding with the claim.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CFI of Manila has jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari, prohibition, and injunction against government officials located in Cagayan.
2. W/N the petition for certiorari and prohibition was the proper remedy to challenge the Hearing Officer's denial of the motion to dismiss.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance to issue writs of injunction is limited to acts committed or about to be committed within the territorial boundaries of their respective provinces and districts [1, 2]. Under Section 44(h) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 and Section 4, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, the power to issue these writs is co-extensive with the court's territorial jurisdiction [1, 3]. Since the respondents were officials of Regional Office No. 2 in Tuguegarao, Cagayan, and the acts sought to be restrained were to be performed there, the CFI of Manila had no authority to issue the writs [4]. The petition should have been filed in the CFI of Cagayan [5].

2. **NO.** The Regional Office of the Department of Labor has original and exclusive jurisdiction over Workmen's Compensation cases under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A [6]. The determination of whether a claim is barred by the statute of limitations is a matter for the Hearing Officer to decide within that jurisdiction [7]. If the Hearing Officer erred in finding the claim was filed on time, it constituted a mere error of judgment correctable by appeal to the Workmen's Compensation Commission, not an error of jurisdiction remediable by certiorari or prohibition [7].

**Decision reversed.** The writs issued by the lower court are declared null and void [8].
