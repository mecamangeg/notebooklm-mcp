I. CAPTION
ANTONIO J. VILLEGAS, in his official capacity as Mayor of the City of Manila v. ABELARDO SUBIDO, in his official capacity as Commissioner of Civil Service, et al., G.R. Nos. L-24012 & L-24040, August 9, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
In January 1965, respondent Commissioner of Civil Service Abelardo Subido issued Memorandum Circulars Nos. 1 and 3 [1, 2]. Circular No. 1 declared that Republic Act (R.A.) No. 2260 (Civil Service Act of 1959) impliedly repealed R.A. No. 557, ordering city and municipal councils to cease investigating administrative charges against policemen and to submit pending cases to the Commissioner [1]. Circular No. 3 declared that R.A. No. 2260 impliedly repealed Section 22 of R.A. No. 409 (Revised Charter of Manila), ordering the Manila Mayor to cease deciding administrative cases of competitive city employees [2].

Manila Mayor Antonio Villegas filed two petitions for prohibition and injunction, as the Vice-Mayor intended to comply with these circulars, which would divest the Mayor and the Municipal Board of their disciplinary powers [3]. The Supreme Court issued a preliminary injunction [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N R.A. No. 2260 impliedly repealed R.A. No. 557 and Section 22 of R.A. No. 409, thereby vesting exclusive disciplinary jurisdiction in the Commissioner of Civil Service [4].

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that R.A. No. 557 and R.A. No. 409 constitute special laws covering specific situations of policemen and Manila city employees, which subsist side-by-side with R.A. No. 2260, a general law [5]. Repeals by implication are not favored, and where laws can be reasonably reconciled, construction will be against such repeal [6].

Section 16(i) of R.A. No. 2260 grants the Commissioner "final authority to pass upon" removals and suspensions [7]. The Court ruled that this power "presupposes," rather than "negates," the power vested in another official to originally or initially decide the removal or suspension [8]. Furthermore, Section 16(i) contains the saving clause "Except as otherwise provided by law," which preserves the power of the City Council and City Mayor granted by special laws [5, 9].

The effect of R.A. No. 2260 on Section 22 of R.A. No. 409 is limited to the appellate level: appeals from decisions of the City Mayor are now brought to the Commissioner of Civil Service instead of the Office of the President [10].

Petitions granted; preliminary injunction made permanent [11].
