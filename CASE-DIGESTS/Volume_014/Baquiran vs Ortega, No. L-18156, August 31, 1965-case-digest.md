I. CAPTION
MAXIMO BAQUIRAN v. HON. WENCESLAO ORTEGA of the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte, ANTONINO BAQUIRAN, ET AL., and the PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, Ilocos Norte Branch, G.R. No. L-18156, August 31, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
In a previous civil case (Case No. 591), the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Ilocos Norte ordered the partition of six parcels of land and granted the plaintiffs, Antonino and Damaso Baquiran, the option to acquire the house of defendant Maximo Baquiran built on the lots by paying him P5,000.00 [1]. This decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals [2]. Antonino and Damaso exercised this option, deposited the P5,000.00 with the Clerk of Court, and took possession of the house [3].

Subsequently, Maximo filed a motion to withdraw the deposit, but it was opposed by the Philippine National Bank (PNB) and Spouses Andres [4]. PNB claimed entitlement to the house—and thus the proceeds—having foreclosed a mortgage on the property and consolidated title after Maximo failed to redeem it [4, 5]. Fearing disturbance in their possession due to these adverse claims, Antonino and Damaso moved for the return of their P5,000.00 deposit [5]. The CFI granted their motion and ordered the return of the deposit to them [6]. Maximo Baquiran filed a petition for certiorari to review this order [1, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs (Antonino and Damaso) are entitled to the return of the P5,000.00 deposit after exercising their option to acquire the house.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that in the absence of any cogent and valid excuse, an option exercised to its completion should be irrevocable [7]. Antonino and Damaso had already performed all acts necessary to consummate their right by depositing the payment and taking possession of the house; thus, they cannot revoke their decision [7]. Their apprehension regarding the adverse claims was unfounded because the creditors were not claiming the house itself, but rather the proceeds (the P5,000.00) from its sale [8].

Since ownership of the house had passed from Maximo to PNB via foreclosure and consolidation of title before the judgment could be executed, PNB was subrogated to Maximo's right to receive the P5,000.00 [9]. Furthermore, Maximo and the other claimants stipulated and agreed that PNB should withdraw the amount [10].

**The orders of the lower court were modified, and the Court directed the withdrawal of the P5,000.00 deposit in favor of the Philippine National Bank [11].**
