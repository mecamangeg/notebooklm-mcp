**I. CAPTION**
MANILA SURETY AND FIDELITY CO., INC. v. BATH CONSTRUCTION AND COMPANY, CARLOS N. BAQUIRAN, GONZALO AMBOY, and ANDRES TUNAC, G.R. No. L-16636, June 24, 1965, Makalintal, J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
On April 27, 1959, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a decision in favor of the plaintiff, Manila Surety & Fidelity Co., Inc. [2]. The defendants, Bath Construction and Company et al., received a copy of the decision on May 2, 1959 [2]. On May 12, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration, but the motion lacked a notice of the time and place of hearing [2]. Consequently, on May 21, the lower court issued an order declaring that the filing could not be considered a motion as it presented no question the court could decide [2].

On May 30, the defendants filed a "supplement" to their motion which included the requisite notice of hearing [3]. The court denied both the motion and the supplement on June 6, 1959 [3]. Following the defendants' filing of a notice of appeal on June 18, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was filed out of time, arguing that the defective May 12 motion was *pro forma* and did not interrupt the appeal period [3]. The trial court sustained the dismissal, ruling the appeal period had expired on June 15 [3]. The defendants filed a petition for relief based on excusable negligence, which was dismissed, leading to this appeal to the Supreme Court [3, 4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a motion for reconsideration lacking a notice of time and place of hearing interrupts the period for appeal. [4]

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal, ruling that a motion for reconsideration without the requisite notice of hearing does not toll the period for appeal [5, 6].

The Court reasoned that Section 2 of Rule 37 regarding motions for new trial (applicable to motions for reconsideration) requires written notice be served on the adverse party [4]. This refers to the notice prescribed for motions in general under Rule 15, Sections 4 and 5, which mandates that such notice state the time and place of hearing and be served at least three days in advance [5]. Under Section 6 of Rule 15, no motion shall be acted upon without proof of such notice [5].

Citing *Philippine National Bank v. Donasco*, the Court held that a motion lacking this requirement is nothing but a "useless piece of paper" [5]. Without a set time and place for hearing, the court cannot determine if the motion is contentious, and thus it presents no question for the court to decide [5]. Since the May 12 motion was defective, it did not interrupt the running of the appeal period, which expired before the appeal was perfected [6].

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED**. [6]

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Bengzon, C.J., Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, Dizon, Regala, Bengzon, J.P., and Zaldivar, JJ., concurred. [6]
