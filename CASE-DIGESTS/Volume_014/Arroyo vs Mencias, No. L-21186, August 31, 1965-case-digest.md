I. CAPTION
ZOSIMO ARROYO v. HON. EULOGIO MENCIAS, ERNESTO T. SANTOS and RAMONA SANTOS-ROXAS, G.R. No. L-21186, August 31, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Ernesto Santos and Ramona Santos-Roxas filed a complaint for accounting and partition (Civil Case No. 6557) against their co-owners in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal [1]. On January 9, 1963, respondent Judge Mencias issued an order commanding the lessees of the co-owned properties, including petitioner Zosimo Arroyo, to deposit their rentals with the Clerk of Court [2]. Arroyo, a lessee and not a party to the partition case, filed a petition for certiorari directly with the Supreme Court to annul the order, arguing the trial court lacked jurisdiction over his person and the order was impractical [3]. Notably, Arroyo did not file a motion for reconsideration with the CFI before seeking relief from the Supreme Court, although the defendants in the civil case had filed one which was denied [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for certiorari is proper despite the petitioner's failure to file a motion for reconsideration with the trial court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the petition. Under Rule 67 of the Old Rules of Court, certiorari will lie only when there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law [5]. The petitioner's adequate remedy was to make a special appearance in the trial court and move for the reconsideration of the order [6]. This requirement ensures the lower court is given the opportunity to correct any errors before the matter is elevated to the Supreme Court [6]. The Court held that the omission of this step is fatal, and the motion for reconsideration filed by the intervenors (defendants) could not take the place of the motion that ought to have been filed by the petitioner himself [4].

Accordingly, the petition for a writ of certiorari was **DENIED** and the preliminary injunction dissolved [4].
