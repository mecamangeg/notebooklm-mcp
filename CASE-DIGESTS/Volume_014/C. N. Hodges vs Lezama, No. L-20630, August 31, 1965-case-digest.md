I. CAPTION
C. N. HODGES and RICARDO GURREA v. JOSE MANUEL LEZAMA, PAQUITA B. LEZAMA, BENJAMIN LUIS BORJA and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-20630, August 31, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner C. N. Hodges sold 2,230 shares of stock (Stock Certificate No. 17) of La Paz Ice Plant & Cold Storage Co., Inc. to respondent Benjamin Borja on November 1, 1954 [1, 2]. To secure payment, Borja executed a chattel mortgage on the shares in favor of Hodges, but Hodges retained possession of Certificate No. 17, which remained unendorsed and uncancelled [1, 3].

When Borja failed to pay, Hodges foreclosed the mortgage and reacquired the shares at a public auction on September 17, 1958 [1, 4]. However, respondents Jose and Paquita Lezama (corporate officers) issued Stock Certificate No. 18 to Borja and allowed him to vote in a stockholders' meeting [5, 6]. Hodges filed for prohibition with preliminary injunction. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo ruled for Hodges, declaring Certificate No. 18 void [5, 6]. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Borja became the owner upon the initial sale and that Hodges should have filed a separate action for mandamus [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Hodges is the rightful owner of the shares entitled to the issuance of a new stock certificate.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that even if title had initially passed to Borja upon the sale and execution of the chattel mortgage, such title reverted to Hodges when he reacquired the shares at the public auction during the foreclosure proceedings [3, 4]. Furthermore, the retention of the certificate by Hodges implied an agreement that he would remain the owner for all intents and purposes until full payment [7]. The Court emphasized that since all parties and facts were before the tribunal, it would sacrifice justice to form to dismiss the case and require a separate action for the cancellation of Borja's certificate [4].

The Court reversed the Court of Appeals decision and ordered Borja to surrender Stock Certificate No. 18 for cancellation, directing the issuance of a new certificate in favor of Hodges [8].
