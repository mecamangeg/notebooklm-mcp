I. CAPTION
SOLIS & YARISANTOS v. LIBERATOR SALVADOR and CESARIA M. SALVADOR, G.R. No. L-17022, August 14, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner, a construction partnership, contracted with Respondents in 1952 to plan and supervise the construction of a house for a service fee of 10% of the estimated cost (P16,230.00) [1]. After completion in December 1952, Petitioner claimed additional payments for "extras," including a terrace, a fence, and an increase in floor area [2]. The Court of Appeals (CA) found that while there were extras (terrace and lights), the Respondents had already overpaid P897.00 beyond the contract price, which sufficiently covered these extras on a *quantum meruit* basis [3]. The CA rejected other claims due to vague specifications or lack of evidence [4, 5]. Additionally, Respondents paid P2,000.00 in January 1954 to settle the case, which the CA ordered Petitioner to return because Petitioner failed to withdraw the complaint as agreed [6]. The CA also awarded moral damages to Respondents for the anxiety of litigation [7]. Petitioner appealed, claiming service fees on the extras and challenging the moral damages [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Petitioner is entitled to the 10% service fee on the cost of the extras (terrace and lights).
2. W/N the award of moral damages to Respondents is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that since the appellate court explicitly found that Petitioner incurred extra expenses for the terrace and additional lights (valued at P897.00), Petitioner is entitled to the 10% service fee stipulated in Article II of the contract [9]. Petitioner is credited P89.70 [9].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled there was no clear showing of malice by the Petitioner in filing the action [7]. Although the facts favored the Respondents, Petitioner's evidence was not utterly unworthy of credence [7]. The Court applied the doctrine that the worries and mental anxiety usually suffered by a party haled into court as a defendant are not sufficient justification for awarding moral damages absent proof of malice [7, 10].

The judgment is **MODIFIED**. The award of moral damages is eliminated. Petitioner is credited P89.70, to be deducted from the P2,000.00 it must return to Respondents [11].
