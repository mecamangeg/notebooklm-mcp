I. CAPTION
In the Matter of the Petition for Philippine Citizenship, Go Kem Lim alias William Go v. Republic of the Philippines, G.R. No. L-20227, May 31, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Go Kem Lim, born in the Philippines of Chinese parents, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental [1]. He presented two character witnesses, the Mayor and Municipal Secretary of Baliangao, who attested to his good conduct and residence in said municipality [2, 3]. Petitioner testified that he believed in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution and had mingled socially with Filipinos, citing his appointment as treasurer of a local Jose Rizal Centenary Celebration [4]. The lower court granted the petition [5]. The Republic appealed, arguing that the petitioner failed to prove his belief in constitutional principles and that his evidence regarding social mingling and proper conduct was insufficient [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has proven his belief in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution.
2. W/N the petitioner satisfied the requirement of social mingling with Filipinos.
3. W/N the character witnesses were competent to attest to the petitioner’s good conduct.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner failed to prove his belief in the principles underlying the Constitution because, despite his claims, he could not mention a single one of said principles [7, 8]. While he argued that his actions—such as supporting his family or participating in civic projects—demonstrated this belief, the Court ruled that for actions to indicate belief in constitutional principles, they must be "conclusively attributable to said principles as to convince the Court that they spring from a belief in them" [7, 9].

2. **NO.** The petitioner failed to show sincere social mingling, which requires dealing with Filipinos in a spirit of friendliness and equality without discrimination [10]. The Court noted that the petitioner finished high school in a Chinese school where Filipinos were not allowed to enroll [11, 12]. Furthermore, when asked to mention a Filipino custom, his only reply was, "We eat three times a day," showing a lack of sincere desire to embrace Filipino customs and ideals [11, 12].

3. **NO.** The character witnesses were residents of Baliangao, but the petitioner spent a significant portion of his time studying in Cebu [13]. Consequently, the witnesses could not qualify to attest to the petitioner's good conduct and irreproachable character during the "entire period of his residence in the Philippines" as required by law [13, 14].

**Decision reversed; petition denied.** [12, 15]
