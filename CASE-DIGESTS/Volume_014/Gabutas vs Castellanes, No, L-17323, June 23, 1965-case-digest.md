I. CAPTION
CLAUDIO GABUTAS v. GUIDO D. CASTELLANES, in his capacity as Municipal Mayor of Calatrava, Negros Occidental, G.R. No. L-17323, June 23, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Claudio Gabutas was appointed as a temporary member of the Municipal Police Force of Calatrava, Negros Occidental on May 2, 1951 [1]. On May 10, 1955, he was suspended from service due to the filing of two criminal cases against him [1]. While the cases were pending, Respondent Mayor Castellanes notified Gabutas of his separation from service effective September 15, 1957 [1]. On September 27, 1957, Gabutas was acquitted in the criminal cases [1].

Gabutas sought reinstatement and payment of back salaries, but the Mayor refused [1]. Gabutas filed a petition for Mandamus [1]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the petition [2]. On appeal, Gabutas abandoned his claim for reinstatement and solely sought the recovery of back salaries covering the period of his suspension (May 10, 1955) up to his separation from service (September 15, 1957) pursuant to Section 4 of Republic Act No. 557 [3], [4]. The Respondent argued that the law does not apply to temporary appointees without civil service eligibility and that the claim for salary is merely incidental to reinstatement [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a police officer with a temporary appointment and no civil service eligibility is entitled to back salaries upon acquittal under R.A. No. 557.
2. W/N the right to back salaries is barred if the officer no longer seeks reinstatement.
3. W/N Mandamus is the proper remedy.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 4 of Republic Act No. 557 provides that a member of the police force accused of a felony shall be suspended and, "in case of acquittal, the accused shall be entitled to payment of the entire salary he failed to receive during his suspension" [3]. The Court ruled that this provision does not require civil service eligibility or permanent appointment as a condition for entitlement [6]. The Court declined to read into the law a condition that the lawmaker did not include [6].

2. **NO.** The fact that the Petitioner no longer seeks reinstatement is no justification to deny him payment of the salary he failed to receive during suspension [4]. The only condition imposed by law is acquittal, which was fulfilled [4]. However, the payment is limited to the period from his suspension until the date of his separation from service (September 15, 1957), as his temporary appointment was terminable at the pleasure of the appointing authority [4].

3. **YES.** Mandamus is the proper remedy because the law gives the Petitioner a clear legal right to back salaries upon acquittal, creating an imperative legal duty for the authorities to pay [7]. Although the suit was against the Mayor, he was sued in his official capacity; thus, the Municipality of Calatrava, as the real party in duty bound to pay, had its day in court and is bound by the decision [7].

The decision of the lower court is REVERSED [8].
