I. CAPTION
FE RECIDO, PETRA RECIDO and SIMON MERCADO v. ALFONSO T. REFASO, GERONIMA MANLUGON and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-16641, June 24, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Jose Recido’s homestead application was approved in 1929, and the order for the issuance of the patent was promulgated on March 27, 1941. However, the patent and certificate of title were physically issued only in 1949, after Jose’s death. His daughters and heirs, Petra and Fe Recido, inherited the property. On June 14, 1948, Petra sold her undivided share to respondents spouses Refaso. On January 26, 1949, Fe sold her share to petitioner Simon Mercado, who later sold it to the Refasos. In 1955, the sisters executed an extrajudicial partition where Petra renounced her rights to Fe, resulting in a TCT issued in Fe’s name.

The Refasos sued to assert ownership. Petitioners contended the sales were void for violating the prohibition against alienation within five years from patent issuance, arguing the period should be counted from the 1949 physical issuance. Fe further claimed her sale to Mercado was void because she was a minor at the time. The trial court validated Petra’s sale but annulled Fe’s. The Court of Appeals reversed, declaring both sales valid and awarding the entire property to the Refasos.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the sales violated the 5-year prohibition against alienation of homesteads.
2. W/N the sale by Fe Recido was void due to her minority.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that for the purpose of the five-year prohibition against alienation, the patent is deemed issued upon the promulgation of the order for issuance by the Director of Lands, rather than the actual physical issuance of the patent. The order was issued on March 27, 1941, so the prohibition expired in 1946. Therefore, Petra’s sale in 1948 and Fe’s sale in 1949 were executed outside the prohibited period and are valid. The Court applied the doctrine established in *Tinio v. Frances* and *Balboa v. Farrales*.

2. **NO.** The Court held that the contract was merely voidable, not void. Fe was an emancipated minor by marriage, and under Article 1390 of the New Civil Code, such contracts are binding unless annulled by a proper court action. Fe failed to file a cross-claim or separate action to annul the contract. Furthermore, having alleged that she lacked parental consent, she bore the burden of proving that negative allegation, which she failed to discharge. The respondents sufficiently met their burden by proving the execution of the sale documents.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.
