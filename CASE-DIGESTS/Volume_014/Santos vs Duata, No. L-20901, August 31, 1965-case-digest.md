I. CAPTION
CIRIACA SANTOS v. TEODORICA DUATA and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-20901, August 31, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Pedro Duata and Epifania Aguilar held rights to a parcel of land (one-fourth of Lot No. 37) in Bulacan since 1908 [1]. In 1933, Lot No. 37 was purchased from the Bureau of Lands by Ciriaca Santos, Petrona Gaanan, and Epifania Aguilar, but the title was issued solely in Ciriaca Santos' name for convenience [2]. On September 25, 1938, Epifania executed a document (Exhibit 3) purportedly selling her one-fourth interest to Ciriaca for P154.00, subject to repurchase within one year [3]. Despite this execution, Epifania remained in possession of the land and continued paying the land taxes [4].

In 1955, Teodorica Duata (Epifania’s daughter) filed an action for reconveyance against Ciriaca [3]. The Trial Court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the transaction was a sale with *pacto de retro* and ownership had vested in Ciriaca upon failure to redeem [5]. The Court of Appeals reversed this decision, declaring the transaction an *equitable mortgage* and ordering reconveyance upon payment of the loan [6]. Ciriaca appealed to the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the contract between the parties is an equitable mortgage.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals, holding that the contract is an equitable mortgage. While the stipulation in the document indicated a transfer by way of sale with *pacto de retro*, the acts of the parties showed otherwise [4]. Specifically, the vendor (Epifania) remained in possession of the land and continued to pay the real estate taxes [4].

Under Article 1602 of the New Civil Code, a contract is presumed to be an equitable mortgage in cases where the vendor remains in possession or binds himself to pay the taxes on the thing sold [8, 9]. The Court rejected the petitioner’s contention that an "overwhelming number of circumstances" must concur; the law expressly states that the presence of *any* of the enumerated circumstances is sufficient to raise the presumption [10]. Furthermore, Article 1602 is remedial in nature and applies retroactively to cases arising prior to the effectivity of the New Civil Code [11].

The petition is DENIED and the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [12].
