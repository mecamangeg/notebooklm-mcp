I. CAPTION
INDIAN COMMERCIAL CO. v. CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19157, June 30, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Indian Commercial Co. (petitioner) sought a refund of P27,013.04 paid to the Central Bank’s agent, Bank of America, as a 17% specific tax on foreign exchange remittances for imported goods. The letters of credit were opened between June and November 1955, while Republic Act No. 601 (imposing the tax) was in force. However, the petitioner argued that the tax should be refunded because they paid the amount to the Central Bank's agent in Manila between January 9 and 23, 1956, after the law abolishing the tax had supposedly taken effect. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling against the refund. [1, 2]

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the imposition of the 17% foreign exchange tax is determined by the date of payment to the creditor abroad rather than the date of payment to the agent bank in the Philippines. [3]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. Relying on the doctrine in *Belman Compania, Inc. v. Central Bank* and *Marsman Company, Inc. v. Central Bank*, the Court held that an irrevocable letter of credit is a consummated contract only when the agent bank pays or delivers the foreign currency to the creditor abroad. Therefore, the determinative factor for the 17% excise tax is the date of payment or delivery of the foreign currency to the creditor abroad, not the date the debtor pays the bank in the Philippines. Since the drafts were accepted and the foreign exchange sold/consummated during the effectivity of R.A. No. 601, the tax was correctly imposed regardless of when the petitioner reimbursed the agent bank in Manila. [3-7]

The decision of the Court of First Instance is AFFIRMED. [7, 8]
