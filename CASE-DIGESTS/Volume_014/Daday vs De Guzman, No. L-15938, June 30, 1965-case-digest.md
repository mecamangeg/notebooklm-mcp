I. CAPTION
CARMELINO DADAY, MACARIO VICENTE, WILSON LIJAYAN, ET AL. v. HON. PASTOR L. DE GUZMAN and SATURNINA PABILIAN, G.R. No. L-15938, June 30, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Saturnina Pabilian instituted a tenancy litigation against petitioners Carmelino Daday, et al. in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) presided by Judge De Guzman. The CAR rendered a decision, a copy of which was received by the petitioners' counsel on May 28, 1959, as evidenced by the court records [1, 2]. Petitioners filed a motion to set aside the decision on June 11, 1959. After the motion was denied, petitioners received notice of the denial on September 2, 1959, and subsequently filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court on September 4, 1959 [3]. Respondents challenged the petition for being filed beyond the reglementary period, noting that 16 days had elapsed [2, 3]. Petitioners countered that they received the decision on May 29, not May 28, which would have made their filing timely [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for review was filed within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petition was filed one day late. The Court relied on the CAR records showing petitioners' counsel signed for the receipt of the decision on May 28, 1959, contradicting their claim of May 29 [2, 4]. The computation revealed that 14 days elapsed between the receipt of the decision (May 28) and the filing of the motion to set aside (June 11), and another 2 days elapsed between the notice of denial (September 2) and the filing of the petition (September 4), totaling 16 days [2]. Under Section 13 of Republic Act No. 1267, as amended, the period to file a petition for review is fixed at 15 days [3]. The Court emphasized that September 3, 1959—the actual deadline—was a Thursday and not a legal holiday [2]. Failure to file a petition for review within the time prescribed by law is fatal to the appeal [4].

The petition was dismissed with costs against petitioners [4].
