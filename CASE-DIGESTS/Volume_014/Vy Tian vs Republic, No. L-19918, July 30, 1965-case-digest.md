I. CAPTION
VY TIAN alias SI UN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19918, July 30, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Vy Tian, a Chinese citizen who arrived in the Philippines in 1936, filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Cebu. He has resided in the country for 25 years. He is married with eight children, five of whom are attending school. He is the sole owner of a business with a capital of P50,000.00, from which he derives an annual income of P6,000.00 to P7,000.00. He used the alias "Si Un" without court authority. In support of his petition, he presented witnesses who had known him for only about ten years. The trial court granted the petition, prompting the Republic to appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the petitioner's use of an alias was proper.
3. W/N the character witnesses were qualified to testify on his conduct.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** An annual income of P6,000.00 to P7,000.00 is not considered a lucrative occupation for an applicant with a wife and eight children to support, five of whom are in school. Citing *Keng Giok v. Republic*, the Court held that such income is insufficient considering the high cost of living and the low purchasing power of the peso [1].

2. **NO.** The petitioner's use of the alias "Si Un" without prior permission from the court is contrary to Commonwealth Act 142 (The Anti-Alias Law) [2].

3. **NO.** The witnesses knew the petitioner for only about ten years, whereas he had resided in the Philippines for twenty-five years. The law requires the applicant to establish proper and irreproachable conduct during the *entire* period of his residence in the Philippines [2, 3].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DISMISSED**.
