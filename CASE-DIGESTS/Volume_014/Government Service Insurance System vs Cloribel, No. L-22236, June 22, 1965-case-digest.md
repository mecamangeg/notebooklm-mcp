I. CAPTION
**GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM v. HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL and RAILROAD UNPAID RETIREES UNION, INC.**, G.R. No. L-22236, June 22, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
The Railroad Unpaid Retirees Union, Inc. (RURU) filed a petition for mandamus against the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) and Manila Railroad Company regarding retirement premiums and benefits. A compromise agreement was approved by the Court of Appeals in 1961. In 1963, RURU filed for execution of judgment in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, presided by Judge Cloribel, to claim benefit differentials [1], [2], [3].

Judge Cloribel granted the execution on July 10, 1963. GSIS received the order on July 16 and filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) on July 19. The MR was denied, and GSIS received the denial on August 15. On August 27, GSIS filed a Notice of Appeal and appeal bond to elevate the case to the Supreme Court [3], [4]. Judge Cloribel dismissed the appeal on the grounds that: (1) it was filed beyond the reglementary period; (2) the notice failed to state the appeal was based purely on questions of law; and (3) no record on appeal was filed [5]. GSIS filed the instant petition for certiorari and mandamus [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appeal was perfected within the reglementary period.
2. W/N the Notice of Appeal was defective for failing to state it was based purely on questions of law.
3. W/N the lower court had the authority to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was for delay or not purely on questions of law.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The appeal was filed on time. Since the appeal was an incident of a mandamus case, the reglementary period is 15 days from notice under Sec. 17, Rule 41 (Old Rules of Court) [7]. GSIS consumed 3 days before filing its MR (July 16 to 19) and 12 days after receiving the denial (August 15 to 27), totaling exactly 15 days [7]. The MR suspended the period because it specifically referenced documentary evidence (the compromise agreement) to show findings were not supported by evidence [8]. Furthermore, a record on appeal is not required in mandamus appeals as the original record is transmitted [7].

2. **NO.** Where the notice of appeal states it is being taken to the Supreme Court, there is no need to explicitly state it is based purely on questions of law [8]. By appealing directly to the Supreme Court, the appellant is deemed to have waived the right to dispute findings of fact [8].

3. **NO.** The right to pass upon whether an appeal is manifestly for delay resides in the appellate court during the consideration of the appeal, not in the court *a quo* [9]. The lower court erroneously dismissed the timely appeal.

**Petition granted.** The writ of mandamus is issued, and the preliminary injunction is made permanent.
