I. CAPTION
MALAYANG MANGGAGAWA SA ESSO (PFPW) and PHILIPPINE FEDERATION OF PETROLEUM WORKERS v. ESSO STANDARD EASTERN, INC. and HON. CARMELINO G. ALVENDIA, G.R. No. L-24224, July 30, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Esso Standard Eastern, Inc. (ESSO) had an existing collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the Citizens Labor Union (CLU). On January 7, 1965, petitioner Malayang Manggagawa sa Esso (MME) filed a petition for certification election with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), claiming to represent the majority of ESSO's employees. ESSO intervened in the CIR case to move for dismissal, citing its existing CBA with CLU. On February 19, 1965, amidst the pending proceedings, MME declared a strike at ESSO's Pandacan Terminal, allegedly due to unfair labor practices.

ESSO subsequently filed a petition for injunction with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, claiming MME’s activities were illegal given the existing CBA and pending election. The CFI issued a writ of preliminary injunction *ex parte* against the strike and picketing. MME filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, arguing the CFI lacked jurisdiction.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance (CFI) has jurisdiction to issue an injunction against a strike resulting from a certification election controversy pending before the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the controversy constitutes a "labor dispute" within the meaning of the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. 875), specifically Section 2(j), as it concerns the representation of persons in negotiating terms of employment. Although the rivalry was primarily between two unions, ESSO became a disputant when it intervened in the CIR certification case. The strike was an incident interwoven with the bargaining supremacy contest already pending in the CIR. Therefore, the remedy and jurisdiction lay exclusively with the CIR, not the regular courts.

Furthermore, the CFI failed to comply with the strict procedural requisites of Section 9(d) of R.A. 875 for issuing injunctions in labor disputes (e.g., hearing testimony, finding of substantial and irreparable injury). The Court distinguished this case from *Associated Labor Union v. Ramolete*, noting that ESSO did not claim damages or allege specific illegal acts of violence, but sought a blanket injunction against the right to strike itself. The petition was granted, the CFI order set aside, and the injunction against the CFI's order made permanent.
