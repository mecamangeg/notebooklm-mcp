I. CAPTION
VICENTE DE LARA, JR., ET AL. v. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21653, May 31, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Vicente de Lara, Jr. held a timber license in Claveria, Misamis Oriental. After his license was not renewed in 1962, P & B Enterprises Co., Inc. was granted a concession over a larger area, including De Lara's former area, and constructed a logging road costing P139,000. Subsequently, De Lara’s license was renewed for 1963, overlapping with P & B’s concession. P & B protested to the Director of Forestry, who overruled it. P & B then appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources. While the appeal was pending, the Secretary directed De Lara to refrain from operating in the contested area. De Lara disregarded this and continued logging, utilizing P & B’s private road. P & B filed a complaint for injunction and damages with the CFI of Manila, which issued an *ex parte* writ of preliminary injunction. De Lara moved to dismiss, arguing P & B failed to exhaust administrative remedies as the appeal was still pending. The CFI denied the motion. De Lara filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the preliminary injunction despite the non-exhaustion of administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the rule of exhaustion of administrative remedies is not applicable if it appears that irreparable damage and injury will be suffered by a party if they await the final action of the administrative official. In this case, De Lara defied the Secretary's directive to refrain from entering and operating within the contested area pending the final decision. This act of defiance caused irreparable damage to P & B, justifying immediate court action. The lower court properly issued the injunction to maintain the *status quo* and enforce the administrative directive.

Petition is dismissed.
