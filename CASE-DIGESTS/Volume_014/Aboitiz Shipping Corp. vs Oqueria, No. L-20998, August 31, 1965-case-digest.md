I. CAPTION
ABOITIZ SHIPPING CORPORATION v. DEMETRIA OQUERIA, et al., G.R. No. L-20998, August 31, 1965, Concepcion, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Sofronio Buen, a seaman employed by Aboitiz Shipping Corporation, disappeared from the vessel M/V Carmen while it was navigating the high seas on October 14, 1961 [3, 4]. The vessel's Master filed a marine protest after a futile search for the body [3]. Although Aboitiz was aware of the disappearance on the same day, it failed to file the required Employer’s Report of Accident within the statutory period, submitting it only on January 30, 1962—198 days after the incident—after receiving a request from the Regional Office [3, 4]. Consequently, the Regional Labor Administrator deemed the claim uncontroverted and issued an award of P3,806.40 in favor of Buen’s heirs (respondents) without previous notice and hearing [4, 5]. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) sustained the award [2]. Aboitiz appealed, arguing the award was illegal due to the lack of notice and hearing and that death was merely presumed [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the award of compensation without previous notice and hearing was valid due to the employer's failure to file the accident report on time. [4, 6]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the WCC's order. Under Section 45 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, an employer is required to file an Employer's Report of Accident within 14 days of the accident or 10 days of acquiring knowledge thereof [4]. Aboitiz failed to submit the report within this period despite knowing of the accident on October 14, 1961, and offered no reasonable grounds for this failure to the Commissioner [4]. By failing to report within the statutory period, the petitioner is deemed to have renounced its right to controvert the claim and is considered to have admitted the validity of the respondents' claim [4]. Therefore, the Regional Labor Administrator was justified in making the award immediately without previous notice and hearing [4, 7]. Additionally, the Court noted that death was properly deduced from the fact that Buen disappeared at sea, likely falling overboard while intoxicated, and his body was not found despite diligent search [8].

The order and resolution appealed from are affirmed [9].
