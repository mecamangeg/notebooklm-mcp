I. CAPTION
**REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AYALA Y CIA. and/or HACIENDA CALATAGAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20950, May 31, 1965, Barrera, J.**

II. FACTS
The Republic of the Philippines filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Batangas against Ayala y Cia., Alfonso Zobel, and the Dizons (purchasers of lots from Ayala) to annul titles allegedly covering territorial waters [1]. The Republic claimed Ayala y Cia. expanded Hacienda Calatagan’s area from 9,652 hectares (TCT No. 722) to 12,000 hectares by including public domain lands in a new composite plan [1]. Miguel Tolentino and other fishpond permit holders intervened [2]. The defendants argued the excess area was merely due to inaccuracies in the original magnetic survey [2]. The trial court ruled for the Republic, finding the disputed lots (including Lot 360 held by the Dizons) were part of the foreshore and navigable waters [3]. It annulled the Dizons' TCT No. T-9550, ordered them to vacate Lot 360 in favor of Tolentino, and held the defendants liable for damages [3]. Both parties appealed, with the defendants claiming the Dizons were entitled to reimbursement for necessary expenses [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the disputed lots included in the defendants' titles should revert to the public dominion.
2. W/N the defendants Dizons are possessors in good faith entitled to the right of retention and non-liability for damages.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the factual finding that the disputed areas were portions of the foreshore, beach, or navigable water [5]. Under the elementary principle of law, such areas are not capable of registration [5]. Their inclusion in a certificate of title does not convert them into private property or confer title upon the registrant [5]. Thus, the lower court correctly ordered the reversion of these properties to the public dominion [5].

2. **YES.** The Court held that the Dizons were purchasers in good faith and for value, as they relied on the efficacy of the certificates of title issued to them [6]. Citing *Dizon v. Rodriguez*, the Court ruled that purchasers cannot be considered in bad faith until the legality of their titles has been finally determined [6]. Consequently, the Dizons have the right to retain the property until reimbursed for necessary expenses and cannot be held liable for damages [6].

The decision of the lower court was **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**; the award of damages was deleted, and the Dizons' right of retention was recognized [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
