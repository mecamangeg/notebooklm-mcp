I. CAPTION
BRUNO GARCIA v. DALMACIO ANAS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20617, May 31, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On August 3, 1957, respondent Dalmacio Anas filed a complaint for forcible entry against petitioner Bruno Garcia in the Justice of the Peace Court of Zablan, Mt. Province [1]. Anas claimed prior possession of land he purchased and expanded via patent application [2]. He alleged that in May 1957, Garcia entered the land, had it surveyed over Anas's protest, fenced it, and turned loose his carabaos thereon [2]. Garcia answered that he inherited the land from his father and had never been dispossessed [1].

The Justice of the Peace dismissed the case, ruling Garcia was entitled to possession [3]. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Baguio also dismissed the complaint, finding Anas failed to identify the land and that Garcia was the owner [3, 4]. The Court of Appeals reversed the lower courts, finding Anas was the actual possessor who was dispossessed by Garcia, and ordered Garcia to restore possession [2, 3]. Garcia petitioned for review, challenging the CA's disregard of his ownership evidence.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the issue of ownership or title is material in determining the right of possession in a forcible entry case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals, holding that in an action for ejectment, the only issue involved is one of possession *de facto* [5, 6]. The purpose of such an action is merely to protect the possessor from physical encroachment [6]. The title of the land or its ownership is not involved; if a person is in actual possession, he is entitled to be maintained and respected in it even against the owner himself [5, 6].

The Court ruled that the Court of First Instance erred in resorting to an analysis of title to determine the right to possession [6]. The main thing to be proven is prior possession; if the same is lost through force, stealth, or violence, it behooves the court to restore it regardless of title or ownership [5, 6]. Since the Court of Appeals found as a fact that Anas was the actual possessor disturbed by Garcia, that finding was binding [7].

Petition denied. Decision affirmed [7].
