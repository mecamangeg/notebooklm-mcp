I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. SERGIO TAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20021, June 23, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On February 2, 1960, Sergio Tan, a Chinese citizen born in Ozamis City, filed a petition for naturalization [1]. At the time of the hearing, he was single and employed as an assistant manager at Sing Ben Trading with a monthly salary of P200.00 [2]. His income tax returns reflected an annual income of P664.90 in 1958, P1,531.45 in 1959, and P2,269.40 in 1960 [3]. The Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental granted the petition [4]. The Republic appealed, contending that Tan’s income was too meager to satisfy the requirement of a lucrative trade or occupation [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner satisfies the requirement of having a lucrative trade or occupation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, ruling that the petitioner's income was insufficient. Even considering Tan's highest reported annual income of P2,269.40 (for 1960), it fell below the established threshold [3]. The Court applied the rule settled in previous cases, such as *Ong v. Republic*, *Koh Chet v. Republic*, and *Chuan v. Republic*, which held that an applicant with a monthly income of less than P250.00 cannot be considered as possessing a lucrative occupation as contemplated by law [3].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is REVERSED [5].
