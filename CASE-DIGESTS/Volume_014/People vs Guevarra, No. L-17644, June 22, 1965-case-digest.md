I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LAMBERTO GUEVARRA Y YCO, ET AL.; THE RURAL INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-17644, June 22, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Lamberto Guevarra was convicted of estafa and appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), posting a P15,000.00 provisional release bond subscribed by appellant Rural Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. [1]. After the CA affirmed the conviction, the Manila Court of First Instance notified the surety to produce Guevarra for the promulgation of judgment on August 7, 1959 [2]. When Guevarra failed to appear, the trial judge immediately decreed the confiscation of the bond [2]. The surety's agents exerted diligent efforts, located Guevarra in Pasig, Rizal, and surrendered him to the police on September 4, 1959 [3-5]. On September 5, 1959, the surety filed a petition for relief, seeking the lifting of the confiscation order, but the trial court dealt strictly with the surety, enforcing the forfeiture [6]. The surety appealed the forfeiture.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the amount of the confiscated bond should be reduced given the subsequent surrender of the accused.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court's discretion to set aside a forfeiture order or reduce the amount should be exercised with liberality [6]. It is for the best interest of the State to mitigate the liability of sureties in such circumstances to encourage them to aid in locating and apprehending defendants, as well as to keep bail premiums affordable (*People v. Tan*; *People v. Puyal*) [6, 7].

The Court noted that the surety's own agents arrested the convict and surrendered him. Had the surety been granted the usual 30-day period to produce the accused, they would have successfully done so [7]. Consequently, the full forfeiture was excessive.

**Judgment modified.** The forfeiture is reduced from P15,000.00 to P3,000.00 [7, 8].
