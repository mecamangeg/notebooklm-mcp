**I. CAPTION**
AGUSTIN DE AUSTRIA, CHAN YUEN YING and SY SUN KIN vs. HON. AGAPITO CONCHU, in his capacity as Commissioner of Immigration, G.R. No. L-20716, June 22, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Chan Yuen Ying and her minor son Sy Sun Kin, citizens of the Republic of China, were admitted to the Philippines as temporary visitors with a stay extended only until April 24, 1962. On March 20, 1962, Chan Yuen Ying married Agustin de Austria, a Filipino citizen. Arguing that she acquired Philippine citizenship upon marriage, she petitioned the Commissioner of Immigration to cancel her Alien Certificate of Registration (ACR). The Commissioner denied the petition, stating that marriage to a Filipino does not automatically confer citizenship and that she must possess all qualifications for naturalization.

Chan Yuen Ying and her husband filed a petition for mandamus and prohibition before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to compel the cancellation of her ACR and stop deportation. The parties stipulated that Chan Yuen Ying did not possess all the qualifications required for naturalization but argued she only needed to show she had none of the disqualifications. The CFI ruled in favor of the petitioners, ordering the cancellation of the alien registry. The Commissioner appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N an alien woman married to a Filipino citizen automatically acquires Philippine citizenship without proving she possesses all the qualifications for naturalization.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. Under Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization Law, an alien woman who marries a Filipino citizen becomes a citizen only if she "might herself be lawfully naturalized." The Court interpreted this to mean that the alien wife must prove she has **all the qualifications** required by Section 2 and **none of the disqualifications** enumerated in Section 4 of the Naturalization Law [1-3].

Since the parties stipulated that Chan Yuen Ying did not possess all the qualifications for naturalization, she did not acquire Philippine citizenship by her marriage to Agustin de Austria [4]. Consequently, her minor son, Sy Sun Kin, who relied merely on his mother's acquisition of citizenship, likewise remains an alien [5-7].

The judgment appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DISMISSED** [7].
