I. CAPTION
VISAYAN BICYCLE MANUFACTURING CO., INC. v. NATIONAL LABOR UNION and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-19997, May 19, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
The Visayan Bicycle Employees and Workers Union (VIBEMWU) affiliated with the National Labor Union (NLU). The Company refused to recognize the affiliation or enforce the existing collective bargaining agreement, and its manager threatened to dismiss the union officers if they did not withdraw from NLU [1-3]. Shortly after the union filed a strike notice, the Company dismissed union officers Fulgencio Besana and Felicisimo Rodiel for fighting within company premises during working hours [2, 4].

NLU filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP). The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found that the fight was pre-arranged and provoked by two recently hired employees as a strategy to provide a lawful cause for dismissal, noting that Besana and Rodiel had no prior record of misconduct [4, 5]. The CIR ordered their reinstatement with backwages [6]. The Company filed a Motion for Reconsideration and requested an extension to file its supporting memorandum, which the CIR denied pursuant to its "no-extension" policy [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR abused its discretion in denying the motion for extension to file a supporting memorandum.
2. W/N the dismissal of the union officers constituted Unfair Labor Practice.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The CIR did not abuse its discretion. The Court held that the denial of a motion to extend the 10-day period to file arguments in support of a motion for reconsideration is valid when done pursuant to the CIR's standing rule against such extensions [8]. The Court cited *Luzon Stevedoring Co., Inc. v. CIR* in affirming this procedural rule [8].

2. **YES.** The dismissal constituted Unfair Labor Practice under Section 4(a)(1) and (4) of the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. 875) [9]. The Court found substantial evidence that the employees were provoked into the fight by agents of the Company to manufacture a ground for separation [3, 5]. Management admitted the dismissal was actually because the officer was a "hard-headed leader" [5]. The Court applied the principle that even if an employer claims a violation of rules, if the true inspiration for the act is the employee's union activities, the dismissal is discriminatory and invalid [10, 11].

The Decision and resolutions appealed from are AFFIRMED, with treble costs against petitioner [12].
