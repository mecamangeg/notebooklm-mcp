I. CAPTION
THE CITY OF CEBU v. TEODORICO LEDESMA, et al., G.R. No. L-16723, July 30, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Pursuant to resolutions providing for the construction of a supermarket, the City of Cebu (Petitioner) filed a complaint for expropriation against Ledesma and other lot owners (Respondents) after they refused the City's purchase offers [1]. The Court of First Instance of Cebu appointed three commissioners to ascertain just compensation [2]. The Majority (two commissioners) recommended P15.00 per square meter, relying on the assessed value for taxation purposes [3]. The Minority (one commissioner) recommended P30.00 per square meter [4]. The trial court rendered judgment adopting the Minority's recommendation of P30.00 per square meter, supported by documentary evidence of previous sales [4]. The City appealed, arguing the court should have followed the Majority report and the assessed value [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in accepting the minority commissioner's report over the majority's.
2. W/N the just compensation should be fixed based on the assessed value of the property.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that reports submitted by commissioners of appraisal in condemnation proceedings are not binding but merely advisory in character [5]. The trial court properly accepted the view of the minority commissioner because it was strongly supported by documentary evidence presented before the commissioners [5]. Specifically, the court relied on a Deed of Sale (Exhibit 7) where the City itself purchased nearby lots for P30.00 per square meter [5], and a private Deed of Conveyance (Exhibit 4) which corroborated the higher value [6].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that in condemnation proceedings, the assessed value of the property is deemed no more than *prima facie* evidence of its market value [7]. This presumption is rebuttable, and the parties are free to prove the contrary. In this case, the evidence of record sufficiently showed that the property sought to be condemned was worth more than its assessed value [7].

The appealed judgment is affirmed [8].
