I. CAPTION
GABRIEL P. PRIETO v. MEDEN ARROYO, JACK ARROYO, NONITO ARROYO and ZEFERINO ARROYO, JR., G.R. No. L-17885, June 30, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In 1948, Zeferino Arroyo, Sr. obtained an Original Certificate of Title (OCT) for Lot No. 2, while Gabriel Prieto obtained an OCT for the adjoining Lot No. 3. After Arroyo, Sr. died, his title was transferred to his heirs (respondents). On March 6, 1956, the respondents filed a petition (Special Proceedings No. 900) to correct the technical description in their title, claiming it was 157 square meters smaller than what was adjudicated. The court granted this on May 23, 1956.

On November 29, 1956, Prieto filed a petition to annul the May 23 order. However, he and his counsel failed to appear at the July 12, 1957 hearing, leading the trial court to dismiss the petition for "failure to prosecute." Prieto did not appeal this dismissal. On September 2, 1958, Prieto filed the present complaint to annul the same proceedings and order, adding a prayer for the reconveyance of the 157 square meters. The respondents moved to dismiss on the ground of *res judicata*. The trial court granted the motion, prompting this appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the first petition constitutes *res judicata* barring the present action.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the order of dismissal. Under Rule 30, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, a dismissal for failure to prosecute has the effect of an adjudication upon the merits unless the court provides otherwise [1]. Since Prieto failed to appeal the first dismissal, it became final and constituted a bar to the second suit.

The Court rejected Prieto's argument that the lower court should have taken judicial notice of the land registration records in the first case to dispense with the presentation of evidence. The general rule is that courts are not authorized to take judicial notice of the contents of other cases, even if pending before the same judge, absent a proper request [2].

Furthermore, there is identity of causes of action between the two suits. Both were based on the alleged nullity of Special Proceedings No. 900. The addition of a prayer for reconveyance and damages in the second case is immaterial, as the disputed area would have necessarily reverted to Prieto had his first petition prospered [3]. There being identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action, the second action is barred [4].

**Order affirmed.**
