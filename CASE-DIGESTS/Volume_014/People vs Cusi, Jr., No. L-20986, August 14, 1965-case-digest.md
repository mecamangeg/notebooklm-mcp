I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. VICENTE N. CUSI, JR., ARCADIO PUESCA, WALTER APA, JOSE GUSTILO, FILOMENO MACALINAO, JR., RICARDO DAIRO, and MAGNOMONTANO, G.R. No. L-20986, August 14, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In Criminal Case No. 6813 before the Court of First Instance of Davao, Arcadio Puesca and several others were charged with robbery in band with homicide [1]. During trial, prosecution witness Sgt. Lucio Baño testified regarding an extrajudicial confession made by accused Puesca, wherein Puesca admitted his participation and revealed the names of his co-conspirators [1]. When the prosecutor asked Sgt. Baño to state the names mentioned by Puesca, the counsel for co-accused Macalinao, Gustilo, and Dairo objected on the ground of hearsay [1]. Respondent Judge Cusi ruled that the witness could answer but must not mention the names of the accused who had objected [1, 2]. The prosecution filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied, leading to this petition for certiorari [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the witness should be allowed to testify on the specific names mentioned in the extrajudicial confession despite the hearsay objection.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the testimony is admissible for a limited purpose. While testimony regarding a statement made by another is hearsay if intended to establish the truth of the facts asserted, it is not hearsay if the purpose is merely to establish the fact that the statement was made or the tenor of such statement [3].

Here, the prosecution manifested that the purpose was only to establish the fact that accused Puesca had mentioned the names of the alleged co-conspirators to Sgt. Baño, without claiming that the statement would be competent evidence to prove that the persons named actually conspired with him [4]. Citing *People vs. Lew Yon* and Wigmore, the Court held the question proper and directed that the witness be allowed to answer in full, with the understanding that the answer is not competent evidence of actual conspiracy [3, 4].

The petition was granted [5].
