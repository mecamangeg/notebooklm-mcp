I. CAPTION
JOSE A. SANTOS Y DIAZ v. ANATOLIO BUENCONSEJO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20136, June 23, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Lot No. 1917, covered by Original Certificate of Title No. RO-3848, was originally owned in common by Anatolio Buenconsejo (1/2 undivided portion) and Lorenzo and Santiago Bon (the other 1/2) [1]. Anatolio's rights were sold at a public auction to Atty. Tecla San Andres Ziga [1]. Petitioner Jose A. Santos y Diaz subsequently redeemed the share from Ziga, claiming to act as the Attorney-in-fact of Anatolio's children (Anastacio, Elena, and Azucena) based on a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) executed by them [1, 2].

Relying on this redemption and SPA, Petitioner claimed to have acquired Anatolio’s share in his own name [2]. He unilaterally caused a subdivision plan to be made, segregating his alleged portion as Lot No. 1917-A, and filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Albay for the issuance of a separate title for said lot [2, 3]. Anatolio, who was still alive, opposed the petition [4]. The lower court denied the petition, ruling that the children had no authority to bind their living father and that a co-owner cannot segregate a specific portion without partition [4]. Petitioner appealed [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Petitioner Santos acquired proprietary rights over Anatolio’s share in his own name via the Special Power of Attorney executed by Anatolio's children.
2. W/N a co-owner can adjudicate a determinate portion of pro indiviso property to himself without the consent of other co-owners.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the Special Power of Attorney merely authorized the Petitioner to act on behalf of the children of Anatolio Buenconsejo; hence, it could not have vested any property right in the Petitioner’s own name [4]. Furthermore, the children had no authority to execute a power of attorney for their father, Anatolio, who was still alive and actually opposed the petition [4].

2. **NO.** Even assuming the redemption was valid, the Petitioner would have only acquired the *pro indiviso* share of Anatolio [4]. A co-owner cannot, without the conformity of the other co-owners (Lorenzo and Santiago Bon) or a judicial decree of partition issued pursuant to Rule 69 of the Rules of Court, adjudicate to himself in fee simple a determinate portion (Lot No. 1917-A) of the property owned in common to the exclusion of the others [4].

The Order appealed from is **AFFIRMED**, with treble costs against the Petitioner [5].
