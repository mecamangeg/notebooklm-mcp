**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. PANTALEON SIA *alias* ALFREDO SIA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20290, August 31, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Pantaleon Sia, born in Tayabas, Quezon to Chinese parents, filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila on January 30, 1961. He did not file a declaration of intention one year prior, claiming exemption due to his birth in the Philippines and completion of secondary education in a government-recognized school. Sia attended Grades 1 and 2 at a public school, but completed the remainder of his elementary education and first year of high school at Chia-Nan School (now Hope Christian High School), a Chinese school. He admitted he had no Filipino classmates at Chia-Nan.

Regarding his financial capacity, Sia was employed as a sales agent with a monthly salary of P200.00 (P2,400.00 annually) at the time he filed his petition. He lived with his parents with free board and lodging. While he received bonuses and commissions in 1960 and 1961, these were in excess of his regular salary. The CFI granted his petition. The Republic appealed, questioning his exemption from the declaration of intention and the lucrative nature of his income.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a declaration of intention.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative income.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The petitioner is not exempt. Under Section 6 of the Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473), a native-born applicant claiming exemption from the declaration of intention must prove that all schools attended for primary and secondary education were not limited to any race or nationality. Sia failed to prove that Chia-Nan School was open to all nationalities *at the time he was enrolled*. The Court held that a 1962 certification stating the school was not limited to any race was insufficient to cover the period of his actual attendance.

2. **NO.** The petitioner does not possess a lucrative income. The determination of lucrative income is reckoned as of the time the petitioner files the application. Bonuses and commissions are excluded from this calculation because they are "indefinite and unsteady." An annual fixed income of P2,400.00, even with free board and lodging, is not considered lucrative for a single applicant given the high cost of living and the low purchasing power of the peso.

The appealed judgment is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DISMISSED**.
