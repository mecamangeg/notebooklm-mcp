I. CAPTION
PEDRO CRISOLOGO and EUFRASIA CAPIAO v. ALFREDO L. DURAL, G.R. No. L-19885, July 31, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners-spouses Crisologo and Capiao mortgaged a house and lot to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (now DBP) to secure a P25,000.00 loan. The mortgage was foreclosed, and DBP acquired the property. Before the redemption period expired, petitioners assigned their rights of redemption to respondent Dural for P3,000.00 based on an alleged verbal understanding that they could redeem the property from him anytime. Dural subsequently secured a Conditional Sale from DBP and took possession. When Dural refused to allow the redemption, petitioners filed a complaint for Reconveyance and Damages in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Isabela.

During the scheduled hearing on June 28, 1961, petitioners' counsel, Atty. Verzosa, failed to appear due to influenza. However, petitioner Capiao was present and presented a telegram from their counsel requesting a continuance. The trial court denied the motion for postponement and dismissed the complaint for insufficiency of evidence. Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration supported by medical certificates, which the trial court denied.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in denying the motion for continuance and dismissing the complaint due to the non-appearance of counsel.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Motions for continuance are addressed to the sound discretion of the court, but this discretion must be exercised wisely (*Capital Subdiv. v. Prov. of Neg. Occ.*). The Supreme Court found that the petitioners were not neglectful of their duties, as one of the plaintiffs was present and presented the telegram requesting postponement. A reasonably justified continuance to afford a party the opportunity to present evidence would not materially prejudice the defendant; rather, it would serve the ends of fair play and justice.

The Court emphasized that procedural technicalities should not bar the vindication of a legitimate grievance (*PHHC v. Tiongco*). Counsel’s failure to appear was an excusable *lapsus*, and given the value of the litigation (approx. P70,000.00) and the fact that a witness had already been presented, the dismissal was not warranted.

**Order set aside and case remanded to court of origin for further proceedings.**
