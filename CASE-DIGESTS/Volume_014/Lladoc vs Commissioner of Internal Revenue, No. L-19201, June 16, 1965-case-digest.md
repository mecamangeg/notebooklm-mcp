I. CAPTION
REV. FR. CASIMIRO LLADOC v. THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-19201, June 16, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
In 1957, M.B. Estate, Inc. donated P10,000.00 in cash to Rev. Fr. Crispin Ruiz, the then parish priest of Victorias, Negros Occidental, for the construction of a new Catholic Church [1]. The total amount was spent for the intended purpose [1]. On April 29, 1960, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) issued an assessment for donee’s gift tax against the Catholic Parish of Victorias, where petitioner Rev. Fr. Casimiro Lladoc was the incumbent priest [2]. Lladoc protested the assessment, arguing that he was not the priest at the time of the donation and that the imposition of the tax violated the Constitutional exemption of properties used for religious purposes [2, 3]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the tax liability but removed the compromise penalty [4]. Lladoc appealed to the Supreme Court. During the proceedings, the Supreme Court substituted the Roman Catholic Bishop of Bacolod (Head of the Diocese) as the petitioner, recognizing him as the real party in interest [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the imposition of a donee's gift tax on property used exclusively for religious purposes violates the Constitution.
2. W/N Rev. Fr. Lladoc is personally liable for the gift tax.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the exemption under Section 22(3), Article VI of the Constitution (1935) applies only to property taxes assessed on the enumerated properties (churches, parsonages, etc.), as contradistinguished from excise taxes [7]. A gift tax is not a property tax but an excise tax imposed on the transfer of property by way of gift *inter vivos* and on the privilege of receiving such property [7]. Therefore, imposing a gift tax on property used exclusively for religious purposes does not violate the Constitution [7].

2. **NO.** The Court held that Lladoc is not personally liable because he was not the parish priest at the time of the donation [5]. The Head of the Diocese to which the parish pertains is the real party in interest and is the one liable for the payment of the donee's gift tax [5, 6].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **AFFIRMED** with **MODIFICATION**; the Head of the Diocese is ordered to pay the gift tax [8].
