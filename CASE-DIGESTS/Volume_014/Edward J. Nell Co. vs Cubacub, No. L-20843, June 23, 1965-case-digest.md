I. CAPTION
THE EDWARD J. NELL COMPANY v. RICARDO CUBACUB and THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-20843, June 23, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Ricardo Cubacub was an employee of petitioner Edward J. Nell Co. receiving P4.50 a day. In October 1955, the company refused to allow him to work due to a pending homicide case against him [1]. Cubacub alleged that the company promised to reinstate him as soon as the criminal case was settled. He was convicted in 1958 and imprisoned until his release on parole in April 1962 [1]. upon his release, he requested reinstatement but was rejected due to a lack of vacancy.

Cubacub filed a petition for reinstatement and damages with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [1, 2]. Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction, prescription, and lack of cause of action [2]. The CIR deferred the resolution of the motion until trial to determine questions of law and fact simultaneously [3]. After his motion for reconsideration was denied, petitioner filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over the respondent's claim for reinstatement based on an alleged promise to rehire.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that for the CIR to have jurisdiction, two requirements must be met: (a) there exists an employer-employee relationship or the claimant seeks reinstatement; AND (b) the controversy relates to a case certified by the President as involving national interest, or has a bearing on an unfair labor practice charge, or arises under the Eight-Hour Labor Law or the Minimum Wage Law [4].

While Cubacub sought reinstatement, his claim did not involve any of the secondary circumstances (national interest, ULP, or labor standards laws) [4]. The Court found that Cubacub virtually ceased to be an employee when he served his prison sentence from 1958 to 1962 [5]. His petition was essentially an action for specific performance to enforce the alleged promise of the employer to take him back, a matter cognizable by ordinary courts and not the CIR [5].

The Court further held that while an order deferring a motion to dismiss is interlocutory, it may be corrected by a writ of certiorari if the lack of jurisdiction is clear from the allegations of the complaint [6].

The writ is **GRANTED** and the respondent court is ordered to desist from taking cognizance of the case [7].
