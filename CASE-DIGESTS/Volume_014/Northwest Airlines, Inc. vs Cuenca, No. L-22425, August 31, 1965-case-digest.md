I. CAPTION
NORTHWEST AIRLINES, INC. v. NICOLAS L. CUENCA and COURT OF APPEALS (SPECIAL SIXTH DIVISION), G.R. No. L-22425, August 31, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Nicolas L. Cuenca, the Commissioner of Public Highways, boarded petitioner Northwest Airlines' plane in Manila with a first-class ticket to Tokyo. Although the ticket was marked "W/L" (wait-listed), Cuenca was not advised of this and was given first-class accommodation upon boarding. Upon arrival in Okinawa, an agent of the petitioner rudely compelled him, in the presence of other passengers, to move to the tourist class. Cuenca protested, revealing he was traveling in his official capacity as a delegate of the Republic of the Philippines to a conference, but obeyed to reach the conference on time [1-4].

The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Cuenca, awarding P20,000 in moral damages, P5,000 in exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision but eliminated the exemplary damages and converted the P20,000 moral damages into nominal damages [5, 6]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that under the Warsaw Convention, an air carrier is liable only for death, injury, or baggage loss/delay, and not for other breaches of contract [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Warsaw Convention excludes air carrier liability for breaches of contract not specifically enumerated in Articles 17, 18, and 19.
2. W/N the award of P20,000 as nominal damages is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Articles 17, 18, and 19 of the Warsaw Convention of 1929 merely declare air carriers liable for damages in the specific cases enumerated therein (death, injury, loss/damage of baggage, delay). Neither these articles nor other provisions of the Convention regulate or exclude liability for other breaches of contract by air carriers. To adopt the petitioner's theory would lead to the absurd result that a carrier could be exempt from liability for an absolute refusal, in bad faith, to comply with a contract of carriage [7].

2. **YES.** The Court held that Cuenca was entitled to believe his first-class reservation was confirmed having been given such accommodation in Manila. The breach was committed with full knowledge that he was an official representative of the Republic of the Philippines. Considering the petitioner's agent acted in a wanton, reckless, and oppressive manner, the P20,000 award is justified as nominal damages, or even as exemplary damages [3, 4].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [8].
