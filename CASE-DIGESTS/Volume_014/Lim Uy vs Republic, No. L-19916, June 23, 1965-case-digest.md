I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. ALEXANDER LIM UY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19916, June 23, 1965, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner-appellee Alexander Lim Uy, a citizen of Nationalist China born in Ozamis City, filed a petition for naturalization [1]. The Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental granted the petition, finding him qualified [1, 2]. The Republic appealed, arguing two main errors [3]. First, during the hearing, witnesses and counsel revealed the petitioner was also known as "Alejandro Lim Uy," a name not included in his petition or the published notice of hearing [4, 5]. Second, the petitioner claimed an average annual income of P3,100 derived solely from a share in the profits of a partnership, "Lim Uy & Co.," inherited from his father [1, 6]. At the time of filing, he was a 21-year-old student at Mapua Institute of Technology with no actual participation in the management of said partnership [1, 7]. His mother's income tax returns showed his alleged share fluctuated and was not steady [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to state all aliases in the petition for naturalization is a fatal defect.
2. W/N an annual income of P3,100 derived from partnership profits constitutes a lucrative trade or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The failure to state all names by which a petitioner is known constitutes a fatal defect and is sufficient ground to deny the petition [8]. The petitioner was proven to be known as "Alejandro Lim Uy," yet this was not included in the petition or publication [8]. This omission deprives the public of the opportunity to come forward with information regarding the applicant, rendering the publication incomplete and insufficient to confer jurisdiction [9]. The Court relied on *Yu Seco v. Republic* and *Saw Cen v. Republic*.

2. **NO.** An income of P3,100 per year is not considered lucrative, even for a single individual [10]. To be considered lucrative, income must be assessed based on its source, steadiness, and the recipient's actual participation [7]. Here, the petitioner was a student with no hand in the management of the business, making his income dependent on fluctuating partnership profits that could be wiped out at any time [7, 10]. Furthermore, citing *Yap v. Republic* and *Albert Ong Lin Cuan v. Republic*, the Court held that a monthly income of roughly P258 is not lucrative [10, 11].

The decision appealed from is REVERSED [11].
