I. CAPTION
ANDRES CASTILLO v. JUAN RODRIGUEZ, as Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, ZOILO CASTRILLO, as Director of Lands, and ELIAS L. CASALS, represented by CAMILO CASALS, G.R. No. L-17189, June 22, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
The dispute involves a parcel of public land claimed by both petitioner Andres Castillo and respondent Elias Casals. Casals, continuing his father's possession, filed Miscellaneous Sales Application (M.S.A.) No. 16888 on June 4, 1952. Castillo, whose house was affected by a street construction project, moved onto the subject land with the permission of Casals' mother. Castillo later refused to vacate and filed his own application, M.S.A. No. 19124, on May 19, 1953.

The District Land Officer awarded the land to Casals, a ruling sustained by the Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources (respondent Rodriguez). Castillo appealed to the Office of the President, and the Executive Secretary rendered a decision affirming the Department's action. Castillo then filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu against the Secretary, the Director, and Casals, but failed to implead the Executive Secretary. The CFI dismissed the petition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition was proper despite failing to implead the Executive Secretary whose decision superseded that of the respondents.
2. W/N the factual findings of the Director of Lands and Secretary of Agriculture are binding on the courts.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the decision of the Executive Secretary was the last, binding, and operative decision, which superseded the decisions handed down by the Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Since the Executive Secretary was not made a party to the suit and his decision was not the subject matter of the appeal, his decision lapsed into finality. The Court and the lower court acquired no jurisdiction over him, and any ruling against the subordinate officials would have no binding effect on the final decision of the Office of the President [1].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the decision of the Director of Lands, affirmed by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, on a factual matter is binding on the courts [2], [3]. The record showed Casals filed his application ahead of Castillo and possessed no disqualification. The Court cited *Julian v. Apostol* (52 Phil. 422), stating that findings of administrative officials not shown to be wanting in evidentiary basis should not be disturbed [4], [3].

The appeal is dismissed [3].
