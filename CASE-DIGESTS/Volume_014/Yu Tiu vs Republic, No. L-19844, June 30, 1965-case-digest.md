I. CAPTION
*In the Matter of the Petition for Philippine Citizenship. Frank Yu Tiu v. Republic of the Philippines*, G.R. No. L-19844, June 30, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Frank Yu Tiu filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental [2]. He works as a storekeeper with an annual salary of P5,000.00 [3]. Together with his wife, their combined annual income was approximately P6,600.00 to P7,080.00 [3, 4]. They have five minor children, one of whom was already of school age at the time of the petition [4, 5]. The trial court granted the petition [3]. The Republic appealed, opposing the grant of citizenship on the grounds that there was no proof of posting of the petition and notice of hearing, and that the petitioner lacked a lucrative trade or occupation given his low income and large family [4, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to prove the posting of the petition and notice of hearing is fatal to the application.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The lack of proof of posting copies of the petition and the notice of hearing in a public or conspicuous place is fatal to the validity of the petition [6, 7]. The Court reasoned that the purpose of the law is to give publicity to the petition to inform the people of the place where the petitioner resides of his desire to become a Filipino citizen, so they may raise any objections they have against him [6]. This requirement is essential and mandatory [6].

2. **NO.** The petitioner’s combined annual income is not considered lucrative considering he has a wife and five minor children to support [4]. The Court found that an income of roughly P6,600.00 is hardly sufficient to provide a decent living, especially as the children's education will become an additional financial burden [4]. Citing *Keng Giok vs. Republic*, the Court noted that due to the high cost of living and low purchasing power of the peso, such an income is insufficient to ensure the petitioner does not become a public charge [8].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DISMISSED** [9].
