I. CAPTION
CONSUELO VDA. DE PRIETO v. PACIENCIA REYES and her husband “John Doe”, G.R. No. L-21470, June 23, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Consuelo Vda. de Prieto (plaintiff-appellee) owned a lot in the New Legarda Estate, Manila [1]. Through stealth, strategy, and misrepresentation, Paciencia Reyes (defendant-appellant) built a *barong-barong* (shack) on the lot without the owner's knowledge or consent [2]. Reyes claimed she had been a *bona fide* occupant since December 3, 1948, having purchased the house and right of occupation from a previous dweller [2]. Prieto only learned of the intrusion in January 1952 and sent demands to vacate in February 1952 [3]. Upon Reyes’ refusal, Prieto filed a complaint for illegal detainer on April 7, 1952 in the Municipal Court [2], [4].

Reyes moved to dismiss, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction because the action was not filed within one year from the unlawful deprivation of possession (which she claimed started in 1948) [2], [5]. The Municipal Court denied the motion and ordered Reyes to vacate. The Court of First Instance affirmed this decision [1], [6]. The case was certified to the Supreme Court on questions of law [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the one-year period for filing an action for illegal detainer based on stealth is counted from the date of actual entry.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the one-year period is not counted from the date of actual entry when entry is obtained by stealth.

There is a natural difference between entry secured by force and one obtained by stealth; in the latter, the owner cannot be expected to enforce their right to possession before learning of the clandestine intrusion [5]. To rule otherwise would reward clandestine usurpations simply because the intruder concealed the trespass for more than a year [5]. Furthermore, the Court reiterated the doctrine that possession by tolerance becomes illegal only from the time there is a demand to vacate [7]. Therefore, the one-year period for bringing the action for illegal detainer counts only from such demand [7]. Since the first demand was made in February 1952 and the complaint was filed in April 1952, the action was within the jurisdictional period [4].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [4].
