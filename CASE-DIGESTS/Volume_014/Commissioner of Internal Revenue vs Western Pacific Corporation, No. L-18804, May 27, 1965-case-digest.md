I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. WESTERN PACIFIC CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-18804, May 27, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Western Pacific Corporation received a deficiency tax assessment from the petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) on March 2, 1959 [1]. The respondent formally assailed the assessment only on June 29, 1959, arguing prescription and the impropriety of disallowed deductions [1]. Following an exchange of communications, the CIR sent a final letter dated October 28, 1959, demanding payment [2]. On December 18, 1959, the respondent filed a Petition for Review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [2].

The CTA assumed jurisdiction and rendered judgment absolving the respondent from tax liability, noting that although the assessment was validly issued (the deadline falling on a Saturday extended it to the next business day), the respondent was not liable for the amount [3, 4]. The CIR appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the CTA lacked jurisdiction to entertain the case as the assessment had already become final [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Tax Appeals had jurisdiction to entertain the petition for review.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the CTA lacked jurisdiction because the petition for review was filed out of time [6].

Under Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125, a petition for review must be filed within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the assessment [6]. The Court emphasized that this 30-day period is jurisdictional [6]. The respondent received the assessment on March 2, 1959, but only challenged it on June 29, 1959, well beyond the 30-day limit [1]. Even if the period were reckoned from the CIR's letter of October 28, 1959, the filing on December 18, 1959, was still late [1].

Citing *Pangasinan Transportation Co. v. Blaquera* and *Gibbs & Gibbs v. Coll. of Int. Rev. & CTA*, the Court held that failure to comply with the statutory period bars appeal and deprives the CTA of jurisdiction to determine the correctness of the assessment [1, 6]. Since the assessment had become final, executory, and demandable, the CTA could not validly absolve the respondent.

The decision of the CTA is SET ASIDE, and Western Pacific Corporation is ordered to pay the assessment with applicable surcharges and interest [7].
