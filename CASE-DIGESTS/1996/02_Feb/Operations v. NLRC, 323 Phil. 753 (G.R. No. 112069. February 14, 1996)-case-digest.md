I. CAPTION
INDUSTRIAL TIMBER CORPORATION - STANPLY OPERATIONS, PETITIONERS, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, JUANITO PABATANG, EDGARDO BANIAS AND ALLAN WACAN, RESPONDENTS, G.R. No. 112069, February 14, 1996, 323 Phil. 753, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondents were employees of petitioner’s labor contractor. Following a strike settlement in April 1986, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was executed providing for the absorption of contractual workers as regular employees of petitioner [1]. Petitioner failed to absorb private respondents, prompting them to file complaints for illegal dismissal [1]. The NLRC ordered petitioner to absorb private respondents, a decision which attained finality [2]. However, execution became impossible because petitioner ceased operations in March 1990 after its wood processing permit was not renewed [3].

Consequently, the Labor Arbiter issued an Order declaring reinstatement impossible and directing petitioner to pay separation pay and back wages for three years [3]. The NLRC affirmed this award with modifications, deleting holiday and 13th-month pay but sustaining the back wages and separation pay [3, 4]. Petitioner challenged the award of back wages, arguing that back wages are not proper absent a finding of illegal dismissal [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the employees are entitled to back wages in the absence of a finding of illegal dismissal when reinstatement is no longer feasible due to business cessation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that back wages may be granted only when there is a finding of illegal dismissal [5]. In this case, neither the Labor Arbiter nor the NLRC made a specific factual finding of illegal dismissal [6]. Back wages are intended to restore earnings lost due to an illegal termination; without such a finding, the award lacks legal basis [5, 7].

Instead, the proper remedy is separation pay. Under Article 283 of the Labor Code, in cases of closure or cessation of operations not due to serious business losses, the law mandates the payment of separation pay, not back wages [5, 8]. Citing *Galindez v. Rural Bank of Llanera, Inc.*, the Court held that when reinstatement is rendered legally impossible due to business closure, separation pay is awarded in lieu of reinstatement [7, 9]. Thus, the employees are entitled to separation pay computed from the commencement of their employment until the cessation of operations in August 1990 [10].

The petition is **PARTIALLY GRANTED**. The award for back wages is **DELETED**, and petitioner is **ORDERED** to pay private respondents separation pay equivalent to one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of service, or one (1) month pay, whichever is higher [10].
