I. CAPTION
NATIONAL FOOD AUTHORITY AND ROMEO G. DAVID v. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, et al., G.R. Nos. 115121-25, February 9, 1996, 323 Phil. 558, Puno, J.

II. FACTS
In 1993, National Food Authority (NFA) Administrator Romeo David created a committee to conduct a public bidding for security services. Incumbent security agencies, including private respondents, participated [1, 2]. However, disqualified agencies and respondent Lasala filed complaints, leading two RTC branches to issue restraining orders that prevented the bidding scheduled for June 30, 1993 [3]. Consequently, Administrator David terminated the services of the incumbent agencies effective August 16, 1993, citing expiration of contracts and loss of trust [4]. To replace them, David hired seven new agencies through negotiated contracts on a month-to-month basis, claiming an emergency situation to protect NFA assets [5, 6]. Private respondents filed suits in various RTC branches, which issued injunctions stopping the NFA from awarding the new contracts [5]. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the injunctions against the new negotiated contracts but ruled that NFA could terminate the expired contracts of the incumbents [7, 8]. NFA petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing the negotiated contracts were valid due to the emergency [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the private respondents were precluded from filing suit due to failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
2. W/N the NFA's negotiated security contracts were valid and justified by an emergency exception to the public bidding requirement.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies is not absolute and admits of exceptions. In this case, the private respondents' contracts were terminated amidst bidding preparations, and replacements were hired barely five days later [9]. An appeal to the NFA Board or the Secretary of Agriculture would not have been a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy given the urgency of the situation [9].

2. **NO.** The alleged "emergency" leading to the negotiated contracts was self-created by the petitioners. The security vacuum arose only because NFA chose to terminate the incumbent agencies after the bidding was enjoined, rather than maintaining the status quo [10, 11]. The incumbents were willing to continue service on a provisional basis [12]. A competitive public bidding is the general rule to protect public interest and preclude anomalies [13]. The General Appropriations Act of 1993 does not exempt the NFA from the requirement of public bidding for service contracts [14]. Furthermore, the petitioners' continued delay in conducting a valid bidding despite Supreme Court orders cast doubt on their good faith and smacked of favoritism [13, 15].

The petition is **DISMISSED**, and the decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED** [16].
