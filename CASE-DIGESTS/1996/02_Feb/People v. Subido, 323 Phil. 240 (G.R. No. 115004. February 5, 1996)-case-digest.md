I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ANAGARIO SUBIDO Y YAMSON, G.R. No. 115004, February 5, 1996, 323 Phil. 240, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Anagario Subido was charged with rape for allegedly sexually abusing 15-year-old Alejandra Mendoza on February 9, 1992, in Pasay City. The prosecution claimed that Subido forced Mendoza into a dark, unlit construction site, covered her mouth, held her hands, and raped her [1, 2]. Subido pleaded not guilty, asserting that he and Mendoza were sweethearts and that the sexual intercourse was consensual [3]. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) convicted Subido, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* or life imprisonment and ordering him to pay damages [4, 5]. Subido appealed, arguing that no force or intimidation was employed [6]. The Solicitor General, representing the People, recommended acquittal due to the prosecution's failure to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused is guilty of rape beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the RTC decision and acquitted the accused. The Court emphasized that in rape cases, the victim's testimony must be clear, convincing, and free from material contradiction [7]. Here, the prosecution failed to prove the absolute lack of voluntariness [8].

The Court found the complainant's conduct inconsistent with that of a victim of forcible abuse: (1) she consented to pass through a dark alley; (2) she failed to shout for help despite passing inhabited areas and the accused being unarmed; and (3) after the alleged rape, she asked the accused to wash his shirt in a canal to hide the act, which is unnatural for an outraged woman [8, 9]. Furthermore, she only accused Subido after being "grilled" by her sisters [9]. Material contradictions also marred her credibility; while her affidavit claimed she was dragged from a specific spot, her court testimony admitted she was walking with the accused [10, 11]. Citing *People v. Dulay*, the Court held that a judgment of conviction must be reversed when strong indications point to the charge being motivated by factors other than the truth [12].

The appealed judgment was **REVERSED** and **SET ASIDE**, and the accused was **ACQUITTED** on reasonable doubt [13].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Narvasa, C.J., Davide, Jr., Melo, and Francisco, JJ., concurred [13].
