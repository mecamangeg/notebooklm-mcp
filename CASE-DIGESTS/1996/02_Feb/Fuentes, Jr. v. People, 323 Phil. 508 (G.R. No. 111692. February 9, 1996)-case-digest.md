I. CAPTION
ALEJANDRO FUENTES, JR. v. COURT OF APPEALS AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. 111692, February 9, 1996, 323 Phil. 508, Bellosillo, J.

II. FACTS
On June 24, 1989, at a benefit dance in Agusan del Sur, petitioner Alejandro Fuentes, Jr. approached Julieto Malaspina, made a remark about his hair, and suddenly stabbed him in the abdomen. Before dying, Malaspina identified petitioner as his assailant. Petitioner claimed mistaken identity, alleging that his cousin, Zoilo "Jonie" Fuentes, Jr., was the real killer. Petitioner and his uncle testified that Zoilo confessed to the killing before fleeing the town. The RTC convicted petitioner of Murder qualified by treachery, which the Court of Appeals affirmed. Petitioner appeals, arguing that Zoilo’s alleged confession should be admitted as a declaration against penal interest, an exception to the hearsay rule.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the alleged extrajudicial confession of Zoilo Fuentes, Jr. is admissible as a declaration against penal interest.
2. W/N the award of actual damages based solely on testimony is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The alleged confession is inadmissible. Under Sec. 38, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, three requisites must be met for a declaration against interest to be admissible: (a) the declarant is unable to testify; (b) the declaration concerns a fact cognizable by the declarant; and (c) the circumstances render it improbable that a motive to falsify existed. Here, the declarant Zoilo was not "unable to testify" merely because he was absent or had fled; the defense failed to show he was dead or physically incompetent. Furthermore, the declaration was untrustworthy because Zoilo, being the petitioner’s cousin, had a motive to prevaricate. The Court distinguished this from *People v. Toledo*, noting that admitting such unauthenticated statements from relatives who have fled would encourage the fabrication of falsehoods.

2. **NO.** To recover actual damages, the amount of loss must be proven with a reasonable degree of certainty based on competent proof (Art. 2199, Civil Code). The Court deleted the P8,300.00 award because it was supported only by the testimony of the victim's sister without any receipts (*People v. Wenceslao*).

The petition is **DENIED**. The CA decision is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the penalty is increased to *reclusion perpetua* and the award of actual damages is deleted.
