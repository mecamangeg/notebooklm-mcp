I. CAPTION
BENJAMIN PAREDES, ET AL. v. COURT OF APPEALS, RIZALINO S. NAVARRO, AND IGNACIO S. SAPAL, G.R. No. 113357, February 1, 1996, 323 Phil. 150, Kapunan, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Secretary of Trade and Industry and the Director of the Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology Transfer (BPTTT) issued Administrative Order (A.O.) Nos. 1 and 2, Series of 1992. These orders increased fees for patent and trademark registration and prohibited multi-class applications. Petitioners, registered patent agents, filed a Petition for Prohibition with the Court of Appeals (CA) to stop the implementation of these orders, arguing that the respondents failed to comply with the Cabinet approval and publication requirements mandated by Batas Pambansa (B.P.) Blg. 325. Petitioners admitted that they had requested respondents to reconsider the orders but filed the court action while the administrative process was effectively still pending. The CA dismissed the petition for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for prohibition is proper despite the petitioners' failure to await Cabinet approval of the administrative orders.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the petition. Prohibition is an extraordinary remedy available only when there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Section 2 of B.P. Blg. 325 expressly provides that the revision of fees and charges is "subject to the approval of the Cabinet." This requirement constitutes an administrative remedy that allows the Cabinet to review and approve or disapprove the proposed rates.

Since the questioned A.O.s had not yet been submitted to the Cabinet for approval, the administrative process was not complete. Judicial review is premature under the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. The Court held that it will not interfere with administrative action prior to its finality. Furthermore, regarding the validity of the orders, the Court noted that under Section 5 of B.P. Blg. 325, publication can only occur *after* Cabinet approval. Since approval was pending, proper publication could not yet take place, making the orders legally ineffective at that stage, but also rendering the judicial challenge unripe.

Petition DENIED.
