I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. VIRGILIO BATULAN and RODULFO BATULAN, G.R. Nos. 100453-54, February 1, 1996, 323 Phil. 63, Regalado, J.

II. FACTS
On January 11, 1990, at around 1:00 A.M. in Taboc, Danao City, Nicolas Gonzales, Sr. and his sons, Conrado and Adolfo, were drinking in front of Conrado's store. Suddenly, gunshots were fired from the direction of Daday Gorre's house, located opposite the store. Adolfo was hit first. As Nicolas helped his son, he glanced toward the source of the shots and saw accused Virgilio Batulan pointing a rifle, with co-accused Rodulfo Batulan standing beside him. Conrado and Nicolas were subsequently hit; Conrado and Adolfo died, while Nicolas survived. Another witness, Camilo Ypil, also saw the accused holding firearms.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) convicted Virgilio Batulan of double murder and frustrated murder, sentencing him to *cadena perpetua* and an indeterminate penalty, respectively. Rodulfo remained at large. Virgilio appealed, arguing that positive identification was impossible because the shots came from behind the victims, and interposed the defense of alibi, claiming he was on duty as a security guard nearby.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the prosecution witnesses positively identified the accused despite the trajectory of the bullets coming from the victims' rear/left side.
2. W/N the defense of alibi is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the identification, holding that the physical evidence corroborated the testimony of the eyewitness. The medico-legal findings showed the gunshot wounds were on the left side and slightly at the back of the victims [1]. This trajectory was consistent with the victims’ position—seated on a bench with their left sides facing the house of Daday Gorre, where the assailants were positioned [2]. The Court ruled that the survivor, Nicolas, correctly glanced toward the source of the fire and identified the accused. Regarding inconsistencies in Nicolas' initial affidavit, the Court applied the doctrine that "ex-parte affidavits are generally incomplete," and inconsistencies between them and court testimony do not necessarily discredit a witness, especially considering the witness was in shock and traumatized during the initial investigation [3].

2. **NO.** The Court rejected the alibi. For the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime [4]. The defense witness admitted that the accused's guard post was only a 2-to-3-minute travel by bicycle from the crime scene and that he lost sight of the accused during rounds [5]. Thus, it was not physically impossible for the accused to leave his post, commit the crime, and return unnoticed.

The petition is **DENIED**. The RTC decision is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the penalty is denominated as *reclusion perpetua* instead of *cadena perpetua*, and the indeterminate sentence for frustrated murder is adjusted.
