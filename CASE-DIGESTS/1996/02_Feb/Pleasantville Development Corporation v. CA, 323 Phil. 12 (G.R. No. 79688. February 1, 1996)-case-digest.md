I. CAPTION
PLEASANTVILLE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION v. COURT OF APPEALS, WILSON KEE, C.T. TORRES ENTERPRISES, INC. and ELDRED JARDINICO, G.R. No. 79688, February 1, 1996, 323 Phil. 12, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Edith Robillo purchased Lot 9, Phase II of Pleasantville Subdivision from petitioner Pleasantville Development Corporation (Pleasantville). In 1975, respondent Eldred Jardinico bought the rights to the lot from Robillo and secured a title in his name in 1978. Upon inspection, Jardinico discovered that respondent Wilson Kee had introduced improvements on Lot 9.

It appeared that in 1974, Kee bought Lot 8 of the same subdivision from C.T. Torres Enterprises, Inc. (CTTEI), Pleasantville's exclusive real estate agent. After the sale, a CTTEI employee, Zenaida Octaviano, accompanied Kee's wife to the site but erroneously pointed out Lot 9 instead of Lot 8. Relying on this identification, Kee built a residence and a store on Lot 9.

When amicable settlement failed, Jardinico filed a complaint for ejectment with damages against Kee before the MTCC of Bacolod City. Kee filed a third-party complaint against Pleasantville and CTTEI. The MTCC ruled against Kee, ordering him to vacate and pay rentals, finding he had violated the installment contract terms. On appeal, the RTC affirmed the MTCC, ruling Kee was a builder in bad faith and absolving Pleasantville and CTTEI of negligence. The CA reversed the RTC, declaring Kee a builder in good faith and holding Pleasantville and CTTEI solidarily liable for damages due to negligence. Pending the petition with the Supreme Court, Kee and Jardinico entered into a deed of sale regarding Lot 9.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Kee was a builder in good faith.
2. W/N Pleasantville is liable for the acts of its agent, CTTEI.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Good faith consists in the belief of the builder that the land he is building on is his and his ignorance of any defect or flaw in his title (Art. 526, Civil Code). Kee was unaware of the "mix-up" when he began construction. He acted as a prudent man by paying for relocation and relying on the subdivision agent's positive identification of the lot. The alleged violation of the installment contract (failure to give notice of construction) refers to a contractual breach and does not negate his state of mind or good faith regarding the identity of the lot [1-3].

2. **YES.** The rule is that the principal is responsible for the acts of the agent, done within the scope of his authority, and should bear the damage caused to third persons (Art. 1910, Civil Code). CTTEI was acting within its authority as Pleasantville's sole real estate representative when it made the delivery to Kee. While CTTEI was negligent in pointing out the wrong lot, this negligence is imputable to the principal, Pleasantville, under Articles 1909 and 1910 of the Civil Code [4].

**Disposition:** The petition is **PARTIALLY GRANTED**. The CA decision is **MODIFIED**. Wilson Kee is declared a builder in good faith. Pleasantville and CTTEI are declared solidarily liable for attorney's fees (P3,000.00). However, the CA's order regarding indemnity for improvements or the price of the land under Art. 448 is **DELETED** because Kee and Jardinico had already settled their rights via a deed of sale [5-7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
