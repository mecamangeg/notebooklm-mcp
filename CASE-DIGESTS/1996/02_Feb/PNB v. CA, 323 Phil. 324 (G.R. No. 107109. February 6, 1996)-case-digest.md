I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. COURT OF APPEALS, SILVESTRA CERENA AND HEIRS OF HILARION ALONZO, G.R. No. 107109, February 6, 1996, 323 Phil. 324, Kapunan, J.

II. FACTS
Margarita Nalda, claiming to be an heir of the original owners, sold a portion of a lot to Spouses Daa, who subsequently obtained a title and mortgaged the property to Philippine National Bank (PNB) to secure various loans [1]. Upon the spouses' default, PNB foreclosed the mortgage and consolidated title in its name [2]. The legitimate heirs (Respondents) filed an action to recover the property, arguing Margarita had no authority to sell.

The trial court ruled in favor of Respondents, declaring the mortgage void because PNB was not a mortgagee in good faith. It found that PNB failed to conduct a proper ocular inspection—which would have revealed Respondents' adverse possession—and processed the loan without a loan application [3, 4]. The court ordered the cancellation of PNB's title and the return of the property to Respondents. However, it ordered Spouses Daa to indemnify PNB the amount of the loan plus interest [2, 5]. PNB appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), arguing that based on its internal circulars regarding "acquired assets," it should be indemnified the property's "fair market value" rather than just the loan amount [6]. The CA affirmed the trial court [7]. PNB elevated the case to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N PNB is entitled to be indemnified the fair market value of the property based on its internal policies regarding "acquired assets."

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that PNB is not entitled to the fair market value because the property does not qualify as an "acquired asset" under the bank's circulars [8].

The Court affirmed that PNB was a mortgagee in bad faith. A bank is expected to exercise a higher degree of care and prudence than private individuals. In this case, PNB failed to observe standard banking procedures by processing the loan without an application and failing to conduct an ocular inspection, which would have disclosed that persons other than the mortgagors were in possession of the land [4, 9, 10]. Because PNB acted in bad faith, it did not acquire a valid title to the property; its consolidation of title was null and void [8]. Since PNB never legally acquired the property, its internal policies regarding the disposition of "acquired assets" (e.g., General Circular 49-98/84) are inapplicable [11]. PNB is therefore only entitled to the indemnity ordered by the lower court (loan plus interest).

The petition is **DENIED** and the assailed decision is **AFFIRMED** [11].
