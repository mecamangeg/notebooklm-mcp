I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE BANK OF COMMUNICATIONS v. COURT OF APPEALS AND THE SPOUSES ALEJANDRO AND AMPARO CASAFRANCA, G.R. No. 118552, December 30, 1996, 323 Phil. 297, Davide, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Alejandro and Amparo Casafranca sought to recover the residue of proceeds from an auction sale of a lot they acquired from Carlos Po, which Po had mortgaged to the Philippine Bank of Communications (PBCom) to secure a P330,000.00 loan [1]. After a prior foreclosure was annulled, PBCom foreclosed on the property again in 1987, selling it for P1,184,000.00 [2]. The Spouses Casafranca claimed the residue after paying off the correct outstanding account, but a dispute arose regarding the computation: while the promissory notes signed by Po stipulated a 12% per annum penalty, the real estate mortgage contract itself did not mention any penalties [3, 4]. The Regional Trial Court ruled that the penalties were not due because they were not stipulated in the mortgage contract, and ordered PBCom to pay the residue of P273,653.32 to the spouses [5]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC decision *in toto* [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the penalties stipulated in the promissory notes may be charged against the mortgagors as part of the sums secured, despite not being mentioned in the mortgage contract [1].

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA, ruling that the mortgage contract did not authorize PBCom to include the penalties stipulated in the promissory notes in the secured amount [7]. The Court applied the general rule that "an action to foreclose a mortgage must be limited to the amount mentioned in the mortgage" [8]. Although PBCom argued that the "dragnet clause" in the mortgage—covering "all other obligations"—should include the penalties, the Court held that such clauses are strictly construed against the drafter, especially in contracts of adhesion [8, 9]. Since the mortgage contract was silent on penalties, the ambiguity was resolved against PBCom [10]. Furthermore, under the principle of *ejusdem generis*, penalty charges do not belong to the same species of obligations enumerated in the mortgage [11]. The petition was denied [12].
