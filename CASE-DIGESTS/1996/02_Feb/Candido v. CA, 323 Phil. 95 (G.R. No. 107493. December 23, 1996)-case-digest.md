I. CAPTION
NATIVIDAD CANDIDO, et al. v. COURT OF APPEALS and SOFRONIO DABU, G.R. No. 107493, December 23, 1996, 323 Phil. 95, Bellosillo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Natividad Candido and Victoria Rumbaua are co-owners of riceland in Orion, Bataan, tenanted by respondent Sofronio Dabu [1]. On July 21, 1986, petitioners filed a complaint with the RTC for termination of tenancy and recovery of unpaid rentals, alleging that the Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR) had fixed provisional rentals which Dabu failed to pay since 1983 [1]. Dabu denied the existence of the fixed provisional rentals, maintaining that the sharing system was on a 50-50 basis [2].

The RTC dismissed the complaint, ruling that petitioners failed to adduce evidence to prove the provisional rentals allegedly fixed by the MAR [3]. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the decision [4]. Petitioners filed a petition for review, arguing that the trial court erred in not considering the verified complaint and an affidavit presented to the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) as proof of the rentals, even though these documents were not formally offered during the trial [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N documents attached to pleadings but not formally offered in evidence should be considered by the court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that courts will only consider evidence that has been formally offered. Under Section 34, Rule 132 of the Revised Rules of Court, a document is not evidence when it is simply marked for identification; it must be formally offered to give the opposing counsel an opportunity to object or cross-examine [5, 6].

In this case, the affidavit of petitioner Candido and the alleged certification by the MAR were never formally offered during the trial [5]. Consequently, the trial court and CA correctly disregarded them. Furthermore, the Court cannot take judicial notice of the affidavit under Section 1, Rule 129 of the Revised Rules of Court, as it is not a matter of public knowledge or capable of unquestionable demonstration [7]. Petitioners failed to establish their cause of action [8].

The petition is **DENIED**, and the CA decision is **AFFIRMED** [8].
