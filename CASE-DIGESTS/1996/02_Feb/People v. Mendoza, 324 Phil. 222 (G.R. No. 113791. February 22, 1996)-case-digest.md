I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROLANDO MENDOZA, G.R. No. 113791, February 22, 1996, 324 Phil. 222, Davide, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
On November 22, 1989, in Sta. Maria, Bulacan, accused-appellant Rolando Mendoza was charged with parricide for setting his wife, Maria Gina, on fire [1, 2]. The prosecution’s principal witness was the couple’s son, Paul Michael, who was four years old at the time of the incident and five years old when he testified [3, 4]. Paul Michael testified that after a quarrel, his father boxed his mother, tied her hands behind her back, poured kerosene on her, and set her aflame [5, 6]. Gina died on November 30, 1989 [1].

The defense claimed that Gina committed suicide by burning herself due to financial distress [7]. Rolando fled after his wife’s death, failing to attend her wake or burial, and was only arrested later in another town [8, 9]. The Regional Trial Court convicted Rolando, relying primarily on the child’s testimony [10]. Rolando appealed, arguing that his son was not a competent witness due to his tender age and that the cause of death was "hypostatic pneumonia," not the burns [11].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a five-year-old child is a competent witness.
2. W/N the accused is criminally liable for the victim's death even if the immediate cause was hypostatic pneumonia.

IV. RULING
**1. YES.** Under Section 20, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, any child, regardless of age, can be a competent witness if they can perceive, and perceiving, can make known their perception to others [12]. The Court held that the determination of a child's competency rests primarily with the trial judge, who can observe the child's manner and intelligence [13, 14]. Here, the trial court correctly adjudged Paul Michael competent as he showed above-average intelligence and the capacity to recall and relate events truthfully [15]. His initial hesitation to testify was sufficiently explained by fear of his father, and he testified freely once the accused was placed out of his direct sight [16].

**2. YES.** The Court rejected the defense's claim that the death was not due to burns. The autopsy report listed the cause of death as "hypostatic pneumonia; infected fourth degree burns" [17]. The medical officer explained that the pneumonia was the proximate result of the victim's recumbent position, which was necessitated by the severe burns she suffered [17, 18]. Under Article 4(1) of the Revised Penal Code, an accused is liable for all the consequences of his felonious act [19].

The appeal is **DISMISSED**, and the decision of the Regional Trial Court convicting the accused is **AFFIRMED**, with the modification that the civil indemnity is increased to P50,000.00 [20].
