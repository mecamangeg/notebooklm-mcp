I. CAPTION
ROMULO DELA ROSA v. COURT OF APPEALS AND BENJAMIN MAGTOTO, G.R. No. 116945, February 9, 1996, 323 Phil. 596, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Romulo Dela Rosa was charged in nine criminal cases involving approximately P13 million. After his arraignment on June 10, 1992, several hearings were cancelled or postponed at the instance of the petitioner due to his failure to secure counsel and his counsel's prior commitments [1, 2]. Private respondent Benjamin Magtoto also requested postponements on September 16 and October 21, 1992, which were granted without objection [3].

On November 17, 1992, the private prosecutor moved to postpone the trial because the private complainant had doubts about the details of the transaction and needed time to refresh his memory [4]. Petitioner objected, invoking his constitutional right to a speedy trial, and moved for the dismissal of the cases [5]. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) granted the motion and dismissed all nine cases [6]. Private respondent filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 with the Court of Appeals (CA), which reversed the RTC orders and reinstated the cases [7]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing double jeopardy and questioning the private respondent's standing to appeal [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the private offended party has the legal standing to file a special civil action for certiorari to question the dismissal of the criminal cases.
2. W/N the reinstatement of the criminal cases violates the petitioner's right against double jeopardy.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that in a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 alleging grave abuse of discretion, the aggrieved parties are the State and the private offended party or complainant [9]. The complainant has an interest in the civil aspect of the case and may file such action in his own name, rather than in the name of the People of the Philippines [9, 10].

2. **NO.** Double jeopardy does not apply for two reasons. First, the right to speedy trial was not violated. The delay was mainly due to petitioner's own fault, having sought several postponements, which amounted to a waiver or abandonment of the right [11, 12]. The prosecution's request for postponement was not vexatious or oppressive given the complexity and amount involved; thus, the RTC's dismissal was capricious and unwarranted [12]. Second, the fourth requisite for double jeopardy—that the dismissal be without the express consent of the accused—was lacking [13]. The records showed that the dismissal was made upon the express oral motion of the petitioner's counsel [5].

The Petition is DENIED, and the Decision of the Court of Appeals reinstating the cases is AFFIRMED [10].
