I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROMEO MENDOZA Y REYES AND JAIME REJALI Y LINA, G.R. No. 104461, February 23, 1996, 324 Phil. 273, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of May 29, 1991, sisters Ma. Grace and Ma. Ramilyn Zulueta and Glory Oropeo were passengers on a jeepney traversing Aurora Blvd., San Juan. Appellants Romeo Mendoza and Jaime Rejali, armed with guns and a knife, announced a hold-up [1, 2]. They divested Oropeo of P30.00 [3]. During the commotion, Mendoza hit Ramilyn with a gun and kicked her out of the moving jeepney, causing her to fall and sustain fatal head injuries [2, 4]. Grace was also struck and injured [3]. The Regional Trial Court convicted appellants of "Robbery Hold-up with Homicide" punishable under P.D. No. 532 (Anti-Piracy and Anti-Highway Robbery Law) and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua* [5]. Appellants appealed, primarily questioning the credibility of the prosecution witnesses [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellants were correctly identified as the perpetrators.
2. W/N the crime committed falls under P.D. No. 532 (Highway Robbery/Brigandage) or Art. 294 of the Revised Penal Code (Robbery with Homicide).

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the factual findings of the trial court regarding the identification of the accused. The alleged inconsistencies in the testimonies were minor and did not negate positive identification [7]. The Court ruled that lighting from passing vehicles and inside the jeepney was sufficient for the victims to identify the appellants, especially given their physical proximity during the crime [8]. The defense of alibi was rejected as it was not physically impossible for the appellants to be at the scene given the distance [9].

2. **NO.** The crime committed is the special complex crime of **Robbery with Homicide under Art. 294 of the Revised Penal Code**. For a conviction under P.D. No. 532, the prosecution must prove that the accused were organized for the purpose of committing robbery **indiscriminately** against any person on a Philippine highway [10]. Citing *People v. Puno*, the Court held that P.D. 532 applies to brigandage where outlaws target victims indiscriminately, not to acts of robbery against a predetermined or particular victim, even if committed on a highway [11]. Here, there was no proof that the appellants were organized for indiscriminate robbery [10]. As the robbery was proven by the taking of P30.00 and the death occurred by reason or on occasion thereof, the proper offense is Robbery with Homicide [12].

The Decision is MODIFIED. Appellants are found GUILTY of Robbery with Homicide and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* [13].
