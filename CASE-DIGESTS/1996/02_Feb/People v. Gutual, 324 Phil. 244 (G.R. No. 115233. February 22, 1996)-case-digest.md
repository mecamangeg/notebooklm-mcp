I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. WILSON GUTUAL Y REMOLLENA, G.R. No. 115233, February 22, 1996, 324 Phil. 244, Davide, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
On December 29, 1990, in San Vicente, Davao, the victim, Celestino Maglinte, was running amuck and chasing the Barangay Captain with a bolo. Accused-appellant Wilson Gutual and his co-accused Joaquin Nadera, both CAFGU members, responded to the scene and fired warning shots. Maglinte stopped pursuing the Captain and turned his aggression toward Gutual. Gutual retreated until he was pinned against the staircase of the barangay hall. With the victim approximately one meter away and hacking at him, Gutual fired his Garand rifle intending to hit the victim's hand to disarm him, but the bullet pierced Maglinte's chest, killing him. The Regional Trial Court convicted Gutual of Murder, ruling that he could have used close-fighting techniques instead of shooting, but acquitted Nadera.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N accused-appellant Gutual acted in legitimate self-defense and should be acquitted.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that Gutual proved all the elements of self-defense under Article 11, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code: (1) unlawful aggression by the victim; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation. The Court found unlawful aggression manifest as the victim was armed and relentlessly advancing. Regarding the reasonable necessity of means, the Court rejected the lower court's reasoning that Gutual should have used hand-to-hand combat. The Court applied the doctrine of "rational equivalence," stating that in an emergency where one is pinned and facing imminent death, one is not expected to think coolly but to act on the instinct of self-preservation. The necessity of the means does not imply "material commensurability" between the weapon of attack and defense.

The appeal is GRANTED. The decision of the Regional Trial Court is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and accused-appellant Wilson Gutual is ACQUITTED.
