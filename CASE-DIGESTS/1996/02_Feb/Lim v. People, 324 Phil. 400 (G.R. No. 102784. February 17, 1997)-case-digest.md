I. CAPTION
ROSA LIM v. COURT OF APPEALS and PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. 102784, February 17, 1997, 324 Phil. 400, Hermosisima, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
On October 8, 1987, petitioner Rosa Lim received a 3.35-carat diamond ring worth P169,000.00 and a bracelet worth P170,000.00 from private respondent Victoria Suarez. Lim signed a receipt (Exhibit "A") stipulating that the jewelry was received in trust to be sold on commission basis or returned if unsold [1-3]. Lim signed the receipt on the upper portion rather than the bottom space provided for the signature [4, 5].

Lim returned the bracelet but failed to return the ring. She claimed that before departing for Cebu, she called Suarez, who instructed her to give the ring to one Aurelia Nadera for return. Lim allegedly gave the ring to Nadera [6, 7]. Suarez denied giving such authorization, citing that Nadera was indebted to her and was a high risk [8]. The RTC convicted Lim of Estafa under Art. 315, par. 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty [9, 10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the agreement was a contract of agency to sell on commission or a sale on credit given the placement of the petitioner's signature.
2. W/N the petitioner is liable for Estafa under Art. 315, par. 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code.

IV. RULING
1. **NO** (to sale on credit) / **YES** (to agency). The placement of Rosa Lim's signature on the upper portion of the receipt does not alter the nature of the transaction from a contract of agency to sell on commission basis to a contract of sale, nor does it indicate a lack of consent [5]. Under **Article 1356 of the Civil Code**, contracts are obligatory in whatever form they may have been entered into, provided all essential requisites are present [5]. The law only strictly prescribes the location of signatures for notarial wills under **Article 805 of the Civil Code** [11]. By signing, Lim became bound by the stipulations in the receipt [5].

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the factual findings that Suarez did not authorize the turnover of the ring to Nadera [12]. By delivering the ring to Nadera without the express authority and consent of the owner, Lim assumed the right to dispose of the jewelry as if it were hers, thereby committing conversion and breach of trust [13]. All elements of Estafa with abuse of confidence under **Article 315, par. 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code** were present: (1) receipt of property in trust/commission; (2) misappropriation or conversion; and (3) prejudice to the owner [14, 15].

The petition is **DENIED** and the CA decision is **AFFIRMED** [15].
