I. CAPTION
DANNY T. RASONABLE vs. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, JOEY GUEVARRA AND VICTORY LINER, INC., G.R. No. 117195, February 20, 1996, 324 Phil. 191, Puno, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Danny Rasonable filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against Victory Liner. The Labor Arbiter (LA) ruled in his favor, awarding backwages from the date of dismissal up to the date of the LA decision, separation pay of one-half month per year of service, and attorney's fees. On appeal, the NLRC modified the judgment by increasing the separation pay to one month per year of service but deleted the award of attorney's fees. The NLRC also ruled that the award of separation pay severed the employer-employee relationship as of the date of the LA decision; thus, backwages and other benefits should not be computed beyond that date. The Supreme Court previously denied Victory Liner's separate petition, rendering the finding of illegal dismissal final. Rasonable filed this petition challenging the deletion of attorney's fees and the limitation on the computation period of his monetary awards.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioner is entitled to attorney's fees.
2. W/N the computation of backwages and separation pay should extend beyond the Labor Arbiter's decision up to the finality of the Supreme Court decision.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in deleting the attorney's fees. Under Article 2208 of the Civil Code, an employee is entitled to attorney's fees in actions for the recovery of wages or where he is forced to litigate and incur expenses to protect his rights and interests [1].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the employer-employee relationship subsists until the actual receipt of separation pay or the finality of the decision. A mere order for separation pay in lieu of reinstatement does not immediately terminate employment if the award is not actually paid [2]. Citing Article 279 of the Labor Code as amended by R.A. 6715, and returning to the policy prior to the *Mercury Drug* rule, the Court held that backwages (less earnings elsewhere) and separation pay must be computed from the date of dismissal and start of employment, respectively, up to the **finality of the decision** [3].

Petition is **GRANTED**. The NLRC decision is **MODIFIED**. Attorney's fees are reinstated, and the computation of backwages and separation pay is ordered to be updated until the finality of the decision.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
