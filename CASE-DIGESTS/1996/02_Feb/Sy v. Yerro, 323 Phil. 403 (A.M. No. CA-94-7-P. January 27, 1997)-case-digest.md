I. CAPTION
CLEMENTE SY v. JAIME B. YERRO, A.M. No. CA-94-7-P, January 27, 1997, 323 Phil. 403, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
Complainant Clemente Sy, a tenant and president of the tenants' association at House International Building, filed a complaint for grave misconduct and dishonesty against Respondent Jaime B. Yerro, a Records Officer I at the Court of Appeals. On November 25, 1993, Respondent appeared at the building misrepresenting himself as a sheriff and actively assisted in implementing a writ of execution issued by the RTC of Manila. Witnesses testified that Respondent kicked doors, hurled invectives at tenants, and threatened them with eviction [1, 2]. Verification revealed that while Respondent was a regular court employee, he was officially absent or on "sick leave" during the dates he participated in the eviction (November 25 and December 2, 1993) [3]. Respondent denied the allegations, claiming he was merely present to meet a lawyer, but he was positively identified by the sheriff, police, and barangay officials [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent is liable for dishonesty and grave misconduct for interfering in the implementation of a writ while on sick leave.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court found Respondent guilty of dishonesty and grave misconduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. Despite his denial, positive identification by witnesses and photographic evidence established that he actively participated in the eviction [4]. The Court held that applying for a sick leave for a prolonged period when he was, in fact, physically performing other activities (assisting in an eviction) constitutes **dishonesty** [5].

Furthermore, Respondent's act of deliberately misrepresenting himself as a sheriff and interfering in the proceedings of another court constitutes a clear case of intervention and **grave misconduct**. The Court emphasized that the conduct of everyone connected with the dispensation of justice must be beyond reproach and circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility [6].

Accordingly, Respondent was DISMISSED from the service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and with prejudice to reemployment in any government office [6].
