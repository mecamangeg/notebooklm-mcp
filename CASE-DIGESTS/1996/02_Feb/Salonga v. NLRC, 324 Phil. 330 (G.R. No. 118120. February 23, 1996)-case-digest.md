I. CAPTION
JAIME SALONGA, ET AL. v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, NEWFOUNDLAND PAPER PRODUCTS, INC. (NOW LUMINAIRE PRINTING & PUBLISHING CORP.), ET AL., G.R. No. 118120, February 23, 1996, 324 Phil. 330, Panganiban, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioners filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against private respondent Newfoundland Paper Products, Inc., claiming they were deceived into accepting separation pay and signing quitclaims after management announced a closure due to heavy losses, only for the company to reopen using new employees [2]. The respondents moved to dismiss based on the quitclaims, but the Labor Arbiter dispensed with a hearing and decided the case on the pleadings, ruling in favor of the petitioners and awarding reinstatement and backwages [3]. On appeal, the NLRC reversed the decision and remanded the case for a "full-blown trial," holding that the Labor Arbiter erred in deciding without a hearing [3]. The Solicitor General supported the petitioners, arguing that a remand would serve no useful purpose and cause undue delay [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Labor Arbiter erred in deciding the case based on position papers without a formal trial.
2. W/N the petitioners are barred from claiming illegal dismissal due to the execution of quitclaims and acceptance of separation pay.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The holding of a trial is discretionary on the Labor Arbiter and cannot be demanded as a matter of right by the parties [5]. Due process requirements are satisfied where the parties are given the opportunity to submit position papers, and the Labor Arbiter has the authority to decide based on these documents without resorting to technical rules of evidence [5]. The Court found that the Labor Arbiter did not exercise this discretion imprudently [6].

2. **NO.** Quitclaims executed by employees are not sufficient to show valid terminations, and the burden rests on the employer to prove that such quitclaims were voluntary [7]. Under prevailing jurisprudence, a deed of release or quitclaim does not bar an employee from demanding benefits to which they are legally entitled, nor does the acceptance of separation pay amount to estoppel against contesting the legality of a dismissal [7]. The employer failed to discharge its burden of proving the alleged heavy business losses under Article 283 of the Labor Code to justify the termination [8].

The NLRC Resolution is SET ASIDE and the decision of the Labor Arbiter is REINSTATED and AFFIRMED [6].
