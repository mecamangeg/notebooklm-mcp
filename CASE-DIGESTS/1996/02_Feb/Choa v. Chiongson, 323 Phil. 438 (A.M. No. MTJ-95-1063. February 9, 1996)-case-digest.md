I. CAPTION
ALFONSO C. CHOA v. JUDGE ROBERTO S. CHIONGSON, A.M. No. MTJ-95-1063, February 9, 1996, 323 Phil. 438, Davide, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Alfonso C. Choa was charged with Perjury in Criminal Case No. 50322, presided over by Respondent Judge Roberto S. Chiongson. The information alleged that Choa made false statements in his verified Petition for Naturalization regarding his residence and moral character. Specifically, Choa claimed to reside with his wife and children and to be of good moral character, when in fact he had been separated from his wife since 1984 and was cohabiting with another woman. Judge Chiongson convicted Choa of perjury and sentenced him to six months and one day of *prision correccional*. Choa moved for reconsideration, arguing that his withdrawal of the naturalization petition rendered it *functus officio* and that the allegations therein were privileged. After the motion was denied, Choa filed this administrative complaint, alleging grave misconduct and gross bias. Choa claimed the Judge failed to disqualify himself despite being a "next-door neighbor" to Choa's estranged wife and erred in applying the law.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Respondent Judge is administratively liable for failing to disqualify himself on the ground of being a neighbor to a party.
2. W/N the withdrawal of a petition for naturalization extinguishes the criminal liability for perjury committed therein.
3. W/N the Indeterminate Sentence Law applies to a penalty of six months and one day.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that being a neighbor to a party-litigant is not a ground for mandatory or voluntary disqualification under Section 1, Rule 137 of the Rules of Court. Furthermore, the complainant failed to raise this issue prior to the rendition of the judgment or in his motion for reconsideration, precluding him from raising it in an administrative complaint.

2. **NO.** The withdrawal of the Petition for Naturalization does not amount to a recall of the untruthful statements made under oath, nor does it extinguish the offense of perjury. Citing *People v. Cainglet*, the Court held that public policy demands perjury not be shielded by technicalities. The petition was required by law (Com. Act No. 473) and the falsehoods regarding residence and moral character were material matters willfully asserted. The withdrawal rendered the petition *functus officio* only for the special proceedings, not for use as evidence in the criminal case.

3. **NO.** The Court upheld the non-application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law. Section 2 of R.A. No. 4103 explicitly states that the Act does not apply to those whose maximum term of imprisonment does not exceed one year. Since the penalty imposed was six months and one day, which does not exceed one year, the Judge correctly imposed a straight penalty.

The administrative complaint is **DISMISSED** for want of merit.
