I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PERCIVAL GECOMO Y OSIT, G.R. Nos. 115035-36, February 23, 1996, 324 Phil. 297, Regalado, J.

II. FACTS
Accused-appellant Percival Gecomo and complainant Regina Rapuzon were co-employees at a restaurant in Manila. On June 20, 1992, while Rapuzon was walking to work, Gecomo accosted her, poked a knife at her side, and forced her to a hotel where he raped her twice after threatening to kill her. On July 3, 1992, after Rapuzon resigned from work, Gecomo intercepted her again at knifepoint, took her to his house, slapped her, and raped her twice. He tied her to the bed post between the acts. Rapuzon reported the incidents to her mother and the police the following day.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila convicted Gecomo of two crimes of rape, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* and ordering indemnification of P50,000 in each case. Gecomo appealed, arguing that the judge who rendered the decision (Judge Fortun) was not the one who presided over the trial, and raised the defense that he and the complainant were sweethearts and the acts were consensual.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court judge validly rendered the decision despite not having presided over the trial.
2. W/N the guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the fact that the judge who decided the case did not hear the trial does not render the decision erroneous or irregular. It is axiomatic that a judge who did not hear a case may write the decision therein based on the records thereof [1, 2]. In this case, the transcripts of stenographic notes were complete and assumed to have been studied by the judge under the presumption of regularity [3].

2. **YES.** The Court found the complainant’s testimony credible and consistent [4]. The delay in reporting the first incident and her failure to shout for help were sufficiently explained by the death threats made by the accused and the sheer fear she felt [5, 6]. The Court rejected the "sweetheart theory" as the pictures presented showed no intimacy, and the accused's testimony regarding dates was inconsistent and contradictory [7, 8]. Furthermore, even if a relationship existed, it does not negate rape if force or intimidation was used [9]. Rape can be committed even in places where people congregate or inside a house with other occupants [10].

The appealed judgment of the trial court is **AFFIRMED** *in toto*.
