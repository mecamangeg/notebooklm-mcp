I. CAPTION
WILLIAM L. TIU v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND HERMES DELA CRUZ, G.R. No. 95845, February 21, 1996, 324 Phil. 202, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner William L. Tiu, operator of D'Rough Riders Transportation, was sued by private respondent Hermes Dela Cruz for illegal dismissal and money claims on February 18, 1986 [1]. Dela Cruz worked as a "dispatcher" in Tiu's terminals, assisting passengers [2]. Tiu denied the existence of an employer-employee relationship, claiming Dela Cruz was merely one of the "standbys" he allowed to hang around the terminal to avoid trouble with "bad elements," and that Dela Cruz was actually selected and supervised by Regino dela Cruz, the "Chief Dispatcher" [2, 3]. The Labor Arbiter found Dela Cruz was a regular employee, citing the payment of a fixed daily wage of P20.00 and Tiu's power to dismiss him as evidenced by a disciplinary memorandum [4, 5]. The NLRC affirmed the Labor Arbiter's decision in *toto* [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an employer-employee relationship exists between petitioner Tiu and private respondent Dela Cruz.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the existence of an employer-employee relationship based on the "control test," which determines the relationship by the employer's reserved right to direct the end and means of the work [6]. The evidence showed Tiu exercised the power of control, selection, and dismissal [3, 6]. Tiu's argument that Regino dela Cruz (Chief Dispatcher) was the independent employer is untenable because Regino was merely Tiu's employee/supervisor who hired and disciplined workers based on Tiu's instructions [7].

Furthermore, even if Regino were considered a contractor, he would only be a "labor-only" contractor under Article 106 of the Labor Code because he lacked substantial capital or investment in the business [8]. A labor-only contractor is considered a mere agent of the employer; thus, Tiu remains responsible to Dela Cruz as if he were directly employed [8].

The petition is DENIED for lack of merit [9].
