I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SANTOS CANADA, G.R. No. 112176, February 6, 1996, 323 Phil. 340, Bellosillo, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On December 26, 1990, 12-year-old Loberiza Palaming attended a public dance in Castilla, Sorsogon. While sitting near the entrance, she was suddenly grabbed from behind by the accused, Santos Canada, and dragged to a sampaloc tree ten meters away. Canada tied her hands, gagged her, and threatened her with a gun before raping her. Afterwards, Loberiza managed to box him before he fled. The trial court convicted Canada of rape and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*. Canada appealed, arguing that the victim's testimony was riddled with inconsistencies regarding the details of the assault and her companions, that she may have mistaken his identity, and that he had an alibi placing him at home two kilometers away [3-6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused is guilty of rape beyond reasonable doubt despite the alleged inconsistencies in the victim's testimony and his defense of alibi.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court held that the alleged inconsistencies in the victim's sworn statement versus her court testimony were minor and did not impair her credibility. Ex-parte affidavits are generally incomplete, and a 12-year-old's failure to mention specific details like being tied or gagged in an affidavit is attributed to the nature of questioning and her naivete [4].

The Court ruled that full credence is accorded to the testimony of a rape victim who has no ill motive to testify falsely [5]. The victim positively identified Canada, as the scene was illuminated by lamps 30 meters away [5]. Regarding the medical evidence, the Court reiterated that the absence of spermatozoa does not negate rape, as sperm has a limited lifespan and the exam occurred five days later; the presence of hymenal lacerations corroborated the assault [7]. Furthermore, the force or intimidation need not be irresistible, only sufficient to achieve the accused's purpose [8].

Finally, the defense of alibi was rejected because it was corroborated only by the accused's father and it was not physically impossible for him to be at the crime scene, which was only a 30-minute walk from his house [6]. Alibi is the weakest defense and cannot prevail over positive identification [9].

The decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED [4].
