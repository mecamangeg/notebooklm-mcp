I. CAPTION
LEOVIGILDO U. MANTARING v. JUDGE MANUEL A. ROMAN, JR. and JUDGE IRENEO B. MOLATO, A.M. No. RTJ-93-964, February 28, 1996, 324 Phil. 387, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Leovigildo Mantaring filed an administrative complaint against Respondent Judge Molato. While this was pending, Molato conducted a preliminary investigation for Illegal Possession of Firearms against one Joel Gamo, the complainant, and his son [1, 2]. The charges stemmed from a search warrant issued against Gamo, which yielded firearms in a house owned by Mantaring [2]. Despite the pending administrative case against him filed by Mantaring, Molato took cognizance of the criminal case, found probable cause, and issued warrants of arrest against Mantaring and his son [1, 2]. Mantaring filed a Supplemental Complaint charging Molato with harassment, arguing Molato should have inhibited himself due to the prior administrative case [1]. Molato claimed he eventually inhibited himself when ordered by the Executive Judge and justified the arrest warrant based on probable cause [2]. The Office of the Court Administrator recommended dismissal [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Respondent Judge should have inhibited himself from conducting the preliminary investigation.
2. W/N the issuance of the warrant of arrest was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Respondent Judge should have inhibited himself. While the mere filing of an administrative case does not automatically disqualify a judge, in this case, the administrative complaint was filed *prior* to the criminal case [4, 5]. This sequence created the impression that the Judge’s actions were dictated by a spirit of revenge, compromising the "cold neutrality of an impartial judge" [5]. Prudence required him to inhibit to avoid even the slightest suspicion of bias or improbity and to maintain the appearance of fairness [6].

2. **NO.** The issuance of the warrant was improper. In preliminary investigations, a judge must determine not only the existence of probable cause but also the necessity of placing the respondent under immediate custody to prevent the frustration of justice [7, 8]. Respondent Judge admitted he issued the warrant solely on his finding of probable cause, totally omitting the third requirement regarding the frustration of the ends of justice [9].

**ACCORDINGLY**, Respondent Judge Ireneo B. Molato is **REPRIMANDED** and **WARNED** [10].
