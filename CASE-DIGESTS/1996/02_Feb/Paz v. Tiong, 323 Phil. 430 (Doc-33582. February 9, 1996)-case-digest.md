I. CAPTION
JUDGE SEGUNDO B. PAZ v. JUDGE ANTONIO V. TIONG, A.M. No. MTJ-94-998, February 9, 1996, 323 Phil. 430, Melo, J.

II. FACTS
Judge Paz, presiding over the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Alaminos, Pangasinan, had a pending criminal case for illegal possession of firearms against accused Ernesto Tugade [1, 2]. A motion for bail was filed on August 10, 1994, and set for hearing on August 16, 1994 [2]. However, on August 15, 1994—one day before the scheduled hearing—Respondent Judge Tiong, presiding over the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Bolinao, approved the bail bond and issued an Order of Release for the accused [3, 4]. Judge Paz discovered this irregularity when the accused's wife presented Judge Tiong's order after the RTC had already granted bail during the scheduled hearing [3]. Judge Tiong admitted signing the order but claimed he was in severe pain and on sick leave at the time, and acted under the mistaken belief that the RTC had already granted bail [5, 6]. He further argued that his order was not actually used to release the accused [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent Judge Tiong had the authority to approve the bail bond and issue a release order for a case pending in the RTC.

IV. RULING
**NO.** Respondent Judge Tiong had no authority to approve the bail bond. The Supreme Court held that he disregarded Section 14, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court, which mandates that bail be filed with the court where the case is pending [4, 8]. Since the case was pending before the RTC in Alaminos, only that court could approve the bond, unless the judge thereof was unavailable or the accused was arrested in a different province, neither of which was shown in the records [7]. The Court rejected Respondent's defense that the order was not utilized, stating it was immaterial to the charge of approving the bond without authority [7]. Furthermore, the Court noted that his excuse of being on sick leave made matters worse, as he had no authority to discharge judicial duties while on leave [9].

Respondent Judge Antonio V. Tiong is found guilty of abuse of authority and ordered to pay a fine of P3,000.00 [10].
