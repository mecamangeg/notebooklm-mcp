I. CAPTION
ISMAEL SAMSON v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND ATLANTIC GULF AND PACIFIC CO., MANILA, INC., G.R. No. 113166, February 1, 1996, 323 Phil. 135, Regalado, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ismael Samson worked for respondent Atlantic Gulf and Pacific Co. (AG & P) as a rigger and foreman for approximately 28 years, starting in April 1965 [1, 2]. He was assigned to various local and overseas projects, often being rehired immediately with gaps of only one day to one week between projects [3, 4]. AG & P did not report the termination of his supposed project employments to the Public Employment Office [5, 6].

On November 5, 1989, Samson filed a complaint for regularization [1]. The Labor Arbiter ruled in his favor, citing AG & P's failure to report project terminations as required by Policy Instruction No. 20 [5]. The NLRC reversed this ruling, holding that Samson was a project employee. The NLRC applied Department Order No. 19 (Series of 1993) retroactively, reasoning that the new rule superseded Policy Instruction No. 20 and no longer considered the failure to report termination as determinative of regular status [7]. AG & P also argued the petition should be dismissed because Samson failed to file a Motion for Reconsideration with the NLRC before elevating the case [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies (filing a Motion for Reconsideration).
2. W/N the petitioner is a regular employee.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The failure to file a Motion for Reconsideration is not fatal. The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is not absolute and does not apply when the issue raised is purely legal [9]. Furthermore, procedural lapses may be disregarded in the interest of substantial justice, particularly to protect the rights of workers [9].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that Samson is a regular employee based on two main grounds:

First, Department Order No. 19 cannot be applied retroactively to the prejudice of the worker [6]. During Samson's employment, Policy Instruction No. 20 was in force, which required employers to report the termination of project employees to the Public Employment Office [10]. AG & P's failure to comply with this requirement is a clear indication that Samson was not a project employee [6].

Second, under Article 280 of the Labor Code (cited as Art. 281 in the text), an employee is deemed regular if engaged to perform activities usually necessary or desirable in the usual business of the employer [11]. Samson’s 28 years of service, performing the same tasks as a rigger, and his repeated rehiring with insignificant gaps (1 day to 1 week) demonstrate the necessity and indispensability of his services to AG & P [2, 4]. Such "project-to-project" arrangements calculated to preclude tenurial security are contrary to public policy [4].

The NLRC decision is **REVERSED** and SET ASIDE, and the Labor Arbiter's decision is **REINSTATED** [12].
