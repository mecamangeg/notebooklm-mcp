I. CAPTION
MAURICE C. FLORES v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION and PREMIERE DEVELOPMENT BANK, G.R. No. 116419, February 9, 1996, 323 Phil. 589, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Maurice C. Flores was employed by respondent Premiere Development Bank as a loan processor on a probationary status for six months. Her performance was evaluated monthly, yielding results such as "shy," "soft-spoken," and "ineffective in terms of communication." In mid-August 1992, she was assigned as a Department Secretary, but her evaluation still noted a need to improve appearance and spelling. On September 23, 1992, the Bank notified Flores that her probationary employment was terminated for failure to meet reasonable standards.

Flores filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. The Labor Arbiter ruled in her favor, ordering reinstatement on the ground that she had become a regular employee. The NLRC reversed the Arbiter’s decision and declared the termination valid. Flores filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, alleging she attained regular status because the nature of her work was necessary to the business and claiming she was allowed to work beyond the probationary period based on her attendance records.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in ruling that the petitioner failed to attain regular employment status.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court upheld the NLRC's findings, noting that a Rule 65 petition is limited to correcting errors of jurisdiction and does not cover the re-evaluation of evidence [1, 2].

The Court rejected the Labor Arbiter's conclusion that Flores was a regular employee. First, the nature of her functions as a loan processor or secretary did not *ipso facto* make her a regular employee [3]. Second, her claim of working beyond the probationary period was devoid of factual basis. The Court found that the attendance records she submitted (Annexes "F" and "F-1") had been altered to obscure the fact that she did not work on September 23, 1992, the date her probationary employment was terminated [3, 4]. Since the NLRC’s findings were supported by substantial evidence and no grave abuse of discretion was shown, the petition was **DISMISSED** [5].
