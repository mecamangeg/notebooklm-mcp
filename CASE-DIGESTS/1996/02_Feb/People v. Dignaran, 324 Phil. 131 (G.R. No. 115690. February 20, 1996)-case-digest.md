I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. REY SALISON, JR., G.R. No. 115690, February 20, 1996, 324 Phil. 131, Regalado, J.

II. FACTS
On November 30, 1990, at around 8:00 P.M. in Davao City, accused-appellant Rey Salison, Jr. approached the victim, Rolando Valmoria, and brought him behind a neighbor's house where he boxed him in the abdomen [1]. Three co-accused (Andiente, Dignaran, and Fediles) suddenly appeared and joined the assault [1]. Although a witness briefly separated them, the four accused pursued Valmoria, hitting him on the back and head with pieces of wood [2]. Valmoria managed to run into his house, but the accused continued to hit the walls. Shortly after, Valmoria complained of dizziness and head pain. Believing he would die, he went to the purok leader, Patricia Alcoseba, and dictated a statement identifying the four accused as his assailants, which he signed [3-5]. Valmoria died on December 4, 1990, due to subdular hemorrhage caused by blunt external trauma [6, 7].

Salison was charged with Murder. The Regional Trial Court convicted him, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* and ordering him to pay damages [8, 9]. Salison appealed, claiming denial and alibi, arguing he only tried to pacify a fight between the victim and a co-accused, and challenging the admissibility of the dying declaration [10-12].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the written statement of the victim is admissible as a dying declaration or part of the *res gestae*.
2. W/N conspiracy existed among the accused.
3. W/N the crime committed is Murder qualified by abuse of superior strength.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled the statement admissible as a dying declaration because it was made under the consciousness of impending death. The victim was in great pain and explicitly stated his belief that he would die [13]. Even assuming it did not qualify as a dying declaration, it is admissible as part of the *res gestae*, having been made shortly after a startling occurrence when the victim had no opportunity to contrive [13]. Furthermore, the defense waived any objection regarding the lack of translation by failing to object during trial [14].

2. **YES.** Conspiracy was established by the simultaneous attacks and the manner in which the killing was executed, indicating a common intent and concerted action [15, 16]. Direct proof of a prior agreement is not essential; it is sufficient that the accused acted in concert to fulfill a common purpose [16]. Thus, the act of one is the act of all [17].

3. **YES.** The killing was qualified by abuse of superior strength. The four accused, armed with big pieces of wood, mercilessly bludgeoned the unarmed and defenseless victim [18]. The number of assailants and the nature of the weapons created a notorious inequality of force advantageous to the accused [18].

The decision of the Regional Trial Court is **AFFIRMED** *in toto* [19].
