I. CAPTION
CATALINA BUAN VDA. DE ESCONDE, CONSTANCIA ESCONDE VDA. DE PERALTA, ELENITA ESCONDE AND BENJAMIN ESCONDE v. HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS AND PEDRO ESCONDE, G.R. No. 103635, February 1, 1996, 323 Phil. 81, Romero, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Constancia, Benjamin, Elenita, and their mother Catalina are the siblings and mother, respectively, of private respondent Pedro Esconde. On December 5, 1946, the heirs of Eulogio Esconde executed a deed of extrajudicial partition involving the estate of Estanislao Esconde. Catalina, representing her minor children (except Constancia), waived her usufructuary rights. In said deed, Lot No. 1700 was adjudicated exclusively to Pedro [1-3]. TCT No. 394 was issued in Pedro's name on February 11, 1947 [4].

In 1982, Benjamin discovered the lot was registered solely to Pedro and demanded his share, but Pedro asserted exclusive ownership. Consequently, on June 29, 1987—forty years after registration—petitioners filed a complaint for annulment of title and partition [5]. The Regional Trial Court dismissed the complaint, ruling that while a trust was created under Article 1456 due to the mistake/fraud in the partition, the action was barred by prescription and laches [6-8]. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the action for reconveyance based on implied trust prescribes in 10 years from registration [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners' action for reconveyance based on an implied trust is barred by prescription and laches.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed that the action is barred. The Court held that the mistake in allotting the entirety of Lot No. 1700 to Pedro created a **constructive implied trust** under Article 1456 of the Civil Code, not a resulting trust, as Pedro never intended to hold the property for the others [10].

Unlike express or resulting trusts, **repudiation is not required** for prescription to run in constructive trusts [11]. Under Section 40 of Act No. 190 (applicable since the cause of action accrued in 1947), the action prescribes in ten (10) years [12]. Citing *Heirs of Jose Olviga v. CA*, the Court ruled that the ten-year prescriptive period is counted from the date of registration of the property when the plaintiff is **not in possession** of the contested property. Here, Pedro, not the petitioners, was in possession [12]. Since the title was registered on February 11, 1947, and the complaint was filed only on June 29, 1987, the action had long prescribed. Furthermore, the doctrine of laches applies to constructive trusts where the beneficiary fails to assert their rights for an unreasonable time [13].

The petition is **DENIED** and the decision **AFFIRMED**, with the modification that private respondent shall indemnify petitioner Benjamin Esconde for expenses incurred for improvements on Lot No. 1700 [14].
