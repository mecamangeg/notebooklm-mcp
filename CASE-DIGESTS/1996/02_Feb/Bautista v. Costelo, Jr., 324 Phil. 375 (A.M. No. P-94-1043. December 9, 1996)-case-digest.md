I. CAPTION
CLERK OF COURT ARTURO Q. BAUTISTA v. DEPUTY SHERIFF MARGARITO C. COSTELO, JR., A.M. No. P-94-1043, December 9, 1996, 324 Phil. 375, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Clerk of Court charged Respondent Deputy Sheriff with malversation, insubordination, grave misconduct, and violation of Supreme Court Circular No. 3-92, which prohibits using Halls of Justice for residential or commercial purposes. The charges alleged that Respondent used government materials to build a house, appropriated coconuts from court grounds, resided in the courthouse, and raised livestock on the premises. The Investigating Judge recommended dismissal, finding the charges baseless and the product of animosity. The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) recommended a reprimand. The record showed Respondent lived in the Bachelor Officers’ Quarters (BOQ) upon the invitation of the presiding Judge, not in the courthouse itself. However, Respondent admitted to raising turkeys and goats within the court grounds, though he removed them upon the Complainant's directive.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent violated Supreme Court Circular No. 3-92 regarding the proper use of judicial premises.

IV. RULING
**YES.** While the Court dismissed the charges of malversation, insubordination, and residing in the courthouse (finding that the BOQ was a separate structure designed for living), it found Respondent liable for raising livestock. The prohibition in Circular No. 3-92 against using Halls of Justice for residential or commercial purposes extends to their immediate vicinity and grounds. Acts tending to degrade courts are not excused simply because they are not committed strictly "within" the building. Raising livestock (turkeys and goats) within the premises degrades the dignity of the court. As held in *Kelly Austria v. Judge Singuat Guerra*, Halls of Justice are "temples of justice" that must be kept undefiled.

Respondent is **ADMONISHED** and **WARNED** that a repetition of the act will be dealt with more severely.
