I. CAPTION
SALVADOR P. SOCRATES v. SANDIGANBAYAN, THIRD DIVISION, AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. Nos. 116259-60 (consolidated with G.R. Nos. 118896-97), February 20, 1996, 324 Phil. 151, Regalado, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Salvador Socrates, Governor of Palawan, was charged with violations of Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) based on complaints filed in 1986. During the preliminary investigation, petitioner filed various pleadings, including a Motion to Suspend Preliminary Investigation in 1987 and a motion to dismiss/quash in 1991, which delayed the proceedings [1-4]. In 1992, the Ombudsman finally filed two informations with the Sandiganbayan: one for violation of Section 3(h) regarding a contract with ERA Technology (where petitioner was a board member), and another for violation of Section 3(e) regarding the purchase of a defective motor launch [5, 6].

Petitioner moved to quash the informations, arguing that the six-year delay in the preliminary investigation violated his right to a speedy disposition of cases under the *Tatad* doctrine [7]. The Sandiganbayan denied the motion [8]. Subsequently, the court ordered petitioner's preventive suspension for 90 days [9]. Petitioner filed consolidated petitions for certiorari and prohibition challenging the validity of the informations and the constitutionality of the suspension order under Section 13 of R.A. 3019 [10, 11].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the six-year delay in the preliminary investigation violated petitioner's right to speedy disposition of cases.
2. W/N the informations are valid despite the non-inclusion of co-principals (Sanggunian members and ERA directors).
3. W/N Section 13 of R.A. 3019 is constitutional and the preventive suspension order valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The delay was not a violation of constitutional rights because it was caused by petitioner's own acts. Unlike in *Tatad v. Sandiganbayan*, where the delay was unexplained and politically motivated, the delay here resulted from petitioner's "obviously delaying tactics," such as filing motions to suspend and dismiss the investigation [1, 12]. A speedy trial is one free from vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays; here, the petitioner brought about the situation he complained of [13].

2. **YES.** The informations are valid. The prosecutor has the discretion to determine who to charge, and the failure to include other responsible persons does not vitiate the validity of the information against the accused [14, 15]. Furthermore, petitioner waived this ground by failing to raise it before arraignment [16]. Substantively, the ERA directors could not be charged under Section 3(h) (which requires public office) but rather Section 4(b), which was not alleged; and the Sanggunian members merely authorized the purchase resolution, while the charge involved the implementation of said purchase [17, 18].

3. **YES.** Section 13 is constitutional and the suspension order is valid. The power to suspend is incidental to the power of removal and is properly lodged with the court [19, 20]. Under Section 13 of R.A. 3019, suspension is mandatory once the court determines the validity of the information in a pre-suspension hearing [21]. It is not a penalty but a preventive measure to protect public interest [22]. The court has no discretion to hold the suspension in abeyance pending review of the denial of a motion to quash [21].

The petitions are **DISMISSED** [23].
