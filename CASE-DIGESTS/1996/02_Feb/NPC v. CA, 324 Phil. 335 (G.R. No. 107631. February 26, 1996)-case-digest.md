**I. CAPTION**
**NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS AND PECORP, INC. (FORMERLY PACIFIC EQUIPMENT CORP.)**, G.R. No. 107631, February 26, 1996, 324 Phil. 335, Francisco, J.

**II. FACTS**
On June 27, 1974, Petitioner National Power Corporation (NPC) and Private Respondent PECORP, Inc. entered into a "Cost-Plus a Percentage" contract for the construction of the Mariveles Dam No. 1 [1, 2]. Under this agreement, PECORP was to be paid a fee based on the "Actual Final Cost" of the work [2]. Subsequently, NPC contracted directly with a third party, GROGUN, for the drilling and grouting portion of the project, claiming it had the right to withdraw this work under Article 1725 of the Civil Code, and thus refused to pay PECORP fees for it [3, 4].

In 1979, PECORP presented four claims to NPC for arbitration, including fees for the drilling and grouting work and fees on minimum guaranteed equipment rentals [5]. NPC refused to arbitrate these two claims, arguing the drilling work was validly withdrawn and the equipment rental claim had been waived by PECORP in a 1980 letter [5, 6]. PECORP filed an action to compel arbitration. The Regional Trial Court ruled in favor of PECORP, ordering arbitration for all four claims [7]. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed, holding that the drilling work was part of the project scope and the waiver of the rental claim was conditional and thus void [8, 9]. NPC petitioned the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the claims for drilling/grouting fees and equipment rentals are arbitrable under the contract.
2. W/N NPC validly withdrew the drilling/grouting work under Article 1725 of the Civil Code to preclude PECORP’s fee claim.
3. W/N PECORP validly withdrew its claim for equipment rental fees.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The parties are bound by the arbitration clause in their contract. Article VI of the agreement stipulates that "any dispute, controversy, or differences between the parties arising out of this contract" shall be submitted for arbitration [10]. The Court held that since the four claims, including the disputed ones, directly and exclusively emanate from the contract, they are arbitrable without qualification as to the nature of the dispute [11, 12].

2. **NO.** The Court affirmed the CA's ruling that Article 1725 of the Civil Code is inapplicable [13]. Article 1725 allows an owner to withdraw from the "construction of the work," but in this case, there was no actual withdrawal from the project construction, but merely a transfer of a specific part (drilling and grouting) to another contractor [14]. Since the contract was for the "complete" construction of the dam, and drilling/grouting is an integral part of that project, PECORP remains entitled to the 10% fee under the "cost plus" provision [15, 16].

3. **NO.** The Court upheld the finding that PECORP's letter withdrawing the equipment rental claim was conditional [13]. The text of the letter stated the withdrawal was made with the understanding that the rest of PECORP's claims would be "favorably adjudicated" [17]. Since NPC refused to certify the other claims, the condition was not met, rendering the withdrawal null and void [18].

The petition is **DENIED** and the decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED** [19].
