**I. CAPTION**
REYNALDO HALIMAO v. ATTYS. DANIEL VILLANUEVA AND INOCENCIO PEFIANCO FERRER, JR., A.C. No. 3825, December 16, 1996, 323 Phil. 1, Mendoza, J.

**II. FACTS**
Complainant Reynaldo Halimao, a caretaker of the Oo Kian Tiok Compound in Cainta, Rizal, filed a disbarment complaint against respondents Attys. Villanueva and Ferrer. Halimao alleged that on April 4, 1992, respondents, armed with high-powered weapons, forcibly entered the compound [1]. Respondents argued the complaint was a duplication of A.C. No. 3835 filed by Danilo Hernandez, a security guard at the same compound, regarding the same incident. The Supreme Court had already dismissed Hernandez's complaint for lack of merit on August 5, 1992 [2].

The case was referred to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP). The IBP Board of Governors dismissed the case, adopting the Investigating Commissioner's report which found the complaint barred by the decision in A.C. No. 3835 due to *res judicata* [3]. The Commissioner noted that while the complainants were different, they represented the same interest as co-workers complaining of the same act [4]. Halimao filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that by filing a motion to dismiss, respondents hypothetically admitted the material allegations of serious misconduct [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the complaint is barred by *res judicata* given the dismissal of the prior administrative case (A.C. No. 3835).
2. W/N the respondents’ motion to dismiss constituted a hypothetical admission of the charge of serious misconduct.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the dismissal of the prior case is conclusive in the present case. Although the complainant in the first case (Hernandez) is different from the complainant in this case (Halimao), they have an "identity of interest." Both were employed at the compound during the incident and complained of the same alleged acts by the respondents [6]. Absolute identity of parties is not required for *res judicata* to apply; substantial identity of interests suffices [7]. The Court previously found a "want of a prima facie showing of professional misconduct" regarding the same incident in A.C. No. 3835, which bars the present action [6].

2. **NO.** The rule that a motion to dismiss constitutes a hypothetical admission of facts applies primarily when the ground for dismissal is a failure to state a cause of action [8]. It does not unqualifiedly apply when the motion is based on grounds such as *res judicata*, lack of jurisdiction, or litis pendentia [9]. In such cases, the admission is limited only to facts necessary to resolve the preliminary ground (e.g., that a prior final judgment exists), not the substantive allegations of the offense [9].

Accordingly, the resolution of the IBP Board of Governors is AFFIRMED and the complaint is DISMISSED [10].
