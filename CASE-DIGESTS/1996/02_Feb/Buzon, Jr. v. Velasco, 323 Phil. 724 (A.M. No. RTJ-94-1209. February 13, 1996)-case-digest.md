I. CAPTION
REYMUALDO BUZON, JR. v. JUDGE TIRSO D.C. VELASCO, A.M. No. RTJ-94-1209, February 13, 1996, 323 Phil. 724, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Reymualdo Buzon, Jr. charged Respondent Judge Tirso D.C. Velasco (RTC Quezon City, Branch 88) with gross ignorance of the law and gross partiality regarding *People v. Fernando Tan* (Criminal Case No. Q-89-1707) for Murder [1]. An Information for Murder was filed against the accused; the original warrant issued stated "No Bail Recommended" [2, 3]. However, the Information was tampered with: the word "No" was snowpaked and replaced with "BAIL RECOMMENDED: P50,000.00" [4]. Based on this altered recommendation by the prosecutor, Respondent Judge granted bail to the accused without conducting a hearing [5]. The prosecution filed a Motion to Cancel Bail Bond, arguing that Murder is punishable by *Reclusion Perpetua* and bail is not a matter of right, but the Judge denied the motion, ruling that the bail was in accord with the prosecutor's recommendation and Section 11, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court [4, 6-8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent Judge is guilty of gross ignorance of the law for granting bail in a capital offense without a hearing.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the Respondent Judge is guilty of gross ignorance of the law. Under Section 3, Rule 114 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, bail is not a matter of right for persons charged with capital offenses or offenses punishable by *Reclusion Perpetua* when evidence of guilt is strong [9]. The Court emphasized that a hearing is absolutely indispensable before a judge can grant bail in such cases to determine whether the evidence of guilt is strong [10, 11]. The prosecution must be afforded procedural due process to present evidence and witnesses [12, 13].

The Respondent Judge's reliance on the prosecutor's recommendation or certification of probable cause was misplaced. A judge cannot base the grant of bail merely on affidavits or recommendations intended for the issuance of an arrest warrant [14, 15]. Failure to conduct a hearing is inexcusable and reflects gross ignorance of the law [16].

ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds respondent Judge GUILTY of IGNORANCE OF THE LAW and imposes a FINE of P20,000.00, with a STERN WARNING [17, 18].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Davide, Jr., Kapunan, and Mendoza, JJ., took no part due to close relations to a party [18].
