**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FLORENCIO DEL PRADO, G.R. No. 111708, February 20, 1996, 324 Phil. 99, Romero, J.

**II. FACTS**
On November 16, 1989, 17-year-old Leonora Patillas was biking in Navotas when the accused-appellant, Florencio del Prado, jumped onto the rear of her bicycle. Poking a fan knife at her waist, he forced her to a dark, vacant lot covered in cogon grass. When she refused his order to undress, Del Prado hit her stomach and thighs, immobilizing her. He then stripped her and raped her while threatening to kill her and her family if she reported the incident. Leonora eventually confided in her sister in December 1989, and her mother learned of the rape in March 1990, leading to the filing of the complaint.

Del Prado admitted to having sexual intercourse with Leonora but claimed it was consensual as they were "sweethearts." He alleged they had sex on November 19, 1989, after watching a movie, and claimed the rape charge was a fabrication by Leonora's brother-in-law to extort P30,000.00. The Regional Trial Court of Kalookan City, Branch 124, gave credence to the prosecution's evidence and convicted Del Prado of rape, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua*.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the accused is guilty of rape beyond reasonable doubt despite his defense of a consensual relationship.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court found the trial court's assessment of the witnesses' credibility to be correct, noting that the "sweetheart theory" defense was incredible and contrived. The Court reasoned that it is highly improbable for a 17-year-old girl to give up her virginity to a man she had known for only two months, refuse his marriage proposal, and then file a rape case merely to help a relative extort money [1].

The alleged inconsistencies in the victim's testimony (e.g., details on how her clothes were removed) were deemed insignificant and did not affect the veracity of her narration [2]. Since the rape was committed with the use of a deadly weapon (a knife), the proper penalty under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code is *reclusion perpetua* to death. However, as the death penalty was suspended under the 1987 Constitution at the time, the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* was correctly imposed [3].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
