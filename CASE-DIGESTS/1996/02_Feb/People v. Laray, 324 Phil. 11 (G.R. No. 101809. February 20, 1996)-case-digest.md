**I. CAPTION**
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROGER LARAY, REWEL RABANES, NOLI ENERIO, FEDERICO LARAY, AND GOROSPE (JUARIO) OMILAO**, G.R. No. 101809, February 20, 1996, 324 Phil. 11, Francisco, J.

**II. FACTS**
On the evening of July 27, 1989, Hilda Jamis, an illiterate woman, was pulled by appellant Roger Laray from a benefit dance to a secluded area. Four other men—Rewel Rabanes, Noli Enerio, Federico Laray, and Gorospe Omilao—joined Roger. They held Hilda while Roger punched her stomach, causing her to lose consciousness. When she awoke, Roger was raping her. The other men subsequently took turns raping her while holding her down. Roger claimed he and Hilda were sweethearts and the act was consensual. The other appellants raised defenses of denial and alibi. The trial court convicted all five appellants of multiple rape, sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua*.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N Roger Laray’s defense of a consensual relationship negates the commission of rape.
2. W/N the identification of the accused was sufficient to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** Even assuming *arguendo* that Roger and Hilda were sweethearts, this does not negate rape. The Court held that "a sweetheart cannot be forced to have sex against her will; from a mere fiancee a man cannot definitely demand sexual submission and worse, employ violence upon her." [1] The use of force was corroborated by medical findings showing thirteen abrasions on the victim's body. Furthermore, Roger's claim was belied by his conduct; he fled the scene when "intruders" allegedly arrived, leaving Hilda behind, which is contrary to human experience for a lover. [2]

2. **YES for Roger Laray and Noli Enerio; NO for the others.** The Court affirmed the conviction of Roger (the principal attacker) and Noli Enerio. Noli was positively identified because he is the victim's uncle. [3, 4] However, the Court acquitted Rabanes, Federico Laray, and Omilao. Hilda had never met these three prior to the incident, the crime scene was dark (lit only by stars), and she admitted being unconscious during parts of the assault. She only identified them because she allegedly heard Roger call out their names. [4, 5] The Court ruled that presumption of innocence prevails when identification is uncorroborated and based on compromised observation. [6]

**Disposition:** The judgment is **AFFIRMED** as to Roger Laray and Noli Enerio, with the modification that each is sentenced to two counts of *reclusion perpetua* and ordered to pay P200,000.00 total indemnity (P50,000 per count). The judgment is **REVERSED** as to Rewel Rabanes, Federico Laray, and Gorospe Omilao, who are **ACQUITTED** on reasonable doubt. [7]
