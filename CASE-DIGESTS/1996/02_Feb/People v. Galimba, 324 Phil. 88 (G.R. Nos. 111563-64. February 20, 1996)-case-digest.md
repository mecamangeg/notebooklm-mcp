**I. CAPTION**
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ALBINO GALIMBA Y SISON**, G.R. Nos. 111563-64, February 20, 1996, 324 Phil. 88, Francisco, J.

**II. FACTS**
The appellant, Albino Galimba, was charged with two counts of rape committed against his 10-year-old niece, Maria Sarah Villareal [1]. In September 1991, Galimba pulled the victim into bed, removed her underwear, applied cooking oil to his organ, and inserted it into her vagina despite her protests [2]. On December 19, 1991, the victim’s sister witnessed Galimba lying on top of the victim inside their house [3, 4].

A medical examination by Dr. Marcial Ceñido on December 20, 1991, revealed that the victim’s private parts had no lacerations and her hymen was intact [5]. The doctor initially opined that virginity was maintained but admitted on trial that rape is possible without actual penetration or laceration [5, 6]. The defense waived its right to present evidence, relying on the medical findings [5]. The Regional Trial Court convicted Galimba of two counts of rape and sentenced him to double life imprisonment [7]. Galimba appealed, arguing that the absence of lacerations negated rape and attacking the victim's credibility [8, 9].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the accused is guilty of rape despite the medical finding of an intact hymen and lack of lacerations.
2. W/N the accused is guilty of the second count of rape allegedly committed on December 19, 1991.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that full penetration is not required to sustain a conviction for rape; it is sufficient to prove the entrance of the male organ within the labia of the pudendum [10]. Penetration of the penis by entry into the lips of the female organ, even without rupture or laceration of the hymen, suffices to warrant conviction [10]. The Court gave full credence to the testimony of the young victim that the appellant inserted his penis into her organ during the September 1991 incident, noting that young rape victims are unlikely to concoct such stories [10, 11].

2. **NO.** Regarding the December 19, 1991 incident, the prosecution failed to establish that the appellant was able to consummate the act [12]. There was an absence of testimony proving even the "slightest penetration" of the victim's organ, and no physical evidence confirmed it [12].

The Court affirmed the conviction for the rape committed in September 1991 but modified the penalty from life imprisonment to *reclusion perpetua*, as these penalties are not synonymous [13]. The civil indemnity was increased to P50,000 [13]. The appellant was acquitted of the second count of rape.
