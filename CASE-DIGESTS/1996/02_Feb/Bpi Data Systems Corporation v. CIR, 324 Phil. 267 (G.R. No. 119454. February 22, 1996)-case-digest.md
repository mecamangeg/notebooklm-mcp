I. CAPTION
BPI DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS, COURT OF TAX APPEALS, AND COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. 119454, February 22, 1996, 324 Phil. 267, Vitug, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner BPI Data Systems Corporation sought a tax refund from the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). The CTA denied the claim, and Petitioner received the decision on March 18, 1994. On April 2, 1994, the fifteenth and last day of the reglementary period, Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR). The CTA denied the MR, and Petitioner received the notice of denial on July 12, 1994. The following day, July 13, 1994, Petitioner filed a motion for extension of time to file a petition for review with the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA denied the petition, ruling that the motion for extension was filed one day late, implying the appeal should have been filed on the very same day the denial was received. Petitioner's subsequent MR was denied.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's motion for extension to file a petition for review was filed on time.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the motion was timely filed. Adopting the doctrine in *Mara, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* and *Lloren v. De Veyra*, the Court ruled that when a motion for reconsideration is filed on the 15th or last day of the reglementary period, that day is excluded from the computation of the remaining time. Therefore, when the party receives the order denying the motion, they still have one (1) day within which to perfect their appeal. Applying the standard rule of excluding the day of receipt and including the next day, Petitioner correctly filed the motion on July 13, 1994, the day following the receipt of the denial on July 12. The Court emphasized the necessity of a uniform rule for computing appeal periods to avoid confusion.

The petition is GRANTED, the questioned resolutions are set aside, and the Court of Appeals is directed to reinstate the petition for review.
