I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RICARDO SAN GABRIEL Y ORTIZ, G.R. No. 107735, February 1, 1996, 323 Phil. 102.

II. FACTS
Accused Ricardo San Gabriel was charged with the murder of Jaime Tonog [1], [2]. The prosecution established that after a fistfight between the victim and the accused (accompanied by a "Ramon Doe") was pacified by onlookers, the accused and Ramon left but returned approximately five minutes later armed with bladed weapons [3], [4]. They surreptitiously circled the victim, who had remained at the scene, and launched a sudden and simultaneous attack; the accused stabbed Tonog in the back while Ramon stabbed him in the abdomen [5], [3]. Prosecution witnesses Brenda Gonzales and Pio Ochobillo positively identified the accused [6].

The accused claimed he merely helped the victim and that Gonzales testified falsely due to a grudge over a P300.00 debt and business rivalry [1], [6]. He also pointed to a certain "Mando" as the killer but failed to present any evidence regarding Mando's identity [7]. The defense also relied on an Advance Information Sheet (police blotter) which did not name the accused, to discredit the witnesses [8]. The trial court convicted the accused of murder [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the prosecution witnesses were credible despite the alleged grudge and discrepancies with the police blotter.
2. W/N the killing was attended by treachery.
3. W/N the killing was attended by evident premeditation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court found the witnesses testified in a direct and candid manner without evil motive [6]. The alleged grudge over a "measly sum" was insufficient reason to testify falsely in such a grave crime [6]. The Court ruled that entries in the Advance Information Sheet are merely *prima facie* evidence, often incomplete or inaccurate, and cannot defeat positive testimony given in court [8]. Moreover, the document was inadmissible as the officer who prepared it lacked personal knowledge [9].

2. **YES.** Treachery was present because the victim was lulled into complacency after the initial fistfight was pacified [3]. The accused employed means to ensure the execution of the crime without risk to himself by returning with weapons, circling the victim surreptitiously, and launching a sudden attack while the victim was unarmed and totally unprepared [10], [3].

3. **NO.** Evident premeditation was not proven as the five-minute interval between the fistfight and the attack was insufficient for the accused to coolly reflect and meditate on the consequences of his acts [4].

The petition is **DENIED**. The decision convicting the accused of murder is **AFFIRMED** with **MODIFICATION**; the penalty is changed from life imprisonment to *reclusion perpetua*, and the indemnity increased to P50,000.00 [2].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Padilla, Vitug, Kapunan, and Hermosisima, Jr., JJ., concurred [2].
