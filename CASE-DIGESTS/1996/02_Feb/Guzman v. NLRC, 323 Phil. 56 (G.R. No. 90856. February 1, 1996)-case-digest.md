I. CAPTION
ARTURO DE GUZMAN v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, ET AL., G.R. No. 90856, February 1, 1996, 323 Phil. 56, Francisco, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Arturo de Guzman was the General Manager of Affiliated Machineries Agency, Ltd. (AMAL). Following AMAL's cessation of operations in 1986, private respondent employees filed a complaint for illegal dismissal and non-payment of statutory benefits. They impleaded Petitioner for selling AMAL’s assets and applying the proceeds to satisfy his own claims against the company, to their prejudice. The Labor Arbiter held Petitioner jointly and severally liable with AMAL, which the NLRC affirmed.

In a July 23, 1992 decision, the Supreme Court modified the ruling: it absolved Petitioner of solidary liability for the labor claims (finding he did not decide the closure) but held him liable for moral and exemplary damages and ordered the return of the appropriated assets due to his bad faith. Petitioner filed the instant Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the award of damages and the order to return assets were beyond the Court's jurisdiction. He contended that since there was no employer-employee relationship between him and the respondents, the matter was civil in nature and belonged to regular courts.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court has jurisdiction to award damages and order the return of appropriated assets against the Petitioner despite the lack of an employer-employee relationship.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that in labor disputes, it is not required that the claim for relief directly result from an employer-employee relationship; it suffices that there is a **reasonable causal connection** between the claim asserted and the employer-employee relations [1].

Petitioner’s bad faith in appropriating AMAL's assets were "offshoots" of the termination of employment relations [2]. His unscrupulous acts rendered the satisfaction of the employees' legitimate claims impossible [1]. Citing *Pepsi-Cola Distributors of the Philippines v. Gal-lang*, the Court affirmed that this causal connection justifies jurisdiction [1], [3]. Furthermore, Petitioner's defense of legal compensation was rejected as it contravened the Civil Code provisions on concurrence and preference of credits [2].

The Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED** with finality [4].
