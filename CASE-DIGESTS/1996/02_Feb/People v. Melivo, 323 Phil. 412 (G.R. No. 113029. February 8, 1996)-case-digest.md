I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. APOLONIO MELIVO Y VALETE, G.R. No. 113029, February 8, 1996, 323 Phil. 412, Kapunan, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of June 1, 1992, accused-appellant Apolonio Melivo fetched his 16-year-old daughter, Maritess, from her workplace in Tarlac. While walking home on a footpath in Gerona, Tarlac, Apolonio threatened Maritess with a knife, slapped her, and raped her. He committed four subsequent acts of rape against her inside their home. Maritess only reported the incidents to her mother and grandfather on August 11, 1992, over two months later, due to Apolonio's repeated threats to kill her.

The RTC of Tarlac convicted Apolonio of Rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua*. Apolonio appealed, arguing that the victim's delay in reporting the crime was contrary to the natural course of things and that the medical findings (showing only healed lacerations) were inconsistent with the alleged size of his organ, suggesting fabrication motivated by family resentment.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the victim’s delay in reporting the rape impairs her credibility.
2. W/N the lack of extensive genital injuries negates the commission of rape.
3. W/N the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that delay in reporting rape incidents, especially in the face of threats, cannot be taken against the victim. In incestuous rape, the perpetrator uses his moral ascendancy and blood relationship to instill "extreme psychological terror" and silence the victim. Citing *People v. Lucas* and *People v. Casil*, the Court ruled that silence is often compelled by fear and does not indicate fabrication.

2. **NO.** The Court rejected the appellant's argument that his alleged large penile dimensions should have caused more severe injuries than the "healed lacerations" found. Relying on medical testimony, the Court explained that the vaginal wall and hymen are elastic and distensible. The presence of healed lacerations was sufficient proof of traumatic injury, and the absence of extensive tearing does not negate the occurrence of rape.

3. **YES.** The Court affirmed the conviction, applying the doctrine that a young, unmarried woman would not falsely charge her own father with a heinous crime and subject herself to public shame unless it were true. The Court found the victim’s testimony credible and straightforward, ruling that the accused’s uncorroborated alibi and denial could not prevail over positive identification and the medical evidence.

The decision of the trial court is **AFFIRMED** *in toto*.
