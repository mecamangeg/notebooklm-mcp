I. CAPTION
ANTONIO NAVALE, et al. v. COURT OF APPEALS, et al., G.R. No. 109957, February 20, 1996, 324 Phil. 70, Romero, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondents filed an action for forcible entry and damages against petitioners (Antonio Navale, et al.) with the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) in Cagayan de Oro City regarding a portion of the Bagting Estate [1]. The MTCC declared petitioners in default and rendered judgment against them, issuing writs of execution and demolition [2]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with the Regional Trial Court (RTC), claiming the MTCC lacked jurisdiction over their persons because they were never validly summoned [2]. The RTC dismissed the petition, finding that the Sheriff had served summons which petitioners refused to accept or provide names for, prompting the Sheriff to leave copies at their residences and with the estate administrator, Eligio Valdehueza [2]. Furthermore, the RTC found that petitioners had voluntarily appeared by filing answers and motions in the proceedings [3]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC decision [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the MTCC acquired jurisdiction over the persons of the petitioners.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that jurisdiction was properly acquired over the petitioners.

First, under Section 7, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court, if a defendant refuses to receive summons, tendering it to them is sufficient valid service [4, 5]. The record showed petitioners refused to receive the summons or give their names [5].

Second, Section 23 of Rule 14 provides that a defendant's voluntary appearance in the action shall be equivalent to service [4]. The Court found that petitioners voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the court by: (1) filing an answer to the contempt charge; (2) pleading for an extension of time to vacate the premises; and (3) agreeing to vacate during an ocular inspection [6-8]. Even the filing of the petition for certiorari was considered evidence of voluntary submission [8].

Finally, the Court applied the doctrine in *La Naval Drug Corporation v. Court of Appeals*, stating that the defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person must be seasonably raised in a motion to dismiss or answer; otherwise, voluntary appearance deems it waived [9]. Petitioners failed to object to the MTCC's jurisdiction from the beginning and only raised it after an adverse judgment [10, 11].

The petition is DENIED and the decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED in toto [12].
