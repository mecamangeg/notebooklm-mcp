I. CAPTION
L.T. DATU AND CO., INC., AND/OR HERMILO DATU v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, LABOR ARBITER JOSE G. DE VEYRA, VICTOR MELANIO AND GREGORIO F. FLORENDO, G.R. No. 113162, November 4, 1996, 323 Phil. 521, Kapunan, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondents Melanio and Florendo were hired by petitioner L.T. Datu and Co., Inc. as plumbers in June 1979 [1]. On July 19, 1991, following a protest by workers regarding delayed salaries where they timed in but stayed in the quarters, petitioner issued a memorandum stating "I would NOT LIKE TO SEE them in this project anymore" and instructed them to report to the office to settle their salaries [1-3]. Respondents considered this a termination and filed a complaint for illegal dismissal [4]. Petitioner argued the memorandum was merely a transfer order and that respondents were project employees [5, 6]. The Labor Arbiter ruled the dismissal illegal and awarded separation pay [7]. The NLRC affirmed the decision but modified it to include backwages [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the memorandum constituted illegal dismissal.
2. W/N the private respondents were regular employees.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the memorandum was a dismissal letter, not a transfer order. It explicitly stated the employer did not want to see them in the project anymore and required the settlement of salaries, which implies termination [9]. If it were a transfer, it should have specified the new assignment [10]. Furthermore, while the workers refused to work to protest unpaid salaries, such an act does not justify termination without complying with the mandatory requirements of notice and hearing (due process) [3, 11].

2. **YES.** The respondents were regular employees, not project employees. Under Article 280 of the Labor Code, they performed activities (plumbing) that were necessary and desirable to the petitioner's construction business [6, 12]. The fact that they worked continuously for 12 years without appreciable gaps between projects proves they belonged to a work pool and were employees for an indefinite period under Policy Instruction No. 20 [13, 14]. As held in *Phesco, Inc. v. NLRC*, when project employment is extended long after the project constitutes a work pool, the employees become regular [13].

The petition is DISMISSED [15].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Padilla, Bellosillo, Vitug, and Hermosisima, JJ., concurred [15].
