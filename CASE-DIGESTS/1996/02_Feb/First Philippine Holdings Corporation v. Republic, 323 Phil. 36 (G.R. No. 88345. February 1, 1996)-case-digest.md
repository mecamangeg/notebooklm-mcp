I. CAPTION
FIRST PHILIPPINE HOLDINGS CORPORATION v. HON. SANDIGANBAYAN, REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, BENJAMIN (KOKOY) ROMUALDEZ, JULIETTE GOMEZ ROMUALDEZ, TRANS MIDDLE EAST (PHILS.) EQUITIES, INC., and EDILBERTO S. NARCISO, JR., G.R. No. 88345, February 1, 1996, 323 Phil. 36, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
The Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) filed Civil Case No. 0035 before the Sandiganbayan (SB) against spouses Benjamin and Juliette Romualdez and others for the reconveyance of "ill-gotten" wealth, including 6,299,177 shares of Philippine Commercial International Bank (PCIBank). The PCGG alleged these shares were acquired by the Romualdezes using Trans Middle East (Phils.) Equities, Inc. (Equities) and Edilberto Narciso, Jr. as dummies.

Petitioner First Philippine Holdings Corporation (FPHC) filed a "Motion for Leave to Intervene," claiming ownership of the disputed shares. FPHC alleged that the sale of said shares to Equities in 1984 was void or voidable due to fraud and unconscionably low price (P47 million vs. P104 million book value), and that Equities was merely a front for the Romualdezes. The Sandiganbayan denied the motion, ruling that the dispute was intra-corporate and personal in nature, thus outside its jurisdiction, and that intervention would unduly delay proceedings. FPHC filed the instant petition for Certiorari and Mandamus.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N FPHC has a legal interest to intervene in the civil case.
2. W/N the Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction over FPHC's claim regarding the validity of the sale of sequestered shares.
3. W/N mandamus lies to compel the Sandiganbayan to admit the intervention.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Rule 12, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, a person may intervene if they are "so situated as to be adversely affected by a distribution or other disposition of property in the custody of the court." The PCIBank shares are sequestered and thus in the custody of the court [1]. FPHC claims ownership against both the PCGG and Equities; therefore, it would be adversely affected by any judgment distributing the property to either party [2].

2. **YES.** The Sandiganbayan has exclusive and original jurisdiction over cases involving "ill-gotten wealth" under Executive Order No. 14, which extends to "all incidents arising from, incidental to, or related to, such cases" (*PCGG v. Peña*) [3]. This includes disputes over the sale of sequestered shares, which cannot be subject to separate actions in other courts [4]. Splitting jurisdiction would violate the rule against multiplicity of suits and risk conflicting judgments [5].

3. **YES.** While intervention is generally discretionary, mandamus will issue in cases of "gross abuse of discretion, manifest injustice or palpable excess of authority" (*Kant Kwong v. PCGG*) [6]. The Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion by denying FPHC a remedy to recover property allegedly taken illegally, as the issue of ownership over sequestered assets falls squarely within its jurisdiction [7].

**ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRANTED; the questioned Resolutions are REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the respondent Court is DIRECTED to grant the petitioner’s motion for leave to intervene.**
