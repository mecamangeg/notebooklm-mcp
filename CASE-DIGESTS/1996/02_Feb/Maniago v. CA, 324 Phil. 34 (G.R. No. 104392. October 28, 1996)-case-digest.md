I. CAPTION
RUBEN MANIAGO v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and ALFREDO BOADO, G.R. No. 104392, October 28, 1996, 324 Phil. 34, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ruben Maniago owned shuttle buses. On January 7, 1990, his bus driven by Herminio Andaya collided with a jeepney owned by respondent Alfredo Boado. A criminal case for reckless imprudence was filed against the driver, Andaya [1]. Boado did not reserve the right to file a separate civil action in the criminal case [2].

Subsequently, Boado filed a separate civil action for damages against Maniago (the employer) [1]. Maniago moved to suspend the civil proceedings pending the criminal case, arguing that the civil action was impliedly instituted with the criminal action due to the lack of reservation. The RTC denied the motion, ruling that the action could proceed independently under the Civil Code [3]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC, citing jurisprudence that independent civil actions for damages do not require reservation [2]. While the appeal was pending, the criminal case against the driver was dismissed for failure to prosecute [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a separate civil action for damages against an employer based on quasi-delict may be maintained if the offended party failed to reserve the right to institute it in the criminal case against the employee.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and dismissed the complaint against the petitioner.

Under **Section 1, Rule 111 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure**, when a criminal action is instituted, the civil action for the recovery of civil liability is impliedly instituted with it, unless the offended party waives the civil action, reserves the right to institute it separately, or institutes it prior to the criminal action [5, 6]. This rule applies to civil liability arising from crimes (*ex delicto*) as well as independent civil actions under **Articles 32, 33, 34, and 2176 of the Civil Code** [6].

The Court held that the requirement of reservation is procedural and does not diminish substantive rights [7]. Its purpose is to prevent double recovery for the same act or omission [8]. While an employer's liability under **Article 2180** is primary and direct, the policy against double recovery requires that only one action be maintained for the same act. Since Boado failed to reserve the right to file a separate civil action, it was deemed impliedly instituted with the criminal case against the driver [9]. Consequently, the separate civil action against the employer was barred.

**Petition GRANTED. Decision REVERSED and the complaint against petitioner DISMISSED [10].**
