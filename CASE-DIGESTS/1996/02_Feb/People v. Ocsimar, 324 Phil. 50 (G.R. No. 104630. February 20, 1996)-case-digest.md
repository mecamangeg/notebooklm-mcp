I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ALEJANDRO OCSIMAR Y ALIGNO, G.R. No. 104630, February 20, 1996, 324 Phil. 50, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
On November 8, 1991, in Iligan City, appellant Alejandro Ocsimar stabbed his brother-in-law, Apolinario Lato, inside a passenger jeepney [1], [2]. Prosecution eyewitness Franklin Villamor, who was buying bread nearby, testified that he saw Ocsimar stab the victim from behind while the latter was seated [1], [3]. Ocsimar admitted the stabbing but claimed self-defense, alleging that Lato, who was drunk, had mauled and choked him inside the jeepney, forcing him to use a flower-cutting knife to defend himself [2].

The Regional Trial Court convicted Ocsimar of Murder, sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*, and ordered him to pay P50,000 indemnity. The trial court rejected the claim of self-defense, ruling that Ocsimar’s flight indicated guilt, and appreciated the qualifying circumstance of treachery because the attack was from behind [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Ocsimar acted in self-defense.
2. W/N the killing was qualified by treachery to constitute Murder.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court affirmed the rejection of the self-defense claim. When an accused invokes self-defense, the burden of proof shifts to them to prove justification with clear and convincing evidence [6]. Ocsimar failed to prove the essential element of unlawful aggression [6]. His testimony was not substantiated by strong evidence and was properly found not credible by the trial court, regardless of the issue of his flight [7].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that treachery was not established. Treachery must be proven as clearly as the crime itself [4], [8]. Although the witness saw the actual stabbing from behind, he admitted his attention was initially elsewhere and he did not see how the attack commenced [9], [10]. Where a lone eyewitness sees the incident already in progress and fails to observe the inception of the assault, treachery cannot be appreciated [8]. The mere fact that the wound was in the back does not necessarily prove treachery absent evidence of how the aggression started [8].

Consequently, the petition was **GRANTED** in part. The decision was **MODIFIED**; Ocsimar was convicted only of **Homicide** and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years of *prision mayor* minimum to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of *reclusion temporal* medium [11], [12].
