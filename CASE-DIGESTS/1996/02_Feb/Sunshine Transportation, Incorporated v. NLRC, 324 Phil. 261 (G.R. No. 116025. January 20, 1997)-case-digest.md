I. CAPTION
SUNSHINE TRANSPORTATION, INCORPORATED v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND REALUCIO R. SANTOS, G.R. No. 116025, January 20, 1997, 324 Phil. 261, Davide Jr., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Sunshine Transportation, Inc. hired private respondent Realucio R. Santos as a bus driver. Santos was subsequently terminated for alleged insubordination and failure to submit a written explanation for an absence. He filed a complaint for illegal dismissal and various money claims. The Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint, finding the dismissal valid and denying the money claims. On appeal, the NLRC affirmed the validity of the dismissal but modified the decision by granting Santos' money claims amounting to P158,000.00, noting that the petitioner failed to refute the claim of underpayment. Petitioner filed a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 directly with the Supreme Court to question the award, without first filing a Motion for Reconsideration with the NLRC.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for certiorari under Rule 65 is proper despite the petitioner's failure to file a Motion for Reconsideration with the NLRC.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, a petition for certiorari requires that there be no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Section 14, Rule VII of the New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC explicitly provides for the filing of a Motion for Reconsideration, which serves as a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy. In light of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, a motion for reconsideration is a mandatory condition precedent before a special civil action for certiorari may be availed of. Since the petitioner failed to file a motion for reconsideration and did not provide any plausible reason for direct recourse to the Court, the petition was **DISMISSED**.
