I. CAPTION
WESTERN SHIPPING AGENCY, INC., YEH SHIPPING CO. LTD. AND PHIL. BRITISH ASSURANCE CO., INC. v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND ALEXANDER S. BAO, G.R. No. 109717, February 9, 1996, 323 Phil. 479, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondent Alexander S. Bao was hired by Western Shipping Agency, Inc. (manning agent for Yeh Shipping Co. Ltd.) as Master of the vessel M/V Sea Wealth for one year starting April 21, 1988. On January 14, 1989, Bao was discharged. Petitioners justified the dismissal citing loss of trust and confidence due to: (1) Bao’s alleged failure to notify the office of the vessel’s arrival in Manila; and (2) accommodating unauthorized passengers (wives and children of the crew) on the voyage from Davao to Manila without approval, purportedly endangering the vessel. Petitioners later added that Bao violated Central Bank regulations regarding foreign currency.

Bao filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, arguing that: (1) he notified Western Shipping of the arrival via telex; (2) the company president, Noimi Zabala, was informed of the passengers by phone and did not object; (3) the shipowner's agent in Davao, World Mariner Philippines, Inc., secured permits for the passengers; and (4) the Coast Guard issued a clearance to sail after inspection. The POEA ruled that Bao was illegally dismissed. The NLRC affirmed the decision with modification, awarding salaries for the unexpired portion of the contract.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N private respondent Bao was illegally dismissed based on loss of trust and confidence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The dismissal was illegal. While loss of confidence is a valid ground for dismissing managerial employees like a vessel Master, such loss must be substantiated by evidence. Managerial employees enjoy security of tenure and can only be dismissed for cause [1].

The Court found that petitioners failed to discharge the burden of proof. Evidence showed that: (1) Western Shipping’s president knew of the additional passengers and did not object [2]; (2) the shipowner’s agent secured the necessary permits from Customs and the Coast Guard [2]; (3) the Coast Guard clearance proved the vessel's seaworthiness and compliance with safety requirements, as the life-saving equipment on board was adequate for the 36 persons present (capacity for 75) [3]; and (4) Bao had indeed sent a telex notifying petitioners of the vessel's arrival, which petitioners acknowledged [4]. Consequently, Bao is entitled to the payment of his salary corresponding to the unexpired portion of his employment contract [5].

The petition is DISMISSED.
