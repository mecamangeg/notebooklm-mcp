I. CAPTION
PAMBANSANG KAPATIRAN NG MGA ANAK PAWIS SA FORMEY PLASTIC NATIONAL WORKERS BROTHERHOOD v. SECRETARY OF LABOR, SECRETARY BIENVENIDO LAGUESMA, FORMEY PLASTIC, INC., KALIPUNAN NG MANGGAGAWANG PILIPINO (KAMAPI) AND MED-ARBITER RASIDALI C. ABDULLAH, G.R. No. 111836, December 23, 1996, 323 Phil. 116, Bellosillo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pambansang Kapatiran ng mga Anak Pawis sa Formey Plastic (KAPATIRAN), a local union under the National Workers Brotherhood, filed a Petition for Certification Election (PCE) on April 22, 1993, claiming there was no existing Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) at Formey Plastic, Inc. [1]. Respondent Formey Plastic and intervenor union KAMAPI moved to dismiss the petition, invoking the "contract bar rule" due to an existing CBA covering the period from January 1, 1992 to December 31, 1996 [2]. KAPATIRAN opposed, arguing the CBA was fraudulently registered and defective because it was signed by the federation (KAMAPI) rather than the local union [2].

The Med-Arbiter dismissed the petition based on the contract bar rule [3]. The Secretary of Labor affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the CBA was valid and the PCE was filed outside the freedom period [3]. KAPATIRAN filed this petition for certiorari, alleging grave abuse of discretion [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for certification election is barred by the contract bar rule.
2. W/N the CBA is invalid because it was executed by the federation (KAMAPI) instead of the local union.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Article 253-A of the Labor Code and Section 3, Rule V, Book V of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, a petition for certification election can only be entertained within the sixty (60) day "freedom period" immediately before the expiration of the five-year term of the CBA [4]. Here, the CBA was effective from January 1, 1992 to December 31, 1996. The petition filed on April 22, 1993 was clearly outside the freedom period and must fail [5]. Furthermore, allegations that the CBA is "fake" or not being implemented do not justify a certification election; violations of a CBA are matters for the grievance machinery or voluntary arbitration under Article 261 of the Labor Code, not a ground to disregard the contract bar rule [5, 6].

2. **NO.** The CBA is valid. A perusal of the agreement showed it was signed by KAMAPI's national president and the duly elected officers of the local union [7]. The fact that the federation was named as the bargaining party does not strip it of authority to participate, as the mother union acts as an agent while the local union remains the basic unit [8]. The Court distinguished this from *Progressive Development Corporation* and *Liberty Cotton Mills*, noting those cases did not involve an admittedly existing and valid CBA [8].

The petition is **DENIED** and the decision of the Secretary of Labor is **AFFIRMED** [9].
