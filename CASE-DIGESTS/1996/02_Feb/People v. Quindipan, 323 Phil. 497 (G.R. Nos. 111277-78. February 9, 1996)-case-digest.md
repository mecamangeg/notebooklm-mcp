I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CLEMENTE QUINDIPAN, RUDY QUINDIPAN AND GEORGE FRIAL, G.R. Nos. 111277-78, February 9, 1996, 323 Phil. 497, Vitug, J.

II. FACTS
On November 28, 1983, Florentino Queddeng was shot and killed in Caoayan, Ilocos Sur [1]. The prosecution's case relied principally on the testimony of Pio Queddeng, the victim's brother, who claimed to have witnessed Clemente and Monico Quindipan shooting Florentino while Rudy Quindipan and George Frial acted as lookouts [2]. However, Pio did not immediately implicate the accused. Instead, investigation records and testimony from SPO4 Edilberto Rapanut revealed that Pio initially identified a certain Fernando Allagao as the suspect [3-5]. The accused raised the defense of alibi, supported by witnesses placing them elsewhere during the incident [6-8]. The Regional Trial Court convicted the accused of murder [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused are guilty beyond reasonable doubt despite the delay and inconsistency in the eyewitness identification.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court acquitted the accused because the prosecution failed to establish moral certainty of guilt [9]. The conviction rested on the testimony of Pio Queddeng, but his reluctance to promptly disclose the alleged killers and his initial identification of a different suspect (Allagao) rendered his testimony unreliable [3, 10]. The Court applied the doctrine that while alibi is inherently weak, it assumes importance when the prosecution's evidence is equally tenuous [11]. Citing *People v. Adofina* and *People v. Aniscal*, the Court emphasized that the weakness of the defense cannot be used to fortify the prosecution's cause, which must rely on its own strength [11].

WHEREFORE, the decision of the trial court is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accused-appellants are ACQUITTED on reasonable doubt [9].
