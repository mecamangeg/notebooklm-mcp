I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FELIX ESQUILA, G.R. No. 116727, February 27, 1996, 324 Phil. 366, Melo, J.

II. FACTS
The accused, Felix Esquila, lived with his 13-year-old granddaughter, Maribeth, and her younger brother in a nipa hut in Bansalan, Davao del Sur. On October 15, 1991, at around midnight, Maribeth woke up to find the accused on top of her. He tied her hands and legs, covered her mouth with a cloth, and pointed a knife at her before sexually assaulting her. Her brother witnessed the incident. The following day, Maribeth escaped and reported the crime. A medical examination confirmed she had lost her physical virginity.

The accused raised the defense of denial and alibi, claiming Maribeth had run away a month prior. He challenged her credibility, citing inconsistencies in her testimony regarding the specific dates she was present in his house versus when she was in the Poblacion looking for work. The Regional Trial Court convicted Esquila of rape, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua*.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt despite alleged inconsistencies in the victim's testimony.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court ruled that inconsistencies in the testimony of witnesses regarding minor details and collateral matters—such as the specific dates or places of stay prior to the crime—do not affect the substance of their declaration or their veracity [1]. The Court applied the doctrine that testimonies of young and immature rape victims are credible, as "the revelation of an innocent child whose chastity was abused demands full credence" (*People v. Guibao*), and minor inconsistencies are to be expected from persons of tender years (*People v. Gozum*) [2, 3]. Furthermore, no ill motive could be ascribed to the victim, as no young Filipina of decent repute would expose herself to the public shame of a rape trial unless she was truly aggrieved (*People v. Avero*), especially against her own grandfather [4].

The decision of the trial court was AFFIRMED, with the modification that the civil indemnity was increased from P20,000.00 to P50,000.00 [5].
