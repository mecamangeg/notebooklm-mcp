I. CAPTION
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES v. COURT OF APPEALS, MYLO O. QUINTO AND JESUSA CHRISTINE S. CHUPUICO, G.R. No. 109946, November 4, 1996, 323 Phil. 489, Bellosillo, J.

II. FACTS
On April 20, 1978, Petitioner Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) granted a loan of P94,000.00 to Spouses Santiago and Oliva Olidiana. To secure the loan, the spouses executed a real estate mortgage over several properties, including Lot 2029 (Pls-61). At the time of the mortgage, Lot 2029 was still the subject of a Free Patent application filed by the Olidianas with the Bureau of Lands. In 1979, the spouses obtained an additional loan and executed a second mortgage over the same properties.

Upon the spouses' failure to pay, DBP extrajudicially foreclosed on the properties and acquired them as the highest bidder in a public auction on April 14, 1983. However, when DBP attempted to register the sale and consolidate ownership, it discovered that Lot 2029 had already been divided and titled under OCT No. P-27,361 in the names of respondents Jesusa Christine Chupuico and Mylo O. Quinto. DBP filed an action for Quieting of Title and Cancellation of Certificate of Title. The Regional Trial Court ruled against DBP, declaring the mortgages void because the mortgagors were not the absolute owners of the land at the time of the mortgage, violating Article 2085 of the New Civil Code. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the mortgage executed by the Olidiana spouses over the land subject to a Free Patent Application is valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the mortgage was void and ineffectual. Under Article 2085 of the New Civil Code, it is an essential requisite for a valid mortgage that the mortgagor be the absolute owner of the thing mortgaged. At the time the Olidiana spouses mortgaged Lot 2029 to DBP, it was still the subject of a miscellaneous sales application and remained part of the public domain.

Citing *Visayan Realty, Inc. v. Meer*, the Court explained that the mere approval of a sales application only authorizes the applicant to take possession to comply with legal requirements; the government remains the owner until the sales patent is issued and registered. It is the registration and issuance of the certificate of title that segregate public lands from the mass of the public domain and convert them into private property. Since the Olidiana spouses were not owners in fee simple at the time of the mortgage, they could not validly encumber the property. Consequently, DBP acquired no valid title through the foreclosure.

The petition is **DENIED** and the decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
