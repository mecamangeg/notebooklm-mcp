I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. JUDGE ANTONIO C. EVANGELISTA AND GRILDO S. TUGONON, G.R. No. 110898, October 28, 1996, 324 Phil. 80, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondent Grildo S. Tugonon was charged and convicted by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Misamis Oriental for frustrated homicide [1, 2]. He was sentenced to one year of *prision correccional* [2]. Tugonon appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed his conviction but modified the penalty to an indeterminate sentence of 2 months of *arresto mayor* to 2 years and 4 months of *prision correccional* [3].

On December 28, 1992, after the CA rendered its decision, Tugonon filed a petition for probation with the RTC [3]. The Chief Probation and Parole Officer recommended the denial of the application, arguing that Tugonon waived his right to probation by appealing the conviction [4]. Despite this, respondent Judge Evangelista granted the application for probation [5]. The prosecution filed a petition alleging grave abuse of discretion [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the private respondent is eligible for probation after having perfected an appeal from the judgment of conviction.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the private respondent is precluded from the benefits of probation. Under Section 4 of P.D. No. 968 (Probation Law), as amended by P.D. No. 1990, "no application for probation shall be entertained or granted if the defendant has perfected the appeal from the judgment of conviction" [6].

The Court explained that the amendment was intended to put a stop to the practice of appealing a judgment of conviction to secure an acquittal and applying for probation only if the accused fails in his bid [6]. The law considers the filing of a probation application as a waiver of the right to appeal [7]. Since Tugonon filed his application in 1992 (after the effectivity of P.D. No. 1990) and had already perfected his appeal to the CA, he was no longer qualified for probation [7]. The perfection of the appeal referred to in the law is the appeal from the trial court's judgment of conviction, not the appellate court's decision [8].

The petition is **GRANTED** and the RTC order granting probation to private respondent is **SET ASIDE** [9].
