I. CAPTION
SPOUSES VICTOR WARLITO V. YBAÑEZ and VIRGINIA A. YBAÑEZ v. COURT OF APPEALS and SPOUSES AVELINO P. IFURUNG and VIRGINIA F. IFURUNG, G.R. No. 117499, February 9, 1996, 323 Phil. 643, Francisco, J.

II. FACTS
In 1984, petitioners Spouses Ybañez sold a lot to private respondents Spouses Ifurung with a right to repurchase within three months. Petitioners failed to repurchase and refused to vacate. In 1992, private respondents filed an ejectment suit in the MTC. Summons was served via substituted service to petitioners' brother. Petitioners failed to answer, and the MTC rendered judgment against them.

Petitioners appealed to the RTC, claiming invalid service of summons as they were abroad. The RTC affirmed the MTC decision, ruling the substituted service valid. Petitioners' subsequent appeal attempts failed due to wrong remedies and lateness, rendering the RTC judgment final. In 1994, petitioners filed a petition for annulment of the RTC judgment with the Court of Appeals (CA), alleging lack of jurisdiction due to invalid service of summons and extrinsic fraud. The CA ruled the substituted service was improper but dismissed the annulment petition because petitioners were barred from questioning jurisdiction after seeking affirmative relief in the RTC. The CA also found no extrinsic fraud.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the final judgment of the RTC may be annulled on the ground of lack of jurisdiction due to invalid service of summons.
2. W/N the judgment was obtained by means of extrinsic fraud.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The remedy of annulment of judgment is available only when the judgment is void for want of jurisdiction or obtained by extrinsic fraud. The RTC clearly had appellate jurisdiction over the MTC decision under Section 22 of B.P. Blg. 129 [1]. Furthermore, the issue of the validity of the substituted service of summons was exhaustively argued in the RTC appeal and decided against petitioners. Because petitioners failed to seasonably file a petition for review, the RTC ruling attained finality. Under the principle of **conclusiveness of judgment** (Rule 39, Section 49[c] of the Rules of Court), parties are precluded from relitigating a particular fact or issue (validity of summons) already determined in a prior final judgment [2, 3].

2. **NO.** Extrinsic fraud refers to an act or conduct of the prevailing party outside the trial which prevents the aggrieved party from presenting their case [4]. Petitioners alleged private respondents failed to inform the court regarding the non-assumption of the mortgage. The Court held that this omission, even if fraudulent, constitutes **intrinsic fraud** as it occurred during the litigation process and could have been determined at trial [5]. There was no evidence petitioners were prevented from presenting their case.

The petition is **DISMISSED**.
