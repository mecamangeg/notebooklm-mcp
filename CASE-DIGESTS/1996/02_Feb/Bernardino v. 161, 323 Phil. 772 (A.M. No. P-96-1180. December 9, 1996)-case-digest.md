I. CAPTION
ATTY. BENJAMIN B. BERNARDINO v. ARMANDO B. IGNACIO, A.M. No. P-96-1180, December 9, 1996, 323 Phil. 772, Kapunan, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Atty. Benjamin Bernardino, counsel for an accused in a criminal case, charged respondent Court Stenographer Armando Ignacio with anomalies in transcribing stenographic notes [1]. Two conflicting sets of Transcripts of Stenographic Notes (TSN) existed for the proceeding on August 16, 1993 [2]. The first set recorded a witness stating, "I was the one charged," and included a warning from the Judge to a person in the courtroom [2, 3]. The second set changed the testimony to "I was *not* the one charged" and deleted the Judge's warning [3, 4]. Respondent claimed he made the corrections in good faith before the records were forwarded [4, 5]. The Investigating Judge found respondent liable for grave misconduct for deliberately attempting to mislead, recommending a one-year suspension [6]. The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) opined that the penalty was too harsh as bad faith was not clearly proven [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent court stenographer is administratively liable for the discrepancies in the transcripts.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court found respondent liable for lack of diligence, though not for grave misconduct. The Court held that bad faith is not presumed and the complainant failed to prove malice or actual prejudice to his client [7, 8]. However, the respondent failed to exercise due care in transcribing his notes, which forced the creation of a second set of transcripts and exposed the court to suspicion [8].

The Court emphasized that a court stenographer performs a function essential to the administration of justice and is tasked with "making an accurate and faithful record of the court proceedings as well as its honest and authentic reproduction in the transcript," citing *Rodas v. Aquilizan* [9]. Negligence in this duty undermines litigants' faith in the judiciary.

ACCORDINGLY, respondent was SUSPENDED from office for two (2) months without pay for lack of diligence, with a stern WARNING [10].
