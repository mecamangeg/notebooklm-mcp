I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CARMELO FAIGANO Y GRUTAS, G.R. No. 113483, February 22, 1996, 324 Phil. 212, Bellosillo, J.

II. FACTS
On January 6, 1993, at about 1:30 A.M., Nely B. Ojina was sleeping in her house in Quezon City with her 4-month-old son and 3-year-old niece when she was awakened by the accused, Carmelo Faigano. Threatening her with a 29-inch *balisong* (knife), Faigano raped her. After satisfying his lust, he put on his clothes and ordered Nely to give him her money. He took P200.00 cash, a wristwatch worth P2,000.00, and two rings worth P760.00 before fleeing. Nely later reported the incident.
