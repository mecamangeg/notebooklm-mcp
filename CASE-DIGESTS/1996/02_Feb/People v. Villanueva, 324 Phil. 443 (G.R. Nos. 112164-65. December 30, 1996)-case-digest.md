I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SOLOMON VILLANUEVA Y ODE, G.R. Nos. 112164-65, December 30, 1996, 324 Phil. 443, Bellosillo, J.

II. FACTS
The accused, Solomon Villanueva, was charged with two counts of rape committed against his daughter, Lea. The first incident occurred on September 19, 1990, when Lea was 12 years old; the accused threatened to kill her and her family before raping her in their home in Tondo, Manila [1]. The abuse continued for two years, culminating in a specific charge for an incident on June 14, 1992, where he dragged her to his room and raped her for 30 minutes [2]. Following her mother's death on June 17, 1992, Lea fled to her grandmother on July 2, 1992, and revealed the abuse [3]. The NBI medical examination corroborated her claim, showing old lacerations [3]. The accused denied the charges, claiming alibi and arguing that Lea’s failure to resist or report the incidents earlier implied consent [4, 5]. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila convicted him of two counts of rape, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* for each count [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused is guilty of rape beyond reasonable doubt despite the victim's lack of physical resistance and delay in reporting.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The testimony of the victim was found to be categorical, positive, and convincing, as it is highly improbable for a young daughter to fabricate such heinous charges against her own father unless they are true [6, 7].

The Court ruled that physical resistance is not required in rape when threats and intimidation are employed, gripping the victim in fear [8]. Furthermore, the accused was the victim's father, exercising moral ascendancy over her, which rendered resistance futile [8]. Regarding the delay in reporting, the Court held that it is not uncommon for young girls to conceal assaults due to shame and fear of threats to their lives [9]. The accused's alibi and arguments regarding the duration of the assault were rejected as weak defenses against the credible testimony of the victim [10].

The Court also clarified that *reclusion perpetua* is an indivisible penalty imposed in its entirety regardless of mitigating or aggravating circumstances [11].

**Disposition:** The appealed decision is AFFIRMED. Solomon Villanueva is sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* for each count and ordered to pay P50,000.00 as indemnity and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count, totaling P150,000.00 [12].
