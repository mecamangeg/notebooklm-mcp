I. CAPTION
FELIPA GARBIN v. COURT OF APPEALS and SPOUSES ANTONIO JULIAN AND CASIMIRA GARBIN, G.R. No. 107653, February 5, 1996, 323 Phil. 228, Romero, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Pablo Garbin was the owner of Lot 12712 covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 33251. On October 31, 1955, he allegedly executed a Deed of Absolute Sale for the northern half of the lot in favor of his daughter, respondent Casimira Garbin, who registered an adverse claim on the title but not the sale itself [3]. On May 24, 1970, Pablo sold the entire lot to petitioner Felipa Garbin, who registered the sale and was issued Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 88932 [4].

After a protracted ejectment case filed in 1974 by Felipa and Pablo against the respondents—which respondents lost in the lower courts and the Supreme Court—respondents filed a complaint for annulment of sale on March 1, 1982 [4, 5]. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) dismissed the complaint, ruling in favor of Felipa. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the RTC, holding that the adverse claim constituted sufficient notice to Felipa, making her a buyer in bad faith [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the registration of an adverse claim by the first vendee prevails over the registered title of a subsequent vendee.
2. W/N the respondents' action is barred by laches.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the adverse claim does not prevail over the petitioner's title. Under Section 110 of the Land Registration Act (Act No. 496), the registration of an adverse claim acts only as a notice to third parties and does not confer instant title of ownership; the validity of the claim must still be judicially determined [7, 8]. The Court noted that respondents failed to register the actual Deed of Sale or surrender the owner's duplicate title, which are necessary steps to affect registered land (*Pilapil v. CA*) [9]. Furthermore, since Pablo Garbin denied selling the land to respondents, the Court concluded the sale "never transpired," rendering the adverse claim ineffective against Felipa’s TCT, which represents a superior right [9].

2. **YES.** The Court held that respondents are barred by laches. They allowed an "unexplained interval" to elapse before filing the annulment case in 1982—cited by the Court as a wait of "36 long years" from the execution of their alleged deed [10]. This failure to assert their right for an unreasonable time is construed as an abandonment of their right to claim ownership (*Vda. de Lima v. Tiu*) [11].

The petition is GRANTED. The decision of the Court of Appeals is SET ASIDE and the decision of the Regional Trial Court dismissing the complaint is REINSTATED [10].
