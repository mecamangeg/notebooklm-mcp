I. CAPTION
HEIDI M. GESLANI v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND AGNO VALLEY COLLEGE AND/OR FLORENTINO F. FRIAS, G.R. No. 113597, February 13, 1996, 323 Phil. 739, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On June 1, 1991, petitioner Heidi Geslani was appointed Head of the Pre-Elementary and Elementary Department of Agno Valley College by her husband, the then-school President, without the Board of Directors' approval. On September 21, 1992, the Board terminated her employment citing lack of administrative skills and qualifications. She filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. The Labor Arbiter ruled in her favor and ordered reinstatement, holding that her experience was equivalent to the Bachelor's degree required under the 1970 Manual of Regulations for Private Schools. On appeal, the NLRC modified the decision, ruling the dismissal valid because the 1992 Manual of Regulations, which superseded the 1970 Manual, required a Master’s degree for the position—a qualification petitioner lacked. However, finding that no hearing was conducted, the NLRC awarded indemnity for non-observance of due process and limited separation pay. Petitioner appealed, arguing the 1992 Manual should not apply to her appointment.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal for lack of qualifications based on the 1992 Manual of Regulations was valid.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The dismissal was valid. The Court held that reinstatement would serve no useful purpose because the petitioner is not qualified under the 1992 Manual of Regulations for Private Schools, which is currently in effect. Section 42 of the 1992 Manual requires a Principal to have a Master's degree, which petitioner does not possess [1, 2]. Furthermore, even under the 1970 Manual, petitioner failed to present documents proving she graduated with the required Bachelor's Degree in Elementary Education [3, 4]. The Court also applied the doctrine from *La Sallette of Santiago, Inc. v. NLRC*, stating that unlike faculty members, administrative officials like department heads do not normally acquire security of tenure and hold positions that are temporary or non-permanent [5]. While the substantive cause for dismissal was valid, the Court affirmed the NLRC's finding that due process was violated due to the lack of a hearing, sustaining the award for indemnity [6].

Petition DENIED. The decision of the NLRC is AFFIRMED.
