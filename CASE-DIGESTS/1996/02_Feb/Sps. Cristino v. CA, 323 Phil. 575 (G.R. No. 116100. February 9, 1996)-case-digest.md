I. CAPTION
SPOUSES CRISTINO AND BRIGIDA CUSTODIO AND SPOUSES LITO AND MARIA CRISTINA SANTOS v. COURT OF APPEALS, HEIRS OF PACIFICO C. MABASA AND REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF PASIG, METRO MANILA, BRANCH 181, G.R. No. 116100, February 9, 1996, 323 Phil. 575, Regalado, J.

II. FACTS
Pacifico Mabasa owned a property with a two-door apartment surrounded by other immovables owned by petitioners Spouses Custodio and Spouses Santos [1, 2]. A passageway through the petitioners' properties led to the public street [2]. When Mabasa acquired the property, tenants occupied the apartment [3]. Subsequently, petitioners constructed an adobe fence around their properties for privacy and safety, which narrowed and eventually enclosed the passageway [3]. As a result, Mabasa's tenants vacated the premises [3].

Mabasa filed a case for the grant of an easement of right of way [1]. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruled in favor of Mabasa, granting a permanent right of way subject to his payment of P8,000 indemnity to petitioners, but did not award damages to Mabasa [4]. Mabasa appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA) solely on the issue of damages, while petitioners did not appeal the grant of the easement [4, 5]. The CA affirmed the RTC decision but modified it by awarding Mabasa actual, moral, and exemplary damages totaling P105,000 based on unrealized rentals [6, 7]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the award of damages to private respondents (Mabasa) is proper.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the award of damages has no substantial legal basis because the injury suffered by the private respondents was *damnum absque injuria* (damage without injury) [7, 8].

For damages to be recoverable, there must be both a right of action for a legal wrong inflicted by the defendant and damage resulting to the plaintiff [8]. In this case, the petitioners committed no legal wrong. Their act of constructing a fence within their lot was a valid exercise of their rights as owners under Article 430 of the Civil Code, which allows every owner to enclose or fence their land [9].

At the time the fence was constructed, no servitude of right of way existed in favor of the private respondents; such right was only created by the RTC decision which granted the compulsory easement after payment of just compensation [10]. Since the petitioners acted lawfully in the exercise of their property rights, any loss or hardship suffered by the private respondents (such as lost rentals) is *damnum absque injuria*, for which the law provides no remedy [11, 12].

The petition is **GRANTED**. The decision of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED and SET ASIDE**, and the judgment of the trial court is **REINSTATED** [13].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
