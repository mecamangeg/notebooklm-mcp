I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROLAND DANAO, G.R. No. 116058, February 1, 1996, 323 Phil. 178, Regalado, J.

II. FACTS
On October 14, 1992, in Brgy. Batuhan, Masbate, 13-year-old Maria Aparejado was raped and killed by drowning in a mangrove area [1, 2]. The prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence to implicate the accused, Roland Danao. The victim’s mother testified that her daughter had previously complained that Danao was stalking her [3]. On the day of the crime, a neighbor, Feliciana Gonzaga, saw Danao following the victim shortly before she disappeared [3, 4]. Another witness, Bonifacio Manacho, saw Danao hurriedly leaving the mangrove area that evening [5, 6]. The following morning, Manacho encountered Danao's mother at the scene in a state of panic, attempting to conceal the discovery of the body [6]. The defense interposed denial and alibi, claiming Danao was playing billiards 200 meters away [7, 8]. The Regional Trial Court convicted Danao of rape with homicide and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* [9]. Danao appealed, arguing that the lack of direct eyewitness testimony resulted in insufficient evidence for conviction [10].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the circumstantial evidence is sufficient to convict the accused beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, ruling that direct evidence is not the only matrix for a finding of guilt [11]. Circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if: (1) there is more than one circumstance; (2) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (3) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt [11].

The Court found that the circumstances established—the victim’s prior complaints of stalking, the positive identification of the accused following the victim before the crime, the accused fleeing the scene, and his family’s attempts to cover up the crime—constituted an unbroken chain leading to the reasonable conclusion that Danao was the perpetrator [3, 6, 12]. Furthermore, the defense of alibi was rejected because it was not physically impossible for the accused to be at the scene of the crime, which was only 200 meters from his alleged location [8].

The appealed judgment is **AFFIRMED** *in toto* [13].
