I. CAPTION
NICOLAS L. LOPEZ v. JUDGE REYNALDO M. ALON, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, (BRANCH 40), SILAY CITY, NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, A.M. No. 95-95-RTJ, February 28, 1996, 324 Phil. 396, Puno, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Nicolas Lopez, the brother of the victim in Criminal Case No. 2422 (a murder case), charged Respondent Judge Alon with willful and unlawful delay in rendering judgment [1, 2]. The criminal case was submitted for decision in November 1993, but the decision was not rendered until August 9, 1995 [2]. Respondent Judge admitted the delay but claimed "honest negligence," attributing it to lost records caused by a water pipe leak, a chaotic office situation shared with another judge, and the complainant's failure to follow up on the case [2-4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent Judge is administratively liable for the delay in rendering the decision.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court found the complaint meritorious, holding the Respondent Judge administratively liable. Section 15, Article VIII of the Constitution mandates that all cases filed before lower courts must be decided within three (3) months from the date of submission [4]. While extensions may be granted for complex cases, the judge must file a proper application, which was not done in this case [4].

The Court ruled that a judge cannot avoid responsibility by blaming the chaotic status of his chambers or the complainant's failure to follow up; it is the judge's specific duty to decide cases in an organized manner within the required period [5]. The unjustified delay of over one and a half years caused undue suffering to the accused (whose liberty was at stake) and the victim's family, diminishing trust in the judicial system [5].

Accordingly, Respondent Judge was ordered to pay a fine of P10,000.00 with a stern warning [6].
