I. CAPTION
MIGUELA VDA. DE TISADO v. CLERK OF COURT PROSPERO V. TABLIZO, DEP. SHERIFF FELINOR R. TRAMPE, AND DEP. SHERIFF CARLOS M. UBALDE, A.M. No. P-94-1025, January 13, 1997, 324 Phil. 1, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Miguela Vda. de Tisado sought to enforce a 1983 judgment in an agrarian case ordering her reinstatement to a landholding. The judgment was revived in 1992 [1], [2]. Despite the issuance of writs of execution, enforcement failed. Respondent Deputy Sheriff Trampe attempted to enforce an alias writ on June 28, 1993. He claimed that after turning over the property, the defendants, armed with a bolo, destroyed the fence and prohibited entry. Trampe decided to leave the premises to avoid "any untoward incident" [3], [4]. Subsequently, another alias writ was issued in September 1993. Respondent Deputy Sheriff Ubalde refused to implement it, citing instructions from Respondent Clerk of Court Tablizo. Tablizo explained that the presiding judge had verbally instructed him to hold the writ in abeyance pending the resolution of a motion to quash, which the court later formalized in an order [3], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Respondent Trampe is administratively liable for failure to enforce the writ.
2. W/N Respondents Tablizo and Ubalde are administratively liable for abuse of authority or malfeasance.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Respondent Trampe is guilty of abuse of authority and neglect of duty. The Court held that threats from defendants are no excuse for a sheriff to retreat and refuse to enforce a writ. Trampe should have requested assistance from law enforcement authorities or filed criminal complaints against those threatening him [6]. By merely leaving to avoid trouble, he showed a "lackadaisical attitude" and cowardice that erodes the public's faith in the judiciary [7], [8]. A sheriff must exert every effort to ensure the speedy execution of judgment [9]. Trampe was suspended for six (6) months without pay [10].

2. **NO.** Respondents Tablizo and Ubalde are absolved. Tablizo acted in good faith when he instructed Ubalde to desist from execution, as he was following the presiding judge's verbal orders regarding an unresolved motion to quash the writ. The court subsequently issued an order formally holding the writ in abeyance [11]. Ubalde merely acted in obedience to his superior's lawful instructions [5]. The complaint against them was dismissed [10].
