I. CAPTION
NEW DURAWOOD CO., INC. v. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. FELIX S. CABALLES, AS JUDGE, RTC OF ANTIPOLO, RIZAL, BRANCH 71, WILSON M. GAW, ORLANDO S. BONGAT, DURAWOOD CONSTRUCTION AND LUMBER SUPPLY CO., INC., G.R. No. 111732, February 20, 1996, 324 Phil. 109, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
A "Petition for Judicial Reconstitution" of lost owner’s duplicate Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs) was filed in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Antipolo purportedly by Petitioner New Durawood Co., Inc., represented by its Branch Manager, respondent Wilson Gaw. The petition was supported by an affidavit of loss executed by respondent Orlando Bongat. The RTC granted the petition, declaring the old owner's duplicates void and ordering the issuance of new ones. Consequently, new TCTs were issued in the name of respondent Durawood Construction and Lumber Supply, Inc.

Petitioner's Board Chairman, Dy Quim Pong, later discovered the cancellation of the titles. Petitioner asserted that the owner's duplicate certificates were never lost but were in Dy Quim Pong's actual custody. Petitioner filed a suit with the Court of Appeals (CA) to annul the RTC order, claiming lack of jurisdiction and fraud. The CA dismissed the petition, ruling that the fraud was not extrinsic and that Petitioner was estopped by the actions of its manager, Gaw. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the RTC had jurisdiction to order the issuance of new owner’s duplicate certificates of title.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the RTC lacked jurisdiction.

First, the Court clarified that **Section 109 of P.D. 1529** is the applicable law for the issuance of new owner’s duplicate certificates that are lost or destroyed, whereas R.A. No. 26 applies only to the reconstitution of lost *original* certificates on file with the Register of Deeds.

Second, applying the doctrine in *Demetriou v. Court of Appeals* and *Serra Serra v. Court of Appeals*, the Court ruled that if a certificate of title has not been lost but is in fact in the possession of another person, the reconstituted title is void and the court rendering the decision has not acquired jurisdiction. In this case, the owner's duplicate certificates were in the possession of Petitioner's chairman and were not "lost or destroyed." Thus, the RTC never acquired jurisdiction, and the newly issued duplicates are null and void. The Court also noted that Gaw lacked authority to file the petition, preventing estoppel from attaching.

The petition is **GRANTED**, the CA decision is **SET ASIDE**, and the RTC proceedings and respondent's TCTs are declared **NULL and VOID**.
