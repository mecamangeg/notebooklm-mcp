I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. JOSE R. HERNANDEZ, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 158, PASIG CITY AND SPOUSES VAN MUNSON Y NAVARRO AND REGINA MUNSON Y ANDRADE, G.R. No. 117209, February 9, 1996, 323 Phil. 606, Regalado, J.

II. FACTS
On March 10, 1994, private respondents Spouses Van and Regina Munson filed a petition to adopt the minor Kevin Earl Bartolome Moran [1]. In the same petition, they prayed for the change of the minor’s first name to "Aaron Joseph," the name by which he was baptized and known by his adoptive family [1]. Petitioner Republic of the Philippines opposed the joinder of the petition for adoption and the petition for change of name, arguing they should be conducted as separate proceedings [2]. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) granted the adoption and the change of name, ruling liberally that the strict observance of Rule 103 (Change of Name) was unnecessary as no rights were prejudiced [3], [4]. The Republic filed the present appeal by certiorari on pure questions of law [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a petition for adoption can be properly joined with a petition for the change of the adoptee's given name.
2. W/N the change of the adoptee's given name was based on a lawful ground.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A petition for adoption and a petition for change of name are two distinct special proceedings governed by different laws and rules [6]. Under Rule 103 of the Rules of Court, a petition for change of name is a proceeding *in rem* requiring strict compliance with jurisdictional requirements, including specific publication and residency rules, which are separate from those of adoption [7], [8]. The Court ruled that permissive joinder of causes of action under Section 5, Rule 2 is inapplicable because the two proceedings do not arise from the same relation nor do they involve common questions of law and fact [9]. Adoption focuses on the fitness of the adopters, while a change of name looks into the reasonableness of the grounds for the change [10].

2. **NO.** A change of name is a privilege, not a matter of right, and requires proper and reasonable cause [11]. The Court held that the use of a baptismal name or the fact that a child is known by a different name in the community is not a sufficient ground to authorize a change of the registered name [12], [13]. While adoption grants the adoptee the right to use the adopter's surname, it does not confer upon the adopter the license to change the adoptee’s registered Christian or first name [14]. The right to name a child belongs to the natural parents upon registration, and adoptive parents cannot rename the child based on sentimentality [15], [16].

The assailed order is **MODIFIED**. The adoption is affirmed, but the child shall be officially known as Kevin Earl Munson y Andrade [17].
