**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. IMELDA VILLANUEVA Y PAQUIRING, G.R. No. 116311, January 13, 1997, 323 Phil. 189, Mendoza, J.

**II. FACTS**
On July 1, 1993, at 9:00 A.M. in Intramuros, Manila, accused-appellant Imelda Villanueva asked her neighbor and friend of four years, complainant Jocelyn Gador-Silvestre, if she could carry the latter's eight-month-old son [1-3]. Jocelyn agreed but instructed Villanueva to stay within the vicinity [4]. Villanueva took the child to Escolta to check if a movie theater was open [5]. When she did not return immediately, Jocelyn and her mother-in-law, Erlinda Silvestre, searched for her [4]. Villanueva was found and arrested on Jones Bridge or in Escolta later that day [1, 6]. The Regional Trial Court of Manila convicted Villanueva of kidnapping and serious illegal detention under Art. 267 of the Revised Penal Code and sentenced her to *reclusion perpetua* [2, 7]. Villanueva appealed, contending she had no intent to detain the child [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the accused is guilty of kidnapping.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the RTC decision. The essence of the crime of kidnapping under Art. 267 of the Revised Penal Code is the actual deprivation of the victim’s liberty coupled with the intent of the accused to effect it [3]. In this case, there was no evidence that Villanueva intended to take custody of the child from his mother [3]. The accused had the mother's permission to take the child, and although she went beyond the immediate vicinity to Escolta, this did not constitute kidnapping given their close relationship as neighbors and friends [3]. Furthermore, the distance and time elapsed were insufficient to prove an intention to run away with the child [8]. The prosecution failed to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt [9].

Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is **REVERSED** and the accused-appellant is **ACQUITTED** on the ground of reasonable doubt [10].
