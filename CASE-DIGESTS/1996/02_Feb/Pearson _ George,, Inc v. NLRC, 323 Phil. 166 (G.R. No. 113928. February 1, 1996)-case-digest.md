I. CAPTION
PEARSON & GEORGE, (S.E. ASIA), INC. v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND LEOPOLDO LLORENTE, G.R. No. 113928, February 1, 1996, 323 Phil. 166, Davide, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
Private respondent Leopoldo Llorente was a stockholder and member of the Board of Directors of petitioner corporation [1]. In 1989, the Board elected him as Managing Director [1]. On January 29, 1990, he was preventively suspended for alleged anomalous transactions [2]. During the stockholders' meeting on March 5, 1990, Llorente was not re-elected as Director, and the position of Managing Director was subsequently abolished [3].

Llorente filed a complaint for illegal dismissal with the Labor Arbiter [4]. Petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing the case was an intra-corporate dispute under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) [4]. The Labor Arbiter denied the motion, ruling that Llorente was a line officer/employee, and declared the dismissal illegal, awarding backwages and damages [5, 6]. The NLRC affirmed the Labor Arbiter's decision [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the NLRC has jurisdiction over the complaint for illegal dismissal filed by the private respondent.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the controversy is an intra-corporate dispute falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the SEC (now the Regional Trial Courts under the Securities Regulation Code), not the NLRC [3].

The Court held that Llorente was not "dismissed" in the ordinary sense. He lost his position as Managing Director primarily because he was not re-elected as a Director, which is a prerequisite qualification for the office of Managing Director [3]. His failure to be re-elected and the subsequent abolition of the position are matters relating to the election of directors and officers [8]. Under Section 5(c) of P.D. No. 902-A, controversies in the election or appointment of directors, trustees, officers, or managers of corporations are intra-corporate in nature [9].

Consequently, the petition was **GRANTED**, and the decisions of the NLRC and Labor Arbiter were **ANNULLED and SET ASIDE** [10].
