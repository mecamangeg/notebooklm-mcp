I. CAPTION
ANGELITO PAGUIO AND MODESTO ROSARIO v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, REDGOLD BROKERAGE CORPORATION, AND SPOUSES RODRIGO DE GUIA AND CEFERINA DE GUIA, G.R. No. 116662, February 1, 1996, 323 Phil. 203, Kapunan, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Angelito Paguio and Modesto Rosario were stockholders and officers of respondent Redgold Brokerage Corporation. Following a conflict arising from petitioners' request for financial statements, they were allegedly demoted and transferred. They filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against respondent corporation and its owners, Spouses De Guia. Respondents claimed petitioners established competing businesses and abandoned their work.

The Labor Arbiter found the termination justified due to acts inimical to the corporation's interest but awarded P60,500.00 in separation pay and indemnity. On appeal, the NLRC dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that the case was an intra-corporate controversy falling under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that the NLRC abused its discretion by resolving the issue of jurisdiction *sua sponte*, as it was not raised by the parties on appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the NLRC may dismiss a case for lack of jurisdiction even if the issue was not raised on appeal.
2. W/N the SEC has jurisdiction over a complaint for illegal dismissal filed by corporate stockholders and officers.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the NLRC did not abuse its discretion. Jurisdiction is conferred by law and cannot be acquired through or waived by any act or omission of the parties. When the lack of jurisdiction is apparent on the face of the record, a court or tribunal may consider it *motu proprio*. Citing *Dy v. NLRC* [1], the Court emphasized that issues of jurisdiction are not subject to the whims of the parties.

2. **YES.** Under P.D. 902-A, Section 5(b) and (c), the SEC has original and exclusive jurisdiction over controversies arising out of intra-corporate relations and the election or appointment of officers [2, 3]. The Court held that a corporate officer's dismissal is always a corporate act and an intra-corporate controversy, even if the officer seeks remuneration or benefits [4]. Since petitioners were stockholders and officers demanding a financial audit, the dispute is clearly intra-corporate. The petition was DISMISSED.
