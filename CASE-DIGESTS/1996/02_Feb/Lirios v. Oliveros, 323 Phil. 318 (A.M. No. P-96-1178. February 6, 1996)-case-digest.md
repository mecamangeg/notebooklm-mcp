I. CAPTION
JUDGE ANICETO A. LIRIOS v. SALVADOR P. OLIVEROS, CLERK OF COURT, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, NAVAL, BILIRAN, A.M. No. P-96-1178, February 6, 1996, 323 Phil. 318, Bellosillo, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Judge Lirios charged Respondent Clerk of Court Oliveros with irregularities committed in the MTC of Naval, Biliran. Specifically, Oliveros failed to account for consignation deposits in Civil Cases Nos. 324 and 356 (totaling P49,500.00 in the latter), issuing only temporary receipts and keeping the funds in his personal vault [1, 2]. Additionally, Oliveros requisitioned office equipment from the Supreme Court without the Judge's consent and kept two stand fans at his home for an unreasonable period [1, 3]. An audit further revealed that Oliveros failed to remit Judiciary Development Fund (JDF) collections on time, remitting P42,566.00 only in December 1994 out of collections accumulated since May 1985 [4]. In his defense, Oliveros claimed he merely followed RTC practices regarding receipts, deposited funds only after audits, and was waiting for court staff to pick up the fans [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N respondent is guilty of grave misconduct for mishandling court funds and property.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court found the respondent's explanations unsatisfactory and indicative of whimsical and abusive conduct.

The respondent's admission that he kept collections in his vault and deposited them only after audits violates **Supreme Court Circular No. 13-92**, which mandates that all fiduciary collections (bail bonds, rental deposits, etc.) be deposited *immediately* upon receipt with an authorized government depository bank [6]. Furthermore, the undue delay in remitting JDF collections constitutes grave misfeasance, if not malversation of funds [3]. Regarding the equipment, keeping the stand fans at home suggests an intent to appropriate government property for personal use [3]. Emphasizing that public office is a public trust, the Court held respondent guilty of grave misconduct [7, 8].

ACCORDINGLY, respondent is imposed a FINE of P10,000.00 with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of similar acts will be dealt with more severely [8].
