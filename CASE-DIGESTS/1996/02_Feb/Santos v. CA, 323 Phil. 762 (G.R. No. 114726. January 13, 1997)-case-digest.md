I. CAPTION
ARTURO SANTOS, et al. v. COURT OF APPEALS, et al., G.R. No. 114726, January 13, 1997, 323 Phil. 762, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
In November 1992, the Municipality of Sta. Cruz, Laguna filed a complaint for unlawful detainer against petitioners Arturo Santos, et al. with the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Sta. Cruz, claiming ownership of the land. Petitioners asserted they had possessed the land in the concept of owner for over 50 years and questioned the MTC's jurisdiction due to the issue of ownership [1-3].

On June 24, 1993, the MTC ordered petitioners to vacate the premises and pay rentals. Petitioners filed a notice of appeal and a supersedeas bond. The MTC transmitted the records to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) [4]. On September 15, 1993, the RTC dismissed the appeal for failure to pay the corresponding appeal fee. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari alleging grave abuse of discretion, but the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the dismissal [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the failure to pay the appeal fee automatically results in the dismissal of an appeal from the Municipal Trial Court to the Regional Trial Court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** While Rule 141, Section 8 of the Revised Rules of Court requires the payment of an appeal fee, the non-payment thereof does not automatically result in dismissal [6, 7].

The Court held that under Section 20 of the Interim Rules and Guidelines implementing B.P. Blg. 129, the *only* requirement for perfecting an appeal from the MTC to the RTC is the filing of a notice of appeal within the reglementary period. Payment of the appeal fee is not a prerequisite for perfection [7, 8]. Citing *Fontanar v. Bonsubre*, the Court ruled that the failure to pay the appellate docket fee confers a discretionary, not mandatory, power to dismiss. This discretion must be exercised wisely and with a view to substantial justice [9, 10].

Given that petitioners raised substantial questions regarding ownership in the lower court, dismissing the appeal on technical grounds would be unjust. Petitioners should be given ample opportunity to pay the fee [11, 12].

The petition is **GRANTED**. The CA Decision is **REVERSED**, and the RTC is **DIRECTED** to reinstate the appeal upon payment of the fee within ten (10) days from finality of the decision [12].
