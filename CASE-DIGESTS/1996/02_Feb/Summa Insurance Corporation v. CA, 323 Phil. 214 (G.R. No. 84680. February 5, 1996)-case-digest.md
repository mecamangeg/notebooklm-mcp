I. CAPTION
SUMMA INSURANCE CORPORATION v. COURT OF APPEALS and METRO PORT SERVICE, INC., G.R. No. 84680, February 5, 1996, 323 Phil. 214, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
On November 22, 1981, the S/S "Galleon Sapphire" arrived at the South Harbor, Manila, carrying a shipment consigned to Caterpillar Far East Ltd. with Semirara Coal Corporation (Semirara) as the notify party [1]. The shipment, covered by marine insurance issued by petitioner Summa Insurance Corporation, was discharged into the custody of respondent Metro Port Service, Inc., the exclusive arrastre operator [1]. Three good-order cargo receipts were issued, signed by the ship’s checker and Metro Port's representative [1]. However, when Semirara inspected the shipment at its warehouse, it discovered that a bundle of PC 8 U blades was missing [2]. Metro Port issued a short-landed certificate claiming the bundle was missing upon receipt, but the trial court gave more credence to the cargo receipts signed by Metro Port's representative [2, 3].

Petitioner paid the consignee the invoice value of the lost shipment (P280,969.68) and filed a collection suit against the carrier and Metro Port [2, 4]. The RTC absolved the carrier but held Metro Port liable for the full invoice value [4, 5]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed Metro Port's liability but reduced the amount to P3,500.00 pursuant to the Management Contract [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the liability of the arrastre operator for the lost shipment is limited to P3,500.00 per package.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the appellate court's decision limiting the liability. The Court held that the relationship between the consignee and the arrastre operator is akin to that between a depositor and a warehouseman [7]. Section 1, Article VI of the Management Contract between Metro Port and the Bureau of Customs expressly limits the operator's liability to P3,500.00 per package "unless the value of the importation is otherwise specified or manifested or communicated in writing... together with the invoice value and supported by a certified packing list... before the discharge of the goods" [8].

Citing *Northern Motors, Inc. v. Prince Line*, the Court ruled that such a stipulation is valid and not arbitrary because the consignee has the option to hold the operator liable for the full value by specifying it and paying the corresponding higher arrastre charges [9]. In this case, the petitioner failed to prove by a preponderance of evidence that the consignee declared the actual invoice value and submitted the certified packing list to Metro Port *before* the discharge of the cargo, or that the appropriate higher fees were paid [10, 11]. Therefore, the limitation of liability under the contract applies [11].

The petition for review on certiorari was **DENIED** and the decision of the Court of Appeals was **AFFIRMED** [12].
