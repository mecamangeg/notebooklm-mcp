I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE PORTS AUTHORITY AND MANILA FLOATING SILO CORPORATION v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, MARINA PORT SERVICES, INC., et al., G.R. Nos. 115786-87, February 5, 1996, 323 Phil. 260, Romero, J.

II. FACTS
Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) granted Marina Port Services, Inc. (MPSI) the exclusive right to manage arrastre, container terminal handling, and stevedoring services at the South Harbor [1, 2]. Subsequently, PPA entered into a contract with Manila Floating Silo Corporation (MAFSICOR) to operate a floating bulk terminal as an interim facility to improve cargo handling efficiency [3, 4]. MPSI filed an action for declaratory relief with a prayer for preliminary injunction, claiming the MAFSICOR contract violated its exclusive rights [5]. Separate injunction suits were also filed by the labor union KAMADA and the Chamber of Customs Brokers [6, 7].

While the RTC (Judge Veridiano) initially denied MPSI's application for injunction, ruling the contracts were complementary [8], another RTC branch (Judge Bayhon) issued a restraining order in the Brokers' case [9]. Upon review, the Court of Appeals (CA) issued a writ of preliminary injunction against PPA and MAFSICOR, holding that MPSI's exclusive rights were infringed and that Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1818—which prohibits injunctions against government projects—did not apply because the project was merely being prevented from infringing on private contractual rights [10, 11]. PPA and MAFSICOR filed this petition.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals may issue a preliminary injunction against the implementation of the PPA-MAFSICOR contract despite P.D. No. 1818.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The prohibition under Section 1 of P.D. No. 1818 is absolute and expressly covers "stevedoring and arrastre contracts" alongside infrastructure and public utility projects [12, 13]. The statute mandates that no court shall have jurisdiction to issue any restraining order or preliminary injunction in such cases to prohibit any person or entity from proceeding with the execution of the project [12]. This prohibition applies regardless of whether the entity being enjoined is public or private, as long as the project serves the government's economic development goals [14].

Furthermore, PPA's decision to contract MAFSICOR was an exercise of administrative discretion and policy-making intended to improve port services [15]. Courts generally should not interfere with the judgment of administrative agencies regarding technical matters unless there is a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion, which was absent here [16, 17]. The operation of the floating terminal was found to augment rather than hamper port services; thus, enjoining it violated the purpose of P.D. No. 1818 [18].

The petition was GRANTED, the CA decision was REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the lower courts were ordered to proceed with trial on the merits [19].
