I. CAPTION
SPOUSES ROMULO AND SALLY EDUARTE v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS AND PEDRO CALAPINE (SUBSTITUTED BY ALEXANDER CALAPINE AND ARTEMIS CALAPINE), G.R. No. 105944, February 9, 1996, 323 Phil. 462, Francisco, J.

II. FACTS
Pedro Calapine was the registered owner of a parcel of land (OCT No. P-2129). In April 1984, he executed a deed donating one-half of the land to his niece, Helen Doria. Subsequently, in July 1984, another deed was purportedly executed by Pedro donating the *whole* parcel to Helen, resulting in the cancellation of Pedro’s title and the issuance of TCT No. T-23205 in Helen’s name. In 1988, Helen sold a portion of the land to Spouses Eduarte (Petitioners), who were issued TCT No. T-27434.

Pedro later filed a suit to revoke the donation and annul the sale, claiming his signature on the second deed was a forgery and that Helen was guilty of ingratitude. The RTC ruled in favor of Pedro, revoking the first donation, declaring the second deed and the subsequent sale to the Eduartes void, and ordering the cancellation of the Eduartes' title. The trial court held the Eduartes were buyers in bad faith. The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC, ruling that Helen committed an act of ingratitude by falsifying the document and that the Eduartes failed to exercise due diligence given the presence of occupants on the land.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the commission of falsification of a public document by the donee is an act of ingratitude sufficient to revoke a donation.
2. W/N the petitioners were purchasers in good faith whose title should be protected despite the vendor's title being secured through forgery.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that falsification of a deed of donation constitutes an act of ingratitude under Article 765 of the Civil Code. The Court rejected petitioners' argument that falsification is merely a crime against public interest and not against the donor. Citing Tolentino and Manresa, the Court explained that "all crimes which offend the donor show ingratitude and are causes for revocation." This includes crimes against the person, honor, or property of the donor. By falsifying Pedro’s signature, Helen committed an offense against the donor, justifying the revocation.

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the Eduartes were innocent purchasers for value. Although a forged deed is generally a nullity, it can become the root of a valid title if the certificate has already been transferred to the name of the forger and the land is subsequently sold to an innocent purchaser. The Court reiterated the "mirror doctrine," stating that where there is nothing on the certificate of title to indicate any cloud or vice, the purchaser is not required to explore further than what the Torrens Title indicates on its face [Philippine National Bank vs. Court of Appeals]. The mere fact that others possessed the land does not automatically defeat the rights of a holder of a registered Torrens title [Abad vs. Court of Appeals]. Since the Eduartes bought the land relying on Helen’s clean title and paid full price without knowledge of the fraud, their right must be respected.

The petition is **GRANTED**. The decision of the Court of Appeals is **MODIFIED**. The annulment of the deed of sale and the Eduartes' title is **REVERSED**, declaring their title valid. Helen Doria is ordered to pay damages to the private respondents instead.
