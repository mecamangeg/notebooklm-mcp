I. CAPTION
MA. LOURDES VALENZUELA v. COURT OF APPEALS, RICHARD LI AND ALEXANDER COMMERCIAL, INC., G.R. No. 115024 (consolidated with G.R. No. 117944), February 7, 1996, 323 Phil. 374, Kapunan, J.

II. FACTS
On June 24, 1990, at around 2:00 A.M., petitioner Ma. Lourdes Valenzuela was driving along Aurora Boulevard when she noticed a flat tire. She stopped at a lighted area, parked her car about 1 ½ feet from the sidewalk, switched on her emergency lights, and alighted to fix the tire [1]. While she was at the rear of her car, she was suddenly bumped by a Mitsubishi Lancer driven by respondent Richard Li and owned by respondent Alexander Commercial, Inc. [1]. Valenzuela was thrown against the windshield of Li’s car and her left leg was severed [1]. Li claimed he was driving at 55 kph and was temporarily blinded by an oncoming vehicle, causing him to instinctively swerve and hit Valenzuela’s car, which he alleged was improperly parked [2]. However, a witness testified that Li was driving very fast, zigzagging, and smelled of alcohol [3], [4].

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found Li guilty of gross negligence and held Alexander Commercial, Inc. jointly and severally liable [5]. It awarded actual, moral, and exemplary damages [5]-[6]. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed Li’s liability but absolved Alexander Commercial, Inc., reasoning that Li used the car for private purposes [7]. The CA also reduced the moral damages [7]. Both parties appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Valenzuela was guilty of contributory negligence.
2. W/N Alexander Commercial, Inc. is liable for the damages caused by its employee, Richard Li.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that Valenzuela was not guilty of contributory negligence. Applying the "emergency rule," an individual who suddenly finds themselves in a situation of danger is not guilty of negligence if they fail to undertake what may appear to be a better solution upon reflection [8]. Valenzuela reacted to a flat tire on a rainy night by stopping at a convenient, lighted place safely away from the main road to solicit help, which was the reasonable course of action under the circumstances [9]-[10]. In contrast, Li was found grossly negligent for driving at high speed on a slippery road while under the influence of alcohol, which was the proximate cause of the accident [11]-[12].

2. **YES.** Alexander Commercial, Inc. is jointly and severally liable. Under Article 2180 of the Civil Code, employers are liable for damages caused by their employees based on the principle of *bonus pater familias* (good father of a family), which requires diligence in the selection and supervision of employees [13]. The Court held that when a company provides a vehicle to a managerial employee for both business and personal use, it serves the company's business and goodwill [14]. Consequently, the company owes a duty to the public to ensure the employee is a responsible driver. Alexander Commercial, Inc. failed to prove it exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in entrusting the car to Li, as it did not demonstrate that it checked his driving proficiency or history [15].

The Supreme Court modified the decision of the Court of Appeals and **REINSTATED** the judgment of the Regional Trial Court, including the award of P1,000,000.00 in moral damages [16].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Vitug, J., filed a concurring opinion [17].
