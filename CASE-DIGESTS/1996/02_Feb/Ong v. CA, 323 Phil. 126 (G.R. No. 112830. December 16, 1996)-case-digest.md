I. CAPTION
JERRY ONG v. COURT OF APPEALS AND RURAL BANK OF OLONGAPO, INC., G.R. No. 112830, December 16, 1996, 323 Phil. 126, Bellosillo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Rural Bank of Olongapo, Inc. (RBO) mortgaged two parcels of land to petitioner Jerry Ong to guarantee the obligations of Omnibus Finance, Inc. [1, 2]. Ong extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage, obtained a Certificate of Sale on March 23, 1984, and registered it on July 16, 1985 [2, 3]. RBO failed to redeem the property, leading Ong to execute an Affidavit of Consolidation of Ownership, but he could not register the titles in his name because RBO retained the owner's duplicate TCTs [3, 4].

Meanwhile, the Central Bank placed RBO under liquidation on November 9, 1984, and the RTC of Olongapo City (Liquidation Court) assumed jurisdiction over the liquidation proceedings [5]. On February 5, 1991, Ong filed a separate action with the RTC of Quezon City to compel RBO to surrender the titles [1]. RBO moved to dismiss, arguing the Liquidation Court had exclusive jurisdiction [5]. The RTC denied the motion, ruling the properties were no longer RBO assets having been sold prior to liquidation [5]. The Court of Appeals reversed the RTC, holding that the Liquidation Court had jurisdiction over the claim [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the regular court (RTC Quezon City) has jurisdiction over a claim for surrender of titles against a bank undergoing liquidation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA, ruling that the Liquidation Court has exclusive jurisdiction. Section 29, Paragraph 3 of R.A. 265 (Central Bank Act) expressly provides that the liquidation court shall have jurisdiction to adjudicate "disputed claims" against the bank [8]. Citing *Hernandez v. Rural Bank of Lucena, Inc.*, the Court held that all claims against an insolvent bank, as far as lawful and practicable, should be filed in the liquidation proceeding to prevent multiplicity of actions and ensure orderliness [9].

The term "disputed claims" covers all claims, whether against the assets of the bank, for specific performance, or damages [7]. Furthermore, since the TCTs remained in RBO's name, the properties were still considered part of the insolvent bank's assets regarding third-party creditors; registration is the operative act to convey title [10, 11]. Thus, Ong's claim must be litigated in the liquidation court.

The petition was **DENIED**.
