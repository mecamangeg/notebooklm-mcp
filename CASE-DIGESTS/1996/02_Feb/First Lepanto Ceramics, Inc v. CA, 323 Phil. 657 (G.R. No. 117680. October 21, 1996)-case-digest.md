**I. CAPTION**
FIRST LEPANTO CERAMICS, INC. v. COURT OF APPEALS and MARIWASA MANUFACTURING, INC., G.R. No. 117680, October 21, 1996, 323 Phil. 657, Vitug, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner First Lepanto Ceramics, Inc. was registered with the Board of Investments (BOI) as a non-pioneer enterprise for the manufacture of "glazed floor tiles" [1]. Private respondent Mariwasa Manufacturing, Inc., a competitor, filed a complaint with the BOI alleging that petitioner violated its registration terms by using tax-free equipment to produce ceramic *wall* tiles [2]. The BOI fined petitioner but allowed it to apply for an amendment of its certificate to cover "ceramic tiles" [3].

While Mariwasa filed another complaint (BOI Case No. 92-004) regarding continued violations, the BOI approved petitioner's application for amendment (BOI Case No. 92-005) on December 10, 1992 [4, 5]. Mariwasa appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), arguing the approval was premature due to the pending violation case. The CA annulled the BOI's approval, reasoning that a finding of guilt in the violation case could lead to the cancellation of petitioner's registration [6]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of Appeals erred in annulling the BOI's approval of the registration amendment based on the pendency of a violation case against the petitioner.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CA and reinstated the BOI decision. The Court held that the CA's judgment was based on unacceptable conjecture that the pending violation case (BOI Case No. 92-004) would result in the cancellation of the petitioner's registration [6].

The Court emphasized that under **E.O. No. 226 (Omnibus Investments Code of 1987)**, the BOI has the discretion to impose penalties other than cancellation, even if a registrant is found to have infringed the terms of its registration [6]. The BOI is the expert agency tasked with evaluating investment projects, and its decision to allow the amendment was a policy decision to provide the petitioner with technical and market flexibility for exports [7]. Citing *Felipe Ysmael, Jr. & Co., Inc. v. Deputy Executive Secretary*, the Court reiterated that courts should not interfere in matters addressed to the sound discretion of government agencies entrusted with the regulation of activities requiring special technical knowledge [7, 8].

The petition was **GRANTED**, the CA decision was **REVERSED**, and the BOI decision was **REINSTATED** [8].
