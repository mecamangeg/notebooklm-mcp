I. CAPTION
MIRIAM DEFENSOR-SANTIAGO v. FIDEL VALDEZ RAMOS, P.E.T. Case No. 001, February 13, 1996, 323 Phil. 665, En Banc.

II. FACTS
Following the May 11, 1992 presidential elections, Miriam Defensor-Santiago filed an election protest against the proclaimed winner, Fidel V. Ramos, alleging widespread fraud and irregularities. During the pendency of the protest, Santiago filed a Certificate of Candidacy for Senator in the May 8, 1995 elections. She was subsequently elected, took her oath, and assumed office as a Senator on June 30, 1995. Thereafter, she filed a motion to dispense with the revision of ballots in the remaining precincts of her pilot areas. The Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET) deferred action on the motion and required the parties to submit memoranda on whether the protest was rendered moot and academic by Santiago's election and assumption of office as Senator. Santiago argued that the case was imbued with public interest and should proceed, citing *Sibulo vda. de De Mesa v. Mencias*. Ramos argued that by running for and assuming another office, she had abandoned the protest.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the election protest was rendered moot and academic by the Protestant’s election and assumption of office as Senator.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Tribunal ruled that the election protest was rendered moot and academic by its abandonment or withdrawal by the Protestant.

The Court held that Santiago's act of filing a certificate of candidacy for Senator, campaigning, and assuming the office constituted an abandonment of her protest. By seeking and holding the office of Senator, which has a six-year term (1995–2001), she entered into a political contract with the electorate that is inconsistent with her claim to the Presidency (a term ending in 1998). The Court distinguished this from *Moraleja v. Relova*, stating that while holding a temporary position might not constitute abandonment, assuming a permanent elected office with a term extending beyond the contested office does. The Protestant effectively abandoned her determination to protect the public interest regarding the 1992 election results. Furthermore, her motion to dispense with the revision of the remaining ballots and failure to manifest an intent to present further evidence confirmed her lack of intention to prosecute the case.

Consequently, the Tribunal **DISMISSED** the election protest and the counter-protest.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
*   **Padilla, J. (Concurring and Dissenting):** Concurred in the dismissal. He argued that the Protestant’s assumption of the Senate seat created a supervening fact rendering the protest moot. He emphasized that she cannot hold the Senate seat (expiring 2001) and simultaneously claim the Presidency (expiring 1998), as this would create a vacuum in the Senate or a conflict of duties.
*   **Puno, J. (Dissenting):** Argued that the protest should be decided on the merits because election contests are imbued with paramount public interest to determine the true choice of the electorate. He posited that abandonment requires specific intent, which was not proven, and that the waiver of revision was likely for expediency rather than withdrawal.
