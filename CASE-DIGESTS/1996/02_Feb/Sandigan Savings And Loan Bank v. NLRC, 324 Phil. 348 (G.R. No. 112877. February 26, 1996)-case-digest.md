I. CAPTION
SANDIGAN SAVINGS AND LOAN BANK, INC., AND SANDIGAN REALTY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND ANITA M. JAVIER, G.R. No. 112877, February 26, 1996, 324 Phil. 348, Hermosisima, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
Private respondent Anita Javier was a realty sales agent for petitioner Sandigan Realty from 1982 to 1986, paid on commission. In 1986, she was hired as a regular marketing collector for petitioner Sandigan Savings and Loan Bank by Angel Andan, president of both companies, while continuing as a commissioned agent for the Realty. On April 20, 1990, Andan verbally dismissed Javier, telling her not to report for work due to personal reasons involving a third party.

Javier filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. The Labor Arbiter ruled in her favor. The NLRC affirmed, holding both Sandigan Realty and Sandigan Bank liable for backwages and separation pay. The Bank admitted the dismissal but disputed the amount, while the Realty denied an employer-employee relationship with Javier.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Javier was a regular employee of Sandigan Realty.
2. W/N Javier is entitled to reinstatement and backwages from Sandigan Bank.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Javier was not an employee of Sandigan Realty; she was an independent contractor. Applying the "control test," the Court found that the Realty had no control over the means and methods by which Javier accomplished her work. She paid for her own expenses, worked at her own pleasure, was not subject to definite hours, and was paid purely on a commission basis (results-oriented). Absent the power of control, there is no employer-employee relationship. (Citing *Cosmopolitan Funeral Homes, Inc. v. Maalat* and *Sara v. Agarrado*). Consequently, she is not entitled to backwages or separation pay from the Realty.

2. **YES.** Javier is entitled to reinstatement and backwages, but with deductions. Under Article 279 of the Labor Code, an unjustly dismissed employee is entitled to reinstatement and full backwages. Separation pay is awarded only when reinstatement is no longer possible. Since there was no showing that reinstatement was impossible, the NLRC erred in awarding separation pay. Sandigan Bank is ordered to reinstate Javier and pay backwages computed from the time of dismissal (April 20, 1990) up to actual reinstatement. However, earnings derived elsewhere during the period of dismissal must be deducted from the backwages.

The petition is **GRANTED**. The NLRC resolutions are **MODIFIED**: Javier is declared a regular employee of the Bank only, and the Bank is ordered to reinstate her and pay backwages less earnings derived elsewhere.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Padilla, J.** (Concurring and Dissenting):
Concurred with the reinstatement and the reckoning period for backwages but dissented regarding the deduction of earnings elsewhere. He argued that R.A. 6715 amended Art. 279 to award "full backwages," which implies no deductions should be made for income earned during the dismissal period.
