I. CAPTION
CECILIA ZULUETA v. COURT OF APPEALS and ALFREDO MARTIN, G.R. No. 107383, December 9, 1996, 324 Phil. 63, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cecilia Zulueta is the wife of private respondent Dr. Alfredo Martin. On March 26, 1982, Zulueta forcibly entered her husband’s medical clinic and, without his consent, opened drawers and cabinets to seize 157 documents, including private correspondence with alleged paramours, diaries, and cancelled checks. She intended to use these as evidence in a case for legal separation and disqualification from medical practice against her husband. Dr. Martin filed an action for recovery of the documents and damages. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila ruled in favor of Dr. Martin, declaring him the exclusive owner of the documents, ordering their return, and enjoining Zulueta from using them as evidence. The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC decision. Zulueta appealed, arguing that a previous Supreme Court resolution in a related disbarment case implied the documents were admissible.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N documents seized by a wife from her husband’s private papers without his knowledge and consent are admissible in evidence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The documents are inadmissible. The Supreme Court emphasized that the constitutional injunction declaring "the privacy of communication and correspondence [to be] inviolable" applies to all persons, including spouses. The only exceptions are a lawful court order or when public safety or order requires otherwise, as prescribed by law. The fact that the petitioner is the wife of the aggrieved party does not justify the violation of this constitutional right. Consequently, evidence obtained in violation of this provision is inadmissible "for any purpose in any proceeding."

The Court clarified that the previous administrative case cited by the petitioner (regarding her lawyer's use of the documents) resulted in acquittal only because a Temporary Restraining Order was in effect at that specific time, not because the documents were inherently admissible.

The petition is DENIED, and the decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.
