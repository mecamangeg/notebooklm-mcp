I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SGT. JERRY BALANON, G.R. Nos. 85248-49, February 1, 1996, 323 Phil. 29, Bellosillo, J.

II. FACTS
On April 4, 1994, accused-appellant Sgt. Jerry Balanon wrote to the Supreme Court withdrawing his appeal in a murder case [1]. Ms. Barbara C. Lopez, Records Officer II, received this letter on April 28, 1994, and a subsequent letter on June 17, 1994 [2]. However, she failed to transmit these letters to the Agenda Division until October 26, 1994 [2]. By that time, the Court had already promulgated its decision on July 6, 1994, affirming Balanon's conviction [1]. Lopez explained that she repeatedly requested the *rollo* (case record) but failed to receive it, leading her to inadvertently file the letters in a folder for pleadings not requiring reporting [3]. The Clerk of Court reported that Lopez should have used a temporary *rollo* or transmitted the letters despite the *rollo's* unavailability [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Ms. Barbara C. Lopez is administratively liable for negligence for the delay in transmitting the appellant's letters.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court found Ms. Lopez liable for inordinate delay, displaying a lack of devotion to duty [5]. The Court held that if a *rollo* is unavailable due to causes not attributable to the officer, the pleading must be reported just the same using a temporary *rollo* [5]. Court employees are bound to judiciously manage their affairs and adopt measures to ensure efficiency, as they are vital to the confidence of the people in the judicial system [6].

Ms. Barbara C. Lopez is SUSPENDED for two (2) weeks without pay and STERNLY WARNED [7].
