I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CAYETANO OBAR, JR., G.R. No. 105688, February 7, 1996, 323 Phil. 354, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
On January 6, 1990, in Bato, Leyte, accused-appellant Cayetano Obar, Jr. allegedly entered the house of complainant Sofronia Jumadas, a married woman. The prosecution claimed Obar, armed with a scythe, threatened Sofronia, held her hands, and raped her after she tripped and fell. Obar denied the charge, claiming they were lovers who engaged in foreplay but did not consummate the act because he refused to give her money. The medical examination showed no external injuries except a neck contusion, and the examining doctor admitted he was only "50% sure" penetration occurred. The Regional Trial Court found Obar guilty of rape and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the guilt of the accused for the crime of rape was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the trial court's decision. In resolving rape cases, the evidence for conviction must be clear and convincing to overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence [1].

The Court found the prosecution's evidence insufficient for the following reasons:
1.  **Lack of Force/Intimidation:** The alleged use of force was negated by the physical evidence. The complainant’s blouse, allegedly torn, was not presented. The contusion on her neck was inconsistent with being held by hands and likely resulted from grating against the floor [2, 3].
2.  **Improbability:** It was physically improbable for the accused, a man of average build (5'4", 50 kg), to restrain the complainant, a hardy farmer's wife, with one hand while undressing her with the other, unless he possessed superior strength, which was not proven [4].
3.  **Conduct of Complainant:** Her failure to flee or shout for help despite opportunities (neighbors were nearby), and her lack of resistance—merely pleading for mercy and making odd remarks—were inconsistent with the behavior of a woman defending her virtue [5, 6].
4.  **Inconclusive Medical Evidence:** The medical expert testified he could not conclude with certainty that penetration occurred, characterizing his finding as an "educated guess" [7, 8].

Consequently, the decision of the Regional Trial Court was **REVERSED** and the appellant was **ACQUITTED** on the ground of reasonable doubt [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Davide, Jr., J. concurred in the result [9].
