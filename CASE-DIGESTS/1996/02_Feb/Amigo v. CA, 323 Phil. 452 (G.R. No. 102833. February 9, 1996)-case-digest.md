I. CAPTION
LOLITA AMIGO AND ESTELITA VDA. DE SALINAS v. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. AUGUSTO V. BREVA, and JESUS WEE ENG, G.R. No. 102833, February 9, 1996, 323 Phil. 452, Vitug, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Amigo and Salinas leased a lot in Davao City in 1961 from Mercedes Inigo. Inigo later sold the land to Juan Bosquit and private respondent Jesus Wee Eng. Following a deed of exchange with the City Government and a subsequent sale of Bosquit's share to Wee, Wee became the sole registered owner of the disputed lots under TCT No. T-53041 and TCT No. T-53042.

On July 22, 1977, Wee filed a complaint for recovery of real property against petitioners in the Court of First Instance (now RTC) of Davao. A court-appointed commissioner found that petitioners' houses encroached on Wee's lot and the road widening area. Wee amended his complaint to include abatement of nuisance. Petitioners filed an answer and an amended answer, arguing their houses were situated along the banks of Agdao Creek and not on Wee's property.

The trial court rendered a decision in 1983 ordering petitioners to vacate the premises and demolish the nuisance portions. Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), but the appeal was dismissed for failure to file an appeal brief. After the judgment became final and writs of execution and demolition were issued, petitioners filed a new action in the CA to annul the trial court's judgment, claiming the trial court lacked jurisdiction. The CA dismissed the petition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the subject matter.
2. W/N the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the persons of the petitioners.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Jurisdiction over the subject matter is conferred by law and determined by the allegations of the complaint. The Supreme Court held that it is of no consequence if the merits of the case later veer away from the claims. The suit was for the recovery of real property, an action clearly within the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court under the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980 (B.P. Blg. 129).

2. **YES.** Jurisdiction over the person is acquired by voluntary appearance or service of summons. The Court ruled that by filing an answer and an amended answer, petitioners deemed to have formally and effectively appeared before the lower court. Citing *Flores v. Zurbito*, the Court reiterated that voluntary appearance is a waiver of the necessity of formal notice. Furthermore, unlike subject matter jurisdiction, the issue of jurisdiction over the person must be seasonably raised (e.g., in a motion to dismiss). Petitioners failed to question it until after the judgment was rendered.

The petition is DENIED and the decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.
