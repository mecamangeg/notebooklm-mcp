I. CAPTION
METROLAB INDUSTRIES, INC. v. HONORABLE MA. NIEVES ROLDAN CONFESOR and METRO DRUG CORPORATION EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION-FEDERATION OF FREE WORKERS, G.R. No. 108855, November 18, 1996, 324 Phil. 416, Kapunan, J. [1-3]

II. FACTS
Following the expiration of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between Metrolab Industries, Inc. (Metrolab) and the Union on December 31, 1990, negotiations ended in a deadlock. The Union filed a notice of strike, prompting the Secretary of Labor to assume jurisdiction over the dispute pursuant to Article 263(g) of the Labor Code. The Secretary issued an assumption order enjoining any strike or lockout and directing both parties to "cease and desist from committing any and all acts that might exacerbate the situation." [4, 5]

During the pendency of the dispute, specifically on January 27, 1992, Metrolab laid off 94 rank-and-file employees. Metrolab argued this was a temporary exercise of management prerogative due to business losses. The Union opposed this, claiming it violated the injunction against exacerbating the dispute. [6, 7]

Secretary of Labor Ma. Nieves Roldan Confesor declared the layoff illegal and ordered reinstatement with backwages. Additionally, in resolving CBA issues, the Secretary ruled that executive secretaries were excluded from the "closed-shop" provision but not from the bargaining unit itself. Metrolab filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the Secretary committed grave abuse of discretion in declaring the layoff illegal and in including executive secretaries in the bargaining unit. [8-10]

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Secretary of Labor committed grave abuse of discretion in declaring the layoff of 94 employees illegal.
2. W/N executive secretaries should be excluded from the rank-and-file bargaining unit.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Secretary of Labor did not abuse her discretion; the layoff was illegal. While the Supreme Court recognizes management prerogatives, this privilege is not absolute and is subject to limitations found in law [11]. Under Article 263(g) of the Labor Code, the Secretary of Labor has the power to assume jurisdiction over labor disputes causing a strike or lockout in an industry indispensable to the national interest [12]. This power includes the authority to issue injunctions restraining disruptive acts. The Court upheld the Secretary's finding that the mass layoff, conducted while the parties were resolving a CBA deadlock, exacerbated the conflict by increasing tensions and diverting attention from the negotiations [13-15]. Furthermore, the Court rejected Metrolab's claim that the layoff was temporary, noting that the notices sent to employees implied a permanent severance of employment [16].

2. **YES.** Executive secretaries should be excluded from the bargaining unit. Executive secretaries are classified as confidential employees because they assist and act in a confidential capacity to persons who formulate management policies, giving them access to vital labor relations information [17, 18]. Relying on *Philips Industrial Development v. NLRC* and *Pier 8 Arrastre & Stevedoring Services, Inc. v. Roldan-Confesor*, the Court ruled that confidential employees are ineligible to join the rank-and-file union [18, 19]. Including them in the bargaining unit would create a conflict of interest and potential espionage, as they would be duty-bound to protect the employer's interest while simultaneously benefiting from the Union's actions [20, 21].

The petition is **PARTIALLY GRANTED**. The resolutions of the Secretary of Labor are **MODIFIED** to the extent that executive secretaries of Metrolab's General Manager and Management Committee members are excluded from the bargaining unit of the rank-and-file employees [22].
