I. CAPTION
MACARIO R. LOPEZ v. HON. NLRC COMMISSIONERS LOURDES C. JAVIER, IRENEO B. BERNARDO, ROGELIO I. RAYALA, LA UNION TRANSPORT COOP. AND/OR ALBERTO F. DY, G.R. No. 102874, January 22, 1996, 322 Phil. 70, Romero, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Macario R. Lopez, a managerial employee on probationary status, was dismissed by respondents La Union Transport Coop. and Alberto F. Dy for alleged falsification, neglect of duty, and abandonment. He filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. The Labor Arbiter ruled in his favor, awarding reinstatement and full backwages [1]. On appeal, the NLRC affirmed the illegal dismissal but modified the judgment by deleting the award of damages and limiting backwages to three months, reasoning that as a probationary employee, his tenure would have been limited to that period [1]. Lopez petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing he is entitled to full backwages beyond the probationary period [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a probationary employee who is illegally dismissed is entitled to full backwages beyond the probationary period.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to moral damages and attorney's fees.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Probationary employees enjoy security of tenure under Article 281 of the Labor Code and may only be terminated for just cause or failure to qualify [2]. When illegally dismissed, Article 279 (as amended by R.A. No. 6715) mandates "full backwages" computed from the time compensation was withheld up to actual reinstatement [2]. The Court held that limiting backwages to the probationary period is erroneous. However, since reinstatement was not feasible due to strained relations and his managerial position, separation pay was awarded in lieu of reinstatement, and backwages were computed until the finality of the decision [2]. Notably, the Court applied the rule in *Pines City Educational Center v. NLRC*, requiring the deduction of income earned by the petitioner elsewhere during the dismissal period to prevent unjust enrichment [2, 3].

2. **NO.** Moral damages are recoverable only if the dismissal was attended by bad faith, fraud, or oppression, or was contrary to morals and public policy [3]. The Court found no evidence of such bad faith by the respondents, despite the illegality of the dismissal. Consequently, the claim for attorney's fees was also denied pursuant to Article 2208 of the Civil Code [3].

The petition was **GRANTED** in part, and the NLRC decision was **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that respondents pay full backwages from the time of dismissal up to the finality of the decision, subject to the deduction of income earned elsewhere [3].
