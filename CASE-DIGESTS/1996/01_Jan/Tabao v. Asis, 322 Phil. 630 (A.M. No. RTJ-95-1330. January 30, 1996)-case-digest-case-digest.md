I. CAPTION
AZUCENA CINCO TABAO AND JESUSA CINCO ACOSTA v. JUDGE ENRIQUE C. ASIS, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BR. 10, ABUYOG, LEYTE, A.M. No. RTJ-95-1330, January 30, 1996, 322 Phil. 630, Bellosillo, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Complainants charged respondent Judge Enrique C. Asis with notarizing a private Special Power of Attorney (SPA) [2]. The respondent admitted to the act but interposed the defense that he did so out of "Christian charity" [2]. The notarization took place in Tacloban City, an area that abounds with commissioned notaries public [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N respondent Judge is administratively liable for notarizing a private Special Power of Attorney. [2]

IV. RULING
**YES.** Judges are generally prohibited from engaging in the private practice of law, which includes notarizing private documents, to ensure their full time is devoted to their judicial duties [2]. Under Section 35, Rule 138 of the Revised Rules of Court and Canon 5, Rule 5.07 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, municipal judges may only act as notaries public *ex-officio* in matters connected to their official functions [2]. An exception exists for judges assigned to far-flung municipalities lacking lawyers or notaries public, provided the fees are turned over to the government [2]. Since Tacloban City has ample notaries public, the respondent did not qualify for this exception, and his defense of "Christian charity" was deemed invalid [2]. Accordingly, the respondent is found administratively liable.
