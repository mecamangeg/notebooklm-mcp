I. CAPTION
GIL RUBIO v. THE HON. MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT IN CITIES, BRANCH 4, CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, CITY SHERIFF OF CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, AND SPOUSES LIM LIONG KANG AND LIM PUE KING, G.R. No. 87110, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 179, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Gil Rubio was the defendant in an ejectment case filed by private respondents Spouses Lim regarding a parcel of land in Cagayan de Oro City [1, 2]. On September 18, 1985, the MTCC rendered a decision ordering Rubio to vacate and pay rentals [3]. The dispositive portion stated that execution would issue immediately, except for the order to vacate, which would issue "after six (6) months from and after receipt by defendant of this decision, unless an appeal has been perfected" [3].

Rubio appealed to the RTC and subsequently the Court of Appeals (CA), both of which affirmed the MTCC decision (with modification on rental amounts by the CA) [4, 5]. The CA decision became final and executory, and records were remanded to the MTCC in December 1988 [5, 6]. Respondents moved for an Order of Demolition, which the MTCC granted. A "Writ of Demolition" was issued on February 2, 1989, and enforced on February 20, 1989 [7].

Rubio filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that: (1) under the MTCC decision, he had a six-month grace period reckoned from the remand of records, making the execution premature [6]; (2) no "Writ of Execution" was issued prior to the "Writ of Demolition" [8]; and (3) a separate RTC decision declaring respondents as buyers in bad faith constituted a supervening event that should suspend execution [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the execution of the judgment was premature due to the six-month period stated in the MTCC decision.
2. W/N the "Writ of Demolition" was valid despite the absence of a prior "Writ of Execution."
3. W/N the pendency of a separate case involving ownership suspends the execution of the ejectment judgment.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The six-month period stipulated in the decision was a grace period intended to suspend execution only if the defendant did not appeal. The phrase "unless an appeal has been perfected" meant that perfecting an appeal rendered the six-month period inoperative [10, 11]. By appealing, Rubio extended his possession for over three years, effectively availing himself of more than the granted grace period [11]. Furthermore, the period was reckoned from the defendant's receipt of the *original* MTCC decision, not from the finality of the appellate judgment [8].

2. **YES.** While denominated as a "Writ of Demolition," the writ substantially complied with the form and contents of a writ of execution as provided under Section 8, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court [12]. It was issued in the name of the Republic, referred to the specific judgment, stated the amount due, and required the sheriff to deliver possession [12]. The Rules of Court are liberally construed to assist parties in obtaining a just and speedy determination of actions [12].

3. **NO.** The pendency of an action for reconveyance (ownership) does not divest the lower court of jurisdiction to enforce a judgment in an unlawful detainer case, which involves only material possession (*Ang Ping v. Regional Trial Court of Manila*) [13]. Ejectment actions can lie even against the owner [14]. Moreover, the separate decision regarding ownership was not yet final and executory when the demolition occurred and thus could not serve to stay the execution [15].

The petition is **DISMISSED** for lack of merit [14].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Davide, Jr., J.** (Separate Opinion): Voted to dismiss the petition for being a dilatory scheme and clearly moot, as the demolition had already been fully implemented before the petition was filed [16].
