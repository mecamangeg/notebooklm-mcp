I. CAPTION
SENATOR HEHERSON T. ALVAREZ, ET AL. v. HON. TEOFISTO T. GUINGONA, JR., ET AL., G.R. No. 118303, February 10, 1997, 322 Phil. 774, Hermosisima, Jr., J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioners, composed of Senators and other officials, filed a Petition for Prohibition assailing the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 7720, which converted the Municipality of Santiago, Isabela into an Independent Component City [2]. They argued that the municipality failed to meet the required P20,000,000.00 average annual income because the computation improperly included Internal Revenue Allotments (IRAs) [2]. Furthermore, Petitioners claimed the Act was unconstitutional because it did not originate exclusively in the House of Representatives as required by Article VI, Section 24 of the Constitution, noting that a counterpart Senate Bill (SB No. 1243) was filed and passed [2]. The procedural history showed that House Bill No. 8817 was filed first on April 18, 1993, passed by the House, and transmitted to the Senate, which had waited to act on its own version until receiving the House Bill [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N R.A. No. 7720 is unconstitutional for failing to originate exclusively in the House of Representatives.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the enactment complied with the Constitution because House Bill No. 8817 was filed in the House first (April 18, 1993) before Senate Bill No. 1243 was filed in the Senate (May 19, 1993), meaning the House Bill initiated the legislative process [3]. Citing *Tolentino v. Secretary of Finance*, the Court reiterated that the Constitution does not prohibit the filing of a substitute bill in the Senate in anticipation of the House bill, provided the Senate withholds action until it receives the House bill [3]. Here, the Senate properly waited for the transmittal of the approved House Bill before acting on its own version [3].

The petition is **DISMISSED** for lack of merit [4].
