I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ELISA MIRANDA Y DORIA, G.R. No. 117415, January 31, 1996, 322 Phil. 772, Bellosillo, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Atty. Tomas P. Evangelista, counsel *de parte* for the accused-appellant, failed to file the appellant's brief by the prescribed deadline of May 27, 1995 [1]. Consequently, the Supreme Court initially dismissed the appeal, though it was later reinstated to provide the accused an opportunity to prove her innocence [1]. In his explanation to the Court, Atty. Evangelista stated that he failed to file the brief because he assumed he had been relieved as counsel, noting that the accused's father never returned to confer with him or submit the necessary transcript of stenographic notes [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Atty. Evangelista's failure to file the appellant's brief is excusable based on his assumption that he had been relieved as counsel.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court found the counsel's inaction to warrant a penalty. Accordingly, the Court imposed a fine of P500.00 on Atty. Evangelista and warned that a repetition of the act would be dealt with more severely [2].
