I. CAPTION
EMILIA B. HERNANDEZ vs. JUDGE SALVADOR P. DE GUZMAN, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 142, MAKATI CITY, A.M. No. RTJ-93-1064, January 22, 1996, 322 Phil. 65, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Emilia B. Hernandez was the complainant in a criminal case for illegal recruitment titled "People vs. Yadollah Sichani," presided over by respondent Judge De Guzman. After trial, the Judge convicted the accused but only awarded Hernandez P5,000.00 in indemnity. Dissatisfied, Hernandez filed an administrative complaint against the Judge for bias and undue delay, alleging the proceedings took four years and the award was unfair. The Judge contended the delay was attributable to Hernandez, who repeatedly sought postponements to present NAIA guards as witnesses. He further claimed the promulgation was delayed because Hernandez frequently assured court staff that the witnesses had agreed to testify if the case were reopened.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent Judge is administratively liable for undue delay in rendering judgment.
2. W/N the propriety of the indemnity award is a valid subject of an administrative complaint.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court found the respondent Judge liable for delay. Under Circular No. 1 dated January 28, 1988, judges must adopt a strict policy on postponements and faithfully adhere to Rule 22 of the Rules of Court to avoid delays. The case was submitted for decision on May 28, 1992, yet the judgment was dated February 23, 1993, constituting a delay of over six months beyond the mandated period. The Court emphasized that a judge must remain in full control of the proceedings and should not delay the promulgation of judgment based on "flimsy" hearsay information that a party desires to present additional witnesses.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the grant of indemnity is judicial in nature. An administrative complaint is not the proper forum to question the propriety of a decision or order perceived to be unjust or unreasonable. The complainant should have resorted to available legal remedies, such as an appeal, to question the award.

**Accordingly, the respondent Judge is imposed a FINE of P5,000.00 with a STERN WARNING.**
