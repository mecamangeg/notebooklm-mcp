I. CAPTION
**DR. ANTONIO L. AZORES v. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND PHILIPPINE COLUMBIAN ASSOCIATION, G.R. No. 112337, September 23, 1996, 322 Phil. 425, Mendoza, J.**

II. FACTS
Petitioner Antonio Azores was a member of respondent Philippine Columbian Association (PCA). In 1966, he moved to the United States and became an American citizen, ceasing his payment of membership dues [1, 2]. Upon his return to the Philippines in 1981, he sought to reactivate his membership. The PCA Board insisted he pay back dues for the years of his absence [3, 4]. Azores objected and filed a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1991 [5].

The SEC Hearing Officer rendered a decision sustaining the PCA. Azores filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied. Based on the remaining period to appeal after the denial of his motion, the 30th and last day to file his appeal fell on October 17, 1992, a Saturday. Azores filed his Notice and Memorandum of Appeal on October 20, 1992 (a Tuesday) [6]. The appeal was dismissed for being filed out of time. Azores filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that Saturday and Sunday should not be counted and that his delay was excusable [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the SEC gravely abused its discretion in dismissing the appeal for being filed out of time.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the deadline for the appeal was mandatory. The Court rejected the petitioner's argument that the Saturday deadline should be moved to the next working day, citing *Atlas Cons. Mining and Dev. Corp. v. Factoran*, which held that Saturdays are not holidays that may be pretermitted [8]. Even assuming the deadline extended to the next working day (Monday, October 19), the petitioner filed his appeal on Tuesday, October 20, without valid justification [9].

The failure to perfect an appeal within the statutory period renders the decision final and unappealable. While exceptions exist for "gross miscarriage of justice," none applied here. Furthermore, on the merits, the SEC committed no error; the PCA by-laws restrict membership to Filipino citizens and allow termination for non-payment of dues, providing a reasonable basis for the Hearing Officer's decision [10].

The petition is **DISMISSED**.
