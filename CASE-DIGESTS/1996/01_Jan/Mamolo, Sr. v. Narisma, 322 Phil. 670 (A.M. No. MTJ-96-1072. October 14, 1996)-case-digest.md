**I. CAPTION**
DANIEL MAMOLO, SR. v. JUDGE ROGELIO R. NARISMA, A.M. No. MTJ-96-1072, October 14, 1996, 322 Phil. 670, Bellosillo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Complainant Daniel Mamolo, Sr. charged respondent Judge Narisma of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC), Bansalan-Magsaysay, Davao del Sur, with irregularity in granting bail to Antonio Balagot, who was accused of murder (a capital offense) [1, 2]. Although the Judge initially recommended no bail, he subsequently granted Balagot’s petition for admission to bail fixed at P150,000.00 during a hearing on May 25, 1994 [3, 4]. The complainant alleged that the Judge granted bail without giving the prosecution an opportunity to present evidence to prove that the guilt of the accused was strong [4]. The respondent Judge claimed he conducted a hearing where the prosecutor submitted the resolution of the petition to the sound discretion of the court and did not file an opposition [5]. However, the transcript of stenographic notes revealed that only the amount of bail was discussed, and no questions were propounded by the Judge to verify the strength of the prosecution's evidence [6, 7]. The Office of the Court Administrator found that the respondent disregarded procedural due process [8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the respondent Judge is administratively liable for gross ignorance of the law for granting bail in a capital offense without a hearing on the strength of the evidence.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that the respondent Judge’s failure to adhere to fundamental procedure constitutes gross ignorance of the law [9]. In a bail hearing, the judge is under legal obligation to receive evidence to determine if the evidence of guilt is strong enough to warrant the denial of bail (*Payao v. Lesaca*) [7]. Even if the prosecution refuses to adduce evidence or submits the motion to the sound discretion of the court, the court must still ask questions to ascertain the strength of the state's evidence (*Borinaga v. Tamin*) [10]. The Judge failed to perform this peremptory duty, depriving the prosecution of procedural due process [9, 11].

Accordingly, Judge Rogelio R. Narisma is **FINED** P20,000.00 with a **STERN WARNING** regarding the commission of similar offenses [12].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Padilla, Vitug, Kapunan, and Hermosisima, Jr. concurred with the decision [13].
