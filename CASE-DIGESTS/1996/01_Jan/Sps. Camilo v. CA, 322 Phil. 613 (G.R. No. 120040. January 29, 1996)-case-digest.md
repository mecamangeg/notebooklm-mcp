I. CAPTION
SPS. CAMILO Y. GO AND DELIA L. GO v. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. MARCELINO F. BAUTISTA, JR. AND MANUELA REALTY DEVELOPMENT CORP., G.R. No. 120040, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 613, Francisco, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Spouses Go mortgaged their house and lot to respondent Manuela Realty Development Corp. (Manuela) to secure a loan of P93,200.00 [1]. Manuela extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage due to petitioners' alleged failure to pay, purchased the property at public auction, and consolidated ownership [1]. Petitioners filed a case and subsequently moved for summary judgment, arguing there was no genuine issue as to any material fact [2, 3]. The trial court denied the motion. Petitioners filed a petition for mandamus with the Court of Appeals (CA) to compel the trial court to render summary judgment [2]. The CA dismissed the petition, ruling that genuine triable issues of fact existed, such as the amount actually paid, the existence of default, and the validity of the foreclosure, which required a full trial [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may be compelled by mandamus to render summary judgment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** Mandamus lies to compel the performance of a ministerial duty, but not a discretionary one [6]. The propriety of rendering a summary judgment under Rule 34 of the Rules of Court rests on the sound exercise of the court's discretion [6]. Petitioners failed to show a clear legal right to the relief sought or that the trial court had a mandatory duty to grant the motion [6]. Furthermore, summary judgment is proper only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law [3]. Here, the pleadings showed substantial factual disputes regarding payments made and the alleged default, which can only be resolved after a trial on the merits [4, 5]. The burden is on the movant to demonstrate the absence of genuine issues, which petitioners failed to do [5].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED [7].
