I. CAPTION
BIENVENIDO VELARMA v. COURT OF APPEALS AND JOSEFINA PANSACOLA, G.R. No. 113615, January 25, 1996, 322 Phil. 435, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondent Josefina Pansacola is the registered owner of a parcel of land in Mauban, Quezon, covered by TCT No. T-91037 [1]. In May 1981, petitioner Bienvenido Velarma surreptitiously constructed a dwelling on the property and refused to vacate despite interventions and a conviction for violating the Anti-Squatting Law [1]. Pansacola filed an ejectment suit before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) [1]. Velarma argued that Pansacola had no cause of action because the land had been exchanged with the government [2]. He relied on the "Minutes of the Meeting of the Sangguniang Bayan of Mauban" dated November 5, 1974, where Pansacola's late husband agreed to exchange the portion traversed by a new highway for an abandoned provincial road [2]. The RTC ruled in favor of Pansacola, finding that no deed was executed to perfect the exchange. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision *in toto* [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the minutes of a Sangguniang Bayan meeting regarding a property exchange, absent a formal deed, are sufficient to transfer ownership.
2. W/N the petitioner is barred from questioning the RTC's jurisdiction over the ejectment suit.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the minutes of the meeting merely signified an agreement to transfer but did not effect a conveyance [3]. There was no evidence that a survey was actually undertaken or that a specific portion of the abandoned road was partitioned and conveyed to the Pansacolas [3]. The Court emphasized that unless and until the transfer is consummated, or expropriation proceedings are instituted, the registered owner retains ownership of the land [3].

2. **YES.** Although the ejectment suit should have been filed with the Municipal Trial Court, the Court ruled that the petitioner was barred by estoppel by laches from questioning the RTC's jurisdiction [4]. The petitioner had raised the issue of ownership and participated in the trial without moving to dismiss the case [4].

The petition is DENIED [4].
