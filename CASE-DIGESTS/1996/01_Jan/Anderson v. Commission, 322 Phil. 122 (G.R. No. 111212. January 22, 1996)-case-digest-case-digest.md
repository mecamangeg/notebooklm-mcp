I. CAPTION
GEORGE ANDERSON v. THE LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, PACIFIC BUSINESS VENTURES INC., AND KAMAL AL BITAR, G.R. No. 111212, January 22, 1996, 322 Phil. 122, Mendoza, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioner George Anderson filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. The POEA ruled in his favor, ordering respondents to pay his salaries for the unexpired portion of the contract and salary differentials [2]. Respondents appealed to the NLRC and, in a second supplemental appeal memorandum, submitted an affidavit by respondent Bitar claiming Anderson lacked leadership and technical know-how [2]. This affidavit was served directly on Anderson, not on his counsel of record [2]. The NLRC reversed the POEA decision and dismissed the complaint, relying on Anderson's failure to refute the allegations in Bitar's affidavit [2]. Anderson argued he could not answer the affidavit because it was not served on his counsel, preventing him from seeking legal advice [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner was illegally dismissed based on the affidavit submitted by the respondents. [3]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner was illegally dismissed. Loss of confidence, while a just cause for termination, must be based on substantial evidence [3]. The Court found the affidavit submitted by the respondent contained only "general, vague and amorphous allegations" of unfitness without citing specific acts or omissions [3].

Furthermore, the NLRC gravely abused its discretion by relying on the petitioner's failure to answer the affidavit. The affidavit was served directly on the petitioner rather than his counsel, violating Rule III, Section 3 of the NLRC Rules of Procedure, which mandates service on counsel if a party is represented [3]. Consequently, the petitioner is entitled to his salary for the unexpired portion of his contract (15 months) and salary differentials based on the correct monthly rate of US$525.00 [4].

The decision of the NLRC is SET ASIDE and that of the POEA Administrator is REINSTATED with the MODIFICATION that petitioner should be paid the additional amount of US$205.00 representing the difference between the amount paid as termination pay and his actual monthly salary [4].
