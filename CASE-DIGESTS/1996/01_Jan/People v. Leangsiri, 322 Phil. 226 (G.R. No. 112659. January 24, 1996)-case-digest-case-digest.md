**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SUCHINDA LEANGSIRI (AT LARGE), FATI OMOGBOLAHAN Y ALABI, YAMBA LISASI BHOLA, AND ZARIATU AMIDU, G.R. No. 112659, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 226, Puno, J.

**II. FACTS**
On May 31, 1993, Suchinda Leangsiri was arrested at NAIA for bringing in 8,225.31 grams of heroin. He agreed to cooperate with NARCOM agents in a follow-up operation to identify his contacts. He was brought to Room 504 of the Las Palmas Hotel to wait for the pick-up. At the hotel lobby, appellant Zariatu Amidu was observed signaling "thumbs up" to appellants Fati Omogbolahan and Yamba Lisasi Bhola upon their arrival. The three appellants proceeded to Room 504, examined the heroin shown by Leangsiri, took possession of the suitcase containing the drugs, and attempted to leave. NARCOM agents hiding in the washroom arrested them *in flagrante delicto*. Agents subsequently conducted a warrantless search of Amidu's separate room (Room 413), seizing a note with Leangsiri's name. The Regional Trial Court convicted appellants of violating Section 4, Article II of R.A. No. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act) for conspiring to transport heroin. Appellants moved for a new trial based on "newly discovered evidence," which the trial court denied.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N there was a conspiracy among the appellants to transport the prohibited drug.
2. W/N the appellants are liable for "transporting" the drug despite the interruption of the act.
3. W/N the evidence seized from Amidu's separate room (Room 413) via warrantless search is admissible.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** Conspiracy was established by the appellants' concerted acts aimed at the common objective. Amidu waited in the lobby and signaled the others; all three went to Room 504 together; and they examined and took possession of the heroin [1]. The act of one is the act of all.

2. **YES.** Section 4 of R.A. No. 6425 penalizes the act of "transporting," defined as "to carry or convey from one place to another." The fact that there is actual conveyance suffices to support a conviction, regardless of whether the destination is reached. Citing *People v. Lo Ho Wing*, the Court held that the act of transporting had already commenced when appellants took possession of the heroin and attempted to leave the room. An interrupted transport is still a violation [2].

3. **NO.** The warrantless search of Amidu's Room 413 was illegal because it was not conducted incidental to the lawful arrest made in Room 504. A search incidental to a lawful arrest must be confined to the person of the accused and the area within their immediate control. Room 413 was distinct and separate from the place of arrest. Consequently, the note found therein is inadmissible. However, the remaining evidence was sufficient to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt [2].

The Decision of the RTC of Manila is **AFFIRMED**.
