I. CAPTION
EMILIA B. HERNANDEZ v. JUDGE SALVADOR P. DE GUZMAN, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 142, MAKATI CITY, A.M. No. RTJ-93-1064, January 22, 1996, 322 Phil. 65, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Emilia B. Hernandez filed an administrative complaint against Respondent Judge Salvador P. De Guzman for bias and undue delay in resolving Criminal Case No. 89-1198 (*People v. Sichani*) for illegal recruitment [1]. The case was received by the trial court in March 1989 and deemed submitted for resolution on May 28, 1992 [1]. However, the decision convicting the accused was only dated February 23, 1993, and its actual promulgation was further delayed [1]. Hernandez also claimed the P5,000.00 indemnity awarded to her was unfair [1]. Respondent Judge argued the delay was attributable to Hernandez, who frequently requested postponements to present NAIA guards as witnesses, and that the indemnity was based on a POEA order [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent Judge is administratively liable for undue delay in rendering judgment [2].

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the Judge is liable for the delay. While some delay was attributable to the complainant, the Judge should not have allowed frequent postponements [2]. Circular No. 1 (January 28, 1988) requires judges to adopt a strict policy on postponements to avoid delays, mandating faithful adherence to Sections 3, 4, and 5 of Rule 22 of the Rules of Court [2]. Since the case was submitted for decision on May 28, 1992, it should have been decided by August 1992 [2]. The Judge's reliance on hearsay information that the complainant wanted to present additional witnesses did not justify the delay in the preparation and promulgation of the judgment [2].
