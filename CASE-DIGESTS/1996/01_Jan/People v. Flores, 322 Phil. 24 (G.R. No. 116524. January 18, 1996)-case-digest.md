I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LYNDON FLORES Y MALARAYAP, G.R. No. 116524, January 18, 1996, 322 Phil. 24, Melo, J.

II. FACTS
On June 20, 1993, in Boac, Marinduque, Manuel Lazarte was lying dead drunk and unconscious on the pavement. Accused Lyndon Flores, who was angry following an altercation with Lazarte's mother regarding a pawned cassette recorder, approached the helpless Lazarte and kicked him violently in the stomach and chest using leather shoes. Witnesses saw the assault. Lazarte suffered ruptured intestines and died two days later. The trial court convicted Flores of Murder, finding the attack was qualified by treachery, and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*. Flores appealed, arguing he merely nudged the victim to wake him up and that the crime should only be Homicide [1-6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused is guilty of Murder.
2. W/N the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* was correctly imposed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The accused is guilty of Murder. Under Art. 4(1) of the Revised Penal Code, a person is criminally liable for a felony although the wrongful act done be different from that intended. The medical evidence of ruptured intestines contradicted the accused's claim of merely "nudging" the victim. The crime is Murder because the assault was qualified by treachery, as the victim was dead drunk and unconscious, rendering him unable to defend himself [7, 8].

2. **NO.** The trial court erred in imposing *reclusion perpetua*. The Court appreciated the mitigating circumstance of lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong (Art. 13, par. 3, RPC) because Flores only intended to inflict injuries, not to kill. Since the crime occurred before R.A. 7659, the applicable penalty for Murder was *reclusion temporal* in its maximum period to death. With one mitigating circumstance and no aggravating circumstances, the penalty is the minimum period (*reclusion temporal* maximum). Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the decision is **AFFIRMED** with **MODIFICATION**, sentencing the accused to an indeterminate term of 10 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* as minimum, to 17 years, 4 months, and 1 day of *reclusion temporal* as maximum [9, 10].
