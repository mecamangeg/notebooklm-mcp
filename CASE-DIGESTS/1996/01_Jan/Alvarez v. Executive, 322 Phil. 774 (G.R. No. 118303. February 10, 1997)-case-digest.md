I. CAPTION
SENATOR HEHERSON T. ALVAREZ, et al. v. HON. TEOFISTO T. GUINGONA, JR., et al., G.R. No. 118303, February 10, 1997, 322 Phil. 774, Hermosisima, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, including Senators Alvarez and Lina, filed a Petition for Prohibition challenging the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 7720, which converted the Municipality of Santiago, Isabela into an Independent Component City. They argued that the municipality failed to meet the income requirement of P20,000,000.00 under Section 450 of the Local Government Code (LGC) because Internal Revenue Allotments (IRAs) should be excluded from the computation. Additionally, they contended that the Act did not originate exclusively in the House of Representatives as required by Art. VI, Sec. 24 of the Constitution, noting that the Senate passed its own version (S.B. No. 1243).

Procedurally, House Bill No. 8817 was filed first in the House on April 18, 1993. A counterpart Senate Bill No. 1243 was filed later on May 19, 1993. The House passed H.B. No. 8817 on December 17, 1993, and transmitted it to the Senate. The Senate Committee subsequently reported out H.B. No. 8817 (taking into consideration S.B. No. 1243), which was then approved by the Senate. The President signed the bill into law, and it was ratified in a plebiscite.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Internal Revenue Allotments (IRAs) should be included in the computation of the average annual income of a municipality for purposes of conversion into a city.
2. W/N R.A. No. 7720 violates the constitutional requirement that bills of local application must originate exclusively in the House of Representatives.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that IRAs form part of the income of Local Government Units (LGUs). Under Section 450(c) of the LGC, the annual income includes "income accruing to the general fund," excluding only special funds, transfers, and non-recurring income. IRAs are regular and recurring items of income that accrue automatically to the local treasury (LGC, Sec. 284; Sec. 306(i)). They are distinct from "transfers" or "special funds," which refer to specific funding support. This interpretation is supported by Department of Finance Order No. 3593, which explicitly includes IRAs in the definition of "Annual Income." Consequently, with the inclusion of IRAs, the Municipality of Santiago met the P20M income requirement.

2. **NO.** The Act validly originated in the House of Representatives. H.B. No. 8817 was filed prior to S.B. No. 1243 and initiated the legislative process. The Court applied the doctrine in *Tolentino v. Secretary of Finance*, holding that the filing of a substitute bill in the Senate in anticipation of a House bill does not violate the Constitution, provided the Senate withholds action as a body until it receives the House bill. Here, the Senate Committee waited to receive the approved H.B. No. 8817 before submitting its report and acting on the measure.

The petition is **DISMISSED** for lack of merit.
