I. CAPTION
VICTORINA A. CRUZ v. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. SALVADOR M. ENRIQUEZ, JR., SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT, HON. ARMAND V. FABELLA, SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, CULTURE AND SPORTS, and NORMA ABRACIA, G.R. No. 119155, January 30, 1996, 322 Phil. 649, Davide, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Victorina A. Cruz was a Guidance and Counselling Coordinator III at Valenzuela Memorial High School. Upon the nationalization of secondary school teachers under Executive Order No. 189 in 1987, her position was reclassified by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to Guidance Counselor R-56, resulting in a salary reduction. Aggrieved, she appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) of the Civil Service Commission. The MSPB granted her appeal and reclassified her position to Guidance Services Specialist II, SG-16, under R.A. 6758 (Salary Standardization Law).

The Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) requested the DBM to implement the MSPB decision, but the DBM denied the request, stating that the MSPB had no jurisdiction to reclassify positions. Cruz filed a motion for execution which the MSPB granted. When the DBM still refused to comply, Cruz filed a petition for *mandamus* with the Court of Appeals (CA) to compel the implementation of the MSPB decision. The CA denied the petition, ruling that the DBM has sole power over compensation and position classification, and the MSPB encroached on this authority.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the MSPB has jurisdiction to reclassify the petitioner’s position and order the payment of the corresponding salary.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, ruling that the MSPB acted without jurisdiction.

The Court held that the MSPB's jurisdiction under the Administrative Code of 1987 (E.O. No. 292, Book V, Title I, Subtitle A, Chapter III, Sec. 16[1][b]) to hear appeals regarding "violations of the merit system" refers to personnel actions (e.g., promotions, demotions) taken by an **appointing authority**. In this case, the petitioner's "demotion" in salary was not an act of an appointing authority but a result of nationalization **by operation of law**.

Instead, the grievances concerning position classification and compensation fall within the **primary jurisdiction of the DBM**, principally through the Compensation and Position Classification Board (CPCB). Under Section 17 of P.D. No. 985, as amended by Section 14 of R.A. No. 6758, the DBM has the power to administer the compensation and position classification system and to certify classification actions. Consequently, the MSPB decision reclassifying the position was void, and *mandamus* does not lie to compel the DBM to execute a decision rendered without jurisdiction.

Petition is **DISMISSED**.
