I. CAPTION
ALEJANDRO MANOSCA, ASUNCION MANOSCA and LEONICA MANOSCA v. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. BENJAMIN V. PELAYO, et al., G.R. No. 106440, September 30, 1996, 322 Phil. 442, Vitug, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners inherited a 492-square-meter parcel of land in Taguig [1]. The National Historical Institute (NHI) declared the property a national historical landmark because it was the birthsite of Felix Y. Manalo, the founder of the *Iglesia Ni Cristo* (INC) [1]. Consequently, the Republic filed a complaint for expropriation on behalf of the NHI [2]. Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the expropriation was not for a "public purpose" and that the act constituted an application of public funds for the benefit of a religious entity, violating Section 29(2), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution [3]. The Regional Trial Court denied the motion to dismiss [4]. The Court of Appeals subsequently dismissed petitioners' petition for certiorari and prohibition [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the expropriation of the birthsite of the founder of a religious sect constitutes a valid "public use" for the exercise of eminent domain.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the term "public use" is not limited to "use by the public" or to traditional uses such as roads, parks, or public buildings [6], [7]. It is a flexible concept synonymous with "public welfare," covering whatever is beneficially employed for the general community [8], [9]. The validity of the taking depends on the principal objective, not the casual consequences [9]. Here, the purpose is to recognize the distinctive contribution of Felix Manalo to Philippine culture and history, rather than to support the *Iglesia Ni Cristo* [9]. The practical reality that INC members may derive greater benefit than others is merely incidental and does not diminish the essence of the public use [9].

The petition is DENIED [10].
