I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, HOUSING AND LAND USE REGULATORY BOARD, ALFONSO MAGLAYA, et al., G.R. No. 104528, January 18, 1996, 322 Phil. 6, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondents were installment buyers of subdivision lots from Marikina Village, Inc. They faithfully paid their amortizations and constructed houses on the lots [1]. Unbeknownst to them, the developer had mortgaged the lots to petitioner Philippine National Bank (PNB) on December 18, 1975 [2]. The developer subsequently defaulted, leading PNB to foreclose on the mortgage and acquire the lots as the highest bidder [1].

When PNB attempted to dispossess the buyers or compel them to pay for the lots again, the buyers filed suits which were consolidated before the HLURB. The HLURB ruled that PNB could only collect the remaining amortizations from the buyers [3]. The Office of the President affirmed this ruling, invoking Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 957, "The Subdivision and Condominium Buyers’ Protective Decree" [3]. PNB appealed, arguing that P.D. 957, enacted on July 12, 1976, could not retroactively apply to the mortgage executed in 1975, and that PNB was not privy to the contracts between the developer and the buyers [2, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N P.D. 957 applies retroactively to mortgage contracts executed prior to its enactment.
2. W/N PNB is bound to accept the buyers' remaining amortizations despite not being a party to the land purchase agreements.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that P.D. 957 is a valid exercise of police power intended to protect innocent lot buyers from fraudulent practices of developers [4, 5]. Although laws generally have no retroactive effect, the specific intent of P.D. 957, as seen in its preamble and Sections 20, 21, and 23, requires retroactive application to achieve the demands of social justice [6, 7]. The Court ruled that the non-impairment clause must yield to the police power of the State when the contract affects public welfare [8, 9]. Thus, the mortgage contract, though valid at the time of execution, is subject to the provisions of P.D. 957.

2. **YES.** Under Section 18 of P.D. 957, a buyer has the option to pay the installment for the lot directly to the mortgagee, who must apply the payments to the corresponding mortgage indebtedness [10]. The Court ruled that the defense of privity of contract does not apply because the law explicitly regulates the relationship and grants this option to the buyer [11]. Consequently, PNB is obliged to accept the remaining amortizations from the private respondents and issue the corresponding titles upon full payment [10].

The petition is **DENIED** [12].
