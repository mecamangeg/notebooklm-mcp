I. CAPTION
ALEJANDRO MANOSCA, ASUNCION MANOSCA AND LEONICA MANOSCA v. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. BENJAMIN V. PELAYO, et al., G.R. No. 106440, September 30, 1996, 322 Phil. 442, Vitug, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioners inherited a 492-square-meter parcel of land in Taguig [2]. The National Historical Institute (NHI) declared the land a national historical landmark, identifying it as the birthsite of Felix Y. Manalo, the founder of the *Iglesia Ni Cristo* [2]. Consequently, the Republic of the Philippines filed a complaint for expropriation [2]. Petitioners moved to dismiss, arguing that the taking was not for "public use" and violated Section 29(2), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution, which prohibits the appropriation of public funds for the benefit of any sect, church, or system of religion [2]. The Regional Trial Court denied the motion to dismiss, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's order [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the expropriation of the birthsite of the founder of a religious sect constitutes a valid "public use" for the exercise of eminent domain [3].

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the term "public use," when not strictly defined by the Constitution, must be understood in its general concept of meeting a public need or exigency and is synonymous with "public welfare" [3]. The purpose of the expropriation is to recognize the distinctive contribution of the late Felix Manalo to Philippine culture, rather than to commemorate his founding of the *Iglesia Ni Cristo* [3]. The Court reasoned that while members of the sect may derive greater benefit from the site, such peculiar advantage is merely incidental and secondary; it does not diminish the essence and character of the public use [3]. Therefore, the act does not violate the constitutional prohibition against using public funds for religious purposes. The petition was DENIED [3].
