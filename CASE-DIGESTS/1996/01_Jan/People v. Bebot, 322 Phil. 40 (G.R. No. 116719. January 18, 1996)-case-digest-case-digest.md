I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PATRICIO AMIGO alias “BEBOT”, G.R. No. 116719, January 18, 1996, 322 Phil. 40, Melo, J. [1]

II. FACTS
On December 29, 1989, in Davao City, Benito Ng Suy was involved in a minor vehicular collision with Virgilio Abogada. Patricio Amigo, a passenger of Abogada, intervened in the ensuing verbal altercation between the drivers [2]. When Benito rebuked him for interfering, Amigo became irked and stabbed Benito multiple times with a five-inch knife, causing injuries that led to Benito's death from sepsis weeks later [2]. The Regional Trial Court convicted Amigo of Murder and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* [3]. Amigo appealed, arguing that since the 1987 Constitution abolished the death penalty, the penalty for Murder should be graduated down to *reclusion temporal* [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* is correctly imposed for Murder despite the prohibition of the death penalty under the 1987 Constitution [3].

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Regional Trial Court. The Court rejected the appellant's argument that the penalty should be reduced to *reclusion temporal* due to the constitutional abolition of the death penalty, thereby upholding the imposition of *reclusion perpetua* for the crime of Murder [3, 4]. The appealed decision is AFFIRMED [4].
