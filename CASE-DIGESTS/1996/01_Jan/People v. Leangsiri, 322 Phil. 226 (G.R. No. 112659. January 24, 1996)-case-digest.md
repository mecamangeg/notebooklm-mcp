I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SUCHINDA LEANGSIRI (AT LARGE), FATI OMOGBOLAHAN Y ALABI, YAMBA LISASI BHOLA, AND ZARIATU AMIDU, G.R. No. 112659, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 226, Puno, J.

II. FACTS
On March 31, 1993, accused Suchinda Leangsiri was arrested at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) for bringing in 8,225.31 grams of heroin [1]. He agreed to cooperate with NARCOM agents for a follow-up operation to deliver the drugs to his contacts at the Las Palmas Hotel in Manila [2]. Leangsiri checked into Room 504 with the drugs while agents hid in the washroom [2]. At the hotel lobby, appellant Amidu signaled to appellants Omogbolahan and Bhola, and the three proceeded to Room 504 [3]. Leangsiri let them in and showed them the heroin [4]. After examining the drugs, the appellants took the suitcase containing the heroin and attempted to leave the room, at which point agents arrested them [4].

Subsequent to the arrest in Room 504, agents searched Amidu’s separate room (Room 413) and found a paper with Leangsiri's name tucked in a telephone book [5], [6]. The trial court convicted the appellants of violating Section 4, Article II of R.A. No. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act) for conspiring to transport prohibited drugs [7]-[8]. Appellants filed a Motion for New Trial claiming newly discovered evidence, which the trial court denied [9], [10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N conspiracy existed among the appellants and Leangsiri to transport the heroin.
2. W/N there was a violation of Section 4, R.A. No. 6425 (transport/delivery) considering the drugs were under NARCOM control during the operation.
3. W/N the piece of paper found in Amidu's room via warrantless search is admissible in evidence.
4. W/N the Motion for New Trial based on newly discovered evidence should be granted.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Conspiracy was established by the appellants' concerted acts: Amidu waiting in the lobby and signaling the others, their joint arrival at Room 504, the examination of the drugs, and their act of taking possession of the suitcase [11]. These acts demonstrated a common unlawful design to transport the heroin [11].

2. **YES.** The Court held that the NARCOM agents were performing a lawful act in furtherance of a follow-up operation [12]. The crime of transporting a prohibited drug is committed by the act of carrying or conveying it from one place to another, regardless of whether the destination is reached [13]. The fact that the transport was interrupted by the arrest does not negate the commission of the crime, as the interruption implies the act had already commenced [14]. Citing *People v. Lo Ho Wing*, the Court ruled that the act of Leangsiri in transporting the heroin was the act of all co-conspirators [15], [14].

3. **NO.** The warrantless search of Amidu’s Room 413 was illegal. Under the "search incidental to a lawful arrest" doctrine, the search must be limited to the person of the arrestee and the area within their immediate control [16]-[17]. Since Amidu was arrested in Room 504, the search of Room 413 was outside the permissible area [18]. The "plain view" doctrine did not apply because the paper was tucked inside a book and not immediately apparent [18]. However, the inadmissibility of this single piece of evidence did not exculpate the appellants, as the remaining evidence was sufficient to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt [18].

4. **NO.** The requisites for a new trial were not met. The alleged "new" witness (Julita Camerino) was available and identified during the trial, so her testimony was not newly discovered [19]. Furthermore, her testimony was deemed incredible and unlikely to alter the result of the case [19].

The decision of the Regional Trial Court is **AFFIRMED** [20].
