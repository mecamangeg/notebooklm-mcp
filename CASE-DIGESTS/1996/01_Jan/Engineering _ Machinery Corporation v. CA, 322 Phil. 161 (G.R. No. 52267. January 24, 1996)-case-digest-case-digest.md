I. CAPTION
ENGINEERING & MACHINERY CORPORATION v. COURT OF APPEALS AND PONCIANO L. ALMEDA, G.R. No. 52267, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 161, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
On September 10, 1962, petitioner Engineering & Machinery Corporation entered into a contract with respondent Ponciano L. Almeda to fabricate and install a central air-conditioning system in Almeda's building for P210,000.00 [1]. The system was completed in 1963 [1]. In 1971, upon re-acquiring the building, Almeda discovered defects and a technical evaluation revealed the system failed to maintain the desired temperature and deviated from agreed plans [1]. On May 8, 1971, Almeda filed an action for damages [2]. Petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing the contract was one of sale and the action was barred by the six-month prescriptive period for hidden defects under Arts. 1566, 1567, and 1571 of the Civil Code [2]. Almeda contended the contract was for a piece of work governed by the ten-year prescriptive period under Art. 1144 [2]. The Trial Court ruled in favor of Almeda, classifying the contract as a piece of work, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision *in toto* [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the contract for the air-conditioning system is a contract of sale or a contract for a piece of work.
2. W/N the action for damages has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **NO** (to it being a sale) / **YES** (to it being a piece of work). The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' findings that the agreement was a contract for a piece of work [2], [3]. The contract involved the fabrication and installation of a central air-conditioning system specifically for the respondent's building, requiring compliance with agreed plans and specifications rather than being a generic product sold off-the-shelf [1].

2. **NO**. The action has not prescribed. Since the contract is for a piece of work, the prescriptive period is not the six-month period for hidden defects in a contract of sale, but rather the ten-year period for actions based on a written contract under Article 1144 of the Civil Code [2]. The complaint was filed on May 8, 1971, which is well within ten years from the completion of the project in 1963 [1], [2].

Accordingly, the petition is **DENIED** and the Court of Appeals' decision is **AFFIRMED** [3].
