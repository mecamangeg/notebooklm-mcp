I. CAPTION
BIENVENIDO VELARMA v. COURT OF APPEALS AND JOSEFINA PANSACOLA, G.R. No. 113615, January 25, 1996, 322 Phil. 435, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondent Josefina Pansacola filed an ejectment suit against petitioner Bienvenido Velarma in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Mauban, Quezon [1, 2]. She alleged that in May 1981, Velarma surreptitiously built a dwelling on her land, covered by TCT No. T-91037 in the name of her deceased husband, and refused to vacate despite demands and barangay conferences [1]. Velarma argued that the land belonged to the government due to an exchange agreement involving an abandoned provincial road between the Municipality of Mauban and the former owner [3, 4].

The RTC ruled in favor of Pansacola, ordering Velarma to vacate. It declared Velarma’s defense baseless because no deed was ever executed to perfect the alleged exchange [3]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision *in toto* [4]. Velarma petitioned the Supreme Court, maintaining that the property belongs to the government [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner's claim that the land belongs to the government is a valid defense against the ejectment suit.
2. W/N the RTC had jurisdiction over the ejectment suit.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court affirmed the lower court's finding that the defense was "baseless and unwarranted" [3]. No deed had ever been executed to "perfect the deal" between the municipality and the landowner regarding the exchange of the lot [3]. Without a formal deed, the mere agreement or minutes of the Sangguniang Bayan were insufficient to transfer ownership to the government or defeat the private respondent's title [3, 5].

2. **YES.** Although the ejectment suit should have been filed with the Municipal Trial Court (MTC), the petitioner raised the issue of ownership in the RTC and did not move to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction [6]. Instead, he filed an answer and went to trial. The Court ruled that **estoppel by laches** had already set in. Citing *Romualdez v. RTC* and *Pantranco North Express, Inc. v. CA*, the Court held that the petitioner could no longer assail the jurisdiction of the trial court after participating in the proceedings [2, 6].

The petition is **DENIED** [7].
