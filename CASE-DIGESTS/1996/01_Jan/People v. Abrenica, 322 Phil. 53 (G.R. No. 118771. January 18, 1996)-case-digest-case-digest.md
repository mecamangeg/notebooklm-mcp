I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MAXIMO ABRENICA y TEJANA, G.R. No. 118771, January 18, 1996, 322 Phil. 53, Melo, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Maximo Abrenica was charged and convicted by the Regional Trial Court for a crime resulting in the death of a victim referred to as "Yoyong" or "Rene." The prosecution's case relied heavily on the testimony of a witness named Garcia, who positively identified Abrenica as the culprit [2]. The defense questioned Garcia's credibility, citing inconsistencies in his testimony regarding the name of the deceased and pointing out a delay in his accusation against the accused [2]. Abrenica appealed the trial court's decision to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the prosecution witness's testimony was credible and sufficient to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, ruling that Garcia positively identified the accused as the culprit. The Court held that positive identification prevails over denials and alibis [2]. The alleged inconsistencies in Garcia's testimony—such as referring to the deceased as "Yoyong" or "Rene"—refer to collateral matters that do not detract from the main thrust of the testimony [2]. Furthermore, the delay in Garcia's accusation was satisfactorily explained by his fear of the accused, whom he knew had homicidal tendencies [2]. The Court also ruled that the crime was committed with treachery, as the attack was swift, unexpected, and directed at unarmed victims who offered no provocation [2]. The decision of the Regional Trial Court is AFFIRMED [3].
