I. CAPTION
PRIMO T. TANALA v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, DIANA S. OCHOA AND/OR VIA MARE CATERING SERVICES, G.R. No. 116588, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 342, Regalado, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Primo Tanala, a service driver for Via Mare Catering Services, was involved in an altercation with a co-employee, Rodolfo Laurente, at a restaurant near the company premises after work hours on November 9, 1992 [1]. A security guard reported that Tanala took a knife from his bag inside the company garage, a violation of company rules [1-3]. Based on this report, the company placed Tanala under a 30-day preventive suspension but did not readmit him afterwards, effectively dismissing him [1, 4]. Tanala filed a complaint for illegal dismissal [4].

The Labor Arbiter ruled the dismissal illegal and ordered reinstatement, relying on affidavits from co-employees stating they did not see Tanala carrying a knife [5, 6]. The NLRC reversed this decision and dismissed the complaint, giving more weight to the security guard’s positive testimony [3, 5]. Tanala appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the NLRC abused its discretion and that he was denied due process [5, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner was validly dismissed for violation of company rules.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to separation pay despite the validity of the dismissal.
3. W/N the petitioner was denied procedural due process.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court upheld the NLRC’s finding that the petitioner violated company rules by possessing a deadly weapon [3]. The positive, straightforward, and detailed report of the security guard stating that the petitioner brought out a knife inside the garage is entitled to greater weight than the negative affidavits of co-employees who merely attested that they did not notice him carrying a weapon [6]. Testimony is positive when a witness affirms a fact occurred, and negative when they say they did not see it happen; positive testimony is generally preferred [6].

2. **YES.** Although the dismissal was for a valid cause, the Court ruled that the ends of social and compassionate justice would be served by awarding separation pay [8]. Considering the incident occurred outside company premises after office hours, and it was the petitioner’s first infraction in almost 15 years of service with no prior derogatory record, he is entitled to equitable relief [8]. Citing *Soco v. Mercantile Corporation of Davao*, the Court granted separation pay equivalent to one month’s salary for every year of service [9].

3. **NO.** The petitioner was denied procedural due process because his dismissal was not preceded by the required two written notices: (1) a notice apprising him of the particular acts for which dismissal is sought, and (2) a subsequent notice of the decision to dismiss after a hearing [9, 10]. The notice of preventive suspension was insufficient, and he was never informed why he was not allowed to work after said suspension [10, 11]. Consequently, the company was ordered to pay an indemnity of P1,000.00 [10].

**Disposition:** The judgment of the NLRC is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the petitioner is adjudged entitled to separation pay equivalent to one month of his latest and highest salary for every year of service, and an indemnity of P1,000.00 for the violation of procedural due process [12].
