I. CAPTION
THE ESTATE OF HILARIO M. RUIZ, EDMOND RUIZ, EXECUTOR v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, MARIA PILAR RUIZ-MONTES, MARIA CATHRYN RUIZ, CANDICE ALBERTINE RUIZ, MARIA ANGELINE RUIZ AND THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF PASIG, BRANCH 156, G.R. No. 118671, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 590, Puno, J.

II. FACTS
Hilario M. Ruiz executed a holographic will naming his son Edmond Ruiz (petitioner), his adopted daughter Maria Pilar Ruiz-Montes (private respondent), and his three granddaughters as heirs. Hilario died on April 12, 1988 [1], [2]. Edmond, the named executor, failed to file for probate, prompting Maria Pilar to file a petition for probate four years later [2]. The probate court (RTC) admitted the will. Subsequently, the RTC ordered the release of rental funds to Edmond but only for administration expenses and an "allowance for support" for the three granddaughters [3], [4]. The RTC also ordered the release of titles to the heirs six months after the notice to creditors [5]. Edmond appealed, arguing that grandchildren are not entitled to support from the estate and that the distribution of titles was premature. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC’s order [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the testator’s grandchildren are entitled to an allowance for support from the estate pending settlement.
2. W/N the probate court may order the release of titles to the heirs before the estate's debts and obligations are paid.
3. W/N the executor has the absolute right to possess all properties of the estate.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 3, Rule 83 of the Revised Rules of Court, the allowance for support during the settlement of the estate is limited strictly to the "widow and children" of the deceased [7]. This provision does not extend to grandchildren, regardless of their minority or incapacity [8]. Consequently, the probate court erred in granting support to the testator's granddaughters.

2. **NO.** The order releasing titles was premature. Under Rule 90, Section 1, the distribution of the estate's residue can only occur after all debts, funeral charges, administration expenses, and estate taxes have been paid [9]. An advance distribution is allowed under Rule 109, Section 2 only if the distributees post a bond conditioned on the payment of said obligations [9], [10]. Here, the intrinsic validity of the will was still being contested, and no accounting of debts or tax payments had been made, making the release of titles improper [11], [12].

3. **NO.** The executor’s right to possess and manage the estate is not absolute. Under Rule 84, Section 3, an executor may retain possession of the estate only "so long as it is necessary for the payment of the debts and expenses of administration" [13]. Edmond, as a trustee, cannot unilaterally possess the assets without rendering a true account of his administration and expenses to the court [14].

The petition is GRANTED IN PART. The decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the orders granting allowance to the grandchildren and releasing the titles to private respondents are ANNULLED and SET ASIDE [15].
