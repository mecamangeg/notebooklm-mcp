I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CASIMIRO DE CASTRO AND ANTONIETO PLAZA, G.R. No. 98061, January 25, 1996, 322 Phil. 374, Regalado, J.

II. FACTS
On July 20, 1987, at around 2:30 A.M., Macario Aporbo and his group were walking home from a benefit dance in Marihatag, Surigao del Sur. Appellant Casimiro de Castro suddenly appeared, sideswiped the arm of Yolanda Aporbo, and thrust a pointed bolo at Macario. Macario parried the blow but was pushed to the ground by co-accused Antonieto Plaza. While Macario was in a supine position, the appellant stabbed him in the left chest, causing his instantaneous death [1, 2]. The accused fled to a nearby house where a witness, Felipe Lopez, saw the appellant holding a bloodied bolo and heard him admit to the stabbing [3].

The trial court convicted the appellant of Murder, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua*. The appellant appealed, arguing that the prosecution witnesses were not credible due to inconsistencies regarding the number of people in the victim's group, and interposed the defense of alibi, claiming he was sleeping at his father-in-law's house [4-6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the inconsistencies in the eyewitnesses' testimonies impair their credibility.
2. W/N the killing was attended by treachery.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that minor inconsistencies, such as the number of individuals accompanying the victim, do not discredit the witnesses. Such divergence is explained by the different vantage points of the witnesses and actually bolsters their credibility by negating the suspicion of a rehearsed story [7, 8]. The witnesses were consistent on the material fact that it was the appellant who stabbed the victim [9]. Furthermore, positive identification by eyewitnesses prevails over the defense of alibi, especially when the appellant was only 25 meters away from the crime scene and could have easily sneaked out [10, 11].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that treachery exists when the attack is done in a sudden and unexpected manner without provocation. The appellant surreptitiously attacked the victim, who was unarmed and unaware of the danger. The victim's ability to parry the first thrust was merely an instinctive reaction and does not negate treachery [12].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the civil indemnity is increased to P50,000.00 and the award for exemplary damages is deleted [13].
