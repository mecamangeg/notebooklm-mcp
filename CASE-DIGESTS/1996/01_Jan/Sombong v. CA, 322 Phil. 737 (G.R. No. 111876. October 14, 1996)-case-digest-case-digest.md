I. CAPTION
JOHANNA SOMBONG v. COURT OF APPEALS and MARIETTA NERI ALVIAR, LILIBETH NERI and ALL PERSONS HOLDING THE SUBJECT CHILD ARABELA SOMBONG IN THEIR CUSTODY, G.R. No. 111876, October 14, 1996, 322 Phil. 737, Hermosisima, Jr., J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Johanna Sombong is the mother of Arabella Sombong, born in April 1987. In November 1987, Arabella was admitted to the Sir John Clinic but was held by the clinic owners due to unpaid bills. In 1992, the NBI located a child named "Cristina Grace Neri" in the custody of respondent Marietta Neri Alviar, who claimed to have received the child from the clinic's dentist in April 1988. Petitioner filed a petition for Habeas Corpus in the RTC of Quezon City. The RTC granted the petition, ruling that Cristina and Arabella were the same person. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the decision, finding insufficient evidence of identity and noting the petitioner's lack of maternal emotion toward the child during the proceedings. [2, 3]

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the writ of habeas corpus should issue to transfer custody of the minor Cristina to the petitioner. [3]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the petition and affirmed the CA decision. The Court held that the grant of the writ in custody cases requires the concurrence of three requisites: (1) the petitioner has the right of custody over the minor; (2) the rightful custody is being withheld by the respondent; and (3) it is to the best interest of the minor to be in the petitioner's custody.

The petitioner failed to satisfy the first requisite as she could not establish that the minor "Cristina" was her daughter "Arabella." Evidence indicated Arabella was confined in the clinic until April 1989, whereas Cristina was already in the respondents' custody and baptized in April 1988. Furthermore, citing the Child and Youth Welfare Code and the Family Code, the Court ruled that the child's welfare is the paramount consideration. The respondents were found to be in a better position to care for the child, while the petitioner had no stable income and bleak prospects. [4, 5]
