I. CAPTION
ALFONSO BALMS, RUDACIANO ESTONILO AND ALFEO LOTILLA v. HON. TIRSO D’C. VELASCO and CENTRAL TEXTILE MILLS, INC., G.R. No. 118491, October 21, 1996, 322 Phil. 790, Hermosisima, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Central Textile Mills, Inc. (CTMI) filed a civil case for damages with a prayer for preliminary injunction before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, presided by respondent Judge Velasco [1]. CTMI alleged that during the execution of a labor decision, petitioners unlawfully dismantled and removed real property and serviceable machines that were not included in the levy [1]. The RTC issued a temporary restraining order and subsequently a writ of preliminary injunction [1]. Petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that the RTC lacked jurisdiction because the case involved incidents of a labor dispute execution, which falls under the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) or the Voluntary Arbitrator [1]. The RTC denied the motion, prompting petitioners to file a petition for Certiorari and Prohibition [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Regional Trial Court has jurisdiction over a civil case for damages arising from the alleged irregular execution of a decision rendered by a Voluntary Arbitrator in a labor dispute [2].

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that regular courts have no jurisdiction to hear and decide questions which arise and are incidental to the enforcement of decisions, orders, or awards rendered in labor cases [2]. The proceedings in the RTC were essentially an offshoot or incident in the enforcement of the final award of the Voluntary Arbitrator [2].

The Voluntary Arbitrator retains exclusive jurisdiction over incidents affecting the determination of irregularities committed during the implementation of the writ of execution [3]. Under Articles 218 and 224 of the Labor Code, the broad powers granted to the Labor Department and the NLRC vest them with jurisdiction over incidents arising from or connected with labor disputes to the exclusion of regular courts [3]. A case in which execution has been issued is considered still pending, and the tribunal which rendered the decision retains general supervisory control over the process of its execution [3]. Any irregularities in the enforcement of the writ must be litigated in the court or tribunal that issued it; to hold otherwise would sanction split jurisdiction, which is obnoxious to the orderly administration of justice [3]. The petition is granted.
