I. CAPTION
FIRST PHILIPPINE INTERNATIONAL BANK (FORMERLY PRODUCERS BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES) AND MERCURIO RIVERA v. COURT OF APPEALS, CARLOS EJERCITO, IN SUBSTITUTION OF DEMETRIO DEMETRIA, AND JOSE JANOLO, G.R. No. 115849, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 280, Panganiban, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner First Philippine International Bank (formerly Producers Bank) owned six parcels of land in Laguna. Respondents Demetrio Demetria and Jose Janolo negotiated with petitioner Mercurio Rivera, the Bank’s Property Management Department Manager, to buy the properties. On September 1, 1987, Rivera sent a letter with a counter-offer of P5.5 million. On September 28, 1987, respondents met with Rivera and Luis Co, the Bank's Senior Vice-President, who confirmed the price was final and approved. On September 30, 1987, Janolo accepted the offer in writing [2]. Subsequently, the Bank was placed under conservatorship, and the Conservator sought to repudiate the agreement. The Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the respondents, upholding the contract [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the contract of sale is enforceable under the Statute of Frauds.
2. W/N the Bank Conservator has the power to revoke the perfected contract.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The contract is enforceable. The Supreme Court held that the series of letters between the parties constituted sufficient memoranda to satisfy the Statute of Frauds under **Article 1403 of the Civil Code** [4]. Additionally, under **Article 1405 of the Civil Code**, contracts infringing the Statute of Frauds are ratified by the failure to object to the presentation of oral evidence. In this case, petitioners failed to object to oral testimony regarding the counter-offer and the meeting on September 28, 1987 [4].

2. **NO.** The Conservator cannot revoke valid, perfected contracts. While **Section 28-A of R.A. No. 265** grants the Conservator power to revoke actions of previous management, this authority does not extend to the post-facto repudiation of valid obligations. The Conservator's power is limited to preserving assets and restoring viability. To rule otherwise would violate the **non-impairment clause** of the Constitution (Art. III, Sec. 10) [4].

The petition is **DENIED**, the Court of Appeals decision is **AFFIRMED**, and the petitioner Bank is **REPRIMANDED** for forum shopping [3].
