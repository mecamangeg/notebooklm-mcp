I. CAPTION
LOURDES A. VALMONTE AND ALFREDO D. VALMONTE v. COURT OF APPEALS AND ROSITA DIMALANTA, G.R. No. 108538, January 22, 1996, 322 Phil. 96, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Lourdes and Alfredo Valmonte are spouses and residents of the United States. Alfredo is a member of the Philippine Bar and practices in Manila [1]. Private respondent Rosita Dimalanta, Lourdes' sister, filed an action for partition of real property and accounting against the petitioners in the RTC of Manila [1]. Based on a previous letter from Lourdes directing Dimalanta's counsel to address "all communications" to her lawyer-husband, Dimalanta served summons upon Alfredo at his Manila office [2, 3]. Alfredo accepted summons for himself but refused to accept for Lourdes, claiming lack of authority [4]. Consequently, Lourdes did not file an Answer [5]. The RTC denied Dimalanta's motion to declare Lourdes in default [5]. However, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the RTC on certiorari, declaring Lourdes in default and holding that she was validly served through her husband [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N there was valid service of summons on petitioner Lourdes A. Valmonte, a nonresident defendant not found in the Philippines.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that there was no valid service of process on Lourdes A. Valmonte [8].

The action for partition is *quasi in rem*, where jurisdiction over the person of a nonresident defendant is not essential, provided the court acquires jurisdiction over the *res* [9]. However, to satisfy due process requirements, service of summons on a nonresident who is not found in the Philippines must be effected extraterritorially in accordance with Rule 14, § 17 of the Revised Rules of Court [10, 11]. This section authorizes service by: (1) personal service; (2) publication in a newspaper of general circulation with a copy sent by registered mail to the defendant's last known address; or (3) in any other manner the court may deem sufficient [11].

The service on Alfredo did not fall under the first two modes. It also failed to qualify under the third mode because it was not made upon a prior court order granting leave, which is a mandatory requirement under Rule 14, § 17 [12, 13]. Furthermore, the letter sent by Lourdes seven months prior was for negotiation purposes and did not constitute a power of attorney appointing her husband as her agent for litigation [14]. Strict compliance with the modes of service is necessary to ensure due process [15].

The petition is GRANTED. The CA decision is REVERSED and the RTC orders are REINSTATED [16].
