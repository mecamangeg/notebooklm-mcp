I. CAPTION
GLADY M. GALVEZ v. JUDGE GEMINIANO A. EDUARDO, A.M. No. MTJ-94-984, January 30, 1996, 322 Phil. 619, Kapunan, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Glady M. Galvez filed an administrative complaint for grave misconduct against Respondent Judge Geminiano A. Eduardo of the MTC, General Tinio, Nueva Ecija. On May 30, 1994, Respondent issued a warrant of arrest against Complainant in Criminal Case No. 3017 for Grave Threats, even though she was not an accused in said case (only her husband was the defendant) [1]. Complainant was forced to post a P5,000.00 cash bond [1]. Respondent admitted the issuance but claimed it was a clerical error by his staff, explaining he intended to issue the warrant for Criminal Case No. 3016 (Grave Oral Defamation) where Complainant was a co-accused [1]. The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) recommended a reprimand, finding the mistake justifiable due to the confusion arising from consecutively numbered cases involving related parties [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent Judge is administratively liable for misconduct for issuing a warrant of arrest against a person not accused in the criminal case.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the issuance of a warrant of arrest is not a mere ministerial function but a responsibility that rests solely on the judge, as it involves the liberty of a person [2]. A judge cannot take refuge behind the inefficiency or negligence of court personnel regarding defects in court processes [2]. Respondent failed to observe the degree of care required by his office when he overlooked that Complainant was not a defendant in Criminal Case No. 3017, and judges are directly responsible for the proper discharge of official functions and the supervision of their staff [2].

Accordingly, the Court deviated from the OCA's recommendation and **IMPOSED A FINE** of P10,000.00 on Respondent Judge, with a stern warning that a repetition of the act will be dealt with more severely [3].
