I. CAPTION
FAUSTINA PUNCIA AND DOMINGO BALANTES v. HON. ANTONIO N. GERONA AND ROBERTO ROCO, G.R. No. 107640, September 30, 1996, 322 Phil. 455, Vitug, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Puncia and Balantes were lessees of a lot in Naga City owned by respondent Roco. In 1977, Roco filed an unlawful detainer case against them for non-payment of rentals. In 1988, the MTC ordered petitioners to vacate, which was affirmed by the RTC, the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court (G.R. No. 105386) in 1992 [1-3].

Following the finality of the judgment, MTC Judge Ocampo III issued an order of demolition on August 19, 1992. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari/prohibition with the RTC (Judge Gerona) to stop the demolition, alleging violations of due process. The demolition proceeded on September 2, 1992, and Judge Gerona subsequently dismissed the petition on September 16, 1992 [3]. After another failed appeal to the SC (G.R. No. 106589), petitioners filed the instant petition, arguing that the demolition violated Republic Act No. 7279 (Urban Development and Housing Act of 1992), which allegedly provided a moratorium on eviction and required 30 days' notice [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the order of demolition was invalid for violating the moratorium and notice requirements under Republic Act No. 7279.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that while the case was technically moot as the property had already been vacated and the structures demolished, the demolition was valid [6]. Regarding the petitioners' invocation of Republic Act No. 7279 to claim a moratorium on eviction, the Court ruled that Section 28(c) of said Act explicitly allows eviction or demolition "when there is a court order for eviction and demolition" [7]. Since the demolition was pursuant to a valid court order issued after a judgment that had long become final and executory, there was no violation of the law.

The petition is **DISMISSED**, with double costs against petitioners [7].
