I. CAPTION
LEGAR MANAGEMENT & REALTY CORPORATION v. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. JUAN O. ENRIQUEZ, JR., FELIPE PASCUAL, AND DIONISIO ANCHETA, G.R. No. 117423, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 366, Puno, J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Legasto owned an apartment unit in Quezon City which they leased to private respondents Pascual and Ancheta under a verbal contract [1]. The lease was renewable on a month-to-month basis with a monthly rental of P1,545.00 [2]. The spouses transferred their rights to the property to petitioner Legar Management & Realty Corporation [1]. In 1992, petitioner sent formal notices to private respondents terminating the lease and demanding they vacate the premises, but they refused [2].

Petitioner filed an ejectment case with the Metropolitan Trial Court (MTC) [3]. The MTC ruled in favor of petitioner, holding that the month-to-month lease was for a definite period and terminable at the end of any month [3]. On appeal, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) reversed the decision, stating that under the Rent Control Law (B.P. Blg. 877), the mere expiration of a month-to-month lease under Article 1687 of the Civil Code is not sufficient ground for ejectment [3]. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC, citing *Rivera v. Florendo* to support the view that eviction requires grounds other than expiration of the period [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a lessee of a residential property covered by the Rent Control Law can be ejected solely on the basis of the expiration of a verbal month-to-month lease contract.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that lease agreements with no specified period, but in which rentals are paid monthly, are considered to be on a month-to-month basis under Article 1687 of the Civil Code [5], [6]. These are considered leases with a definite period and they expire after the last day of any given thirty-day period, upon proper demand and notice by the lessor to vacate [6].

The Court clarified that Section 6 of B.P. Blg. 877 (Rent Control Law) does not suspend the effects of Article 1687 of the Civil Code [7]. Therefore, the valid termination of the verbal lease upon notice constitutes "Expiration of the period of the lease contract," which is a valid ground for ejectment under Section 5(f) of B.P. Blg. 877 [6], [8]. The Court relied on its ruling in *Acab v. Court of Appeals*, which reiterated that a month-to-month lease is a lease with a definite period [9], [8].

The petition is GRANTED. The Decisions of the Court of Appeals and the Regional Trial Court are REVERSED AND SET ASIDE. The Decision of the Metropolitan Trial Court is REINSTATED [10].
