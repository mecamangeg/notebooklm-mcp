I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. YOLANDA VELASCO Y PAMINTUAN, G.R. No. 110592, January 23, 1996, 322 Phil. 146, Francisco, J.

II. FACTS
Following surveillance confirming reports that Yolanda Velasco was peddling drugs in Tondo, police conducted a buy-bust operation on June 28, 1991 [1]. A poseur-buyer purchased a deck of shabu for P50.00, leading to her arrest and the recovery of five additional decks, totaling less than one gram [1]. Velasco denied the charge, claiming a frame-up [1]. The RTC convicted her of violating the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972 (R.A. 6425) and sentenced her to life imprisonment [1]. On appeal, Velasco argued, among other things, that the RTC lost jurisdiction over the case. She contended that R.A. 7691 expanded the jurisdiction of Metropolitan Trial Courts to include offenses punishable by imprisonment not exceeding six years. Since R.A. 7659 and the doctrine in *People v. Simon* reduced the penalty for possessing less than one gram of shabu to *prision correccional* (below six years), she claimed the RTC was divested of jurisdiction [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the RTC lost jurisdiction over the case due to the reduced penalty under R.A. 7659 and the expansion of MTC jurisdiction under R.A. 7691.

IV. RULING
**NO.** Jurisdiction is determined by the law in force at the time of the institution of the action [2]. When the Information was filed on July 3, 1991, Section 39 of R.A. 6425 vested the RTC (then Court of First Instance) with concurrent original jurisdiction over all offenses under the Act, regardless of the penalty [2]. The Court held that jurisdiction, once attached, cannot be ousted by subsequent legislation [2]. Furthermore, R.A. 7691, which expanded the jurisdiction of lower courts, applies retroactively only to civil cases not yet at the pre-trial stage, and not to criminal cases [2].

The decision is **AFFIRMED** with **MODIFICATION**. Applying R.A. 7659 and the *Simon* doctrine, the penalty is reduced to *prision correccional*. Since the appellant had already served more than the maximum penalty, her immediate release was ordered [3].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Davide, Jr., J.** (Concurring): Clarified that all drug-related cases, regardless of quantity and penalty, still fall within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the RTC because R.A. 7691 did not amend Section 39 of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972 [3].
