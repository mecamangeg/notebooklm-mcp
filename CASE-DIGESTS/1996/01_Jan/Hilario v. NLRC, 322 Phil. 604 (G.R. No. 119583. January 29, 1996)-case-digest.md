I. CAPTION
NESCITO C. HILARIO v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, REYNOLDS PHILIPPINES CORPORATION, et al., G.R. No. 119583, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 604, Romero, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Nescito Hilario was hired by private respondent Reynolds Philippines as personnel manager in December 1984. In November 1985, he was informed of his termination effective January 1, 1986, on the ground of retrenchment due to financial losses [1]. Hilario filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. The Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint, but the NLRC reversed this decision, finding the dismissal illegal because the retrenchment was tainted with bad faith—the company advertised for replacements and increased salaries for successors despite claiming losses [2-4]. However, the NLRC limited Hilario’s backwages to the period between his dismissal and his appointment as Quezon City Attorney in August 1986, and awarded P30,000 moral and P20,000 exemplary damages [5]. Hilario petitioned the Supreme Court, seeking reinstatement, full backwages for three years, and increased damages [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is entitled to reinstatement.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to full backwages for three years without deduction.
3. W/N the petitioner is entitled to increased damages.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Reinstatement is not feasible due to the doctrine of "strained relations." The Court noted that Hilario held a managerial position which requires the full trust and confidence of the employer. Given the private respondent's vehement refusal to reinstate him and the mutual imputations of bad faith, reinstatement would not serve a logical purpose. Consequently, separation pay equivalent to one month's salary is awarded in lieu of reinstatement [7, 8].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that while the full backwages provision of R.A. No. 6715 is not retroactive, existing jurisprudence for illegal dismissals occurring before March 21, 1989, grants backwages for a fixed period of three (3) years without deduction or qualification. The NLRC erred in limiting the backwages only up to the time petitioner found new employment in August 1986. Thus, Hilario is entitled to three years of backwages from January 1, 1986, to January 1, 1989 [9, 10].

3. **NO.** The Court found that while Reynolds Philippines acted in bad faith regarding the retrenchment (by hiring replacements at higher salaries), this did not constitute "gross" bad faith or wanton and oppressive behavior required for higher damages. Accordingly, the Court held that the award for damages should not be increased and instead reduced the moral damages to P20,000 [10, 11].

The NLRC decision is MODIFIED. Private respondent is ordered to pay backwages for three years, unpaid salary for December 1985, Christmas bonus, separation pay, and reduced moral damages of P20,000 [10].
