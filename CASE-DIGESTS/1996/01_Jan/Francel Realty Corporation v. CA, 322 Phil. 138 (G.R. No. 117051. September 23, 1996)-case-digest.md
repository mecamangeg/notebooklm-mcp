I. CAPTION
FRANCEL REALTY CORPORATION v. COURT OF APPEALS and FRANCISCO T. SYCIP, G.R. No. 117051, September 23, 1996, 322 Phil. 138, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Francel Realty Corporation executed a Contract to Sell a townhouse unit to respondent Francisco T. Sycip for P451,000.00. Sycip stopped paying monthly amortizations after October 30, 1990, alleging defective construction. He filed a complaint for "unsound real estate business practice" against petitioner with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB). Subsequently, petitioner filed a complaint for unlawful detainer against Sycip in the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Bacoor, Cavite for failure to pay and vacate.

The MTC dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that the case was cognizable by the HLURB. However, the MTC ordered petitioner to pay Sycip P10,000.00 as moral damages, P10,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P3,000.00 as attorney’s fees. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) affirmed the decision. The Court of Appeals (CA) dismissed petitioner's appeal. Petitioner argues that since the MTC ruled it had no jurisdiction over the main case, it lacked jurisdiction to award damages on the counterclaim.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the MTC has jurisdiction over an action for unlawful detainer filed by a subdivision developer against a buyer who stopped amortizations due to alleged defective construction.
2. W/N the MTC can award damages on a counterclaim after dismissing the main complaint for lack of jurisdiction.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The case falls within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the HLURB (now DHSUD). The issue involves the rights and obligations of parties in a sale of real estate under P.D. No. 957. Sycip claimed the right to stop paying amortizations under Section 23 of P.D. No. 957 due to the developer's failure to complete the project. The Court held that this is not a simple unlawful detainer case but one involving "unsound real estate business practices" and the collection of amortizations, which are exclusively cognizable by the HLURB.

2. **NO.** A court cannot grant a counterclaim if it lacks jurisdiction over the main subject matter. Pursuant to Rule 6, Section 8 of the Rules of Court, a party may file a counterclaim only if the court has jurisdiction to entertain the claim. Since the MTC correctly held it had no jurisdiction over the complaint, it erred in granting the respondent's counterclaim for damages. Furthermore, the award lacked basis as there was no proof of bad faith by the petitioner, and the respondent's answer was filed out of time.

ACCORDINGLY, the decision of the Court of Appeals is REVERSED and the complaint against private respondent is DISMISSED. The private respondent’s counterclaim is likewise DISMISSED.
