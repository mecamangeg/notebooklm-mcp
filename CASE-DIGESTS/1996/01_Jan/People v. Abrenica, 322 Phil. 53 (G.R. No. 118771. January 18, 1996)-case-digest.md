I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MAXIMO ABRENICA Y TEJANA, G.R. No. 118771, January 18, 1996, 322 Phil. 53, Melo, J.

II. FACTS
On September 11, 1991, stevedores Ramiro Garcia and Reynaldo "Yoyong" Mabisa were unloading cargo from the barge "Martam III" in Manila. Suddenly, the accused-appellant, Maximo Abrenica, appeared and fired a gun at Garcia without provocation, hitting him in the chest, hand, and lip. Abrenica then shot Mabisa in the face. Mabisa died from his wounds, while Garcia survived after hospitalization. The RTC convicted Abrenica of Murder and Frustrated Murder. Abrenica appealed, arguing that Garcia's testimony was not credible due to inconsistencies regarding the deceased's name (referred to as "Yoyong" and "Rene") and the work schedule, and that his identification of the accused was flawed. Abrenica interposed the defense of alibi, claiming he was asleep in a nearby truck.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt despite the alleged inconsistencies in the prosecution witness's testimony.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court held that the survivor, Garcia, positively and categorically identified Abrenica as the assailant. Positive identification prevails over the accused's defense of denial and alibi [1]. The alleged inconsistencies regarding the victim's nickname and the work hours refer to collateral matters that do not impinge on the main fact that Abrenica shot the victims; furthermore, discrepancies between affidavits and court testimony do not necessarily discredit a witness [2].

The Court also ruled that the crime was committed with **treachery**, qualifying it to Murder and Frustrated Murder. The attack was swift, unexpected, and directed at unarmed victims who were given no opportunity to defend themselves [1]. The decision of the trial court is **AFFIRMED**.
