I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DANILO MAGSOMBOL, G.R. No. 98197, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 196, Puno, J.

II. FACTS
On December 25, 1980, at around 4:00 p.m. in San Luis, Batangas, accused-appellant Danilo Magsombol and the victim, Geraldo Magsombol, engaged in a fistfight after Geraldo questioned the accused’s brother-in-law's recruitment activities [1]. Later that evening, around 9:00 p.m., the accused met Geraldo, who was walking home, and stabbed him in the stomach without warning, causing his death [1]. The accused invoked self-defense, claiming Geraldo attacked him and the stabbing occurred while wrestling for the weapon [1]. The trial court rejected this claim, convicted the accused of Murder qualified by treachery and evident premeditation, and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused acted in valid self-defense.
2. W/N the crime committed was Murder.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court found the claim of self-defense to be a complete fabrication contradicted by physical evidence. The victim sustained two wounds—a linear abrasion and a deep stab wound—which negated the theory of a single accidental stab during a grapple [2]. The accused's own injuries were slight and likely caused by the earlier fistfight or stumbling during flight, not by the alleged aggression of the victim [2]. Furthermore, the defense witness’s testimony was proven perjured by documentary evidence showing he could not have been at the scene [2]. Absent unlawful aggression, self-defense cannot prosper [2].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the crime committed was Homicide, not Murder. **Evident Premeditation** was not proven as there was no evidence of planning or sufficient lapse of time for the accused to reflect on the consequences of his act; the prior fistfight was insufficient to establish a determination to kill [3]. **Treachery** was also not established because mere suddenness of an attack does not constitute treachery absent evidence that the accused consciously and deliberately adopted the mode of attack to ensure his safety [3]. The judgment is MODIFIED to convict the accused of Homicide.
