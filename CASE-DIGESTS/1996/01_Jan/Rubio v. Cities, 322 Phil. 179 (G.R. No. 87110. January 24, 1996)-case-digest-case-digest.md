I. CAPTION
Gil Rubio v. The Hon. Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Branch 4, Cagayan de Oro City, City Sheriff of Cagayan de Oro City, and Spouses Lim Liong Kang and Lim Pue King, G.R. No. 87110, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 179, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Spouses Lim filed an ejectment suit against petitioner Gil Rubio. The MTCC ruled in favor of the Spouses Lim, ordering Rubio to vacate. The decision provided that execution shall issue immediately "except on the order to vacate... which shall issue after six (6) months from and after receipt by defendant of this decision, unless an appeal has been perfected." Rubio appealed to the RTC and the CA, both of which affirmed the decision. After the judgment became final and the case was remanded, the MTCC gave Rubio 30 days to remove his improvements. Upon his failure to do so, the court issued a "Writ of Demolition." Rubio filed a petition arguing he was entitled to a new six-month grace period starting from the finality of judgment, that the "Writ of Demolition" was invalid without a prior Writ of Execution, and that execution should be suspended due to a separate pending ownership case.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is entitled to a fresh six-month period to vacate after the judgment became final.
2. W/N the "Writ of Demolition" was valid despite the alleged absence of a prior Writ of Execution.
3. W/N the pendency of a separate civil case involving ownership suspends the execution of the ejectment judgment.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The six-month period granted in the MTCC decision was explicitly reckoned "from and after receipt" of the decision, not from its finality. Furthermore, the condition "unless an appeal has been perfected" rendered this period inoperative because Rubio's appeal effectively extended his stay indefinitely. Having consumed more than three years during the appeals process, the petitioner cannot claim a grace period that was already spent [1].

2. **YES.** Although denominated as a "Writ of Demolition," the writ substantially complied with the form and contents of a writ of execution as required by Section 8, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. It was issued in the name of the Republic, referred to the judgment, stated the amount due, and required the delivery of possession. Under the rule of liberal construction, the writ was sufficient to serve as a writ of execution [2].

3. **NO.** An action for unlawful detainer involves only the issue of material possession (*possession de facto*), which is distinct from an action for reconveyance involving ownership. The pendency of a case regarding ownership does not divest the lower court of jurisdiction over the ejectment case nor bar the execution of its judgment. Additionally, the petitioner was not even a party to the separate civil case cited [2].

The petition is **DENIED**.
