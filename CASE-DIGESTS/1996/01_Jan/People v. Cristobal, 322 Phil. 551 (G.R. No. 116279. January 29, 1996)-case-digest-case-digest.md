I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROGELIO CRISTOBAL, G.R. No. 116279, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 551, Davide, Jr., J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On March 31, 1986, the victim, AAA, was bathing in a creek when the accused, Rogelio Cristobal, attacked her from behind, boxed her stomach, submerged her face in the water, and raped her [2]. AAA immediately reported the incident to her husband and the police, and a medical examination confirmed lacerations and the presence of seminal fluid [2]. Cristobal fled and was arrested only in July 1993 [2]. He raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was plowing a field three kilometers away [2]. The Regional Trial Court convicted him of rape and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* [2]. Cristobal appealed, challenging the victim's credibility due to an alleged inconsistency in her testimony regarding the exact moment her panties were removed during the assault [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the inconsistency in the victim's testimony impairs her credibility.
2. W/N the defense of alibi should prosper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The inconsistency regarding whether the panties were removed before or after the victim was laid on the ground is trivial and does not impair her credibility [3]. The Supreme Court held that such minor discrepancies actually enhance credibility as they manifest spontaneity and a lack of scheming to fabricate a story [3]. The Court applied the settled rule that when a woman says she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show she has been raped, provided her testimony meets the test of credibility and there is no proof of ill motive on her part [3].

2. **NO.** For the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must establish the physical impossibility of his presence at the crime scene at the time of the commission [4]. The accused admitted he was only three kilometers away from the creek, a distance that can be covered in a few minutes, thus failing to establish physical impossibility [4].

The appeal is **DISMISSED** and the decision of the Regional Trial Court is **AFFIRMED** with **MODIFICATION** increasing moral damages to P40,000.00 and awarding exemplary damages of P25,000.00 [4].
