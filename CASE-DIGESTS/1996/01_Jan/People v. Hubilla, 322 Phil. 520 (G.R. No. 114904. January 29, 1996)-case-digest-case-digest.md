I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DEMETRIO HUBILLA, JR. AND SALVADOR PALLE, G.R. No. 114904, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 520, Davide, Jr., J. [1]

II. FACTS
On June 14, 1991, in Casiguran, Sorsogon, prosecution witness Reynaldo Halcon saw CAFGU members Demetrio Hubilla, Jr. and Salvador Palle poking their M-14 rifles at the victim, Antonio Rosas. When Rosas refused to lower his hoe, Hubilla fired a shot near his feet. As Rosas ran away, Hubilla shot him again, hitting him in the neck and killing him. Palle poked his rifle at the victim but did not fire. The accused claimed self-defense, alleging Rosas attacked them with a hoe. The Regional Trial Court convicted them of Murder and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua*. [2]

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused acted in self-defense.
2. W/N conspiracy existed between Hubilla and Palle.
3. W/N the crime committed was Murder. [3]

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court found the plea of self-defense incredible. It is contrary to human experience for a man armed only with a hoe to attack two CAFGU members armed with high-powered M-14 rifles. Furthermore, physical evidence showing the victim was shot in the neck contradicted the defense theory that the victim was facing Hubilla during an imminent attack. [3]

2. **YES.** Conspiracy was established by the concerted acts of the accused. Although Palle did not fire a shot, his act of poking his rifle at the victim to intimidate him and subsequently fleeing the scene with Hubilla showed unity of purpose. His presence gave encouragement and a sense of security to the assailant, making him liable as a co-conspirator. [4]

3. **NO.** The crime committed was Homicide, not Murder. Treachery was not present because the victim was forewarned of the attack when the accused first poked their rifles and fired a warning shot, giving him an opportunity to flee. Evident premeditation was also not proven as the encounter was casual and the attack was made on the spur of the moment. The judgment is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, finding the accused guilty of Homicide and sentencing them to an indeterminate penalty of 8 years of *prision mayor* to 14 years and 8 months of *reclusion temporal*.
