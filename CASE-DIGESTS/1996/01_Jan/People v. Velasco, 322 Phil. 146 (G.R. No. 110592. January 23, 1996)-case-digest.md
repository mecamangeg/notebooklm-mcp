I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. YOLANDA VELASCO Y PAMINTUAN, G.R. No. 110592, January 23, 1996, 322 Phil. 146, Francisco, J.

II. FACTS
On June 28, 1991, a police team conducted a buy-bust operation against appellant Yolanda Velasco, known as the "Shabu Queen" of Quiricada, Tondo. Pat. Godoy, posing as a buyer, purchased a deck of "shabu" (methamphetamine hydrochloride) from Velasco for P50.00. Upon the transaction, the team arrested Velasco and found five more decks of shabu in her possession; the total quantity was less than one gram. Velasco claimed she was merely washing clothes when officers barged in and planted evidence. The RTC convicted her of selling prohibited drugs under the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972 (R.A. 6425) and sentenced her to life imprisonment. Velasco appealed, arguing the warrantless arrest was illegal and that under R.A. 7691, the RTC lost jurisdiction over her case due to the small quantity of drugs involved.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the warrantless arrest and subsequent search were valid.
2. W/N the RTC retained jurisdiction over the case despite the passage of R.A. 7691.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The appellant was arrested *in flagrante delicto*. Under Section 5(a), Rule 113 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure, a peace officer may arrest a person without a warrant when, in his presence, the person is actually committing an offense. Since the arrest was lawful, the search incidental to it was also valid [1, 2]. The Court upheld the presumption of regularity in the police officers' performance of duty, noting the absence of proof of ill motive or intent to frame the appellant [3].

2. **YES.** Jurisdiction is determined by the law in force at the time of the institution of the action. When the information was filed on July 3, 1991, Section 39 of R.A. 6425 vested the RTC (then Court of First Instance) with concurrent original jurisdiction over all drug offenses regardless of the penalty [4, 5]. R.A. 7691, which expanded the jurisdiction of Municipal Trial Courts to offenses punishable by up to six years imprisonment, does not apply retroactively to criminal cases pending or decided by the RTC [4]. However, applying the beneficial provisions of R.A. 7659 and the doctrine in *People v. Simon*, the penalty was modified because the shabu involved was less than 200 grams.

The judgment is **AFFIRMED** with **MODIFICATION** reducing the penalty to an indeterminate sentence of six (6) months of *arresto mayor* as minimum to four (4) years and two (2) months of *prision correccional* as maximum. Immediate release was ordered as appellant had served beyond the maximum penalty [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Davide, Jr., J. (Concurring):** Emphasized that all drug-related cases, regardless of quantity or penalty, still fall within the exclusive original jurisdiction of Regional Trial Courts under Section 39 of R.A. 6425, as this section was not amended by R.A. 7691 [7].
