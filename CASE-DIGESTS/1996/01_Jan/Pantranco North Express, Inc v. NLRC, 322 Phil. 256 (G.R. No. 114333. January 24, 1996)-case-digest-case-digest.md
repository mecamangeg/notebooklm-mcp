I. CAPTION
PANTRANCO NORTH EXPRESS, INC. v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION and REYNALDO M. RUEDA, G.R. No. 114333, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 256, Puno, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondent Reynaldo Rueda was employed by petitioner Pantranco North Express, Inc. in 1956. He was retrenched in 1978 and received separation pay, but was rehired in 1981 [1]. In 1987, Rueda stabbed a co-employee. While initially recommending dismissal for serious misconduct, petitioner ultimately approved Rueda's retirement "due to medical reasons" (tuberculosis) in 1988 [1]. Rueda filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. The Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint but awarded retirement pay based on service from 1981 [2]. The NLRC reversed, ruling that Rueda was illegally dismissed and ordering the payment of separation pay computed from his original hiring in 1956 [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Rueda was validly dismissed on the ground of illness.
2. W/N the computation of separation pay should include the period of employment prior to the 1978 retrenchment.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that Rueda's dismissal was invalid because the petitioner failed to comply with the requirements for termination due to disease. Under Section 8, Rule 1, Book VI of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Labor Code, the employer must obtain a certification by a competent public health authority that the disease is of such nature or at such a stage that it cannot be cured within six months even with proper medical treatment [3]. Petitioner failed to submit this certification and merely presented a radiograph report [3].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion in reckoning Rueda's employment from 1956. Rueda accepted his retrenchment pay in 1978 without protest. Even if the retrenchment was unjustified, any action questioning it had prescribed after four years pursuant to Article 1146 of the Civil Code [4]. Consequently, his length of service must be computed only from the date he was rehired on February 9, 1981 [4].

The petition is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that separation pay be computed from the date of rehiring in 1981 [4].
