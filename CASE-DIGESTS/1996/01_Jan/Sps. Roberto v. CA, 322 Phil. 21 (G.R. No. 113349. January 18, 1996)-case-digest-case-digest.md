I. CAPTION
SPOUSES ROBERTO AND LILIA MONDONEDO v. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. LUCIA VIOLAGO ISNANI, MAKATI DEPUTY SHERIFF MAXIMO CONTRERAS, REGISTER OF DEEDS OF MAKATI, REGISTER OF DEEDS OF LAS PIÑAS, REGISTER OF DEEDS OF BAGUIO CITY, AND SECURITY BANK AND TRUST COMPANY, G.R. No. 113349, January 18, 1996, 322 Phil. 21, Panganiban, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioners Spouses Mondonedo filed a complaint against private respondent Security Bank and Trust Company in the RTC of Makati. During the pre-trial hearing, the RTC dismissed the complaint after petitioners' counsel arrived late, allegedly due to a flooded street caused by a typhoon. The RTC subsequently denied their motion for reconsideration. Instead of filing an ordinary appeal, petitioners filed a petition for *certiorari* with the Court of Appeals (CA) to set aside the RTC orders. The CA dismissed the petition, ruling that the proper remedy was appeal, not *certiorari*, and further noted that petitioners failed to state the date of receipt of the order denying their motion for reconsideration, rendering the timeliness of the petition indeterminable [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N *certiorari* is the proper remedy for a plaintiff declared non-suited for failure to appear at the pre-trial hearing [3].

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA, ruling that the proper remedy for a plaintiff declared non-suited is an **appeal**, not *certiorari* [3]. A dismissal for failure to appear at the pre-trial hearing is deemed an adjudication on the merits unless the order states otherwise [3]. Since the dismissal acts as a final resolution of the case, the correct recourse is to appeal the order of dismissal or the order denying the motion for reconsideration [3]. The Court reiterated the settled rule that where appeal is the proper remedy, *certiorari* will not lie [3]. The petition was denied and the temporary restraining order was lifted [3].
