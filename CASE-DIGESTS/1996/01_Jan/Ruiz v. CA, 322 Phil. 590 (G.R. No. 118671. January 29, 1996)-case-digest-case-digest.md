I. CAPTION
THE ESTATE OF HILARIO M. RUIZ, EDMOND RUIZ, EXECUTOR v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, MARIA PILAR RUIZ-MONTES, MARIA CATHRYN RUIZ, CANDICE ALBERTINE RUIZ, MARIA ANGELINE RUIZ AND THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF PASIG, BRANCH 156, G.R. No. 118671, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 590, Puno, J.

II. FACTS
Hilario M. Ruiz executed a holographic will naming as heirs his son Edmond (petitioner), his adopted daughter Maria Pilar (private respondent), and his three granddaughters. Hilario died on April 12, 1988. Edmond failed to file for probate, so Maria Pilar filed the petition four years later. The will was admitted to probate, and Edmond was appointed executor.

Maria Pilar moved for the release of funds for the support of the three granddaughters and for the release of the certificates of title to the heirs. The RTC ordered the release of funds for the granddaughters' support and the release of the titles six months after the notice to creditors. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC. Edmond petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing that grandchildren are not entitled to support from the estate and that the distribution of titles was premature as estate taxes and debts had not been settled [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the grandchildren of the decedent are entitled to an allowance for support from the estate pending settlement.
2. W/N the probate court can validly order the release of titles to heirs prior to the payment of all debts and estate taxes.
3. W/N the executor is entitled to the possession of all estate funds without rendering an accounting.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Grandchildren are not entitled to provisional support from the estate. Section 3, Rule 83 of the Revised Rules of Court expressly limits the grant of an allowance to the "widow and children" of the decedent during the settlement of the estate. This provision does not extend to grandchildren, regardless of their minority or incapacity [3].

2. **NO.** The order releasing titles was premature. Under Section 1, Rule 90 of the Rules of Court, the distribution of the residue of the estate can only be made after all debts, funeral charges, administration expenses, allowance to the widow, and estate taxes have been paid. An advance distribution is allowed only if the distributees post a bond conditioned for the payment of said obligations. In this case, the estate tax had not yet been paid or even ascertained, and no bond was posted [4].

3. **NO.** While an executor has the right to possess and manage the estate under Section 3, Rule 84, he is a trustee who cannot unilaterally assign funds to himself or others without submitting an inventory and rendering a true account of his administration. The probate court correctly required Edmond to submit an accounting before releasing further funds [5].

**Disposition:** The decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the orders granting an allowance to the grandchildren and ordering the release of titles to the private respondents are **ANNULLED and SET ASIDE** [5].
