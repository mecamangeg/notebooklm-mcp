I. CAPTION
LOURDES A. VALMONTE and ALFREDO D. VALMONTE v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS and ROSITA DIMALANTA, G.R. No. 108538, January 22, 1996, 322 Phil. 96, Mendoza, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioners Lourdes and Alfredo Valmonte are spouses residing in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A. Alfredo is a member of the Philippine Bar who practices in Manila, commuting between the US and the Philippines [2]. Private respondent Rosita Dimalanta, Lourdes' sister, filed an action for partition of real property and accounting of rentals in Manila against the petitioners [2].

Dimalanta alleged that summons could be served on the spouses at Alfredo's law office in Manila, citing a letter from Lourdes which directed Dimalanta's counsel to address all communications to her lawyer-husband [3]. The process server served summons on Alfredo at his office; he accepted his copy but refused to accept summons for Lourdes, stating he was not authorized [3]. Lourdes failed to answer, and Dimalanta moved to declare her in default. The RTC denied the motion, ruling there was no valid service [3]. The CA reversed the RTC and declared Lourdes in default, holding that she had authorized her husband to receive communications [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N there was valid service of summons on petitioner Lourdes A. Valmonte. [4]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that there was no valid service of process on Lourdes A. Valmonte [4].

The action for partition and accounting is an action *quasi in rem* [4]. Since Lourdes is a nonresident not found in the Philippines, service of summons must be effected in accordance with Rule 14, Section 17 of the Revised Rules of Court [4]. This rule requires service to be made (1) by personal service out of the country, (2) by publication with registered mail to the last known address, or (3) in any other manner the court may deem sufficient [4].

Service on Alfredo failed to satisfy the third mode ("any other manner") because:
1.  It was not made upon a prior order of the court as required by Rule 14, Sec. 17 [5].
2.  It was not made upon prior leave of court applied for by motion in writing [5].
3.  Because there was no order granting leave, Lourdes was not given the mandatory period of at least sixty (60) days to answer, which is required for nonresident defendants to ensure due process [5].

Strict compliance with these requirements is necessary to assure the observance of due process. The CA decision was REVERSED and the RTC orders were REINSTATED [5].
