I. CAPTION
PIZZA HUT/PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, LABOR ARBITER SALIMATHAR NAMBI AND FROILAN RUEDA, G.R. No. 117059, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 579, Puno, J.

II. FACTS
Froilan Rueda, employed as Assistant Manager III at Pizza Hut, was dismissed on May 31, 1990, for dishonesty under the Employee Code of Conduct [1, 2]. The charge stemmed from an incident on February 14, 1990, where Rueda, acting as closing manager, failed to deposit the day's tips (P705.00) in the safety vault. Instead, he kept the money and only returned it on February 21, 1990, minus P100.00 which he took as a cash advance [3, 4]. Rueda explained the omission was an oversight due to the hectic Valentine's Day operations and the absence of the tip custodian [5].

Rueda filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. The Labor Arbiter ruled in his favor, ordering backwages, separation pay (due to strained relations), and attorney's fees, holding that Rueda was denied due process because he did not sign the investigation minutes [6-8]. The NLRC affirmed the decision. Pizza Hut petitioned for certiorari, arguing it afforded Rueda due process and that there was valid cause for dismissal [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Rueda was afforded due process before dismissal.
2. W/N there was just cause to dismiss Rueda for dishonesty.
3. W/N the award of attorney's fees was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The records show the petitioner satisfied the requirements of due process. Rueda was required to submit a written explanation, which he did on February 23, 1990 [10]. He was also directed to appear before an investigating committee where he was given the opportunity to explain his side [10]. The Court held that the essence of due process in administrative proceedings is the opportunity to be heard, and Rueda's refusal to sign the minutes of the investigation did not negate the fact that proceedings were held [10].

2. **NO.** The dismissal was not valid because there was no clear showing of dishonesty. The Court credited Rueda with the presumption of good faith, noting that his failure to deposit the tips was likely an oversight caused by busy operations on Valentine's Day [5]. Furthermore, the penalty of dismissal was too harsh and disproportionate to the offense [11]. The Court considered that this was Rueda's first offense in four and a half years, the amount involved was minimal, the money belonged to employees rather than the petitioner, and no loss was suffered as the money was returned [11].

3. **NO.** The award of attorney's fees is improper because it was not shown that the petitioner acted in bad faith in terminating Rueda's services [12]. An honest misappreciation of the facts and the law does not constitute malice.

**Disposition:** The assailed Decisions and Order are **MODIFIED** by deleting the award of attorney's fees. The award of backwages and separation pay is affirmed [13].
