I. CAPTION
PIZZA HUT/PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, LABOR ARBITER SALIMATHAR NAMBI AND FROILAN RUEDA, G.R. No. 117059, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 579, Puno, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Private respondent Froilan Rueda was employed as Assistant Manager III at Pizza Hut. On February 14, 1990, acting as closing manager, he collected the day's tips amounting to P705.00 but failed to deposit them in the safety vault, keeping the money in his possession instead [2]. On February 18, the tip custodian discovered the tips were missing; Rueda admitted possession and returned the money on February 21, minus P100.00 he took as a cash advance [2].

On May 31, 1990, petitioner terminated Rueda for dishonesty and stealing under the Employee Code of Conduct [3]. Rueda filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. The Labor Arbiter ruled in Rueda's favor, awarding backwages, separation pay, and attorney's fees, though reinstatement was not ordered due to strained relations [3]. The NLRC affirmed the decision [3]. Petitioner appealed, arguing the dismissal was valid and due process was observed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N there was just cause for the dismissal of the private respondent.
2. W/N the award of attorney's fees was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal was without just cause. The totality of evidence only proved Rueda failed to deposit the tips, which does not necessarily establish theft or dishonesty [4]. The Court credited Rueda with the presumption of good faith, noting the omission was likely an oversight due to the hectic workload on Valentine's Day [4]. Furthermore, the penalty of dismissal was deemed too harsh and disproportionate because: (a) it was Rueda's first offense in 4.5 years of unblemished service; (b) the amount involved was minimal; (c) the money belonged to employees who did not complain; and (d) no loss was suffered as the money was returned [4]. Dismissal is the supreme penalty and cannot be justified where evidence is ambivalent [4].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the award of attorney's fees was improper. It found that the petitioner did not act in bad faith or with malice in terminating Rueda's services, as an honest misappreciation of facts and law does not constitute malice [5]. Additionally, the petitioner had provided Rueda with a full opportunity to defend himself [5].

Accordingly, the decision of the NLRC is MODIFIED by deleting the award of attorney's fees. The rest is AFFIRMED [5].
