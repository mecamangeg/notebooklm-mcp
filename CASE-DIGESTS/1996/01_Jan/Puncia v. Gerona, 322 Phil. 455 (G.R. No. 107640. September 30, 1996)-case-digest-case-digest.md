I. CAPTION
FAUSTINA PUNCIA AND DOMINGO BALANTES v. HON. ANTONIO N. GERONA AND ROBERTO ROCO, G.R. No. 107640, September 30, 1996, 322 Phil. 455, Vitug, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioners Puncia and Balantes were lessees of a lot in Naga City owned by private respondent Roco. In 1977, Roco filed a complaint for unlawful detainer against them for non-payment of rentals. The MTC rendered a decision in 1988 ordering petitioners to vacate, which was affirmed by the RTC and the Court of Appeals; subsequent appeals to the Supreme Court were dismissed [2]. In 1992, the MTC issued a demolition order. Petitioners challenged this before the RTC (Judge Gerona) via certiorari/prohibition, claiming the execution violated the mandatory notice and 3-year moratorium on eviction under Republic Act No. 7279 (Urban Development and Housing Act of 1992). The demolition proceeded, and the RTC dismissed the action. Petitioners filed this petition arguing the demolition order was irregular and violated RA 7279 [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the demolition of petitioners' houses violated the moratorium on eviction under Republic Act No. 7279 [4].

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that petitioners' reliance on RA 7279 is misplaced. While Section 44 of RA 7279 provides a three-year moratorium on eviction and demolition, it expressly allows exceptions for cases enumerated in Section 28. Specifically, Section 28(c) permits eviction or demolition "when there is a court order for eviction and demolition" [4]. Since the demolition here was carried out pursuant to a valid court order that had become final and executory, the moratorium did not apply. Additionally, under Rule 70, Section 8 of the Rules of Court, immediate execution in detainer actions is ministerial unless stayed by perfecting an appeal, filing a bond, and making periodic rental deposits—requirements petitioners failed to meet [5].

The petition is DISMISSED [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Padilla, Bellosillo, Kapunan, and Hermosisima, Jr., JJ., concurred [5].
