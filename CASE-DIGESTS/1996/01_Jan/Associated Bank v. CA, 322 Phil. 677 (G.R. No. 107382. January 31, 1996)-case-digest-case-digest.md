I. CAPTION
ASSOCIATED BANK v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS, PROVINCE OF TARLAC AND PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, G.R. No. 107382, January 31, 1996, 322 Phil. 677, Romero, J.

II. FACTS
The Province of Tarlac (Province) maintained a current account with the Philippine National Bank (PNB). Between 1977 and 1980, the Province issued 30 checks totaling P203,300.00 payable to "Concepcion Emergency Hospital" or its Chief. Fausto Pangilinan, the hospital’s retired administrative officer, collected the checks from the Provincial Treasurer, forged the endorsement of the Hospital Chief, Dr. Adena Canlas, and deposited them into his personal savings account with Associated Bank. Associated Bank stamped the checks "All prior endorsements guaranteed" and cleared them through PNB, which paid the amounts. Following a post-audit in 1981, the Province demanded a refund. The trial court ordered PNB to pay the Province and Associated Bank to reimburse PNB. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision *in toto*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Province of Tarlac is precluded from recovering the full amount due to its negligence.
2. W/N Associated Bank is liable to reimburse PNB for the forged endorsements.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Section 23 of the Negotiable Instruments Law (NIL), a forged signature is inoperative unless the party against whom it is enforced is precluded from setting up the forgery. While a drawee bank (PNB) is generally strictly liable for paying on a forged endorsement, the Province substantially contributed to the loss by negligently releasing checks to a retired cashier with no authority to receive them for a period of three years. Consequently, the loss is apportioned 50-50 between the negligent drawer (Province) and the banks [1].

2. **YES.** Associated Bank, as the collecting bank, warrants that the instrument is genuine and valid under Section 66 of the NIL by endorsing the check and presenting it for payment. By stamping "All prior endorsements guaranteed," Associated Bank guaranteed the forged endorsements. Furthermore, it was negligent in allowing Pangilinan to deposit checks payable to the hospital into his personal account [2]. PNB is ordered to pay 50% of P203,300.00 to the Province of Tarlac, and Associated Bank is ordered to pay 50% of P203,300.00 to PNB [3].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
