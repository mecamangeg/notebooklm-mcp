I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PATRICIO AMIGO alias "BEBOT", G.R. No. 116719, January 18, 1996, 322 Phil. 40, Melo, J.

II. FACTS
On December 29, 1989, in Davao City, Benito Ng Suy’s Ford Fiera was involved in a minor accidental collision with a Toyota Tamaraw driven by Virgilio Abogada. Accused-appellant Patricio Amigo, a passenger in the Tamaraw, intervened while the drivers were arguing. When Benito told Amigo not to interfere, Amigo stabbed Benito multiple times, causing injuries that resulted in Benito’s death three weeks later due to sepsis [1-5].

The Regional Trial Court convicted Amigo of Murder with no modifying circumstances and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* [6]. Amigo appealed, arguing that under Section 19(1), Article III of the 1987 Constitution, which was in effect during the commission of the crime, the death penalty was abolished. He contended that the penalty for murder should consequently be graduated downwards, making the correct penalty *reclusion temporal* in its medium period [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* is correctly imposed for the crime of Murder despite the suspension of the death penalty under the 1987 Constitution.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the imposition of *reclusion perpetua*.

Citing the doctrine in *People v. Muñoz*, the Court ruled that Article III, Section 19(1) of the 1987 Constitution did not abolish the death penalty but merely prohibited its imposition, reducing the penalty to *reclusion perpetua* [8, 9]. The constitutional provision did not change the periods of the penalty prescribed by Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code; the range of the medium and minimum penalties remains unchanged [9]. Therefore, in the absence of generic aggravating or mitigating circumstances, the applicable penalty is the medium period of the penalty prescribed by Article 248, which is *reclusion perpetua* [10].

The Court further held that while the penalty may seem harsh, courts have the duty to apply the law (*dura lex sed lex*), and the remedy for such harshness lies with executive clemency or legislative amendment [11].

The appealed decision is AFFIRMED [12].
