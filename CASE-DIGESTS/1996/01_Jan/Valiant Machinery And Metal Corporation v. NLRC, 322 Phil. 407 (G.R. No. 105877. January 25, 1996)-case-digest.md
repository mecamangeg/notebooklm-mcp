I. CAPTION
VALIANT MACHINERY AND METAL CORPORATION AND JIMMY LUA SING v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (FIRST DIVISION), ELENO C. PONCIANO AND FERDINAND TRIA, G.R. No. 105877, January 25, 1996, 322 Phil. 407, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondents Eleno Ponciano and Ferdinand Tria were machinists at Valiant Machinery and Metal Corp. On April 18, 1990, they obtained salary advances from petitioner Jimmy Lua Sing. They were absent the next day but reported for work on April 20 and 21. They were again absent on April 23, a Monday, utilizing a company option not to work on Mondays due to power outages. Respondents claimed that when they reported on April 24 and 25, they were barred from entering the premises. On April 26, they filed complaints for illegal dismissal.

Petitioners denied dismissing the respondents, alleging that after a request for additional cash advances was denied, the respondents went on indefinite leave and abandoned their work. The Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint, giving credence to the security guard's testimony that respondents were not barred from entry. On appeal, the NLRC reversed the decision, ruling that petitioners were guilty of constructive dismissal and ordering reinstatement with backwages.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N private respondents were illegally dismissed.
2. W/N the award of attorney’s fees is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court found substantial evidence that private respondents were dismissed without cause. While there was no formal termination notice, the respondents were effectively barred from work. The Court held that the petitioners' claim of abandonment was improbable because the respondents reported for work on April 20 and 21 after receiving their initial advances, and immediately filed a complaint for illegal dismissal on April 26 after being barred. Under the law, when there is no showing of a clear, valid, and legal cause for termination, it is considered a case of illegal dismissal, and the burden rests on the employer to prove otherwise [1]. The Court clarified that the petitioners are liable for **illegal dismissal**, not merely constructive dismissal as found by the NLRC, because the employment was terminated by the employer's act of preventing them from working, rather than the employees quitting due to unbearable conditions.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the award of attorney’s fees was improper. Under Article 2208 of the Civil Code, such fees are an exception and require a showing that the petitioners acted willfully or in bad faith, compelling the respondents to litigate. The NLRC decision failed to state the factual or legal justification for the award in the text of the decision itself [2].

**WHEREFORE**, the petition is **DENIED**. The decision of the NLRC is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the backwages shall be subject to the deduction of income earned elsewhere, and the award of attorney’s fees is **DELETED**.
