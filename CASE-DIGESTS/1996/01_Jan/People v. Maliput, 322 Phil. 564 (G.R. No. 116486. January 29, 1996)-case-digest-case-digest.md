I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RODRIGO MALIPUT Y REYES AND UNDO DAPROSA Y WATIG, G.R. No. 116486, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 564, Padilla, J. [1]

II. FACTS
On April 7, 1991, spouses Chua Chun and Ho Tin were found murdered inside their grocery in San Fernando, Pampanga. Their son, Tony Choi, saw three men fleeing the establishment via a side door: accused-appellants Rodrigo Maliput and Undo Daprosa (employees), and Jun-Jun Reyes (at large). Police later apprehended Maliput and Daprosa at 3:00 a.m. carrying their belongings. When identified by Choi, Daprosa attempted to flee into a cogonal area but was subdued. The accused claimed they fled because Reyes threatened them. The trial court convicted them of double murder and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua*. [1, 2]

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the circumstantial evidence is sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. [2]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the established circumstances constituted an unbroken chain leading to the fair and reasonable conclusion of guilt. The Court relied on the following circumstances: (1) Tony Choi positively identified the accused fleeing the scene; (2) the accused were absent during the police investigation; and (3) their flight with belongings in the wee hours, which is a clear indicium of guilt. The Court found their defense of acting under threat to be incredible. The judgment was **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that each accused is sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* for **each** murder committed and ordered to pay P50,000.00 indemnity for each victim.
