I. CAPTION
STELLAR INDUSTRIAL SERVICES, INC. v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND ROBERTO H. PEPITO, G.R. No. 117418, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 352, Regalado, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Stellar Industrial Services, Inc. employed private respondent Roberto H. Pepito as a janitor starting in 1975. On January 22, 1991, Stellar terminated Pepito for "Absent Without Official Leave (AWOL)/Virtual Abandonment" after he failed to report for work from November 2 to December 10, 1990. Pepito claimed his absence was due to severe stomach pain, stating he had informed his supervisor via telephone and subsequently submitted a medical certificate dated December 14, 1990 [1]. Pepito filed a complaint for illegal dismissal and illegal salary deductions for a "Death Aid Program." The Labor Arbiter ruled in Pepito's favor, declaring the dismissal illegal and ordering reinstatement. The NLRC affirmed the decision. Petitioner appealed, arguing the medical certificate was insufficient and that Pepito's past infractions (e.g., gambling, tardiness) justified the penalty [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Pepito was validly dismissed for AWOL/Virtual Abandonment.
2. W/N the salary deductions for the "Death Aid Program" were valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The dismissal was illegal. The Court held that Pepito substantially complied with company rules regarding sick leave by informing his supervisor and submitting a valid medical certificate, which the Court found to be regular on its face [3]. Regarding Petitioner's reliance on Pepito's previous infractions to justify the termination, the Court ruled that while past misconduct can be considered, it must be in connection with a subsequent **similar offense**. In this case, the current absence was justified by illness and was not similar to his past infractions (gambling and tardiness), which had already been penalized or condoned [3].

2. **NO.** The deductions were unlawful. The Court classified the "Death Aid Program" deduction as a special assessment. Under **Article 241(n) of the Labor Code**, no special assessment may be levied upon members unless authorized by a written resolution of a majority of **all the members** at a general membership meeting duly called for that purpose. A mere resolution by the Board of Directors is insufficient. Additionally, individual written authorization from the employee is a condition *sine qua non* for such deductions [4].

The petition is **DISMISSED** for lack of merit [5].
