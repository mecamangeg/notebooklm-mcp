I. CAPTION
EDMUNDO QUEBRAL v. COURT OF APPEALS AND UNION REFINERY CORPORATION, G.R. No. 101941, January 25, 1996, 322 Phil. 387, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Union Refinery Corporation filed a complaint for a sum of money against petitioner Edmundo Quebral and Higidio Gay-ya, Jr. for unpaid oil products amounting to P102,991.54. Union alleged that Quebral authorized Gay-ya to transact on his behalf under a credit application. After Union presented its evidence, Quebral filed a demurrer to evidence. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) granted the demurrer and dismissed the case against Quebral, holding only Gay-ya liable.

On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the RTC decision. Relying on the plaintiff's evidence—specifically the credit application and a letter (Exhibit "K") where Quebral introduced Gay-ya as his representative—the CA found Quebral liable. Quebral appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the admissibility of Exhibit "K" and the finding of liability.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is liable for the obligation following the appellate court's reversal of the demurrer to evidence.
2. W/N Exhibit "K" was admissible in evidence.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under **Rule 35, Section 1 of the Revised Rules of Court**, a defendant who files a demurrer to evidence gambles on the sufficiency of the plaintiff's case. If the trial court grants the demurrer but the appellate court reverses it, the defendant loses the right to present evidence. The appellate court must then decide the case based solely on the plaintiff's evidence. In this case, the CA correctly determined based on Union's uncontradicted evidence—the credit application and Exhibit "K"—that Quebral expressly authorized Gay-ya, making him liable for the unpaid invoices [1].

2. **YES.** An objection to documentary evidence must be made at the time the document is formally offered. Citing *Interpacific Transit, Inc. v. Aviles*, the Court ruled that petitioner failed to object to Exhibit "K" at the time of its formal offer. Since the original was produced and identified, and no timely objection was raised, the evidence was properly admitted and the petitioner is amenable to its effects [2].

The petition was **DENIED** and the decision of the Court of Appeals was **AFFIRMED** *in toto* [3].
