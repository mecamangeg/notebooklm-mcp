I. CAPTION
STELLAR INDUSTRIAL SERVICES, INC. v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND ROBERTO H. PEPITO, G.R. No. 117418, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 352, Regalado, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondent Roberto H. Pepito was employed by petitioner Stellar Industrial Services, Inc. as a janitor since 1975. From November 2 to December 10, 1990, Pepito was absent from work. He claimed he suffered severe stomach pain and could not file an official leave but informed his supervisor via telephone. On December 14, 1990, he submitted a medical certificate confirming he suffered intestinal abdominal pains and had recovered. However, petitioner rejected the certificate, labeling the illness as merely "alleged" and the certificate an "afterthought." On January 22, 1991, petitioner terminated Pepito for "Absent Without Official Leave (AWOL)/Virtual Abandonment," also citing past infractions such as gambling and tardiness from previous years. Petitioner also deducted amounts from Pepito's salary for "death aid" benefits based on a Board Resolution of the Stellar Employees Association.

Pepito filed a complaint for illegal dismissal and illegal deductions. The Labor Arbiter ruled in Pepito's favor, declaring the dismissal illegal and ordering reinstatement and the refund of deductions. The NLRC affirmed the decision. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari, arguing grave abuse of discretion regarding the issue of abandonment and the validity of the medical certificate.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N private respondent was validly dismissed for serious misconduct due to his absences.
2. W/N the salary deductions for "death aid" benefits were valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that no serious misconduct could be imputed to Pepito. While he did not secure prior written approval, he substantially complied with company rules by calling his supervisor to inform him of the illness [1]. The Court found the medical certificate valid, noting it was signed by a physician who personally examined Pepito and confirmed his recovery from "intestinal abdominal pains," not merely "alleged" pains [2]. Furthermore, petitioner could not rely on past infractions (gambling, tardiness) to justify the dismissal because they were not similar offenses to the current charge and had already been penalized or condoned [3, 4]. Abandonment was also ruled out as a non-issue since Pepito had advised the company of his absence [5].

2. **NO.** The deductions were illegal. Under Article 241(n) of the Labor Code and its implementing rules, no special assessment or extraordinary fees may be levied without a written resolution of a majority of all members at a general meeting called for that purpose [6]. A mere Board Resolution is insufficient. Additionally, a written individual authorization from the employee is a *condition sine qua non* for such deductions to be valid [7].

The petition is **DISMISSED**.
