I. CAPTION
PANTRANCO NORTH EXPRESS, INC. v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND REYNALDO M. RUEDA, G.R. No. 114333, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 256, Puno, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondent Reynaldo Rueda was employed by petitioner Pantranco North Express in 1956. He was retrenched in 1978 and received separation pay, then re-hired in 1981. In 1987, Rueda stabbed a co-employee during a quarrel. While initially recommended for dismissal due to serious misconduct, the petitioner instead approved Rueda's retirement "due to medical reasons" as he suffered from tuberculosis. Rueda protested this forced retirement.

The Labor Arbiter dismissed the case, but the NLRC reversed the decision, declaring the dismissal illegal. The NLRC ordered the payment of separation pay (in lieu of reinstatement due to the company's financial condition) computed from his original employment in 1956, treating the gap between retrenchment and re-hiring as leave without pay. Petitioner appealed, challenging the illegality of the dismissal and the computation of separation pay.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Rueda was validly dismissed on the ground of illness.
2. W/N Rueda's separation pay should be computed from his original hiring date in 1956.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the dismissal was illegal. The petitioner abandoned "serious misconduct" as a ground when it opted to retire Rueda for medical reasons. Regarding the illness, the petitioner failed to comply with **Section 8, Rule 1, Book VI of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Labor Code**. This provision requires a certification by a competent public health authority that the disease is of such nature or at such a stage that it cannot be cured within six months even with proper medical treatment. Petitioner failed to submit this certification, presenting only a radiograph report. Without the required certification, the retirement due to illness is invalid.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion in reckoning the employment from 1956. Rueda accepted his separation pay in 1978 without protest and did not question his retrenchment then. Any claim regarding the 1978 retrenchment has prescribed under **Article 1146 of the Civil Code**, which provides a four-year prescriptive period. Thus, his length of service for the purpose of separation pay must be computed only from the date he was re-hired on February 9, 1981, until the expiration of his sick leave on August 9, 1989.

The petition is **DENIED** regarding the illegal dismissal but **GRANTED** as to the modification of the separation pay computation. The NLRC decision is **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**.
