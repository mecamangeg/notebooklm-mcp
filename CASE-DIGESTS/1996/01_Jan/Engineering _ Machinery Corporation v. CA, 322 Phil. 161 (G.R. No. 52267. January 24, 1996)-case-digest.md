I. CAPTION
ENGINEERING & MACHINERY CORPORATION v. COURT OF APPEALS AND PONCIANO L. ALMEDA, G.R. No. 52267, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 161, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
On September 10, 1962, Petitioner Engineering & Machinery Corporation entered into a contract with Private Respondent Ponciano Almeda to fabricate and install a central air-conditioning system in Almeda's building for P210,000.00. The system was completed in 1963 and accepted by Almeda [1]. In 1965, Almeda sold the building but re-acquired it in 1971 via judicial rescission. Upon re-acquisition, he discovered defects in the system and commissioned a technical evaluation, which revealed that the system failed to maintain the agreed temperature and that Petitioner deviated from the plans and specifications [2, 3].

On May 8, 1971, Almeda filed an action for damages against Petitioner [3]. Petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing the contract was one of sale and the action had prescribed under the six-month period for hidden defects (Arts. 1566, 1567, 1571 Civil Code) [4]. Almeda countered that it was a contract for a piece of work (Art. 1713) subject to a ten-year prescriptive period (Art. 1144) [4]. The trial court ruled in favor of Almeda, finding the contract was for a piece of work and the action was filed within the ten-year period [5]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision in toto [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the contract for the fabrication and installation of the air-conditioning system is a contract for a piece of work.
2. W/N the action for damages has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The contract is for a piece of work. A contract is for a piece of work if the thing transferred is one not in existence and which would never have existed but for the order of the person desiring it (Art. 1713, Civil Code) [7]. If the article is manufactured for the general market in the ordinary course of business, it is a contract of sale [8]. Here, Petitioner is not in the business of manufacturing "off-the-shelf" air-conditioning systems but customizes them based on specific plans and specifications agreed upon with customers [9].

2. **NO.** The action has not prescribed. While a contract for a piece of work is generally governed by the warranty against hidden defects (Art. 1714), which has a six-month prescriptive period, the remedy here is based on **breach of contract** due to deviations from plans and specifications under Art. 1715 [10, 11]. Since Art. 1715 does not specify a prescriptive period, the general rule for actions upon a written contract applies, which is ten (10) years under Art. 1144 of the Civil Code [11]. The complaint was filed in 1971, well within 10 years from the contract execution in 1962 [11]. Furthermore, acceptance of the work does not relieve the contractor of liability for deviations not apparent at the time of delivery [12].

The petition is DENIED and the assailed Decision is AFFIRMED [12].
