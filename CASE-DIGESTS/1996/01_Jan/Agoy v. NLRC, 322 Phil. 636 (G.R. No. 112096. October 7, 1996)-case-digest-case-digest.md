I. CAPTION
MARCELINO B. AGOY v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, EUREKA PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT SERVICES, INC., ET AL., G.R. No. 112096, October 7, 1996, 322 Phil. 636, Francisco, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Marcelino Agoy applied as a Civil Engineer with respondent Eureka Personnel Management Services, Inc. and was accepted for overseas employment with Al-Khodari Establishment in Saudi Arabia as a "CE/Road Engineer" with a monthly salary of SR1,750.00 [2]. However, he was deployed as a "Foreman" with a lower salary of US$460.00 and later forced to work as a "Road Foreman" [2]. Subsequently, the employer demanded he sign a new contract with a reduced salary of SR1,200.00 or face termination; upon his refusal, he was dismissed on March 26, 1990 [2]. To facilitate his repatriation, he signed a Final Settlement and a notice of "Termination of Services Within the Probation Period" [2].

Agoy filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. The POEA dismissed the complaint, ruling that Agoy failed to meet performance standards during the probationary period and voluntarily consented to his termination [3]. On appeal, the NLRC reversed the POEA, finding the dismissal illegal [3]. However, upon a Motion for Reconsideration, the NLRC set aside its own decision and reinstated the POEA's dismissal of the complaint, ruling that Agoy failed to qualify as a regular employee [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner was illegally dismissed. [4]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the dismissal was illegal. While probationary employees have limited tenure, they are entitled to security of tenure and may only be terminated for just cause or when they fail to qualify as regular employees in accordance with reasonable standards made known by the employer to the employee at the time of his engagement, pursuant to Article 281 of the Labor Code [4].

The Court found the records bereft of evidence showing that the respondent employer conveyed the specific standards or requirements for regular employment to the petitioner at the time of engagement [4]. General averments regarding failure to meet standards are insufficient to justify dismissal, and the burden of proof rests on the employer to show that the dismissal is for just cause [4]. Furthermore, the petitioner’s signature on the notice of termination and Final Settlement did not constitute voluntary consent; quitclaims are looked upon with disfavor when executed by employees under pressure, and Agoy's immediate filing of a complaint negated the claim of voluntariness [5].

The petition was GRANTED. The NLRC Resolution was SET ASIDE and its earlier Decision dated December 9, 1992, finding the dismissal illegal and awarding petitioner SR39,674.00, was REINSTATED [5].
