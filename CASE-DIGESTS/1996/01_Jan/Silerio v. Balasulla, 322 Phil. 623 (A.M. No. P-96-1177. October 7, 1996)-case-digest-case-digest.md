I. CAPTION
JUDGE SALVADOR D. SILERIO v. IGNACIO B. BALASULLA, A.M. No. P-96-1177, October 7, 1996, 322 Phil. 623, Bellosillo, J.

II. FACTS
On December 31, 1994, the attendance logbook of the RTC Branch 8, Legaspi City disappeared [1]. During an investigation conducted by petitioner Judge Silerio on January 11, 1995, respondent Process Server Ignacio Balasulla promptly admitted to hiding the logbook [1]. Balasulla alleged that he and his co-employees conceived the idea on December 21, 1994, and he executed the plan upon the instruction of Deputy Sheriff Jose Blanca [1]. The Executive Judge recommended Balasulla's suspension and the dismissal of the charges against Blanca for insufficiency of evidence, a recommendation affirmed by the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N respondent Balasulla is administratively liable for misconduct for hiding the attendance logbook. [2]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the unauthorized taking and concealing of any court record, paper, or document within or outside the office is prohibited and administratively censurable [2]. An attendance logbook is considered a court record, and its concealment constitutes misconduct in office, violating the mandate that public office is a public trust and that court employees must safeguard the integrity and correctness of court records [2]. Although the OCA recommended a one-month suspension, the Court mitigated the penalty due to Balasulla's prompt admission of guilt and his status as a first-time offender [2]. Accordingly, Balasulla was suspended for fifteen (15) days without pay, with a warning, while the complaint against Deputy Sheriff Blanca was dismissed for lack of sufficient proof [3].
