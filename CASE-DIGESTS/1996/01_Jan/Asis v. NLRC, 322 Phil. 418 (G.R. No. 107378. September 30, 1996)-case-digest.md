I. CAPTION
REMEDIOS K. ASIS v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, VETERANS PHILIPPINES SCOUT SECURITY AGENCY and/or ENGR. SERGIO JAMILA IV, G.R. No. 107378, September 30, 1996, 322 Phil. 418, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Remedios K. Asis was employed by private respondent Security Agency as a security guard and designated as detachment commander at the Paguyo Breeder Farm of Purefoods Corporation in Sta. Rosa, Laguna [1]. On July 4, 1990, he applied for and was granted leave from July 9 to 15, 1990 [1]. Upon reporting back to work on July 16, 1990, he discovered he had been replaced and was informed of his transfer to Calauan, Laguna as an ordinary security guard [1]. Asis signed a "cancellation of official duties" but refused the new assignment, claiming it constituted a demotion and constructive dismissal [1, 2].

The Labor Arbiter ruled in favor of Asis, declaring him illegally dismissed and awarding backwages and separation pay, finding no valid reason for the transfer [3, 4]. On appeal, the NLRC reversed the decision, holding that the transfer was a valid exercise of management prerogative due to a client request and that there was no demotion in pay or benefits [5, 6]. Asis filed a petition for certiorari [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner was constructively dismissed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while management has the prerogative to transfer employees as business exigencies require, this prerogative cannot be exercised if it results in a demotion in rank or a diminution in salary, benefits, and privileges, or if done in bad faith [8].

The Court found that the transfer constituted a demotion because Asis was moved from the position of detachment commander, which carries supervisory responsibilities, to that of a mere security guard [9]. Furthermore, the transfer from Sta. Rosa to Calauan, Laguna would necessitate higher transportation expenses for the petitioner, effectively resulting in a diminution of his take-home salary [9]. The respondents also failed to provide due process, as Asis was not formally notified of the transfer or the reasons for it until he returned from leave [10]. The Court rejected the respondents' belated claim that the client requested the relief due to "negligence," deeming it self-serving [11].

The petition was **GRANTED**. The NLRC decision was set aside, and the private respondent was ordered to pay full backwages and separation pay (in lieu of reinstatement) to the petitioner [12].
