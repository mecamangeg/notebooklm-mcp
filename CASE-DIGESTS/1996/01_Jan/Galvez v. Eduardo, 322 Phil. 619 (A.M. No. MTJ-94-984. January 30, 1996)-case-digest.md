I. CAPTION
GLADY M. GALVEZ v. JUDGE GEMINIANO A. EDUARDO, METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT, GENERAL TINIO, NUEVA ECIJA, A.M. No. MTJ-94-984, January 30, 1996, 322 Phil. 619, Kapunan, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Glady M. Galvez filed an administrative complaint for grave misconduct against Respondent Judge Geminiano A. Eduardo [1]. On May 30, 1994, Respondent issued a warrant of arrest against Complainant in Criminal Case No. 3017 for Grave Threats, a case in which she was not an accused [2]. She was forced to post a P5,000.00 cash bond for her provisional liberty [2]. Respondent claimed the issuance was a clerical error committed by his staff, as he intended to issue the warrant for Criminal Case No. 3016 (Grave Oral Defamation) where Complainant was a co-accused [3]. Complainant refuted this, noting that two separate warrants were issued for the two distinct cases, negating the theory of a single clerical error [4]. The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) treated the incident as a justifiable clerical error and recommended a penalty of reprimand [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent Judge is administratively liable for the erroneous issuance of the warrant of arrest due to alleged staff negligence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the Respondent's mistake warrants more than a mere reprimand [5]. The Court emphasized that the issuance of a warrant of arrest involves a person's liberty and is not merely "usual paperwork"; the determination of probable cause and the authority to issue it rests solely with the judge [6]. The Court rejected the defense of clerical error, establishing the doctrine that a judge cannot take refuge behind the inefficiency or negligence of his court personnel [7]. Judges are directly responsible for the proper discharge of their official functions and must supervise their staff to observe high standards of professionalism [7]. Consequently, the Court found Respondent guilty of unduly subjecting Complainant to arrest when she was not an accused in the criminal case [7].
