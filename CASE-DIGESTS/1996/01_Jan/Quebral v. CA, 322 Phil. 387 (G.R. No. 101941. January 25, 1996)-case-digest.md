I. CAPTION
**EDMUNDO QUEBRAL v. COURT OF APPEALS and UNION REFINERY CORPORATION, G.R. No. 101941, January 25, 1996, 322 Phil. 387, Panganiban, J.**

II. FACTS
Union Refinery Corporation (Union) filed a complaint for a sum of money and damages against Edmundo Quebral and Higidio Gay-ya, Jr. for unpaid oil products amounting to P102,991.54. Union alleged that Quebral, through his approved credit application, and Gay-ya fraudulently sold products to third parties. During trial, after Union rested its case, Quebral filed a demurrer to evidence, arguing insufficient proof of his liability. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) granted the demurrer and dismissed the case against Quebral, while holding Gay-ya liable.

Union appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA reversed the RTC, ruling that Union had established Quebral's liability through judicial admissions and "Exhibit K," a handwritten letter by Quebral to Union's official acknowledging the transaction and Gay-ya's authority. Consequently, the CA rendered judgment ordering Quebral to pay the obligation. Quebral filed a petition for review under Rule 45, arguing the CA erred in admitting Exhibit K as it was not properly authenticated or offered.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals correctly reversed the trial court's dismissal on demurrer to evidence and held the petitioner liable without allowing him to present evidence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision. The Court held that Quebral failed to make a timely objection to "Exhibit K" at the time it was formally offered in evidence. Citing *Interpacific Transit, Inc. v. Aviles*, the Court reiterated that evidence not objected to becomes part of the case, and parties are amenable to its effects. The letter, combined with other evidence, sufficiently established Quebral's liability.

Furthermore, under **Section 1, Rule 35 of the Revised Rules of Court**, if a defendant's motion for judgment on demurrer to evidence is granted but later reversed on appeal, the movant loses his right to present evidence in his behalf. By filing a demurrer, Quebral gambled his right to adduce evidence. Since the appellate court found Union's evidence sufficient to establish a claim, judgment was properly rendered against Quebral based solely on the plaintiff's evidence.

The petition was **DENIED** and the decision of the Court of Appeals was **AFFIRMED** in toto.
