I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DEMETRIO HUBILLA, JR. AND SALVADOR PALLE, G.R. No. 114904, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 520, Davide, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
On June 14, 1991, in Sta. Cruz, Casiguran, Sorsogon, CAFGU members Demetrio Hubilla, Jr. and Salvador Palle confronted Antonio Rosas. Prosecution eyewitness Reynaldo Halcon testified that he saw the accused poking their M-14 rifles at Rosas, commanding him to lower his hoe. When Rosas refused, Hubilla shot him near the feet. As Rosas attempted to run away, Hubilla shot him again, hitting him in the neck and killing him. Palle did not fire his weapon but pointed it at the victim during the confrontation.

The accused claimed self-defense, alleging that Rosas suddenly attacked them with a hoe, disarming Palle, which forced Hubilla to shoot. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Sorsogon gave no credence to this defense, finding it improbable that a man with a hoe would attack two fully armed men. The RTC convicted both accused of Murder and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua*. They appealed, challenging the credibility of the eyewitness and insisting on self-defense.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused validly invoked self-defense.
2. W/N conspiracy existed between Hubilla and Palle.
3. W/N the crime committed was Murder.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** When an accused admits to the killing but invokes self-defense, the burden of evidence shifts to them to prove the elements of: (1) unlawful aggression; (2) reasonable necessity of means; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation [1]. The Court found the defense version contrived and "flimsy," agreeing with the trial court that it is unlikely for a person armed only with a hoe to attack two CAFGU members armed with M-14 rifles [2]. Furthermore, physical evidence showed the bullet entered the victim's left jaw/neck, contradicting the defense claim that the victim was facing them in an attack, and supporting the witness's testimony that the victim was shot while trying to run [3, 4].

2. **YES.** Conspiracy exists when the acts of the accused point to a joint purpose and concerted action [4]. Although Palle did not fire the fatal shot, he poked his rifle at the victim, helping Hubilla intimidate him, and fled with Hubilla after the shooting. His armed presence gave encouragement and a sense of security to the assailant. Thus, his liability is that of a co-conspirator, where the act of one is the act of all [5].

3. **NO.** The Court modified the conviction to **Homicide**. Treachery was not present because the victim was forewarned of the attack when the accused poked their rifles at him and fired a shot near his feet before the fatal shot. There is no treachery when the victim is put on guard or when the attack is not so sudden as to catch the deceased completely unaware [6]. Evident premeditation was also not proven, as the encounter was casual and the attack was made on the spur of the moment [7].

**Disposition:** The judgment is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The accused are found guilty of HOMICIDE and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years of *prision mayor* minimum, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months of *reclusion temporal* minimum, as maximum [8].
