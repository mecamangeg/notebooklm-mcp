I. CAPTION
SPS. CAMILO Y. GO AND DELIA L. GO v. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. MARCELINO F. BAUTISTA, JR. AND MANUELA REALTY DEVELOPMENT CORP., G.R. No. 120040, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 613, Francisco, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Spouses Go obtained a loan of P93,200.00 from respondent Manuela Realty Development Corp. (Manuela), secured by a real estate mortgage. Claiming non-payment, Manuela extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage and consolidated ownership. Petitioners filed a suit and moved for summary judgment, which the trial court denied upon finding that genuine issues of fact existed [1]. Petitioners then filed a petition for mandamus with the Court of Appeals (CA) to compel the trial court to render summary judgment. The CA dismissed the petition, ruling that substantial triable issues—specifically regarding the amount paid, the existence of default, and the validity of the foreclosure—required a trial [1]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a writ of mandamus may issue to compel the trial court to render a summary judgment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** Mandamus lies only to compel the performance of a ministerial duty, not a discretionary one [2]. The propriety of rendering a summary judgment under the Rules of Court rests on the sound exercise of the court’s discretion [2]. Petitioners failed to establish a mandatory duty on the part of the trial court to render such judgment or a clear legal right to it [2]. Furthermore, summary judgment is proper only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law [3]. In this case, the pleadings raised genuine factual issues regarding alleged overpayment, breach of obligation, and the validity of the extrajudicial foreclosure, which require the presentation of evidence during a trial [3]. The petition is DENIED and the appealed decision is AFFIRMED [3].
