I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, HOUSING AND LAND USE REGULATORY BOARD, ALFONSO MAGLAYA, et al., G.R. No. 104528, January 18, 1996, 322 Phil. 6, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondents were installment buyers of subdivision lots from Marikina Village, Inc. (developer). Unknown to the buyers, the developer mortgaged the lots to petitioner Philippine National Bank (PNB) on December 18, 1975 [1]. When the developer defaulted, PNB foreclosed on the mortgage and acquired the lots as the highest bidder [1]. The buyers filed suits, and the HLURB ruled that PNB could only collect the remaining amortizations from the buyers and must issue titles upon full payment, citing Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 957 [2]. The Office of the President affirmed this ruling [2]. PNB appealed, arguing that P.D. 957, enacted on July 12, 1976, cannot be applied retroactively to a mortgage executed in 1975, and that PNB is not privy to the contracts between the developer and the buyers [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N P.D. 957 applies retroactively to the mortgage executed prior to its enactment [2].
2. W/N PNB is bound to accept the buyers' remaining amortizations despite not being privy to the purchase agreements [3].

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** P.D. 957 is intended to protect innocent lot buyers from fraudulent manipulations by developers, such as the failure to deliver titles free from liens [3]. While laws generally have no retroactive effect under Article 4 of the Civil Code, the intent of P.D. 957 to operate retroactively is inferred from its preamble and Sections 20, 21, and 23, which cover transactions prior to the decree [3]. As a valid exercise of police power, the State's protection of public welfare prevails over the non-impairment clause (*Juarez v. Court of Appeals*) [3].

2. **YES.** PNB, as a financial institution with vast resources, is presumed to have conducted due diligence and cannot claim to be unaware of the buyers' rights [3]. Even if PNB was not privy to the contracts, the police power inherent in P.D. 957 supersedes the mortgage rights.

The petition is **DENIED**.
