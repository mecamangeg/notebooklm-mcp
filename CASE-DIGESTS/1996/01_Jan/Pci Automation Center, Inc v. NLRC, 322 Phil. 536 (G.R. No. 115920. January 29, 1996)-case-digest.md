I. CAPTION
PCI AUTOMATION CENTER, INC. v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION and HECTOR SANTELICES, G.R. No. 115920, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 536, Puno, J.

II. FACTS
In 1985, Philippine Commercial International Bank (PCIB) entered into a Computer Services Agreement with petitioner PCI Automation Center, Inc. (PCI-AC) to supervise its computer conversion project. To secure manpower, PCIB engaged Prime Manpower Resources Development, Inc. (Prime) through an External Job Contract. Private respondent Hector Santelices was hired by Prime and assigned to PCI-AC as a data encoder.

In 1991, Prime terminated Santelices claiming his services were no longer needed as the project was completed. Santelices filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. The Labor Arbiter ruled the dismissal illegal, finding the project had not yet finished, and held Prime and PCI-AC solidarily liable for backwages and separation pay. The NLRC affirmed the decision. PCI-AC appealed, arguing the project was completed and that it was not Santelices' employer, as he was an employee of Prime merely assigned to the project.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Santelices was validly dismissed due to project completion.
2. W/N PCI-AC is solidarily liable with Prime for the monetary claims of the private respondent.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The factual findings of the Labor Arbiter and NLRC, supported by substantial evidence, established that the project was not yet completed at the time of dismissal. The Assistant Vice-President of Prime expressly testified that the specific phase (Tower II) to which Santelices was assigned was still ongoing [1, 2]. Thus, there was no valid ground for dismissal.

2. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed that Prime was engaged in "labor-only" contracting under Article 106 of the Labor Code [3]. Prime merely acted as a placement agency supplying manpower to PCI-AC through PCIB, rather than performing a specific job on its own account [4]. In labor-only contracting, the person supplying workers is considered merely an agent, and the principal (PCI-AC) is treated by law as the direct employer responsible to the employees as if they were directly hired [5]. Consequently, PCI-AC is solidarily liable with the contractor for all rightful claims of the employees [5, 6]. The Court dismissed the petition and affirmed the NLRC decision [7].
