**I. CAPTION**
FELICIDAD V. MORALES v. JULIO G. TARONGOY, A.M. No. P-94-1032, January 18, 1996, 322 Phil. 1, Per Curiam.

**II. FACTS**
Complainant Felicidad Morales obtained a favorable NLRC judgment awarding her P190,254.00 against her employer [1]. To enforce the alias writ of execution, she approached Respondent Deputy Sheriff Julio Tarongoy of the RTC Pagadian City. Tarongoy demanded P15,000.00 as a fee for implementation, a portion of which Morales paid [1]. In executing the writ, Tarongoy levied on two parcels of land that were already mortgaged for P2 million and P7 million, respectively, despite the judgment being only for P190,000.00 [2]. He failed to check for unencumbered properties, rendering the levy useless [2]. Morales filed a complaint for Grave Misconduct and Violation of R.A. 3019 [3]. During the administrative proceedings, the Supreme Court issued two resolutions requiring Tarongoy to comment, but he failed to comply despite receiving them [4]. The Office of the Court Administrator recommended a three-month suspension, noting his admission of the charges by silence [5, 6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Respondent Sheriff is guilty of Grave Misconduct warranting dismissal from service.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court found Respondent guilty of Grave Misconduct. While sheriffs are authorized to collect fees, they must first submit a bill of costs to the court for approval; Respondent’s arbitrary demand for P15,000.00 was improper [2]. Furthermore, Respondent failed to discharge his duties with prudence and caution by levying on heavily mortgaged properties instead of verifying if unencumbered assets existed, which defeated the purpose of the execution [2].

Crucially, the Court held that Respondent’s continued disregard of its resolutions requiring him to comment was not only indicative of guilt but constituted defiance that cannot be countenanced [7]. Noting that Respondent had previously been found guilty of negligence in A.M. No. P-90-468, the Court ordered his **DISMISSAL** from the service with forfeiture of all benefits and prejudice to re-employment [6, 7].
