I. CAPTION
MAGNOLIA DAIRY PRODUCTS CORPORATION v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND JENNY A. CALIBO, G.R. No. 114952, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 508, Francisco, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Magnolia Dairy Products Corporation entered into contracts of service with Skillpower, Inc. and Lippercon Services, Inc., both manpower service agencies. Private respondent Jenny A. Calibo was assigned by these agencies to petitioner’s Tetra Paster Division from 1983 to 1987 to perform functions such as removing damaged goods, re-pasting cartons, and cleaning contaminated premises. In December 1987, petitioner dismissed Calibo due to the installation of automated machines. Calibo filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. Petitioner argued there was no employer-employee relationship as the agencies were independent contractors, and that the dismissal was for an authorized cause.

The Labor Arbiter ruled that the agencies were "labor-only" contractors, making petitioner the real employer. It held the dismissal valid due to the installation of labor-saving devices but ordered the payment of backwages and separation pay for failure to observe due process. The NLRC modified the decision, ordering Calibo's reinstatement and payment of backwages.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N an employer-employee relationship exists between petitioner and private respondent.
2. W/N private respondent was illegally dismissed and entitled to reinstatement and backwages.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the findings that Skillpower, Inc. and Lippercon Services, Inc. were engaged in "labor-only" contracting. The workers supplied performed services that were usual, regular, and necessary for petitioner's business of producing goods. They utilized petitioner's premises, tools, and equipment, and petitioner exercised the power to discipline them. Under the law, where labor-only contracting exists, the principal is responsible to the employees of the contractor as if they were directly employed by the principal. Thus, an employer-employee relationship existed between petitioner and Calibo.

2. **NO.** The termination was based on a valid authorized cause under Article 283 of the Labor Code, specifically the installation of labor-saving devices. Management has the prerogative to install such devices, and there was no showing of bad faith. Consequently, the awards of reinstatement and backwages are improper; the correct award is separation pay equivalent to one (1) month pay for every year of service. However, petitioner failed to comply with the mandatory one-month written notice to the employee and the DOLE. Following the doctrine in *Wenphil Corp. v. NLRC*, this failure does not make the dismissal illegal but renders it defective, subjecting the employer to a sanction.

The petition is **GRANTED** in part. The NLRC decision is **MODIFIED**: the award of reinstatement and backwages is set aside. Petitioner is ordered to pay separation pay and an indemnity of P5,000.00 for failure to observe due process.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
