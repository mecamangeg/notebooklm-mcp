I. CAPTION
CEFERINO S. PAREDES, JR. AND MANSUETO J. HONRADA v. THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN (SECOND DIVISION), et al., G.R. No. 108251, January 31, 1996, 322 Phil. 709, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Teofilo Gelacio filed a complaint against petitioners Governor Ceferino Paredes, Jr., Clerk of Court Mansueto Honrada, and Atty. Generoso Sansaet for falsification of public documents. Gelacio alleged that Honrada, in conspiracy with Paredes and Sansaet, certified court records (Notice of Arraignment and Transcript of Stenographic Notes) to make it appear that Paredes had been arraigned in a perjury case (Criminal Case No. 1393) to support a motion to dismiss a separate graft case (Criminal Case No. 13800) on the ground of double jeopardy [1], [2].

During the preliminary investigation, Sansaet initially corroborated the claim that an arraignment occurred. However, he later retracted, admitting in an affidavit that no arraignment took place and the documents were falsified [3], [4]. Consequently, the Ombudsman approved the filing of three informations for Falsification of Public Documents against the petitioners in the Sandiganbayan [5]. Petitioners moved for reinvestigation, arguing due process violations because the resolution was prepared by an officer (Violan) who did not conduct the initial investigation (Axalan). They also alleged forum-shopping and political harassment [6]. The Sandiganbayan denied the motions, prompting this petition for certiorari [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioners were denied due process because the resolution recommending charges was prepared by an investigating officer who did not conduct the preliminary investigation.
2. W/N the filing of the criminal cases constituted forum-shopping given prior related cases.
3. W/N the prosecution should be enjoined on the ground of political harassment.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the fact that the resolution was prepared by an officer who did not take part in the investigation does not violate due process. This situation is similar to a judge rendering a decision in a case heard by a predecessor; what is important is that the officer decides on the basis of the evidence in the record [8].

2. **NO.** The mere filing of several cases based on the same incident does not necessarily constitute forum-shopping; the test is whether they involve the same transactions, essential facts, and circumstances [9]. Here, while the perjury, graft, and falsification cases all stemmed from Paredes' land patent application, they involved substantially different facts and causes of action [10]. Furthermore, the dismissal of an administrative case does not bar the filing of a criminal prosecution for the same acts [11].

3. **NO.** Political motivation is not a ground to prohibit criminal prosecution if there is evidence to support the charges [12]. The Court generally will not interfere with the Ombudsman's investigatory discretion unless clearly abused [13]. Petitioners failed to show that the public prosecutor acted in bad faith or that the charges were manifestly false to warrant judicial intervention [14].

The petition is DISMISSED [15].
