I. CAPTION
KELLY R. WICKER and ATTY. ORLANDO A. RAYOS v. HON. PAUL T. ARCANGEL, as Presiding Judge of the RTC, Makati, Branch 134, G.R. No. 112869, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 476, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Kelly Wicker and his counsel, Atty. Orlando Rayos, filed a Motion for Inhibition against respondent Judge Paul Arcangel in a civil case. The motion alleged that the previous judge, who had a "full grasp" of the case, was "eased out" and that respondent Judge was "personally recruited" by the opposing counsel. Finding these allegations derogatory and offensive, respondent Judge issued an order declaring petitioners guilty of direct contempt, sentencing them to five (5) days imprisonment and a fine of P100.00 each. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that Atty. Rayos was merely acting as a "mouthpiece" for his client and should not be penalized for statements he was instructed to make [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioners are liable for direct contempt for the statements made in their Motion for Inhibition.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The statements implying the judge was "personally recruited" by the opposing party were derogatory, offensive, and malicious, constituting **direct contempt** under Rule 71, Section 1 of the Rules of Court [2]. The Court rejected Atty. Rayos' defense that he was merely a "mouthpiece," ruling that a lawyer owes a primary duty of respect to the courts under **Canon 11 of the Code of Professional Responsibility** and must not attribute unsupported motives to a judge [3].

However, adhering to the principle that the power to cite for contempt must be exercised for **preservation rather than vindication**, and considering petitioner Wicker's advanced age (80), failing health, and apology, the Court deleted the jail sentence [3]. Citing *Ceniza v. Sebastian*, the Court held that the dignity of the court could be vindicated by a fine alone [3]. The petition is **GRANTED** in part; the order is **MODIFIED** by deleting the imprisonment and increasing the fine to P200.00 for each petitioner [4].
