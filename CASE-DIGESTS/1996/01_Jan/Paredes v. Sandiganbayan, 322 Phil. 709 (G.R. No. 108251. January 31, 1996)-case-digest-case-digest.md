I. CAPTION
CEFERINO S. PAREDES, JR. AND MANSUETO J. HONRADA v. THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN (SECOND DIVISION), HON. ANIANO DESIERTO, and HON. CONRADO M. VASQUEZ, G.R. No. 108251, January 31, 1996, 322 Phil. 709, Mendoza, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioners Paredes and Honrada faced criminal charges involving Perjury, Anti-Graft, and Falsification stemming from a land application incident. They filed motions to quash and for reinvestigation before the Sandiganbayan, arguing that: (1) the resolution charging them was prepared by an officer (Violan) who did not conduct the preliminary investigation; (2) the prosecutors were biased; and (3) the cases constituted political harassment and forum shopping. The Sandiganbayan denied these motions and set the case for trial. Petitioners subsequently filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition to enjoin the criminal proceedings. [2, 3]

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioners were denied due process because the resolution was prepared by an officer who did not conduct the preliminary investigation.
2. W/N the prosecutors were disqualified due to bias.
3. W/N the prosecution is barred by forum shopping.
4. W/N the criminal prosecution should be enjoined due to political harassment. [2, 4]

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the fact that the resolution was prepared by an officer who did not conduct the hearing does not violate due process. Analogous to a judge rendering a decision based on evidence heard by a predecessor, what is essential is that the decision-maker acts on the basis of the evidence in the record. [4]

2. **NO.** Mere divergence of opinion regarding the weight of evidence, such as giving credence to a retraction, is not proof of bias. A public prosecutor represents the sovereignty's interest that justice be done and is not disqualified simply because he prosecuted a previous case against the accused; it cannot be assumed he has lost objectivity. [3]

3. **NO.** Forum shopping exists only when actions involve the same transactions, essential facts, and circumstances. Although the cases for Perjury, Anti-Graft, and Falsification arose from the same incident regarding a land application, they involve fundamentally different facts, issues, and causes of action. Furthermore, absolution in an administrative case does not bar criminal prosecution for the same acts. [3]

4. **NO.** The alleged political motivation of a complainant cannot justify enjoining a criminal prosecution if there is evidence to support the charges. The determination of probable cause belongs to the prosecutor, and the exceptions warranting judicial intervention enumerated in *Brocka v. Enrile* were not present. Petitioners failed to prove the public prosecutors acted in bad faith. [5]

The petition is DENIED. [5]
