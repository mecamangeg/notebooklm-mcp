I. CAPTION
FELICIDAD V. MORALES v. JULIO G. TARONGOY, A.M. No. P-94-1032, January 18, 1996, 322 Phil. 1, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
Complainant Felicidad Morales obtained a favorable judgment from the NLRC against her employer for P190,254.00 [1]. Respondent Deputy Sheriff Julio Tarongoy demanded P15,000.00 as an execution fee without submitting a Bill of Costs to the court for approval, and Morales paid a portion of this amount [1]. In implementing the writ, Respondent levied on two parcels of land that were already mortgaged for P2 million and P7 million, respectively [1]. This rendered the levy useless given the small judgment amount, despite the existence of other unencumbered properties [1]. Respondent failed to comment on the complaint despite receiving two resolutions from the Supreme Court, which the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) noted as an admission of the charges [1]. Respondent had previously been fined and warned in A.M. No. P-90-468 regarding negligence [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent Deputy Sheriff is guilty of grave misconduct and negligence in the performance of his duties. [2]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court found the charges meritorious. Under the law, while sheriffs are allowed to collect fees, they must require the prevailing party to submit a Bill of Costs to the court for approval prior to collection; Respondent’s demand for money without this procedure was improper [2]. Furthermore, Respondent committed grave misconduct by levying on properties mortgaged for amounts far exceeding the judgment debt (P9 million vs. P190,254.00), which rendered the levy useless, especially since he failed to verify encumbrances or levy on other available unencumbered properties [2]. This demonstrated a failure to discharge duties with prudence and caution [2]. Additionally, his failure to comply with Court directives to comment on the complaint was deemed an admission of the charges [2]. Noting his prior infraction where he was warned that future offenses would be dealt with severely, the Court held him administratively liable [2].
