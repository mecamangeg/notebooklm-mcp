I. CAPTION
BELINDA TAREDO, FOR HERSELF AND IN REPRESENTATION OF HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS, AND TEOFILA CORPUZ TANEDO v. THE COURT OF APPEALS AND SPOUSES RICARDO M. TAREDO AND TERESITA BARERA TAREDO, G.R. No. 104482, January 27, 1997, 322 Phil. 84, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
On October 20, 1962, Lazaro Tañedo executed a deed of sale in favor of his brother, respondent Ricardo Taredo, and the latter’s wife, conveying "future inheritance" from his parents [1]. Upon the death of his father, Lazaro executed an "Affidavit of Conformity" on February 28, 1980, to validate the 1962 sale [1].

On December 29, 1980, Lazaro executed a deed of sale in favor of his children (petitioners) covering the same property [1, 2]. However, on January 13, 1981, Lazaro executed another deed of sale in favor of respondents covering his 1/12 undivided share [1]. Respondents registered this sale with the Registry of Deeds on June 7, 1982 [1]. Petitioners filed a complaint for rescission, claiming ownership based on the earlier 1980 sale [2]. The RTC ruled in favor of respondents, and the CA affirmed, holding that the 1981 sale was valid and its registration in good faith vested title in respondents [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 1962 sale of future inheritance is valid.
2. W/N the respondents are the rightful owners of the property under the rules on double sales.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that pursuant to Article 1347 of the Civil Code, "no contract may be entered into upon a future inheritance except in cases expressly authorized by law" [4]. Consequently, the 1962 contract is void and cannot be the source of any right or obligation [4]. The "Affidavit of Conformity" executed in 1980 to ratify the void 1962 sale is likewise useless and void [5].

2. **YES.** The case involves a double sale of immovable property governed by Article 1544 of the Civil Code [6]. Under this provision, ownership belongs to the person acquiring it who in good faith first recorded it in the Registry of Property [6]. Although the deed of sale in favor of respondents (January 13, 1981) was executed later than the one in favor of petitioners (December 29, 1980), ownership vested in respondents because they registered the sale on June 7, 1982, whereas petitioners never registered their sale [5, 7]. The Court upheld the lower courts' factual finding that respondents registered the sale in good faith [8].

The petition is **DENIED** and the CA decision is **AFFIRMED** [9].
