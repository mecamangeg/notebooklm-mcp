I. CAPTION
ALFONSO BALMS, RUDACIANO ESTONILO AND ALFEO LOTILLA v. HON. TIRSO D’C. VELASCO AND CENTRAL TEXTILE MILLS, INC., G.R. No. 118491, October 21, 1996, 322 Phil. 790, Hermosisima, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
A labor dispute between respondent Central Textile Mills, Inc. (CTMI) and its supervisors union was referred to Voluntary Arbitrator (VA) Jesus Sebastian, who ordered a wage increase. When CTMI failed to comply, the VA issued an alias writ of execution. Petitioners-sheriffs levied on CTMI's "scrap" materials and machinery, which were sold at auction to petitioner Lotilla for P263,000.

Subsequently, CTMI filed a civil case for damages with preliminary injunction before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City (presided by respondent Judge Velasco). CTMI alleged that the petitioners unlawfully dismantled and removed serviceable machinery and real property not included in the levy, and continued doing so even after the writ was returned "fully satisfied." The RTC denied petitioners' motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds and issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) and writ of preliminary injunction against them. Petitioners sought certiorari, arguing the RTC lacked jurisdiction over incidents arising from a labor dispute.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Regional Trial Court has jurisdiction over a complaint for damages and injunction arising from the alleged irregular execution of a Voluntary Arbitrator's award in a labor case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the voluntary arbitrator retains exclusive jurisdiction over incidents affecting the implementation of the writ of execution.

The Court held that the proceedings in the RTC were essentially an offshoot or incident of the enforcement of a final labor decision. Under the doctrine established in *Pucan v. Bengzon*, acts of sheriffs or officials enforcing labor awards are part of the labor dispute, and jurisdiction belongs to the labor tribunals (DOLE/NLRC/VA), not regular courts. The power of the voluntary arbitrator to issue a writ of execution carries with it the power to inquire into the correctness of its execution and control its own processes. Any irregularities in the enforcement of the writ should have been litigated before the Voluntary Arbitrator, not the RTC, to avoid "split jurisdiction" which is obnoxious to the orderly administration of justice.

The Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition was GRANTED, and the lower court was permanently enjoined from acting on the civil case.
