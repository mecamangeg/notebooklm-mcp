I. CAPTION
VALIANT MACHINERY AND METAL CORPORATION AND JIMMY LUA SING v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (FIRST DIVISION), ELENO C. PONCIANO AND FERDINAND TRIA, G.R. No. 105877, January 25, 1996, 322 Phil. 407, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondents Eleno Ponciano and Ferdinand Tria, machinists for petitioner Valiant Machinery, obtained salary advances on April 18, 1990. They reported for work on April 20 and 21 but were absent on April 23 due to a company rule regarding power outages. When they attempted to work on April 24 and 25, they were barred from entering the premises [1]. They immediately filed a complaint for illegal dismissal on April 26, 1990. Petitioners claimed respondents abandoned their work after being denied additional cash advances [2]. The Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint, crediting the security guard's testimony that respondents were not barred. The NLRC reversed the Arbiter, ruling that petitioners were guilty of constructive dismissal to avoid paying separation pay, and awarded reinstatement, backwages, and attorney's fees [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N private respondents were illegally dismissed.
2. W/N the award of attorney's fees is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that respondents were dismissed without valid cause. The petitioners' claim that respondents went on indefinite leave (abandonment) was improbable because they had reported for work on April 20 and 21 after receiving the advances [3]. Furthermore, the immediate filing of the complaint for illegal dismissal on April 26 negates the theory of abandonment [3]. In termination cases, the burden of proof rests upon the employer to show that the dismissal is for a valid cause [3]. The Court clarified that this was a case of actual illegal dismissal, rather than just constructive dismissal, because the respondents were physically barred from entering the workplace [3].

2. **NO.** The award of attorney's fees must be deleted. While Article 2208 of the Civil Code allows for attorney's fees when a party is compelled to litigate due to unjustified acts, the text of the decision itself must state the factual and legal justification for the award [4]. It is not enough to include the award in the dispositive portion; the body of the decision must explain the basis. Since the NLRC decision failed to state the reasons for the award in its text, it cannot be sustained [4].

The petition is **DISMISSED**. The NLRC decision is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the award of attorney's fees is deleted [4].
