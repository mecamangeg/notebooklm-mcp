I. CAPTION
ASSOCIATED BANK v. COURT OF APPEALS, PROVINCE OF TARLAC and PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, G.R. No. 107382, January 31, 1996, 322 Phil. 677, Romero, J.

II. FACTS
The Province of Tarlac (Province) maintained a current account with the Philippine National Bank (PNB). From 1977 to 1980, the Province issued 30 checks amounting to P203,300.00 payable to Concepcion Emergency Hospital. Fausto Pangilinan, the hospital's administrative officer and cashier, collected these checks from the Provincial Treasurer's office. Even after retiring in 1978, Pangilinan continued to collect the checks for three years. He forged the signature of the hospital chief, Dr. Adena Canlas, and deposited the checks into his personal savings account with Associated Bank. Associated Bank stamped the checks "All prior endorsements guaranteed" and presented them to PNB, which cleared and paid them. During a post-audit in 1981, the Province discovered the forgeries and demanded a refund from PNB. PNB refused and demanded reimbursement from Associated Bank. The RTC ordered PNB to pay the Province the full amount and Associated Bank to reimburse PNB. The CA affirmed the decision in toto.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Province of Tarlac (drawer) is liable for the loss due to its negligence.
2. W/N Associated Bank (collecting bank) is liable to the drawee bank (PNB) for the forged indorsements.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Province of Tarlac was negligent in releasing checks to Pangilinan, a retired employee, for nearly three years, and in allowing two different persons (Pangilinan and the new cashier) to collect checks for the same payee. This negligence "substantially contributed" to the loss. While a drawee bank generally bears the loss for paying a check with a forged indorsement, the drawer’s negligence can preclude it from setting up the forgery or entitle the drawee to reduced liability. The Court ruled that the Province must share 50% of the loss.

2. **YES.** Under Section 66 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, a collecting bank warrants that the instrument is genuine and valid at the time of its indorsement. By stamping "All prior endorsements guaranteed," Associated Bank guaranteed the forged indorsements of the payee. As the party taking the check from the forger, the collecting bank is in the best position to detect the fraud. Consequently, Associated Bank must bear the loss incurred by PNB. However, since the Province must bear 50% of the loss, Associated Bank is liable to reimburse PNB only for the remaining 50% paid to the Province.

**Disposition:** The petition of PNB is PARTIALLY GRANTED and Associated Bank's petition is DENIED. PNB is ordered to pay the Province of Tarlac 50% of P203,300.00. Associated Bank is ordered to pay PNB 50% of P203,300.00. Both payments shall earn legal interest from March 20, 1981.
