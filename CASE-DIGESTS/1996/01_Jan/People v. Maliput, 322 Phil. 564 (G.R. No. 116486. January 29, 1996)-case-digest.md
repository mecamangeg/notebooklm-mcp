I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RODRIGO MALIPUT Y REYES AND UNDO DAPROSA Y WATIG, G.R. No. 116486, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 564, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On April 7, 1991, in San Fernando, Pampanga, spouses Chua Chun and Ho Tin, owners of Popong’s Grocery, were brutally killed [1]. Their son, Tony Choi, and his wife saw three men—former employee "Jun-Jun" and current employees Rodrigo Maliput and Undo Daprosa—scampering out of the alley beside the grocery [2]. Upon checking, Tony found his mother hogtied and suffocated with a sack, and his father hogtied with his throat slashed [3], [4].

Police later found Maliput and Daprosa at the Gapan-Olongapo road junction waiting for a bus to Manila [5]. When approached, Daprosa fled into a cogonal area and was captured only after warning shots were fired [6]. The accused raised the defense of denial and alibi, claiming Jun-Jun threatened them, forcing them to leave [7], [8]. The trial court convicted them of double murder and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua* [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the circumstantial evidence is sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused-appellants beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, ruling that while there was no direct evidence of the actual killing, the established circumstances constituted an unbroken chain pointing to the accused's guilt to the exclusion of all other hypotheses [10].

The Court applied the rule that circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if: (1) there is more than one circumstance; (2) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (3) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt. Here, the key circumstances included: (a) Tony Choi's positive identification of the accused fleeing the crime scene seconds before the bodies were discovered [11]; (b) their absence from their quarters immediately after the crime [10]; and (c) their flight and attempt to evade arrest, which is a clear *indicium* of guilt [12], [10]. The Court found their alibi of being threatened by Jun-Jun incredible and noted the extreme cruelty and abuse of superior strength employed against the elderly, unarmed victims [13], [14].

The appealed judgment is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that each accused-appellant shall suffer the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* for *each* crime of murder committed, and they are ordered to pay P50,000.00 as indemnity for the death of each victim [14].
