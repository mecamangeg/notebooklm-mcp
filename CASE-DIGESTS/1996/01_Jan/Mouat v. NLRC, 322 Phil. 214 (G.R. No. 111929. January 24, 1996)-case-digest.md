I. CAPTION
AMERICAN HOME ASSURANCE CO., INC. AND/OR LESLIE J. MOUAT v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (FIRST DIVISION), LABOR ARBITER MANUEL R. CADAY, VIRGILIO MALINAO, ROSEMILO GACUSAN AND DOMINADOR LORIAGA, G.R. No. 111929, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 214, Regalado, J.

II. FACTS
Private respondents Malinao, Gacusan, and Loriaga filed complaints for regularization and money claims against petitioners. Petitioners moved to dismiss regarding Malinao and Gacusan, alleging they had settled the case via a compromise agreement. Malinao and Gacusan opposed, claiming undue influence. The Labor Arbiter (LA) denied the dismissal but ordered Malinao and Gacusan to return the money they received under the settlement as a condition for proceeding.

When they failed to return the money, the LA dismissed their case with prejudice on April 30, 1992. Respondent Loriaga also moved to dismiss his own case without prejudice, which the LA granted. On August 10, 1992, the respondents' new counsel received the LA’s dismissal order. However, it was only on December 14, 1992—more than four months later—that Malinao filed a "Motion to Admit Motion for Reconsideration." The NLRC treated this as an appeal and set aside the LA's dismissal, ordering a hearing on the merits for all respondents (including Gacusan, who did not appeal, and Loriaga, who voluntarily dismissed his case), citing "substantial justice" and the respondents' poverty.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in giving due course to the motion for reconsideration filed beyond the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the NLRC lacked jurisdiction to entertain the motion.

Under **Article 223 of the Labor Code**, decisions of the Labor Arbiter become final and executory unless appealed within ten (10) calendar days from receipt. In this case, respondents' counsel received the order on August 10, 1992, but filed the motion only on December 14, 1992, way beyond the 10-day period. The Court rejected the NLRC's invocation of "substantial justice" and the litigant's poverty, ruling that these cannot excuse the gross negligence of counsel in failing to file on time. The client is bound by the acts of their counsel.

Furthermore, the Court found the NLRC's ruling regarding the other respondents baseless:
1.  **Gacusan** never joined Malinao’s motion, had accepted P50,000, and executed a quitclaim; thus, the dismissal was final as to him.
2.  **Loriaga** voluntarily moved to dismiss his own case without prejudice; it was absurd for the NLRC to reinstate a case he himself sought to dismiss.
3.  The LA was justified in dismissing Malinao and Gacusan’s complaints for failure to comply with the condition precedent to return the settlement money.

The petition is **GRANTED**. The NLRC resolution is SET ASIDE, and the Labor Arbiter’s Order dismissing the case is REINSTATED.
