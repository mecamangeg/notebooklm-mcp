I. CAPTION
DR. ANTONIO L. AZORES v. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND PHILIPPINE COLUMBIAN ASSOCIATION, G.R. No. 112337, September 23, 1996, 322 Phil. 425, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Dr. Antonio Azores was a member of the Philippine Columbian Association (PCA). In 1966, he migrated to the United States, became an American citizen, and ceased paying membership dues [1]. Upon returning to the Philippines in 1981, he sought to reactivate his membership. The PCA informed him his certificates were cancelled but offered reinstatement for one share, conditioned on paying back dues [1]. Objecting to the forfeiture of his second share, Azores filed a complaint with the SEC. The SEC Hearing Officer ruled in favor of the PCA, and Azores' Motion for Reconsideration was denied on October 15, 1992 [2]. The 30-day period to appeal expired on October 17, 1992, a Saturday. Azores filed his Notice and Memorandum of Appeal on Tuesday, October 20, 1992. The Hearing Officer dismissed the appeal for being filed out of time, prompting Azores to file a petition for certiorari alleging grave abuse of discretion [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the SEC gravely abused its discretion in dismissing the appeal for being filed out of time.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the failure to perfect an appeal within the statutory period renders the decision final and unreviewable. Although the deadline fell on a Saturday (October 17), the appeal should have been filed on the next working day, Monday, October 19. Since it was filed on October 20, it was late [3]. Citing *Industrial Timber Corp. v. NLRC*, the Court held that a delay of even one day is fatal absent exceptional circumstances, such as the death of counsel or the prevention of a gross miscarriage of justice, which were not present in this case [3]. Furthermore, the PCA's actions were consistent with its by-laws regarding citizenship and non-payment of dues [4]. The petition was denied for lack of merit [4].
