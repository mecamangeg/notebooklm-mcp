I. CAPTION
REBECCA DESAMITO VDA. DE ALCANTARA, et al. v. COURT OF APPEALS, ANICETO P. CRUZ, AND NORBERTO P. SANTIAGO, G.R. No. 114762, October 7, 1996, 322 Phil. 490, Davide, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
The subject property consists of two lots in Pasay City covered by TCT No. 19232, originally owned in common by Leona C. vda. de Alfonso (1/2) and the predecessors of the petitioners (1/2) [1]. Petitioners claim Leona sold her share to them, evidenced by a "Deed of Extra-Judicial Partition" dated March 13, 1972, and registered on November 16, 1983 [1]. However, this document merely recited a previous sale by Leona to the petitioners, and the actual deed of sale was never presented [1].

On September 7, 1983, Leona executed a *Pacto de Retro* Sale of her 1/2 share to private respondents Cruz and Santiago for P100,000 [2]. Leona failed to redeem the property within the three-month period [2]. Respondents demanded partition, but petitioners refused, claiming ownership of Leona's share and arguing the *pacto de retro* sale was merely an equitable mortgage [2]. The RTC ruled in favor of respondents, declaring the transaction a valid sale and ordering partition. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision but deleted the award of attorney’s fees [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the contract between Leona and respondents is an equitable mortgage.
2. W/N the *Pacto de Retro* sale prevails over the petitioners' claim based on the earlier registered Deed of Extra-Judicial Partition.
3. W/N petitioners are liable to reimburse respondents for income derived from the property.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The contract is a valid sale *con pacto de retro*. The Court found that none of the badges of equitable mortgage under Article 1602 of the Civil Code were present: the price was not inadequate, the vendor did not remain in possession, no extension of the redemption period was granted, and the respondents paid the realty taxes [3].

2. **YES.** The *Pacto de Retro* sale prevails. The Deed of Extra-Judicial Partition was not a valid instrument of conveyance for Leona’s share as it merely mentioned an alleged past sale, and the actual deed of sale was never offered in evidence or registered [4]. Under Section 51 of P.D. 1529, the act of registration operates to convey registered land; thus, registering the partition was an "idle ceremony" regarding the transfer of Leona's share [4]. Furthermore, Article 1544 of the Civil Code on double sales does not apply because petitioners failed to present a valid deed of sale to compete with respondents' title; the article applies only when there are at least two deeds of sale over the same property [4].

3. **NO.** The Court deleted the order for reimbursement of income for lack of legal basis. The obligation to account for income arises only from the date of demand (filing of the complaint), but no evidence was presented regarding the income of the property [5]. This deletion is without prejudice to the application of Article 500 of the Civil Code upon partition [5].

The petition is **DENIED** and the CA decision is **AFFIRMED** with the modification that the award for reimbursement of income is deleted.
