I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DANILO MAGSOMBOL, G.R. No. 98197, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 196, Puno, J.

II. FACTS
On December 25, 1980, at about 4:00 p.m., accused Danilo Magsombol and the victim Geraldo Magsombol engaged in a fistfight in San Luis, Batangas, after Geraldo confronted Danilo about his brother-in-law's recruitment activities [1]. Later that evening at around 9:00 p.m., while Geraldo was walking home after buying cigarettes, Danilo met him and, without warning, stabbed him in the stomach [2]. Geraldo ran but later died from the stab wound [2, 3]. The incident was witnessed by Jojo Magsombol, Leopoldo Magsombol, and Reynaldo Maullion [4].

Danilo surrendered the next day and invoked self-defense, claiming Geraldo attacked him with a knife and he only stabbed Geraldo while wrestling for the weapon [5, 6]. The Regional Trial Court rejected his defense, convicting him of Murder qualified by treachery and evident premeditation, and sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused acted in valid self-defense.
2. W/N the crime committed was Murder attended by treachery and evident premeditation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court found the accused's claim of self-defense to be a complete fabrication [8]. For self-defense to prosper, there must be unlawful aggression, reasonable necessity of means employed, and lack of sufficient provocation [9]. The physical evidence—a vertical superficial abrasion and a stab wound—did not conclusively support the "wrestling" theory, and the accused's minor injuries were likely caused by the earlier fistfight or his flight [10, 11]. Furthermore, the defense presented a perjured witness whose testimony regarding his presence was refuted by documentary evidence [12]. The Court upheld the credibility of the prosecution witnesses, ruling that their relationship to the victim did not disqualify them or taint their testimony [13].

2. **NO.** The crime committed was Homicide, not Murder. The Court held that evident premeditation was not present because there was no proof of the time the accused determined to commit the crime, an act indicating he clung to his determination, or a sufficient lapse of time for reflection [14]. Similarly, treachery was not established because there was no evidence that the accused consciously and deliberately adopted a mode of attack to ensure execution without risk to himself; mere suddenness of an attack does not constitute treachery [14].

**Disposition:** The judgment is **MODIFIED**. Accused is found guilty of **HOMICIDE** with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. He is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) day of *prision mayor* as minimum to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of *reclusion temporal* as maximum [9].
