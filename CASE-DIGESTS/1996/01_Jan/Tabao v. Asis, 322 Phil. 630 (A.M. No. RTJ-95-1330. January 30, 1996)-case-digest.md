I. CAPTION
AZUCENA CINCO TABAO AND JESUSA CINCO ACOSTA v. JUDGE ENRIQUE C. ASIS, A.M. No. RTJ-95-1330, January 30, 1996, 322 Phil. 630, Bellosillo, J.

II. FACTS
Complainants charged Respondent Judge Asis, then MTCC Judge of Tacloban City, with gross irregularity and abuse of authority for notarizing a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) and an Affidavit of Consciousness [1]. These documents authorized Cirila Cinco-Caintic to sell a property in Quezon City belonging to Mariquita M. Cinco-Jocson [2]. Respondent claimed he notarized the documents without a fee as an act of "Christian charity" to aid in the medical expenses of the owner [3]. However, the records revealed that the same documents had already been notarized by a private notary public, Flaviano V. Caintic, over a month prior to Respondent's notarization [3]. The Deputy Court Administrator found that Respondent acted as private counsel to safeguard the interest of the parties and recommended a fine [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Respondent Judge is administratively liable for notarizing a private document (Special Power of Attorney).

IV. RULING
**YES.** Respondent Judge is administratively liable. Under Section 35, Rule 138 of the Revised Rules of Court and Canon 5, Rule 5.07 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, judges are prohibited from engaging in private practice to ensure they give full time to judicial duties and maintain impartiality [5]. Furthermore, the Manual for Clerks of Court provides that municipal judges may only administer oaths on matters related to their official functions and cannot notarize private documents like SPAs [6].

While an exception exists for MTC/MCTC judges to act as notaries public *ex-officio* in far-flung municipalities lacking lawyers or notaries, this exception requires fees to be turned over to the government and a certification of the lack of notaries [7]. This exception did not apply as Tacloban City abounds with notaries public [7]. Respondent’s defense of "Christian charity" was not a valid excuse for acting as a notary public and private counsel [4].

Respondent Judge Enrique C. Asis was **FINED** P10,000.00 and warned that a repetition of the act would warrant a more severe sanction [8].
