I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LYNDON FLORES Y MALARAYAP, G.R. No. 116524, January 18, 1996, 322 Phil. 24, Melo, J. [1]

II. FACTS
On June 20, 1993, in Boac, Marinduque, accused-appellant Lyndon Flores engaged in an altercation with Emperatriz Lazarte regarding a pawned cassette recorder. Flores then turned his attention to Emperatriz’s son, Manuel Lazarte, who was lying on the pavement, dead drunk and unconscious. Flores kicked Manuel two to three times in the stomach and chest while wearing leather "topsider" shoes [1]. Manuel died shortly thereafter due to a ruptured small intestine caused by the strong blows [1]. The trial court convicted Flores, who then appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the killing was attended by treachery.
2. W/N the mitigating circumstance of lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong should be appreciated.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The attack was characterized by treachery. The evidence established that the victim was totally unconscious and dead drunk when Flores administered vicious kicks to his belly [2]. An attack upon an unconscious victim who cannot put up any defense constitutes treachery under Article 14, No. 16 of the Revised Penal Code, as it ensures the execution of the crime without risk to the offender [2]. Thus, the crime committed is Murder, not Homicide.

2. **YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the trial court failed to appreciate the mitigating circumstance of lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong as that committed under Article 13, Par. 3 of the Revised Penal Code [2]. The Court found that Flores had no intent to kill when he attacked the victim, but only intended to inflict injuries [2].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that, considering the mitigating circumstance and the fact that the crime was committed prior to the Death Penalty Law (R.A. 7659), the accused is sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of ten (10) years and one (1) day of *prision mayor*, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months, and one (1) day of *reclusion temporal*, as maximum [2, 3].
