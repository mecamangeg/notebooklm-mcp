I. CAPTION
VICTORINA A. CRUZ v. COURT OF APPEALS; HON. SALVADOR M. ENRIQUEZ, JR., SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT; HON. ARMAND V. FABELLA, SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, CULTURE AND SPORTS; AND NORMA ABRACIA, SCHOOL DIVISION SUPERINTENDENT, G.R. No. 119155, January 30, 1996, 322 Phil. 649, Davide, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Victorina A. Cruz was a Guidance and Counselling Coordinator III at Valenzuela Memorial High School [1]. Following the nationalization of her position under Executive Order No. 189 in 1987, she was placed under the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) and reclassified as a Guidance Counselor R-56, which resulted in a salary reduction [1]. She appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which ruled in her favor and reclassified her position to Guidance Services Specialist II with Salary Grade 16 under R.A. 6758 [1]. However, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) refused to implement the MSPB decision, arguing the Board lacked jurisdiction over position reclassification [2]. Cruz filed a petition for mandamus with the Court of Appeals (CA) to compel enforcement, but the CA denied the petition, ruling that the DBM has sole authority over the compensation and position classification system [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the MSPB has jurisdiction to reclassify the petitioner’s position and order the payment of the corresponding salary.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, holding that the MSPB acted without jurisdiction [3]. The Court ruled that grievances concerning position classification and compensation fall within the primary jurisdiction of the DBM, specifically the Compensation and Position Classification Board (CPCB), under Section 17 of P.D. No. 985, as amended by Section 14 of R.A. No. 6758 [3]. The MSPB's reliance on Section 16(2)(b) of E.O. No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987) regarding "violations of the merit system" was misplaced, as the "demotion" was not a personnel action by an appointing authority but the result of the operation of law (nationalization) [4]. Consequently, the MSPB's decision was unenforceable, and mandamus does not lie to compel its execution. The petition is DISMISSED [4].
