I. CAPTION
FLORENCIO EUGENIO, DOING BUSINESS UNDER THE NAME E & S DELTA VILLAGE v. EXECUTIVE SECRETARY FRANKLIN M. DRILON, HOUSING AND LAND USE REGULATORY BOARD (HLURB) AND PROSPERO PALMIANO, G.R. No. 109404, January 22, 1996, 322 Phil. 112, Panganiban, J. [1]

II. FACTS
On May 10, 1972, private respondent Prospero Palmiano purchased two lots on an installment basis from petitioner Florencio Eugenio [2]. In 1979, the National Housing Authority (NHA) ordered the petitioner to cease and desist from selling lots due to the non-development of the project [2]. Consequently, Palmiano suspended his amortization payments due to the failure to develop [2]. Petitioner subsequently cancelled the contract and resold one of the lots to Spouses Relevo [2]. Palmiano filed a complaint with the Human Settlements Regulatory Commission (HSRC) [2]. While the Office of Appeals, Adjudication and Legal Affairs (OAALA) dismissed the complaint, the HSRC Commission Proper reversed the ruling, applying P.D. 957 to order the petitioner to complete the subdivision and reinstate the contract [3]. The Executive Secretary affirmed the HSRC decision [3]. Petitioner appealed, contending that P.D. 957, enacted in 1976, should not apply retroactively to contracts executed in 1972 [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N P.D. 957 applies retroactively to land purchase agreements entered into prior to its enactment. [4]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that P.D. 957 is to be given retroactive effect to cover contracts executed prior to its enactment in 1976 [4]. Although the decree does not expressly state its retroactivity, the intent is plainly inferred from the law's objective to bridge social justice gaps and protect helpless citizens from "unscrupulous subdivision and condominium sellers" [4]. A strictly prospective application would emasculate the law and allow fraudulent schemes in earlier contracts to continue unchecked [4].

The Court cited Sections 20, 21, and 23 of P.D. 957 as implying retroactivity [5]. Specifically, Section 21 covers "Sales Prior to Decree," mandating developers to fulfill obligations even for lots sold before the law's effectivity [5]. Furthermore, Section 23 allows buyers to desist from payment without forfeiture if the developer fails to complete the project, a provision applicable to the private respondent's case [5].

The petition is DENIED due course and is hereby DISMISSED [5].
