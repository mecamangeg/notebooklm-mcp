I. CAPTION
REBECCA DESAMITO VDA. DE ALCANTARA, et al. v. COURT OF APPEALS, ANICETO P. CRUZ, and NORBERTO P. SANTIAGO, G.R. No. 114762, October 7, 1996, 322 Phil. 490, Davide, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
Leona C. vda. de Alfonso was the registered co-owner of one-half (1/2) of two lots in Pasay City covered by TCT No. 19232; the other half was owned by petitioners (the Alcantaras). On September 7, 1983, Leona sold her share to private respondents Cruz and Santiago via a *Pacto de Retro* Sale for P100,000.00. Leona failed to redeem the property within the three-month period. Subsequently, respondents demanded the partition of the property.

Petitioners refused, arguing that the sale was void because Leona had already transferred her share to them via a "Deed of Extra-Judicial Partition" dated March 13, 1972. They also claimed the transaction with respondents was an equitable mortgage. The 1972 Deed of Extra-Judicial Partition was registered on November 16, 1983, while the *Pacto de Retro* Sale was registered later on October 27, 1987. The Regional Trial Court declared the *Pacto de Retro* sale valid and ordered partition. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision but deleted the award of attorney's fees.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the *Pacto de Retro* Sale is actually an equitable mortgage.
2. W/N the *Pacto de Retro* Sale prevails over the earlier executed Deed of Extra-Judicial Partition.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The contract is a valid sale *con pacto de retro*. The Court found none of the badges of equitable mortgage under Article 1602 of the Civil Code present: the price was not inadequate, the vendor did not remain in possession, no extension of the redemption period was granted, and taxes were paid by the vendees.

2. **YES.** The *Pacto de Retro* Sale prevails. Although the Deed of Extra-Judicial Partition was registered earlier (November 16, 1983) than the *Pacto de Retro* Sale (October 27, 1987), the Partition merely *mentioned* an alleged Deed of Sale executed by Leona in 1972. This 1972 Deed of Sale was never presented in evidence, nor was it registered. Under Section 51 of P.D. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), the act of registration is the operative act to convey or affect the land. The registration of the Deed of Extra-Judicial Partition was an "idle ceremony" ineffective to transfer Leona's share because the actual instrument of conveyance (the 1972 sale) was not registered.

Furthermore, Article 1544 of the Civil Code on double sales does not apply because petitioners failed to present the competing deed of sale. Even if it were applied, respondents successfully presented a valid title and received the owner's duplicate copy from the vendor, while petitioners' claim rested on a document that did not validly convey the specific share in dispute.

The petition is **DENIED**, and the decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED**, with the modification that the order to reimburse income is deleted for lack of basis.
