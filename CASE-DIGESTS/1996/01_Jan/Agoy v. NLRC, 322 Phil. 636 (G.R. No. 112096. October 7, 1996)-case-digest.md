I. CAPTION
MARCELINO B. AGOY v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, EUREKA PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT SERVICES, INC., ET AL., G.R. No. 112096, January 30, 1996, 322 Phil. 636, Francisco, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Marcelino Agoy, a civil engineer, was hired by respondent Eureka Personnel Management Services, Inc. for its principal, Al-Khodari Establishment, as a "CE/Road Engineer" in Saudi Arabia. However, he was deployed as a "Foreman" and eventually assigned as a "Road Foreman" with a lower salary upon arrival. Two months later, he was dismissed and repatriated. Agoy filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. Respondents argued Agoy failed to qualify as a "Road Engineer" during his probationary period and had voluntarily signed a letter of termination and quitclaim.

The POEA dismissed the complaint, upholding the validity of the probationary termination and quitclaim. On appeal, the NLRC reversed the POEA, ruling that the dismissal was illegal as no performance standards were proven. However, acting on a Motion for Reconsideration, the NLRC reversed itself and reinstated the POEA decision, finding that Agoy failed to meet the employer's standards and voluntarily accepted his termination. Agoy filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner was illegally dismissed despite being a probationary employee who signed a waiver.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that Agoy was illegally dismissed.

Under Article 281 of the Labor Code, a probationary employee may be terminated only for just cause or when he fails to qualify as a regular employee in accordance with **reasonable standards made known by the employer to the employee at the time of his engagement** [1]. The burden of proof rests on the employer to show that the dismissal is for just cause [2]. Here, the respondents failed to prove that specific standards were made known to Agoy or that he failed to meet them. The presumption of competence stood, as he was hired based on his credentials [1, 3].

Furthermore, the Court rejected the validity of the quitclaim. Jurisprudence holds that quitclaims, waivers, or releases are looked upon with disfavor, particularly when executed by employees pressured by unscrupulous employers. The fact that Agoy signed the termination notice did not imply voluntariness, as he was in a foreign land and in a disadvantageous position ("adherence, not of choice") [4, 5]. His immediate filing of a complaint upon repatriation negated the claim that he consented freely [2].

The petition was **GRANTED**. The assailed NLRC Resolution was **SET ASIDE**, and the earlier NLRC Decision awarding Agoy his salary for the unexpired portion of the contract was **REINSTATED** [6, 7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. Narvasa, C.J., Davide, Jr., Melo, and Panganiban, JJ., concurred [7].
