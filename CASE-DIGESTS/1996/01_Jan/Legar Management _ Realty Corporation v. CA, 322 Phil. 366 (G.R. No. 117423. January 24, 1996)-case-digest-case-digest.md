I. CAPTION
LEGAR MANAGEMENT & REALTY CORPORATION v. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. JUAN O. ENRIQUEZ, JR., FELIPE PASCUAL, AND DIONISIO ANCHETA, G.R. No. 117423, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 366, Puno, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Spouses Legasto, original owners of an apartment building, entered into a lease with private respondents Pascual and Ancheta. Petitioner Legar Management & Realty Corporation later acquired the rights to the property and continued the lease verbally on a month-to-month basis [2]. In 1992, petitioner sent formal notices terminating the lease and demanding that respondents vacate. When respondents refused, petitioner filed an ejectment case [3]. The Metropolitan Trial Court (MTC) ruled in favor of petitioner, holding that a month-to-month verbal lease has a definite period. However, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) reversed this, ruling that under the Rent Control Law (B.P. Blg. 877), the mere expiration of a month-to-month lease is not a sufficient ground for ejectment. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a verbal lease contract with monthly rental payments can be terminated based solely on the expiration of the month under the Rent Control Law. [4]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that lease agreements with no specified period, but in which rentals are paid monthly, are considered to be on a month-to-month basis under Article 1687 of the Civil Code [4]. Such leases are deemed to be for a definite period and expire after the last day of any given thirty-day period, upon proper demand and notice by the lessor to vacate [4]. Citing *Acab v. Court of Appeals*, the Court explained that Section 6 of B.P. Blg. 877 does not suspend the application of Article 1687 of the Civil Code [5]. Therefore, the termination of the month-to-month lease constitutes sufficient cause for ejectment under Section 5(f) of B.P. Blg. 877 [5].

The petition is **GRANTED**. The decisions of the Court of Appeals and the Regional Trial Court are **REVERSED and SET ASIDE**, and the decision of the Metropolitan Trial Court is **REINSTATED**. [5]
