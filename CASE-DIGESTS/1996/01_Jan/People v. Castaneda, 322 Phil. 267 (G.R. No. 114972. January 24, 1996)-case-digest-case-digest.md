I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FERNANDO CASTANEDA Y SALES, G.R. No. 114972, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 267, Puno, J. [1]

II. FACTS
On the evening of June 12, 1992, private complainant AAA was outside her house when the accused, Fernando Castaneda, approached her, grabbed her hair, and poked a knife at her neck. He forced her inside her house, which was illuminated by three kerosene lamps, and demanded money. AAA gave him P200.00 and was able to see his face through a mirror. Castaneda then dragged her outside and sexually assaulted her at knifepoint [2]. Immediately after the incident, while on her way to the police station with neighbors, AAA spotted Castaneda near a lighted house and identified him, leading to his arrest. Castaneda raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was at a party three kilometers away. The Regional Trial Court convicted him of Robbery with Rape and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt despite his defense of alibi. [4]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, ruling that the victim's identification of the accused was positive and credible [4]. AAA had ample opportunity to observe the accused's features: when he first approached her, inside the well-lit house (via the mirror), and during the sexual assault due to their close proximity [4]. The Court rejected the defense of alibi, reiterating the doctrine that for alibi to prosper, the accused must prove it was physically impossible for him to be at the crime scene. Here, the accused admitted being in the vicinity, and the alleged party was only three kilometers (a 15-minute tricycle ride) away [5]. Furthermore, the non-presentation of the stolen money and knife was not fatal to the prosecution, as the credible testimony of the victim sufficed [5]. The judgment of the trial court is AFFIRMED *in toto* [5].
