I. CAPTION
KELLY R. WICKER AND ATTY. ORLANDO A. RAYOS v. HON. PAUL T. ARCANGEL, AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE RTC, MAKATI, BRANCH 134, G.R. No. 112869, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 476, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Kelly Wicker and his counsel, Atty. Orlando Rayos, filed a motion for inhibition against respondent Judge Arcangel in Civil Case No. 14048 [1, 2]. The motion alleged that the Judge was "personally recruited" by the opposing counsel to replace the previous judge who was "eased out," and expressed doubts about the Judge's partiality and integrity [3, 4]. Finding the allegations "malicious, derogatory and contemptuous," Judge Arcangel ordered them to show cause [5]. Atty. Rayos claimed he was merely "lawyering" in a representative capacity, while Wicker claimed he relied on information from an anonymous court employee [5, 6]. Respondent Judge found them guilty of direct contempt and sentenced them to five (5) days imprisonment and a fine of P100.00 each [7]. Petitioners questioned the order, arguing that the act constituted indirect contempt which requires a hearing, and that the motion was based on justifiable apprehension [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners are liable for direct contempt for filing a motion for inhibition containing derogatory allegations against the judge.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the finding of guilt but modified the penalty. A pleading containing derogatory, offensive, or malicious statements submitted to the court constitutes **direct contempt**, as it is equivalent to "misbehavior committed in the presence of or so near a court or judge as to interrupt the proceedings" under Rule 71, Section 1 of the Rules of Court [9]. Unlike indirect contempt, direct contempt may be adjudged summarily without a formal hearing [10].

The allegations that the Judge was "personally recruited" by opposing counsel were derogatory to his integrity and constituted unwarranted criticism of the administration of justice [11, 12]. Atty. Rayos' defense that he was merely "lawyering" is untenable because a lawyer's duty to the court is not secondary to his duty to the client; Canon 11 of the Code of Professional Responsibility requires lawyers to observe respect due to courts [13].

However, applying the principle that the power to punish for contempt must be exercised on the **preservative and not on the vindictive principle** (*Villavicencio v. Lukban*), the Court found the jail sentence unnecessary [14]. The Court considered Wicker’s advanced age (80) and ill health, and noted that the specific offensive allegations were crafted by Atty. Rayos [15]. Citing *Ceniza v. Sebastian*, the Court ruled that a fine is sufficient to vindicate the dignity of the court [16].

The petition is **DENIED** as to the finding of contempt, but the order is **MODIFIED** by deleting the five-day imprisonment and increasing the fine to P200.00 for each petitioner [17].
