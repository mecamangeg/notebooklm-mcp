I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROGELIO CRISTOBAL, G.R. No. 116279, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 551, Davide, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
On March 31, 1986, AAA, a 28-year-old pregnant married woman, was washing clothes at a creek in the morning. Around midday, Rogelio Cristobal attacked her from behind, punched her stomach, submerged her face in the water, dragged her three meters away, and raped her [1, 2]. AAA immediately reported the incident to her husband and the police, and a medical examination confirmed lacerations and the presence of seminal fluid [3]. Cristobal was arrested years later and raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was plowing a field and having lunch with relatives about three kilometers away during the incident [4, 5]. The Regional Trial Court convicted Cristobal of rape, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* [5]. Cristobal appealed, arguing that AAA’s testimony was inconsistent regarding when her panties were removed and that his alibi should be given weight [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the victim’s credibility is impaired by inconsistencies in her testimony.
2. W/N the defense of alibi prospers.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The inconsistency regarding whether the victim's panties were removed before or after she was laid on the ground is too trivial to affect her credibility [7]. The Supreme Court held that such minor inconsistencies actually enhance credibility as they manifest spontaneity and a lack of scheming [7]. Furthermore, the Court reiterated the doctrine that when a woman says she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show she has been raped, provided her testimony meets the test of credibility [8]. Findings of the trial court on witness credibility are generally not disturbed on appeal [6].

2. **NO.** For the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must establish the physical impossibility of his presence at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission [9]. The Court found that the accused was only three kilometers away from the creek, a manageable distance to travel in a few minutes, thus failing to prove physical impossibility [5, 9].

The appealed decision is **AFFIRMED** with MODIFICATION. The award of moral damages is increased to P40,000.00, and the accused is ordered to pay P25,000.00 as exemplary damages for the perversity of assaulting a pregnant woman [10, 11].
