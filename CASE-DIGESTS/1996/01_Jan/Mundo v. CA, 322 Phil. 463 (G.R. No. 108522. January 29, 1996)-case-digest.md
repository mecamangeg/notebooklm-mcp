I. CAPTION
GERARDO A. DEL MUNDO v. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. TEODORO P. REGINO, DIONISIO PASCUAL, JR., and SPOUSES CARLOS AND ALEJANDRA NAVA, G.R. No. 108522, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 463, Romero, J.

II. FACTS
In 1981, Petitioner Gerardo Del Mundo leased a property in Quezon City from Respondents Spouses Nava with an option to purchase. Del Mundo failed to exercise the option due to lack of funds. He persuaded the Spouses Nava, who were in the United States, to sign a Deed of Sale with Assignment of Mortgage, ostensibly to enable him to secure a loan to pay them. The Spouses Nava signed, but Del Mundo failed to pay the consideration. Consequently, the Spouses Nava executed a revocation of the Deed in 1983 and filed a complaint for Unlawful Detainer against Del Mundo in the Metropolitan Trial Court (MTC).

The MTC ruled in favor of the Spouses Nava. Del Mundo appealed to the Regional Trial Court (RTC), which issued a writ of execution pending appeal. Separately, Del Mundo filed a petition for Declaratory Relief to Quiet Title in the RTC, claiming ownership based on the Deed. The RTC dismissed the declaratory relief petition, declaring the Deed simulated and void. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed this dismissal. Del Mundo filed the instant petition challenging both the CA decision regarding the declaratory relief case and the writ of execution in the ejectment case, arguing the MTC lacked jurisdiction due to the issue of ownership.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Deed of Sale with Assignment of Mortgage is valid.
2. W/N the MTC had jurisdiction over the ejectment case despite the issue of ownership raised by the petitioner.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court affirmed the lower courts' findings that the Deed of Sale was simulated and made without consideration. The Court noted that Del Mundo continued to pay rent after the alleged sale and failed to declare the property in his name, indicating he recognized the Spouses Nava as the true owners. Furthermore, his letters to the respondents showed the documents were signed merely to facilitate a bank loan [1]. The Supreme Court held that findings of fact by the trial court and Court of Appeals are generally binding and conclusive [2].

2. **YES.** The MTC retained jurisdiction. The Supreme Court ruled that the issue of possession can be resolved in an ejectment proceeding without deciding the issue of ownership [3]. A judgment in an unlawful detainer case is conclusive only on the question of possession, not ownership. When the issue of ownership is indispensable to resolving the issue of possession, the MTC is empowered to decide it provisionally, but such decision does not bind the title or affect the ownership of the land [3].

The petition is **DENIED**.
