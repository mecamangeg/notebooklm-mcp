I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RIZALDY CONDE Y CORTEZ, G.R. No. 112034, January 31, 1996, 322 Phil. 757, Davide, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
On October 31, 1990, at around 1:00 A.M., the private complainant, AAA, was sleeping in her home when she felt something hard penetrate her private part. She woke up to find the accused, Rizaldy Conde, on top of her. She shouted, and Conde hurriedly put on his shorts and fled, but was apprehended by AAA's family and neighbors outside. Conde denied the charge, claiming he had been drunk and unconscious, only waking up when he was being mauled by the neighbors. The Regional Trial Court convicted Conde of rape and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*. On appeal, Conde argued that the medical findings showing no extragenital injuries and the lack of resistance negated rape, and questioned the credibility of the prosecution witnesses due to alleged inconsistencies between their affidavits and court testimonies.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused is guilty of rape committed against a sleeping victim.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court ruled that rape was consummated even before the victim awakened, as penetration was accomplished while she was asleep. Under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, rape is committed when the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious, which includes the state of sleep. The Court rejected the defense's reliance on the lack of injuries, citing the medico-legal officer's explanation that the victim's history of childbirth (multiparous) and the accused's lack of resistance when pushed allowed for penetration without new injuries. Furthermore, the Court held that discrepancies between affidavits and testimonies do not impair credibility, as affidavits are often incomplete and inferior to open court testimony. The decision of the lower court was **AFFIRMED**, with the modification that the civil indemnity was increased to P50,000.00.
