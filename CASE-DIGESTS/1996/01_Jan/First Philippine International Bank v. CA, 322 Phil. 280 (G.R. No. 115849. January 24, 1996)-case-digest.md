I. CAPTION
FIRST PHILIPPINE INTERNATIONAL BANK (FORMERLY PRODUCERS BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES) AND MERCURIO RIVERA v. COURT OF APPEALS, CARLOS EJERCITO, IN SUBSTITUTION OF DEMETRIO DEMETRIA, AND JOSE JANOLO, G.R. No. 115849, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 280, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner First Philippine International Bank (formerly Producers Bank) owned six parcels of land (101 hectares) in Sta. Rosa, Laguna. In August 1987, plaintiffs Demetria and Janolo (later substituted by respondent Ejercito) negotiated with petitioner Mercurio Rivera, the Bank’s Manager of the Property Management Department, to purchase the property. On September 1, 1987, Rivera sent a letter counter-offering to sell the property for P5.5 million. On September 17, 1987, Janolo sent a letter proposing a lower price of P4.25 million. On September 28, 1987, the plaintiffs met with Rivera and Luis Co, the Bank’s Senior Vice-President, who confirmed that the P5.5 million price was final. On September 30, 1987, Janolo sent a letter accepting the P5.5 million offer.

However, the Bank, which was under conservatorship, refused to accept payment or execute the deed of sale. In May 1988, the Acting Conservator repudiated Rivera's authority, claiming the transaction was unauthorized. The plaintiffs filed a suit for specific performance. The RTC ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring a perfected contract. While the Bank's appeal was pending in the Court of Appeals (CA), the Bank’s majority stockholders filed a "derivative suit" against the plaintiffs to annul the sale. The CA affirmed the RTC decision with modification on damages.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioners are guilty of forum shopping.
2. W/N there was a perfected contract of sale between the parties.
3. W/N the contract is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds.
4. W/N the Bank Conservator has the authority to revoke the perfected contract.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The filing of the "derivative suit" by the majority stockholders while the main case was pending appeal constitutes forum shopping. There is an identity of interest because the stockholders represented the same entity (the Bank) and sought the same objective—to avoid the sale [1, 2]. The corporate veil cannot be used to shield a violation of the rule against forum shopping [3].

2. **YES.** A contract was perfected. Although Janolo's counter-offer of P4.25 million on September 17 technically extinguished the Bank's original P5.5 million offer, the Bank’s offer was "revived" and reiterated by Rivera and Co during the September 28 meeting [4]. Janolo’s letter on September 30 constituted an absolute acceptance of this revived offer, resulting in a meeting of the minds [4]. Furthermore, Rivera was clothed with **apparent authority** to sell the acquired assets, as he was the Manager of the Property Management Department and was held out by the Bank as the officer in charge of such transactions [5, 6].

3. **NO.** The contract is enforceable. The series of letters between the parties constitutes sufficient memoranda containing the names of the parties, terms, price, and description of the property [7]. Additionally, petitioners failed to object to oral testimony regarding the agreement during trial, which constitutes a ratification of the contract and a waiver of the Statute of Frauds under Article 1405 of the Civil Code [8, 9].

4. **NO.** Section 28-A of Republic Act No. 265 (Central Bank Act) does not give the Conservator the unilateral power to revoke valid, perfected contracts. While the Conservator may revoke actions of previous management, this power extends only to defective (void, voidable, or unenforceable) contracts [10]. Extending this power to valid perfected contracts would violate the non-impairment clause of the Constitution [11].

The petition is **DENIED**. The CA decision is **AFFIRMED**. Petitioner Bank is **REPRIMANDED** for forum shopping.
