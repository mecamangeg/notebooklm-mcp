I. CAPTION
NESCITO C. HILARIO v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, REYNOLDS PHILIPPINES CORPORATION, JAMES G. MILLER, HENRY W. PINKEY, AND GEORGE C. MOLINA, G.R. No. 119583, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 604, Romero, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Nescito C. Hilario was hired by respondent Reynolds Philippines Corporation as a personnel manager in 1984. In November 1985, he was informed of his termination effective January 1, 1986, allegedly due to retrenchment caused by financial losses [1, 2]. Hilario filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. The Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint but awarded unpaid wages. On appeal, the NLRC reversed the Arbiter, ruling the dismissal illegal because Reynolds acted in bad faith by hiring replacements at higher salaries while claiming business reverses [2]. However, the NLRC only awarded backwages from January 1986 until August 1986 (when Hilario found new employment) and separation pay, instead of reinstatement. Hilario appealed to the Supreme Court, seeking reinstatement and full backwages [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioner is entitled to reinstatement.
2. W/N petitioner is entitled to full backwages under Republic Act No. 6715.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Reinstatement is not feasible where the relationship between the employer and employee has been unduly strained, especially for managerial positions which require the employer's full trust and confidence [3]. Since Reynolds consistently refused to reinstate the petitioner, indicative of strained relations, the Court awarded separation pay equivalent to one month's salary for every year of service in lieu of reinstatement [3].

2. **NO.** Petitioner is not entitled to full backwages because the amendment introduced by Republic Act No. 6715, which allows for full backwages, has no retroactive effect [4]. Since the illegal dismissal occurred in 1986—prior to the effectivity of R.A. No. 6715 on March 21, 1989—the applicable jurisprudence is the *Mercury Drug* rule, which limits the award of backwages to three years without qualification or deduction [4].

The petition is GRANTED IN PART. The NLRC decision is MODIFIED; Reynolds is ordered to pay backwages for three years (January 1, 1986, to January 1, 1989), separation pay, unpaid salary, and Christmas bonus [4].
