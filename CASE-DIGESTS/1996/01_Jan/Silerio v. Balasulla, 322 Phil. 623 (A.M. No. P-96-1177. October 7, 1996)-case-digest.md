I. CAPTION
JUDGE SALVADOR D. SILERIO v. IGNACIO B. BALASULLA and JOSE BLANCA, A.M. No. P-96-1177, October 7, 1996, 322 Phil. 623, Bellosillo, J.

II. FACTS
On December 31, 1994, the attendance logbook of the RTC, Branch 8, Legaspi City disappeared [1]. Upon investigation by petitioner Presiding Judge Silerio on January 11, 1995, respondent Process Server Ignacio Balasulla admitted to hiding the logbook [1]. Balasulla initially claimed he acted upon the instruction of respondent Deputy Sheriff Jose Blanca after a lunch with other employees where they conceived the idea [2]. However, Balasulla later executed an affidavit assuming full responsibility to "buy peace," stating the logbook was a source of office trouble for those who were habitually late [3, 4]. The Executive Judge investigated and recommended Balasulla's suspension and the dismissal of charges against Blanca for insufficiency of evidence, which the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) adopted [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N respondent Balasulla is administratively liable for misconduct for concealing the court attendance logbook.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the unauthorized taking and concealing of any court record, paper, or document within the office is prohibited and administratively censurable [7]. The attendance logbook is considered a court record as it contains the record of personnel attendance pursuant to Civil Service Rules [8]. Consequently, Balasulla's act of concealing the logbook without permission constitutes misconduct, violating the mandate that court employees must safeguard the integrity of the court and preserve the correctness of its records [8]. While the OCA recommended a one-month suspension, the Court reduced the penalty to fifteen (15) days, noting Balasulla's prompt admission of guilt which facilitated the logbook's recovery and the fact that this was his first offense [9].

ACCORDINGLY, respondent Ignacio B. Balasulla is SUSPENDED from office for fifteen (15) days without pay, with a warning that a repetition of the same act will be dealt with more severely [10].
