I. CAPTION
PCI AUTOMATION CENTER, INC. v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND HECTOR SANTELICES, G.R. No. 115920, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 536, Puno, J. [1]

II. FACTS
On March 18, 1991, Prime (the contractor) terminated private respondent Hector Santelices, claiming that the project phase he was working on for petitioner PCI Automation Center, Inc. (PCI-AC) had been completed. Santelices filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against both Prime and PCI-AC [2].

The Labor Arbiter ruled the dismissal illegal, finding that the project was not actually finished, and held Prime and PCI-AC solidarily liable. Pending appeal, Prime paid Santelices separation pay. The NLRC affirmed the Labor Arbiter's decision but deleted the award of damages. PCI-AC petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing that Santelices was a project employee whose term had expired and that PCI-AC was merely a client of Prime, not the employer [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N PCI-AC is solidarily liable with Prime for the illegal dismissal of Santelices as a direct employer.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that PCI-AC is solidarily liable because Prime was engaged in "labor-only contracting" under Article 106 of the Labor Code and Sections 8 and 9 of Rule VIII, Book III of the Omnibus Implementing Rules. Labor-only contracting exists when the contractor merely recruits and supplies workers to perform activities directly related to the principal's business without undertaking a specific job or independent business [3].

In this case, the contract showed Prime merely provided manpower (data encoders) to PCI-AC rather than performing a specific outsourced job. Furthermore, PCI-AC managed, supervised, and exercised control over the workers. Consequently, Prime is considered merely an agent, and PCI-AC is treated by law as the direct employer responsible to the employee as if they were directly hired [3].

The petition is **DISMISSED**, and the assailed Decision and Resolution are **AFFIRMED** [4].
