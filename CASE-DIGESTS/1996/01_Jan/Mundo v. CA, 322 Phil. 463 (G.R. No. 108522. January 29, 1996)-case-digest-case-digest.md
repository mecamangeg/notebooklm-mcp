I. CAPTION
GERARDO A. DEL MUNDO v. COURT OF APPEALS, et al., G.R. No. 108522, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 463, Romero, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Gerardo del Mundo leased a property in Quezon City from Spouses Nava with an option to purchase. Unable to pay the purchase price, he persuaded the spouses to sign a Deed of Sale with Assignment of Mortgage to ostensibly help him secure a bank loan. However, no consideration was actually paid [2]. The spouses subsequently revoked the Deed and filed a complaint for unlawful detainer against Petitioner in the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), which ordered him to vacate. Petitioner appealed to the Regional Trial Court (RTC). Separately, he filed a petition for Declaratory Relief to Quiet Title in the RTC, claiming ownership based on the Deed. The RTC dismissed the declaratory relief petition, declaring the Deed void for lack of consideration. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC decision *in toto*. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Deed of Sale with Assignment of Mortgage is valid. [3]
2. W/N the MeTC loses jurisdiction over an ejectment case when the issue of ownership is raised. [3]

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court affirmed that the Deed was simulated and executed without consideration [3]. Petitioner failed to present receipts of payment, provided conflicting accounts regarding the payment, and his conduct—such as paying rent and failing to declare the property in his name—contradicted his claim of ownership. Factual findings of the trial court, when affirmed by the CA, are binding on the Supreme Court [3].

2. **NO.** The issue of possession can be resolved in an ejectment proceeding without deciding the issue of ownership with finality. A judgment in an unlawful detainer case is conclusive only on the question of possession, not ownership [4]. Under Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, Section 33(2), when the issue of ownership is indispensable to the resolution of the issue of possession, the MeTC is empowered to decide it, but the decision does not bind the title of the land [4].

The petition is **DENIED**. Petitioner is reprimanded for employing delaying tactics, and treble costs are imposed [4].
