I. CAPTION
DANIEL MAMOLO, SR. v. JUDGE ROGELIO R. NARISMA, A.M. No. MTJ-96-1072, October 14, 1996, 322 Phil. 670, Bellosillo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Judge Narisma of the MCTC, Bansalan-Magsaysay, Davao del Sur, issued warrants of arrest against Antonio Balagot for murder, a capital offense, recommending no bail [1]. Balagot filed a Petition for Admission to Bail [1]. During the hearing on May 25, 1994, the defense requested bail citing the accused's illness [1]. Respondent Judge granted bail fixed at P150,000.00 [1]. Complainant Mamolo, the victim's father, filed an administrative complaint alleging the Judge granted bail without affording the prosecution the opportunity to prove that the evidence of guilt was strong [1]. The Judge argued that the prosecutor had submitted the resolution to the sound discretion of the court, but a review of the transcript revealed the hearing only addressed the amount of bail, with no questions propounded regarding the strength of the prosecution’s evidence [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge is liable for gross ignorance of the law for granting bail in a capital offense without a hearing on the strength of the evidence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the respondent Judge disregarded basic procedural due process, constituting gross ignorance of the law [2]. In applications for bail involving capital offenses, a hearing is mandatory to determine whether the evidence of guilt is strong [2]. Citing *Borinaga v. Tamin*, the Court ruled that while the determination of the weight of evidence is a matter of judicial discretion, such discretion may only be exercised after evidence is submitted [2]. Even if the prosecution refuses to adduce evidence or submits the matter to the court's discretion, the judge is under a legal obligation to ask questions to ascertain the strength of the state’s evidence [2]. Respondent Judge Rogelio R. Narisma is **FINED** P20,000.00 with a **STERN WARNING** that a repetition of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more severely [3].
