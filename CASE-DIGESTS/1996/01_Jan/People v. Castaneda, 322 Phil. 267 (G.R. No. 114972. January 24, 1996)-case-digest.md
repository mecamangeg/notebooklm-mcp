I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FERNANDO CASTANEDA Y SALES, G.R. No. 114972, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 267, Puno, J.

II. FACTS
On June 12, 1992, at around 10:00 P.M., private complainant AAA was hanging ampalaya leaves outside her home while her children slept. Fernando Castaneda approached her, pulled her hair, and poked a knife at her neck, demanding money. AAA gave him P200.00 from her *aparador* inside the house, which was lit by three kerosene lamps. Castaneda then dragged her outside and raped her at knifepoint. Before leaving, he threatened to kill her if she reported the matter. AAA immediately sought help from neighbors and barangay officials. While walking to the police station around 11:00 P.M., AAA spotted Castaneda passing a lighted house and identified him as the culprit. Castaneda was arrested and charged. He interposed the defense of alibi, claiming he was drinking at a birthday party and was merely passing by when arrested. The RTC convicted him of Robbery with Rape and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the identity of the accused as the perpetrator was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court held that the victim’s identification of the accused was positive and credible. She had ample opportunity to observe his physical features because the moon was bright, the house was illuminated by three kerosene lamps (allowing her to see his face in the *aparador* mirror), and she was in close proximity to him during the sexual act [1-3]. She identified him immediately upon seeing him near the crime scene an hour later and again at the police station [4].

The Court rejected the defense's argument regarding the "suppression of evidence" for the prosecution's failure to present the barangay officials who allegedly heard a different description of the suspect. The Court ruled that the rule on suppression of evidence does not apply when the evidence is available to the defense and is merely corroborative, citing *People v. Lorenzo* [5, 6]. Furthermore, the accused's presence near the crime scene did not negate guilt; the Court noted that criminals may return to the scene to stunt suspicion ("reverse psychology") or, in this case, the accused was too intoxicated to act logically, citing *People v. Ocampo* [6].

The petition was denied, and the judgment of the trial court was AFFIRMED *in toto* [7].
