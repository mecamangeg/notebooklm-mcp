I. CAPTION
JOHANNA SOMBONG v. COURT OF APPEALS AND MARIETTA NERI ALVIAR, LILIBETH NERI AND ALL PERSONS HOLDING THE SUBJECT CHILD ARABELA SOMBONG IN THEIR CUSTODY, G.R. No. 111876, October 14, 1996, 322 Phil. 737, Hermosisima, Jr., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Johanna Sombong claimed that her daughter, Arabella, was being unlawfully withheld by the owners of Sir John Clinic due to unpaid bills and personal disagreements. After a criminal complaint was filed, NBI agents found a child named Cristina Grace Neri in the custody of respondents Marietta Neri Alviar et al. Respondents claimed Cristina was abandoned at the clinic in 1988 and given to them by the clinic's dentist.

Petitioner filed a petition for Habeas Corpus in the RTC of Quezon City. The RTC granted the petition, ordering the delivery of the child to petitioner, ruling that Cristina and Arabella were the same person. The CA reversed the decision, finding that petitioner failed to positively identify the child during confrontation and that petitioner was financially unstable and unfit, whereas respondents provided a stable home. The CA noted petitioner showed no affection toward the child during hearings.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the writ of habeas corpus should be issued to transfer the custody of the minor Cristina to the petitioner.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The grant of the writ depends on the concurrence of three requisites: (1) legal right of custody, (2) unlawful withholding of custody, and (3) the best interest of the minor [1].

First, petitioner failed to establish the identity of the child. In habeas corpus proceedings, identity is relevant. Evidence showed that during NBI confrontation and court hearings, petitioner could not positively identify Cristina as her daughter Arabella and displayed no affection toward the child [2, 3]. Without proof of identity, petitioner has no right of custody [4].

Second, since petitioner has no established right, respondents are not unlawfully withholding the child [5].

Third, the child's welfare is the paramount consideration under Article 8 of the Child and Youth Welfare Code (P.D. 603) and Article 231 of the Family Code [6]. Respondents are financially and physically better positioned to care for the child, while petitioner has no stable job and plans to go abroad [7].

The petition is DENIED and the CA decision is AFFIRMED.
