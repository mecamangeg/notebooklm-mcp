I. CAPTION
MACARIO R. LOPEZ v. HON. NLRC COMMISSIONERS LOURDES C. JAVIER, IRENEO B. BERNARDO, ROGELIO I. RAYALA, LA UNION TRANSPORT COOP. AND/OR ALBERTO F. DY, G.R. No. 102874, January 22, 1996, 322 Phil. 70, Romero, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Macario R. Lopez was appointed as General Manager of private respondent La Union Transport Services Cooperative (LUTRASCO) on probationary status effective December 1, 1989. On April 9, 1990, barely four months later, he was terminated for alleged loss of trust and confidence and unsatisfactory performance, including charges of falsification and neglect of duty [1, 2].

Lopez filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. The Labor Arbiter ruled in his favor, ordering reinstatement, backwages, and damages [3, 4]. On appeal, the NLRC affirmed the finding of illegal dismissal but modified the relief. It set aside the reinstatement order because Lopez was a managerial employee and his reinstatement would not be conducive to industrial harmony. Consequently, the NLRC limited his backwages to three months (reasoning that he was probationary) and deleted the award of damages [5, 6]. Lopez appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing he is entitled to full backwages and damages [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a probationary employee who is illegally dismissed is entitled to full backwages computed from dismissal up to the finality of the decision.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to moral damages and attorney’s fees.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that Article 279 of the Labor Code, as amended by R.A. No. 6715, provides that an employee who is unjustly dismissed shall be entitled to full backwages [8, 9]. The law makes no distinction between probationary and regular employees; thus, probationary employees are entitled to the same relief [10]. Since reinstatement was not feasible due to his managerial position, separation pay was proper. However, the backwages should not be limited to the three-month probationary period. Instead, backwages must be computed from the time compensation was withheld (April 1990) up to the finality of the decision [9]. Notably, the Court applied the then-prevailing rule in *Pines City Educational Center v. NLRC*, ordering the deduction of income earned elsewhere during the period of dismissal (as petitioner worked as an editor-in-chief) to prevent unjust enrichment [11, 12].

2. **NO.** Moral damages are recoverable only where the dismissal was attended by bad faith, fraud, or constituted an act oppressive to labor [12]. The records failed to show that the dismissal was done in bad faith or that petitioner was subjected to unnecessary humiliation. Attorney's fees were also denied as the case did not fall under the exceptions in Art. 2208 of the Civil Code [12].

The decision of the NLRC is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that private respondents are ordered to pay full backwages from April 1990 up to the finality of the decision, subject to the deduction of income earned elsewhere [13].
