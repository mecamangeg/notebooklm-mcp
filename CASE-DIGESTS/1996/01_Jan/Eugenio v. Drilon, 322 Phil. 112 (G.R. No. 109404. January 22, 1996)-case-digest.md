I. CAPTION
FLORENCIO EUGENIO, DOING BUSINESS UNDER THE NAME E & S DELTA VILLAGE v. EXECUTIVE SECRETARY FRANKLIN M. DRILON, HOUSING AND LAND USE REGULATORY BOARD (HLURB) AND PROSPERO PALMIANO, G.R. No. 109404, January 22, 1996, 322 Phil. 112, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
On May 10, 1972, private respondent Prospero Palmiano purchased two lots on installment from petitioner Florencio Eugenio in E & S Delta Village. Due to the petitioner's failure to develop the subdivision—which led the National Housing Authority (NHA) to issue a cease and desist order against further sales—Palmiano suspended his amortization payments. Consequently, petitioner cancelled the contract and resold one of the lots to Spouses Relevo. Palmiano filed a complaint with the Human Settlements Regulatory Commission (HSRC) to annul the sale to the Relevos. The Office of Appeals, Adjudication and Legal Affairs (OAALA) upheld petitioner's cancellation. However, the HSRC Commission Proper reversed the ruling, applying P.D. 957 to order the refund of payments for the resold lot and the reinstatement of the contract for the other. The Office of the President affirmed the HSRC. Petitioner appealed, arguing that P.D. 957, enacted in 1976, cannot retroactively govern contracts executed in 1972.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N P.D. 957 applies retroactively to contracts entered into prior to its enactment.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that P.D. 957 is to be given retroactive effect so as to cover even those contracts executed prior to its enactment in 1976. While the decree does not expressly provide for retroactivity, it is plainly inferred from the legislative intent expressed in the preamble to protect helpless citizens and lot buyers from "unscrupulous subdivision and condominium sellers." The Court ruled that a strictly prospective application would emasculate the law and prevent the State from curbing fraudulent schemes. Furthermore, Section 23 of P.D. 957 explicitly provides that no installment payment shall be forfeited if the buyer desists from payment due to the developer's failure to develop the project. Thus, the non-development justified the private respondent's suspension of payments.

The petition was **DENIED** and the decision of the Executive Secretary was **DISMISSED**.
