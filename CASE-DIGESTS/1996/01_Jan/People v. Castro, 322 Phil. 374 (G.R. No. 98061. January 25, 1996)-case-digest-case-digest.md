I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CASIMIRO DE CASTRO, G.R. No. 98061, January 25, 1996, 322 Phil. 374, Regalado, J. [1]

II. FACTS
On July 20, 1987, at around 2:30 A.M., Macario Aporbo was walking home from a benefit dance in Marihatag, Surigao del Sur [2]. Appellant Casimiro de Castro suddenly appeared and thrust a bolo at Macario [2]. Although Macario parried the initial lunge, appellant’s companion, Antonieto Plaza, pushed Macario to the ground [2]. While Macario was in a supine position, appellant stabbed him in the left chest, causing instantaneous death [2]. Appellant fled and was arrested two years later, while Plaza remained at large [2]. The Regional Trial Court convicted appellant of Murder and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* [2]. Appellant appealed, raising the defense of alibi, claiming he was sleeping in a house only 25 meters away from the crime scene [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi prevails over positive identification.
2. W/N the killing was attended by treachery.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that positive identification by eyewitnesses deserves greater credence than the self-serving defense of alibi [3]. Appellant's alibi was inherently flawed and "per se unbelievable" because the house where he claimed to be sleeping was only 25 meters from the crime scene, making it physically possible for him to sneak out, commit the crime, and return unnoticed [3].

2. **YES.** Treachery was present because the attack was sudden, unexpected, and without provocation on an unarmed victim [3]. Although the victim parried the first thrust, this was merely an instinctive reaction to an unprovoked assault, and the fatal stab occurred while the victim was rendered defenseless on the ground [2, 3].

The judgment of the trial court is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the death indemnity is increased to P50,000.00 and the award for exemplary damages is deleted [4].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Romero, Puno, and Mendoza, JJ., concurred [4].
