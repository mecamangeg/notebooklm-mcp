I. CAPTION
AMERICAN HOME ASSURANCE CO., INC. AND/OR LESLIE J. MOUAT v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (FIRST DIVISION), LABOR ARBITER MANUEL R. CADAY, VIRGILIO MALINAO, ROSEMILO GACUSAN AND DOMINADOR LORIAGA, G.R. No. 111929, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 214, Regalado, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Private respondents Malinao, Gacusan, and Loriaga filed illegal dismissal complaints against petitioners [2]. The Labor Arbiter (LA) ordered them to return money received under a previous settlement before proceedings could continue [2]. Malinao and Gacusan failed to comply, resulting in the dismissal of their cases with prejudice on April 30, 1992 [2]. Loriaga moved to dismiss his own case without prejudice on August 11, 1992 [2]. Respondents' counsel received the April 30 dismissal order on August 10, 1992, but Malinao only filed a "Motion to Admit Motion for Reconsideration" on December 14, 1992, over four months later [3]. The NLRC treated this as an appeal, set aside the LA's order, and directed the LA to hear all claims based on "substantial justice" and Malinao's poverty [3]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in admitting the motion for reconsideration filed beyond the reglementary period. [3]
2. W/N the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in reinstating the complaints of Gacusan and Loriaga. [4]

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The NLRC lacked jurisdiction to entertain the motion [4]. Under Article 223 of the Labor Code, decisions of the Labor Arbiter become final and executory unless appealed within ten (10) calendar days from receipt [4]. It is undisputed that respondents' counsel received the order on August 10, 1992, but filed the motion only on December 14, 1992 [4]. The Court rejected the excuse of "substantial justice" or poverty, holding that the perfection of an appeal within the statutory period is jurisdictional and that a client is bound by the gross negligence of their counsel [4].

2. **YES.** The reinstatement of Gacusan and Loriaga's complaints was baseless and irregular [5]. Gacusan never filed a motion for reconsideration or appeal, making the dismissal final as to him, and he had executed a valid quitclaim [5]. Regarding Loriaga, he voluntarily moved for the dismissal of his own case, making it absurd for the NLRC to reinstate a case the complainant himself sought to dismiss [5].

The petition is GRANTED, the NLRC Resolution is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the Order of the Labor Arbiter dated April 30, 1992, is REINSTATED [5].
