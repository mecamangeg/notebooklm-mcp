I. CAPTION
BELINDA TAREDO, FOR HERSELF AND IN REPRESENTATION OF HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS, AND TEOFILA CORPUZ TANEDO, REPRESENTING HER MINOR DAUGHTER VERNA TANEDO v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, SPOUSES RICARDO M. TAREDO AND TERESITA BARERA TAREDO, G.R. No. 104482, January 27, 1997, 322 Phil. 84, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Lazaro Tañedo executed a notarized deed of sale in 1962 favoring his brother Ricardo and the latter's wife Teresita (private respondents) covering his "future inheritance" [1, 2]. Upon his father's death, Lazaro executed an "Affidavit of Conformity" in 1980 to validate the 1962 sale [2]. On December 29, 1980, Lazaro executed a second deed of sale conveying the same property to his children (petitioners) [2]. Subsequently, on January 13, 1981, Lazaro executed a third deed of sale favoring private respondents covering his undivided share in the property [2]. Private respondents registered this last deed on June 7, 1982 [2]. Petitioners filed a complaint for rescission, claiming ownership based on the December 1980 sale [2]. The RTC ruled in favor of private respondents, and the CA affirmed, holding that the 1981 sale was valid and its registration in good faith vested title in respondents [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 1962 sale of future inheritance is valid.
2. W/N the private respondents are the rightful owners of the property.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the 1962 contract is void. Under Article 1347 of the Civil Code, no contract may be entered into upon a future inheritance except in cases expressly authorized by law [3, 4]. Consequently, the void contract cannot be the source of any right or obligation, and the "Affidavit of Conformity" executed in 1980 could not validate or ratify it [3].

2. **YES.** The Court applied the rules on double sale of immovable property (Article 1544 of the Civil Code). Although the deed of sale in favor of private respondents (January 13, 1981) was executed later than the one in favor of petitioners (December 29, 1980), ownership vested in the respondents because they registered the sale in the Registry of Property in good faith [4]. Ownership of immovable property belongs to the buyer who in good faith registers it first [4]. Petitioners, despite being in possession, failed to register their sale [4]. The Court affirmed the lower courts' factual finding that private respondents acted in good faith [4].

The petition is DENIED and the decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED [5].
