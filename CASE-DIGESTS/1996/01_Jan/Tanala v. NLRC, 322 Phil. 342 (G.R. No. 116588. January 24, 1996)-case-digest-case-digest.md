I. CAPTION
PRIMO T. TANALA v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, DIANA S. OCHOA AND/OR VIA MARE CATERING SERVICES, G.R. No. 116588, January 24, 1996, 322 Phil. 342, Regalado, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tanala, a service driver for Via Mare for 15 years, engaged in a fight with a co-employee near company premises after work hours [1]. A security guard reported that Tanala took a knife from his bag inside the company garage prior to the altercation [1]. Consequently, the company placed him under 30-day preventive suspension and subsequently refused to readmit him, effectively dismissing him for possessing a deadly weapon [1]. Tanala filed for illegal dismissal. The Labor Arbiter ruled in his favor, finding no knife was involved based on affidavits [2]. On appeal, the NLRC reversed the decision, giving credence to the security guard's report [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal was for a valid cause.
2. W/N the petitioner was denied procedural due process.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the NLRC's finding that the dismissal was for a valid cause, giving weight to the positive testimony of the security guard who had no ill motive [3]. However, citing *Soco v. Mercantile Corporation of Davao* and the principle of social and compassionate justice, the Court ruled that Tanala is entitled to separation pay (one month's salary for every year of service) because the incident occurred outside company premises after office hours and was his first infraction in 15 years [3].

2. **YES.** The petitioner was denied procedural due process as he was not furnished the required two written notices: a notice of the particular acts charged and a notice of the decision to dismiss [4]. The notice of preventive suspension was insufficient [4]. Thus, the company was ordered to pay P1,000.00 as indemnity [4].

The judgment of the NLRC is **AFFIRMED** with **MODIFICATION** awarding separation pay and indemnity [4].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Romero, Puno, and Mendoza, JJ., concurred [5].
