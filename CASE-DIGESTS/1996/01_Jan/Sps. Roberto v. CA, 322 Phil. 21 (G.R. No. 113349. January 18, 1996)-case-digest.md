I. CAPTION
SPOUSES ROBERTO AND LILIA MONDONEDO v. COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. No. 113349, January 18, 1996, 322 Phil. 21, Panganiban, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Sps. Mondonedo were plaintiffs in a civil case before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati [1]. The RTC declared them non-suited and dismissed their complaint due to their counsel's late appearance at the pre-trial hearing [1]. Counsel claimed the delay was caused by flooded streets due to a typhoon, a reason disputed by the private respondent, Security Bank [1]. Instead of appealing the dismissal, petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA) [1]. The CA dismissed the petition, ruling that the proper remedy was appeal, not certiorari, and noting that petitioners failed to state the date of receipt of the lower court's denial of their motion for reconsideration [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the remedy of a plaintiff declared non-suited for failure to appear at the pre-trial hearing is certiorari.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The proper remedy is appeal. A dismissal for failure to appear at the pre-trial hearing is deemed an adjudication on the merits unless otherwise stated in the order, pursuant to Section 3, Rule 17 and Section 2, Rule 20 of the Rules of Court [3]. Citing *Geralde vs. Sabido*, the Court held that since the dismissal is a final resolution of the case, the plaintiff's remedy is to appeal from the order of dismissal [3, 4]. Where appeal is the proper remedy, certiorari will not lie [4].

The petition is DENIED [5].
