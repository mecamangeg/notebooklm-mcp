I. CAPTION
GEORGE ANDERSON v. THE LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, PACIFIC BUSINESS VENTURES INC. AND KAMAL AL BITAR, G.R. No. 111212, January 22, 1996, 322 Phil. 122, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner George Anderson was recruited by respondent Pacific Business Ventures, Inc. to work as a foreman in Saudi Arabia for a two-year contract starting February 1988 [1]. After nine months, respondent Kamal Al Bitar terminated his services for alleged "loss of confidence," specifically citing lack of leadership and motivation [1, 2]. Anderson filed a complaint for illegal dismissal with the POEA, which ruled in his favor, ordering respondents to pay his salaries for the unexpired portion of the contract [3, 4].

Respondents appealed to the NLRC. In a second supplemental appeal memorandum, they submitted for the first time an affidavit by Kamal Al Bitar alleging Anderson's "miserable performance" and "negative attitude" [5, 6]. This affidavit was served directly on Anderson, not his counsel [7]. The NLRC reversed the POEA decision and dismissed the complaint, ruling that Anderson failed to refute the allegations in the affidavit [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner was illegally dismissed based on the ground of loss of confidence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal was illegal because the "loss of confidence" was not supported by substantial evidence.

While loss of confidence is a just cause for termination, it must be based on a valid reason. The Court found that the affidavit of Kamal Al Bitar contained nothing but "general, vague and amorphous allegations" of unfitness without citing specific acts or omissions [9, 10]. Furthermore, the NLRC erred in admitting and relying on this affidavit because: (1) it was submitted belatedly on appeal without explanation for the delay [7]; and (2) it was served on the petitioner directly rather than his counsel, violating Rule III, § 3 and Rule II, § 4 of the NLRC Rules of Procedure [7, 11]. The Court emphasized that when a party is represented by counsel, service must be made on such counsel to be valid, and respondents could not profit from their disregard of the rules [12].

Since the dismissal was without just cause and involved a fixed-term contract, Anderson is entitled to salaries for the unexpired portion of his contract (15 months) [13].

**Disposition:** The decision of the NLRC is SET ASIDE and that of the POEA Administrator is REINSTATED with the MODIFICATION that petitioner should be paid an additional US$205.00 representing the difference in termination pay based on his actual salary [14].
