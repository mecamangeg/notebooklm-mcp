I. CAPTION
REMEDIOS K. ASIS v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, VETERANS PHILIPPINES SCOUT SECURITY AGENCY AND/OR ENGR. SERGIO JAMILA IV, G.R. No. 107378, September 30, 1996, 322 Phil. 418, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Asis was employed by respondent Veterans Philippines Scout Security Agency as a security guard and designated as Detachment Commander at Purefoods Corporation in Sta. Rosa, Laguna [1]. On July 16, 1990, upon returning from an approved leave of absence, he discovered he had been replaced and was informed of his transfer to Calauan, Laguna as an ordinary security guard [1]. Asis refused the new assignment and filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, arguing the transfer constituted a demotion and constructive dismissal [1]. The Labor Arbiter ruled in favor of Asis, finding the transfer amounted to a demotion without valid reason [2]. However, the NLRC reversed this decision, holding that the transfer was a valid exercise of management prerogative [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner was constructively dismissed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while management has the prerogative to transfer employees, this power cannot be exercised if it results in a demotion in rank or a diminution in salary, benefits, and privileges [2]. The Court found the transfer unjustified for two reasons: (1) **Demotion in Rank:** Transferring Asis from Detachment Commander to a mere security guard removed his supervisory powers [3]; and (2) **Diminution in Pay:** The transfer to a distant post in Calauan, Laguna, entailed higher transportation costs, resulting in a practical diminution of his take-home pay despite his nominal salary remaining the same [3]. Consequently, the petition was **GRANTED**, the NLRC decision was **SET ASIDE**, and the case was remanded for the computation of backwages and separation pay pursuant to Art. 279 of the Labor Code [4].
