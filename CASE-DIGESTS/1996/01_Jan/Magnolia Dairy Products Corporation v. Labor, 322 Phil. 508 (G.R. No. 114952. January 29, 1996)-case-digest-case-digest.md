I. CAPTION
MAGNOLIA DAIRY PRODUCTS CORPORATION v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND JENNY A. CALIBO, G.R. No. 114952, January 29, 1996, 322 Phil. 508, Francisco, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Magnolia Dairy Products Corporation entered into service contracts with manpower agencies Skillpower, Inc. and Lippercon Services, Inc. Private respondent Jenny A. CALIBO was assigned by these agencies to Magnolia’s Tetra Paster Division to perform tasks such as cleaning contaminated premises and repasting cartons. In December 1987, Calibo was terminated due to the installation of automated machines. She filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. Magnolia argued that no employer-employee relationship existed and that the dismissal was for an authorized cause. The NLRC ruled in favor of Calibo, awarding reinstatement and backwages [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N an employer-employee relationship existed between Magnolia and Calibo.
2. W/N Calibo was illegally dismissed entitling her to reinstatement and backwages.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** An employer-employee relationship existed because Skillpower, Inc. and Lippercon Services, Inc. were engaged in "labor-only" contracting. The services performed by Calibo were directly related, necessary, and desirable to Magnolia’s business. Additionally, the workers used Magnolia's premises and tools, and Magnolia exercised the power to discipline them, such as imposing suspensions. Under the Labor Code, when "labor-only" contracting exists, the principal is responsible to the employee as if they were directly employed [4].

2. **NO.** The dismissal was not illegal as it was based on a valid authorized cause under Article 283 of the Labor Code, specifically the installation of labor-saving devices, which is a management prerogative [5]. However, Magnolia failed to comply with the statutory requirement of serving written notice to the employee and the DOLE at least one month prior to termination. Citing the *Wenphil* doctrine, the Court held that failure to provide notice does not make the dismissal void if it is for a just or authorized cause; it only makes the dismissal defective [5]. Consequently, reinstatement and backwages are improper remedies. Instead, the employee is entitled to separation pay and indemnity for the violation of due process [5].

The decision appealed from is MODIFIED. The award of reinstatement and backwages is SET ASIDE. Petitioner is ordered to pay separation pay equivalent to one (1) month pay for every year of service and P5,000.00 as indemnification for failure to serve the required notice [3].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Narvasa, C.J., Davide, Jr., Melo, and Panganiban, JJ., concurred [3].
