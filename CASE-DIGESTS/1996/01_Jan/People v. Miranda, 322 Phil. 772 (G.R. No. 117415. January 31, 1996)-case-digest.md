I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ELISA MIRANDA Y DORIA, G.R. No. 117415, January 31, 1996, 322 Phil. 772, Bellosillo, J.

II. FACTS
Atty. Tomas P. Evangelista, counsel *de parte* for accused-appellant Elisa Miranda, failed to file the appellant’s brief within the prescribed period which expired on May 27, 1995 [1]. The Supreme Court initially dismissed the appeal due to this inaction but later reinstated it to give the accused another opportunity [2]. When directed to explain the failure, Atty. Evangelista stated that he assumed he had been relieved as counsel because the accused's father never returned to confer with him or furnish the transcript of stenographic notes needed to prepare the brief [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Atty. Evangelista’s explanation for failing to file the appellant's brief is acceptable.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court found the explanation unacceptable [2]. Atty. Evangelista knew the deadline was May 27, 1995, and he could have easily sought an extension by citing his difficulties with the client [2]. The Court held that merely assuming he had been substituted demonstrated indifference to his professional responsibilities and a lack of concern for the interest of his client, who faced the risk of long-term confinement [2].

Accordingly, the Court imposed a fine of P500.00 on Atty. Tomas P. Evangelista, payable within five days from notice, and warned him that a repetition of the same or similar act would be dealt with more severely [3].
