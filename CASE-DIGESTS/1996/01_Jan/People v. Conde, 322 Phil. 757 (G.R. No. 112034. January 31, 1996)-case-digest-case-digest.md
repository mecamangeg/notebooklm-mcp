I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RIZALDY CONDE Y CORTEZ, G.R. No. 112034, January 31, 1996, 322 Phil. 757, Davide, Jr., J. [1]

II. FACTS
On October 31, 1990, AAA, a 38-year-old housewife, was sleeping in her home when she felt something hard penetrate her private organ. She woke up to find the accused, Rizaldy Conde, on top of her. Conde fled but was apprehended by neighbors immediately. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) convicted Conde of rape and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*. Conde appealed, arguing that rape was improbable because the victim was asleep during the alleged act and suffered no extragenital physical injuries. [2]

III. ISSUE/S
W/N rape is committed when the victim is asleep at the time of penetration. [3]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that rape was consummated even though the victim was asleep during the penetration. Under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman who is "deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious." The Court ruled that sleep is a natural suspension of consciousness, and carnal knowledge of a woman while she is asleep constitutes rape, citing established jurisprudence in *People v. Dayo* and *People v. Caballero* [3]. The lack of genital injury was attributed to the victim's previous childbirths and did not negate the commission of the crime [3].

The appeal is **DISMISSED** and the decision of the RTC is **AFFIRMED**, with the modification that the civil indemnity awarded to the victim is increased to P50,000.00 [4].
