I. CAPTION
FRANCEL REALTY CORPORATION v. COURT OF APPEALS and FRANCISCO T. SYCIP, G.R. No. 117051, September 23, 1996, 322 Phil. 138, Mendoza, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Francel Realty Corporation filed a complaint for unlawful detainer against respondent Francisco T. Sycip in the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Bacoor, Cavite [1]. Petitioner alleged that Sycip failed to pay monthly amortizations for a townhouse unit under a Contract to Sell [1]. Sycip admitted stopping payments but averred it was due to defective construction, citing a pending complaint he filed against petitioner with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) for "unsound real estate business practice" [1]. The MTC dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that the case was cognizable by the HLURB, but awarded Sycip damages and attorney's fees on his counterclaim [2]. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) affirmed the decision, and the Court of Appeals dismissed petitioner's appeal [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the MTC has jurisdiction over the complaint for unlawful detainer involving a subdivision lot buyer.
2. W/N the MTC can award damages on a counterclaim after dismissing the main complaint for lack of jurisdiction.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The case is not a simple unlawful detainer action but one involving the collection of amortization payments for a subdivision lot [3]. Under P.D. Nos. 957 and 1344, such cases fall within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the HLURB to regulate the real estate trade and decide cases of unsound real estate business practices [3]. The Court held that the issue of the buyer's rights and duties is inextricably linked to the developer's warranties, which is a matter for the HLURB to resolve [3].

2. **NO.** A party may file a counterclaim only if the court has jurisdiction to entertain the claim; otherwise, the counterclaim cannot be filed (Rule 6, Sec. 8, Rules of Court) [4]. Since the MTC correctly ruled it had no jurisdiction over the petitioner's complaint, it also lacked jurisdiction to grant the respondent's counterclaim for damages [4]. Furthermore, there was no proof of bad faith by the petitioner to warrant moral or exemplary damages [4].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **REVERSED**, and the complaint and counterclaim are **DISMISSED** [5].
