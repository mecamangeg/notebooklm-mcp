I. CAPTION
SATURNINO MOLDERO v. RENEE J. YANDOC for herself and as Guardian of the properties of the Minors, KARINA, CORAZON, MERCEDES, FRANCISCO and BEATRIZ, all surnamed YANDOC y JURADO, G.R. No. L-14321, October 20, 1961, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
Saturnino Moldero obtained a judgment for a sum of money against Arsenio Yandoc. A parcel of unregistered land belonging to Arsenio was levied upon and sold at a public auction on June 27, 1953, with Moldero as the highest bidder [1]. While the execution sale was finalized in August 1954, Arsenio applied for the original registration of the land under Act No. 496. Moldero failed to file any claim in the registration proceedings. Consequently, Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 0-3 was issued to Arsenio "free from all liens and encumbrances" on December 2, 1954 [2]. Subsequently, the land was transferred to Renee Yandoc and her minor children via a deed of exchange, resulting in the cancellation of OCT No. 0-3 and the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-41 in their names [2]. Moldero later attempted to have his certificate of sale annotated on the title, but the Register of Deeds refused [3]. Moldero then filed an action for reconveyance and cancellation of TCT No. T-41 against Renee and the minors. The trial court dismissed the complaint for lack of cause of action [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for reconveyance can prosper against the subsequent transferees (Renee Yandoc, et al.) despite the plaintiff's failure to annotate his claim on the original title.

IV. RULING
**NO.** Under the Torrens system, claims and liens of whatever character existing against the land prior to the issuance of the certificate of title are cut off if not noted thereon [5]. The certificate binds the whole world, and Section 38 of Act No. 496 (Land Registration Law) provides that every decree of registration shall quiet title to the land, subject only to exceptions in the law [6]. Since Moldero failed to file his claim during the registration proceedings, the OCT was validly issued free of his lien. Furthermore, while an action for reconveyance is a remedy for wrongful registration, it can only be maintained against the person in whose name the land was originally registered, not against subsequent transferees who are innocent third parties [7]. Renee Yandoc and the minors are subsequent transferees presumed to be innocent purchasers for value [8]. Moldero's remedy would have been damages against the original registrant, not reconveyance against innocent third parties.

The Order appealed from is affirmed [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, and Paredes concurred; Justices Bautista Angelo, Barrera, and Dizon took no part) [9].
