I. CAPTION
REXWELL CORPORATION v. DOMINADOR P. CANLAS, G.R. No. L-16746, December 30, 1961, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
On October 28, 1959, Rexwell Corporation filed a complaint against Dominador Canlas to collect the unpaid balance of P5,014.74 for a well-drilling contract. Canlas admitted hiring Rexwell but alleged the work was defective.

Rexwell moved to postpone the hearing scheduled for December 1959, requesting it be reset to February 1960. The ground was that its principal witnesses—the corporation's President and Manager—had left for the United States on November 28, 1959, and would not return until late January. The trial court denied the motion. When the case was called on December 18, 1959, Rexwell again moved for resetting, which was denied. The court then issued an order dismissing the case for plaintiff's failure to present evidence. Rexwell appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for postponement and dismissing the complaint.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while applications for continuance are addressed to the sound discretion of the court under Section 2, Rule 115 of the Rules of Court, the exercise of that discretion must be judicial and not arbitrary.

Citing *People v. Romero* and *Ching Heng So v. Tan Boon Kong*, the Court ruled that it is an abuse of discretion to deny a reasonable opportunity for preparation to a party who, without malice, fault, or inexcusable negligence, is not prepared for trial. In this case, there was no manifest intent to delay; the case had been pending for only one month, and the motion was filed well in advance. Furthermore, the defendant would not have been prejudiced, as he had also manifested a desire to set the hearing in 1960. The dismissal was deemed hasty and clearly erroneous.

The orders of dismissal and denial of postponement are **SET ASIDE**, and the case is remanded to the lower court for trial.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**J.B.L. Reyes, J.** reserved his vote, noting that he saw no reason why the depositions of the witnesses were not taken before they left the Philippines.
