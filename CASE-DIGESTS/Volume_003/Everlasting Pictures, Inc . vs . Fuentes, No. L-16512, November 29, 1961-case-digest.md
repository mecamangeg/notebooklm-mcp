**I. CAPTION**
**EVERLASTING PICTURES, INC., ET AL. v. F. A. FUENTES, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-16512, November 29, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
On October 24, 1958, a complaint for unpaid wages was filed against Everlasting Pictures, Inc. before Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor. After the corporation failed to appear, the hearing officer rendered a decision ordering them to pay the complainants. The Regional Administrator subsequently issued a writ of execution, and the sheriff sold some of the corporation's properties. Everlasting Pictures filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to enjoin further enforcement, arguing that under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, the hearing officer and Regional Administrator lacked valid authority to take cognizance of the claim or issue a writ of execution. The CFI ruled that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A was unconstitutional. The respondents appealed directly to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Plan was lawfully approved by Congress and did not unduly delegate power.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N Reorganization Plan No. 20-A validly granted the Department of Labor entities the power to adjudicate claims and issue writs of execution.
2. W/N Reorganization Plan No. 20-A became a valid law through legislative inaction.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Government Survey and Reorganization Commission was not authorized to create courts of justice or transfer jurisdiction from the courts to officials appointed under the Reorganization Plan. Republic Act No. 997 limited the Commission's powers to the reorganization of the Executive Branch and did not grant authority to transfer powers vested in the courts of justice. The Legislature cannot delegate its power to create courts to an executive agency. Furthermore, the power to issue a writ of execution is essentially a judicial function vested in courts of record; bestowing this power upon the Commission or Regional Offices would diminish the jurisdiction of the courts [1-3].

2. **NO.** The procedure of enactment by legislative inaction—where the Plan would become law because Congress adjourned without disapproving it—is unconstitutional. The Constitution requires positive and separate action by each House of Congress to enact laws. Allowing a measure to become law merely through silence or adjournment violates democratic processes and the tri-departmental scheme of government [4, 5].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision appealed from is affirmed.
