I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ERNESTO S. GAMBOA, G.R. No. L-16504, October 27, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On March 20, 1953, Ernesto Gamboa filed his 1952 income tax return reporting a net loss. On January 29, 1956, the Republic (through the Bureau of Internal Revenue) discovered that Gamboa had sold several parcels of land in 1952 for P110,000 (originally bought for P42,000), resulting in an unreported profit. On May 13, 1957, the Republic issued an assessment notice demanding P29,133 in deficiency income tax [1].

Gamboa did not contest or appeal this assessment to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) within the 30-day period prescribed by Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125 [2]. When Gamboa refused to pay, the Republic filed an ordinary action for the recovery of the sum of money in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental on February 17, 1958. The CFI ruled in favor of the Republic. Gamboa appealed, arguing that: (1) the right to collect had prescribed under the 3-year limitation in Section 51(d) of the Tax Code; (2) the CFI lacked jurisdiction as the case belonged to the CTA; and (3) the assessment was incorrect [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the government's right to sue for unpaid taxes is barred by the three-year limitation period in Section 51(d) of the Tax Code.
2. W/N the Court of First Instance (CFI) has jurisdiction over the action to collect the tax.
3. W/N Gamboa can still contest the accuracy of the tax assessment in the judicial action for collection.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The three-year limitation in Section 51(d) of the Tax Code applies only to the right of the government to enforce collection by **summary statutory proceedings** (distraint and levy), not by judicial action [3, 4]. The proper prescriptive periods for judicial action are found in Sections 331 and 332 of the Tax Code [5]. Since Gamboa filed a false return, Section 332(a) applies, allowing a proceeding in court within ten (10) years after the discovery of the falsity. The falsity was discovered on January 29, 1956, and the complaint was filed on February 17, 1958, well within the ten-year period [6, 7].

2. **YES.** The CFI has jurisdiction. Gamboa failed to dispute the assessment before the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) in accordance with Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125. Consequently, the assessment became **uncontested**. The complaint filed by the Republic merely became an ordinary action for the recovery of a sum of money, which is cognizable by the regular courts (CFI) and is beyond the jurisdiction of the CTA [8].

3. **NO.** Gamboa can no longer question the accuracy of the assessment. To contest the assessment, he should have availed of the remedy provided in Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125 (appeal to the CTA within 30 days). Having failed to do so, the assessment became final and executory, and it is too late to assail it in the ordinary collection suit [9].

**Decision affirmed.**
