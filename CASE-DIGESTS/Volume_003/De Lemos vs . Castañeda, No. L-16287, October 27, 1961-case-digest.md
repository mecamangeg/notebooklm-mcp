**I. CAPTION**
JULIAN DE LEMOS v. MANUEL E. CASTAÑEDA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16287, October 27, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Julian de Lemos claimed to be a *bona fide* occupant since 1938 of a lot within the Nuestra Señora de Guia Estate in Tondo. The estate was originally private land acquired by the government under Commonwealth Act No. 539 for subdivision and resale to occupants. A dispute arose regarding a 12-square-meter portion which was included in the lot of Hermogenes Pagsisihan. The Land Tenure Administration (LTA) ruled against De Lemos and subsequently sold the lot to Pagsisihan. De Lemos filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI dismissed the complaint on the ground of failure to exhaust administrative remedies, noting that De Lemos failed to appeal the LTA's orders to the Office of the President. De Lemos appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies applies to disputes over lands originally owned by private parties and acquired by the government for resale.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the rule requiring previous exhaustion of administrative remedies before resorting to the courts does not apply to disputes over lands that were originally owned by private parties and later acquired by the Government for the purpose of reselling them to *bona fide* tenants or occupants [1]. The Court distinguished this from controversies involving disposable public lands. Citing *Marukot v. Jacinto*, *Santiago v. Cruz*, and *Geukeko v. Araneta*, the Court reiterated that the condition precedent of exhausting administrative remedies is confined to public lands and does not extend to private lands purchased by the Government [2, 3].

The appealed order of dismissal is **REVERSED**, and the records are ordered **REMANDED** to the court of origin for further proceedings [3].
