I. CAPTION
CATALINA R. REYES v. HON. BIENVENIDO A. TAN and FRANCISCA R. JUSTINIANI, G.R. No. L-16982, September 30, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Francisca R. Justiniani, a minority stockholder of Roxas-Kalaw Textile Mills, Inc., filed a derivative suit against the corporation's directors. She alleged that the directors allowed the fraudulent importation of finished textiles instead of raw materials worth over $289,000, violating Central Bank regulations [1, 2]. This breach led the Central Bank to stop dollar allocations, paralyzing the textile mill's operations [2]. Despite the minority's urging, the directors refused to sue the erring parties or remedy the situation for two years [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila (Judge Tan) appointed a receiver to protect the corporation and attempt to restore the dollar allocations [4, 5]. Petitioner Catalina R. Reyes challenged this order via certiorari, arguing there was no emergency and the stockholder failed to exhaust intra-corporate remedies timely [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appointment of a receiver was proper in a derivative suit filed by a minority stockholder against directors guilty of breach of trust.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that where corporate directors are guilty of a breach of trust—not merely an error of judgment or abuse of discretion—and intra-corporate remedies are futile, a stockholder may institute a suit on behalf of the corporation to redress the wrong [7, 8]. The Court relied on the doctrine in *Angeles v. Santos* (64 Phil. 697). In this case, the directors permitted fraudulent transactions to go unpunished and did nothing to remove the erring managers [9]. The appointment of a receiver was found necessary to restore the confidence of the Central Bank and potentially revive the dollar allocations essential for the business [5]. The stockholder's inaction for two years did not bar the suit, as she had the right to assume during that period that the directors would remedy the anomalies they created [10, 11].

Petition dismissed [12].
