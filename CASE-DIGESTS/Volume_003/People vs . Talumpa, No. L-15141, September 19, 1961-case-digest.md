**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. IBRAHIM TALUMPA, ABDULA TALUMPA, PALOT MAULANA and SARO GANDARIBO, G.R. No. L-15141, September 19, 1961, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
On June 7, 1957, while Chao Seng Yee, a bill collector, was waiting for a bus in Labangan, Zamboanga del Sur, he was shot several times by Saro Gandaribo. As the victim fell, appellant Abdula Talumpa snatched a paper bag the victim was holding, which contained money collected for his employer, Hui Eng. The assailants fled. Palot Maulana, a co-accused turned state witness, and Bonifacio Labora, an eyewitness, identified Saro and Abdula. Abdula interposed the defense of alibi, claiming he was farming and later went to Cotabato to visit his sick father. He also argued that Labora testified against him out of spite due to a previous altercation and suspicion regarding stolen carabaos. The Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Sur convicted Saro and Abdula of robbery with homicide. Abdula appealed, questioning the credibility of witnesses and the amount determined to be stolen.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the prosecution witnesses were credible despite the appellant's defense of alibi and alleged witness bias.
2. W/N the lower court erred in fixing the amount of money stolen.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court found the witnesses deserving of credence. The appellant's claim that the witness Labora held a grudge (due to appellant's desire to slap him or suspicion of theft) involved subjective factors Labora had no means of knowing and were insufficient to induce a false imputation of a crime as serious as robbery with homicide [1]. Furthermore, the appellant’s trip to Cotabato immediately after the crime, for an alleged illness of his father that was not proven, bore "all the earmarks of a flight" [2]. The Court also noted the implausibility of his alibi, as it would not take nine days to plow one hectare of land [3].

2. **YES.** The evidence established that the victim had collected a total of P3,283 from customers. Upon the recovery of his body, only P1,927.25 was found. Since there was no evidence that the victim disposed of any funds, the Court correctly concluded that the missing P1,355.75 was contained in the bag snatched by the appellant [4].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [5].
