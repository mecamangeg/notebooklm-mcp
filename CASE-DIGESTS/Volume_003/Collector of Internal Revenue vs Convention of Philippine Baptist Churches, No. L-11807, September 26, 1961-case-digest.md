I. CAPTION
COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. CONVENTION OF PHILIPPINE BAPTIST CHURCHES and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-11807, September 26, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
The Supreme Court had previously promulgated a decision on January 28, 1961, declaring certain taxes paid by the respondent Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches to be refundable [1]. The petitioner, Collector of Internal Revenue, filed a motion for clarification regarding the government's liability for interest on these refundable taxes [1]. The Court found that the facts did not show that the taxes in question were collected arbitrarily by the petitioner [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Collector of Internal Revenue is liable for the payment of interest on the refundable taxes.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the Collector of Internal Revenue, representing the Government, is exempt from liability for the payment of interest on the refundable tax [1]. Citing the resolution in *Collector of Internal Revenue v. Antonio Prieto, et al.* (G.R. No. L-11976), the Court held that since the taxes were not collected arbitrarily, the exemption applies [1]. The Court's previous resolution was clarified to reflect this exemption [1].
