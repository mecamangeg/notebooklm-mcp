I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE GUARDIANSHIP OF CARMEN PADILLA VDA. DE BENGSON; CARMEN PADILLA VDA. DE BENGSON v. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK and ADMINISTRATION OF VETERANS AFFAIRS, G.R. No. L-17066, December 28, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Carmen Padilla Vda. de Bengson was adjudged incompetent in 1957, and the Philippine National Bank (PNB) was appointed guardian of her estate, which consisted of US Veterans Administration benefits. In 1960, her son, Francisco Bengson, filed a manifestation seeking to be appointed guardian of the estate in place of PNB. The Court of First Instance of La Union ordered PNB's removal and Francisco's appointment, reasoning that the substitution would save the estate from paying PNB's commission fees and that transferring funds to a local branch would be more convenient. PNB and the Veterans Administration appealed, arguing PNB had discharged its trust satisfactorily and no legal ground existed for removal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the removal of PNB as guardian on the grounds of economy and convenience was valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The removal was illegal. The Supreme Court held that a guardian cannot be legally removed from office except for the causes enumerated in Section 2, Rule 98 of the Rules of Court [now Rule 97]. While courts have discretion in removing guardians, this discretion is limited to inquiring into the existence of statutory grounds, such as incapacity, unsuitability, or conflict of interest (*Alemany v. Moreno*; *Ribaya v. Ribaya*).

In this case, PNB discharged its trust satisfactorily. The mere fact that PNB received legal commissions or that a transfer of administration might be more convenient or economical does not constitute a valid ground for removal. A guardian should not be removed except for the "most cogent reasons."

Orders reversed.
