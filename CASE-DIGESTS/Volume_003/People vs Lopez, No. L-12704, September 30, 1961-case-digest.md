I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FAUSTINO LOPEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-12704, September 30, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On October 29, 1955, in Bantay, Ilocos Sur, Eleuterio Paza and a group of farmers from Barrio Guimod were clearing an irrigation ditch based on a municipal permit. As they returned home, they were ambushed by the accused, farmers from Barrio Malingeb who resented the Guimod farmers' use of the water. Witnesses identified Faustino, Perfecto, and Dominador Lopez pointing firearms at the group, while Valentin Lopez shouted, "Go on, kill them," and Teodorico Lopez shouted, "Go on, nobody has been hit yet. You kill them all." Paza was shot and died from a gunshot wound. The Court of First Instance convicted all five accused of murder. Appellants Perfecto, Dominador, Teodorico, and Valentin appealed, raising the defense of alibi, while the trial court appreciated the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender for Teodorico and Dominador.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the crime committed is murder qualified by treachery.
2. W/N the penalty imposed on appellants Teodorico and Dominador is correct under the Indeterminate Sentence Law.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The crime is murder qualified by treachery because the unsuspecting victim and his companions were fired upon suddenly and without warning, affording them no opportunity to defend themselves [1]. The Court found a conspiracy existed, as the armed attack by some accused and the verbal exhortations by others to "kill them" demonstrated a community of purpose and concerted design [1]. The appellants' defense of alibi was rejected as unbelievable in the face of clear, direct, and positive testimony from prosecution witnesses who saw them taking active part in the crime [2].

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court modified the penalty for Teodorico and Dominador. Since the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender was appreciated without any aggravating circumstances, the maximum penalty is the minimum period of that prescribed by law. Under the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum of the indeterminate sentence must be within the range of the penalty next lower in degree to that prescribed by the Code [3]. The penalty next lower is *Prisión Mayor* maximum to *Reclusion Temporal* medium [4]. Thus, Teodorico and Dominador were sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 10 years and 1 day of *Prisión Mayor* (minimum) to 20 years of *Reclusion Temporal* (maximum) [4].

Judgment modified as to the penalty for Teodorico and Dominador Lopez; affirmed in all other respects.
