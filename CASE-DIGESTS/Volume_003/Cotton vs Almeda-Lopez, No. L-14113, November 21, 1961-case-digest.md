II. FACTS
Petitioner Josephine Cotton filed a motion for reconsideration challenging a portion of a decision that granted costs against her. The record revealed that the respondent, Eugenio S. Baltao, had failed to voluntarily comply with the obligations imposed upon him by the judgment [1, 2]. Baltao only complied with said obligations after the issuance of a court order [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the grant of costs against the petitioner should be sustained despite the respondent's delayed compliance.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court granted the petitioner's motion for reconsideration. The Supreme Court noted that the respondent, Eugenio S. Baltao, complied with the obligations imposed by the judgment only after a court order was issued [2, 3]. Consequently, the Court set aside the decision with respect to the grant of costs to respondent Baltao [2].
