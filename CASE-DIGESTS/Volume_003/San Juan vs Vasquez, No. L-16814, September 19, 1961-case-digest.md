I. CAPTION
EDWARD SAN JUAN v. HONORABLE JUDGE CONRADO VASQUEZ and THE HONORABLE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-16814, September 19, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On June 30, 1954, the Collector (now Commissioner) of Internal Revenue assessed petitioner Edward San Juan for deficiency income taxes. The Collector granted San Juan until July 31, 1954, to submit evidence to dispute the correctness of the assessment [1]. On July 30, 1954, San Juan's accountant submitted a letter explaining why the assessments were not due and requested consideration regarding penalties [1]. The Collector did not reply to this dispute but instead filed a civil action for collection against San Juan in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila on February 25, 1959, seeking P19,704.50 [1, 2]. San Juan moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the CFI lacked jurisdiction because the matter involved a "disputed assessment" which falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [1, 3]. Respondent Judge Vasquez denied the motion to dismiss [3]. San Juan filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to take cognizance of a collection suit involving a disputed tax assessment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the determination of the correctness or incorrectness of a tax assessment to which the taxpayer is not agreeable falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals, not the Court of First Instance [4].

Under **Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125**, the Court of Tax Appeals has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review decisions of the Collector of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments [4, 5]. The Court held that where an assessment is disputed by the taxpayer at the opportune time, the Collector may not ignore such dispute by immediately bringing an action in court to collect, as this would deprive the taxpayer of his right to appeal the disputed assessment [6]. Citing *Blaquera v. Rodriguez*, the Court emphasized that cases involving disputed assessments are beyond the jurisdiction of the CFI [4].

The petition was granted, and the orders of the lower court were set aside [7].
