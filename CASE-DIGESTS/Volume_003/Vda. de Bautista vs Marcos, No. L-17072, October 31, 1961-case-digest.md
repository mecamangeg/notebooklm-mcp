I. CAPTION
CRISTINA MARCELO VDA. DE BAUTISTA v. BRIGIDA MARCOS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17072, October 31, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On May 17, 1954, defendant Brigida Marcos borrowed P2,000 from plaintiff Cristina Marcelo Vda. de Bautista. To secure the loan, Marcos executed a mortgage over a 2-hectare portion of unregistered land in Tarlac, transferring possession to Bautista by way of usufruct. Subsequently, in 1957, Marcos and her sisters obtained a Free Patent and an Original Certificate of Title over the land based on possession since 1915.

When Marcos failed to pay the debt in 1959, Bautista filed an action for payment or foreclosure. Marcos moved to dismiss, arguing that under the Public Land Law, the land could not be taken for debts contracted prior to the expiration of five years from the patent's issuance. The lower court denied the motion and ruled in favor of Bautista, holding the mortgage valid because it was executed before the patent was issued. Marcos appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the mortgage executed before the issuance of the free patent is valid and enforceable.
2. W/N the mortgagee is entitled to the fruits received during her possession despite the invalidity of the mortgage.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The mortgage is void and ineffective. An essential requisite of a valid mortgage is that the mortgagor be the absolute owner of the thing mortgaged (Art. 2085, Civil Code) [1]. At the time the mortgage was constituted in 1954, the land was still part of the public domain and Marcos was not yet the owner. Furthermore, the subsequent acquisition of title via patent does not validate the mortgage. Section 118 of C.A. No. 141 (Public Land Law) prohibits the satisfaction of debts contracted prior to the expiration of five years from the issuance of the patent. This prohibition extends to debts contracted *before* the issuance of the patent to preserve the land for the homesteader's family [1].

2. **YES.** The invalidity of the mortgage contract does not invalidate the collateral agreement transferring possession to the mortgagee in usufruct. Marcos had possessory rights which she validly transferred. Bautista, believing Marcos to be the owner and unaware of the flaw in the mode of acquisition, was a possessor in good faith (Art. 526, Civil Code) and is entitled to all fruits received during her possession (Art. 544, Civil Code) without obligation to account for them [2].

The judgment is **REVERSED** insofar as it orders the foreclosure of the mortgage, but **AFFIRMED** regarding the order for Marcos to pay the principal loan of P2,000.
