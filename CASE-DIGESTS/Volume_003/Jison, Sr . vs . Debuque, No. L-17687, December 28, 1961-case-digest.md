I. CAPTION
JANUARIO L. JISON, SR. v. HON. IGNACIO DEBUQUE, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Capiz, CONCHITA DE VERA and THOMAS J. FORD, G.R. No. L-17687, December 28, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Conchita de Vera filed a motion in a Land Registration Case before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Capiz, presided by Judge Debuque, praying for the cancellation of petitioner Januario L. Jison's certificates of title and the issuance of new ones in her name [1, 2]. She alleged that she acquired the subject properties in Haciendas "Carmen" and "Lucaron" from Julio M. Santos, who in turn bought them from Jison [2]. Jison opposed the motion, arguing that the lower court, acting as a land registration court, lacked jurisdiction because the issue involved a question of ownership which should be litigated in a separate action [3, 4]. The CFI denied Jison's motion to dismiss, holding that it had jurisdiction to determine if the lands sold were the same as those covered by Jison's titles [3]. Jison filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court has jurisdiction to hear the motion for cancellation and issuance of new titles under Section 112 of the Land Registration Act.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that while questions of ownership generally must be ventilated in a separate action in a court of general jurisdiction, this principle does not apply where there is no substantial controversy regarding ownership [4]. In this case, Jison admitted having sold the parcels of land to Santos, who then sold them to De Vera [4]. Since Jison did not question the existence and validity of the sale, the only remaining question was whether the lots sold to De Vera were the same lots covered by Jison's certificates of title [4, 5]. If the identity of the lots is established, the lower court has jurisdiction under **Section 112 of the Land Registration Act** to order the cancellation of the old titles and the issuance of new ones [5].

The petition was denied [5].
