I. CAPTION
THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. ENRIQUE AVELINO, G.R. No. L-14847, September 19, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In 1947, respondent Enrique Avelino invested P60,000.00 in the National Livestock Produce Corporation but did not file an income tax return for that year [1]. Utilizing the net worth method, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) considered this investment as unreported income and assessed Avelino P22,123.55 in deficiency income tax, surcharges, and interests [1, 2].

Avelino contested the assessment, claiming the funds were a loan from one Severino Sayque, a co-organizer who allegedly returned to China in 1948 or 1949 and had not been heard from since [1]. Avelino argued he had no other means, as he was a mere rancher without salary and relied on his wife’s P400 monthly income [3]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) reversed the CIR's decision, giving credence to Avelino's claim that the money was borrowed, noting that the loan was purportedly guaranteed by another organizer, Dr. Fernando Chan [1, 4]. The CIR petitioned the Supreme Court for review, arguing the loan was incredible given the lack of security and Avelino’s lack of assets [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the deficiency income tax assessment based on the net worth method is valid.
2. W/N the compromise penalties imposed by the CIR are valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the assessment was valid and the P60,000.00 constituted unreported income. The Court found Avelino's defense—that the huge sum was a loan from a near-stranger without mortgage security—to be incredible, especially considering Avelino had no funds or property to pay it back [6].

The Court applied the doctrine regarding the net worth method, stating that in civil cases, "the application of the net worth method does not require identification of the sources of the alleged unreported income and that the determination of the tax deficiency by the government is *prima facie* correct" (citing *Eugenio Perez v. CIR*) [7, 8]. Since Avelino admittedly invested P60,000.00, the burden was on him to prove it was borrowed, which he failed to do satisfactorily [8].

2. **NO.** Citing *Collector of Internal Revenue v. University of Santo Tomas*, the Court ruled that compromise penalties cannot be imposed without the agreement of the taxpayer [9].

**Disposition:** The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is REVERSED. The decision of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is AFFIRMED, excluding the compromise penalties [9].
