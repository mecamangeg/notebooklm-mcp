I. CAPTION
MARCOS ALIDO v. FAUSTINO ALAR, G.R. No. L-16822, November 29, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Marcos Alido was a candidate for councilor in Borongan, Samar, during the November 10, 1959 general elections. The election results for the municipality's 41 precincts were recorded in Commission on Elections (C.E.) Form No. 8 and submitted to the respondent, Municipal Treasurer Faustino Alar. Alido demanded certified copies of these election results from Alar, claiming they were public records [1]. Alar refused, arguing that no provision in the Revised Election Code required the Municipal Treasurer to issue such certificates, unlike the Board of Inspectors who are explicitly mandated to do so upon demand [2].

Alido filed a petition for *mandamus* with the Court of First Instance of Samar. The trial court ruled in Alido's favor, ordering Alar to furnish the certified copies [1]. Alar appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the trial court erred in issuing the writ [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N mandamus lies to compel the Municipal Treasurer to issue certified copies of the election results (C.E. Form No. 8).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that *mandamus* has no legal basis in this case. For *mandamus* to lie, the duty sought to be enforced must be clearly and peremptorily enjoined by law or by reason of official station, citing *Tabique v. Duvall* (16 Phil. 324) [4].

The Court found no law requiring a Municipal Treasurer to furnish certified copies of election results to candidates or inhabitants. C.E. Form No. 8 is intended exclusively for the Treasurer to make an "unofficial release" of results to the public and to wire official results to the Commission on Elections [4, 5]. While the public has a right to know the results, this does not translate to a legal right to demand *certified copies* from the Treasurer, which would unnecessarily burden the office. Since Alido failed to establish a clear legal right or a specific duty enjoined upon the respondent, the writ cannot be issued [3, 4].

The decision appealed from is REVERSED, and the case is dismissed with costs against the petitioner [6].
