I. CAPTION
NORTHWEST TRACTOR & EQUIPMENT (PHIL.) CORPORATION v. MORALES SHIPPING COMPANY, INC., No. L-5733, October 19, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Northwest Tractor contracted with Defendant Morales Shipping to transport war surplus machineries from Samar to Manila. Alleging loss of cargo and damages due to the sinking of one vessel and delay/deviation of another, Plaintiff sued Defendant for P80,000 (value of lost cargo) plus other damages [1, 2]. Defendant Morales Shipping filed counterclaims totaling over P300,000 for freight, demurrage, value of the lost vessel, expected profits, and damages to goodwill [3].

The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed both the complaint and the counterclaims [4]. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of fact. On appeal, the Plaintiff reduced its total claim to P85,000, while the Defendant reduced its total claim to P193,000 [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over the case given the amounts involved.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that it lacked appellate jurisdiction because the value of the controversy did not exceed P200,000.

The Court ruled that the "separate total claims of the respective parties and not the combined claims against each other" determine the appellate jurisdictional amount [6]. Citing *Sambrano vs. Rehabilitation Finance Corporation* and *Rio y Cia vs. Vasquez*, the Court observed that the Plaintiff's claim was P85,000 and the Defendant's claim was P193,000 [6]. Since both amounts were less than the P200,000 jurisdictional threshold prescribed by the Judiciary Act of 1948 (Republic Act No. 296), the case fell within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals [6, 7].

The case was **REMANDED** to the Court of Appeals for determination and judgment pursuant to Section 31, in connection with Sections 17 and 29, of Republic Act No. 296 [7].
