I. CAPTION
GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM EMPLOYEES’ ASSOCIATION (GSISEA), et al. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM (GSIS), G.R. No. L-18734, December 30, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners (Unions) and respondent GSIS had an industrial dispute regarding the implementation of salary standardization provisions in their collective bargaining agreement. On August 15, 1961, Executive Secretary Natalio P. Castillo sent a letter to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) "by authority of the President," certifying the dispute as indispensable to the national interest pursuant to Section 10 of Republic Act No. 875 (Magna Charta of Labor). The Unions filed a petition for prohibition to enjoin the CIR from hearing the case, arguing that the certification was invalid because: (1) the President was in the Visayas on that date and could not have signed it; (2) the power to certify cannot be delegated to a cabinet member; and (3) the certification was issued two days before the actual declaration of a strike. The Supreme Court initially dismissed the petition by minute resolution but subsequently issued this extended decision.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the certification of the industrial dispute to the CIR by the Executive Secretary "by authority of the President" is valid.
2. W/N the certification is valid despite being issued before the declaration of a strike.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The certification is valid. The Court held that Section 10 of Republic Act No. 875 does not prescribe a specific form in which the Chief Executive must certify an industrial controversy to the CIR [1, 2]. The Executive Secretary’s letter was not a delegation of power but merely an attestation that the President had ordered the dispute certified [2]. The President's physical absence from Manila does not preclude the issuance of such an order given available communication facilities, and the Executive Secretary enjoys the presumption of regular performance of official duty [3]. Furthermore, evidence showed the President had explicitly approved the request for certification over his signature on August 11 [4].

2. **YES.** The certification is valid even if issued prior to the strike. Section 10 of the Act requires only the existence of an "industrial dispute," not necessarily an existing strike [4]. It was undisputed that the parties had a controversy and that prior conciliation efforts by the Department of Labor had failed [4].

Petition dismissed [5].
