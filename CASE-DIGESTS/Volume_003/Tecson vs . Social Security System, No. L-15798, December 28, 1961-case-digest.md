I. CAPTION
JOSE P. TECSON v. SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-15798, December 28, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Lim Hoc, an employee of Yuyitung Publishing Company, was a member of the Social Security System (SSS). In his SSS Form E-1, he declared his civil status as married but did not list his wife or children, who were residing in Communist China [1, 2]. Instead, he designated the petitioner, Jose P. Tecson, a friend and co-worker, as his beneficiary [1]. Upon Lim Hoc's death on November 3, 1957, Tecson filed a claim for death benefits [1]. The Social Security Commission denied the claim, citing its regulations which listed legitimate spouses and children as primary beneficiaries, allowing the designation of other persons only in the absence of such relatives [3, 4]. Tecson appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the designation of a friend and co-worker as beneficiary is valid despite the existence of the employee's wife and children.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the Social Security Commission's denial was erroneous and ordered the payment of benefits to Tecson.

The Court reasoned that while the general purpose of the SSS is to protect the employee and his family, this intent cannot contradict the clear and explicit provisions of Section 13 of Republic Act No. 1161 (Social Security Act), which mandates that benefits be paid to the "beneficiaries as recorded by his employer" [5, 6]. The Court emphasized that SSS benefits are derived from contributions by the employee and the employer, without government funding; thus, the employee has the right to designate his beneficiary, and the SSS acts merely as a trustee [6].

Furthermore, the Court clarified that the Social Security System is not a law of succession [7]. Under Section 23 of the Act, employers are required to report dependents [7]. Since Lim Hoc did not list his wife and children as dependents—likely due to their residence in Communist China or his express desire to exclude them—and explicitly designated Tecson, the system must honor that designation [2]. The resolution of the Commission was set aside [8].
