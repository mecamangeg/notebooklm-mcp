I. CAPTION
FEDERICO SUNTAY v. FORTUNATO F. HALILI, VIRGILIO I. RAMOS, MAXIMO G. SANTIAGO, and GRACIANO QUEYQUEP, G.R. No. L-12810, September 29, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Federico Suntay, a candidate for Governor of Bulacan in 1951, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon City against defendant Fortunato Halili and others. Suntay sought to annul a lease contract over fishponds and four promissory notes totaling P55,000, alleging they were void for lack of consideration and illegality under the Civil Code and Revised Election Code regarding election expenses. Defendants countered that the transactions were valid financial accommodations for Suntay’s campaign and filed a counterclaim seeking roughly P120,000 in payments and damages.

The CFI rendered judgment declaring the contracts void as illegal bargains prohibited by election laws and finding the parties in *pari delicto*. Both Suntay and Halili appealed directly to the Supreme Court. Suntay assigned errors regarding the lack of award for the use of his property (claiming P64,000), while Halili questioned the trial court's factual findings regarding the nature of the transaction and the credibility of witnesses.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that it lacked appellate jurisdiction to decide the case. The Court noted that both appellants assailed the findings of fact made by the trial court. Furthermore, the amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff was only P64,000, and the total amount sought by the defendants in their counterclaim was P120,000. Since both parties raised questions of fact and the total amount involved was less than P200,000, the case fell within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals pursuant to Section 31, in connection with Sections 17 and 29 of Republic Act No. 296 (The Judiciary Act of 1948), as amended.

Case remanded to the Court of Appeals for determination and judgment.
