I. CAPTION
GREGORIA BARTOLO v. PRIMO G. MALIWANAG and HONORABLE NICASIO YATCO, G.R. No. L-17237, December 28, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Gregoria Bartolo was the plaintiff in Civil Case No. Q-3927 before the Court of First Instance of Rizal presided by respondent Judge Nicasio Yatco [1, 2]. After the trial court rendered a decision favorable to respondent Primo Maliwanag, Bartolo filed a record on appeal [2]. Maliwanag objected, citing the non-inclusion of various pleadings such as the motion to dismiss, opposition, and a specific "Manifestation" dated March 18, 1959 [2]. Judge Yatco ordered the inclusion of these documents [2]. Bartolo filed multiple motions for reconsideration, arguing against the inclusion of the "Manifestation" and requesting the inclusion of the court order denying the motion to dismiss, which were all denied [2]. Instead of complying with the order to amend the record, Bartolo filed a petition for *mandamus* to compel the judge to exclude the manifestation, include the order denying the motion to dismiss, and certify the record on appeal [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N *mandamus* lies to compel the trial judge to certify the record on appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The determination of what matters should be included in a record on appeal is addressed to the sound discretion of the judge who heard the case, as they are aware of the questions and issues raised [3]. **Mandamus** will not lie to compel a court to certify an amended record on appeal which is not in accordance with **Section 7 of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court** and which does not include all the papers required by the court to be included therein [4, 5].

The Court further noted that the petitioner failed to present an amended record on appeal containing the required papers and wasted six months before filing the petition, suggesting the action was filed purely for delay [5].

Petition dismissed [3].
