I. CAPTION
THE EARNSHAWS DOCKS & HONOLULU IRON WORKS v. GIMENEZ, G.R. No. L-14814, December 30, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Earnshaws Docks, a corporation licensed to do business in the Philippines, received dollar commissions in its New York office during the effectivity of Republic Act No. 601 (Foreign Exchange Tax Law). Instead of selling these dollar receipts to the Central Bank (CB) as required by CB Circulars Nos. 20 and 42, petitioner requested and obtained CB authority to utilize the funds abroad to purchase shares of stock in Hawaiian-Philippine Co. and San Carlos Milling Co., Ltd. Subsequently, the CB demanded payment of the 17% special excise tax on the foreign exchange utilized. Petitioner paid under protest and sought a refund from the Auditor General, arguing that the tax applies only to foreign exchange actually "sold" by the CB, and no such sale occurred since petitioner used its own funds. The Auditor General denied the claim.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is liable for the 17% special excise tax on dollar earnings utilized abroad with Central Bank authority.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Under Central Bank Circulars Nos. 20 and 42, the petitioner was legally obligated to surrender or sell its dollar earnings to the CB within one business day of receipt. By applying for a license to use the funds abroad, the petitioner implicitly admitted this obligation. The Court held that the authority granted by the CB was merely an accommodation to avoid the "red tape" of requiring the petitioner to physically surrender the dollars and then immediately re-purchase them. Consequently, the transaction must be deemed equivalent to a surrender (sale) of the dollars to the CB and a subsequent purchase of the foreign exchange by the petitioner, which triggers the tax liability under R.A. No. 601. The Central Bank has no authority to waive the collection of the excise tax provided by law. The decision of the Auditor General is affirmed.
