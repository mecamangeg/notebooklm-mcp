I. CAPTION
MANILA CORDAGE COMPANY v. HON. MAGNO GATMAITAN AND HARRY M. IKDAL, G.R. No. L-17135, December 28, 1961, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Harry M. Ikdal filed a complaint against petitioner Manila Cordage Company (MCC) for breach of contract and unpaid commissions [1]. During discovery, MCC failed to satisfactorily answer Ikdal’s interrogatories regarding gross sales figures [2, 3]. Consequently, the trial court declared MCC in default on July 23, 1959 [3]. MCC challenged this default order via a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-15883), but the Court dismissed it for lack of merit on September 10, 1959 [4, 5].

Upon the return of the case to the lower court, Ikdal presented evidence *ex parte*. Respondent Judge Gatmaitan rendered a decision ordering MCC to pay Ikdal P2,348.92 plus damages and fees [5, 6]. A writ of execution was issued [6]. MCC then filed the present petition, again questioning the declaration of default and the judgment rendered thereon, and obtained a preliminary injunction to stop the execution [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition challenging the default order and subsequent judgment should be granted despite the dismissal of a previous similar petition.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court dismissed the petition and dissolved the preliminary injunction [8]. The Court found that the matters raised in the present petition were "basically identical" to those already raised and determined in the previous case (G.R. No. L-15883), which had been dismissed for lack of merit [7]. The Court held that it "does not trifle with petitions like this," describing the allegations as mere repetitions intended "either to mislead the Court or to delay legal proceedings" [8]. Since no new grounds were alleged to merit a modification of the previous resolution, the dismissal was reiterated [7].
