I. CAPTION
NARIC WORKERS’ UNION v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and NATIONAL RICE AND CORN CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-14999, December 30, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On November 10, 1952, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) issued an order in a pending case enjoining the National Rice and Corn Corporation (NARIC) from dismissing employees without just cause or court authority [1]. On December 27, 1953, NARIC dismissed Bienvenido Hementera, a warehouseman at its Cabanatuan Branch, for an alleged irregularity involving empty sacks [2, 3].

Nearly three years later, on November 16, 1956, the Naric Workers’ Union filed a petition with the CIR for Hementera's reinstatement, alleging his dismissal violated the 1952 injunctive order [2]. NARIC moved to dismiss, arguing justifiable cause and that the petition was filed out of time. The CIR dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, noting Hementera was not a union member and the case involved no unfair labor practice [4, 5]. The Union appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action for reinstatement is barred by prescription or laches.
2. W/N the CIR has jurisdiction over the case.
3. W/N the petitioner Union has the legal capacity to sue on behalf of a non-member.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The action is barred. The Court held that an action for reinstatement of a civil service eligible must be filed within one year from dismissal (*Mesias v. Jover*). If the employee is not eligible, laches sets in if the action is brought after three years, as the employee is deemed to have abandoned his rights (*Gutierrez v. Bachrach Motor Co.*). Hementera waited almost three years to file, and his claim of illness was insufficient to excuse the delay in consulting a lawyer [7, 8].

2. **NO.** The CIR lacks jurisdiction. CIR jurisdiction extends only to labor disputes involving industries indispensable to national interest, minimum wage controversies, hours of employment, or unfair labor practices (ULP) where an employer-employee relationship exists or reinstatement is sought [9]. Here, no employment relationship existed at the time of filing, and no ULP was involved. The case is a mere money claim or breach of private right cognizable by regular courts (*National Labor Union v. Insular-Yebana Tobacco Corp.*) [10].

3. **NO.** A labor union exceeds its legitimate purpose if allowed to prosecute cases for employees who are not members. Hementera was not a member of the petitioner Union. A suit brought by a representative on behalf of a real party in interest is defective (*Hilario v. La Congregacion de San Vicente de Paul*) [11].

Petition dismissed [12].
