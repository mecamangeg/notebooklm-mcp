I. CAPTION
MARIA DY and DANIEL TUAL v. BAUTISTA KUIZON, G.R. No. L-16654, November 30, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On May 2, 1951, respondent Bautista Kuizon filed a complaint for forcible entry and detainer against petitioners Maria Dy and Daniel Tual. Kuizon alleged that on June 8, 1950, the petitioners forcibly entered his fishpond, cut the fence, demolished a *camarin* and shed, and destroyed the dikes, causing *bangus* fry to escape [1]. The Justice of the Peace Court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction after Dy claimed ownership of the property [2].

On appeal, the Court of First Instance (CFI) ordered the petitioners to pay Kuizon P6,000.00 for improvements, P2,000.00 for the lost *bangus* fry, and P1,000.00 in attorney’s fees [2]. The CFI did not order the petitioners to vacate the premises. The petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA). Kuizon (respondent) did not appeal [3]. The CA modified the decision, reducing the damages but adding an order for the petitioners to vacate the area and surrender possession to Kuizon [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Appeals could order the petitioners to vacate the premises when the trial court did not grant such relief and the respondent did not appeal.
2. W/N the award of P2,000.00 for the value of the *bangus* fry was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court of Appeals erred in ordering the petitioners to vacate. It is a well-settled rule that whenever an appeal is taken in a civil case, an appellee who has not himself appealed cannot obtain from the appellate court any affirmative relief other than what was granted in the decision of the lower court [3]. Since the CFI did not order the petitioners to vacate and Kuizon did not appeal that decision, the CA could not grant him that additional relief [3]. An appellee may only assign errors to maintain the judgment on other grounds, not to modify or reverse it to his advantage [3, 5].

2. **YES.** The award was proper. The P2,000.00 represents the value of the *bangus* fry which escaped due to the destruction of the dikes [6]. These fry constitute the "fruits" of the property [6]. In actions for forcible entry, the plaintiff is entitled to damages caused by the loss of use and occupation of the property, including the collection of its fruits [7]. Furthermore, the proceedings in the CFI were effectively converted into a case for revindication, rendering the nature of the damages immaterial [8].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **MODIFIED**. Petitioners are ordered to pay respondent P2,000.00 damages with legal interest, plus P500.00 attorney's fees; the order to vacate is deleted [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Labrador and Reyes, J.B.L., JJ., concurred in the result [10].
