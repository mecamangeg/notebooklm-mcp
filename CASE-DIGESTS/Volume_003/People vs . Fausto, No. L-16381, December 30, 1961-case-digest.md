I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ANTONIO FAUSTO Y TOMAS**, G.R. No. L-16381, December 30, 1961, Barrera, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On August 7, 1957, appellant Antonio Fausto stabbed Dr. Antonio Casal 18 times outside St. Joseph Hospital in Manila, resulting in Casal's death [3, 4]. Fausto was arrested immediately and admitted to the killing, surrendering the knife [3]. The defense admitted authorship of the crime but claimed exemption from criminal liability due to insanity [4]. Evidence presented showed Fausto was confined at the National Mental Hospital from June 27 to July 9, 1956 (over a year before the crime) and diagnosed with schizophrenia, but was discharged against medical advice [4]. He was also confined for observation by court order from October 1958 to March 1959 [5]. The Court of First Instance of Manila convicted him of murder qualified by evident premeditation, rejecting the insanity defense [2, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused is exempt from criminal liability on the ground of insanity. [7]

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction [8]. The burden of proving insanity rests on the accused, as the law presumes acts punishable by law are voluntary and that the accused is in his right mind [7].

The Court found Fausto was not insane at the time of the commission of the crime [6]. First, his confinement in 1956 was too brief (13 days) to form an accurate diagnosis, and he was observed to be coherent and intelligent during interviews at that time [9, 10]. Second, the medical findings from his 1958 confinement were too remote from the date of the crime [11]. Crucially, a statement given by Fausto just three hours after the killing showed he was mentally sound; he narrated in detail how he had reflected on and planned the killing the day before if the victim refused to give him a certification for re-employment [12, 13].

The crime was classified as Murder qualified by evident premeditation, as Fausto planned the killing one day prior [14]. The aggravating circumstance of treachery was present due to the suddenness of the attack, but was offset by the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender [8, 14]. The judgment of the lower court imposing *reclusión perpetua* was affirmed *in toto* [8].
