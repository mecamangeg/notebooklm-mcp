I. CAPTION
JOSE S. FRANCISCO, ET AL. v. TIMOTEO CERTEZA, SR. and CONCHITA V. CERTEZA, G.R. No. L-16849, November 29, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs are the heirs of Gabriel Francisco and Maria Sumulong, who acquired two parcels of land under the free patent provisions of Act No. 926. Upon the parents' death, plaintiffs adjudicated the properties to themselves and were issued Transfer Certificates of Title. On November 26, 1954, plaintiffs sold the lots to defendants for P6,515.60. On January 26, 1959, plaintiffs filed a complaint to repurchase the properties based on Section 119 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 (Public Land Act), which allows repurchase within five years from conveyance. Defendants refused, arguing that since the land was acquired under Act No. 926 (which contained no repurchase provision), the repurchase provision of the subsequent Act No. 2874 (incorporated in CA 141) should not apply. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of plaintiffs, ordering defendants to resell the land.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the right of repurchase under Section 119 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 applies to the conveyance of land originally acquired under the earlier Act No. 926.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. Relying on *Isaac v. Tan Chuan Leong*, the Court held that the provision on repurchase in Section 117 of Act No. 2874 (now Section 119 of CA 141) applies to "every conveyance" of land acquired under free patent or homestead provisions. The application of this law is not retroactive because the operative act is the conveyance (the sale), which occurred in 1954 when the repurchase provision was already in full force. The Court emphasized that while a patent converts public land to private property, such land remains subject to the limitations and restrictions imposed by the Public Land Law. The defendants, having purchased the land in 1954, are presumed to know the legal provisions applicable to such sales.

Petition denied; decision affirmed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Padilla, J.** dissented, reiterating his position in *Isaac v. Tan Chuan Leong* (G.R. No. L-3324) regarding the non-applicability of the repurchase provision to earlier grants.
