I. CAPTION
GONZALO MERCADO, ET AL. v. RAMON LIRA and JUANA C. DE LIRA; NITA LIRA v. GONZALO MERCADO, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-13328-29 and L-13358, September 29, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Gonzalo Mercado and others owned and operated the Laguna Transportation Company [1]. On April 21, 1951, their bus No. 39 was traveling from Batangas to Manila when its left front tire blew out at Calamba, Laguna [1]. The bus swerved and fell into a ravine, resulting in the death of passenger Ramon Lira, Jr. and physical injuries to passenger Nita Lira [1].

Two cases were filed in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Batangas: one by the parents of Ramon Jr. (Ramon and Juana Lira) for death, and another by Nita Lira for injuries [1]. The CFI awarded damages in both cases [1]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) modified the judgments [2]. For the parents, the CA awarded P4,000 in moral damages among other indemnities [3]. For Nita Lira, the CA initially increased moral damages but, upon a motion for reconsideration, issued a resolution eliminating the award of moral damages entirely, ruling they were not recoverable for physical injuries in a breach of contract [4].

Mercado et al. petitioned the Supreme Court arguing the moral damages awarded to the parents were excessive and should be reduced to a nominal P500 [5]. Nita Lira petitioned arguing she was entitled to moral damages, claiming her case was analogous to quasi-delicts causing physical injuries under Article 2219 of the Civil Code [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the heirs of the deceased passenger are entitled to moral damages for breach of contract of carriage, and if the amount awarded was proper.
2. W/N a passenger who suffers physical injuries is entitled to moral damages for breach of contract of carriage in the absence of fraud or bad faith.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Article 1764 of the Civil Code, Article 2206 applies to the death of a passenger caused by a breach of contract by a common carrier [6]. Article 2206(3) expressly provides that the spouse, descendants, and ascendants of the deceased may demand moral damages for mental anguish by reason of the death [7]. This award is not merely nominal but must be commensurate with the suffering. The Court found the CA's award of P4,000 fair and reasonable given the parents' anguish [3].

2. **NO.** Moral damages are not recoverable in actions for damages predicated on a breach of contract of transportation unless there is evidence of fraud, malice, or bad faith [8, 9]. The Court ruled that a breach of contract cannot be considered an "analogous case" to quasi-delicts under Article 2219 [10]. Article 2220 specifically limits moral damages in contract breaches to cases where the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith [11]. In this case, the cause of the accident was a tire blowout and overspeeding, which constitutes negligence (*culpa contractual*), not the fraud or malice required by law [12]. Mere carelessness of the driver does not *per se* justify an inference of malice or bad faith [13].

**Disposition:** The decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED [12].
