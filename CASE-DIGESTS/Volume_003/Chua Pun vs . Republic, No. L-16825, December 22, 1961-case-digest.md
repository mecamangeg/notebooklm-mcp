I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. CHUA PUN baptized as LEONCIO SY PENG BEN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16825, December 22, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner-appellant Chua Pun filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Manila. To support his petition, he presented two character witnesses, Felicisimo Trinidad and Constancia Aranda. Trinidad testified that Chua Pun’s reputation was "very good," while Aranda testified that he was a "law-abiding citizen." Neither witness testified that the petitioner was "morally irreproachable," nor did they provide specific facts to prove such character. Furthermore, the witnesses had only known the petitioner since 1945 and 1946, respectively, despite Chua Pun having arrived in the Philippines in 1924. Trinidad’s association with the petitioner was limited to being a customer at the petitioner's soda fountain and a rental collector. The trial court denied the petition for failure to prove that the petitioner was morally irreproachable. Chua Pun appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the character witnesses presented were sufficient to establish the petitioner's qualifications for naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision denying the petition. The Court held that character witnesses must prove at trial that the applicant is "morally irreproachable," as required by Section 2, paragraph 3 of Commonwealth Act No. 473. Mere testimony that an applicant is "very good" or "law-abiding" is insufficient, as the law requires a higher standard of character [1, 2]. The witnesses failed to establish specific facts to infer this irreproachability and could not vouch for the petitioner's conduct during his *entire* period of residence in the Philippines, having only known him since 1945 and 1946 [1].

Additionally, the witnesses were not considered "credible persons" within the meaning of the Naturalization Law. A credible person is not merely someone without a criminal record, but one with good standing in the community, known to be honest and upright, and whose word is a good warranty of the petitioner's worthiness [3]. The witnesses' limited association with the petitioner was insufficient to qualify them to testify on his character [1].
