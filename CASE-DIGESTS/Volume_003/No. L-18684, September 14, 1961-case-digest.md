I. CAPTION
LAMBERTO MACIAS, ET AL. v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND VICENTE GELLA, G.R. No. L-18684, September 14, 1961, 3 SCRA 1, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, consisting of four members of the House of Representatives and the Governor of Negros Oriental, filed an original action to declare Republic Act No. 3040 unconstitutional and to enjoin the Commission on Elections and the National Treasurer from implementing it. RA 3040 apportioned representative districts in the Philippines based on a preliminary 1960 census report [1-3]. Petitioners alleged that the Act was void because: (a) it was passed without printed final copies furnished to Members at least three days prior to passage; (b) it was approved more than three years after the census return; and (c) it violated the Constitutional mandate of proportional representation based on the number of inhabitants [2, 4]. Specifically, petitioners argued their provinces were discriminated against; for example, Rizal (with more inhabitants) was given fewer districts than Cebu, and Cotabato (with more inhabitants) was given fewer than Manila [3, 5]. Respondents argued that petitioners lacked legal standing and that the apportionment was a political question beyond the Court's jurisdiction [4, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioners have the legal standing (personality) to institute the action.
2. W/N the validity of a legislative apportionment act is a justiciable question subject to judicial review.
3. W/N Republic Act No. 3040 is unconstitutional for violating the principle of proportional representation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Petitioners, as voters, congressmen, and governor of the aggrieved provinces, have the personality to sue [7]. Citizens who are deprived of as full and effective an elective franchise as they are entitled to under the Constitution by an apportionment act have sufficient interest to proceed in court to test the statute [7].

2. **YES.** The constitutionality of a legislative apportionment act is a judicial question, not a purely political one [8, 9]. District apportionment laws are subject to review by the courts to ensure compliance with constitutional limitations [6, 10]. The mere impact of the suit upon the political situation does not render it political instead of judicial [11].

3. **YES.** Republic Act No. 3040 is unconstitutional. The Constitution directs that Members of the House of Representatives "shall be apportioned among the several provinces as nearly as may be according to the number of their respective inhabitants" [12]. The Act violated this provision by allotting fewer representatives to provinces with larger populations (e.g., Rizal and Cotabato) compared to provinces with smaller populations (e.g., Cebu and Manila) [5, 12]. Such disproportion of representation violates the principle of proportional representation prescribed by the Constitution and is sufficient to avoid the apportionment law [13, 14].

**ACCORDINGLY,** Republic Act No. 3040 is declared unconstitutional and void [1, 15].
