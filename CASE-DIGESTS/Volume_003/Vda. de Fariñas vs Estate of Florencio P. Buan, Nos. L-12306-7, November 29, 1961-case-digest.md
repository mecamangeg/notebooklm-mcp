I. CAPTION
ROSA L. VDA. DE FARIÑAS v. ESTATE OF FLORENCIO P. BUAN, G.R. Nos. L-12306-7, November 29, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rosa L. Vda. de Fariñas held Certificates of Public Convenience (CPC) authorizing the operation of eleven (11) buses on various routes, including Laoag-Manila and Bacarra-Manila. On November 17, 1955, she applied to register five additional units to complete her authorized number. Respondent Estate of Florencio P. Buan filed a petition to cancel her time schedules, alleging abandonment because Fariñas had registered and operated only four (4) units from 1952 to 1956.

Fariñas admitted to the incomplete registration but claimed the failure was due to "successive accidents and personal misfortunes" (including the death of relatives and loss of trucks) which left her confused, despite having the financial capacity to buy new units. The Public Service Commission (PSC) denied her application and cancelled the lines corresponding to the unregistered units, ruling that the abandonment was willful and deliberate. Fariñas appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the cancellation of the petitioner’s Certificate of Public Convenience due to abandonment of service was proper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the PSC's decision. An operator who unjustifiably abandons her service for two or three years by not registering the necessary equipment forfeits her right to the service authorized [1].

The Court rejected the petitioner's defense, holding that personal misfortunes and accidents do not constitute circumstances beyond control (force majeure) sufficient to excuse abandonment. To be considered excusable, the supervening cause must be external, such as a market shortage of trucks, rather than a personal situation [2, 3]. Furthermore, the petitioner failed to apply for authority to suspend operations or defer registration, violating the rules of the Commission. Under Section 16(n) of Act No. 146 (Public Service Act), such violation authorizes the PSC to suspend or revoke the certificate [4].

The petition was dismissed and the decision of the Public Service Commission was affirmed [5].
