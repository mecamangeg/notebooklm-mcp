I. CAPTION
JOSE O. DURAN and TERESA DIAZ VDA. DE DURAN vs. BERNABE OLIVIA, FE ALMAZAN, HEIRS OF VICENTE GODESANO, MANUEL ARCE and ESPERANZA SALUD, G.R. No. L-16589, September 29, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On December 3, 1952, petitioners Jose O. Duran and Teresa Diaz Vda. de Duran filed an application with the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur to register sixteen lots under Plan PSU-128386 [1]. On August 27, 1958, the oppositors filed a motion to dismiss the application regarding specific lots (Lots 3, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, and 16), arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction because said lots were already registered and covered by valid Original Certificates of Title issued pursuant to homestead and sales patents [1]. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the application with respect to the titled lots [1]. The petitioners appealed, contending that a motion to dismiss is not available in land registration cases and that a certificate of title based on a patent does not confer indefeasibility [2], [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a motion to dismiss is available in land registration proceedings.
2. W/N the trial court has jurisdiction to entertain an application for registration of land already covered by a Torrens title issued via a public land patent.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Rules of Court apply to land registration cases in a suppletory character whenever practicable and convenient, pursuant to Rule 132 (now Rule 143) [2]. Since the Land Registration Act does not provide for a pleading similar to a motion to dismiss, and such a motion is necessary for the expeditious termination of cases, it may be availed of by the parties [4], [2].

2. **NO.** A homestead or sales patent, once registered under the Land Registration Act (Act 496), becomes as indefeasible as a Torrens title and cannot thereafter be the subject of a subsequent registration proceeding [5], [6]. The primary purpose of the Torrens system is to finally settle titles to land; thus, a Court of First Instance has no jurisdiction to decree again the registration of land already decreed in an earlier case [7], [8]. A second decree for the same land is null and void (*Pamintuan v. San Agustin*), and the later applicant is chargeable with notice that the land is already registered [9].

The orders appealed from are **AFFIRMED** [10].
