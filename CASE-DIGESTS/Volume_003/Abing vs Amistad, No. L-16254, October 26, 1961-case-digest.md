**I. CAPTION**
GREGORIO ABING, ET AL. v. AGO AMISTAD, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16254, October 26, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondents Amistad et al. filed for the reopening of the Baguio Townsite Reservation case under Republic Act No. 931. The trial court adjudged the registration of two parcels of land in their favor, finding continuous possession since before July 26, 1894. A decree of registration was issued on July 10, 1958, and the Original Certificate of Title was entered on July 21, 1958. Subsequently, the Amistad heirs sold the land to Gregoria Arnaldo.

Petitioners Abing et al., occupants of the land, filed a petition for review of the decree on April 21, 1959. They alleged that they had been in continuous possession of portions of the property since July 4, 1945, and that they had a verbal agreement with the Amistads to secure a free patent for all of them. They claimed the Amistads committed fraud by registering the land solely in their own names. The lower court dismissed the petition, ruling that the allegations did not constitute actual fraud and that there was an innocent purchaser for value [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N petitioners can invoke Section 38 of Act No. 496 to review the decree of registration based on fraud.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that petitioners cannot avail of the benefit of Section 38 of Act No. 496 primarily because the land they claim is not private in nature but belongs to the public domain. The remedy under Section 38 applies to private lands. Even if the application of said section were extended to holders of imperfect titles under the Public Land Law (Section 48[b] C.A. No. 141), the petitioners' claim would still fail because their occupation began only on July 4, 1945, which is insufficient. Moreover, petitioners' assertion that the agreement was for the respondents to secure a "free patent" from the government constitutes an admission that the land belongs to the government and cannot be the subject of private registration review [7], [8], [9].

The Order appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
