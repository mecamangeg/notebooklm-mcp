I. CAPTION
**NATIONAL SHIPYARDS AND STEEL CORPORATION v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and DOMINADOR MALONDRAS**, G.R. No. L-17068, December 30, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner National Shipyards and Steel Corporation (NASSCO), a government-owned corporation, employed respondent Dominador Malondras as a bargeman. To meet service exigencies, bargemen were required to stay on their barges and were provided living quarters and a subsistence allowance of P1.50 per day. Malondras and 38 other crew members filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) for overtime compensation. NASSCO stipulated that the crew worked in excess of eight hours when required.

A court examiner initially computed overtime for the crew at an average of five (5) hours a day for 1957, which NASSCO paid. Malondras was excluded from a subsequent report covering 1954-1956 because his time sheets were missing. Upon locating the records, Malondras sought payment for said period. The examiner found that Malondras' time sheets marked him as "Detailed on Board" for 24 hours. Consequently, the examiner credited him with 16 hours of overtime daily (24 hours minus 8 regular hours). The CIR approved this report and ordered NASSCO to pay Malondras based on 16 overtime hours a day. NASSCO appealed, arguing Malondras should only be paid for actual service rendered, not for the entire time he was on board.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a seaman is entitled to overtime pay for the entire period he is required to stay on board (16 hours in excess of the 8-hour shift), even if not actually working.
2. W/N the subsistence allowance received by the seaman should be deducted from his overtime compensation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the mere fact that a seaman is required to be on board his vessel all day to be liable for call to duty does not imply he must be paid overtime for all hours in excess of his regular shift. The correct criterion in determining whether sailors are entitled to overtime pay is not whether they were on board and could not leave, but whether they **actually rendered service** in excess of eight hours [1]. Citing *Luzon Stevedoring Co., Inc. v. Luzon Marine Department Union*, the Court emphasized that it is not the purpose of the law to pay overtime when an employee is resting or sleeping [1]. However, since NASSCO admitted that Malondras rendered overtime service when required, and his co-workers were paid based on an average of **five (5) hours** of overtime daily, the Court modified the award to credit Malondras with five overtime hours per day instead of sixteen [2, 3].

2. **NO.** The stipulation of facts showed that the subsistence allowance was independent of overtime compensation [3]. The allowance was provided because bargemen were required to live on the barges. Since NASSCO paid other claimants without deducting this allowance, there was no valid reason to single out Malondras for such deduction [3].

**Disposition:** The appealed order is **MODIFIED**. Respondent Malondras is credited with five (5) overtime hours instead of sixteen (16) hours a day for the periods in question. The case is remanded to determine his exact daily wage from January 1 to September 1954 for computation. In all other respects, the judgment is **AFFIRMED**.
