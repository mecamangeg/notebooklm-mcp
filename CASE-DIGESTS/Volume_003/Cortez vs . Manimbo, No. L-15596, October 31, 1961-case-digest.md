I. CAPTION
RUFINO M. CORTEZ v. FLORENTINO MANIMBO, G.R. No. L-15596, October 31, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Florentino and Tomas Manimbo were lessees on a month-to-month basis of a parcel of land in Tondo, Manila. The land was originally owned by Pedro Cruz, who sold it to Rufino Cortez in 1952. At the time of the sale, Cortez knew the lessees had built houses (*barong-barongs*) on the property. In 1956, Cortez filed complaints for ejectment and recovery of rentals against the Manimbos in the Municipal Court of Manila, which ruled in his favor. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila affirmed the decision, ordering the lessees to vacate the premises, remove their improvements, and pay arrears. The lessees appealed, arguing they were entitled to reimbursement for the value of their houses as builders/possessors in good faith. The Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved purely questions of law. During the pendency of the appeal, the lessees removed their houses.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N lessees are entitled to reimbursement for improvements made on the leased premises as possessors in good faith.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's judgment. A lessee cannot be considered a possessor in good faith because, as a lessee, he acknowledges that he is not the owner of the premises and that his occupation continues only during the life of the lease [1]. Therefore, the rules on builders in good faith (Articles 361 and 453 of the Old Civil Code) do not apply to lessees [2]. Instead, the right of a lessee regarding improvements is governed by specific provisions (Articles 1573 and 487 of the Old Civil Code), which establish that a lessee has no right to indemnification for useful expenses or improvements [1, 3]. The lessee's only right is to remove the improvements if it is possible to do so without injury or damage to the leased property [3, 4]. Since the lessees had already removed their houses, there were no improvements left for which they could claim reimbursement [5].

Appeal dismissed; judgment affirmed.
