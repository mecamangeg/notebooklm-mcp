I. CAPTION
"Y" SHIPPING CORPORATION v. AGUSTIN BORCELIS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16538, October 27, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Agustin Borcelis filed a claim for compensation against petitioner "Y" Shipping Corporation for injuries sustained while working as a truck driver [1]. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded Borcelis P742.81, which became final after the Supreme Court dismissed the corporation's petition for certiorari [1], [2]. Subsequently, a WCC Commissioner issued a writ of execution to enforce the award pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 20-A [2]. The corporation moved to recall the writ, arguing the WCC lacked the power to issue it, but the motion was denied [2]. The corporation then filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of First Instance of Manila, which dismissed the petition and upheld the WCC's authority [2]. The corporation appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Workmen’s Compensation Commission has the power to issue a writ of execution to enforce its decisions.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Workmen’s Compensation Commission cannot validly issue writs of execution. Relying on *Pastoral v. Commissioners of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission* (G.R. No. L-12903), the Court held that the power to execute a judgment is "essentially a judicial power or function of the court" [3]. The Reorganization Acts cannot validly confer this power upon the WCC, as doing so would diminish the jurisdiction and judicial power vested by law in the courts of record [3]. The proper procedure under the law is for the interested party to file a certified copy of the WCC's final decision in a court of record, which will then issue a judgment based on said decision and enforce it via a writ of execution [4]. The writ issued by the WCC is declared null and void [5].

The order appealed from is SET ASIDE [5].
