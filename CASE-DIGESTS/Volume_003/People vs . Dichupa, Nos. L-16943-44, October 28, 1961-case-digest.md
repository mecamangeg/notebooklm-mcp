I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DICHUPA, G.R. Nos. L-16943-44, October 28, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
David Dichupa, the President and Warehouseman of the Pavia Farmers’ Cooperative Marketing Association (FACOMA), was charged under two separate informations for estafa. The first information covered acts committed from January to December 1955, while the second covered acts from January to July 1956. Dichupa filed a motion to quash, arguing that the acts constituted only one offense committed within "one continuous period" and should be consolidated. The lower court dismissed the cases, ruling that the series of acts constituted a single offense and citing *U.S. v. Paraiso* to support the view that they should have been charged in one information. The government appealed the dismissal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the acts of estafa committed during two different periods constitute a single continuous crime.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the acts were committed on two different occasions, meaning they could not have been committed with only one criminal intent [1]. It cannot be pretended that when the accused disposed of palay in 1955, he already entertained the criminal intent to dispose of palay that was yet to be deposited in 1956 [1]. Citing *People v. Cid*, the Court explained that malversations committed on distinct occasions are not the result of a single resolution but of separate misappropriations [2, 3]. The lower court's reliance on *U.S. v. Paraiso* was misplaced because that case involved a single information containing multiple crimes which the accused failed to object to, whereas this case involves separate informations for distinct acts [4]. Even if the acts constituted a single crime, the proper remedy was the consolidation of the informations, not their dismissal [5]. The order of the lower court was set aside and the case was remanded for further proceedings [6].
