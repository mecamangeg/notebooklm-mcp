I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. YU GO KEE and VICENTE SUN, G.R. Nos. L-16155-57, November 29, 1961, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
Lim Bun Chuan filed a complaint for falsification against Yu Go Kee, while Yu Go Kee's wife filed for estafa against Lim Bun Chuan with the Manila City Fiscal's Office. Fiscal Mayo conducted a joint preliminary investigation where the parties were present and heard [1]. Lim Bun Chuan included Vicente Sun as a co-defendant [1]. After the investigation, Fiscal Mayo recommended the dismissal of both cases [2]. However, Second Assistant City Fiscal Gonzales, Chief of the Prosecution Division, reviewed the case and disagreed with the recommendation [2]. Relying solely on the evidence submitted to Fiscal Mayo without conducting a new hearing, Gonzales filed three informations for falsification against Yu Go Kee and Sun [2]. The accused moved to quash, arguing that Gonzales did not conduct a valid preliminary investigation. Judge Bayona dismissed the informations, ruling that Gonzales did not personally investigate the case and that the actual investigating fiscal had recommended dismissal [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a reviewing Fiscal may validly file an information based on the preliminary investigation of another Fiscal who recommended dismissal, without conducting a new hearing of the witnesses.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that a valid preliminary investigation preceded the filing of the informations [5]. The review performed by Fiscal Gonzales was merely a continuation of the preliminary investigation conducted by Fiscal Mayo [5]. Under Section 38-C of Republic Act No. 409 (Revised Charter of the City of Manila), the law only requires that the accused be given a chance to be heard and to cross-examine witnesses prior to the filing of the information [6, 7]. There is no provision requiring a reviewing Fiscal to subpoena and hear anew the same witnesses who appeared before another Fiscal who merely recommended dismissal [7]. Unless a case is finally dismissed by the City Fiscal, recommendations made by subordinates are mere incidents in the same investigation [7]. Furthermore, under Section 38-A of R.A. No. 409, the City Fiscal has the authority to designate a Fiscal to review the findings and recommendations of another [8].

The orders of dismissal were set aside, and the records were remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [9].
