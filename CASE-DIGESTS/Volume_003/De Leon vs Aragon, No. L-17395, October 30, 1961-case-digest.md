I. CAPTION
ISIDRO DE LEON v. JUDGE CRISANTO ARAGON, PACITA TUASON-PRINCIPE, and FEDERICO PRINCIPE, G.R. No. L-17395, October 30, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On January 5, 1960, respondents Pacita Tuason-Principe and her husband filed an ejectment suit (illegal detainer) against petitioner Isidro de Leon in the Municipal Court of Manila to recover possession of a leased parcel of land [1]. The complaint alleged the residence of the plaintiff (Manila) and the defendant (Makati), but failed to specifically allege the location of the disputed land [2].

De Leon moved to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction and improper venue, arguing that since the complaint stated he resided in Makati and his house was on the land, the property must be in Makati, outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Manila court [2]. The plaintiffs immediately moved to amend the complaint to insert the exact location: "1272 San Andres, Manila" [3]. The Municipal Court granted the amendment and denied the motion to dismiss [3]. De Leon filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance of Manila, claiming the lower court lacked jurisdiction to allow the amendment. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling the amendment only particularized the location [3]. De Leon appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipal Court had jurisdiction to allow the amendment of the complaint to cure the failure to allege the specific location of the property.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. The Court held that the complaint was clearly and admittedly one for illegal detainer, which conferred jurisdiction over the subject matter upon the Municipal Court under Section 88 of the Judiciary Act of 1948 [4].

Since the court had jurisdiction over the action itself, the question of whether the suit was brought in the place where the land is located was merely a matter of venue [4]. Citing *Manila Railroad Co. v. Attorney-General* (20 Phil. 523), the Court explained that in the exercise of its jurisdiction, the court has the power to determine if venue is properly laid [4]. It appeared at the hearing that the land was indeed in Manila and the omission was mere inadvertence; thus, the objection was a pure technicality and the court committed no error in allowing the amendment [4].

The order of the lower court is affirmed.
