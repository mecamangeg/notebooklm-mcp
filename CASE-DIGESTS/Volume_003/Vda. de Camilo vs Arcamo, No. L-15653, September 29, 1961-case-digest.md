I. CAPTION
PETRA CARPIO VDA. DE CAMILO, ET AL. v. THE HON. JUSTICE OF THE PEACE SAMUEL A. ARCAMO, ONG PENG KEE and ADELIA ONG, G.R. No. L-15653, September 29, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Vda. de Camilo and the Franciscos possessed adjoining parcels of public foreshore land in Malangas, Zamboanga del Sur, where they had commercial buildings. On September 1, 1957, their buildings burned down. Respondents Ong Peng Kee and Adelia Ong subsequently constructed a building that encroached upon portions of the lands previously occupied by the petitioners. Petitioners filed separate cases for Forcible Entry against the respondents in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Malangas.

Pending trial, respondents filed a complaint for Interpleader in the same JP Court against petitioners and others, alleging that the defendants had conflicting claims over the possession of the lot and that respondents had no interest other than as lessees. The JP Court denied petitioners' motion to dismiss the Interpleader and dismissed the forcible entry cases. Petitioners filed a petition for Certiorari and Mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zamboanga, which ruled that the JP Court lacked jurisdiction over the interpleader case.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Justice of the Peace Court has jurisdiction to take cognizance of the Interpleader case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CFI's decision, holding that the JP Court lacked jurisdiction for two main reasons.

First, the complaint for Interpleader was improper and without cause of action because the requirements under Section 1, Rule 14 (now Rule 62) were not met. There were no conflicting claims between the petitioners; their claims were separate and distinct regarding the specific portions of their respective lands encroached upon. Furthermore, respondents were not disinterested parties, as their interest was the prolongation of their occupancy [1], [2].

Second, even assuming the complaint was proper, the JP Court had no jurisdiction. The action asking petitioners to interplead regarding the land necessarily involved "title to or possession of real property or any interest therein" and the subject matter was "incapable of pecuniary estimation" (as no rentals were sought). Both falling under the original jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) pursuant to Section 44, paragraphs (a) and (b) of the Judiciary Act [3].

Decision affirmed [4].
