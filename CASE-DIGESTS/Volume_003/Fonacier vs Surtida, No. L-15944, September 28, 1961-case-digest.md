I. CAPTION
ISABELO F. FONACIER v. HON. JOSE T. SURTIDA, in his capacity as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur, JUAN ONG, and FERNANDO GAITE, G.R. No. L-15944, September 28, 1961, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Isabelo F. Fonacier was the defendant in a civil suit for a sum of money filed by respondent Juan Ong, in which Fonacier impleaded respondent Fernando Gaite [1]. The trial court, presided by Judge Surtida, heard the case in Fonacier's absence and rendered judgment against him on January 6, 1959 [2]. Fonacier's counsel received the judgment on February 5, 1959 [2]. On March 4, 1959, Fonacier filed a 22-page "Petition to Set Aside" the judgment, arguing it violated his constitutional right to be heard and was not supported by evidence [2-4]. The trial court denied this petition, and Fonacier received the denial on July 24, 1959 [2, 5]. The following day, he filed his notice of appeal [5]. However, the trial court rejected the appeal and granted the motion for execution, ruling that the "Petition to Set Aside" was a mere *pro forma* motion that did not suspend the 30-day period to perfect an appeal, thus rendering the judgment final [5]. Fonacier filed a petition for mandamus to compel the judge to allow the appeal [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the "Petition to Set Aside" was a *pro forma* motion that failed to suspend the period to perfect the appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the "Petition to Set Aside" was **not** a *pro forma* motion [4]. A motion is not *pro forma* when it specifically alleges valid grounds for reconsideration, such as the judgment being unsupported by evidence. In this case, the petitioner's motion consisted of twenty-two pages and devoted eight pages to specifically demonstrating why the evidence of record did not sustain the judgment and why the claims against him were "absurd" [3, 4]. Because the motion validly attacked the judgment on the ground that it was not supported by evidence, it effectively suspended the running of the regulatory period to appeal [4]. Consequently, the trial court erred in declaring the judgment final.

The petition for mandamus is **GRANTED**, and the respondent judge is required to give due course to the appeal [6].
