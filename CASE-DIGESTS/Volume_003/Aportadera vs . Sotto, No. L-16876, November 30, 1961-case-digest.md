**I. CAPTION**
ABELARDO APORTADERA v. MANUEL C. SOTTO, G.R. No. L-16876, November 30, 1961, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
In the November 1, 1959 general elections for Vice-Governor of Davao, respondent Manuel C. Sotto obtained the majority of votes against petitioner Abelardo Aportadera and was proclaimed elected [1]. Aportadera filed a *quo warranto* proceeding, claiming Sotto was ineligible under Section 2071 of the Revised Administrative Code because he was not a "qualified voter" of Davao at the time of the election [2]. Aportadera alleged that Sotto was a registered voter in Manila and failed to secure a valid transfer or cancellation of said registration before registering in Davao, rendering his Davao registration illegal [3]. Sotto moved to dismiss the petition for lack of cause of action. The Court of First Instance of Davao granted the motion and dismissed the petition [2]. Aportadera appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N registration as a voter is an essential requirement to be considered a "qualified voter" for purposes of eligibility to an elective provincial office.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that registration is not a qualification for eligibility.

The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Yra v. Abaño*, *Vivero v. Murillo*, and *Larena v. Teves* that registration is essential only to the **exercise** of the right of suffrage, not to the **possession** thereof [4]. The right to vote is derived from Article V of the Constitution (citizenship, age, literacy, and residence), and Section 98 of the Revised Election Code cannot be construed as adding registration to these constitutional qualifications without becoming unconstitutional [5, 6].

Therefore, even if Sotto had not been registered in Davao at all, he would still be a "qualified voter" eligible for office provided he met the age and residence requirements prescribed by the Constitution and Section 2071 of the Revised Administrative Code [6]. Additionally, regarding the allegation that Sotto committed a crime by swearing to a false affidavit, the Court ruled that disqualification under Section 99 requires a "final judgment" of conviction, which had not been rendered against him [7].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [7].
