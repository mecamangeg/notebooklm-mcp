I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LUCIO RADA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16988, December 30, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Lucio Rada and two others were charged in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao with robbery in an uninhabited house under Article 302 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) for stealing nine sacks of *palay* valued at P108.00. The accused filed a motion to quash, arguing that the subject matter being *palay*, the crime falls under Article 303 (Robbery of cereals), which carries a lighter penalty (*arresto mayor* minimum and medium) and thus falls within the original jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace or Municipal Court, not the CFI [1-3]. The CFI granted the motion and dismissed the case, ruling that *palay* is a cereal or "*semilla alimenticia*" [3, 4]. The prosecution appealed, contending that *palay* is not necessarily a seedling depending on its intended use [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the robbery of *palay* (unhulled rice) falls under Article 303 of the Revised Penal Code covering "cereals" or "*semilla alimenticia*."

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. The Court held that *palay* is comprehended by the term "cereals" in Article 303 of the RPC [6]. Relying on the Spanish text of the Code which uses "*semilla alimenticia*" (seedling), and citing *People v. Mesias*, the Court explained that *palay* is grain in its original state which, under proper conditions, will germinate into the plant that produces it [5]. This is distinct from hulled rice (*arroz*), which cannot germinate [7]. The Court rejected the Solicitor General's argument regarding the intended use of the grain (agricultural vs. commercial), stating such distinction is not apparent in the law [5]. Consequently, the offense falls under Article 303 and is within the jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace or Municipal Court [8].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [8].
