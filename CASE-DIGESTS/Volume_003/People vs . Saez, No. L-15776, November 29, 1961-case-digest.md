I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ADOLFO SAEZ, G.R. No. L-15776, November 29, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Appellant Adolfo Saez was convicted by the trial court for the killing of Agripino Patrimonio on March 9, 1955. While the case was pending appeal, the defense counsel discovered a sworn statement made by one Roman Catian three days after the crime [1]. This statement, which had been suppressed by the Philippine Constabulary officers, identified Maximo Saez (appellant's brother) as the person who ordered the shooting of intruders, while identifying Adolfo only as one who helped dispose of the body [1, 2]. The trial court had relied on a *subsequent* statement by Catian to convict Adolfo [3, 4]. The Solicitor General investigated the matter, confirmed that the earlier statement implicating Maximo existed and was executed prior to the one used in court, and interposed no objection to a new trial in the interest of justice [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence should be granted.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the motion for new trial should be granted in the interest of justice [4]. The sworn statement relied upon constitutes newly discovered evidence because the defense had no reasonable opportunity to discover its existence before and during the trial [3, 4]. The evidence is material because it might render valueless the subsequent sworn statement upon which the trial court partly relied to convict the appellant, and it points to a person other than the appellant as the mastermind of the crime [4, 7]. Furthermore, the Solicitor General acknowledged that the suppression of this evidence denied the accused the opportunity to fully defend himself [8].

The decision rendered in the case is set aside and the record is remanded to the lower court for a new trial [9].
