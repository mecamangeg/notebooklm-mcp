**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GALBON IJAD and SAKILAN MUSLIM, G.R. No. L-14456, October 31, 1961, Padilla, J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 6, 1957, in Zamboanga City, the family of Aisami Ramain was massacred. Police investigation initially suspected pirates, but Philippine Constabulary Captain Decoroso Santos later apprehended suspect Galbon Ijad. Upon questioning, Ijad admitted to the crime and named Jimlani Abdusalim and Sakilan Muslim as confederates. Ijad led authorities to the house of his brother-in-law, where they recovered the scabbard of Ijad's *barong* and various looted items belonging to the victims [1, 2]. Ijad and Muslim executed written confessions subscribed before Judge Piñga [2, 3].

Jimlani Abdusalim pleaded guilty. Ijad and Muslim pleaded not guilty, repudiating their confessions during trial and alleging they were maltreated and tortured by the PC soldiers to extract the statements [4, 5]. The Court of First Instance of Zamboanga found them guilty of Robbery in Band with Multiple Homicide and sentenced them to death [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the extrajudicial confessions of the accused were voluntarily given.
2. W/N the guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the confessions were voluntary. If the defendants had truly been maltreated, they should have informed their counsel *de oficio* when he first visited them in jail, which they failed to do [7, 8]. Furthermore, Judge Piñga, a disinterested officer, testified that he informed the accused of their constitutional rights and that they never complained of maltreatment when subscribing to the oaths [8, 9]. The Court held that the failure to complain and the inconsistencies in their testimony regarding the signing of the statements indicate the confessions were voluntary and later repudiated only due to remorse [8].

2. **YES.** The recovery of the loot (clothes, blankets, etc.) from the house of Ijad's brother-in-law constitutes strong evidence of guilt [10, 11]. Additionally, the refusal of appellant Muslim to look at the gruesome pictures of the victims and the crime scene during the investigation was viewed by the Court as betraying his guilt [10, 11].

**Disposition:** The judgment is **MODIFIED**. For lack of the necessary votes to impose the death penalty, the sentence is reduced to *reclusion perpetua*. The accused are ordered to return recovered articles and indemnify the heirs for unrecovered items [12].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. Justice Barrera took no part [13].
