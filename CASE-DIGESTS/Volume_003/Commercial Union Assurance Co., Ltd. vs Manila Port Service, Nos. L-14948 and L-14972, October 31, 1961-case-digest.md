I. CAPTION
COMMERCIAL UNION ASSURANCE CO., LTD. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-14948 and L-14972, October 31, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
P. J. Rhodes & Co. shipped 4,000 bags of soybean meal to Manila on board "M.S. Tosima," consigned to San Miguel Brewery. The shipment was discharged from the vessel on May 9, 1956 [1]. Defendant Manila Port Service (MPS), the arrastre operator, failed to deliver 26 bags to the consignee [2]. Plaintiff Commercial Union Assurance Co., Ltd., as insurer, paid the consignee P745.95 for the loss and was subrogated to its rights [2].

On May 25, 1956, the consignee filed a provisional claim for the missing goods [1]. The insurer subsequently filed suit against MPS. MPS argued that the claim was barred by Section 15 of the Management Contract, which requires claims to be filed within 15 days from the discharge of the goods from the carrying vessel [1]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the plaintiff [3]. Both parties appealed; the plaintiff regarding interest and fees, and the defendants on the questions of the contract's binding effect and the timeliness of the claim [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Management Contract is binding on the consignee who is not a party thereto.
2. W/N the claim for loss was filed within the prescriptive period.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Management Contract is binding on the consignee even if they are not a signatory. The Supreme Court held that a consignee becomes bound by the contract when it takes delivery of goods upon presentation of a gate pass and delivery permit which make reference to the Management Contract and substantially reproduce its provisions [5, 6]. By using these documents to demand delivery, the consignee effectively accepts the provisions, including the limitations on liability [7].

2. **NO.** The claim was filed out of time. Section 15 of the Management Contract expressly provides that the contractor is released from liability unless a claim is filed "within fifteen (15) days from the date of discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel" [8]. The Court emphasized that the period runs from the discharge from the vessel, not from the date the consignee actually receives the goods [9]. Since the last bag was discharged on May 9, 1956, and the claim was filed on May 25, 1956, the filing was one day beyond the 15-day limit [1, 9].

**ACCORDINGLY**, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the complaint is **DISMISSED** [10].
