I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PEDRO RACCA, NEPOMUCENO MENDOZA, and LUCIO RAGADI, G.R. No. L-15812, December 30, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of May 10, 1954, Seismunda Lizardo was shot and killed while sleeping in her home in Sta. Maria, Ilocos Sur. Witnesses Gregorio and Eleuterio Directo, the victim’s children, identified appellant Nepomuceno Mendoza by his voice and the light of a flashlight he carried; they heard him ask his companion if the "mark" was hit, to which the companion replied she was hit in the eye. Another witness, Antonio Velasco, later overheard Mendoza bragging about the killing.

Following their arrests, appellants Mendoza, Lucio Ragadi, and Pedro Racca executed extra-judicial confessions. They detailed a conspiracy where Racca, hired by third parties (who were later acquitted) for a reward, engaged Ragadi as the triggerman and Mendoza as the guide. During the trial, the appellants repudiated these confessions, claiming they were extracted through force and maltreatment by the authorities. They also interposed the defense of alibi. The Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur found them guilty of Murder and imposed the death penalty.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the extra-judicial confessions are admissible despite the appellants' claims of maltreatment.
2. W/N the defense of alibi is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court found the extra-judicial declarations to be voluntary. The appellants failed to denounce the alleged maltreatment to the subscribing Judge or their counsel for a long period despite having the opportunity to do so. This inaction "heavily argues against the veracity of their claim" (citing *People v. Ijad*). Furthermore, the confessions contained details that could only be known by the perpetrators and corroborated each other on material points.

2. **NO.** The defense of alibi "vanishes into thin air in the face of positive identification by witnesses." The Court held that alibi must be clear, positive, and convincing. Here, the witnesses positively identified Mendoza, and it was not physically impossible for the appellants to be at the scene of the crime. Discrepancies in witness testimony do not impeach credibility if the principal points reveal truthfulness (citing *People v. Jureidini*).

**Disposition:** The judgment is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Due to the absence of the statutory requirement for the imposition of the supreme penalty, the appellants are sentenced to suffer **life imprisonment**.
