I. CAPTION
MANUEL DIVINAGRACIA v. COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA and DON BOSCO TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC., G.R. No. L-17690, December 28, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Manuel Divinagracia, a carpenter, lost the use of one eye due to an accident while working in a furniture shop operated by Don Bosco Technical Institute (Institute). He filed a claim with the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC), which awarded him P2,909.27 [1]. The Institute contested the WCC's jurisdiction, arguing it was a non-profit, charitable institution, but the WCC ruled that the shop was operated for profit. The Institute appealed to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-16500), but the petition was dismissed, making the WCC decision final [1, 2].

The WCC subsequently issued a writ of execution [3]. The Institute then filed a case with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to annul the WCC decision and writ, arguing lack of jurisdiction and authority to execute. The CFI issued a preliminary injunction against the WCC [3]. Divinagracia filed this petition for prohibition to restrain the CFI, contending it had no jurisdiction to review a final WCC decision [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the WCC's jurisdiction over the Institute is barred by *res judicata*.
2. W/N the WCC has the power to issue writs of execution.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The issue of jurisdiction regarding the nature of the Institute (whether profit or charitable) was invoked at all stages of the original proceedings and overruled [5]. This finding was explicitly assailed in the Institute's previous petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-16500), which was dismissed for lack of merit [5]. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the Commission and the legality of its decision are *res judicata* and no longer subject to review by any court [5].

2. **NO.** The power to issue writs of execution is judicial in nature and cannot be vested in administrative bodies like the WCC [6, 7]. The procedure for enforcement is governed by Section 51 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, which requires a party to file a certified copy of the decision with a court of record, which shall then render a decree or judgment to enforce it [7]. Citing *Pastoral v. WCC* and *Community Sawmill Co. v. WCC*, the Court held that the WCC lacks the judicial power to issue writs of execution [8]. Consequently, the CFI did not err in issuing the injunction against the WCC's writ [9].

The petition is dismissed [10].
