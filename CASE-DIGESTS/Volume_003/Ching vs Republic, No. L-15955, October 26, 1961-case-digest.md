I. CAPTION
IN RE: PETITION FOR NATURALIZATION OF NARCISO CHING v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-15955, October 26, 1961, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Narciso Ching filed a petition for naturalization, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Rizal [1, 2]. The Solicitor General appealed the decision, arguing that Ching failed to allege and prove that he believes in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution [2]. Review of the records showed that Ching's printed petition did not contain the specific assertion that "he believes in the principles of the Philippine Constitution," nor did he make such a declaration during the hearing [3]. Ching's counsel argued that the omission was cured because Ching stated his belief in the "ideals of the Filipino people" during the hearing [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's failure to explicitly allege and prove belief in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution warrants the denial of his naturalization.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the petitioner’s failure to allege and prove this belief is fatal to his application. Under Section 2 of the Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473), an applicant must be of good moral character and believe in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution [2]. Section 7 further requires the petition to contain a declaration that the applicant possesses the qualifications required by the Act [2]. The Court held that stating belief in the "ideals of the Filipino people" does not cure the omission; one who desires to become a Filipino citizen must explicitly declare his allegiance to the Philippine Constitution and its principles [4]. In the absence of such allegations and competent proof, courts may not admit an applicant to Filipino citizenship [4].

The appealed decision is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DENIED** [5].
