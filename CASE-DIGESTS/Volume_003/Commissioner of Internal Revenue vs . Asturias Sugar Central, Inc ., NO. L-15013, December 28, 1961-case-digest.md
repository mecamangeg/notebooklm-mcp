I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. ASTURIAS SUGAR CENTRAL, INC., G.R. No. L-15013, December 28, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding a Supreme Court decision that affirmed the Court of Tax Appeals' award of interest on tax payments refundable to respondent Asturias Sugar Central, Inc. [1, 2]. The CIR argued that the doctrine in *Carcar Electric & Ice Plant Co., Inc. v. Court of Tax Appeals*, which allows for interest on improperly collected taxes, had been superseded by *Court of Tax Appeals v. St. Paul’s Hospital of Iloilo*, which denied such interest [2].

The tax refund arose from the CIR's rejection of Asturias' claim for losses sustained when its sugar central was destroyed in April 1942 [3]. Asturias maintained the loss was compensable under the War Damage Commission Act and the exact amount was only determinable in 1950 upon the final payment from the Philippine War Damage Commission [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is liable for interest on the taxes improperly collected.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court denied the Motion for Reconsideration [1].

The Court ruled that while the government generally is not liable for interest, an exception exists under the *Carcar* and *Collector v. Prieto* doctrines: the Collector of Internal Revenue may be made to answer for interest at the legal rate on taxes improperly collected if the collection was attended with **arbitrariness** [4, 5].

The Court distinguished this from the *St. Paul’s Hospital* case, where no arbitrariness was found [3]. In the present case, the CIR acted arbitrarily in rejecting the respondent's claim regarding the war damage losses, which were clearly compensable and only determinable in 1950 [3]. The assessment complained of was "clearly unjustified," bringing the case within the purview of the *Carcar* doctrine [3].

Motion for reconsideration denied [1].
