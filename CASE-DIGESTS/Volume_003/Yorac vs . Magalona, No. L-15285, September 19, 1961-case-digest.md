I. CAPTION
JOSE M. YORAC v. LUIS F. MAGALONA, G.R. No. L-15285, September 19, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Yorac sought a review of the Court of Appeals (CA) decision which declared Respondent Magalona the elected mayor of Saravia, Negros Occidental for the November 1955 elections [1]. The CA decision had reversed the ruling of the Court of First Instance [1]. After the parties filed their briefs and the case was submitted for decision in March 1960, the term of office for the position expired in December 1959 [2]. On May 16, 1961, Magalona moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing the case was moot [2]. Yorac opposed, contending that the legal issues were novel and that a dismissal would result in "no decision" governing the case, as the perfection of the appeal had vacated the lower court's judgment [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed for being moot despite the filing of briefs and the argument that dismissal would vacate the lower court's judgment.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the appeal should be dismissed. The term of the office in question had already expired, rendering the case moot with no practical value to be gained from a decision on the merits [3, 4]. The Court held that the dismissal of an appeal after briefs are filed rests upon the discretion of the court [4].

Regarding the Petitioner's argument that dismissal would leave the case without a decision, the Court explained that while perfecting an appeal technically vacates the judgment appealed from, dismissing the appeal before the appellate court renders a final decision does not result in the total deletion of the judgment *a quo* [3]. Under Section 2, Rule 52 of the Rules of Court, if an appeal is dismissed, the decision of the lower court shall stand as though no appeal had ever been taken and becomes enforceable [3, 5].

Appeal dismissed [4].
