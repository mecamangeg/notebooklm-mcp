I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, ET AL. and THE FIRST NATIONAL CITY BANK OF NEW YORK, G.R. No. L-16106, December 30, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On September 25, 1957, the Republic of the Philippines filed a complaint for escheat against First National City Bank of New York (appellee) and other banks under Act No. 3936 [1]. The Republic sought to escheat certain "credits" and "deposits" held by the banks in favor of persons known to be dead or unheard from for 10 years or more [1].

The appellee bank sought to exclude cashier’s or manager’s checks, demand drafts, and telegraphic transfer payment orders from the complaint [2]. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila initially ruled that cashier’s/manager’s checks and demand drafts were subject to escheat, while telegraphic transfer payment orders were not [2]. However, upon a motion for reconsideration, the CFI amended its decision, holding that demand drafts also do not come within the purview of Act No. 3936 [2]. The Republic appealed the exclusion of the demand drafts and telegraphic transfer payment orders [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N demand drafts are "credits" or "deposits" subject to escheat under Act No. 3936.
2. W/N telegraphic transfer payment orders are "credits" or "deposits" subject to escheat under Act No. 3936.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A demand draft is a bill of exchange payable on demand [3]. Under Section 127 of the Negotiable Instruments Law (Act No. 2031), a bill of exchange does not operate as an assignment of funds in the hands of the drawee, and the drawee is not liable unless and until he accepts it [4]. To establish liability, the draft must be presented for acceptance or payment [4]. Since the demand drafts in question were never presented for acceptance or payment, the appellee bank never became a debtor of the payee [5]. Consequently, there is no creditor-debtor relationship, and the drafts cannot be considered "credits" subject to escheat [5]. The Court distinguished demand drafts from cashier's or manager's checks, which are primary obligations of the bank accepted in advance by their issuance [5], [6].

2. **YES.** A telegraphic transfer payment order is a transaction for the establishment of a credit [7]. The agreement to remit is a purchase and sale transaction where the purchaser completes the transaction upon making payment [7]. The drawer bank has already paid the value of the order to the appellee bank, and the amounts appear in the books of the appellee bank in the names of the respective payees [8]. If the payees demanded payment, the bank would be obligated to pay them [8]. Therefore, the ownership of the funds belongs to the payees, not the drawer bank, and these amounts represent credits or deposits subject to escheat [8], [9].

**Decision modified.** The telegraphic transfer payment orders are ordered escheated in favor of the Republic [9].
