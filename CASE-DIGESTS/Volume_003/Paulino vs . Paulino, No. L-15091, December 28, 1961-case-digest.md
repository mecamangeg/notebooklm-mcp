I. CAPTION
**GENOVEVA CATALAN PAULINO, assisted by her husband FRANCISCO NIETO vs. PAZ H. PAULINO, assisted by her husband DALMACIO AQUINO, et al.**, G.R. No. L-15091, December 28, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On February 4, 1958, petitioner Genoveva Catalan Paulino filed an action against the legitimate children (respondents) of the late Marcos Paulino, who died on February 5, 1951 [1]. Genoveva claimed she was the "illegitimate (spurious)" child of Marcos and Rustica Catalan, born in 1916 while Marcos was married to Dionisia Hernandez [1]. She sought her share of the inheritance, alleging the respondents fraudulently partitioned the estate in 1953 to her exclusion [1].

Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that Genoveva's action was essentially one to establish filiation and was barred because it was filed after the putative father's death [2]. The trial court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the action to establish filiation was barred [3]. Genoveva appealed, contending that under *Zuzuarregui v. Zuzuarregui*, she only needed to prove her filiation to inherit, regardless of whether she brought an action for recognition during the father's lifetime [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an illegitimate (spurious) child can bring an action to compel recognition and claim inheritance after the death of the putative father.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. The Court held that for an illegitimate spurious child to be entitled to successional rights, filiation must be duly proved [4]. Filiation is established by voluntary or compulsory recognition [5].

The Court clarified that it is necessary to allege that the putative father had acknowledged and recognized the child as such, as this acknowledgment is the basis of the right to inherit [6]. In this case, Genoveva did not allege such voluntary acknowledgment [6]. Consequently, her suit became an action to compel recognition [6]. Under the Civil Code, an action to compel recognition cannot be brought after the death of the putative father [6]. Although the motion to dismiss hypothetically admitted the allegation that she was a spurious child, this admission did not entitle her to inherit absent the essential element of acknowledgment/recognition by the father [6].

The order of the lower court was **AFFIRMED** [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**J.B.L. Reyes, J.**, concurred in the result, noting that the action is barred under Article 137 [7].
