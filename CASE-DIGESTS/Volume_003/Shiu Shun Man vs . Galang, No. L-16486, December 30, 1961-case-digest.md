**I. CAPTION**
SHIU SHUN MAN, alias LOO BON, alias LOO SON BON v. EMILIO L. GALANG, Commissioner of Immigration, G.R. No. L-16486, December 30, 1961, De Leon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Shiu Shun Man, a Chinese citizen, arrived in the Philippines on July 23, 1955, as a temporary visitor. His father, Loo Tek, posted a P10,000.00 cash bond for his admission [1]. Petitioner’s status was later changed to pre-arranged employee, authorized to stay until April 30, 1957 [1]. On April 4, 1957, the Respondent Commissioner of Immigration ordered Petitioner's deportation because he knowingly made a false statement under oath—declaring he was single in his immigration papers when he was actually married with three children [1]. A warrant of deportation was issued, and the Commissioner subsequently ordered the confiscation of the bond because Petitioner failed to leave upon the expiration of his authorized stay [2].

Petitioner filed a case with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to enjoin the deportation and declare the bond confiscation illegal [3]. The CFI ruled in favor of Petitioner, declaring the warrant and confiscation void [4]. Respondent appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N Petitioner is liable for deportation for knowingly making a false statement regarding his civil status.
2. W/N the confiscation of the admission bond was proper despite Petitioner's change of status to pre-arranged employee.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** Under Section 45(f) of Commonwealth Act No. 613 (Immigration Act), as amended, any individual who knowingly makes a false statement under oath in any immigration matter is guilty of an offense and liable for deportation [5]. Petitioner admitted he claimed to be single to "simplify his application," despite being married [5]. This false representation is material because an applicant's civil status influences the discretion of immigration authorities; they are less inclined to admit married aliens due to the tendency of such aliens to eventually bring their families, aggravating population and economic problems [6].

2. **YES.** The principle behind the admission bond is "to control and regulate the admission into, and departure from, the Philippines of aliens applying for temporary admission" (Sec. 40(a), C.A. 613) [7]. The confiscation was proper because Petitioner violated the bond's conditions by extending his stay beyond the authorized period of April 30, 1957 [7]. The change of status from temporary visitor to pre-arranged employee did not alter the temporary nature of his stay [7].

**DISPOSITION:** The decision appealed from is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The writ of prohibition issued by the lower court is dissolved [8].
