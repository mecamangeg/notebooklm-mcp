I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FRANCISCO BAYUBAY and VALENTIN GARINGAN, G.R. No. L-13901, September 19, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On September 24, 1952, between 6:00 and 6:30 p.m., Mrs. Ester Diaz-De la Cruz and her companions were traveling in two trucks in Nueva Vizcaya when they were intercepted by appellants Francisco Bayubay, Valentin Garingan, and a third man (deceased). At gunpoint, the appellants robbed the victims of cash and brought them to a secluded area. Mrs. De la Cruz was shot and killed, while her companions—Esteban Magbitang, Carlito Ostares, and Nemesio Eduardo—sustained serious injuries but survived. The Court of First Instance of Nueva Vizcaya convicted appellants of robbery with homicide and multiple frustrated homicide. The lower court sentenced them to *cadena perpetua* for the death of Mrs. De la Cruz and imposed separate indeterminate penalties for each of the frustrated homicides. Appellants appealed, relying on the defense of alibi supported by military records and witnesses claiming they were detained or on guard duty at the time of the crime.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellants' defense of alibi can overcome positive identification by the prosecution witnesses.
2. W/N separate penalties should be imposed for the homicide and frustrated homicides committed on the occasion of the robbery.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that alibi cannot overcome the strong positive evidence presented by the prosecution identifying the appellants as the malefactors. The victims and other impartial witnesses positively identified them as the perpetrators [1, 2]. Furthermore, the documentary evidence presented to corroborate the alibi (military logbooks) appeared suspicious due to unexplained erasures and alterations, and the witnesses supporting the alibi belonged to the same military outfit as the appellants, casting doubt on their veracity [3-5].

2. **NO.** The lower court erred in imposing multiple penalties. The crime charged and proved is the complex crime of robbery with homicide and multiple frustrated homicide under Article 294, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code. Consequently, the offense must be punished as only one act, regardless of the number of homicides or frustrated homicides committed in conjunction with the robbery [6]. The Court must impose the corresponding penalty in its maximum period [7, 8]. Finding the aggravating circumstances of nighttime and armed men present and not offset by any mitigating circumstance, the proper penalty was death; however, due to the lack of necessary votes, it was commuted to *reclusion perpetua* [9].
