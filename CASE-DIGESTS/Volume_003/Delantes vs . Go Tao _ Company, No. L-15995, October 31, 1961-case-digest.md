I. CAPTION
RUFINO DELANTES v. GO TAO & COMPANY, G.R. No. L-15995, October 31, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Rufino Delantes filed a complaint against defendant Go Tao & Company in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu [1, 2]. The defendant answered and filed a counterclaim for damages [2]. After the plaintiff presented his evidence, the CFI *motu proprio* dismissed the case without prejudice, ruling that the subject matter (a claim for overtime pay) fell under the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), not the regular courts [2, 3]. The CFI relied on earlier rulings in *PAFLU v. Tan* and *Gomez v. North Camarines Lumber Co., Inc.* [3]. The defendant appealed the order of dismissal to the Supreme Court, raising the issue of jurisdiction [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance (regular court) has jurisdiction over a money claim for overtime pay where the employer-employee relationship has terminated and no reinstatement is sought.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the order of dismissal. The Court held that the lower court's reliance on *Gomez* was incorrect as that doctrine had been abandoned in *Price Stabilization Corp. (PRISCO) v. Court of Industrial Relations* [3]. The controlling legal principle is that while the CIR has jurisdiction over claims where the employer-employee relationship exists or reinstatement is sought, **"after the termination of the relationship, if no reinstatement is sought, such claims become mere money claims, and come within the jurisdiction of the regular courts"** [4, 5]. Since the plaintiff was not seeking reinstatement, the claim was cognizable by the CFI. The case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS (if any)
None. Barrera, J. took no part [7].
