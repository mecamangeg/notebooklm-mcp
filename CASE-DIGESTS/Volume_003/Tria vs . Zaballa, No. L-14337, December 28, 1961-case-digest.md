I. CAPTION
AGAPITO TRIA, ANGELA INFANTE, and ABUNDIO LAGANTE v. PEDRO ZABALLA and HON. PASTOR P. REYES, G.R. No. L-14337, December 28, 1961, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In June 1956, respondent Pedro Zaballa approached Abundio Lagante, the original tenant of the landholdings owned by petitioner Agapito Tria. Lagante was sick at the time. In the presence of the landowner Tria, Zaballa asked to cultivate the land. Due to his incapacity to work, Lagante acceded to the request [1]. Zaballa cultivated the land and shared the harvest on a 50-50 basis. Later, Zaballa realized he was not receiving his proper share under the New Tenancy Law and sought assistance from the Agricultural Tenancy Commission [1].

While the Commission was investigating, Lagante filed a case for grave threats against Zaballa, resulting in Zaballa's detention; the case was later dismissed [1]. In November 1956, while Zaballa was in jail, Lagante re-entered the land, harvested the crops, divided the share with Tria, and installed his brother to work the land [2]. The Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) ruled in favor of Zaballa, ordering his reinstatement as the lawful tenant [3]. Petitioners appealed, arguing the arrangement was only a temporary sub-tenancy conditioned on Lagante's illness [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Pedro Zaballa became a permanent tenant entitled to security of tenure, thereby extinguishing the original tenancy of Lagante.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court. The evidence showed that the original tenant, Lagante, ceded the cultivation of the landholdings to Zaballa in the presence of the landowner, Tria, due to Lagante's illness [5, 6]. Crucially, the Court held that in the absence of any express reservation in the agreement that Zaballa's right to work the land would be limited only to the duration of Lagante's illness or for a specific agricultural year, the new tenancy arrangement extinguished the old relationship between the landowner and the original tenant [7, 8].

The incapacity of the original tenant effectively terminated the prior relationship, and a new permanent tenancy relationship arose between Tria and Zaballa [8]. The Court further noted that the petitioners' attempt to eject Zaballa on the theory of "temporary" tenancy appeared to be a retaliation for Zaballa's complaint to the Agricultural Tenancy Commission regarding his proper share [9].

Petition denied; decision affirmed [10].
