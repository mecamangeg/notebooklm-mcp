I. CAPTION
VICENTE TAN v. BELEN DE LEON, EDILBERTO DE LEON, ESTELA DE LEON, PAZ TOPAYA, and F. A. FUENTES, G.R. No. L-15254, September 16, 1961, Natividad, J.

II. FACTS
On October 2, 1958, respondents Belen de Leon, et al. filed a complaint with Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor against petitioner Vicente Tan and Beauty Novelties and Toys Factory for unpaid differential and terminal pay [1]. On December 26, 1958, the Regional Office rendered a decision ordering Tan to pay the respondents P6,718.80 in unpaid overtime, differential, and separation pay, plus attorney's fees [1]. Tan did not appeal, and the decision became final, leading to the issuance of a writ of execution and the levy of sewing machines belonging to Tan's wife [1, 2].

On February 2, 1959, Tan filed a petition for *certiorari* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, seeking to vacate the Regional Office's judgment on the ground of lack of jurisdiction [2]. The CFI granted the writ and set aside the Regional Office's decision, ruling that said office lacked authority to hear such claims [2]. Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A expressly vested the Regional Office with jurisdiction over money claims of laborers [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor has jurisdiction to hear and determine claims for overtime, differential, and terminal pay under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CFI's decision, ruling that the provisions of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A are null and void insofar as they confer judicial power upon regional offices and grant them original and exclusive jurisdiction over money claims of laborers other than those falling under the Workmen's Compensation Law [4].

Citing *Corominas v. Labor Standards Commission* and *Miller v. Mardo*, the Court held that the grant of such jurisdiction was made without authority by Republic Act No. 997 [4, 5]. Since the respondents' claims were for overtime and separation pay—and not compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act—the Regional Office had no authority to hear the case [6]. Furthermore, because the claimants were no longer in the service and did not seek reinstatement, their causes of action were "mere money claims" falling under the jurisdiction of regular courts, not the Court of Industrial Relations [6, 7]. Consequently, the decision rendered by Regional Office No. 3 was void *ab initio* and unenforceable [7].

Judgment affirmed [8].
