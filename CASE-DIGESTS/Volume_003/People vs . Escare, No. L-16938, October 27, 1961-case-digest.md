**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RUDY ESCARE, G.R. No. L-16938, October 27, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Rudy Escare was charged with serious slander in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo. During his arraignment, he initially requested to plead guilty to a lesser offense, but the court denied this due to the fiscal's opposition. Consequently, while assisted by counsel, Escare pleaded guilty to the offense charged, and the court rendered a judgment of conviction on the same day. Three days later, but before the judgment was read to him, Escare filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea and substitute it with a plea of not guilty. He argued that since his offer to plead to a lesser offense was rejected, he realized he would rather risk a trial. The trial court denied the motion. Escare appealed, contending that the withdrawal of a guilty plea before the promulgation of judgment is a matter of right [1-3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the trial court abused its discretion in denying the accused's motion to withdraw his plea of guilty and substitute it with a plea of not guilty.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the substitution of a plea of guilty for that of not guilty is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, not a matter of absolute right for the accused [4, 5].

The Court held that unless there is a clear showing that such discretion has been abused, the appellate court is not justified in interfering with the trial court's ruling. The Court cited *U.S. v. Neri* and *People v. Nueno*, reiterating that where an accused is assisted by counsel and aware of the consequences of their plea, the refusal to allow a change of plea is not an abuse of discretion. In this case, Escare was assisted by counsel when the information was read to him, ensuring he was informed of the nature of the charge. His reason for wanting to change his plea—merely because his desire to plead to a lesser offense was denied—was deemed insubstantial [4-6].

The order and decision appealed from are affirmed [6].
