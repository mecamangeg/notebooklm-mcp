**I. CAPTION**
EULOGIO RODRIGUEZ, SR. v. HON. JUDGE WENCESLAO L. FERNAN, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-15143, November 29, 1961, 3 SCRA 486, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Ceferino de los Santos, Jr. filed a civil action in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo against Ricardo Yap Ladrido and Petitioner Eulogio Rodriguez, Sr. involving election issues and damages exceeding P500,000 [1, 2]. Petitioner moved to dismiss based on jurisdiction and failure to state a cause of action, and later on mootness after the election passed, but the court denied dismissal due to the remaining claim for damages [3].

Petitioner subsequently moved to dismiss because the plaintiff had not paid the full docket fees [4]. The court reassessed the fees at P485.00 [4]. Instead of paying the increased amount, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint reducing the claim for damages to P70,000 [4]. Petitioner objected, arguing the case should be dismissed for non-payment of the original fees, but the respondent Judge admitted the amended complaint [4, 5]. Petitioner then filed this action for prohibition [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the respondent Judge properly admitted the amended complaint despite the non-payment of the full docket fees for the original complaint.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that at the time the amended complaint was filed and submitted for admission, the defendant (Petitioner) had not yet filed his answer [5]. Under Section 1, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court, the plaintiff may amend his complaint "as a matter of course" before an answer is filed [5]. Furthermore, the trial court had jurisdiction to allow or disallow amendments, and any error committed in this regard would constitute a mere error of judgment which is correctable by appeal, not by a writ of prohibition [6, 7].

The writ is **DENIED**.
