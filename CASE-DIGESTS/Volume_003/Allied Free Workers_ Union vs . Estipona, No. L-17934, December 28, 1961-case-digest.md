**I. CAPTION**
ALLIED FREE WORKERS’ UNION, (PLUM) ET AL. v. HON. JUDGE MANUEL ESTIPONA, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-17934, December 28, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
On November 5, 1960, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Lanao del Norte rendered a decision in Civil Case No. 577 declaring the arrastre contract between Compañia Maritima and Allied Free Workers’ Union terminated, ordering the Union to pay P520,000.00 in damages, and permanently enjoining the Union from enforcing the contract. The Union filed a motion for reconsideration. While this motion was pending, Compañia Maritima filed an urgent motion for execution pending appeal. Due to the absence of the District Judge presiding over the CFI, the motion was submitted to respondent Municipal Judge of Iligan City (the provincial capital) pursuant to the Judiciary Act. The Municipal Judge granted the motion and issued an order of execution. The Union challenged the order, arguing the Municipal Court lacked jurisdiction.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Municipal Judge has jurisdiction to issue an order of execution in the absence of the District Judge.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the jurisdiction exercised by the Justice of the Peace or Municipal Judge of the provincial capital in the absence of the District Judge under Section 88 of the Judiciary Act of 1948 is merely "interlocutory." This jurisdiction extends only to orders that are not final in character and do not involve a decision on the merits, such as appointments of receivers or temporary injunctions.

The Court ruled that an order of execution is not merely interlocutory but **final** in character because its purpose is to enforce a decision on the merits rendered in the main case. A final order is one that disposes of the pending action or puts an end to the litigation. Consequently, the issuance of a writ of execution is beyond the interlocutory jurisdiction of the Municipal Judge acting as a Judge of First Instance. Furthermore, the order was legally ineffective because it failed to state the "special reasons" required by Rule 39, Section 2 of the Rules of Court for execution pending appeal.

Petition granted; the orders and writ of execution issued by the respondent Municipal Judge are set aside.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
