**I. CAPTION**
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA vs. MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-16573, November 29, 1961, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
Insurance Company of North America (plaintiff), as insurer of a shipment of evaporated milk, filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against Manila Port Service (arrastre operator) and its principal, Manila Railroad Company. The complaint sought recovery of P224.99 for damaged and short-delivered cases of milk unloaded from the SS "President Tyler" into the defendants' custody [1, 2]. Defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that the claim of P224.99 fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Municipal Court and did not involve admiralty [3]. The CFI ruled that the case involved admiralty jurisdiction and ordered defendants to pay the claim. Defendants appealed directly to the Supreme Court on the issue of jurisdiction [1, 4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the functions of an arrastre operator are maritime in nature, thereby bringing an action against it within the admiralty jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that the arrastre operator’s services are not maritime in nature. Relying on the doctrine in *Macondray & Co., Inc. v. Delgado Brothers, Inc.*, the Court explained that the functions of an arrastre operator—receiving, handling, caring for, and delivering merchandise on wharves and piers—are akin to those of a depositary or warehouseman [5, 6]. These functions do not relate to the trade and business of navigation or the operation of vessels [6]. The determination of liability for loss or damage to goods in the custody of the arrastre operator does not require the application of maritime law [5, 7]. Consequently, the CFI had no jurisdiction over the case, as the subject matter was not admiralty and the amount involved (P224.99) was below its jurisdictional threshold [3, 8].

The decision appealed from is reversed and set aside [9].
