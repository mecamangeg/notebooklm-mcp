I. CAPTION
GEORGE MCENTEE v. PERPETUA MANOTOK, G.R. No. L-14968, October 27, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff George McEntee filed an action to recover possession of a parcel of land in Los Baños, Laguna, covered by Original Certificate of Title No. P-56 issued through a free patent. Defendant Perpetua Manotok occupied a portion of the land, alleging that McEntee’s patent was obtained through fraud. During the hearing scheduled for September 8, 1955, McEntee's counsel, Atty. Aldana, failed to appear but filed an urgent petition for transfer, citing serious illness which made travel physically impossible. The petition was unverified and lacked a medical certificate. The trial court denied the motion for continuance, allowed the defendant to present evidence *ex parte*, and subsequently dismissed the complaint for failure to prosecute. McEntee moved for reconsideration and a new trial, explaining the lack of a medical certificate was due to the suddenness of the illness and inability to contact a physician in time, but the motion was denied.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the motion for postponement due to the counsel's illness and dismissing the complaint.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court abused its discretion. In considering motions for postponement or new trial, two circumstances must be weighed: (1) the merits of the movant's case, and (2) the reasonableness of the postponement, such as accident or excusable neglect [1].

First, regarding reasonableness, the sudden illness of counsel constitutes an "accident" that prevented appearance. While the rules generally require a medical certificate, the Court ruled that accidents or sudden illness cannot always be subject to a certificate immediately; strict technical compliance should not be demanded when circumstances render it impossible to secure one in time [2]. Furthermore, this was the plaintiff's first request for postponement, whereas the defendant had previously been granted one [3].

Second, regarding the merits, the plaintiff possesses a Torrens title over the land. To dismiss the case without allowing him to present his side regarding the validity of his title would cause a clear injustice and deprive him of property rights based on technicalities [4]. The Court emphasized that rules of procedure should not be applied in a rigid, technical sense but should be used to help secure substantial justice (Rule 1, Sec. 2, Rules of Court) [5].

The decision and proceedings were set aside, and the case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.
