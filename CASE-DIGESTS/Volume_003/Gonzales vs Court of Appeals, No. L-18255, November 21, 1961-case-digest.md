I. CAPTION
JOSE T. GONZALES v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and JAIME M. FLORES, G.R. No. L-18255, November 21, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Gonzales and private respondent Flores were candidates for Vice-Mayor of Butuan City in the November 10, 1959 elections [1]. Flores was proclaimed the winner, but Gonzales filed an election protest with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan [1]. The CFI rendered a decision declaring Gonzales the duly elected Vice-Mayor [2].

Flores filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA) on questions of fact and law [2]. Gonzales moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing that Section 178 of the Revised Election Code does not authorize appeals for election contests involving the position of Vice-Mayor [3]. The CA denied the motion to dismiss [3]. Gonzales filed a petition for review by certiorari with the Supreme Court, arguing the CA lacked jurisdiction [4]. Flores contended that the omission of Vice-Mayors in the law was a legislative oversight and that the term "city councilors" in the law should embrace Vice-Mayors [5, 6]. Flores also raised the procedural defense that Gonzales failed to file a motion for reconsideration before seeking certiorari [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the decision of the CFI in an election contest for City Vice-Mayor is appealable to the Court of Appeals.
2. W/N the petition for certiorari lies despite the petitioner's failure to file a motion for reconsideration with the CA.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The right to appeal is merely a statutory right and may only be taken when the law so provides [3]. **Section 178 of the Revised Election Code** expressly allows appeals only in contests for provincial governors, members of the provincial board, city councilors, and mayors [8]. It does not include **City Vice-Mayors** [5]. The Court held that this "hiatus" in the law is not a mere oversight but a result of legislative inaction, which can only be cured by legislative enactment, not judicial pronouncement [5]. Furthermore, Vice-Mayors cannot be considered "city councilors" for the purpose of appeal because they possess duties and prerogatives distinct from councilors [6]. Since Flores appealed on mixed questions of fact and law, and no statutory authority grants the CA jurisdiction over Vice-Mayor contests, the appeal cannot prosper [9].

2. **YES.** While a motion for reconsideration is generally a prerequisite for certiorari, it is not necessary when the questions raised have already been passed upon by the lower court [7]. The issue of jurisdiction was squarely raised in Gonzales' motion to dismiss and decided by the CA [7]. Moreover, the CA acted completely without appellate jurisdiction, and not even the agreement of the parties could cure such a jurisdictional defect [7].

**Petition granted. The resolution of the Court of Appeals is SET ASIDE, and the appeal is DISMISSED.** [10]
