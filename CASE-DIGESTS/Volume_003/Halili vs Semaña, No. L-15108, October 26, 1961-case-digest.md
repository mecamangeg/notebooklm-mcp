I. CAPTION
FORTUNATO F. HALILI v. ELEUTERIO SEMAÑA, G.R. No. L-15108, October 26, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Eleuterio Semaña applied with the Public Service Commission (PSC) for a certificate of public convenience to operate four TPU buses on the line between Blumentritt, Manila and Novaliches, Quezon City [1]. Petitioner Fortunato F. Halili, an existing operator on said route, opposed the application, alleging that his current service was sufficient and that he was already incurring financial losses [2, 3]. Semaña presented witnesses and a PSC agent report showing that Halili's buses were often overcrowded (78% load) and insufficient to accommodate residents [2]. Halili presented counter-evidence, including a different PSC agent report showing a load of only 30% [3]. The PSC granted the application, finding that public necessity demanded the service [4]. Halili appealed the decision to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission erred in granting the certificate of public convenience to Semaña based on the finding of public necessity.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the decision, holding that the conflicting evidence could be reconciled to support the grant [4]. The Court reasoned that while Halili’s buses might start their trips from distant terminals (e.g., Bagumbong or Divisoria) with available seats, they likely fill up before reaching the specific contested points of Novaliches or Blumentritt, leaving passengers there without transportation [4]. The Court found the PSC agent reports relied upon by Halili to be inconclusive, as buses could be full between checkpoints due to passengers alighting and boarding [5]. Furthermore, the Court ruled that the financial losses incurred by the petitioner are not proof that additional service is not needed at the specific terminals in question [5]. Adhering to the principle that PSC findings supported by the weight of evidence should not be disturbed, the Court upheld the certificate [6, 7].

The decision of the Public Service Commission is affirmed [7].
