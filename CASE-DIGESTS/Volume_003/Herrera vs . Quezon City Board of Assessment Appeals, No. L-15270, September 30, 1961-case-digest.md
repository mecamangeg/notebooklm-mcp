I. CAPTION
JOSE V. HERRERA and ESTER OCHANGCO HERRERA v. THE QUEZON CITY BOARD OF ASSESSMENT APPEALS, G.R. No. L-15270, September 30, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Jose and Ester Herrera were authorized to operate St. Catherine's Hospital in Quezon City. In 1953, the Quezon City Assessor granted the hospital tax exemption for real property tax on the ground that it was established for charitable purposes [1]. However, in 1955, the Assessor reclassified the properties as taxable effective 1956 [2]. The hospital contained 32 beds, 20 of which were for charity patients and 12 for pay-patients, with income from the latter devoted to improving the charity wards [3, 4]. Additionally, St. Catherine's School of Midwifery, with about 200 students, operated within the hospital premises [5].

Petitioners appealed the assessment to the Quezon City Board of Assessment Appeals, which affirmed the Assessor’s decision. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) subsequently affirmed the Board's decision, ruling that the properties were subject to tax, partly due to the belief that the hospital and the midwifery school derived substantial profits [2, 6, 7]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the hospital, the midwifery school, and its incidental facilities are exempt from real property tax despite the admission of pay-patients and the existence of a midwifery school.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the properties are exempt from taxation.

Regarding the hospital, the admission of pay-patients does not detract from its charitable character because the funds derived from them are devoted exclusively to the maintenance of the institution as a public charity [4]. The Court cited the principle that where rendering charity is the primary object, the mere fact that a profit is made will not deprive the hospital of its benevolent character (*Prairie Du Chien Sanitarium Co. v. City of Prairie Du Chien*) [4].

Regarding the School of Midwifery, the Court held that the fact that substantial profits might be derived from its operation is immaterial to the issue of real estate tax. Under the Constitution, "all lands, buildings and improvements used exclusively for religious, charitable or educational purposes shall be exempt from taxation," regardless of whether material profits are derived from the operation [7]. While Congress may impose taxes on the "profits" (income), the "lands, buildings and improvements" themselves are beyond its taxing power [7].

Furthermore, the exemption extends to facilities "incidental to and reasonably necessary for" the charitable or educational purpose [8]. Thus, the garage used for the school's transportation and the residence of the directress within the building do not affect the charitable character of the institution [9].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals and the Board of Assessment Appeals is **REVERSED** and **SET ASIDE** [10].
