I. CAPTION
IN RE: CORRECTION OF ENTRIES IN THE LOCAL CIVIL REGISTRY OF QUEZON CITY. ANACLETA BARILLO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-14823, December 28, 1961, 3 SCRA 725, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On July 24, 1958, Anacleta Barillo filed a verified petition in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Quezon City, seeking to correct the birth certificates of her four children. She claimed that while her true name is Anacleta, she was known by the nickname "Etang," which led to her name being erroneously recorded as "Vicenta" in the civil registry [1]. She prayed that "Vicenta" be changed to "Anacleta."

The Solicitor General moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that the error was not clerical and involved the identity of her husband, a Chinese national [1]. The lower court dismissed the petition on the ground that the correction sought was substantial and not within the purview of Article 412 of the Civil Code [1]. Barillo appealed the dismissal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the correction of the mother's name from "Vicenta" to "Anacleta" in the civil registry is a mere clerical error that may be corrected via summary proceedings under Article 412 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the error sought to be corrected and its implications are substantial and cannot be remedied by summary proceedings under Article 412 of the Civil Code [2].

The Court reasoned that the correction would necessarily affect the identity of both the mother and the father. The father's name in the birth certificates appeared as "Tomas Gan," while the petitioner claimed her husband was "Ngan Hu" [2]. Although the petitioner alleged these referred to the same person, such a fact must be established in an appropriate proceeding, not in a summary one [2]. Citing *Ansaldo v. Republic* and *Ty Kong Tin v. Republic*, the Court reiterated that Article 412 only contemplates "harmless and innocuous changes of a name that is clearly misspelled" [3], [2].

The Order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [4].
