I. CAPTION
**H. G. HENARES & SONS, petitioner, vs. NATIONAL LABOR UNION, respondent.**, G.R. No. L-17535, December 28, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Pablo Fernandez, a laboratory assistant for H.G. Henares & Sons, arranged to exchange shifts with a co-worker, Francisco Frio, without prior company approval [1]. This arrangement was made to enable Fernandez to testify against the company in an unfair labor practice case pending before the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [1]. Although Frio agreed and worked the shift, the company discovered the unauthorized exchange due to alleged poor work quality [2]. Consequently, Frio was suspended, but Fernandez was dismissed from employment [2]. The CIR found the company guilty of unfair labor practice, declaring the dismissal discriminatory and ordering Fernandez's reinstatement with back wages [3]. The company petitioned for review, arguing the dismissal was a valid disciplinary action for the unauthorized shift change [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the employee for an unauthorized shift exchange to testify against the employer constitutes unfair labor practice.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR decision, ruling that the dismissal was discriminatory and motivated by the employee's union activities [4, 5]. The Court held that the unauthorized shift exchange was a "trivial infraction" that did not warrant the severe penalty of discharge, particularly because Fernandez had secured a replacement to ensure the company's operations were not impaired [4]. The evidence showed the dismissal was actually retaliatory because Fernandez, a union board member, testified unfavorably against the company in a pending legal case [5]. Citing the rule that CIR findings are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence, the Court upheld the order for reinstatement and back wages [6].

**Petition denied. Decision affirmed.**
