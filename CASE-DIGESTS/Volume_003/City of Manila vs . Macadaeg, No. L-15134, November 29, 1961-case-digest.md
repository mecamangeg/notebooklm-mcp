I. CAPTION
THE CITY OF MANILA v. HON. HIGINO B. MACADAEG, Judge, Court of First Instance of Manila, ANTONIO AVECILLA, LUCIO R. ILDEFONSO and PABLO V. GUTIERREZ, G.R. No. L-15134, November 29, 1961, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In a condemnation proceeding instituted by the City of Manila, respondent Judge Higino B. Macadaeg appointed three commissioners to determine the value of the property [1]. After submitting their report, the commissioners filed a motion for compensation at P100.00 per meeting [1]. The City Fiscal opposed the motion, citing the Rules of Court which fixed such compensation at P4.00 per day [1]. The trial court issued an order fixing the compensation, which the City of Manila failed to appeal within the reglementary period [2]. After the order became final, the City of Manila filed a petition for certiorari to revoke the order, arguing against the compensation amount [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a writ of certiorari may be issued to revise an order after the time to appeal has elapsed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the petition [3]. The Court held that certiorari may not be used to obtain a revision of an order after the time to appeal has elapsed [4, 5]. While petitions to revoke orders or decisions may be entertained even after the appeal period has passed, this is only applicable in cases where the jurisdiction of the court had been exceeded [5]. Since the City of Manila failed to appeal the order fixing the commissioners' fees on time, allowing it to become final, it cannot utilize certiorari as a substitute for the lost appeal [2]. The petition was denied [3].
