I. CAPTION
RODOLFO B. SANTIAGO v. AMADO DIMAYUGA, G.R. No. L-17883, December 30, 1961, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
Rodolfo Santiago filed a complaint against Amado Dimayuga for the collection of money based on five promissory notes for automobile installments and a claim for repairs. The notes stipulated that in the event of judicial proceedings to enforce collection, Dimayuga would pay an additional 33-1/3% of the amount due as attorney’s fees [1, 2]. During the proceedings, the parties submitted a partial amicable settlement where Dimayuga admitted liability for the principal amount of P42,789.23 and repair costs, leaving the determination of attorney’s fees to the trial court's discretion [3]. The trial court rendered judgment ordering Dimayuga to pay the amounts admitted and reduced the attorney's fees to 20% of the principal [4]. Dimayuga appealed, arguing that the stipulation on attorney's fees was inapplicable because the suit was supposedly just to settle a disagreement on payment application, not to enforce collection [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the stipulation on attorney’s fees in the promissory notes is applicable to the case.
2. W/N the trial court acted correctly in reducing the attorney's fees to 20%.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The stipulation applies because the complaint was clearly for the collection or recovery of money. The purpose of an action is determined by the complaint itself, its allegations, and the prayer for relief [6]. A stipulation regarding the payment of attorney’s fees is neither illegal nor immoral and is enforceable as the law between the parties (*Luneta Motor vs. Mora Limponco*) [7].

2. **YES.** The reduction was proper. Attorney’s fees stipulated in a contract are in the nature of liquidated damages (Art. 2216, New Civil Code), which do not require proof of pecuniary loss [7]. However, under Article 1229 of the New Civil Code, the judge shall equitably reduce the penalty when the principal obligation has been partly complied with [8]. Since the defendant made installment payments prior to the suit and the case was partially settled by compromise, it was just and fair for the court to exercise its discretion to reduce the fees from 33-1/3% to 20% [8].

Decision affirmed [9].
