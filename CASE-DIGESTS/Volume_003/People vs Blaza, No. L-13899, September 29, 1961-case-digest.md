I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PABLO BLAZA and FRANCISCO MANGULABNAN, G.R. No. L-13899, September 29, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On April 23, 1953, in Pagsanjan, Laguna, an armed band led by Lope Cunanan (alias Captain Mendoza) forcibly took Dorotea, Fe, and Buenaventura Fernandez from their home [1, 2]. The victims were detained in the mountains until May 8, 1953, when they were released after paying a P40,000 ransom [3, 4]. Witnesses identified appellant Francisco Mangulabnan as a guard of the victims and present during the counting of the ransom money [5]. Mangulabnan was charged with kidnapping for ransom in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Laguna [1]. He filed a motion to quash based on double jeopardy, arguing he was already charged in CFI Pampanga with rebellion complexed with kidnapping, and the Laguna kidnapping was committed in furtherance of that rebellion [6]. The trial court denied the motion [7]. During trial, Mangulabnan’s *counsel de parte* failed to appear despite notice, engaging in dilatory tactics; consequently, the court appointed *counsel de oficio* and proceeded with the trial [8, 9]. The CFI convicted Mangulabnan and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* [10]. He appealed, alleging denial of his right to have his own counsel and double jeopardy [11, 12].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in proceeding with the trial in the absence of the appellant's *counsel de parte*.
2. W/N the prosecution for kidnapping constitutes double jeopardy given the appellant's conviction for rebellion.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that when a detained defendant's *counsel de parte* fails to appear without justifiable cause, the court may appoint *counsel de oficio* and proceed to ensure the defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial [13, 14]. The record showed the appellant's counsel employed dilatory tactics, and the appointed *counsel de oficio* sufficiently safeguarded the appellant’s rights during the proceedings [11, 15, 16].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled there was no double jeopardy because the information for rebellion filed in CFI Pampanga did not allege the specific kidnapping of the Fernandez family as an overt act [17]. Likewise, the information in the present case charged kidnapping with ransom under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code without alleging it was a means to commit rebellion [18]. Since the specific act was not included in the rebellion charge, the appellant was never in jeopardy for this offense in the previous case [17, 19].

The judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED [20].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
