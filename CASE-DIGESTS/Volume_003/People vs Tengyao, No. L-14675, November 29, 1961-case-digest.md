I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AGUSTIN TENGYAO, G.R. No. L-14675, November 29, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On February 17, 1956, accused-appellant Agustin Tengyao, a provincial guard in Bontoc, Mountain Province, was guarding prisoner Villamor Pagarigan who was cutting grass [1], [2]. Pagarigan asked permission to defecate but disappeared from sight [2]. Tengyao tracked Pagarigan’s footprints, saw him running away, and fired a warning shot [2]. When Pagarigan refused to stop, Tengyao shot him in the leg from about four meters away [2]. As Pagarigan attempted to jump to a lower rice paddy, Tengyao shot him in the back, killing him [2]. Tengyao claimed he acted in fulfillment of duty and under uncontrollable fear of imprisonment should the prisoner escape [3]. The Court of First Instance of Bontoc convicted him of Murder and sentenced him to *reclusión perpetua* [1], [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused is exempt from criminal liability based on fulfillment of duty or uncontrollable fear.
2. W/N the crime committed is Murder attended by treachery.
3. W/N the mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction should be appreciated.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The killing was unjustified [5]. Although it was Tengyao's duty to prevent the escape, the necessity to kill ceased after he wounded Pagarigan in the leg [5]. The wound would have caused the victim to limp, making recapture easy, especially since the victim was running toward a steep cliff [5]. Consequently, the claim of uncontrollable fear of equal or greater injury (imprisonment) was unwarranted because the escape was already effectively thwarted [6].

2. **NO.** The crime is Homicide, not Murder [7]. Treachery cannot be appreciated even if the fatal shot was fired at the victim's back because the shots were fired in succession during a pursuit [8]. The appellant did not consciously employ means to insure execution without risk to himself [8]. The Court appreciated two mitigating circumstances: voluntary surrender and lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong, as Tengyao only intended to stop the escape [9], [8].

3. **NO.** Illiteracy alone is insufficient to invoke the mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction; it must be accompanied by a lack of sufficient intelligence [9].

**Disposition:** The judgment is **MODIFIED**. The accused is found guilty of Homicide and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 6 months and 1 day of *prisión correccional* to 8 years and 1 day of *prisión mayor* [7], [10].
