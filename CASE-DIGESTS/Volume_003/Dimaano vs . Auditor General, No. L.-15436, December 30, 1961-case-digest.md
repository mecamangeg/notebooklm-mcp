I. CAPTION
EUSEBIO G. DIMAANO v. THE AUDITOR GENERAL and THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-15436, December 30, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Eusebio G. Dimaano retired on January 16, 1953, under the compulsory retirement provisions of Commonwealth Act (C.A.) No. 186, as amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 660. The GSIS awarded him a lump sum annuity for the first five years but deducted P990.00 representing his required contributions to the retirement fund for five years [1, 2]. Dimaano demanded a refund, arguing that under R.A. No. 660, the law in force at his retirement, the requirement to make contributions for at least five years appeared only in Section 12(a) regarding optional retirement, and not in Section 12(c) regarding compulsory retirement [3, 4]. He further cited the ruling in *Bautista v. Auditor General* to support his claim that deductions were illegal [1]. The Auditor General affirmed the GSIS General Manager's decision to deny the refund, prompting this petition for review [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the GSIS may deduct the amount equivalent to five years of contributions from the annuity of a retiree who retired under the compulsory retirement plan.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the condition in Section 12(a) of C.A. No. 186, as amended, requiring members to have "made contributions for at least five years," constitutes a general condition precedent for retirement benefits that applies "in all cases," whether the retirement is optional or compulsory [6, 7]. Relying on *Espejo v. Auditor General*, the Court explained that R.A. No. 660 established a retirement system funded by premiums; thus, to meet obligations, every retiree must have contributed to the fund for at least five years [7]. If a retiree has not yet contributed for that duration upon retirement, the Board of Trustees is authorized to deduct the necessary amount from their annuity [7]. The Court clarified that *Bautista v. Auditor General* did not abandon the *Espejo* doctrine, as *Bautista* involved the discounting of interest from lump sums, not the payment of mandatory premium contributions [8].

The decision of the Auditor General is affirmed.
