I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DOROTEO BOLLENA, GREGORIO VALIDA, CRESENCIO CABERO and TANSO URABE, G.R. No. L-13415, December 30, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On March 2, 1957, at midnight in Mayorga, Leyte, 85-year-old Lucia Varona and her 12-year-old granddaughter, Maxima Bohol, discovered intruders in their kitchen. Appellants Doroteo Bollena and Gregorio Valida entered; Bollena stabbed Lucia and dropped her repeatedly on the floor, resulting in her death. They took a trunk and passed it to Tanso Urabe and Cresencio Cabero, who were acting as lookouts and illumination outside. Maxima witnessed the events and identified the four accused, whom she knew personally. The trial court convicted all four of Robbery in Band with Homicide and sentenced them to death. The accused appealed, raising the defense of alibi and questioning Maxima's credibility, alleging she testified falsely due to a grudge against Valida for previously disciplining her.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the identification by the 12-year-old witness was credible sufficient to overcome the defense of alibi.
2. W/N conspiracy existed among the accused.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court found the identification credible. It held that it is "hardly credible" that a 12-year-old girl would harbor a grudge deep enough to implicate the accused in a serious crime merely because she was once whipped for picking coconuts [1]. Minor inconsistencies in her testimony regarding details only rendered her more believable, precluding the possibility of coaching [1]. Positive identification by a witness who knows the accused prevails over the defense of alibi [2].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that conspiracy existed as it may be deduced from the individual acts of the accused showing a unity of purpose [3]. In this case, their acts of arriving together, one killing the victim, and others carting away the loot and guarding, clearly revealed a community of purpose [4].

The judgment of the lower court is **MODIFIED**. Due to the lack of sufficient votes to impose the death penalty, the sentence is reduced to **life imprisonment** [5].
