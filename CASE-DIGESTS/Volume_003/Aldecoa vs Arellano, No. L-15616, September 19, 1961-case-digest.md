**I. CAPTION**
LOURDES ALDECOA, BARBARA ZAMORA, and AUGUSTO E. SALAZAR v. THE HON. FRANCISCO ARELLANO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, Branch I, and PEDRO G. SIGUENZA, G.R. No. L-15616, September 19, 1961, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
On March 25, 1958, the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental rendered a decision ordering petitioners Aldecoa et al. to pay respondent Pedro Siguenza P7,500.00 plus attorney's fees [1]. Attempts to personally serve the decision on petitioners' counsel, Atty. Jose Macasa, and his brother on March 29, 1958, failed as both refused receipt [2]. Consequently, a copy was sent by registered mail, and the first registry notice was sent to counsel on March 31, 1958 [2]. Counsel failed to claim the letter, prompting second and third notices on April 7 and April 17, respectively [2]. The letter was eventually claimed by counsel's brother on April 26, 1958 [2]. On May 8, Siguenza moved for execution, and on May 19, 1958, petitioners filed their notice of appeal, appeal bond, and record on appeal [3]. The trial court granted execution and dismissed the appeal for being filed out of time [3]. Petitioners filed a petition for mandamus with the Court of Appeals, which was dismissed after the court found that the registry notices were validly delivered to a person residing in counsel's house [4, 5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioners' appeal was perfected within the reglementary period.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts, ruling that the period to appeal began to run five (5) days after March 31, 1958, the date the first registry notice was sent to petitioners' counsel [6, 7]. Under the rules on service by registered mail, if the addressee fails to claim the mail, service is deemed complete upon the expiration of five days from the date of the first notice [7]. The Court upheld the factual finding that the postman had delivered the notices to a person residing in the counsel's house who had been receiving his mail for over a year [5]. Consequently, the filing of the appeal requirements on May 19, 1958, was made more than 30 days after the period to appeal commenced, rendering it beyond the reglementary period [8].

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
