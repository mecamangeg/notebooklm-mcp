I. CAPTION
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. MANILA PORT SERVICE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17331, November 29, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On May 21, 1957, C. Itch & Co., Ltd. shipped a set of welding machine parts from Yokohama to Manila aboard the "Canada Mail," consigned to Roxas-Kalaw Textile Mills, Inc. The shipment was insured by the plaintiff, Insurance Company of North America. Upon arrival in Manila on May 28, 1957, the Manila Port Service (MPS), the arrastre operator, delivered the cargo to the consignee short of one case valued at P1,608.05.

The plaintiff paid the insurance claim to the consignee and, as subrogee, filed a suit against MPS for recovery of the sum. MPS admitted its custody of the cargo but denied liability, arguing that under the Management Contract between MPS and the Bureau of Customs, a claim must be filed within 15 days from the discharge of goods, which the plaintiff failed to do. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of the plaintiff, holding that the Management Contract was not binding on the consignee who was not a party to it. MPS appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Management Contract is binding on the consignee and insurer even if they were not signatories to it.
2. W/N the failure to file a claim within the 15-day period prescribed in the Management Contract bars the plaintiff’s action for recovery.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Management Contract is binding on the consignee. Even if the consignee was not a signatory, it legally became a party to the contract when it obtained the delivery permit and gate pass through its broker [1]. These documents reproduced the pertinent stipulations of the Management Contract, and by making use of them to demand delivery of the shipment, the consignee is bound by its terms [2].

2. **YES.** The filing of a claim within 15 days is a condition precedent to liability. The requirement is not an empty formalism but is intended to afford the arrastre operator a reasonable opportunity to check the validity of claims while facts are fresh [3]. Although the suit was filed within one year, the failure to file the provisional claim within 15 days from the discharge of the goods relieves the MPS of liability [3, 4].

Decision reversed.
