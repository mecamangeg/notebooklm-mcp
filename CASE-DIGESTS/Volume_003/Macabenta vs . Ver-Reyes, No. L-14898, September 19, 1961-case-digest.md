I. CAPTION
MARIA MACABENTA, petitioner-appellee, vs. EMMA H. VER-REYES, ET AL., respondents. EMMA H. VER-REYES, respondent-appellant, G.R. No. L-14898, September 19, 1961, 3 SCRA 63, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Ver-Reyes filed an action for unlawful detainer against Maria Macabenta and Maximo Umali in the Municipal Court of Manila regarding a property in Sampaloc, Manila [1]. The Municipal Court rendered a decision ordering Macabenta to pay rentals in arrears and a monthly sum "up to the time she finally vacates the place," but did not explicitly state in the dispositive portion that the defendants must vacate the premises [2]. When the decision became executory, the Municipal Court issued a writ of execution commanding the sheriff to cause the defendants to "remove the said premises" and for plaintiffs to have restitution of the same [3].

Macabenta filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, arguing that the writ materially varied from the decision [4]. The CFI granted the petition, ruling that there was a clear variance because the judgment did not expressly order the defendants to vacate [5]. Ver-Reyes appealed to the Supreme Court [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N there is a material variance between the Municipal Court’s decision and the writ of execution regarding the order to vacate.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CFI's decision. While the dispositive part of the Municipal Court's decision in the unlawful detainer case did not provide with desired clarity that the defendants should vacate the property, the granting of such relief is **clearly inferable** from the portion requiring the defendant to pay rent "up to the time she finally vacates the place" [7, 8]. The Court held that there appears to be no material variance between the decision and the writ of execution issued therein, as the intent of the decision to order the vacation of the premises was implied by the language regarding the duration of rental payments [9, 10].

Decision reversed and the petition for prohibition is dismissed [10].
