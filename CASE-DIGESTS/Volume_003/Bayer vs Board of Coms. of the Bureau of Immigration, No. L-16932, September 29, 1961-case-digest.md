**I. CAPTION**
**JAN BAYER v. THE HONORABLE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE BUREAU OF IMMIGRATION**, G.R. No. L-16932, September 29, 1961.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Jan Bayer, a Polish citizen, arrived in the Philippines in 1949 as a transient with an expired passport. He was allowed to stay temporarily but failed to leave upon the expiration of his permit. Warrants for his arrest were issued on three occasions, but deportation was repeatedly stayed to grant his requests for extensions, quota allotments, and political asylum [1-3]. On December 9, 1952, pending a decision on his deportation, he was released on bond with the condition to depart voluntarily by June 1, 1953, which he failed to do [4, 5]. He subsequently sought political asylum from the President, which was denied on November 17, 1954 [3]. On the same day, Bayer filed a petition for certiorari (prohibition) with the lower court, even though the deportation proceedings before the Board of Commissioners were still pending and unresolved [3, 6]. The lower court dismissed the petition [7, 8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petition for certiorari is premature given that the deportation proceedings are still pending before the Board of Commissioners.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the action was premature because the deportation proceedings were still pending before the Board of Commissioners [6].

The Court held that courts will not interfere with immigration proceedings unless "it is shown that the deportee is being indefinitely imprisoned under the pretense of awaiting a chance for deportation or unless the Government admits that it can not deport him or unless the detainee is being held for too long a period" (*Borovsky v. Commissioner of Immigration* and *Johnson v. Commissioner of Immigration*) [7]. In this case, Bayer was not being indefinitely detained; he had been released on bond [5, 9]. Furthermore, the delay in the proceedings was not undue but caused by Bayer's own repeated requests for extensions and appeals to various authorities [9]. Since there was no final decision from the immigration authorities to review, and no exception applied, judicial interference was unwarranted [10].

**Petition denied; decision of the lower court affirmed.**
