I. CAPTION
ESPERANZA FERNANDEZ v. HON. HERMOGENES CALUAG and J. M. TUASON & CO., INC., G.R. No. L-16124, December 30, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent J.M. Tuason & Co. filed a complaint for recovery of possession against petitioner Fernandez [1]. On March 16, 1959, the Sheriff served the summons not to Fernandez, but to her lessee, Jovita Arenas, who was not authorized to receive it [2, 3]. Arenas handed the summons to Fernandez only on April 4, 1959 [2]. Fernandez immediately filed a motion for extension of time to answer, followed by her answer on April 8 [2]. However, the trial court declared her in default on April 11 [2]. Fernandez filed a verified motion to set aside the order of default on April 18, alleging excusable negligence and attaching affidavits of merit [3]. The trial court denied this motion and subsequently dismissed her appeal on the ground that, having been declared in default, she had lost standing in court [3, 4]. Fernandez filed a petition for Mandamus to compel the judge to allow her appeal [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is entitled to appeal the order denying her motion to set aside the order of default.
2. W/N a motion for reconsideration was necessary before filing the petition for Mandamus.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** From the order denying relief from an order declaring the petitioner in default, she is entitled to appeal [5, 6]. The lower court's disallowance of her record on appeal and dismissal of her appeal constitute an unlawful exclusion of the petitioner from the use and enjoyment of her statutory right to appeal [6, 7]. Mandamus is the proper remedy for an aggrieved party whose appeal or record on appeal is erroneously dismissed or disallowed [7, 8].

2. **NO.** A motion for reconsideration is not necessary as a condition precedent to filing Mandamus when a definite question has been properly raised, argued, and submitted to the court and has been passed upon by it [6, 9, 10]. The Court relied on the doctrine in *Chavez vs. Ocampo*, noting that the issue of the petitioner's right to appeal had already been fully argued by the parties in their respective pleadings regarding the approval of the record on appeal [6].

The petition is granted [11, 12].
