I. CAPTION
ASSOCIATED INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., plaintiff-appellee vs. VIVENCIO RIEL and JOVITO R. SALONGA, defendants; JOVITO R. SALONGA, defendant-appellant vs. TEODORO RIVERA, third-party defendant-appellee, G.R. No. L-17048, September 19, 1961, 3 SCRA 6, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Associated Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. (AISCO) issued a bond for Vivencio Riel. Riel and Jovito Salonga executed an indemnity agreement binding themselves jointly and severally to indemnify AISCO for any payments on the bond, including 15% attorney's fees [1]. After AISCO paid the P2,000 bond, it filed a complaint against Riel and Salonga for reimbursement [2].

During the case, Salonga filed a third-party complaint against Teodoro Rivera, based on an agreement where Rivera bound himself to indemnify Salonga for any judgment in the case [3]. The trial court admitted the third-party complaint, and Rivera was declared in default [4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila rendered judgment ordering Riel and Salonga to pay AISCO P2,000 plus interest and 15% of the *whole amount* as attorney's fees, but failed to make a finding on the third-party complaint [4, 5].

Salonga filed a Motion for Reconsideration. AISCO filed manifestations stating it had no objection to the motion provided the liability was fixed at P2,073.60 plus interest, and attorney's fees were reduced to 15% of the *interest* due [6]. The trial court denied the motion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the attorney's fees should be reduced based on the plaintiff's manifestation.
2. W/N the lower court erred in failing to resolve the third-party complaint.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The attorney's fees should be reduced to 15% of the interest due. The manifestations filed by AISCO indicating its lack of objection to the reduction constitute **admissions against interest** [7]. The trial court should have considered these admissions in modifying its decision regarding the attorney's fees [8].

2. **YES.** Where a third-party complaint has been admitted and evidence to sustain it (Exhibit "1") has been presented, the trial court is bound to make findings thereon [9, 10]. To avoid multiplicity of suits, the Supreme Court resolved the issue, holding Rivera liable to indemnify Salonga for whatever amount the latter may pay to AISCO [10].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision is **MODIFIED**. Defendants-appellants are ordered to pay P2,073.60 with interest, and attorney's fees of 15% of the interest due. The third-party defendant is condemned to pay the third-party plaintiff whatever the latter pays the plaintiff-appellee [11].
