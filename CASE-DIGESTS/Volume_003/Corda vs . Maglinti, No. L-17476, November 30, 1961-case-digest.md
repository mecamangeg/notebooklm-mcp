I. CAPTION
BERNARDO CORDA, ET AL. v. EUGENIO MAGLINTI, G.R. No. L-17476, November 30, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On October 26, 1948, petitioners (Corda, et al.) filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 1142) against respondent Maglinti to recover two parcels of land and damages for fruits received by the latter since December 1939 [1]. The trial court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) modified the decision, declaring petitioners owners of 5/7 of the property and respondent 2/7, but affirmed the trial court's decision in all other respects [1]. Notably, the CA passed *sub-silencio* on the specific assignment of error regarding the award of damages, and petitioners did not file a motion for reconsideration [2], [3]. The decision became final.

Subsequently, petitioners filed the present action for partition [4]. The parties submitted an amicable settlement regarding the land division, containing a clause reserving "whatever claims the parties have against each other" for court determination [5]. Relying on this reservation, petitioners sought to present evidence for the same damages claimed in the previous case [6]. The trial court denied the request on the ground of *res judicata* [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners' claim for damages is barred by *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the claim for damages is barred. In the original case (Civil Case No. 1142), petitioners specifically claimed damages for fruits, which the trial court dismissed [2]. Although the CA modified the ruling on ownership, it passed upon the claim for damages *sub-silencio*, implicitly affirming the trial court's dismissal of that claim [2], [3]. Due to petitioners' failure to file a petition for reconsideration, the CA decision became final and the matter cannot be revived without violating the principle of *res judicata* [3].

The Court further explained that the reservation clause in the parties' amicable settlement ("whatever claims...") did not revive the barred claim. Instead, it referred to other claims not included in the former case, such as the fruits accruing during the receivership in the pending partition proceedings [3].

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [7].
