I. CAPTION
ASUNCION FRANCISCO and ADRIANO VILLANUEVA v. HON. HERMOGENES CALUAG and EMILIANO ADRIANO, G.R. No. L-15365, December 26, 1961, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In February 1957, respondent Emiliano Adriano filed a suit against petitioners Spouses Francisco and Villanueva for the recovery of a sum of money. When the case was called for hearing on June 20, 1958, petitioners failed to appear. The trial court authorized the presentation of evidence *ex parte* and rendered a decision on June 24, 1958. Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) regarding the *ex parte* order, which was denied. On October 6, 1958, they filed a second MR repeating the same grounds—specifically, that their lawyer lost his pocket calendar. The trial court denied this as *pro forma* and issued a writ of execution, ruling that the appeal period had not been suspended. After filing effectively third and fourth motions for reconsideration which were also denied, petitioners instituted a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court on May 6, 1959, nearly a year after the judgment was rendered.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the remedy of certiorari is proper to review the lower court's decision.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, ruling that the remedy of certiorari cannot be used as a substitute for appeal. The Court held that the subsequent motions for reconsideration filed by the spouses were merely *pro forma* because they repeated allegations from the first motion; consequently, these motions did not suspend the period within which to appeal [1, 2]. Since the petitioners failed to appeal within the reglementary period, the lower court's decision became final. Certiorari is not the correct remedy to obtain the review of a decision which has already become final [2].

Petition dismissed.
