**I. CAPTION**
THE CITY OF BUTUAN v. HON. JUDGE MONTANO A. ORTIZ and JUSTINIANO SORIANO, G.R. No. L-18054, December 22, 1961, 113 Phil. 636, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Justiniano Soriano, a police corporal, was administratively charged with physical injuries and electioneering by the Municipal Board of Butuan City. He was suspended, found guilty by the Board, and subsequently appealed to the Commissioner of Civil Service [1]. Pending the appeal, and after his 60-day preventive suspension lapsed without reinstatement, Soriano filed a petition for *mandamus* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan against the Mayor. The CFI rendered judgment ordering his reinstatement because the administrative case had not been decided within 60 days as required by Republic Act No. 557 [1, 2].

However, on November 29, 1954, the Commissioner of Civil Service affirmed the Municipal Board's decision, finding Soriano guilty and separating him from the service [2]. Years later, on January 12, 1960, Soriano filed an *ex-parte* motion to execute the CFI's judgment for reinstatement. Respondent Judge Ortiz granted the motion. The City of Butuan moved for reconsideration citing the Civil Service decision, but the court denied it. The City filed this petition to set aside the order of execution [2, 3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the judgment for reinstatement may be executed despite the subsequent decision of the Commissioner of Civil Service separating the respondent from the service.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the decision of the Commissioner of Civil Service finding Soriano guilty and separating him from the service was a "valid impediment" to the execution of the court's decision for reinstatement [1, 2]. This administrative decision constituted a "supervening cause" that rendered the court's reinstatement order no longer enforceable [2].

While a prevailing party is generally entitled to a writ of execution within five years from entry of judgment, the Court cited the doctrine in *De la Costa v. Cleofas*, stating that "when after judgment has been rendered... facts and circumstances transpire which render its execution impossible or unjust, the interested party may ask the court to modify or alter the judgment to harmonize the same with justice and the facts" [4]. Since Soriano was validly separated from service by the Commissioner, he had no right to execution for reinstatement.

Petition granted; the order for the execution of the judgment is set aside [5].
