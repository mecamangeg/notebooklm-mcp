I. CAPTION
PAMPANGA BUS COMPANY, INC. and LA MALLORCA v. MUNICIPALITY OF TARLAC, PROVINCE OF TARLAC, G.R. No. L-15759, December 30, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Pampanga Bus Company and La Mallorca (Appellees) operated a bus terminal on F. Tañedo Street in Tarlac. The terminal was built of strong materials, equipped with modern facilities, and designed to allow buses to enter and exit without maneuvering on the street, thus relieving pedestrian congestion [1], [2], [3].

On January 21, 1952, the Municipal Council of Tarlac enacted Ordinance No. 1, prohibiting the establishment or operation of bus terminals on F. Tañedo Street and granting existing terminals 30 days to transfer [4], [5]. Subsequently, Resolution No. 323 was passed ordering Appellees to remove their terminal within 10 days [6]. Appellees filed a suit to declare the ordinance void. The trial court ruled in favor of Appellees, finding the terminal was not a nuisance and that traffic congestion was caused by other vehicles (carromatas and jeeps), not the terminal [7]. The Municipality appealed, arguing the ordinance was a valid exercise of police power under the General Welfare Clause [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Ordinance No. 1 is valid under the General Welfare Clause.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the ordinance is invalid.

Under Section 2238 of the Revised Administrative Code (General Welfare Clause), ordinances must be necessary and proper to provide for the health, safety, peace, good order, comfort, and convenience of the municipality [9]. The Court found this requirement was not satisfied because the terminal was not a nuisance per se or per accidens; it was sanitary, well-equipped, and actually helped relieve congestion by keeping waiting passengers off the sidewalks [10]. The traffic obstruction was caused by other vehicles making U-turns, not by the Appellees' buses [7], [11].

Furthermore, the ordinance could not be sustained as a zoning ordinance because it did not comprehensively define residential or industrial zones [12]. It also failed to follow Civil Code provisions (Arts. 694-707) regarding the abatement of nuisances [13]. Finally, while municipalities can regulate garages under the Revised Motor Vehicle Law, such regulations must not encroach upon legitimate property rights [14].

The judgment appealing from is affirmed [14].
