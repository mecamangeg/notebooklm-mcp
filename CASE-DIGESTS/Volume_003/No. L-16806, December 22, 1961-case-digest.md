I. CAPTION
SERGIO DEL ROSARIO v. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16806, December 22, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On June 23, 1955, in Davao City, petitioner Sergio del Rosario, along with co-accused Alfonso Araneta and Benedicto del Pilar, showed complainant Apolinario del Rosario several Philippine one-peso and two-peso bills (Exhibits C, E, G, and H) [1]. They induced the complainant to believe that these bills were counterfeit paper money manufactured by them, although they were actually genuine treasury notes with altered digits in their serial numbers [1, 2]. Through this scheme, they obtained P1,700.00 from the complainant for the avowed purpose of financing the manufacture of more counterfeits [1].

The Court of First Instance of Davao convicted the accused of illegal possession of forged treasury notes. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but increased the maximum indeterminate penalty to 10 years, 8 months, and 1 day of *prisión mayor* [3]. Del Rosario appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that since the notes were genuine treasury notes, their possession could not be illegal [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the possession of genuine treasury notes with erased or altered figures constitutes a violation of Article 168 of the Revised Penal Code.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the possession of genuine treasury notes of the Philippines, in which any of "the figures, letters, words or signs contained" have been erased and/or altered, with knowledge of such erasure and alteration, and with the intent to use such notes, is punishable under **Article 168 in relation to Article 166, subdivision (1), of the Revised Penal Code** [4, 5].

The Court found no merit in the petitioner's contention that the genuineness of the notes precluded criminal liability. The specific act of erasing and changing digits in the serial numbers (e.g., changing '9' to '0') [2], coupled with the intent to use them to entice another to advance funds, constitutes the crime charged [1, 5]. The Court relied on the doctrine in *U.S. v. Gardner* (3 Phil. 398) and *U.S. v. Solito* (36 Phil. 785) [5].

Decision affirmed [5].
