I. CAPTION
VICTORIANO GUNDRAN, ET AL. v. THE RED LINE TRANSPORTATION COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-15747, November 3, 1961, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants Victoriano Gundran and others filed a complaint for damages against defendant-appellee Red Line Transportation Company, Inc. following the death of their relatives in a motorboat capsize in the Cagayan River in February 1953 [1]. The Court of First Instance of Cagayan dismissed the complaint [1]. The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court on April 29, 1959, because the total damages claimed (P429,529.00) exceeded the then-jurisdictional limit of P50,000.00 [2]. Subsequently, Republic Act No. 2613 took effect on August 1, 1959, raising the Supreme Court's exclusive appellate jurisdiction over amounts exceeding P200,000.00 [2]. The issues raised on appeal were mostly factual [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction based on the aggregate amount of damages claimed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the case falls within the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals. Although the aggregate claim of P429,529.00 exceeds the jurisdictional threshold of P200,000.00 established by Republic Act No. 2613, the individual claims of the plaintiffs were each far below that amount [3]. The Court held that "it is the individual claims, and not the totality of such claims, that is determinative of jurisdiction," particularly when amounts are alleged to be separately due to different appellants [3]. The Court relied on Section 88 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended, and the doctrine in *Santiago Sambrano, et al. v. Rehabilitation Finance Corporation* [3]. Furthermore, as the errors assigned involved mostly questions of fact, the appeal was proper for the Court of Appeals [3].

The appeal was certified back to the Court of Appeals for determination [4].
