I. CAPTION
MAXIMA C. DIZON v. JOSE ARRASTIA, G.R. No. L-15383, November 29, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In October 1943, during the Japanese occupation, defendant-appellant Jose Arrastia borrowed P10,000.00 from plaintiff-appellee Maxima C. Dizon [1]. To secure the debt, Arrastia executed a deed of mortgage on July 1, 1944, which stipulated that the loan would become due and demandable only after October 23, 1947, and that Arrastia expressly waived his right to pay the debt before said date [1, 2]. On October 9, 1944, claiming Dizon refused to accept payment, Arrastia consigned P12,436.00 in Japanese military notes with the Court of First Instance of Manila [3]. Dizon subsequently filed an action to foreclose the mortgage [4]. The lower court ruled in favor of Dizon, ordering Arrastia to pay the full P10,000.00 in Philippine currency [5]. Arrastia appealed, arguing he should not be liable for the full amount in Philippine currency but rather under the Ballantyne scale since the loan was contracted in Japanese notes [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the debtor could discharge the obligation before the stipulated date of October 23, 1947.
2. W/N the Ballantyne scale is applicable to the payment of the obligation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court reasoned that the mortgage deeds clearly stipulated the debt "will become due and demandable after October 23, 1947" and contained a special condition where the debtor waived his right to pay before that date [2]. Therefore, Arrastia had no right to discharge the obligation early without the creditor's consent, and Dizon could not be compelled to accept the consignation made in 1944 [2].

2. **NO.** Citing *Roño v. Gomez* and *Nicolas v. Matias*, the Court held that when an obligation assumed during the Japanese occupation is made payable after the liberation of the Philippines, the parties are deemed to have intended that the amount be paid in the currency that is legal tender at the time the obligation becomes due [6]. Since the obligation matured in 1947 (post-liberation), it must be satisfied peso for peso in Philippine currency, rendering the Ballantyne scale inapplicable [6, 7].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Padilla, J., dissented for the reasons explained in his previous dissenting opinions [7].
