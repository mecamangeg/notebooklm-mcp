I. CAPTION
POLO, YNTE, ANDRES FIANZA, ET AL. v. THE NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17477, December 30, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Polo, et al. claimed to have located three placer mining claims in Bokod, Benguet in November 1933 [1]. In 1953, they protested against the National Power Corporation (NPC) extracting gravel and sand from the area [1]. NPC opposed the claims before the Bureau of Mines, arguing the claims were abandoned or forfeited and the area was reserved for water-power purposes [2, 3]. On December 20, 1955, the Director of Mines ruled that Petitioners had lost their rights to the claims [3]. Petitioners received this decision on January 5, 1956 [4]. Instead of appealing within 30 days, Petitioners filed a complaint for ownership and damages in the Court of First Instance of Baguio City on September 5, 1956 [4]. The trial court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that under Section 61 of Commonwealth Act No. 137, the decision of the Director of Mines became final after 30 days [5]. Petitioners appealed, arguing that the controversy was not a "mining dispute" under the law because NPC was not a mining locator [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the controversy between Petitioners and NPC constitutes a "conflict or dispute arising out of a mining location" under Section 61 of Commonwealth Act No. 137. [6]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. The Court held that for a dispute to arise out of a mining location, it is not necessary that there be two parties claiming the same mining rights [7]. A dispute falls within the purview of Section 61 of Commonwealth Act No. 137 when any party, even if not a locator or transferee, disputes the status of a mining claim due to non-compliance, forfeiture, or abandonment and submits the matter to the Director of Mines [7].

Because the controversy was a mining dispute, the procedure under Section 61 applied, requiring an appeal to the court within 30 days of receiving the Director's decision [8]. Since Petitioners received the decision on January 5, 1956, but did not file suit until September 5, 1956, the 30-day period had long expired, making the administrative decision final and binding [9, 10]. The Court further ruled that the claim for damages was incidental to the claim of ownership; since jurisdiction over the main issue failed, the incidental claim must also fail [11].

The order appealed from is affirmed [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes (J.B.L.), Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, and De Leon concurred [12].
