I. CAPTION
SIMEON T. GARCIA v. ARTURO B. PASCUAL, Mayor of the Municipality of San Jose, Nueva Ecija, EULOGIO STA. MARIA, Municipal Treasurer, and MUNICIPALITY OF SAN JOSE, NUEVA ECIJA, G.R. No. L-16950, December 22, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On July 1, 1958, the Acting Justice of the Peace of San Jose, Nueva Ecija appointed petitioner Simeon T. Garcia as Clerk of Court [1]. This appointment was approved by the Department of Justice and the Civil Service Commission [1]. Garcia submitted vouchers for his salary, but the Municipal Treasurer and the Mayor, respondents herein, refused to approve payment [1]. The Mayor relied on the opinion of the Provincial Fiscal that Republic Act No. 1551, which empowers Mayors to appoint all employees paid out of municipal general funds, had repealed Section 75 of the Judiciary Act (R.A. No. 296), which authorizes Justices of the Peace to appoint their own clerks [2-4].

Garcia filed a petition for mandamus. The Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija ruled in favor of Garcia, holding that R.A. No. 1551 did not repeal Section 75 of the Judiciary Act and that the power to appoint the clerk remained with the Justice of the Peace to ensure independence from political pressure [3, 5]. Respondents appealed [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Republic Act No. 1551 repealed Section 75 of the Judiciary Act, thereby transferring the power to appoint the Clerk of Court of the Justice of the Peace to the Municipal Mayor.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision.

The Court held that the independence of the judiciary is a fundamental principle of the Constitution, which would be hampered if subordinate officials of the courts were subject to appointment by the executive head of the municipality [6]. Justices of the Peace are appointed by the President, similar to judges of superior courts, pursuant to the separation of powers [6].

Furthermore, applying the rule of statutory construction, R.A. No. 1551 is a general law covering municipal employees in the executive branch, while Section 75 of the Judiciary Act is a specific law regarding court personnel [6]. A subsequent general law does not repeal a prior specific law unless there is an express repeal or absolute necessity [7]. The specific provision must be taken as an exception to the general act [7]. The Court also gave weight to the Secretary of Justice's opinion that Section 75 was not repealed, as his opinions override those of provincial fiscals [8].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision appealed from is affirmed with costs against the appellants.
