I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LONGENOS PEÑAFIEL, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17669, December 30, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of June 8, 1958, appellants Emilio Porras, Glicerio Pawag, and Longenos Peñafiel, along with others, intruded into the house of Paz Presidente in Iloilo [1, 2]. While Peñafiel stood guard over a stolen trunk on the back porch, Porras and Pawag, together with an unidentified companion, took turns raping Paz Presidente after threatening her and her family and ransacking the house for valuables [3-5]. The victims positively identified the appellants, who were their neighbors [6]. The appellants raised the defense of alibi, claiming they were elsewhere working or tending to sick family members during the incident [2, 7, 8]. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo convicted the appellants, though it found Peñafiel not guilty of the rape charge as he was unaware of the outrage committed by his companions [9, 10].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defense of alibi is sufficient to overturn the conviction despite positive identification by the victims.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that for the defense of alibi to prosper, the evidence must be clear and convincing enough to preclude the possibility of the accused's presence at the scene, and the evidence regarding their identification must be weak [11, 12]. In this case, the requisites were not met because the victims positively identified the appellants, whom they knew well as neighbors [6, 12]. Furthermore, the Court ruled it inconceivable that a married Filipino woman would concoct a story exposing her honor to public contempt merely to satisfy a desire for revenge [13].

Finding the crime to be Robbery with Multiple Rape attended by the aggravating circumstances of dwelling and nocturnity, the Supreme Court modified the decision to impose *reclusion perpetua* on Porras and Pawag, and affirmed the penalty imposed on Peñafiel (who participated in the robbery but not the rape) [10, 14].
