I. CAPTION
San Miguel Brewery, Inc. v. Betia, G.R. No. L-16403, October 30, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On April 28, 1959, respondent Jesus Betia, an employee of petitioner San Miguel Brewery, Inc., filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to recover compensation for overtime services rendered [1]. Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter [1]. The CIR denied the motion and the subsequent motion for reconsideration [1]. Petitioners then filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court, arguing that the CIR had no jurisdiction over claims for overtime pay [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over the claim for overtime compensation where the employer-employee relationship exists.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, ruling that the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has jurisdiction [2]. The Court relied on the doctrine established in *Price Stabilization Corporation (PRISCO) v. Court of Industrial Relations* (G.R. No. L-13806, May 23, 1960), which settled that where the employer-employee relationship is still existing or is sought to be reestablished (such as when reinstatement is sought), the CIR has jurisdiction over all claims arising out of or in connection with employment, including those related to the Minimum Wage Law and the Eight-Hour Labor Law [3]. Conversely, claims become mere money claims under the jurisdiction of regular courts only after the termination of the relationship if no reinstatement is sought [3, 4]. Accordingly, the case was dismissed and the petition denied [2].
