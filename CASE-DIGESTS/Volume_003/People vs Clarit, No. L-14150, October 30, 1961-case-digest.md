**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ALEJANDRO CLARIT and TEOFILO CLARIT, G.R. No. L-14150, October 30, 1961, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
Prior to May 1, 1952, Orencio Gandamon (victim) and his family lived in Zamboanga del Norte on land claimed by Paulino Clarit, the father of the accused Alejandro and Teofilo Clarit. Alejandro had previously burned Orencio’s house due to this dispute and was convicted of arson [1, 2]. On the evening of May 1, 1952, while Orencio’s family was eating supper in a temporary house, a gunshot was fired from outside, wounding Orencio in the chest [3]. Immediately after the explosion, the victim's wife and children saw Alejandro and Teofilo standing nearby, with Alejandro holding a gun [3]. The night was moonlit, allowing positive identification [4].

The Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Norte convicted Alejandro as principal for Murder and Teofilo as an accomplice [5]. The accused appealed, relying on alibi and citing discrepancies in the wife's testimony [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt despite the alleged testimonial discrepancies.
2. W/N Teofilo Clarit is liable as a principal due to conspiracy.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The accused were positively identified by three witnesses (the victim's wife and children) who knew them as neighbors [4, 7]. The discrepancy in the wife's testimony regarding when she saw the accused was explained by a language barrier, as the police officer did not speak her dialect (Subano) [6]. Furthermore, the alibi was weak as it was provided by the accused and their close relatives, whereas the witnesses positively identified them at the scene [7].

2. **YES.** Teofilo is liable as a principal because conspiracy was established. Article 8 of the Revised Penal Code requires an agreement to commit a felony, but this agreement need not be written or express; it is sufficient that it be implied from acts showing a common design [8]. Previous acquaintance or detailed knowledge of each other's part is not necessary [8]. Here, both brothers had an interest in the land dispute, both had previously threatened the victim, and both were present at the scene of the crime [9].

**Disposition:** The judgment is **MODIFIED**. Alejandro Clarit's conviction is affirmed with indemnity reduced to P3,000. Teofilo Clarit is found guilty as a **PRINCIPAL** and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*, with indemnity fixed at P3,000 [10].
