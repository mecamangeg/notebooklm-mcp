I. CAPTION
LEON DE JESUS, ET AL. v. EUSEBIA DE JESUS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16553, November 29, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Melecio de Jesus died intestate. His widow and administratrix, Ines Alejandrino, included Lot No. 931 in the estate inventory. The deceased's sister, Eusebia de Jesus, filed a money claim against the estate. On May 24, 1948, Ines, Eusebia, and the heirs of the deceased's brother Cirilo entered into a stipulation recognizing that Lot 931 was co-owned by Melecio, Eusebia, and Cirilo, and was registered in Melecio's name only in trust. Eusebia waived her money claim in exchange. The probate court approved these stipulations on May 25, 1948.

Years later, Leon de Jesus replaced Ines as administrator. In 1958, Leon and Ines filed a complaint to annul the stipulations, arguing the probate court lacked jurisdiction and that the heirs, who were minors at the time, received no notice. The trial court dismissed the complaint on grounds of *res judicata* and prescription.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the probate court had jurisdiction to approve the stipulations recognizing the trust.
2. W/N the order approving the stipulations is void for lack of notice to the heirs.
3. W/N the successor-administrator is estopped from questioning the acts of the previous administratrix.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The probate court had jurisdiction to approve the agreement. Under Section 9, Rule 90 of the Rules of Court, the probate court may authorize an administrator to deed property held in trust by the deceased to the true beneficiaries. As there was no controversy regarding the co-ownership and the trust character of the title, the court properly approved the recognition of ownership to forestall litigation [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The order and the stipulations are void for lack of notice. Section 9, Rule 90 requires that notice be given to all interested persons in accordance with Section 8, Rule 90. This requirement is mandatory; without it, the order and conveyance are "completely void" [3]. The heirs were minors at the time, and no guardian *ad litem* was appointed to receive notice on their behalf [4]. Under the law prior to the New Civil Code, parents were not the legal representatives of their children's property without judicial authorization [4]. Being a void proceeding, the action to set it aside is imprescriptible [5].

3. **NO.** A successor-administrator is not estopped. Even an administrator is not estopped from questioning the validity of his own void deed; *a fortiori*, a successor cannot be estopped from questioning the acts of a predecessor that are not conformable to law [6].

The order dismissing the complaint is **REVERSED** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [7].
