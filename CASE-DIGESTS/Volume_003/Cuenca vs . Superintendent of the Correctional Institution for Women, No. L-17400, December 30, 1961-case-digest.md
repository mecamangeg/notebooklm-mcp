I. CAPTION
EPIFANIA CUENCA Y MENDOZA v. THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION FOR WOMEN, G.R. No. L-17400, December 30, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
In 1955, petitioner Cuenca was convicted of theft by the Municipal Court of Manila. She was sentenced to two months and one day of *arresto mayor* plus an additional penalty of twelve (12) years of *prision mayor* for being a habitual delinquent. She did not appeal and began serving her sentence. In 1960, after serving over five years, she filed a petition for *habeas corpus* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal. She argued that the additional penalty was void because the information failed to specifically allege the dates of commission of her previous offenses, and that the 12-year penalty was excessive because her record only supported a finding of a fourth conviction (punishable by up to 10 years), not a fifth conviction. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that while the penalty was indeed excessive, *habeas corpus* was not the proper remedy as she had not yet served the lawful 10-year portion of the sentence.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a writ of *habeas corpus* lies to correct an alleged excessive penalty imposed by a final judgment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The writ of *habeas corpus* cannot function as a writ of error. It issues only for want of jurisdiction of the sentencing court. Mere mistakes of fact or law, such as the appreciation of the number of previous convictions or the application of the corresponding penalty, do not nullify proceedings if the court has jurisdiction over the crime and the person of the defendant. The Municipal Court had jurisdiction to impose the additional penalty for habitual delinquency under Article 62, paragraph 5 of the Revised Penal Code. Its error in imposing 12 years instead of the statutory maximum of 10 years (for a fourth conviction) was an error of judgment correctible only by seasonable appeal, not by *habeas corpus*. This is distinguished from cases like *Cruz v. Director of Prisons*, where the writ was allowed because the penalty imposed was one the court had absolutely no authority to impose under any circumstances.

The judgment of the lower court is AFFIRMED.
