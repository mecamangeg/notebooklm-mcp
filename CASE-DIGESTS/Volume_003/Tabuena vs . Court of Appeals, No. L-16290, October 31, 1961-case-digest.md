I. CAPTION
SANTOS TABUENA v. COURT OF APPEALS and EUGENIO DE LA CRUZ, G.R. No. L-16290, October 31, 1961, J.B.L. Reyes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Santos Tabuena sued respondent Eugenio De la Cruz, Director of the Forest Products Research Institute, for damages and appointment to the position of Administrative Assistant II. The complaint alleged De la Cruz acted in bad faith and sued him in both his official and personal capacities. The trial court ruled in favor of Tabuena, ordering his appointment and sentencing De la Cruz *in his personal capacity* to pay moral damages and attorney's fees. De la Cruz filed a notice of appeal but claimed exemption from posting an appeal bond. Tabuena moved for the bond and for execution pending appeal. The trial court granted both motions, ordering immediate execution (appointment) and requiring the bond. De la Cruz filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA annulled the trial court’s orders, holding that De la Cruz was exempt from the bond requirement as a public officer, and consequently, the trial court had lost jurisdiction to order execution.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a public officer sued in both official and personal capacities is exempt from filing an appeal bond.
2. W/N execution pending appeal is justified by the petitioner's length of service and financial prejudice.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The general rule exempting the Government from appeal bonds applies only when the action is brought against public officers impleaded merely as nominal representatives sued purely in their official capacity [1, 2]. Here, De la Cruz was sued in his personal capacity for acts allegedly done in bad faith, and the judgment held him personally liable for damages [3]. A public officer is not immune from damages in his personal capacity for illegal acts done in bad faith (Art. 27, Civil Code) [3, 4]. Consequently, the exemption does not apply, and he must file an appeal bond.

2. **NO.** Under Section 2, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, execution pending appeal requires "good reasons" stated in a special order [5, 6]. The trial court's justification—Tabuena's length of service, the delay of the case, and prejudice to his family—may call for sympathy but do not constitute the "weighty reasons" required [5, 6]. Public office is a solemn trust that cannot accommodate the vagaries of personal fortunes [5, 6]. Furthermore, if the judgment were executed and later reversed, the damages to the incumbent or the government might be irreparable [7].

The decision of the Court of Appeals setting aside the execution pending appeal is **AFFIRMED**, while the orders of the trial court requiring the respondent to file an appeal bond are **REINSTATED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
