I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ADOLFO SAEZ, G.R. No. L-15776, September 26, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant-appellant Adolfo Saez filed a motion for reconsideration and/or new trial alleging newly discovered evidence in the form of an affidavit or confession by one Roman Catian, which was purportedly suppressed by the Constabulary authorities in Davao. On May 12, 1961, the Supreme Court required the Solicitor General to answer this motion within ten days. The Solicitor General was granted two extensions to file the answer, reasoning that his office needed to request the Chief of the Philippine Constabulary to investigate the alleged suppression of evidence. The last extension expired thirty days from July 3, 1961, but the Solicitor General failed to file the required answer [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Solicitor General should be required to manifest his intent to file an answer to the motion for new trial given the delay.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court noted the "long lapse of time" since the motion for reconsideration and/or new trial was filed without the Solicitor General submitting the required answer. Consequently, the Court ordered the Solicitor General to state for the record, within five days from notice, whether or not he intends to file an answer to the said motion [1, 2].
