**I. CAPTION**
RICARDO L. MANALILI v. GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-15874, September 19, 1961, De Leon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Ricardo L. Manalili, a World War II veteran, held a Backpay Certificate of Indebtedness issued by the National Treasurer under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 304. In 1957, long after the passage of R.A. 304 and its amendatory act R.A. 897, Manalili obtained two real estate loans from the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) totaling P13,600.00. He failed to pay the monthly amortizations starting December 1957. When GSIS applied for extra-judicial foreclosure of the mortgage in 1959, Manalili requested the GSIS Board of Trustees to apply his Backpay Certificate to pay his overdue amortizations. The Board denied his request.

Manalili filed a petition for mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan to compel GSIS to accept the certificate. GSIS argued that under the Backpay Law, mandatory acceptance applies only to obligations subsisting at the time of the law's approval. The CFI dismissed the complaint. Manalili appealed, arguing that the acceptance is mandatory and that his obligation was extinguished by confusion or merger of rights since the Government owes him (via the certificate) and he owes the GSIS (a government instrumentality).

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N GSIS can be compelled by mandamus to accept the Backpay Certificate for payment of a loan incurred after the approval of R.A. 304 and R.A. 897.
2. W/N Manalili's obligation to GSIS was extinguished by confusion, merger of rights, or compensation.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that mandamus will not lie because the duty to accept the certificate is not ministerial but discretionary. Under Section 2 of R.A. 304 and R.A. 897, the mandatory acceptance of backpay certificates by government-owned or controlled corporations is limited to obligations **subsisting at the time of the approval of the Acts** (June 18, 1948, and June 20, 1953, respectively). Since Manalili incurred his indebtedness to GSIS in 1957—long after the approval of these Acts—the acceptance of the certificate is merely directory or discretionary on the part of GSIS. The Court relied on *Diokno v. Rehabilitation Finance Corporation*, which established that for non-subsisting obligations, the acceptance depends on the sound discretion of the corporation and the availability of loanable funds.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that there can be no compensation, confusion, or merger of rights to extinguish the obligation. While Manalili is a creditor of the Government regarding his backpay, he is a debtor of the GSIS. Citing *Abad Santos v. Auditor General*, the Court explained that the GSIS is a private corporation with a personality separate and distinct from the Government. Therefore, a claim against the Government is not necessarily a claim against the GSIS, and their respective obligations cannot be offset against each other.

**Petition is DENIED.** The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED**.
