I. CAPTION
ATLANTIC GULF & PACIFIC CO. OF MANILA, INC., petitioner, vs. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and A.G. & P. EMPLOYEES & WORKERS’ UNION (PAFLU), respondents., G.R. No. L-16992, December 23, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Felipe Mercado, a foreman supervisor employed by petitioner Atlantic Gulf & Pacific Co. (AG&P) for 30 years, was an organizer and officer of the respondent Union [1]. He was active in union meetings and served as a watcher in a certification election in July 1958 [1]. AG&P’s shop superintendent had previously branded the Union as a communist organization and compared Mercado to Huk leader Luis Taruc [2, 3]. On October 24, 1958, Mercado showed the company gateman two brushes and a hammer handle he intended to use at the cemetery for All Saints' Day, agreeing to leave them at the gate when advised to get a pass [2]. On October 28, AG&P dismissed him for alleged theft of company property [4]. The Union filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP). The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) convicted AG&P of ULP, finding the dismissal was actually due to union activities, noting that another employee suspected of stealing ten drums was merely suspended [3-5]. AG&P appealed, arguing insufficient evidence and claiming Mercado, as a supervisor, was ineligible for union membership under Republic Act No. 875 [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal of Mercado constitutes Unfair Labor Practice.
2. W/N a supervisor is considered an "employee" entitled to protection against ULP under Republic Act No. 875.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the CIR’s factual finding that Mercado’s dismissal was discriminatory and due to his union activities [3, 6]. The Court cited the following circumstances: (1) Mercado’s 30 years of efficient service; (2) his voluntary declaration of the items to the gateman; (3) the lack of opportunity to defend himself; (4) the disparity in penalty compared to another employee suspended for six months for a much graver offense (stealing 10 drums); and (5) the shop superintendent’s proven anti-union bias [3].

2. **YES.** Section 3 of Republic Act No. 875 explicitly provides that "employees"—a term encompassing supervisors—have the right to self-organization [8]. While the law allows supervisors to form separate organizations, in relation to their employer, a foreman or supervisor is still an "employee" within the meaning of the Act [8]. Consequently, supervisors are entitled to engage in union activities, and any discrimination against them by reason thereof constitutes an unfair labor practice [8]. The Court distinguished RA 875 from US statutes (like the Taft-Hartley Act) which expressly exclude supervisors from the definition of "employee" [8].

Decision affirmed [9].
