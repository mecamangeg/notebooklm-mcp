I. CAPTION
NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION v. IGNACIO VALERA, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-15295, November 30, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents filed a claim for unpaid wages against petitioner National Power Corporation (NPC) and Central Surety and Insurance Company before the Department of Labor in Davao City. After an initial award was set aside, a second hearing was held where NPC allegedly lacked proper notice. A second award was issued in favor of respondents [1]. A writ of execution followed, and the sheriff levied on NPC's personal properties [2].

NPC filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu to stop the execution. Instead of filing an answer, respondents filed a Motion to Dismiss alleging five grounds: (1) failure to state a cause of action; (2) the decision was final and executory; (3) the action was an unsanctioned collateral remedy; (4) non-exhaustion of administrative remedies; and (5) the action was dilatory [3, 4]. The CFI dismissed the petition based on these grounds. NPC appealed, arguing the dismissal was improper under the Rules of Court [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the petition for prohibition based on grounds not explicitly enumerated in Rule 8 (now Rule 16) of the Rules of Court was proper.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the order of dismissal.

Under Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the provisions of the preceding rules (Rules 1-64) apply to special civil actions like prohibition [6, 7]. Consequently, a motion to dismiss a special civil action must be based on the specific grounds enumerated in Section 1, Rule 8 (now Rule 16) [7].

In this case, only the first ground alleged by respondents—that the petition did not state a cause of action—falls within the purview of Rule 8 [8]. The other grounds invoked (finality of decision, collateral attack, etc.) are not proper grounds for a motion to dismiss and should not have been used to dismiss the action without a hearing on the merits [8]. Furthermore, the Court found that the verified petition was sufficient in form and substance to state a cause of action. Even assuming arguendo that the allegations were insufficient, the lower court should have allowed the petitioner to amend the petition rather than dismissing it outright [8].

The Order appealed from is **REVERSED** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [9].
