I. CAPTION
ALIPIO GONZALES v. HON. SERGIO OSMEÑA, JR., et al., G.R. No. L-15901, December 30, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alipio Gonzales, a civil service eligible, held the permanent position of deputy detective inspector in the Cebu City Police Department. On December 28, 1956, Respondent City Mayor Sergio Osmeña, Jr. notified him that his position was abolished pursuant to Ordinance No. 220, terminating his services effective December 31, 1956. Simultaneously, the Mayor issued a new appointment for Gonzales as "Police Sergeant" with a higher salary, but the appointment was designated as "good until revoked." Gonzales refused this new appointment and sought reinstatement with back salaries.

The Court of First Instance of Cebu ordered his reinstatement, ruling the abolition invalid, but denied his claim for back salaries. The lower court reasoned that the City of Cebu, which would fund the payment, was not impleaded as a party respondent. Gonzales appealed the denial of back salaries to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to formally implead the City of Cebu precludes the award of back salaries.
2. W/N the petitioner's refusal to accept the new promotional appointment bars his claim for back salaries.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the ends of justice and equity are best served if the inclusion of the City of Cebu is considered a "mere formality and deemed effected," even if not formally impleaded. Citing *Mangubat vs. Osmeña, Jr.* (G.R. No. L-12837), the Court explained that since the City Mayor, Municipal Board, City Auditor, and City Treasurer were all named respondents and represented by the City Attorney, the City's interests were substantially protected and due process was satisfied. Dismissing the case merely to amend pleadings would subordinate substance to form.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner was justified in refusing the new appointment. The appointment offered was temporary in nature because it was "good until revoked." As a civil service eligible holding a permanent position, the petitioner "had all the right to decline" a temporary appointment.

The judgment appealed from is REVERSED, and the respondents are directed to pay the petitioner back salaries from January 1, 1957, until his reinstatement.
