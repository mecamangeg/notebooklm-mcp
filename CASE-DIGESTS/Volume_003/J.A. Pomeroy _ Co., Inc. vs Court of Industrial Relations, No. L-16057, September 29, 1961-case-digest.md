**I. CAPTION**
J. A. POMEROY & COMPANY, INC., HAWAIIAN DREDGING COMPANY, LTD., and BECHTEL CORPORATION v. THE HON. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, MOISES VALENCIA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16057, September 29, 1961, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 27, 1959, private respondents Moises Valencia and 13 other laborers filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against petitioners for the collection of separation pay, interest, attorney’s fees, and damages [1, 2]. The complaint alleged unjust separation but did not claim unfair labor practice nor ask for reinstatement [3]. The laborers had been dismissed in late 1957 and 1958, meaning no employer-employee relationship existed at the time of filing [2, 3]. Petitioners filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the CIR lacked jurisdiction over a case purely for separation pay without an employer-employee relationship [2]. The CIR denied the motion, citing *Gomez v. North Camarines Lumber Company, Inc.* [2]. The CIR *en banc* affirmed the denial, prompting petitioners to file this petition for certiorari [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over a money claim for separation pay where there is no existing employer-employee relationship and no prayer for reinstatement.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the CIR lacks jurisdiction. Citing *PRISCO v. CIR* (G.R. No. L-13806), the Court held that the CIR's jurisdiction over claims arising from employment (such as those related to the Minimum Wage Law) applies only when the employer-employee relationship is still existing or is sought to be reestablished (e.g., via reinstatement) [4]. When the relationship has terminated and no reinstatement is sought, such claims become "mere money claims" that fall within the jurisdiction of the regular courts [4]. The Court noted that the *Gomez* ruling relied upon by the CIR had already been expressly overruled by *PRISCO* [4].

Accordingly, the order of the Court of Industrial Relations is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **DISMISSED** [5].
