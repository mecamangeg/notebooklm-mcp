I. CAPTION
NESTOR RIGOR VDA. DE QUIAMBAO, ET AL. v. MANILA MOTOR COMPANY, INC. and the HON. COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-17384, October 31, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On March 7, 1940, Gaudencio Quiambao bought a Studebaker car from Manila Motor Company, Inc. on installment but defaulted on payments [1]. The company sued him, and on December 4, 1940, the CFI of Manila rendered judgment ordering him to pay P3,054.32 plus interest and fees [1]. A writ of execution was issued on July 14, 1941, levying two parcels of land in Tarlac [2]. To suspend the execution sale and gain time to pay, Gaudencio surrendered the car to the company on August 27, 1941, receiving a receipt stating the surrender was "pending settlement of the judgment" [2, 3]. He subsequently paid P500.00 on October 16, 1941 [3].

During the Japanese occupation, the car was seized by enemy forces [4]. After the war, the company received P409.75 in war damage compensation for the car [4]. In 1953, the company demanded settlement from Gaudencio's widow, petitioner Nestora Rigor Vda. de Quiambao, and upon refusal, sought to proceed with the auction sale of the levied lands based on the pre-war writ [4, 5]. The heirs filed a suit to annul the writ [5]. The CFI ruled in favor of the heirs, but the Court of Appeals reversed the decision and dismissed the complaint [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the surrender of the car rescinded the contract of sale or barred the execution of the judgment.
2. W/N the war damage compensation received by the company amounted to a foreclosure of the chattel mortgage.
3. W/N the pre-war judgment had prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The surrender of the car did not rescind the sale nor waive the right to execute the judgment. Unlike cases where a vendor demands the return of the thing sold to rescind the contract, here the buyer (Gaudencio) pleaded to surrender the car only to gain time and suspend the execution sale [6]. The receipt explicitly stated the car was received "pending settlement of the judgment," and Gaudencio even made a subsequent payment of P500.00, proving the company held the car merely as security for the judgment credit [6, 7].

2. **NO.** The receipt of war damage compensation did not amount to foreclosure. As the party last in possession, the company was obligated to protect the interests of the car owner and itself by claiming compensation [8]. Under *Manila Motor Company, Inc. v. Fernandez* and *Pacific Commercial Company v. De la Rama*, it is the actual sale of the mortgaged chattel in accordance with Section 14 of Act No. 1508 that bars the creditor from recovering the unpaid balance [9].

3. **NO.** The judgment had not prescribed. While over 13 years had elapsed from entry of judgment (1940) to the attempted sale (1954), the prescriptive period was interrupted by the Debt Moratorium (Executive Order No. 32) and the closure of courts during the war [10, 11]. Deducting the moratorium period (3 years, 4 months, 16 days) and the time courts were closed (judicially noticed per *Talens v. Chuakay*), the 10-year limitation for enforcing the levy had not expired [11]. A valid levy made within five years of judgment may be enforced by sale within ten years (*Government of P.I. v. Echaus*) [12].

The petition is DENIED, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED, with the modification that the P409.75 war damage payment be credited to the petitioners [13].
