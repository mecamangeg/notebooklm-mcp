I. CAPTION
MANUEL TIBERIO v. MANILA PILOTS ASSOCIATION, G.R. No. L-17661, December 28, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Manuel Tiberio was employed as a sailor by respondent Manila Pilots Association from June 7, 1953, until June 30, 1955, when he went on vacation due to illness. He filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to recover P5,204.37 in overtime compensation. Respondent moved to dismiss on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction and prescription. The CIR dismissed the complaint, reasoning that it lacked jurisdiction because Tiberio did not seek reinstatement, which implied the termination of the employer-employee relationship. The CIR further ruled that the action had prescribed under Republic Act No. 1993 as it was filed more than three years after the cause of action accrued. The CIR *en banc* affirmed the dismissal, prompting Tiberio to file this petition for review.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR has jurisdiction over the money claim despite the absence of a prayer for reinstatement.
2. W/N the action for overtime pay has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The CIR has jurisdiction. The Supreme Court held that the complaint sufficiently alleged the existence of an employer-employee relationship by stating the petitioner was merely on "vacation because of illness" [1]. It is well-settled that when a complaint involves the recovery of unpaid wages or overtime pay and an employer-employee relationship still exists, the industrial court has jurisdiction even if the complaint does not include a prayer for reinstatement [1]. The respondent's denial of this relationship is an evidentiary matter to be resolved during a trial on the merits, not on a motion to dismiss [2].

2. **NO.** The action has not prescribed. While the complaint was filed beyond the three-year prescriptive period provided in Section 7-a of Republic Act No. 1993, the Court found that the petitioner had previously filed claims for the same compensation with the Department of Labor on August 8, 1957, and March 18, 1958 [2, 3]. The filing of these claims with the proper administrative office interrupted the running of the prescriptive period [3].

The order appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [4].
