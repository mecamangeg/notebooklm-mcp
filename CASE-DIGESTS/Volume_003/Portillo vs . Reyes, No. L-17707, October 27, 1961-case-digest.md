I. CAPTION
MANUEL F. PORTILLO v. HON. LUIS B. REYES and CESAR RAMIREZ, G.R. No. L-17707, October 27, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Cesar Ramirez filed a civil complaint against Petitioner Manuel Portillo in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. Portillo filed a verified motion to dismiss based on improper venue, averring that his domicile was in Caloocan, Rizal, and that neither he nor the plaintiff resided in Manila [1]. The Respondent Judge denied the motion, accepting the argument that the phrase "or may be found" in Section 1, Rule 5 of the Rules of Court authorized venue in the place where the defendant is actually found [1, 2]. Portillo filed a petition for prohibition to challenge the denial [1, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the phrase "may be found" in the Rules of Court justifies venue in a place where the defendant is found but does not reside, even if the defendant has a known residence in the Philippines.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the phrase "may be found" in Section 1, Rule 5 of the Rules of Court applies only to cases where the defendant has no residence in the Philippines [2]. Citing *Cohen v. Benguet Commercial Co., Ltd.* and *Evangelista v. Santos*, the Court held that as long as the defendant is a resident of the Philippines, the words "residence" and "found" are synonymous terms, meaning "domicile" [4]. Since Petitioner Portillo had a known residence in Caloocan, venue was improperly laid in Manila.

The petition is GRANTED [5].
