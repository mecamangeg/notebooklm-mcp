I. CAPTION
CALIFORNIA LINES, INC. v. AMPARO DE LOS SANTOS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-13254, December 30, 1961, Dizon, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Josephine Regalado filed Civil Case No. 27906 against California Lines, Inc. (CLI) for damages resulting from a bus collision with a vehicle owned by Amparo de los Santos [2]. CLI filed a third-party complaint against De los Santos and her driver to hold them liable for any amount CLI might be ordered to pay Regalado [3, 4]. After Regalado and De los Santos entered an amicable settlement, the trial court issued an order dismissing "this case" [5]. CLI moved to amend the order, and the court specified that the dismissal was "without prejudice" to the third-party complaint [6]. CLI subsequently filed a new action, Civil Case No. 32298, against De los Santos to recover P1,700.00 for bus repairs and P1,435.00 for lost earnings [7, 8]. De los Santos moved to dismiss the new case on the ground of *litis pendentia* (pending action), arguing that the third-party complaint in the first case was still pending adjudication [9]. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint [10].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the second action on the ground of another pending action (*litis pendentia*) was proper. [9, 11]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the order of dismissal must be reversed because Civil Case No. 27906 was definitely terminated in its entirety by the previous orders [11]. An order stating that "this case be dismissed" applies to all claims, counterclaims, and third-party complaints involved [11]. The amendment clarifying that the dismissal of the third-party complaint was "without prejudice" did not keep the case pending but merely preserved the right to refile [11]. Furthermore, the Court found the causes of action were entirely different [12]. The third-party complaint in the first case was for *reimbursement* of damages CLI might pay its passenger, while the second case was for *direct damages* (property damage and lost income) suffered by CLI itself [12]. Thus, there was no action pending between the same parties for the same cause [12].

The order of dismissal appealed from is reversed and set aside, and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [13].
