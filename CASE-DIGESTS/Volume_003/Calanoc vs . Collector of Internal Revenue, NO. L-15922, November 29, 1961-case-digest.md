I. CAPTION
C. F. CALANOC v. THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-15922, November 29, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner C. F. Calanoc promoted a boxing and wrestling exhibition on December 3, 1949, at the Rizal Memorial Stadium for a charitable purpose [1]. He applied for an exemption from amusement tax under Section 260 of the National Internal Revenue Code [2]. The exhibition generated gross sales of P26,553.00, but Calanoc reported expenses of P25,157.62, leaving a net profit of only P1,375.38 which was remitted to the Social Welfare Commission [2, 3].

Upon investigation, the Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) discovered various questionable expenditures, including P461.65 for police protection, P460.00 for gifts, and P1,880.05 for parties [2]. Relying on a Department of Finance order authorizing the denial of exemptions where net proceeds are not substantial or expenses are exorbitant, the CIR denied the exemption and assessed P7,378.57 in amusement taxes [1, 3]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the assessment, ruling that the expenses were excessive or unsupported [1, 4]. Calanoc appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is entitled to an exemption from amusement tax for the charitable exhibition.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the assessment, ruling that the exemption was properly denied. The Court held that an application for exemption from amusement tax will be denied where the net proceeds for charity are not substantial or where the expenses incurred are exorbitant [6].

The Court found the expenses listed by the petitioner to be either exorbitant or unsupported by receipts [4]. Specifically, the Court declared the payment of P461.65 for police protection as illegal, reasoning that it was a consideration given for the performance of functions required by law [4]. Furthermore, expenses for gifts, parties, and representation were deemed excessive considering the charitable nature of the event [4]. The Court also noted that a P1,000 stadium fee paid directly by a concessionaire (O-SO Beverages) was improperly claimed by the petitioner as an expense [4, 5].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED [7].
