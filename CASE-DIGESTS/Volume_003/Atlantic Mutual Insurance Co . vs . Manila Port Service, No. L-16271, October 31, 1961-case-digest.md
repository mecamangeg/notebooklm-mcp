I. CAPTION
ATLANTIC MUTUAL INSURANCE CO. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-16271, October 31, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
The South Sea Trading Corporation of New York shipped goods to South Seas Trading Corporation of Manila on board the "SS Tudor," insured by Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. The vessel arrived in Manila on May 13, 1957, and the shipment was turned over to the Manila Port Service (subsidiary of Manila Railroad Company), the arrastre operator. Three bales of cotton piece goods valued at P5,020.89 were lost, and one case was damaged [1]. Atlantic Mutual paid the consignee and demanded reimbursement from the Manila Port Service [2].

The Manila Port Service invoked Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract between it and the Bureau of Customs, which limits liability to P500.00 per package unless the value is "otherwise specified or manifested." The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Atlantic Mutual but limited the award to P1,500.00 (P500 per missing bale) [2, 3]. Atlantic Mutual appealed, arguing that the consignee was not a party to the Management Contract and should not be bound by its limitations [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the consignee is bound by the liability limitation in the Management Contract between the arrastre operator and the Bureau of Customs.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court. A consignee who takes delivery of a shipment by virtue of a delivery permit becomes bound by the provisions of the Management Contract when said permit incorporates the contract by reference [2].

The Court explained that the delivery permit used by the consignee specifically incorporated Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract, the gist of which was set forth in the permit. Although not a signatory to the contract, the consignee became bound by its stipulations upon using the permit to claim the goods. Furthermore, the consignee could have avoided the P500.00 limit by specifying the true value of the goods in the claim for delivery, which it failed to do. The Court relied on established jurisprudence in *Tomas Grocery vs. Delgado Brothers, Inc.* and *Jose Bernabe & Co. vs. Delgado Brothers, Inc.* [2].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [4].
