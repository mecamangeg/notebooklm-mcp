I. CAPTION
JUANITA R. DOMINGO v. HON. DIONISIO DE LEON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17686, November 29, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
In the Court of Appeals (CA) case *Domingo v. Soriente*, the CA denied the defendant Soriente's motion for reconsideration. The delivery receipt indicated that Soriente's counsel received a copy of the denial resolution on August 15, 1960 [1]. Based on this date, the Clerk of Court made an entry of judgment stating the decision became final and executory on August 16, 1960 [1].

Petitioner Domingo moved to set aside the entry of judgment, arguing that the date was incorrect. She relied on a report by the CA messenger, Benjamin Agustin, which stated that the resolution was actually served on August 12, 1960 [2]. The messenger later claimed in an affidavit that the delivery receipt signed by counsel was post-dated [3]. The CA denied Domingo's motion, giving more weight to the delivery receipt than the messenger's report [2, 4]. Domingo filed this petition for certiorari and mandamus [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the written admission of service (delivery receipt) prevails over the serving officer's report regarding the true date of service.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the delivery receipt constitutes the best evidence of service in this case [4]. Under Section 10, Rule 27 of the Rules of Court, proof of service consists of: (1) the written admission of the party served; or (2) the affidavit of the party serving [4]. The Court noted that the rules list written admission first, implying that the server's affidavit is not necessarily the best evidence or entitled to more weight [6].

While courts must resolve conflicts between proofs based on the specific circumstances, the CA correctly relied on the delivery receipt because it appeared "clean on its face" and devoid of suspicious circumstances [3, 7]. In contrast, the messenger's claim that the receipt was post-dated was not credible because he failed to report the alleged irregularity for almost two months [3]. The Court distinguished this from *De Los Angeles v. Cabahug*, where the receipt was visibly tampered with [7].

Petition dismissed [8].
