I. CAPTION
AMADA LOURDES LERMA GARCIA, ETC. v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16085, November 29, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Amada Lourdes Lerma Garcia, a child born out of wedlock, filed a petition for change of name under Rule 103 of the Rules of Court in the Court of First Instance of Quezon City [1, 2]. She sought to change her surname to "Lugue" to adopt the family name of her natural father, Amado Vargas Lugue [2]. Petitioner claimed her father had recognized her and given permission to use his name, though there was no formal document or judicial proceeding establishing this recognition [3]. The Solicitor General opposed the petition, arguing that if she were truly recognized, she would already have the right to the surname under Article 282 of the New Civil Code, but since judicial approval is required under Article 281, her proper remedy was an action for recognition, not a change of name [4]. The trial court denied the petition [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for change of name under Rule 103 is the proper remedy for a natural child to use the surname of a natural father who has recognized her without judicial approval.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner's remedy is not a petition for change of name but an action for recognition. Under Articles 278 and 281 of the New Civil Code, if a natural child has been recognized by the natural father short of judicial approval, the child must bring an action for recognition to validate this status [5, 6]. Once recognition is legally accomplished, the child automatically avails of the rights granted by law, including the right to bear the surname of the natural father [5, 6]. The Court emphasized that Rule 103 should not be confused with the procedure for recognition [7].

The resolution appealed from is affirmed [7].
