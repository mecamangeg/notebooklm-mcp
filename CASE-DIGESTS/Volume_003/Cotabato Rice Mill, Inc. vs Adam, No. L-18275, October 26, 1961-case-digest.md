I. CAPTION
COTABATO RICE MILL, INC. v. SALAZAR ADAM, G.R. No. L-18275, October 26, 1961, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Cotabato Rice Mill, Inc. filed a civil action for the recovery of a sum of money against defendant Salazar Adam in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cotabato. Adam answered with a counterclaim. However, neither Adam nor his counsel appeared at the trial on October 25, 1960. The CFI heard the case *ex parte* and rendered a decision ordering Adam to pay P2,565.00 plus interest and attorney’s fees [1].

Adam appealed to the Supreme Court. On June 7, 1961, his counsel was notified to file the printed brief within 45 days [2]. The Court granted two extensions; the second extension was granted with a warning that no further extension would be given [2]. On September 9, 1961, after the second extension had already expired, Adam filed a motion for a third extension, assuring the Court that if the brief was not filed by October 5, 1961, the appeal would be considered abandoned [3]. No brief was submitted [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed for failure to file the appellant's brief.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court concluded that the appeal had been abandoned. The Court noted that despite the explicit warning that no further extension would be granted, no appellant's brief was submitted [3, 4]. Furthermore, the Court relied on the appellant's own "assurance" in his final motion that the appeal should be considered withdrawn if the brief was not filed by the specific deadline of October 5, 1961 [3].

Appeal dismissed [5].
