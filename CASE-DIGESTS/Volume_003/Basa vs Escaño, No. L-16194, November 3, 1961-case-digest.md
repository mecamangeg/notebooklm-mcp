I. CAPTION
VICENTE BASA v. ANTONIO V. ESCAÑO, G.R. No. L-16194, November 3, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Vicente Basa, a former employee of Antonio V. Escaño, filed an action in the Municipal Court of Davao City to recover overtime pay, separation pay, and attorney’s fees. The Municipal Court ruled in favor of Basa [1]. Escaño appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao. After an amendment to the complaint to properly name Escaño (instead of his business "Eagle Theater") as the defendant, the CFI also rendered judgment in favor of Basa [1]. Escaño appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which dismissed the case without passing on the merits, ruling that the cause of action fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [1]. Basa filed this petition for certiorari, arguing that the case belongs to the regular courts [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over money claims (overtime and separation pay) where the employer-employee relationship has terminated and no reinstatement is sought.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the Court of Industrial Relations has no jurisdiction over the subject matter [2]. Citing the doctrine laid down in *Price Stabilization Corporation (PRISCO) v. Court of Industrial Relations* (G.R. No. L-13806), the Court held that the CIR only has jurisdiction over claims related to the Minimum Wage Law and Eight-Hour Labor Law when the employer-employee relationship still exists or when reinstatement is sought [3]. Where the relationship has terminated and the employee does not seek reinstatement, such claims become "mere money claims" that fall within the jurisdiction of regular courts [3, 4]. Since Basa was no longer an employee and did not seek reinstatement, the CA erred in dismissing the case [2].

The petition was **GRANTED**, the decision of the Court of Appeals was **REVERSED**, and the case was **REMANDED** to said Court for further proceedings [2].
