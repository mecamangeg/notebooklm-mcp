**I. CAPTION**
MANUEL REGALADO, ET AL. v. THE PROVINCIAL CONSTABULARY COMMANDER OF NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, G.R. No. L-15674, November 29, 1961, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners, who are engaged in the deep-sea fishing business, purchased ice from an ice plant in Bacolod City to be transported to Cadiz, Negros Occidental for their operations. Upon the request of the Public Service Commission (PSC), the respondent Provincial Commander of the Philippine Constabulary prevented the entry of the ice into Cadiz [1]. Petitioners filed an action for injunction with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental against the respondent [1]. The CFI initially issued a writ of preliminary injunction but, after trial, dismissed the case and dissolved the writ, ruling it lacked jurisdiction [1]. Petitioners appealed, arguing the CFI erred in declaring it had no jurisdiction to grant the injunction [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance has the authority to issue an injunction against the Provincial Commander enforcing an order of the Public Service Commission.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the CFI has no authority to issue an injunction against the Public Service Commission or any other court or semi-judicial body of equal rank. Although the injunction was directed against the Provincial Commander, he was merely enforcing an order of the PSC; thus, an injunction against him would effectively be one against the Commission itself [2]. The Court relied on the doctrine established in *Iloilo Commercial vs. Public Service Commission* (56 Phil. 38) [2]. Furthermore, the Court noted the injunction had become practically unnecessary as the SC had already declared the subject PSC order void in a related case (G.R. No. L-15300) [3].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [4].
