I. CAPTION
PEDRO BASAYSAY v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and ELIZALDE PAINT & OIL FACTORY, INC., G.R. No. L-16438, November 29, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pedro Basaysay, a laborer for respondent Elizalde Paint & Oil Factory, Inc., contracted tuberculosis during his employment. He was hospitalized twice (1952-1953 and 1956-1957) and the respondent company paid for his medical expenses and full wages during these periods. He was discharged from service on January 2, 1958. Basaysay filed a claim for further medical expenses incurred after his discharge, arguing his illness was not yet cured.

The Hearing Officer of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) ruled in Basaysay's favor, awarding P2,183.00 for treatment expenses. However, the WCC Associate Commissioner reversed this decision and dismissed the claim, finding that Basaysay's tuberculosis was already arrested on his last day of work. This finding relied principally on the testimony of the company doctor, Dr. Conrado Lorenzo. The Commission *en banc* denied reconsideration. Basaysay appealed to the Supreme Court via certiorari, contending that the WCC should not have given weight to the company doctor's testimony.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court can review the Workmen's Compensation Commission's factual finding regarding the credibility of the witness and the status of the petitioner's illness.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that findings of fact made by the Workmen’s Compensation Commission are generally not subject to review in an appeal by certiorari.

Under Section 46 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act (Act No. 3428, as amended), decisions of the WCC are appealable to the Supreme Court in the same manner as decisions from the Court of Industrial Relations. Such appeals, perfected by a petition for certiorari, may raise "only questions of law" (Rule 44, Rules of Court; *Commonwealth Act No. 103*). Findings of fact will not be reviewed unless there is a grave abuse of discretion resulting from a total absence of competent evidence (*Ang Tibay v. Court of Industrial Relations*).

In this case, the Court found there was competent and substantial evidence—specifically Dr. Lorenzo’s testimony—supporting the WCC's conclusion that the illness was arrested. The petitioner's argument regarding the doctor's credibility involves weighing conflicting evidence, which is beyond the province of the Supreme Court in appeals by certiorari (*Batangas Transportation Co. v. Rivera*).

The decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is affirmed.
