I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST "NEW JERUSALEM", G.R. No. L-15772, October 31, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent, a religious corporation organized under Philippine laws, received a donation of two crates (600 cartons) of Chesterfield cigarettes from a certain Nedra Hansen in New York in May 1958 [1]. The donation was intended for free distribution to the respondent's poor and destitute members [1]. Respondent requested exemption from the payment of specific taxes on the importation, invoking Republic Act No. 1916 [1]. The Secretary of Finance, and subsequently the petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), denied the request on the ground that cigarettes are not articles which, by their nature, are for civic, religious, or charitable purposes [1]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) reversed the CIR's decision and held that the cigarettes were exempt [1]. The CIR filed this petition for review [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the imported cigarettes donated to the respondent religious organization are exempt from specific tax under Republic Act No. 1916.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's decision [2]. Under Republic Act No. 1916, tax exemption requires that: (1) the articles are donated; (2) the donee is a duly established international civic, religious, or charitable organization; and (3) the articles are for the organization's use or for free distribution, not for sale or hire [3]. The Court ruled that the statutory phrase "for civic, religious and charitable purposes" characterizes the *institution* or donee, not the nature of the *articles* imported [4]. The law explicitly covers "all articles" provided they are for free distribution [5].

Although cigarettes are not inherently for charitable purposes, their free distribution to the poor to assuage their needs is a charitable act, similar to donations of comfort goods to soldiers or hospital wards [5, 6]. The law provides safeguards against abuse by imposing double taxes if the donated articles are subsequently transferred for consideration [7]. As the respondent met all legal requirements, the exemption was proper [4].

Decision affirmed [2].
