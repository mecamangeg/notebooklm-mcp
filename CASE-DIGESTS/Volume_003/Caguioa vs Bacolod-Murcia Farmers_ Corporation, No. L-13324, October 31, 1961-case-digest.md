I. CAPTION
MARCELO CAGUIOA, ET AL. v. THE BACOLOD-MURCIA FARMERS’ CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-13324, October 31, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Hieroteo R. Villarosa and other members of the Bacolod-Murcia Farmers’ Corporation filed a petition for Mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental to compel Salvador Pacis, the Permit Agent of the Sugar Quota Administration, to sign their quedan-permits [1]. Pacis refused to sign, citing instructions from the Secretary of Commerce and Industry to recognize a different entity pending a separate civil case [2]. The CFI rendered judgment ordering Pacis to immediately sign the permits and warning him of contempt for disobedience [3]. Following Pacis's failure to comply, the trial judge granted a motion for immediate execution and issued an order directing Marcelo Caguioa, the District Sugar Supervisor, to sign the permits in lieu of Pacis [4]. Caguioa, who was not a party to the original Mandamus case, appeared but failed to sign [5]. Consequently, the CFI ordered the Clerk of Court to sign the permits "For authorized Permit Agent" and required both Pacis and Caguioa to show cause why they should not be punished for contempt [6], [7]. Petitioners filed this action for Certiorari and Prohibition, arguing the judge acted without jurisdiction and abused his discretion by compelling Caguioa, a non-party, to act [7], [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court had jurisdiction to order Caguioa to sign the quedan-permits as a substitute for Pacis and hold him amenable for contempt.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to order Caguioa to act. Under **Section 10, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court**, if a judgment directs a party to perform a specific act and they fail to comply within the specified time, "the court may direct the act to be done at the cost of the disobedient party by some other person appointed by the court" [9]. The duty to sign rested upon the Sugar Quota Administration, whose District Sugar Supervisor was Caguioa and whose Permit Agent was Pacis [10]. Thus, the court could validly order Caguioa, or any other person such as the Clerk of Court, to sign as a substitute when the original party failed to do so [10]. If the appointed substitute disobeys, they are amenable for contempt of court [11].

The petition was **DISMISSED** [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
