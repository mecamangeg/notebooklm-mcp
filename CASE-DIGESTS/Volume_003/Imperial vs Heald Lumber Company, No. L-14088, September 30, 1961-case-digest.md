I. CAPTION
CONCEPCION PELLOSA VDA. DE IMPERIAL v. HEALD LUMBER COMPANY (consolidated with *Hernandez v. Heald Lumber Co.* and *Philippine Air Lines, Inc. v. Heald Lumber Co.*), G.R. Nos. L-14088, L-14089 & L-14112, September 30, 1961, 3 SCRA 178, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On June 4, 1954, a Philippine Air Lines (PAL) helicopter chartered by Lepanto Consolidated Mining Co. crashed in Ampusungan, Benguet, within the lumber concession of respondent Heald Lumber Company [1]. The crash resulted in the deaths of Capt. Gabriel Hernandez (a licensed helicopter pilot) and Lt. Rex Imperial (a licensed plane pilot then training as a helicopter pilot) [1].

The heirs of the deceased pilots and PAL filed separate complaints against Heald Lumber Company for damages [2]. They alleged that the crash was caused by the helicopter colliding with the defendant's tramway steel cables strung between two mountains, and that the defendant was grossly negligent for not declaring these cables as hazards to aerial navigation [3, 4]. The defendant countered that the crash was due to fuel exhaustion and pilot negligence [5]. The Court of First Instance of Baguio dismissed the complaints, finding that the plaintiffs failed to prove negligence on the part of the defendant [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Heald Lumber Company is liable for damages for the helicopter crash.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal, holding that the plaintiffs failed to establish their claims by a preponderance of evidence [6].

The Court found that the crash was not caused by the defendant's cables but rather by the pilot's negligence and lack of fuel. The evidence showed that the helicopter had exceeded its estimated maximum flight endurance by the time of the crash, supporting the conclusion that the engine ceased to function due to fuel exhaustion [7, 8]. Furthermore, evidence suggested that Lt. Imperial, a trainee, was piloting the aircraft at the time, in violation of Civil Aviation Regulations and Section 42(H) of Republic Act No. 776, which prohibits persons without appropriate airman certificates from serving in such capacity [9, 10].

Regarding the tramway cables, the Court ruled they did not constitute a hazard to aerial navigation. The area was described as mountainous and congested with pine trees, making it unsuitable for air navigation; thus, the defendant could not have reasonably foreseen that aircraft would fly low enough to become entangled with the cables [10]. The marks on the rotor blades alleged to be from the cables were inconclusive and could have been caused by hitting a pine tree [11].

The decision of the lower court dismissing the complaints was affirmed [6].
