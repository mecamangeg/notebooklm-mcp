I. CAPTION
ENRIQUE ICASIANO v. FELISA ICASIANO, G.R. No. L-16592, October 27, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Enrique Icasiano filed a complaint against defendant Felisa Icasiano to recover P20,000. Felisa filed an answer admitting some allegations but setting up special defenses and two counterclaims: one for the sum of P150.00 allegedly borrowed by Enrique, and another for damages and attorney's fees [1, 2]. Enrique moved to dismiss the first counterclaim. The Court of First Instance granted the motion and dismissed the counterclaim for lack of jurisdiction [2, 3]. Felisa appealed the order. Enrique moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing the order was interlocutory and the appeal was frivolous, but the trial court allowed the appeal as Enrique had failed to object to the record on appeal initially [2, 4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court has jurisdiction to entertain the counterclaim for P150.00 despite the amount being small.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The trial court has jurisdiction to entertain the counterclaim. The Supreme Court ruled that pursuant to Articles 1278, 1279, 1286, and 1290 of the Civil Code, compensation takes place by operation of law when all requisites are present, extinguishing both debts to the concurrent amount [6, 7]. The defendant would have been entitled to deduct the P150.00 from the plaintiff's P20,000.00 claim if the allegations were true, even if the counterclaim had not been specifically pleaded [7]. The Court emphasized that the counterclaim was set up not merely to obtain a money judgment, but by way of set-off to reduce the sum collectible by the plaintiff [7].

Accordingly, the order appealed from is **REVERSED** insofar as it dismissed the first counterclaim, and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [8].
