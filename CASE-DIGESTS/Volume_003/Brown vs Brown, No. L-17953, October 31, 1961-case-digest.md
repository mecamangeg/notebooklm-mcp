I. CAPTION
LESLIE H. BROWN, represented by his Attorney-in-fact, MANUEL R. DE CARTAGENA, and MANUEL R. DE CARTAGENA, in his own behalf v. SALUD Q. BROWN and HONORABLE JUDGE BIENVENIDO TAN, G.R. No. L-17953, October 31, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On January 13, 1961, respondent Salud Q. Brown filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to be appointed administratrix of the conjugal assets she shared with her husband, petitioner Leslie H. Brown. Salud alleged that Leslie, a Canadian citizen, had abandoned the conjugal home, lived with a mistress, and fled the country in December 1960. She sought to take over the management of their business, "Brown Studios and Photo Supply," from Leslie's appointed manager and attorney-in-fact, Manuel R. de Cartagena.

Summons was issued solely to Cartagena and not to Leslie Brown. Cartagena filed a motion to dismiss, arguing lack of jurisdiction over the person of the defendants. The CFI denied the motion and proceeded to appoint a receiver. Leslie Brown, represented by Cartagena, filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court to set aside the CFI's orders.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the person of the non-resident petitioner by serving summons upon his attorney-in-fact.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court failed to acquire jurisdiction over Leslie H. Brown.

The Court found that Leslie, having escaped to his country, was an absentee or non-resident. For the court to acquire jurisdiction over an absentee in an action *quasi in rem* (affecting property interests), summons must be served in accordance with Section 17, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court (now Rule 14). This requires extraterritorial service via personal service, registered mail, or publication.

The Court ruled that service upon the attorney-in-fact (Cartagena) was insufficient. First, actions must be brought against the real party in interest (Rule 3, Sec. 2), and an *apoderado* is not the real party in interest. Second, no rule allows service of summons upon an agent to bind the principal in this context; service must be made on the non-resident himself. Citing *Banco Español Filipino v. Palanca* and *Perkins v. Dizon*, the Court declared the proceedings below null and void.

The orders of the lower court were **SET ASIDE**, and the case was remanded with instructions that summons be first served upon Leslie H. Brown.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Concepcion, J.** (Concurring in result): Concurred because it did not appear that Cartagena was empowered to accept summons addressed to his principal.
