I. CAPTION
CO KE TONG v. THE DIRECTOR OF PRISONS, G.R. No. L-14957, October 19, 1961, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Co Ke Tong was convicted of estafa by the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila for misappropriating P42,400.00 received from Choa Bei. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, and the petitioner began serving his sentence in 1956 [1-3]. In February 1958, he filed a petition for *habeas corpus* with the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-13471), challenging the trial court's jurisdiction on the ground that the information failed to allege the elements of "deceit" and "intent to gain." The Supreme Court dismissed this petition for lack of merit [4].

In September 1958, petitioner filed a second petition for *habeas corpus* in the CFI of Rizal based on the exact same grounds. The CFI of Rizal denied the petition, ruling that it could not review or revoke an order of a superior court on the same matter. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the second petition for *habeas corpus* should be dismissed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that where the issues raised in a previous case which had been finally decided by the Court are substantially the same as those presented in a second case appealed to the same Court, the latter should be dismissed. The Court invoked its prior resolution in G.R. No. L-13471, noting that the issues raised in the present appeal were substantially the same as those already dismissed for lack of merit [6, 7].

The decision of the Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissing the petition was affirmed [7].
