I. CAPTION
GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and PEDRO OLASE (and vice versa), G.R. Nos. L-17186 & L-17363, October 31, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
In 1953, the GSIS Employees Association declared a strike, resulting in CIR Case No. 896-V. The CIR issued an order prohibiting the dismissal of employees during the pendency of the case. Pedro Olase, a GSIS employee, was subsequently charged with malfeasance (swindling) and dismissed by GSIS after an investigation. In 1957, the Association filed an "incidental motion" in the pending Case No. 896-V seeking Olase's reinstatement. GSIS challenged the CIR's jurisdiction, arguing that Olase's dismissal for malfeasance was unrelated to the strike demands and thus could not be an incident of the pending action. The CIR assumed jurisdiction and ordered Olase's reinstatement because the administrative investigation lacked due process (ex-parte proceedings), but denied backwages finding GSIS acted in good faith. Both GSIS and Olase appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR has jurisdiction over the petition for reinstatement filed as an incidental motion in the pending strike case.
2. W/N Olase is entitled to backwages upon reinstatement.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Although the Supreme Court agreed with GSIS that the order prohibiting dismissals in the pending strike case referred only to dismissals occasioned by the labor demands—and Olase's malfeasance had no connection to those demands—the CIR still had jurisdiction. The Court ruled that even if the petition for reinstatement could not be properly filed as an "incidental motion" in the pending case, it is still cognizable by the CIR simply because the employee is seeking reinstatement. The Court relied on the doctrine in *Prisco v. CIR* (G.R. No. L-13806).

2. **NO.** The Court affirmed the CIR's denial of backwages. While the dismissal was procedurally defective due to the lack of opportunity for Olase to confront his accusers, the CIR found that GSIS acted in good faith and without malice, based on an honest belief in Olase's guilt. The Court held that denying backwages under these circumstances did not constitute an abuse of discretion.

The petitions are **DISMISSED** and the orders appealed from are **AFFIRMED**.
