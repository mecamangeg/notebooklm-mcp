I. CAPTION
NAPOLEON R. MALOLOS v. HON. ANDRES REYES, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-16135, October 19, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Napoleon R. Malolos was convicted of direct contempt by the trial court, presided over by respondent Judge Andres Reyes. The trial court sentenced him to ten (10) days imprisonment and a fine of P100.00. In a decision rendered on February 25, 1961, the Supreme Court affirmed this judgment [1, 2]. Malolos filed a Motion for Reconsideration, pleading for mercy to eliminate the jail sentence. He argued that he had withdrawn the contemptuous statements and apologized to the judge, though the apology was denied. He further cited his good standing as a member of the Bar since 1940, his role as a law professor, and the fact that this was his first incident in his legal practice [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the penalty of imprisonment for direct contempt should be removed based on the petitioner's plea for leniency.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court resolved to accede to the petitioner's plea of leniency and modified the penalty. The Court reasoned that the utterances made by the petitioner were not as serious and derogatory as those made in other similar cases, such as *Lualhati v. Albert*, *Salcedo v. Hernandez*, *In re Sotto*, and *In re Franco*, where the respondents were merely sentenced to pay fines ranging from P100.00 to P200.00 [3]. Additionally, the Court considered the fact that this was the first incident the petitioner had been involved in since he began practicing law [3].

Accordingly, the Court **MODIFIED** its previous decision by eliminating the sentence of imprisonment imposed on the petitioner [3].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Reyes, J.B.L., J., reserved his vote [4].
