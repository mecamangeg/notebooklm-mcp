I. CAPTION
TEODORICO B. SANTOS v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17196, December 28, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Adriano Calisin, et al., employed as agricultural laborers in the 500-hectare hacienda of petitioner Teodorico B. Santos, filed a complaint for unfair labor practice against him in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). They alleged they were dismissed from service on April 5, 1956, for joining the Casaca Peasant Union. Santos moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the complainants were agricultural laborers and thus outside the purview of Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act). The CIR denied the motion, asserted jurisdiction, and rendered a decision finding Santos guilty of unfair labor practice and ordering the reinstatement of the complainants with back wages. Santos petitioned the Supreme Court for review. It is undisputed that the complainants were agricultural laborers at the time of the complaint.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over unfair labor practice claims filed by agricultural laborers.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court of Industrial Relations lacks jurisdiction. An agricultural laborer does not fall within the definition of "employee" under Section 2(d) of Republic Act No. 875 [1]. Consequently, the Industrial Peace Act does not apply to them. Instead, any controversy arising from the relationship between a landlord and a tenant or agricultural laborer falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR), created by Republic Act No. 1267 [1, 2]. The CAR is empowered to settle all disputes involving relationships in the cultivation and use of agricultural land, including the redress of grievances such as unfair labor practices [2]. The decision of the CIR is set aside.
