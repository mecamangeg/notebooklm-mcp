I. CAPTION
*In the Matter of the Petition of Gerardo Yu, alias Mongmong, to be Admitted a Citizen of the Philippines, Gerardo Yu alias Mongmong v. Republic of the Philippines*, G.R. No. L-16517, November 29, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Gerardo Yu, a Chinese subject born in Bohol, filed a petition for naturalization. The Republic opposed the petition, arguing that Yu lacked irreproachable character and probity. Evidence showed that on three separate occasions—in his application for a marriage license and in two subsequent marriage contracts (civil and religious)—Yu falsely declared his citizenship as "Filipino."

Yu admitted to the falsifications but claimed he was a victim of "fixers" who prepared the papers and that he signed them without reading. He further argued that he was ignorant of the procedure. The Court of First Instance of Bohol denied his petition, ruling that these false statements demonstrated a lack of good moral character required for citizenship. Yu appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is qualified to be admitted as a citizen of the Philippines despite making false statements regarding his citizenship in his marriage documents.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that the petitioner is disqualified from becoming a citizen.

The Court held that by stating he was a Filipino citizen in his marriage application, Yu violated Article 66 of the Civil Code (Republic Act No. 386), which expressly requires foreigners desiring to contract marriage to secure a certificate of legal capacity from their diplomatic or consular official. The instructions for this requirement were even printed at the back of the marriage license application.

The Court emphasized that Yu made these false statements on three distinct occasions. Regardless of his motives or his claim of being misled by fixers, such conduct proves he does not possess the "irreproachable character" required by naturalization laws. A foreigner who violates the law and misrepresents his status cannot be considered an asset to the country.

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
