I. CAPTION
CARMEN PLANAS v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-15934, October 31, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In 1950, petitioner Carmen Planas was assessed for war profit taxes. She appealed the assessment to the Board of Tax Appeals (BTA), a body created by Executive Order No. 401-A. On May 29, 1952, the BTA affirmed the assessment but increased the valuation of her jewelry [1, 2]. Planas appealed the BTA decision to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-5866). However, on March 30, 1954, the Supreme Court dismissed her appeal "without prejudice," citing the doctrine in *University of Sto. Tomas v. Board of Tax Appeals*, which held that the executive order creating the BTA was null and void for usurping judicial powers [2, 3].

Subsequently, Republic Act No. 1125 was enacted creating the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). On September 9, 1958, the Solicitor General filed a motion with the CTA for the execution of the 1952 BTA decision against Planas [4]. The CTA granted the motion, theorizing that the case was "pending execution" and thus transferable to the CTA. Planas objected, arguing the BTA decision was void and could not be executed [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Tax Appeals may order the execution of a decision rendered by the defunct Board of Tax Appeals.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the CTA resolution. The Court ruled that the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals was null and void for want of jurisdiction [5, 6].

In *University of Sto. Tomas v. Board of Tax Appeals*, the Court established that E.O. 401-A was unconstitutional, meaning the BTA had no jurisdiction to act on such cases [3]. A decision that is null and void for want of jurisdiction is not a decision in contemplation of law and can never become executory [5].

The Court further explained that Section 21 of R.A. No. 1125 only validated BTA proceedings in two specific instances: (1) cases previously decided by the BTA and pending in the Supreme Court at the time of the Act's approval; and (2) cases pending in the BTA at the time of the Act's approval [3]. The present case fell under neither exception, as the BTA had decided it two years prior to the law, and the Supreme Court appeal had already been dismissed [7]. The previous dismissal of Planas' appeal "without prejudice" necessarily implied that the BTA decision was void and that she reserved the right to question her liability in appropriate proceedings [8].

The resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals is set aside [9].
