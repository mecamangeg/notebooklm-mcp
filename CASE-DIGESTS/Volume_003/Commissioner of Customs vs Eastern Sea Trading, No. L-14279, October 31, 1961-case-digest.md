I. CAPTION
THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS and THE COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS v. EASTERN SEA TRADING, G.R. No. L-14279, October 31, 1961, 3 SCRA 351, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Eastern Sea Trading was the consignee of shipments of onion and garlic from Japan and Hong Kong which arrived in Manila in 1954. The shipments were seized and subjected to forfeiture proceedings by the Collector of Customs for lacking the release certificates required by Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 [1]. The Collector declared the goods forfeited, a decision affirmed by the Petitioner Commissioner of Customs [1, 2].

On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) reversed the Commissioner’s decision [2]. The CTA held that the Central Bank lacked authority to regulate "no-dollar" imports (imports not involving foreign exchange); that the Circulars were void; and that the seizure of goods from Japan was invalid because Executive Order No. 328 implemented an executive agreement with Japan that had not been concurred in by the Senate [2-4]. The Commissioner of Customs petitioned for review [2].

III. ISSUES
1. W/N the Central Bank has the authority to regulate "no-dollar" imports.
2. W/N the executive agreement with Japan is valid despite the lack of Senate concurrence.
3. W/N the Central Bank is authorized to issue import licenses after the abolition of the Import Control Commission.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Central Bank has the authority to regulate no-dollar imports. Under its charter (Republic Act No. 265), the Central Bank has broad powers to maintain monetary stability and preserve the international value of the currency [5]. The Court held that these powers include the authority to regulate no-dollar imports because such imports impact the stability of the peso and its international value [5].

2. **YES.** Executive agreements may be validly entered into without Senate concurrence. While Article VII, Section 10(7) of the 1935 Constitution requires the concurrence of two-thirds of the Senate for "treaties," executive agreements are distinct [4]. International agreements involving adjustments of detail carrying out national policies, such as commercial and temporary arrangements, often take the form of executive agreements [6]. The validity of entering into such agreements without legislative participation has been confirmed by long usage in Philippine history [7].

3. **YES.** The authority to issue import licenses was not vested exclusively in the Import Control Commission. Executive Order No. 328 provided for licenses from the "Central Bank of the Philippines or the Import Control Administration" [8]. The Commission was merely created to implement objectives of the Central Bank; upon its abolition, the duty to provide means for these objectives reverted to the Monetary Board and the Central Bank [8].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **REVERSED**, and the decision of the Commissioner of Customs is affirmed [9].
