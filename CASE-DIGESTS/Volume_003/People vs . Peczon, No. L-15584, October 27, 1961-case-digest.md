I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PACIFICO PECZON, ET AL., accused; PEDRO REBADULLA, ET AL., bondsmen-appellants**, G.R. No. L-15584, October 27, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
A complaint for robbery in band was filed against Pacifico Peczon and others in Samar. Nineteen bondsmen (appellants) posted bail for the accused [1]. Due to the accused's failure to appear for preliminary investigation, the Justice of the Peace Court elevated the case to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Oras, Samar [1]. The CFI set the trial for August 22, 1958, but only 8 of the 19 bondsmen received notice of the hearing [2].

Counsel for the bondsmen, Atty. Rebadulla, advised them that the accused’s presence was not necessary, mistakenly believing the hearing was still for a preliminary investigation which could be waived [2]. Consequently, the accused failed to appear. The trial court ordered their arrest and the confiscation of the bond, giving the bondsmen 30 days to produce the accused and explain [3]. Within the period, the bondsmen moved to lift the confiscation, explaining the counsel's erroneous advice and noting that the accused had already been arrested and jailed by virtue of a previous order [3, 4]. The trial court found the explanation unsatisfactory and rendered judgment against the bondsmen [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court properly ordered the forfeiture and confiscation of the bail bonds.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the lower court [5].

First, regarding the 11 bondsmen who did not receive notice, the Court held they cannot be held liable. Section 15, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court expressly provides that "sureties shall be notified to produce him before the court on a given date" [6]. Without such notice, their bonds cannot be forfeited [7].

Second, regarding the bondsmen who were notified but failed to produce the accused, the Court found they substantially complied with the rules [7]. Upon receipt of the confiscation order, they submitted a written explanation within a reasonable period justifying their failure: it was due to the erroneous advice of counsel regarding the nature of the hearing (preliminary investigation vs. trial) and the fact that the accused were already in custody shortly thereafter [4, 8]. The Court accepted this as sufficient justification to set aside the order of confiscation [8].

The judgment appealed from is **REVERSED** [5].
