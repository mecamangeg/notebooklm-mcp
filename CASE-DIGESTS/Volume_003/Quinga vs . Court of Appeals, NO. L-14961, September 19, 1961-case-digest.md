I. CAPTION
FLORA QUINGA, in her capacity as Administratrix of the Intestate Estate of Ceferino Datoon v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS and FILOMENA SALAS, G.R. No. L-14961, September 19, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Filomena Salas owed Ceferino Datoon P200.00 prior to September 1934 [1]. To settle the debt, Salas signed a deed of absolute sale for Lot No. 7741 on September 18, 1934, on the condition that she would remain in possession and could repurchase the land [1, 2]. Datoon registered the deed and obtained a Transfer Certificate of Title in 1935 [2]. However, Salas remained in possession, and Datoon only began receiving a share of the fruits in 1944, nine years after the alleged sale [3]. After Datoon died in 1943, Salas sought to repurchase the property from the administratrix, Flora Quinga, claiming the balance was only P100.00 [2]. Quinga refused, prompting Salas to file suit [2].

The Court of First Instance held the transaction was an absolute sale and dismissed the complaint [4]. The Court of Appeals reversed, declaring the transaction an equitable mortgage because the price was grossly inadequate and the vendor remained in possession [3, 5, 6]. Quinga appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the contract between the parties is an equitable mortgage rather than an absolute sale.
2. W/N the action to recover the property has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' finding that the real nature of the transaction was an equitable mortgage [3, 7]. Although the contract appeared to be an absolute sale, the price of P200.00 for more than two hectares of riceland was grossly inadequate [3]. Furthermore, the vendor (Salas) remained in possession of the land, and the vendee (Datoon) did not enjoy the fruits of the property until 1944, nearly a decade after the execution of the deed [3, 8]. These circumstances—inadequacy of price and retention of possession—are badges of an equitable mortgage [3, 8].

2. **NO.** The action has not prescribed [9]. Since the property was merely mortgaged and no foreclosure proceedings were instituted, the property remained subject to the mortgage contract [9, 10]. Salas' cause of action only accrued upon Quinga's refusal to accept payment of the debt and discharge the mortgage [10].

**Judgment affirmed.** [11]
