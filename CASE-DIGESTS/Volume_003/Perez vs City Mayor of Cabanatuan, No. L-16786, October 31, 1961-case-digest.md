I. CAPTION
EMILIANO M. PEREZ, as Chief of the Nueva Ecija Provincial Hospital v. THE CITY MAYOR, THE MUNICIPAL BOARD and the CITY TREASURER, all of the City of Cabanatuan, G.R. No. L-16786, October 31, 1961, De Leon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Perez, the Chief of the Nueva Ecija Provincial Hospital, filed a petition for mandamus to compel the respondents (City Mayor, Municipal Board, and Treasurer of Cabanatuan) to appropriate P24,983.12 from the city's general fund for the hospital's support [1, 2]. Perez alleged that under Section 2(a) of Republic Act No. 1939 (Hospital Financing Law), the city was obligated to set aside 7% of its annual general income, but had only appropriated P10,000.00, leaving a deficiency [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija dismissed the petition on the ground that the petitioner was not the real party in interest [2]. Perez appealed directly to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Chief of a Provincial Hospital is the real party in interest to compel a city to appropriate funds under the Hospital Financing Law.
2. W/N the petition for mandamus is premature due to non-exhaustion of administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The petitioner is not the real party in interest [2, 4]. Under Section 7 of the Hospital Financing Law and Department of Health Circular No. 262, the proper administrative remedy for a local government's failure to remit contributions is for the Secretary of Finance—upon recommendation of the Secretary of Health and the Auditor General—to order the withholding of the necessary amount from the city's Internal Revenue allotments [5, 6]. The law does not authorize the hospital chief to bring an action against the city; his role is limited to reporting the failure to his superiors [6].

**YES.** The petition is premature. The Court held that since an appropriate, plain, speedy, and adequate administrative remedy existed (the withholding mechanism by the Finance Secretary), the petitioner should have availed of that first [7]. Recourse to the courts is precluded until all administrative remedies have been exhausted, citing *Peralta vs. Salcedo*, *Panti vs. The Provincial Board of Catanduanes*, and others [7].

The decision of the lower court dismissing the petition is **AFFIRMED** [8].
