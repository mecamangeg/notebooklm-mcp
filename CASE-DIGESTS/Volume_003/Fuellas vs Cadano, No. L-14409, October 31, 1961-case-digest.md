**I. CAPTION**
AGAPITO FUELLAS v. ELPIDIO CADANO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14409, October 31, 1961, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
Pepito Cadano and Rico Fuellas, the son of petitioner Agapito Fuellas, were both 13-year-old classmates at St. Mary’s High School. On September 16, 1954, an altercation occurred where Rico pushed Pepito to the ground, causing Pepito to break his right arm. Two actions were filed: a criminal case against the minor Rico for serious physical injuries, and a civil case for damages against his father, Agapito. The trial court convicted Rico in the criminal case but reserved the civil liability for the separate civil action. In the civil case, the trial court held Agapito liable under Article 2180 of the Civil Code. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision but modified the amount of moral damages. Agapito appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that Article 2180 applies only to quasi-delicts involving fault or negligence, and not to intentional criminal acts committed with discernment, which he claimed should be governed solely by the Revised Penal Code.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a father is liable for damages under Article 2180 of the Civil Code for the intentional criminal acts of his minor son who acted with discernment.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the liability of the father. The Court ruled that the subsidiary liability of parents under Article 2180 of the New Civil Code covers obligations arising from both quasi-delicts and criminal offenses. To hold otherwise—that Article 2180 applies only to negligence and not to criminal intent—would result in the absurdity where a parent is liable for a child's mere carelessness but exempt if the child acts with malice.

The Court cited *Salen v. Balce*, noting that while the Revised Penal Code is silent regarding the subsidiary liability of parents for minors who act *with* discernment (unlike those acting without discernment under Art. 101, RPC), this void is filled by Article 2180 of the Civil Code. The parent's liability is grounded not on *respondeat superior*, but on the relationship of *pater familias*, based ultimately on the parent's own negligence in supervision (*culpa in vigilando*). Agapito failed to prove he exercised the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent the damage.

Petition dismissed; decision affirmed.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Justices Bautista and Barrera took no part).
