**I. CAPTION**
ILOILO CHINESE COMMERCIAL SCHOOL v. LEONORA FABRIGAR and THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-16600, December 27, 1961, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
Santiago Fabrigar worked as a janitor-messenger for the petitioner from 1947 until March 1956. On March 11, 1956, he performed strenuous work preparing for graduation, after which he suffered shortness of breath. Two days later, he spat blood and stopped working. He underwent treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis and heart disease but died on June 28, 1956.

His common-law wife, respondent Leonora Fabrigar, filed a claim for compensation. The WCC Hearing Officer dismissed the claim for lack of proof of causal relation. However, the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed this, ruling that the employment aggravated his illness based on the short interval between his last work day and death. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the preponderance of evidence showed the cause of death was "beriberi adult" (per the death certificate), that the deceased was actually an employee of the Iloilo Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and that the school is not an industry covered by the law.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the WCC erred in applying the rule of substantial evidence rather than preponderance of evidence regarding the compensability of the death.
2. W/N there was an employer-employee relationship between the petitioner and the deceased.
3. W/N the petitioner may raise the defense of being an educational institution exempt from the Workmen's Compensation Law for the first time on appeal.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Workmen’s Compensation Commission, like the Court of Industrial Relations, is bound not by the rule of preponderance of evidence as in ordinary civil cases, but by the rule of substantial evidence (*Ang Tibay v. CIR*). The Court found substantial evidence supported the Commission's finding that the deceased's strenuous work aggravated his pre-existing illness, despite the death certificate stating "beriberi adult," as the certifying sanitary inspector had not examined the deceased.

2. **YES.** The most important test of an employer-employee relation is the power to control the employee’s conduct. The records disclosed that the *encargado* (person in charge) of the respondent school supervised the deceased and controlled the manner in which he performed his work. This establishes the relationship, rejecting the claim that the Chinese Chamber of Commerce was the true employer.

3. **NO.** The factual question of whether the petitioner is an institution devoted solely to learning and not an industry was not properly put in issue before the Commission. Consequently, it cannot be entertained on appeal for the first time (*Atlantic Gulf v. CIR*).

The decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is **AFFIRMED**.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None.
