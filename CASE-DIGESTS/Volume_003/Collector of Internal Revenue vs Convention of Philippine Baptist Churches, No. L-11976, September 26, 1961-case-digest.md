I. CAPTION
COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. ANTONIO PRIETO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-11976, September 26, 1961.

II. FACTS
The Collector of Internal Revenue (Petitioner) filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding a Supreme Court decision that held the Collector liable for interest on improperly collected taxes. The case stemmed from the Collector's assessment of inheritance taxes against Antonio Prieto and other heirs (Respondents). The Collector insisted on taxing the full value of the properties allotted to each heir under a project of partition, without deducting the cash payments the heirs were required to pay to their co-heirs to equalize their shares, as ordained in the will of the deceased Doña Teresa Tuason y de la Paz [1]. The Respondents argued that the actual share received was the property value minus these cash payments. The Petitioner contended that under the ruling in *St. Paul’s Hospital of Iloilo v. Collector of Internal Revenue*, no interest should be due as the collection was not arbitrary [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Collector of Internal Revenue is liable for interest on the improperly collected inheritance taxes.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the Collector of Internal Revenue is liable for interest at the legal rate on taxes improperly collected when the collection is attended with arbitrariness or is clearly unjustified [3]. The Court affirmed the doctrine in *Carcar Electric & Ice Plant Co., Inc. v. Collector of Internal Revenue* [4].

The Court distinguished the present case from *St. Paul’s Hospital of Iloilo*, where the taxability of sales in a hospital pharmacy was a "fairly debatable issue," and thus the collection was not arbitrary [1]. In this case, the Collector had "no reason" to insist on collecting inheritance tax on the gross value of allotted properties without deducting the cash payments made to equalize the shares [1]. Because the collection was "clearly unjustified," the *Carcar* ruling applies, and the Collector must pay interest [1].

Petitioner’s motion for reconsideration is **DENIED** [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes (J.B.L.), Paredes, and De Leon concurred with the resolution [5].
