**I. CAPTION**
MANUEL LAO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17055, October 27, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Manuel Lao filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Leyte. He was born in Maasin, Leyte, and had resided there since birth. However, he lived with Illuminada Lora without the benefit of marriage, fathering four children with her. He only married her in a civil ceremony on April 18, 1958, just four days before filing his petition for naturalization [1, 2]. The trial court granted the petition on March 2, 1959, ruling that Lao spoke and wrote English well and *presuming* that he spoke Cebuano-Visayan simply because he was born and lived in Maasin [3, 4]. The Republic appealed, questioning his moral character and the sufficiency of evidence regarding the language requirement [2, 3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petitioner satisfied the requirement of ability to speak and write a native dialect.
2. W/N the petitioner conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during his residence in the Philippines.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the ability to speak and write a native dialect is a qualification required by law that must be established by clear evidence and cannot be merely presumed from a person's birthplace or length of residence [5, 6]. It is not uncommon for individuals to live in a place for a long time without learning the local dialect. Moreover, the law requires the ability to both speak *and* write the dialect; in this case, the record was completely blank regarding the petitioner's ability to write Cebuano-Visayan [6].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner failed to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner. Living illicitly with a woman and raising an illegitimate family during his residence runs counter to the customs, idiosyncrasies, and moral standards of the Philippines, which abhors illicit relations [1, 7]. Formalizing his status via civil ceremony only four days before filing his petition did not cure this defect [1, 2].

The decision of the lower court granting the petition is REVERSED.
