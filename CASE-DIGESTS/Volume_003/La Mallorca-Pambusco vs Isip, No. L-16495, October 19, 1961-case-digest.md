I. CAPTION
LA MALLORCA-PAMBUSCO v. CIRILO ISIP, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16495, October 19, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Cirilo Isip, a driver for petitioner La Mallorca-Pambusco, contracted tuberculosis in 1955. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded him P1,302.95 for past medical expenses, P2,665.70 for disability, and weekly compensation capped at P4,000.00, plus further medical services until cured. Isip signed a "Satisfaction of Award" upon receiving P5,302.95, which included a stipulation reserving his right to "further hospital or medical treatment, whenever necessary."

When Isip required further treatment, the WCC issued orders on June 11, 1959, and November 20, 1959, requiring the petitioner to pay additional medical expenses. On December 28, 1959, the WCC issued a writ of execution to enforce payment. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that the medical award exceeded the statutory limit and that the WCC lacked jurisdiction to issue writs of execution.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the employee is entitled to medical expenses in excess of the P4,000.00 limit on compensation.
2. W/N the Workmen's Compensation Commission has the authority to issue a writ of execution.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the statutory limitation of P4,000.00 under the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 3428, as amended) applies only to compensation for disability (Secs. 12, 14, 16, and 18) and not to medical attendance. Medical attendance is governed by a different provision, Section 13, which requires the employer to provide services "during the subsequent period of disability" as the sickness may require. Furthermore, the "Satisfaction of Award" signed by Isip expressly qualified that the settlement excluded future necessary medical treatment.

2. **NO.** Relying on *Pastoral v. The Commissioners of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission* (G.R. No. L-12903), the Court held that the WCC has no authority to issue writs of execution. While Reorganization Plan No. 20-A attempted to amend Section 51 of the Workmen's Compensation Law to grant such power, it is unconstitutional. Granting the WCC the power to execute judgments diminishes the jurisdiction and judicial power vested in courts of record. The proper procedure is for the interested party to file a certified copy of the WCC decision in a court of record, which will then issue a judgment and the corresponding writ of execution.

Petition to annul the WCC orders for medical payment is DENIED; petition to annul the writ of execution is GRANTED.
