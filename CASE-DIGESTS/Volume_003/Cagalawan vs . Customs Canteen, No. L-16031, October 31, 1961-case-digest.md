I. CAPTION
CONCORDIA CAGALAWAN v. CUSTOMS CANTEEN, FRANCISCO YU and RAMONA PASTORAL, G.R. No. L-16031, October 31, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On December 24, 1957, petitioner Concordia Cagalawan filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao against respondents for underpayment, overtime pay, separation pay, and damages. She alleged she was employed as a waitress and was dismissed in June 1957 without just cause or notice after a personal quarrel with a co-worker. She prayed for reinstatement and back wages. Respondents moved to dismiss, arguing that the CFI lacked jurisdiction over money claims, which they contended belonged to the Regional Office No. 8 of the Department of Labor. The CFI dismissed the case, ruling the amount was less than its jurisdictional minimum (P2,000) and suggested the plaintiff elevate the case to the Labor Standards Commission. Cagalawan appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved a question of jurisdiction regarding Reorganization Plan No. 20-A.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over claims for separation pay, overtime pay, and underpayment filed after the termination of the employer-employee relationship.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the order of dismissal and remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings.

The Court reiterated that the provision of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A granting regional offices exclusive jurisdiction over money claims is null and void [1]. Furthermore, the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) is limited to specific instances, such as labor disputes causing strikes, minimum wage controversies, or Unfair Labor Practices (ULP), usually requiring an existing employer-employee relationship [2].

In this case, the employment relationship had already terminated. While the petitioner prayed for reinstatement, she did not allege any ULP; the dismissal arose from a personal disagreement, not union activity [3]. Absent a ULP charge, the CIR lacks the power to order reinstatement or back wages [4]. Therefore, the claims for separation pay and overtime compensation are treated as simple money claims for breach of a private obligation, which are cognizable by the regular courts of justice [5], [4]. The Court of Appeals determined that the amount involved was within the jurisdiction of the CFI [4].
