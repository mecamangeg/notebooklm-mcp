I. CAPTION
O’RACCA BUILDING TENANTS ASSOCIATION, INC. v. FILOMENO C. KINTANAR, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16826, November 30, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
The O'Racca Building, an enemy alien property, was administered by the Board of Liquidators (Board). Under Republic Act No. 997 (Reorganization Plan 7-A) and Executive Order No. 290, the function of administering government properties was to be transferred to the Department of General Services (Department) [1]. However, pending the actual implementation of this transfer, the Office of the President issued a directive on October 20, 1958, authorizing the Board to lease the building to Catalina de la Cruz Rodil [2]. On October 26, 1959, the Board notified the O’Racca Building Tenants Association (Petitioner) that the building had been leased to Rodil and directed them to pay rentals to her [2].

Petitioner filed a petition styled as "declaratory relief with prohibition and preliminary injunction" with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, questioning the Board's authority and seeking to enjoin the lease [3, 4]. The CFI dismissed the petition on December 19, 1959 [5]. Petitioner received the order on December 24, 1959, but only filed a motion for reconsideration on January 18, 1960 [6]. The CFI denied the motion, and Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for declaratory relief should be treated as an action for prohibition.
2. W/N the appeal was filed within the reglementary period.
3. W/N the Board of Liquidators retained the authority to lease the property despite the Reorganization Plan transferring its functions to the Department of General Services.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Although captioned as a petition for declaratory relief, the inclusion of a prayer for an injunction to stop the enforcement of the lease makes it equivalent to an action for prohibition against public officers. The essence of the action was to prevent the execution of the lease to Rodil, not merely to resolve a legal uncertainty [4]. The Court cited *Feliciano v. Alipio* to support this characterization [4].

2. **NO.** Since the case is effectively one for prohibition, the appeal should have been taken within 15 days from notice of the decision pursuant to Section 17, Rule 41 [6]. Petitioner received the dismissal order on December 24, 1959, but filed its motion for reconsideration 25 days later, on January 18, 1960 [6]. Consequently, the order had already become final [6].

3. **YES.** The transfer of functions under Reorganization Plan 7-A was not self-executing. Section 6(e) of R.A. 997 and Section 43 of E.O. 290 expressly provided that affected agencies shall continue to function until the reorganization details are implemented [7, 8]. The President's directive authorizing the Board to lease the property was a valid reaffirmation of this continuity [9]. Furthermore, as Head of the Executive Branch, the President may modify or revoke his directives at any time provided no law is infringed (*Ollada v. Sec. of Finance*) [9].

The appeal is dismissed [10].
