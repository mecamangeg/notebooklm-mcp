I. CAPTION
FELICISIMA ORIA, In her behalf and in behalf of her Minor son, GIL MARAVILLA v. BASILIO MARAVILLA, JR., G.R. No. L-16308, November 29, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Felicisima Oria, on behalf of herself and her minor son Gil, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental against Basilio Maravilla, Jr. for damages, compulsory recognition, and support [1]. She alleged that she had carnal knowledge of the defendant, resulting in the birth of Gil, and demanded moral damages of P10,000.00 alongside support [1]. The CFI dismissed the complaint, finding Felicisima’s testimony unreliable [1, 2]. Oria appealed directly to the Supreme Court, assigning errors regarding the trial court’s appreciation of evidence, specifically questioning the lower court's failure to hold that certain sexual acts were impliedly admitted, that a defense witness was biased, and that a specific letter (Exh. "A") was genuine [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to resolve the appeal given the nature of the errors assigned.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the appellants were actually raising issues of fact rather than questions of law [4, 5]. The assignments of error involved the determination of witness credibility, the weight of evidence regarding sexual intercourse, and the genuineness of handwriting in contested documents [3, 6]. The Court ruled that in view of the nature of the case and the amount involved, the determination of these questions properly falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals [5].

Accordingly, the case was **REMANDED** to the Court of Appeals for adjudication [7].
