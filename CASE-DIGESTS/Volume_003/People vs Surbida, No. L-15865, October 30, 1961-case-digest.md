**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MARDONIO SURBIDA, G.R. No. L-15865, October 30, 1961, Bengzon, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
On August 5, 1957, Mardonio Surbida, a minor of 14 years, attacked Juanito Salvador with a *batangas* knife in Gonzaga, Cagayan. Surbida was charged with Frustrated Homicide under an information alleging that he acted "with intent to kill" and "wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously." Assisted by counsel, Surbida pleaded guilty before the Court of First Instance. The trial judge, noting Surbida was between 9 and 15 years old, ordered his confinement at Welfareville until he reached the age of majority. Surbida later secured new counsel and filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the court erred in not receiving evidence to determine if he acted with discernment, given his age. The motion was denied, and Surbida appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a minor between 9 and 15 years old may be convicted without positive proof of discernment based solely on a plea of guilty to an information alleging criminal intent.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. Citing *People v. Nieto* (G.R. No. L-11965), the Court held that when a minor pleads guilty to an information alleging that he acted "with intent to kill" and "wilfully, criminally and feloniously," he may be convicted without the need for positive proof of discernment [1].

The Court reasoned that these legal terms signify more than just knowing right from wrong; they connote that the accused committed the act with the intention to kill and with the knowledge that such an act is a crime [1]. The plea of guilty admits these material allegations. Furthermore, the defense presented no evidence or affidavit to dispute the minor's mental capacity or understanding of the consequences of his act [2].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Justices Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, and De Leon concurred) [2].
