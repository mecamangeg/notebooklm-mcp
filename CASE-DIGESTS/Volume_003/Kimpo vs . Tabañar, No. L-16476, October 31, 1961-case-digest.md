I. CAPTION
LEONCIO KIMPO v. NEMESIO T. TABAÑAR, G.R. No. L-16476, October 31, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Leoncio Kimpo filed a complaint alleging ownership and possession since 1925 of a 60-hectare parcel of land in Makato, Capiz [1]. In 1946, he permitted defendant Nemesio Tabañar to temporarily occupy 5 hectares [2]. However, in 1953, Tabañar allegedly converted 25 hectares into a fishpond and destroyed improvements [2]. Tabañar filed an answer claiming he was an applicant for a fishpond permit on the land, asserting it was a disestablished communal forest [3]. The Director of Forestry intervened, claiming the land was public forest [3].

Tabañar moved to dismiss the civil case, citing a pending administrative case between the parties in the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DANR) regarding the same land [4]. He argued Kimpo was estopped from claiming private ownership and had failed to exhaust administrative remedies [4]. The Court of First Instance of Aklan granted the motion to dismiss [4]. Kimpo appealed, arguing the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies did not apply [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the complaint should be dismissed due to the pending administrative case and the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Supreme Court reversed the dismissal. The Court held that the grounds for the motion were not indubitable [6].

First, the rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies is inapplicable to a party who claims the land in dispute as his private property (*Baladjay v. Castrillo, Geukeko v. Araneta*) [5]. Kimpo consistently asserted title in fee simple and is therefore not estopped from denying that the land is public [5].

Second, even in cases involving public lands, courts of justice have the power to decree the restoration of possession to one who has been illegally divested thereof or is being unlawfully deprived of his right to such possession (*Lopez v. Santiago, Lequigan v. Katalbas*) [5].

Third, the Court noted that the records did not clearly show the identity of parties and issues; Kimpo alleged that the administrative case involved additional parties and a larger land area, which Tabañar did not deny [5].

The Order appealed from is reversed and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [6].
