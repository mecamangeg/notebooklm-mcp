I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BENITO CRUZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-11870, October 16, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Appellants Benito Cruz, Paterno Cruz, and Fermin Tolentino were members of the *Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan* (HMB), the armed force of the Communist Party of the Philippines. They were charged with the "complex crime of rebellion, with multiple murder, robberies and arsons."

The prosecution established that Benito and Paterno Cruz participated in a raid on the Hardie Farm in Antipolo, Rizal on March 20, 1951, where they stole property and killed John Hardie, his wife, and their foreman. Fermin Tolentino, identified as "Commander Caviteño," participated in Huk raids in Bataan and the burning of Camp Makabulos in Tarlac between 1948 and 1951.

The Court of First Instance of Rizal convicted Benito and Paterno of "rebellion with robbery with homicide" and Fermin of "rebellion with arson, with murder and robbery," sentencing them to life imprisonment. The appellants challenged the sufficiency of evidence and validity of their confessions.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appellants are liable for the complex crime of rebellion with murder, robbery, and arson.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The appellants are guilty only of **simple rebellion**.

The Court reasoned that where the information alleges, and the records show, that the acts of arson, robbery, and murder were performed as a means to commit the crime of rebellion and in furtherance thereof, the crime committed is simple rebellion. The Court applied the doctrine in *People v. Hernandez* and *People v. Nava*, holding that common crimes committed in furtherance of the political offense are absorbed in the rebellion.

Accordingly, the decision was **MODIFIED**. Benito Cruz and Fermin Tolentino, being Huk Commanders, were sentenced to ten (10) years of *prisión mayor* and a fine of P10,000 each under Article 135, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code. Paterno Cruz, as a member, was sentenced to six (6) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of *prisión mayor* under Article 135, paragraph 2.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Padilla, J., dissenting:** Maintained his view from *People v. Geronimo* that common crimes should be complexed with rebellion.
