I. CAPTION
KOPPEL (PHILIPPINES), INC., petitioner-appellant, vs. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, respondent-appellee, G.R. No. L-10550, September 19, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Koppel (Philippines), Inc. sustained war losses during the Japanese occupation, which it initially recorded as accounts receivable from the U.S. Government. Upon learning in 1947 that 25% of the claim would not be recovered, Koppel wrote off the amount of P256,054.88 as bad debts in its 1947 books. The Respondent Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) disallowed this deduction and assessed a deficiency income tax of P34,636.21. Koppel paid this amount under protest on June 29, 1949 [1].

Koppel repeatedly sought reconsideration and refund. While the Secretary of Finance initially issued a ruling in 1951 favorable to similar claims, this was revoked by his successor in 1953. Consequently, Koppel's claim was denied on July 28, 1953 [1]. Koppel filed a petition with the Board of Tax Appeals on August 27, 1953, and later appealed to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-5701), which dismissed the appeal "without prejudice" on April 29, 1954. Koppel then filed a complaint for refund with the Court of First Instance of Manila on May 18, 1954, which was remanded to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [2]. The CTA dismissed the case on the ground that the cause of action had prescribed under Section 306 of the National Internal Revenue Code [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's action for tax refund is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals. Section 306 of the National Internal Revenue Code mandates that no suit for the recovery of taxes erroneously or illegally collected shall be begun after the expiration of two years from the date of payment of the tax [4]. Here, the tax was paid on June 29, 1949, while the judicial action was effectively commenced only on May 18, 1954, clearly beyond the two-year period [1, 2].

The Court rejected the petitioner's argument that it relied on the government's delay and favorable circulars. Citing *Kiener Co., Ltd. v. S. David*, the Court held that the two-year prescriptive period is not extended by the Collector's delay in giving notice of the rejection of the claim [5]. A taxpayer should not wait for the Collector's decision but must file the action within the statutory period; the filing of a claim with the Collector is merely intended as notice [5]. Furthermore, the government is never estopped by error or mistake on the part of its agents [6]. The petition was denied, and the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals was affirmed [7].
