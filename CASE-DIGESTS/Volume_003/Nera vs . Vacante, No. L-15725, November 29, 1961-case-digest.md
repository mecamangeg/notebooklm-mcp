I. CAPTION
PAULINO V. NERA v. FELIPE L. VACANTE and SANTIAGO P. DAKUDAO, G.R. No. L-15725, November 29, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On October 17, 1956, Santiago Dakudao (vendor) and Paulino Nera (vendee) entered into a contract to sell seven parcels of land. The contract stipulated that a violation of its terms would render it null and void, forfeit prior payments as rentals, and authorize Dakudao to take possession without a court order [1], [2]. Nera failed to pay the installment due on June 30, 1958 [3].

Dakudao filed a complaint for "detainer" in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Lambunao, Iloilo, alleging that Nera's failure to pay rendered his possession unlawful [1], [3]. Nera filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the JP Court lacked jurisdiction because the case involved the rescission of a contract, which is not a detainer issue [4]. The JP Court denied the motion [5]. Nera then filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo [5]. The CFI ruled in favor of Nera, holding that the JP Court lacked jurisdiction to hear cases involving rescission or annulment of contracts [6], [7]. Dakudao appealed to the Supreme Court [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Justice of the Peace Court has jurisdiction over a detainer suit premised on the violation of a contract to sell.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the CFI.

The Court ruled that while a violation of a contract to sell entitles the other party to rescind it, a Justice of the Peace Court cannot declare a contract resolved or rescinded, as it is beyond its power to do so [9]. In this case, the illegality of Nera's possession was premised upon the resolution of the contract [10], [9]. Since the JP Court cannot take cognizance of the rescission, it cannot determine the resulting unlawfulness of the possession [9].

Furthermore, the Court held that a stipulation entitling a party to take possession upon violation of the contract does not *ex proprio vigore* (by its own force) confer the right to take possession if the other party objects; judicial intervention is required to determine the rescission [11], [12].

Judgment affirmed [12].
