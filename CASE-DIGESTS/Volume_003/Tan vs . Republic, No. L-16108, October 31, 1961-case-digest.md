I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF REGARDING CIVIL STATUS, ELEUTERIA FELISETA TAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16108, October 31, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Eleuteria Feliseta Tan filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental, claiming to be a Filipino citizen as the illegitimate child of a Chinese father and a Filipino mother. She alleged that she and her nine minor children were mistakenly registered as aliens. After the Commissioner of Immigration refused to cancel their Alien Certificates of Registration (ACR), she sought judicial relief. Upon the lower court's suggestion, she amended her petition into one for declaratory relief to declare her citizenship. The Solicitor General opposed, arguing that no proceeding exists for a judicial declaration of citizenship. The trial court ruled in favor of Tan, declaring her a Filipino citizen and ordering the cancellation of the ACRs. The Republic appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for declaratory relief is the proper remedy to seek a judicial declaration of citizenship and the cancellation of an Alien Certificate of Registration.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that declaratory relief is a special civil action that lies only when a person interested under a deed, will, contract, or statute demands a construction thereof to determine their rights, which was not the case here.

Moreover, under Philippine laws, there is no action or proceeding for the judicial declaration of the citizenship of an individual. Courts exist to settle justiciable controversies, and a pronouncement regarding a person's status (such as citizenship) can only be made as an incident to the adjudication of rights in such a controversy, not as the principal relief sought. The Court reiterated that while citizenship may be a material issue in a competent court action, a direct declaration cannot be obtained because there is no proceeding provided by law for such purpose (*Tan v. Republic*, G.R. No. L-14159). Consequently, the judgment was set aside and the petition was dismissed.
