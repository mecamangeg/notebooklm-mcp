I. CAPTION
TESTATE ESTATE OF NARCISO A. PADILLA, deceased. ISABEL B. VDA. DE PADILLA, executrix-appellant, vs. CONCEPCION PATERNO, administratrix-appellee, G.R. No. L-8748, December 26, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Narciso A. Padilla died in 1934, leaving his mother, Isabel B. Vda. de Padilla (executrix), and his widow, Concepcion Paterno (administratrix). In previous appeals (G.R. No. 48137 and G.R. No. L-4130), the Supreme Court settled the classification of the estate’s properties. Some were declared paraphernal (exclusive property of the widow), while others were originally paraphernal but deemed conjugal subject to reimbursement for improvements. However, improvements on certain lots (Arquiza and Juan Luna) were destroyed during the 1945 liberation of Manila before reimbursement could occur.

In 1954, Concepcion’s estate moved for an accounting of the rentals and income from her paraphernal properties collected by the executrix during the administration (1938-1953) and for the delivery of her share in the "Illusion Theater" improvements on the R. Hidalgo property. Isabel opposed, arguing the properties were conjugal and that the claim was barred by prior judgments ("law of the case"). The probate court ordered the accounting and appraisal. Isabel appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the widow is entitled to the exclusive income of the properties declared paraphernal accrued during the period of administration.
2. W/N the widow is entitled to an additional share in the value of the improvements on the R. Hidalgo property.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The widow is the sole owner of the income from properties that remained paraphernal. Under the "law of the case" established in the previous G.R. No. L-4130 (upholding the "Rufino Report"), properties where conjugal improvements were destroyed before reimbursement (Arquiza and Juan Luna) never became conjugal; they reverted to the widow's estate. Consequently, all income accrued from these properties (and others confirmed as paraphernal) during administration belongs exclusively to the widow, minus administration expenses.

However, for properties that *did* become conjugal upon reimbursement (e.g., Lot 6-B Camba), the conversion retroacts to the date the obligation was constituted under Art. 1187 of the New Civil Code. Fruits from these specific properties after the dissolution of the partnership belong to the mother and widow in co-ownership. Since they had already divided this income equally, no new accounting is required for this class of property.

2. **YES.** The widow’s estate is entitled to an additional share in the R. Hidalgo improvements. The earlier appraisal in the "Rufino Report" did not include the value of the "Illusion Theater" because, at that time, the improvements belonged to a lessee. The improvements accrued to the estate only after the lease expired. Therefore, the lower court correctly ordered a new determination of the widow's share in this additional value.

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** with the clarification that the accounting of income applies only to the specific paraphernal properties identified.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
