I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ISABELO ALMIREZ and ISABELO PRINCIPE, G.R. Nos. L-16109 & L-16110, October 20, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On the afternoon of August 8, 1955, in Barrio Bato, Mauban, Quezon, Delfin Ursolino and the deceased, Crispin Santamena, were working in a coconut plantation [1]. Three armed men—Moises Impreso, and herein appellants Isabelo Principe and Isabelo Almirez—arrived. Impreso ordered Principe to hack Santamena while Almirez stood guard [1]. Principe inflicted multiple wounds on Santamena, including a fatal blow to the neck [1].

Ursolino witnessed the crime but did not immediately disclose the identities of the killers to the police or the victim’s wife due to fear of reprisal from the Huks [2, 3]. He only revealed their names after the appellants were arrested or had surrendered [3]. The appellants, identified as Huks, denied participation and interposed the defense of alibi [4, 5]. Appellant Principe further argued that he had been previously convicted of rebellion and that this murder, committed in furtherance of the Huk movement, should be absorbed in the rebellion charge pursuant to *People v. Geronimo* [6, 7]. The Court of First Instance of Quezon convicted both appellants of murder [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the eyewitness's failure to immediately disclose the names of the killers due to fear of reprisal destroys his credibility.
2. W/N the crime of murder should be absorbed into the crime of rebellion.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the witness's failure to disclose the names of the killers immediately was justified by his fear of reprisal from the Huks [2, 3]. This silence is natural and consistent with the fact that he divulged the identities immediately after the appellants were in custody [3]. The Court found his testimony positive, direct, and credible, overcoming the defense of alibi which is weak against positive identification [9].

2. **NO.** Although the appellants were Huks and the victim was accused by them of being a spy, the defense failed to prove that the killing was actually committed in furtherance of the Huk movement [7, 10]. The victim emphatically denied the imputation of spying before he died, and the appellants themselves relied on alibi rather than claiming the act was a political offense [10, 11]. Consequently, the doctrine in *People v. Geronimo* regarding the absorption of common crimes into rebellion does not apply.

The judgment of conviction and sentence imposed are **AFFIRMED** [12, 13].
