I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. VIRGILIO CABRAL y CONSTANTINO and JOSUE JAULA y ALEJANDRINO, G.R. No. L-14045, October 28, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On July 28, 1957, Ligaya Mansiluñgan and her three-year-old son boarded a jeepney driven by appellant Josue Jaula in Manila. Instead of stopping when Ligaya requested, Jaula diverted the vehicle while his co-accused, Virgilio Cabral, threatened the victims with a knife [1]. They were transported to Bulacan and Nueva Ecija, where they were boxed, threatened with death, and divested of a watch, merchandise, and cash [2]. The victims were released only after Ligaya promised to pay P1,000 the following day. Jaula claimed alibi, asserting he was repairing the jeepney, but the trial court rejected this due to Ligaya's positive identification and the finding that his evidence (a receipt) was tampered [3], [4]. The Court of First Instance convicted Jaula of kidnapping or serious illegal detention. Although the presence of the aggravating circumstance of use of a motor vehicle warranted the death penalty, the trial court imposed only *reclusion perpetua*, reasoning that the maximum penalty was "too severe" given the victim's release [5]. Cabral withdrew his appeal, leaving Jaula as the sole appellant [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appellant is guilty of kidnapping or serious illegal detention of a female and a minor.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The crime committed is kidnapping or serious illegal detention of a female and a minor under Article 267, clauses 3 and 4 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended [6]. The commission of the offense was attended by the aggravating circumstance of use of a motor vehicle without any mitigating circumstance to offset it [6].

The Court noted that under the law, the proper penalty is death. The trial court erred in imposing *reclusion perpetua* merely because it felt the strict enforcement of the law was "too severe." Pursuant to Article 5 of the Revised Penal Code, if a court deems a penalty clearly excessive, it must still impose the penalty prescribed by law and recommend commutation to the Chief Executive [6]. However, due to the lack of sufficient votes to impose the death penalty, the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* was affirmed [7]. The indemnity was modified to P161.00 [7].
