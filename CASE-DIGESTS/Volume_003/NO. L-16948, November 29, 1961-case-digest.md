**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MAMERTO CALLANTA *alias* PEDING, G.R. No. L-16948, November 29, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Defendant-appellant Mamerto Callanta appealed a decision of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan to the Supreme Court. In his brief, Callanta’s counsel argued that the trial court erred in appreciating the evidence and giving credence to the testimonies of witnesses Felix Basalio, Eulogio Basalio, and Paterno Palaylay regarding the identity of the accused [1]. Specifically, the defense questioned the trial court's reliance on the testimony of Palaylay, who was of tender age, and Felix Basalio, who was 100 years old [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the appeal was properly taken to the Supreme Court given the errors assigned by the appellant.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the errors assigned by the appellant involved the appreciation of evidence or the credibility of witnesses, which by their very nature involve questions of fact [2, 3]. The Court ruled that the appeal was erroneously taken to the Supreme Court, as such questions fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals [4].

Accordingly, the case was **CERTIFIED** to the Court of Appeals for proper adjudication [5].
