**I. CAPTION**
MAURICIO GORDULAN v. CESAREO GORDULAN, G.R. No. L-17722, October 9, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Mauricio Gordulan filed a suit for the recovery of land (Civil Case No. 2488) against Cesareo Gordulan in the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija. Although duly summoned, Cesareo failed to file his answer within the reglementary period. Consequently, he was declared in default, and after the reception of plaintiff's evidence, judgment was rendered against him.

Cesareo filed a petition for relief from judgment under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court, claiming he had a valid defense (co-ownership of the land) and that his failure to answer was due to the excusable negligence of his counsel, Atty. Antero Tomas. The trial court denied the petition, noting that the counsel's negligence was not excusable, no affidavit explaining the negligence was submitted by the lawyer, and Cesareo failed to inquire about the case status despite residing less than an hour away from the court. Cesareo appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved only questions of law.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petition for relief from judgment should be granted based on the alleged excusable negligence of counsel.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order denying the petition.

The Court held that Rule 38 is a special remedy with conditions *sine qua non* for its allowance. Sections 2 and 3 of Rule 38 require not only a sworn statement of a good and substantial defense but also a showing that the failure to file an answer was due to fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence. While Cesareo provided a sworn statement regarding his defense of co-ownership, he failed to demonstrate that his lawyer's failure to join issues was the result of fraud, mistake, accident, or excusable negligence.

Furthermore, the Court reiterated the doctrine that a client is bound by the acts, including the mistakes and negligence, of his counsel in the realm of procedural technique. Cesareo's remedy is to seek redress against his erring lawyer for the wrong suffered, citing *Isaac vs. Mendoza* (G.R. No. L-2820).

**WHEREFORE**, the order appealed from is affirmed, with costs against appellant.
