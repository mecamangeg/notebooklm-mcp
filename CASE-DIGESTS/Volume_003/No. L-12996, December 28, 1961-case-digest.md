I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ANTONIO ALBERT, G.R. No. L-12996, December 28, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On February 28, 1952, defendant Antonio Albert filed his income tax return for 1951 [1]. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) found a deficiency of P6,889.00, primarily disallowing deductions Albert claimed for expenses incurred attending international conferences [1, 2]. Albert protested the assessment, but the BIR overruled his protest on June 21, 1955 [1]. Albert failed to appeal this denial to the Court of Tax Appeals [3]. Consequently, on February 4, 1957, the Republic filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to collect the deficiency [4]. The CFI ruled in favor of the Republic, holding that Albert was estopped from questioning the assessment because he failed to appeal to the tax court, making the assessment final [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the taxpayer is barred from questioning the validity of the tax assessment in a civil action for collection.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that upon receiving the denial of his protest on June 21, 1955, Albert had 30 days to appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals in accordance with Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125 [3, 5]. His failure to do so rendered the assessment final, executory, and demandable [3]. Therefore, when the government filed the collection case, Albert was already barred from invoking any defense that would reopen the question of his tax liability on the merits [3]. Citing *Republic v. Magalona*, the Court reasoned that allowing a taxpayer to question the assessment during collection proceedings would nullify the finality of the assessment mandated by law [5, 6].

The appealed decision is affirmed [7].
