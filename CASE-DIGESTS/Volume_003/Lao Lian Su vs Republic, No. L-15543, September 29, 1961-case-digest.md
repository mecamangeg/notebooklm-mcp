**I. CAPTION**
LAO LIAN SU alias LORENZO TING v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-15543, September 29, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Lao Lian Su, alias Lorenzo Ting, filed an application for Philippine citizenship. In his sworn petition and testimony, he stated that he had only three children with his wife [1]. However, in his verified income tax returns for the years 1951 to 1957, which he ratified under oath, he claimed exemptions for a fourth child named Ting Kock King [1]. Petitioner offered no explanation for this discrepancy during the proceedings [1]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal denied the application, ruling that the petitioner failed to observe irreproachable conduct in his relations with constituted authorities [2]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner is qualified for admission to Philippine citizenship despite the inconsistency between his petition and income tax returns.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the denial of the petition. The Court reasoned that the unexplained contradictory statements under oath regarding the number of his children lead to the conclusion that the petitioner either tried to evade lawful taxes by claiming an extra exemption or concealed the truth in his naturalization application [1]. Either alternative is sufficient to disqualify him for admission to Philippine citizenship, as it indicates a failure to maintain the required moral character and irreproachable conduct [1, 3].

**Disposition:** The decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant [3].
