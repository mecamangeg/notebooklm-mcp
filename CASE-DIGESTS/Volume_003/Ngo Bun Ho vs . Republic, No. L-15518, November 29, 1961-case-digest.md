I. CAPTION
NGO BUN HO, alias GUICA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-15518, November 29, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Ngo Bun Ho, a Chinese citizen born in 1908, arrived in the Philippines in 1919 and resided in Marawi City for over 30 years [1]. He owns a store from which he derives an annual income of P3,000.00 [1]. He has seven children dependent on him for support, all of whom attend private schools [1, 2]. During the hearing, it was revealed that he was delinquent in the payment of his liquor license tax in 1957 and had violated the Minimum Wage Law, although these cases were later compromised or amicably settled [3]. The Court of First Instance of Lanao admitted him to Philippine citizenship [1]. The Republic appealed the decision [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the petitioner conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during his residence in the Philippines.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** An annual income of P3,000.00 is not considered lucrative under Section 2(4) of the Revised Naturalization Law, considering the petitioner has himself and seven dependent children to support, all of whom are attending private schools [2, 4]. The Court relied on established jurisprudence such as *Lo Chicombing v. Republic* and *Swee Din Tan v. Republic* regarding the financial capacity required for naturalization [2].

2. **NO.** The petitioner failed to satisfy the requirement of Section 2(3) of the Revised Naturalization Law to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner [3]. His delinquency in paying the liquor license tax and his violation of the Minimum Wage Law demonstrate improper conduct [3, 5]. The Court held that the fact that the delinquency was compromised and the violation amicably settled does not cure the defect in his conduct regarding his relations with the constituted government and the community [3, 5].

The decision of the trial court is **REVERSED** and set aside, and the petition for naturalization is **DENIED** [6].
