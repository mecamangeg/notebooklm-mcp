I. CAPTION
JUSTO BALETE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17332, November 29, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Justo Balete filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Rizal to correct entries in the Civil Registry of Manila regarding the birth certificates of his children. Specifically, he sought to change details regarding his own personal circumstances, including: (1) his citizenship from "Chinese" or "Chinese Mestizo" to "Filipino"; (2) his birthplace from "China" or "Manila" to "Malolos, Bulacan"; (3) his religion; and (4) the removal of his alias "Cu Bun Jin" [1-3]. The Solicitor General and the City Fiscal opposed the petition, moving to dismiss on the ground that the changes involved citizenship and other controversial matters which are not proper in a summary proceeding [4]. The lower court issued an order (dismissing the petition/ruling against petitioner), which Balete appealed [1, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N substantial corrections regarding citizenship, status, and residence can be made through a summary proceeding for the correction of entries in the civil registry.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court’s order. The Court ruled that the changes petitioner intended to introduce—specifically regarding citizenship, residence, and aliases—were not merely clerical but substantial in nature, as they affected the status and citizenship of the petitioner [3, 6]. Citing the doctrine in *Ty Kong Tin v. Republic*, the Court held that the summary procedure contemplated in Article 412 of the Civil Code only authorizes the correction of innocuous or clerical errors (e.g., misspellings) [3, 7]. Substantial changes affecting the civil status or nationality of a person cannot be granted in such a proceeding but must be threshed out in a proper and separate action depending on the nature of the issue involved [7, 8].

Accordingly, the order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [5].
