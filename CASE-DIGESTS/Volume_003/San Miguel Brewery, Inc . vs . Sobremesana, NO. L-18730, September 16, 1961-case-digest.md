**I. CAPTION**
SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC., petitioner, vs. REGINO SOBREMESANA and WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, respondents, G.R. No. L-18730, September 16, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Regino Sobremesana, a truck driver for petitioner San Miguel Brewery, Inc., filed a claim for workmen’s compensation on June 23, 1959, with Regional Office No. 4 of the Department of Labor [1]. He claimed his pulmonary tuberculosis was aggravated by his employment conditions [1]. On October 25, 1960, the hearing officer ruled in favor of Sobremesana, ordering the petitioner to pay compensation [1]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that under the Supreme Court's ruling in *Corominas v. Labor Standard Commission*, Reorganization Plan 20-A is null and void insofar as it vests Regional Offices with original and exclusive jurisdiction to decide labor claims, including workmen's compensation [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Regional Offices of the Department of Labor have jurisdiction to hear and decide workmen’s compensation claims under Reorganization Plan 20-A.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Regional Offices have jurisdiction. The Supreme Court clarified that its previous ruling in *Corominas* did not annul the authority of Regional Offices regarding workmen’s compensation claims [2]. Citing *Miller v. Mardo*, the Court held that Reorganization Plan 20-A is invalid only insofar as it confers judicial power over cases *other* than those falling under the Workmen’s Compensation Law [3].

The Department of Labor already exercised jurisdiction over workmen’s compensation claims prior to the reorganization [3]. Section 25 of Plan 20-A merely reallocated powers already possessed by the Department, in conformity with Republic Act No. 997 as amended by Republic Act No. 1241 [3]. The Court distinguished this from the power to issue writs of execution; citing *Pastoral v. Workmen’s Compensation Commission*, it noted that the Commission cannot issue writs of execution as that power is conferred upon courts of record by Section 51 of the Workmen’s Compensation Law [4]. As the award was supported by adequate evidence and the presumption of compensability under Section 44 of Act No. 3428, the petition was **DISMISSED** [5].
