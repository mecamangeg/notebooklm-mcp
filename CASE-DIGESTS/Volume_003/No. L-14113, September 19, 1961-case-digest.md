I. CAPTION
JOSEPHINE COTTON, as guardian of the minor GENEVIEVE CYNTHIA BALTAO v. HON. NATIVIDAD ALMEDA-LOPEZ and EUGENIO S. BALTAO, G.R. No. L-14113, September 19, 1961, Natividad, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cotton and respondent Baltao entered into a compromise agreement in a civil case regarding support and property administration. The agreement, approved by respondent Judge Almeda-Lopez on August 31, 1956, required Baltao to administer properties and submit receipts of payments every six months. On November 19, 1957, Cotton filed a motion for execution, alleging Baltao failed to submit the required receipts. Baltao opposed the motion and subsequently submitted the receipts in January 1958. The respondent Judge denied the motion for execution, ruling that Baltao had substantially complied with the agreement. Cotton filed a petition for mandamus with the Court of Appeals to compel the Judge to issue a writ of execution, arguing the issuance was a ministerial duty. The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N mandamus lies to compel the issuance of a writ of execution for a judgment based on a compromise agreement that requires the performance of conditions.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The rule that a judgment upon a compromise agreement is immediately executory (*Reyes v. de Ugarte*) applies only when the judgment is complete and certain. Where the judgment is indefinite or requires the performance of a condition, the court must first determine whether said condition has been complied with before a writ of execution can issue. Judgments by consent partake of the nature of contracts and must be enforced as such (*49 C.J.S. 314*). The trial court's determination of whether the conditions were fulfilled calls for the exercise of judgment and discretion; whatever error it commits in this determination is an error in the exercise of jurisdiction correctible by appeal, not by mandamus (*Castro v. Surtida*).

Judgment affirmed.
