I. CAPTION
COMMUNITY SAWMILL COMPANY v. THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF ORIENTAL MINDORO and RESTITUTO MINGO, G.R. No. L-17937, December 28, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Restituto Mingo filed a claim for compensation against Community Sawmill Company for a work-related disability. On November 19, 1956, the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded Mingo P1,950.71 [1]. Community Sawmill petitioned the Supreme Court to review the award (G.R. No. L-16246), but the petition was dismissed on November 25, 1959 [1]. Subsequently, Mingo filed a petition with the WCC for a writ of execution, which the WCC issued on October 27, 1960 [1, 2]. Community Sawmill filed the present petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction to restrain the Provincial Sheriff from levying its properties, arguing that the WCC lacked jurisdiction to issue writs of execution under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Workmen’s Compensation Commission has the power to issue a writ of execution to enforce its awards.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The WCC does not have the power to issue writs of execution. The Court reiterated the ruling in *Pastoral v. The Commissioners of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission*, holding that the enforcement of an award in workmen’s compensation cases involves judicial discretion and power explicitly granted to the courts under Section 51 of Act No. 3428 (Workmen’s Compensation Law) [4]. Reorganization Plan No. 20-A could not validly transfer this power to the WCC, as doing so would diminish the jurisdiction and judicial functions vested by law in courts of record [5]. The power to execute a judgment is essentially judicial and must be exercised by a judicial tribunal, not an administrative body like the WCC [5].

Consequently, the petition is granted, and the writ of preliminary injunction restraining the sheriff from enforcing the WCC's writ of execution is declared final [6].
