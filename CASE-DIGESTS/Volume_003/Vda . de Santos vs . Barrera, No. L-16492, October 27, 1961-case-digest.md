I. CAPTION
MARIA SALAO VDA. DE SANTOS v. ESTELITA G. BARRERA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16492, October 27, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Maria Salao Vda. de Santos (employer) engaged the services of three housemaids through the Gloria Employment Agency, owned by Estelita Barrera and others. Santos paid the Agency P154.50 for office and tax fees, and P176.00 to cover the maids' personal debts advanced by the Agency. On September 11, 1957, the maids escaped. The Agency located them and returned them to Santos, but she refused to re-employ them. Santos demanded a refund of the total P390.50 she paid. The Municipal Court of Manila ordered the Agency to pay P390.00 plus attorney's fees. On appeal, the Court of First Instance affirmed the decision. The Agency appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the employer is entitled to a full refund of the office fees paid to the employment agency.
2. W/N the employment agency is liable to reimburse the amounts paid by the employer for the maids' personal obligations.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The employer is only entitled to a partial refund in accordance with the schedule provided in the Code of Rules and Regulations of the National Employment Service. Under Sections 53 and 54, if a recruit terminates employment without dismissal (as was the case when they escaped and were not re-employed), the employer is entitled to a refund based on the duration of service. Applying the schedule, Santos is entitled to only P62.50. Tax fees are not refundable as they are due to the government.

2. **NO.** The amount paid by the employer for the maids' personal obligations is chargeable only against the maids, who personally assumed to pay it in their employment contracts. The Agency is not subsidiarily liable. The receipts issued by the Agency expressly stipulated that "In case of escape the Agency does not guarantee the accounts of the servant-employee."

**Decision modified.** Appellants are ordered to pay appellee only the amount of P62.50, without pronouncement as to costs or attorney's fees.
