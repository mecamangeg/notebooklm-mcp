I. CAPTION
THE MUNICIPALITY OF LUCBAN v. NATIONAL WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY, G.R. No. L-15525, October 11, 1961, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In 1919, the Municipality of Lucban (plaintiff) constructed its waterworks system using loans and aid from the Insular Government and municipal funds [1]. Since its completion in 1921, the Municipality exclusively managed and controlled the system, known as the Apolinario de la Cruz Waterworks System, and collected revenues regulated by its municipal council [1, 2]. The Municipality fully paid its initial loans and obtained a certificate of public convenience in 1954 [1, 3]. Following the enactment of Republic Act No. 1383, which mandated the transfer of all municipal waterworks to the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA), the Municipality passed a resolution refusing the transfer [2]. However, the Municipal Treasurer unilaterally transferred the system's assets to NAWASA [2]. The Municipality filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon City to declare the relevant provisions of R.A. 1383 unconstitutional [4]. The CFI ruled in favor of the Municipality, holding that the waterworks was patrimonial property and could not be taken without just compensation [5, 6]. NAWASA appealed, arguing the system was public property subject to state police power [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the waterworks system is patrimonial property of the Municipality.
2. W/N Republic Act No. 1383 is constitutional insofar as it transfers ownership of the waterworks to NAWASA.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The waterworks system is patrimonial property of the Municipality. Adopting the ruling in *City of Baguio v. NAWASA* and *City of Cebu v. NAWASA*, the Court held that the system serves only those of the general public who pay the required rental or charge [7]. Consequently, the operation of the system is a proprietary or business function, distinct from governmental functions, and is not subject to the unrestricted control of the Legislature [5, 7].

2. **NO.** Republic Act No. 1383 is unconstitutional insofar as it vests on NAWASA ownership of the waterworks system of municipalities without compensation [8]. While the State may acquire patrimonial property through the exercise of eminent domain, it must provide just compensation [5]. The Act violated the Constitution because it did not provide for effective payment, offering only a credit in the form of a "book entry" rather than money [5, 9]. The State's police power cannot be a substitute for the requirements of eminent domain to acquire property without compensation [5].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED [10].
