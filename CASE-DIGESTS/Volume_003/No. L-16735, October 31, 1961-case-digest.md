**I. CAPTION**
FRUCTUOSO ALQUESA, et al., vs. BLAS G. CAVADA, JR., Justice of the Peace of Pinamungahan, Cebu, and VENANCIO L. DAGALA, G.R. No. L-16735, October 31, 1961, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
On July 29, 1957, respondent Venancio L. Dagala filed a complaint for forcible entry against petitioners Fructuoso Alquesa, et al. in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Pinamungahan, Cebu. The JP Court rendered judgment against petitioners on August 24, 1957 [1]. Petitioners initially filed a motion to set aside the judgment alleging fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence, but withdrew it on September 10, 1957, to file a notice of appeal instead [1]. The appeal was perfected and docketed in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu [1].

However, on October 7, 1957, petitioners withdrew their appeal. The next day, October 8, 1957, they filed a petition for relief from judgment under Rule 38 in the same CFI case [2]. The CFI denied the petition on November 10, 1957, ruling that Rule 38 was inapplicable because the remedy of appeal had been available and was actually interposed, though subsequently withdrawn [2]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the CFI should have set aside the JP Court decision for lack of jurisdiction over some petitioners who were allegedly not summoned [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the remedy of a petition for relief from judgment under Rule 38 is available to the petitioners who had previously withdrawn their perfected appeal.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CFI's order. A petition for relief under Rule 38 is an equitable remedy available only in exceptional cases and cannot be used when another remedy at law, such as an appeal, is available [4].

The Court cited *Fajardo v. Bayona*, holding that it is a "vicious practice" for a party to first pursue a legal remedy (appeal) and later abandon it to prosecute a remedy in equity (relief from judgment) [5]. Since petitioners had the opportunity to appeal and in fact perfected one, they are precluded from availing of Rule 38 [6].

Furthermore, the Court noted that the petition was procedurally defective. Under Section 3 of Rule 38, a petition must be accompanied by affidavits showing the fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence *and* the facts constituting the petitioner's good and substantial cause of action or defense [3]. The petitioners' affidavit failed to state any facts regarding their cause of action or defense [3].

**Order affirmed.**
