I. CAPTION
LUZON LABOR UNION v. LUZON BROKERAGE COMPANY, G.R. No. L-17086, November 30, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On December 13, 1941, the General Manager of Luzon Brokerage Company posted a notice regarding urgent U.S. Army transportation needs. Consequently, many employees went to Bataan to transport troops and cargo, relying on the manager's verbal promises of backpay [1, 2]. The Union filed a claim with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) for these workers. The CIR initially found a contract existed but dismissed the claim on the ground of prescription [2, 3]. On the first appeal (G.R. No. L-6608), the Supreme Court reversed the prescription ruling and remanded the case for a new trial specifically to determine awards for the claimants [4].

In the new trial, the CIR ordered payment for 239 claimants who served in Bataan but refused to recognize the claims of 180 other members who remained in Manila and did not go to Bataan, as well as specific individuals (Padilla, et al.) found not to have served there [5, 6]. The Union filed this petition for review, arguing the 180 claimants should be included based on the company's promises [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 180 claimants who did not go to Bataan are entitled to backpay.
2. W/N the Supreme Court can review the CIR's factual findings regarding specific claimants (Padilla, et al.).

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the right of the 180 employees was waived and barred by the scope of the previous proceedings. The original petition and stipulation of facts were strictly limited to mechanics and drivers who went to Bataan and rendered services to the U.S. Army; they did not mention those who remained in Manila [7, 8]. Although the Union attempted to include these claims in a motion for reconsideration/new trial which was denied, this denial was never raised in the first appeal (G.R. No. L-6608) [9]. Consequently, the right of said employees must be considered waived by the failure to appeal that specific denial [9, 10]. Furthermore, the Supreme Court's order for a new trial was limited to determining the amounts for the claimants who actually served in Bataan [11].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the issue regarding whether specific individuals (Padilla, et al.) served in Bataan is factual. The Supreme Court is without authority to reverse the findings of fact made by the Court of Industrial Relations [12].

The decision of the Court of Industrial Relations is affirmed [12].
