I. CAPTION
FILEMON AGUILAR v. VALERIANO MIRANDA, G.R. No. L-16510, November 29, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On September 22, 1944, respondent Valeriano Miranda borrowed P15,000.00 in Japanese military notes from petitioner Filemon Aguilar. The loan was secured by a real estate mortgage on a parcel of land in Las Piñas, Rizal. The contract stipulated that the loan was payable after four years ("pagkatapos makalampas ang APAT (4) NA TAON") from execution [1].

After the redemption period expired without payment, Aguilar filed a complaint for foreclosure in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal [2]. The CFI rendered judgment ordering Miranda to pay P15,000.00 in Philippine currency. Miranda appealed directly to the Supreme Court, arguing that since the loan was contracted in Japanese military notes, it should be repaid based on the Ballantyne schedule of values rather than peso-for-peso [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the loan contracted in Japanese military notes, with a maturity date falling after liberation, must be paid peso-for-peso in Philippine currency.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's ruling. The Court held that when an obligation incurred during the Japanese occupation is expressly agreed to be payable after a fixed period, and the maturity falls after liberation, the promissor must pay in Philippine currency the same amount stated in the obligation (peso-for-peso) [3].

The Court distinguished this from obligations payable "within" a period covering the occupation, where payment could be made anytime. Here, the stipulation was "after four years" from September 1944, meaning the obligation matured in 1948, after the war. The Court rejected the appellant's argument that there must be an express stipulation to pay in the prevailing currency. Citing *Gomez v. Tabia* and *Roño v. Gomez*, the Court ruled that if maturity falls after liberation, the obligation is payable in the currency prevailing at the time of payment, even if the agreement is silent on the matter [4].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Dissenting:** Padilla, J. dissented based on the reasons set forth in his opinion in *Ponce de Leon vs. Santiago Syjuco, Inc.* [5].
