I. CAPTION
LORETA LERIO v. CONRADO ALVAREZ, G.R. No. L-16582, November 29, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On March 30, 1958, Loreta Lerio filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental against Conrado Alvarez for moral damages and support [1]. She alleged that while employed by Alvarez, a married man, he had carnal knowledge of her, resulting in the birth of a child, Bonifacio Alvarez [1]. Alvarez denied the allegations, contending that Lerio had illicit relations with a male house-help, Amador Laurico, and that he did not acknowledge the child [2].

The trial court dismissed the complaint, ruling that Lerio's uncorroborated testimony was insufficient and that the baptismal certificate presented was incompetent to prove paternity [3]. Lerio appealed to the Supreme Court, assigning errors challenging the trial court’s findings on witness credibility and the weight of the evidence [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that in contesting the trial court’s finding regarding the alleged insufficiency of evidence, the appellants were actually raising questions of fact [5, 6]. Challenges to the lower court's appreciation of witness credibility and evidentiary weight are factual in nature. Consequently, the appeal properly falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, not the Supreme Court [5, 6].

The case was remanded to the Court of Appeals for adjudication [6].
