I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE INTERNATIONAL SURETY CO., INC. v. FAUSTO GONZALES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15868, October 31, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In March 1954, Fausto Gonzales (principal) and Philippine International Surety Co., Inc. (surety) executed a promissory note for P500.00 in favor of Equitable Banking Corporation [1]. To secure the surety, Gonzales, appellant Servando de los Angeles, Pablo Galang, and Leon Macose executed an indemnity agreement, binding themselves jointly and severally to reimburse the surety [1, 2]. When Gonzales failed to pay the note at maturity, the bank collected from the surety, who then demanded reimbursement from the indemnitors [1]. Upon their failure to pay, the surety filed a collection suit in the Municipal Court of Manila [3]. The Municipal Court rendered judgment against Gonzales and de los Angeles but dismissed the case against Galang and Macose as they could not be served with summons [3]. De los Angeles appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI), arguing he was denied due process in the Municipal Court because the trial allegedly proceeded in his absence [4]. The CFI affirmed the lower court's decision [5]. De los Angeles appealed to the Supreme Court, contending the CFI should have remanded the case for trial *de novo* and that the surety could not sue him to the exclusion of the other guarantors [4, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the case should be remanded due to an alleged denial of due process in the Municipal Court.
2. W/N the surety can enforce the entire obligation against de los Angeles alone, excluding other co-guarantors.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the appellant was not denied due process. The Court observed that in the motion for new trial filed by the appellant in the Municipal Court, he failed to allege that he had been denied his day in court [7]. This omission negates his contention on appeal [8, 9]. Furthermore, by basing his motion for new trial on grounds other than the alleged denial of his day in court, he impliedly waived his right thereto [9]. The appellant admitted the execution of the indemnity agreement and the non-payment, offering no evidence to offset the plaintiff's allegations [9].

2. **YES.** The surety validly sued de los Angeles alone. The Court ruled that the obligation assumed by the appellant and his co-guarantors under the indemnity agreement was **joint and several** [6, 8]. Under Articles 1216 and 1217 of the Civil Code, a creditor may proceed against any one of the solidary debtors for the whole obligation [2]. The appellant is answerable for the whole amount, with the right to seek contribution from his co-debtors or file a third-party complaint against them, which he failed to do [2, 10].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [11].
