I. CAPTION
GREGORIO APELARIO v. INES CHAVEZ & COMPANY, LTD. and INES CHAVEZ, G.R. No. L-17721, October 16, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On April 8, 1959, Gregorio Apelario filed a complaint against Ines Chavez & Company, Ltd. and Ines Chavez for the collection of P2,400.00 representing the unpaid price of ten axle assemblies purchased on credit. The defendants had issued postdated checks for payment, but these were dishonored for lack of funds. They replaced them with new postdated checks, which were also dishonored.

In their Answer, the defendants admitted the existence of the debt and its non-payment. However, they pleaded the excuse that they requested Apelario to wait because they had not yet collected on their own accounts receivable. They also denied knowledge of the stipulated attorney's fees and denied the allegations of fraud used to support Apelario's writ of attachment.

On Apelario's motion, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered judgment on the pleadings, ordering defendants to pay the principal amount plus interest and P500.00 in attorney's fees. The defendants appealed, arguing that judgment on the pleadings was improper because their Answer raised material issues.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court correctly rendered judgment on the pleadings.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision, holding that the defendants' Answer failed to tender a genuine issue.

First, the defendants admitted all material allegations regarding the debt and non-payment. Their excuse—that they were waiting to collect their own receivables—is not a valid legal defense, as a creditor is not an underwriter of the debtor's business and a debtor cannot delay payment merely to suit their convenience [1].

Second, the denial regarding stipulated attorney's fees did not raise a material issue because the court has the discretion to award reasonable attorney's fees as damages when just and equitable under **Article 2208 of the Civil Code** [2]. The award was justified given that the defendants issued bad checks twice [2].

Finally, the denial regarding the fraudulent removal of property was irrelevant to the judgment on the pleadings because the defendants did not claim or ask for damages resulting from the issuance of the writ of attachment [3].

**WHEREFORE**, the appealed judgment of the Court of First Instance is affirmed. Costs against appellants.
