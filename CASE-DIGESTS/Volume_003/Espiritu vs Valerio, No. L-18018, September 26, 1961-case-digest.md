I. CAPTION
ESPERANZA ESPIRITU, ET AL. v. FRANCISCO VALERIO, G.R. No. L-18018, September 26, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On May 2, 1961, the counsel for the petitioners (appellants) sent copies of their brief via registered mail to Atty. C. Navi Busto, the counsel for the respondent (appellee), at his address of record in Sison, Pangasinan [1]. The package was returned unclaimed because Atty. Busto had moved his residence to Calapan, Mindoro Oriental earlier that year without updating his address of record [1, 2]. Atty. Busto later filed a verified petition stating he only obtained a copy of the brief on August 1, 1961, and requested a twenty-day extension to file the appellee's brief [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appellee may be allowed to file a brief beyond the reglementary period despite his counsel's negligence in failing to update his address of record.

IV. RULING
**YES.** While the Supreme Court found the appellee's counsel negligent for not recording his new address, it ruled to allow the filing [3]. The Court reasoned that because the counsel represents the appellee, and no substantial prejudice would be caused to the appellants by allowing the brief, the extension should be permitted [3, 4]. The petition for extension was granted, with a warning to counsel that a repetition of such negligence would be dealt with more severely [3].
