**I. CAPTION**
SOLOMON B. FLORES v. TEOFISTO M. CORDOVA, G.R. No. L-15071, September 26, 1961, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
On March 11, 1952, petitioner Solomon B. Flores was appointed as a temporary third-class patrolman of Bacolod City by then Mayor Felix B. Amante [1]. On August 15, 1956, he was dismissed and replaced by Pacifico Flores [1]. Flores filed a petition for mandamus, claiming preferential rights to appointment in the government service as a world war veteran. The Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros ruled in his favor, ordering respondent Mayor Teofisto M. Cordova to reinstate him with back salaries [1]. Cordova appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N petitioner Flores is entitled to reinstatement based on his preferential right as a war veteran.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court ruled that to enjoy the preferential right to appointment in the government service, a veteran must comply with three requisites: (1) obtain a certificate regarding his status as a veteran from the Philippine Veterans Board; (2) have previously qualified in an appropriate Civil Service examination; and (3) have filed an application for preference with the Commissioner of Civil Service, citing *Galon v. Cordova* [2].

While Flores established that he was a veteran, he failed to show compliance with the other requisites [3]. The Court further applied the doctrine in *Amora v. Bibera*, holding that a veteran who is not a civil service eligible and holds office temporarily may be validly removed and replaced by a civil service eligible [3].

The appealed decision is **REVERSED** and the petition for mandamus is **DISMISSED** [4].
