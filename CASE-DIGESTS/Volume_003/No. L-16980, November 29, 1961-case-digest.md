I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF ARSENIO G. PE TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, ARSENIO G. PE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16980, November 29, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Arsenio G. Pe filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Antique. During the proceedings, his own character witness testified that Pe owned a public utility passenger truck. The witness later amended his testimony, claiming the truck belonged to Pe’s father and Pe only managed it. Pe denied both versions, asserting the truck belonged to a third party. The trial court found that the truck was owned by either Pe or his father and noted Pe's admission that he knew alien ownership of a public utility violated the Public Service Act. The trial court denied the petition. Pe appealed, arguing the court erred in its findings and that the government did not file a written opposition.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner to qualify for naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the denial of the petition. The Court held that the petitioner's ownership and operation of a public utility vehicle, being an alien, is a violation of the Public Service Act [1, 2]. This violation constitutes evidence that he has not conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner in his relations with the constituted government as well as with the community in which he is living, which is a requirement under Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 [3].

The Court emphasized that in naturalization cases, the burden is on the applicant to prove by competent evidence that he has all qualifications and no disqualifications; in case of doubt, the law is construed strictly against the applicant [4]. Additionally, the Court found Pe failed to prove he had a lucrative trade or profession, as his income declarations were dubious and unsupported by tax returns from years prior to his application [5]. Finally, the Court ruled it may *motu proprio* deny an application if the evidence fails to prove requirements have been met, even without written opposition from the government [4].

The judgment appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [6].
