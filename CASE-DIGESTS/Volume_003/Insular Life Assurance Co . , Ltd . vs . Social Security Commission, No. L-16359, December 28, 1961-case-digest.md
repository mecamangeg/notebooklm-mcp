I. CAPTION
THE INSULAR LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY, LTD., as employer of Agustin O. Benitez v. SOCIAL SECURITY COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-16359, December 28, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. objected to Circular No. 21 of the respondent Social Security Commission, which required employers to remit contributions for employees on leave of absence without pay [1]. Specifically, Insular Life requested a refund of P36.14, representing premiums paid for its employee, Agustin O. Benitez, for the period of May 15 to August 30, 1959, while Benitez was on leave without pay [2]. The Commission denied the request in Resolution No. 890, holding that the obligation to contribute continues as long as the employment relationship exists [2-4]. Insular Life appealed, arguing that compensation is the basis for computation, and thus, no liability exists without compensation [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the employer is liable to pay Social Security contributions for an employee who is on leave without pay.
2. W/N Circular No. 21 is invalid for lack of Presidential approval and publication.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that payment of contributions is compulsory during coverage, which is determined solely by the existence of an employer-employee relationship, not by the actual payment of compensation [6]. While an employee is on leave without pay, the employment contract is not terminated, and the employer is still bound to accept the employee upon return [6]. Consequently, the employer remains liable for contributions. The Court cited *Roman Archbishop of Manila v. Social Security System*, rejecting the petitioner's reliance on the U.S. case *Magruder v. Yellow Cab Co.*, noting that the Philippine system treats contributions as premiums for membership rather than taxes on wages [6, 7].

2. **NO.** The Court held that Circular No. 21 is not an administrative rule or regulation requiring the President's approval or publication in the Official Gazette [8]. It is merely an interpretation and implementation of the clear mandate of the Social Security Act (Sections 9, 11, 22, and 28), which imposes the obligation to contribute as long as the employer-employee relationship exists [8].

The Resolutions of the Social Security Commission are declared legal and valid [9].
