I. CAPTION
EUFROSINO L. RAMOS v. EUGENIO P. MICULOB, Adm. Case No. 504, November 29, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Eufrosino L. Ramos, a member of the bar, filed a verified complaint against Respondent Eugenio P. Miculob, also a lawyer [1]. Ramos alleged that in a sworn statement addressed to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs on July 6, 1961, Miculob admitted to giving HK$2,500.00 to Philippine Consul General Jose Fornier in December 1960 to secure a visa for a client named John Lau [1]. Ramos contended that this act constituted malpractice, gross misconduct, bribery, and a violation of the lawyer's oath [1]. However, the subject matter of the complaint was still pending investigation in the Department of Foreign Affairs regarding charges filed by the respondent against Consul General Fornier and Consuls Sabalones and Cataumber [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the administrative complaint for disbarment is premature.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the complaint for disbarment is premature and should be dismissed [3]. The subject matter of the complaint filed with the Supreme Court was still pending investigation in the Department of Foreign Affairs due to the charges filed by the respondent against the concerned Consuls [2, 3]. Therefore, the Court resolved to dismiss the case without prejudice to refiling it if the decision rendered in the pending administrative charges would justify such action [2].
