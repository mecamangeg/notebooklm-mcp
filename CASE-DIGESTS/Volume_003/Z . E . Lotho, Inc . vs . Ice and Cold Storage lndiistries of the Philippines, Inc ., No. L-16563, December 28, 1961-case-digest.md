I. CAPTION
Z. E. LOTHO, INC. v. ICE AND COLD STORAGE INDUSTRIES OF THE PHILIPPINES, INC. ET AL., G.R. No. L-16563, December 28, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Z. E. Lotho, Inc. operated an ice plant in Laguna under a certificate of public convenience. From 1947 to 1951, it suffered losses and eventually stopped operations, resuming briefly in 1955 before ceasing business entirely in June of that year [1, 2]. During breakdowns, petitioner purchased ice from respondent Ice and Cold Storage Industries of the Philippines, Inc. for resale [2].

Petitioner knew as early as 1948 that respondent was selling ice to dealers within petitioner's franchised territory [3]. However, instead of stopping the practice, petitioner unsuccessfully tried to win back the dealers' patronage and even bought ice from the respondent itself [4, 5]. It was not until March 11, 1957—nine years later—that petitioner filed an action for unfair competition and damages in the Court of First Instance of Laguna [3, 6]. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the grounds of laches and consent [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner’s action for unfair competition and damages is barred by laches.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the equitable defense of laches applies, barring the petitioner's claim. Citing *Go Chi Gon vs. Co Cho*, the Court outlined the four essential elements of laches: (1) conduct by the defendant giving rise to the complaint; (2) delay in asserting rights despite knowledge and opportunity; (3) lack of knowledge by the defendant that the complainant would assert the right; and (4) injury or prejudice to the defendant if relief is accorded [7].

Here, the petitioner knew of the respondent's sales since 1948 but waited nine years to file suit, an unreasonable delay [3]. This inaction evinced implied consent, especially since petitioner itself purchased ice from the respondent [5, 8]. Furthermore, the statutory prescriptive period for actions based on "injury to the rights of the plaintiff" is only four years under Art. 1146 of the Civil Code [9]. Finally, the delay prejudiced the respondent because material records necessary to controvert the claim for damages were lost over time [10]. It would be inequitable to allow the petitioner to reap benefits after sleeping on its rights [11].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
