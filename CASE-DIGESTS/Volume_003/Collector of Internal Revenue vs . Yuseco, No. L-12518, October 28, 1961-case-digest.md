I. CAPTION
COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. J.C. YUSECO and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-12518, October 28, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent J.C. Yuseco failed to file income tax returns for 1945 and 1946 [1]. Revenue examiners assessed taxes and surcharges, demanding payment in 1948 [1]. Yuseco requested reinvestigations, which the Petitioner Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) denied, reiterating demands for payment [1]. On January 20, 1955, the CIR issued a warrant of distraint and levy to collect the 1946 tax [2]. On December 12, 1955, Yuseco filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) to enjoin the CIR from collecting the taxes by summary distraint and levy [2]. The CTA rendered judgment in favor of Yuseco, declaring the warrant null and void and enjoining the CIR from further collection proceedings [3]. The CIR appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the CTA lacks jurisdiction to entertain an independent special civil action for prohibition without an appeal from a decision of the Collector [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Tax Appeals has original jurisdiction to issue writs of prohibition and injunction independently of an appeal from a decision of the Collector of Internal Revenue.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Court of Tax Appeals does not have original jurisdiction to issue writs of prohibition and injunction independently of, and apart from, an appealed case [4].

Under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125, the CTA is vested with exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review decisions of the Collector of Internal Revenue [5]. The power to issue writs of prohibition or injunction under Section 11 of the same Act to suspend tax collection is merely ancillary to and in furtherance of its appellate jurisdiction [4]. Legislative history confirms that Congress intended to create a regular court with exclusive appellate jurisdiction, not one clothed with original jurisdiction to issue such writs [6, 7]. Since Yuseco filed an independent petition for prohibition rather than an appeal from a decision of the Collector, the CTA lacked jurisdiction.

The judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals is annulled and set aside [8].
