**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ALFREDO PERALTA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15959, October 11, 1961, Per Curiam.

**II. FACTS**
Alfredo Peralta and Roman Fernando were inmates at the New Bilibid Prison serving sentences for other crimes. On December 26, 1958, they were charged with murder for killing fellow inmate Guillermo Lutero with treachery and evident premeditation. During the proceedings, their counsel *de oficio* advised them that pleading guilty would result in the maximum penalty of death due to the circumstances. Despite this warning, both accused insisted on pleading guilty. The Court of First Instance of Rizal convicted them of murder, appreciating the special aggravating circumstance of quasi-recidivism under Article 160 of the Revised Penal Code, and sentenced them to death.

On appeal, the counsel *de oficio* argued the lower court should have taken evidence to ensure the accused understood the consequences of their plea. Meanwhile, the counsel *de parte* argued that the allegation of quasi-recidivism was ambiguous because the information did not specify whether the sentences they were already serving were for crimes under the Revised Penal Code or special laws.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the trial court erred in accepting the plea of guilty without taking further evidence to ensure the accused understood its consequences.
2. W/N quasi-recidivism applies if the crime for which the accused is serving sentence is penalized by a special law rather than the Revised Penal Code.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the contention is untenable. The records showed that the defendants insisted on pleading guilty even after their counsel *de oficio* had explicitly advised them beforehand that the maximum penalty (death) would be imposed as a consequence of their plea [1, 2]. This demonstrated they understood the nature and consequences of their action.

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that for the purposes of quasi-recidivism under Article 160 of the Revised Penal Code, it makes no difference whether the crime for which an accused is serving sentence at the time of the commission of the new offense falls under the Revised Penal Code or a special law [2-4]. The law applies in either case.

**Decision affirmed.**
