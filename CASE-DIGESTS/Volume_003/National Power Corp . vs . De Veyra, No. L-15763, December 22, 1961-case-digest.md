I. CAPTION
NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION v. HON. JESUS DE VEYRA, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Baguio City and the CITY OF BAGUIO, G.R. No. L-15763, December 22, 1961, Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
On March 31, 1959, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila rendered a final decision ordering respondent City of Baguio to pay petitioner National Power Corporation (NPC) P240,000.00. [1] A writ of execution was issued, and the Sheriff of Baguio City garnished P239,589.80 from the City's cash deposits at the Philippine National Bank (PNB) Baguio Branch. [1]

Respondent City of Baguio then filed a separate complaint (Civil Case No. 866) in the CFI of Baguio City against NPC, PNB, and the Sheriff, questioning the legality of the garnishment and seeking damages. [2] Respondent Judge De Veyra of the CFI of Baguio issued a preliminary mandatory injunction ordering the restoration of the *status quo* of the bank deposits. [3] NPC's motion to dismiss based on lack of jurisdiction was denied, prompting this petition for certiorari. [3, 4]

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a court (CFI Baguio) has jurisdiction to issue an injunction against the garnishment of property ordered by a court of coordinate jurisdiction (CFI Manila). [4]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that property levied upon in garnishment proceedings operates as an attachment, bringing the property into *custodia legis* under the sole control of the court issuing the writ. [4] A court which has control of such property exercises exclusive jurisdiction over it, and no court, except one having supervisory control, has the right to interfere with that possession. [4]

The Court reiterated the principle that no court has the authority to interfere by injunction with the judgments or decrees of a court of concurrent or coordinate jurisdiction. [5] The CFI of Baguio should not have interfered with the CFI of Manila's jurisdiction. [6] The proper remedy for the City of Baguio was to seek relief from the CFI of Manila, the court under whose authority the levy was made. [6]

**Petition granted.** The preliminary mandatory injunction is set aside. [7]
