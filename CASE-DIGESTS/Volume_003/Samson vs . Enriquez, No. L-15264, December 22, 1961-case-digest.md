I. CAPTION
GARCIA SAMSON v. RAMON ENRIQUEZ and FERMIN FILOTEO, G.R. No. L-15264, December 22, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On June 24, 1955, Garcia Samson filed a complaint for forcible entry and damages against Ramon Enriquez and Fermin Filoteo in the Municipal Court of Zamboanga City. Samson alleged that in 1913, he entered into a *contrato de aparceria* (tenancy contract) with Jose Borja, the owner and attorney-in-fact of the co-owners of Lot No. 422. Under this agreement, Samson cultivated the land and paid 25 *cavanes* of palay annually as rental. He claimed he was in peaceful possession until April 13, 1955, when the defendants forcibly dispossessed him.

The Municipal Court initially dismissed the case, citing lack of jurisdiction due to the tenancy nature of the dispute, and transmitted it to the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). After a series of remands and dismissals involving the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zamboanga, the Municipal Court eventually rendered judgment in favor of Samson. The defendants appealed to the CFI, moving to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the case involved a tenancy relationship under Republic Act No. 1199, falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the CAR. The CFI dismissed the appeal, holding that since Samson claimed possession based on a tenancy contract, the proper forum was the CAR. Samson appealed to the Supreme Court on the question of jurisdiction.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of the lower court. The Court held that where a plaintiff unequivocally alleges in his complaint that he is entitled to the possession of an agricultural parcel of land under a *contrato de aparceria* (contract of tenancy), the controversy involves a tenancy relation and a system of cultivation.

Consequently, jurisdiction over such cases properly belongs to the Court of Agrarian Relations, not the regular courts. Since Samson's complaint specifically averred rights stemming from a tenancy agreement with the landowner, the CFI correctly dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. The order appealed from is affirmed.
