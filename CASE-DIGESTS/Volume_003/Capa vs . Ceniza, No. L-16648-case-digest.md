I. CAPTION
CENONA CAPA and SEGUNDO BACANAYA v. JUDGE PATRICIO C. CENIZA and ESTATE OF DECEASED GREGORIA SAQUIN, G.R. No. L-16648, November 30, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In probate proceedings for the estate of Sancho Capa (who died August 18, 1950), the widow, Gregoria Saquin, filed an application for support *pendente lite* [1, 2]. On December 20, 1951, Judge De Leon issued an order denying the motion "for the present" because the court lacked the deed of partition necessary to determine if the property under administration was conjugal or exclusive [2, 3].

Years later, on March 16, 1955, Respondent Judge Ceniza issued an order directing the special administrator to give Saquin three-fourths (3/4) of the cash proceeds from the estate's harvest [2]. No appeal was taken from this order [2]. On July 27, 1959, Petitioner Cenona Capa moved to annul the 1955 order, claiming the 1951 order denying support was final and executory [2]. After the lower court denied her motion, Capa filed this petition for certiorari [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the 1951 order denying support "for the present" was a final judgment that precluded the issuance of the 1955 order granting support.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court dismissed the petition [4].

The Court ruled that the 1951 order was not a final adjudication on the status of the property [5]. The order explicitly stated the denial was only "for the present" because the judge was in no position to determine the nature of the property without the deed of partition [5]. Being provisional and interlocutory, the 1951 order was not appealable and could not become final and executory [5]. Therefore, the Respondent Judge did not exceed his jurisdiction or abuse his discretion in issuing the 1955 order granting support [4].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
