I. CAPTION
CEFERINO E. PAREDES v. FELIX V. BORJA and CRESENCIO CATALAN, G.R. No. L-15559, November 29, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On June 2, 1958, a complaint for malicious mischief was filed against respondent Cresencio Catalan in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Bonifacio, presided by respondent Judge Felix Borja [1]. On June 6, 1958, Catalan pleaded guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment and a fine [1]. Before the judgment became final, Catalan filed an amended motion for reconsideration, claiming ownership of the land where the alleged mischief occurred based on a favorable decision in a separate Civil Case (No. 1434) and arguing that his liability was merely civil [2]. He prayed to withdraw his plea of guilty and substitute it with a plea of not guilty [2].

On June 12, 1958, Judge Borja set aside the judgment and allowed the change of plea [2]. Petitioner Fiscal Paredes moved for reconsideration, arguing the motion was unverified and lacked affidavits of merit, but this was denied [2, 3]. Paredes filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI), which ruled that the JP’s orders were null and void for being irregular and unwarranted [4]. Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Justice of the Peace committed grave abuse of discretion in setting aside the judgment of conviction to allow a change of plea before the judgment became final.
2. W/N the motion to withdraw the plea of guilty required verification and affidavits of merit.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 6, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court, the court may, in its discretion, set aside a judgment of conviction and allow a plea of not guilty at any time before the judgment becomes final [5]. Acts done by an inferior court in the exercise of its discretion will not be interfered with by an appellate court in the absence of grave abuse [5, 6]. In this case, the JP Court doubted the accused's guilt and considered the plea improvident because the accused asserted a valid claim of ownership over the land, supported by a decision in a civil case presented in evidence [7, 8].

2. **NO.** The strict rule in *Fiscal of Manila v. Del Rosario* (1928), which required such motions to be verified and accompanied by affidavits of merit under General Orders No. 58, is no longer controlling [6, 9]. The 1940 Rules of Court do not require a motion for a new trial to be verified [9, 10]. Furthermore, while an affidavit of merit is generally required for motions based on newly discovered evidence, the lack thereof was cured by the testimony under oath of the accused at the hearing of the motion for reconsideration [9, 10].

Judgment reversed.
