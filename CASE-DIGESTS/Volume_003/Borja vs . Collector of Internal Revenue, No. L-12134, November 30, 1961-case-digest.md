I. CAPTION
CONSUELO P. BORJA v. THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-12134, November 30, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Consuelo P. Borja is a grantee of a legislative franchise under Act No. 3810 to operate an electric light, heat, and power system in Iligan [1]. Her franchise is subject to the terms of Act No. 3636 (Model Electric Light and Power Franchise Act), which requires payment of a 2% franchise tax on gross earnings "in lieu of any and all taxes... on its poles, wires, insulators... installations... and on its franchise, rights, privileges, receipts, revenues and profits" [2].

In 1953, 1954, and 1955, petitioner imported electrical materials and equipment, such as wires and transformers, from Japan [1]. She paid the compensating tax amounting to P4,104.25 to the respondent Collector of Internal Revenue but subsequently sought a refund of P3,977.62, claiming exemption under her franchise [1, 3]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) denied her claim for refund [1]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner is exempt from the payment of the compensating tax prescribed in Section 190 of the Tax Code on her imported electrical materials based on the "in lieu of all taxes" provision in her franchise.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's decision. Relying on the doctrine in *Panay Electric Co. v. Collector of Internal Revenue* (G.R. No. L-6753), the Court held that the franchise exemption ("in lieu of all taxes... on its poles... installations") refers to taxes on the privilege of using public streets and places for installations, which is a right specific to the franchise grantee, rather than a tax on the importation of goods [3, 4]. The exemption does not extend to the common right or privilege of making purchases, which is enjoyed by the public in general [5].

The Court explained that the compensating tax under Section 190 of the Tax Code acts as an "equalizer" to place casual importers on equal footing with established merchants who pay sales tax [6, 7]. If petitioner had purchased the equipment locally, she would have borne the burden of sales tax passed on by the dealer; thus, she cannot avoid this burden by importing directly [8]. Furthermore, tax exemptions are highly disfavored and must be justified by a clear grant of law [9]. Unlike income tax exemptions on expressly listed "receipts, revenues and profits" (distinguishing *Carcar Electric*), the exemption from compensating tax is not clearly expressed in the franchise [10].

The petition for review is dismissed, and the decision appealed from is affirmed *in toto*, with costs against the petitioner [11].
