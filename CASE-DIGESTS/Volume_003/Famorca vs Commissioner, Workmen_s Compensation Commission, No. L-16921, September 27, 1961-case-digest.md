I. CAPTION
VALERIO FAMORCA v. THE COMMISSIONER, WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, BUREAU OF LABOR, and THE DEPUTY SHERIFF OF KIANGAN, MOUNTAIN PROVINCE, G.R. No. L-16921, September 27, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Ernesto Sison filed a claim for P335.57 under the Workmen’s Compensation Act for a leg injury sustained while employed by petitioner Valerio Famorca. The claim was not controverted, and the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded the compensation. The award became final as no appeal was taken [1]. The WCC then ordered the execution of the award and directed the Deputy Sheriff of Kiangan, Mountain Province, to carry it out. Famorca filed a petition for a writ of prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Kalinga, Bontoc, and Ifugao to prevent the WCC and the sheriff from enforcing the award. The CFI granted the writ. The respondents appealed the CFI decision to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Workmen’s Compensation Commission has the power to issue a writ of execution to enforce its awards.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that the WCC lacks the power to issue writs of execution [2, 3]. Citing *Pastoral v. Commissioners of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission*, the Court explained that under Section 51 of Act No. 3428 (Workmen’s Compensation Act), the proper procedure for enforcement is for the interested party to file a certified copy of the referee’s or Commissioner’s final decision in a court of record where the accident occurred [3, 4]. The court will then render a judgment based on that decision, and it is this judgment that may be enforced by a writ of execution pursuant to Section 8, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court [4, 5]. The Court further held that the Reorganization Acts could not validly confer this power upon the WCC, as doing so would diminish the jurisdiction and judicial power vested by law in courts of record [6].

The judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED [7].
