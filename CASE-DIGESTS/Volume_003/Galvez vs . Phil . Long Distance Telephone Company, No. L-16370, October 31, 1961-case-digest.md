I. CAPTION
**JOSE S. GALVEZ, Deceased (Represented by his widow and heir, GRACIA VDA. DE GALVEZ) v. PHILIPPINE LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE COMPANY and THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS**, G.R. No. L-16370, October 31, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Jose S. Galvez was an employee of respondent Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) for over 38 years until his death in 1951. His widow, petitioner Gracia Vda. de Galvez, received P24,000.00 from PLDT as pension and death benefits. Subsequently, in a separate case (*Jeturian v. PLDT*), the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) and the Supreme Court declared PLDT's pre-war Employees' Pension Plan valid and subsisting. Implementing this, the CIR examiner determined Jose’s share in the plan to be P13,028.64.

On January 8, 1959, the CIR issued an order directing PLDT to deposit said amount for Jose’s heirs. PLDT appealed this order to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-15120), but the petition was dismissed, rendering the CIR order final and executory. However, on April 14, 1959, PLDT filed a petition with the CIR claiming that since the widow had already received P24,000.00, and Jose’s total entitlement (pre-war and post-war) was calculated at P25,028.64, only P1,028.64 remained due. The CIR granted this in an order dated September 8, 1959, effectively reducing the award. Petitioner appealed, arguing the lower court unlawfully amended a final order.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations may alter or modify its January 8, 1959 order after it had become final and executory.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the September 8, 1959 order.

The Court held that the lower court had no authority to alter or modify the January 8, 1959 order. This order, which awarded P13,028.64 to the petitioner, had already been affirmed by the CIR *en banc* and the appeal against it was dismissed by the Supreme Court for lack of merit [1]. Consequently, the order became final and executory and was no longer subject to alteration [2].

The Court emphasized that equitable considerations cannot offset the demands of public policy and public interest regarding the finality of judgments. Issues passed upon in decisions that have become executory must be deemed conclusively disposed of to ensure an end to litigation [2]. The Court cited *Rattan Art & Decorations, Inc. v. Rattan Art & Decorations Union* and *Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. v. Philippine Labor Organization* to support the principle that final judgments are immutable [2].

**Disposition:** The order appealed from is set aside. Respondent PLDT is directed to deposit the sum of P13,028.64 with the CIR for the benefit of the heirs of Jose S. Galvez [3].
