I. CAPTION
LA MALLORCA and PAMPANGA BUS COMPANY, INC. v. RAMOS, G.R. No. L-15476, September 19, 1961, 3 SCRA 77, Natividad, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Nicanor Ramos, a driver for petitioners La Mallorca and Pampanga Bus Company, Inc., filed a claim with Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor for disability compensation due to tuberculosis allegedly contracted during his employment [1]. The Regional Office rendered a decision ordering petitioners to pay Ramos P1,862.00 [1].

Petitioners filed an action for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to enjoin the enforcement of the decision, arguing that under Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, the Regional Office had no jurisdiction to hear the claim [2]. The CFI ruled in favor of petitioners, declaring the Regional Office's decision null and void ab initio for lack of jurisdiction [2]. Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor has jurisdiction to hear and decide claims for disability compensation under the Workmen’s Compensation Law pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 20-A.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Regional Office has jurisdiction. While the Supreme Court previously held in *Corominas v. Labor Standard Commission* and *Miller v. Mardo* that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is void insofar as it grants Regional Offices jurisdiction over general money claims, this invalidity does not extend to claims falling under the Workmen’s Compensation Law [4, 5].

Under Section 48 of the Workmen’s Compensation Law (Act No. 3428, as amended), the Workmen's Compensation Commission has the right to appoint referees with jurisdiction to hear and decide claims. The Regional Offices created under Plan 20-A partake of the nature of such referees [6]. Since the claim involved is for disability due to tuberculosis, which falls squarely under Section 2 of the Workmen’s Compensation Law, the grant of jurisdiction to the Regional Office is legal and its decision is valid [6, 7]. Regarding enforcement, it is presumed that the proper procedure under Section 51 of Act No. 3428 (judicial enforcement) will be followed, as no attempt at direct enforcement by the Regional Office was shown [8, 9].

The decision of the lower court is **REVERSED**, and the petition for prohibition is dismissed [9].
