I. CAPTION
CHOY KING TEE alias CHUA KING TEE v. EMILIO L. GALANG, as Commissioner of Immigration, G.R. No. L-18351, March 26, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Tan Ban Seng, a native of China, was granted Philippine citizenship by naturalization in January 1959. His wife, petitioner Choy King Tee, also a Chinese national, had been entering the Philippines from Hong Kong as a temporary visitor, with her authorized stay expiring in February 1961. Tan Ban Seng requested the Commissioner of Immigration to recognize Choy King Tee as a Philippine citizen, cancel her alien registration, and issue an identification certificate. The Commissioner denied the request regarding the wife. Choy King Tee filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI granted the petition, ruling that she automatically acquired Philippine citizenship upon her husband's naturalization. The Commissioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the alien wife of a naturalized Filipino citizen automatically becomes a Philippine citizen upon her husband's naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that an alien wife does not automatically become a citizen. Under Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473), a woman married to a Filipino citizen "who might herself be lawfully naturalized" shall be deemed a citizen. The Court interpreted this to mean that the wife must prove she possesses all the qualifications required by Section 2 and none of the disqualifications enumerated in Section 4 of the Naturalization Law. This interpretation aligns with the national policy of "selective admission" to citizenship, which is a privilege limited to those found worthy, regardless of marriage. Since the petitioner failed to prove she possessed the necessary qualifications and lacked disqualifications, she is not entitled to recognition as a citizen.

The decision of the Court of First Instance is **REVERSED**, and the petition is **DENIED**.
