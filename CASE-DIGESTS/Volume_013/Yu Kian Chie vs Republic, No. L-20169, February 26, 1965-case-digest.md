I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF YU KIAN CHIE TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. YU KIAN CHIE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20169, February 26, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On February 4, 1960, Petitioner Yu Kian Chie, a citizen of the Republic of China, filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, claiming to be an employee since 1957 with an average annual income of P3,000.00 [1]. The Solicitor General opposed the petition [1]. On December 18, 1961, the CFI granted the petition [2].

After the Solicitor General appealed, but pending approval of the record on appeal, Yu filed a motion to reopen the case to present proof of increased income, claiming it rose to P5,100.00 in 1960 and P5,200.00 in 1961 due to salary increases and bonuses [3]. The CFI rendered a Supplemental Decision on July 18, 1962, maintaining the grant of citizenship [3]. The Solicitor General appealed, contending that Yu failed to prove he had a lucrative income, especially noting that Yu's status changed from single to married in 1961 [3, 4]. Evidence showed Yu’s income consisted of a basic salary of P150.00 and allowances/bonuses contingent on company profits [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner has a lucrative income to qualify for naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that allowances and bonuses which spring from the purely voluntary actuations of an employer, conditioned on the circumstance that the employer is making profits, should not be added to the basic salary to determine lucrative income [6, 7]. Without these contingent amounts, Yu's true income was only P150.00 a month, which is not lucrative [6].

Furthermore, even granting *arguendo* that the petitioner received a fixed monthly salary of P400.00 (as alleged in the supplemental evidence) starting in 1962, this amount still cannot be considered lucrative because the petitioner got married in 1961 [8]. The financial requirement increases when the applicant's status changes to married.

The decision appealed from is REVERSED and the petition for Philippine citizenship is DENIED [9].
