**I. CAPTION**
THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. BINALBAGAN ESTATE, INC., G.R. No. L-12752, March 31, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Binalbagan Estate, Inc. acquired 216,000 non-par value shares of BISCOM in exchange for its tangible assets and sugar quota. Respondent subsequently sold these shares. In a previous decision, the Supreme Court held that the acquisition cost base for the BISCOM shares was the fair market value of the assets given in exchange. The Collector of Internal Revenue filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the acquisition cost should be the capital invested in the assets rather than their fair market value. The Collector contended that using the fair market value allows the respondent to avoid paying taxes on the "paper profit" or the increase in value of the assets at the time of the exchange [1, 2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the cost basis of shares acquired in exchange for corporate assets is the fair market value of said assets at the time of the exchange.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that in a sale of shares acquired in exchange for corporate assets, the cost basis is the fair market value of the assets at the time of the exchange, not the capital invested [3]. The increase in the value of the assets should have been taxed as profit realized from the exchange itself, which is distinct from the tax on the profit from the subsequent sale of the shares [4, 5].

The Court rejected the Collector's argument that the exchange yielded only "paper profit," as this would render paragraph (c) of Section 35 of the National Internal Revenue Code nugatory [5]. Assessing the tax on the asset appreciation as part of the tax on the share sale would be inequitable and unfair, particularly because prescription for the tax on the exchange may have already set in [5].

The Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED** [6].
