I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE TRANSPORT AND GENERAL WORKERS ORGANIZATION (PTGWO-ITF) v. HON. JUDGE JULIO VILLAMOR and NORTHWEST AIRLINES, INC., G.R. No. L-17996, January 30, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner PTGWO filed an original petition in the Supreme Court regarding a labor dispute precipitated by a strike of Northwest Airlines Flight Engineers in the United States [1, 2]. During the pendency of the case, the Supreme Court requested the parties to show cause why the petition should not be dismissed, noting that the US strike had already been settled [2]. PTGWO admitted that the dispute of the International Association of Machinists on behalf of the Flight Engineers had been submitted to an arbitration board in America and that the picketing had ceased [2]. However, PTGWO urged the Court to resolve the case to interpret the term "affiliation" under Section 9(d) of Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act) in the context of international affiliation, arguing that a decision was necessary to serve as a guide for future labor disputes [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court should decide the case on its merits to interpret Republic Act No. 875 despite the settlement of the underlying labor dispute.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the case has become moot and academic due to the settlement of the strike and the cessation of picketing [3]. The underlying cause of the petition—the strike of the Flight Engineers in the United States—had been resolved by submission to an arbitration board [2]. Consequently, the Court found no need to issue a ruling solely for jurisprudence as requested by the petitioner [3].

The petition was dismissed without costs [3].
