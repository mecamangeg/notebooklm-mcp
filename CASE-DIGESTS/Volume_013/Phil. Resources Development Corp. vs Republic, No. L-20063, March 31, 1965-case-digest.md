I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, MACARIO APOSTOL and EMPIRE INSURANCE COMPANY, G.R. No. L-20063, March 31, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Macario Apostol contracted with the Bureau of Prisons (Republic) to purchase logs and resin but incurred a debt of P34,015.06. Empire Insurance Company served as his surety for P10,000. To settle his account, Apostol delivered construction materials (GI sheets, pipes, and black iron sheets) valued at P30,436.94 to the Bureau. The Bureau, however, refused to credit these items to Apostol's debt due to lack of supporting papers.

The Republic filed a collection suit against Apostol and Empire in the Court of First Instance (CFI). Philippine Resources Development Corporation (PRDC), of which Apostol was president, intervened, claiming it owned the materials Apostol delivered. The CFI ruled in favor of the Republic regarding the debt but ordered the Republic to pay PRDC the value of the materials. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed Apostol's liability but dismissed PRDC's intervention, ostensibly upholding the Republic's defense of state immunity. PRDC appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the complaint in intervention should be dismissed on the ground of state immunity.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The dismissal was incorrect because the intervention was effectively directed against Apostol, not the Republic.

While the Court reaffirmed the doctrine that a claim may not be maintained against the State without its consent (*Compania General de Tabacos v. Government of the Philippine Islands*), this immunity did not apply here. The Republic asserted no interest in the materials adverse to PRDC; in fact, it had refused to credit them to Apostol's account. It was Apostol who adversely asserted ownership. Therefore, he is the party against whom the intervention proceeded. As a private individual, Apostol cannot avail himself of the defense of state immunity. Under Article 1891 of the New Civil Code, Apostol is bound to account for the properties he held as president of PRDC.

The petition is **GRANTED** insofar as the intervention is concerned. The CA judgment is **MODIFIED**: Apostol and Empire are ordered to pay the Republic; the dismissal of the intervention is set aside, and Apostol is ordered to return the materials to PRDC or pay their value of P30,436.94.
