I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BLAS GONZALES, G.R. No. L-17962, April 30, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Blas Gonzales, a Filipino furniture manufacturer and concessionaire at the U.S. Military Base in Clark Field, filed income tax returns for the years 1946 and 1947 declaring combined sales of P1,787,848.32 [1]. A Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) investigation revealed that Gonzales actually received P2,199,920.50 from base authorities and had undeclared "local sales" of P124,510.43, resulting in a substantial under-declaration of income [2]. The BIR assessed deficiency income taxes totaling P144,076.33 [3]. When Gonzales failed to pay, the Republic filed a collection suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [3]. Gonzales moved to dismiss, claiming exemption under the U.S.-Philippine Military Bases Agreement, but the motion was denied [4]. During the scheduled trial, Gonzales and his counsel failed to appear; his counsel later claimed absence was due to lack of transportation during heavy rains [5]. The CFI declared Gonzales in default and rendered judgment ordering him to pay the deficiency taxes with surcharge and interest [4, 6]. Gonzales appealed, arguing he was exempt from tax as a concessionaire and that the default order denied him his day in court [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a Filipino concessionaire in a U.S. Military Base is exempt from Philippine income tax under the Military Bases Agreement.
2. W/N the trial court abused its discretion in declaring the appellant in default.
3. W/N the imposition of the fraud penalty was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO**. The exemption provided in Article XVIII of the Military Bases Agreement applies only to the right to establish agencies and concessions, and to the merchandise or services sold, but not to the income of the owner or operator [9]. Citing *Canlas v. Republic* and *Naguiat v. J. A. Araneta*, the Court held that income tax is levied on the operator, not on the concession itself [9, 10]. Furniture manufacturers and public utility operators fall within the term "concessionaires" and are subject to Philippine income tax laws [11, 12].

2. **NO**. The granting of adjournments and reconsideration of default orders lies within the sound discretion of the courts and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of grave abuse [13]. The Court found the counsel's excuse of heavy rain insufficient, noting that the opposing counsel, a lady attorney residing in a flooded area, managed to appear for the trial [5].

3. **YES**. Fraud is a state of mind that may be inferred from circumstances [14]. The Court ruled that the appellant's failure to declare his true and actual income for two consecutive years (1946 and 1947) was a clear indication of fraudulent intent to cheat the Government of its taxes, justifying the imposition of the fraud penalty [14, 15].

The appealed decision is AFFIRMED [16].
