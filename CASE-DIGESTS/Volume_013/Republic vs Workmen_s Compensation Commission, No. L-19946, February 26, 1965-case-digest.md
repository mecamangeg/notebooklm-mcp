**I. CAPTION**
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and IRENE FERNANDEZ VDA. DE ESPIRITU, G.R. No. L-19946, February 26, 1965, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Gregorio H. Espiritu, a letter-carrier, died of pulmonary tuberculosis contracted during his employment. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded death benefits to his widow, Irene Fernandez, and to two minors, Manuel and Jose Espiritu, who were his alleged illegitimate children by another woman. The Republic of the Philippines (petitioner) did not dispute the compensability of the death or the award to the widow but appealed the award to the minors. The Republic argued that the minors were not dependents under the Workmen’s Compensation Act because their filiation was not established. The only evidence presented to prove the minors' relationship to the deceased were their baptismal certificates [1-4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the alleged illegitimate minor children are entitled to death benefits as dependents under the Workmen’s Compensation Act.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court ruled that the minors are not entitled to benefits because their filiation was not properly established. To be entitled to support and successional rights, illegitimate (spurious) children must prove filiation through voluntary or compulsory recognition [5].

The Court held that the baptismal certificates presented are not "records of birth" or "authentic writings" required for voluntary recognition under Article 278 of the Civil Code. They only prove the administration of the sacrament by the priest, not the truth of the declarations regarding parentage (*Adriano v. De Jesus*) [4]. While the fact that the minors lived with and were supported by the deceased is a ground for compulsory recognition (Article 283), they never instituted a court action to enforce this recognition, a matter which falls outside the jurisdiction of the WCC [6].

The petition is granted in part. The decision is **MODIFIED** by eliminating the award of compensation to the two minors; the petitioner is ordered to pay the calculated compensation amount solely to the widow [6].
