I. CAPTION
ORIENTAL TIN CANS WORKERS’ UNION-PAFLU vs. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and ORIENTAL TIN CAN AND METAL SHEETS MANUFACTURING COMPANY, G.R. No. L-17695, February 26, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On March 2, 1959, petitioner Oriental Tin Cans Workers’ Union-PAFLU filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to enforce the observance of a check-off system against respondent Oriental Tin Can and Metal Sheets Manufacturing Company [1]. On September 8, 1959, the CIR dismissed the petition [2]. The petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, but the CIR *en banc* denied it by a three-to-two vote [2]. Consequently, the petitioner filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court to review the CIR's order and resolution [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction to enforce a check-off authorized by employees in writing.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) lacks jurisdiction over the case. While Section 10 of the Minimum Wage Law (Republic Act No. 602) imposes a statutory duty on employers to check-off union dues when authorized in writing, not every case arising under this law falls within the CIR's jurisdiction following the enactment of the Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act No. 875) [3, 4].

Under Republic Act No. 875 and Section 16 of Republic Act No. 602, the CIR's jurisdiction over minimum wage cases is limited to two specific instances: (1) where the dispute involves a demand for minimum wages *above* the applicable statutory minimum; or (2) where the demand for minimum wages involves an actual *strike* [5-8]. In this case, there was no dispute regarding minimum wages above the statutory minimum, nor was there an actual strike involved [9]. Therefore, the CIR had no jurisdiction to enforce the check-off.

The order and resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations are AFFIRMED [10].
