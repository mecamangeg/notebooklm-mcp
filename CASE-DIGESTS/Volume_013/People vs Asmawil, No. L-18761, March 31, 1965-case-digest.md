I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AMIRIL ASMAWIL, G.R. No. L-18761, March 31, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of December 29, 1956, in Talipao, Sulu, Amiril Asmawil sought out Councilor Sanadi Bakon. After finding Bakon at the house of his second wife, the two proceeded towards the house of Bakon’s first wife. While waiting at the gate, Asmawil suddenly hacked Bakon across the breast with a *barong*, causing his immediate death. Asmawil then took the victim's .45 caliber pistol and fled. The incident was witnessed by the victim's daughter, Anti, and one Halid Majid, who recognized the accused by the light of a lamp [1, 2].

The Court of First Instance of Sulu convicted Asmawil of Robbery with Homicide, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua*. Asmawil appealed, relying on an alibi and challenging the credibility of the prosecution witnesses due to their blood relationship with the deceased. Additionally, the victim's widow, Anang, who had initially identified Asmawil in an affidavit, recanted her statement after subsequently marrying the accused [3-5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the witnesses' relationship to the victim renders their testimony less credible.
2. W/N the recantation of the victim's widow warrants the acquittal of the accused.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that where no improper motive, such as a personal grudge against the accused, has been shown, the relationship of the witnesses to the victim does not render their clear and positive testimony less worthy of full faith and credit [4, 6]. The Court cited *People v. Valera*, ruling that blood relationship alone does not disqualify a witness or automatically impair their credibility. The positive identification by Anti and Halid Majid prevails over the accused's uncorroborated alibi [6, 7].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the widow's repudiation of her affidavit cannot overcome the positive testimonies of the other eyewitnesses. The Court noted that the disavowal occurred only after she had married the appellant and attempted to bribe another witness to recant. Under these circumstances, her choice to defend her new husband was not deemed sufficient to overturn the conviction [5, 8].

**Judgment affirmed.**
