I. CAPTION
LORENZO E. MACANSANTOS and TOMAS E. MACANSANTOS v. TEOFILA GUINOO and VICENTE GUINOO, G.R. No. L-19973, April 30, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
This is the third case between the parties regarding Lot No. 127-A of the Davao Townsite. In the first case (G.R. No. L-5541), the Supreme Court affirmed the reconveyance of one-half of the lot to petitioners Macansantos but made no pronouncement regarding improvements or the return of consideration paid by respondents Guinoo. The judgment became final and executory. During execution, disputes arose regarding the inclusion of improvements and consideration in the deed of reconveyance. Petitioners filed a second case for mandamus (G.R. No. L-13726) to compel the inclusion of improvements, which the Court dismissed, ruling that the trial court could not modify the final judgment in L-5541.

Petitioners then filed the present action (Civil Case No. 2061) for partition and recovery of rentals, damages, and ownership of improvements on the lot. The Court of First Instance of Davao dismissed the claims for damages, rentals, and improvements, ordering only the partition of the property, on the ground that these issues were already barred by prior judgments.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners' claims for improvements, rentals, and damages are barred by *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the issues raised regarding improvements, consideration, rentals, and damages were the same issues involved in the previous mandamus case and the original action for reconveyance. The Court emphasized that the decision in the first case (G.R. No. L-5541) was "plain and simple" in ordering the reconveyance of the lot without mentioning improvements or consideration [1].

Since that decision had long become final and executory, the trial court could no longer "change, amplify, enlarge, alter or modify" it [2, 3]. Allowing the inclusion of improvements or consideration now would amount to an impermissible alteration of a final decision. Consequently, the Court held that the petitioners' alleged rights to the improvements, damages, and rentals were conclusively barred by *res judicata* [4, 5].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
