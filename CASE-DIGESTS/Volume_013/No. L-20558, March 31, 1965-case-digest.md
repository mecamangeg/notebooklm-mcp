I. CAPTION
MELITON O. GO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20558, March 31, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On January 26, 1959, Meliton O. Go filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Manila. On April 4, 1960, the lower court rendered a decision granting the petition. No appeal was taken, and the decision became final. On May 20, 1962, Go moved to set a date for the reception of evidence to prove compliance with R.A. No. 530 to allow him to take his oath. The Solicitor General moved to dismiss the petition on two grounds: (1) Go failed to allege his former places of residence (specifically "250 T. Pinpin, Manila" and "Narra Street, Tondo") as shown by his immigrant certificate and witness testimony, listing only his current and one other former address; and (2) Go failed to allege his alias/other name "Go King Siong," despite being referred to as such in his NBI clearance. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. Go appealed, arguing that the 1960 decision granting his naturalization had already become final and could not be revoked.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to allege former places of residence and alias names in the petition is a fatal defect.
2. W/N the lower court may validly revoke or dismiss a naturalization decision that has already become final.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The failure to allege former places of residence is a violation of the mandatory provision of Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law. This omission is a fatal defect that not only warrants the dismissal of the petition but also affects the jurisdiction of the court to hear and decide the case [1-3]. The purpose of the requirement is to enable the public and investigating agencies to gather information and voice objections; omitting these facts deprives them of that opportunity [4]. Similarly, the failure to allege an alias or other name by which the petitioner is known (in this case, "Go King Siong") adversely affects the proceedings and renders the decision obtained invalid [5-7].

2. **YES.** Despite the fact that the decision granting naturalization had become final, it may still be revoked when there are irregularities or defects that affect the jurisdiction of the court [5, 6]. Section 18 of the Revised Naturalization Law authorizes the cancellation of a certificate of naturalization obtained fraudulently or illegally. Since the original decision was secured illegally due to the jurisdictional defects in the petition, the lower court was justified in dismissing the petition and impliedly revoking the decision [8].

The Order appealed from is affirmed.
