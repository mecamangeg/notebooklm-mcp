I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RICARDO REYNO, G.R. No. L-19071, April 30, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On the early morning of April 7, 1961, in Cabanatuan City, Noel Vigilia was stabbed and subsequently died from severe hemorrhage. Prior to the stabbing, the deceased and his companions had reprimanded a group, which included the accused Ricardo Reyno, for tinkering with a water pipe. Later, prosecution witness Nicolas Ruiz, Jr. witnessed the stabbing and identified Reyno as the assailant. Police authorities later apprehended Reyno on a bus bound for Manila, where he acted suspiciously and gave conflicting accounts of his destination. A search of his bag yielded a fan knife, and a search of his sister's house yielded a T-shirt belonging to him. NBI chemical analysis revealed that the knife and the T-shirt were positive for human blood, and the blood on the T-shirt matched the blood type of the deceased, which was different from Reyno's blood type. The Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija convicted Reyno of murder and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*. Reyno appealed, interposing the defense of alibi and arguing there was no motive for the killing.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused's defense of alibi can prevail over positive identification and physical evidence.
2. W/N the lack of established motive precludes the commission of the offense.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that alibi cannot overcome the positive identification by the prosecution witness, Ruiz, Jr., which was spontaneously made when he confronted the accused. Furthermore, the identification was convincingly corroborated by the NBI Chemist's findings. The knife found in the accused's possession tested positive for human blood, and the blood found on the hem of his T-shirt tallied with the blood grouping of the deceased, disproving Reyno's claim that the blood was planted or his own.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that lack of motive does not preclude the commission of an offense. While the incident regarding the water pipe might seem trivial, the Court noted it is of judicial knowledge that persons have been assaulted for lesser or no reason at all.

**ACCORDINGLY**, the decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** in all respects, with costs against the accused-appellant.
