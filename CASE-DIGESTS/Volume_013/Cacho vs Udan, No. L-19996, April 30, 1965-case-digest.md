I. CAPTION
WENCESLA CACHO v. JOHN G. UDAN and RUSTICO G. UDAN, G.R. No. L-19996, April 30, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Silvina G. Udan, single, died on December 13, 1959, leaving a purported will naming her illegitimate son, Francisco G. Udan, and Wencesla Cacho (petitioner) as sole heirs [1]. Cacho filed a petition to probate the will. Initially, Rustico Udan (Silvina's legitimate brother) opposed the probate but withdrew after Francisco appeared [1]. However, Francisco died in June 1961, two years after his mother [1]. Following Francisco's death, Rustico and John Udan (another legitimate brother) filed oppositions to the probate, alleging defects in the will's execution and the testatrix's capacity [2]. The Court of First Instance of Zambales disallowed their oppositions for "lack of interest in the estate," ruling that the illegitimate son, Francisco, had already acquired successional rights excluding the brothers [3, 4]. The brothers appealed, arguing they became heirs after Francisco's death or that Francisco had not accepted the inheritance.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the legitimate brothers of the decedent have the legal standing to oppose the probate of the will despite the existence of an illegitimate son.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order, holding that the brothers had no interest in the estate [5].

The Court reasoned that under Articles 988 and 1003 of the Civil Code, collateral relatives (such as brothers and sisters) inherit only in the absence of descendants, ascendants, and illegitimate children [6]. Since Silvina left an illegitimate son, Francisco, he inherited her estate *ab intestato* to the exclusion of her brothers [4, 7]. Consequently, if the will is probated, the brothers are excluded by its terms; if denied, they are excluded by the illegitimate son by operation of law [7].

The Court further ruled that Francisco's death two years later did not transmit rights to the brothers. Under Article 992 of the Civil Code (the "Iron Curtain Rule"), legitimate relatives of the mother cannot succeed her illegitimate child [8]. Furthermore, the Court rejected the argument that Francisco failed to accept the inheritance, noting that acceptance is presumed under Article 1057 unless validly repudiated, and Francisco's own opposition to the will was compatible with a claim to the entire estate via intestacy [9]. Therefore, the inquiry into the brothers' hereditary rights was proper to determine their lack of standing and to accelerate proceedings [10].

**Disposition:** Order affirmed [5].
