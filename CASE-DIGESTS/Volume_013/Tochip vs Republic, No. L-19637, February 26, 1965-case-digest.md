**I. CAPTION**
**FELIPE TOCHIP v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-19637, February 26, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Felipe Tochip, a single citizen of the Republic of China born in Samar, filed a petition for naturalization. He claimed to be a purchasing agent and an insurance underwriter, reporting an income of P3,240.00 for the year 1960. He finished his high school education at the Philippine Chinese School in Manila. The Court of First Instance of Samar granted his petition on January 13, 1962. The Republic appealed, questioning the sufficiency of his income and his qualifications. Evidence revealed that his actual annual salary as a purchasing agent was only P1,800.00, while the rest of his income was derived from commissions.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative occupation to qualify for naturalization.
2. W/N the petitioner's enrollment in a Chinese school is consistent with the requirement to mingle socially with Filipinos and embrace their customs.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner’s income was insufficient to be considered lucrative. Although he reported a higher gross income in 1960 and 1961, his fixed annual salary was only P1,800.00. The additional income derived from commissions as an insurance underwriter is "too speculative and precarious" to constitute a lucrative occupation within the meaning of the law, even for a single applicant with no family to support [1].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner's completion of secondary education in a Philippine Chinese School argues against a sincere desire to embrace Filipino customs and traditions. It further militates against the legal requirement that an applicant must mingle socially with Filipinos, as he could have pursued his education in schools owned or run by Filipino citizens [2].

The decision of the Court of First Instance is **REVERSED**.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None.
