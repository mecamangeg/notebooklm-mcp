I. CAPTION
EUSEBIO TAÑALA v. MARIANO LEGASPI, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22537, March 31, 1965, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Eusebio Tañala, a sanitary inspector in Tacloban City, was suspended on May 6, 1954, following administrative and criminal complaints for malversation. The Commissioner of Civil Service dismissed him on February 19, 1955, based on his conviction by the Court of First Instance (CFI). However, the Court of Appeals acquitted him on October 2, 1956. Consequently, the Commissioner modified the penalty to "resigned without prejudice to reinstatement." Tañala appealed to the Civil Service Board of Appeals, which dismissed his appeal, and finally to the President. On March 21, 1960, the President reversed the decisions and ordered Tañala's immediate reinstatement.

Respondents, the Provincial and City Health Officers, refused to reinstate him, arguing that under the new Civil Service Law (R.A. 2260), the President lacked review powers, and that Tañala had already reached the compulsory retirement age of 65 on December 8, 1959. Another person had also been appointed to the position. Tañala filed a petition for mandamus with the CFI of Leyte, which ruled in his favor, ordering reinstatement and payment of back salaries. Respondents appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the President had the authority to order the petitioner's reinstatement despite the enactment of the new Civil Service Law (R.A. 2260).
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to reinstatement and back salaries despite reaching the compulsory retirement age and the position being filled by another.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the law applicable is the one existing at the time of the suspension or removal. Since Tañala was separated from service in 1957, prior to the effectivity of R.A. 2260 in 1959, the Old Civil Service Law (Revised Administrative Code) applies [1, 2]. Under the old law, the President has the power to review, modify, or reverse decisions of the Civil Service Board of Appeals *motu proprio* (*Negado v. Castro*). Thus, the President's order of reinstatement was valid and prevailed over the Commissioner's decision [1, 3].

2. **YES.** An illegally suspended or dismissed employee is considered as not having left his office; legally speaking, the position never became vacant (*Batungbakal v. National Development Co.*) [4]. Therefore, the temporary incumbent must give way. Furthermore, although Tañala cannot physically return to service having reached the age of 65, he is entitled to all rights and privileges of the office. The Court ruled he is considered reinstated as of the date he turned 65 (December 9, 1959) for the purpose of receiving back salaries from the date of his suspension and all retirement benefits due to him (*Tan v. Gimenez*) [5, 6].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
