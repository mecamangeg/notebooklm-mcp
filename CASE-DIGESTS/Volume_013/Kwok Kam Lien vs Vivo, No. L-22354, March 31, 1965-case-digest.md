I. CAPTION
KWOK KAM LIEN, ET AL. v. THE HON. MARTINIANO P. VIVO, as Acting Commissioner of Immigration, G.R. No. L-22354, March 31, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners are Chinese citizens who entered the Philippines as "temporary visitors" and secured several extensions [1]. In February 1962, responding to the administration's solicitation for foreign capital, they requested the President to allow them to invest in the country [2]. While these requests were pending, they sought further extensions of their stay [2]. On July 31, 1962, the President denied the requests, stating there was no legal basis for indefinite extension and that foreigners could invest without taking up residence [3]. Subsequently, Respondent Commissioner of Immigration Martiniano P. Vivo issued Immigration Circular No. 101, terminating the authorized stay of bonded alien temporary visitors who arrived in 1961 or prior, ordering them to leave by September 19, 1962 [4].

Petitioners filed a petition for Prohibition and Mandamus with Preliminary Injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, claiming the Circular was arbitrary and unconstitutional [5]. The CFI granted a preliminary injunction and allowed petitioners to deposit extension fees with the court [5]. The trial court ruled in favor of petitioners, holding that the government's invitation for foreign capital changed their status from temporary visitors to special non-immigrants under Section 47(a)2 of the Immigration Act [6, 7]. The Commissioner appealed [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the President's invitation for foreign capital automatically changed the petitioners' status from temporary visitors to special non-immigrants under Section 47(a)2 of the Immigration Act.
2. W/N the petitioners are entitled to withdraw the deposits made in lieu of extension fees.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the intention of the President to admit aliens as non-immigrants under Section 47(a)2 cannot be assumed [8]. The directive explicitly stated there was no legal basis for granting the requests for indefinite extension [3, 9]. The Court held that an invitation for foreign capital and subsequent investment by alien temporary visitors does not automatically change their status to special non-immigrants without "the most convincing and positive proof" of the President's intent [8, 9]. Furthermore, citing *Shui Shua Man v. Galang*, the Court noted that a change of status to pre-arranged employee or investor does not alter the character of the stay as a temporary visitor subject to deportation upon expiration [10].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the deposits were made in lieu of extension fees, and since the petitioners succeeded in prolonging their stay in the Philippines by virtue of these deposits, the fees properly belong to the government [11, 12]. The lower court erred in authorizing their withdrawal as the petitioners had no right to the money [12].

**Disposition:** The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**. Petitioners are declared without right to stay, the injunction is dissolved, and they are ordered to pay the government the withdrawn amount plus monthly extension fees until departure [13].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Bengzon and Justices Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., and Zaldivar concurred [14].
