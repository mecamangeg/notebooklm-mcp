I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF SAW CEN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. SAW CEN vs. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20310, April 30, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On August 29, 1961, Saw Cen, a Chinese citizen, filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Manila [1]. During the proceedings, it was established that Saw Cen had previously used the alias "Tan Hu Chi" and that his first five children used the surname "Tan" [2], [3]. Although he claimed to have stopped using the alias ten years prior knowing it was prohibited by law, this alias was not included in his petition or its subsequent publication [3]. Furthermore, one of his character witnesses, Tanchoco, was an accountant for companies managed by Saw Cen and admitted to knowing him only on a business level, without knowledge of his social life or family [4]. The trial court granted the petition, and the Republic appealed [5], [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the non-inclusion of the petitioner's alias in the publication of the petition is a fatal defect.
2. W/N the character witnesses presented satisfied the legal requirements for credibility.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The non-inclusion of the alias is a fatal defect. The Supreme Court held that omitting the alias in the publication deprives any person who knows the petitioner by that name of the opportunity to come forward and inform the authorities of matters affecting the application [3]. As such, the publication was incomplete and insufficient, effectively removing the trial court's jurisdiction to take cognizance of the petition [3].

2. **NO.** The character witnesses did not measure up to the requirements of the law. Citing *Ong vs. Republic*, the Court explained that a "credible person" must have good standing, be honest, and be trustworthy to serve as an insurer of the petitioner's character [6]. In this case, the witness Tanchoco was an employee of the petitioner, indicating potential partiality, and their relationship was purely business [4]. There was a paucity of evidence regarding intimate social relations, rendering the witness incompetent to vouch for the petitioner's worthiness [4].

The decision of the lower court is REVERSED and the petition is DENIED [7].
