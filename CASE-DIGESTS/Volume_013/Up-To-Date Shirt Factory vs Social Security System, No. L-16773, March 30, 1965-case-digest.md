I. CAPTION
UP-TO-DATE SHIRT FACTORY v. SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-16773, March 30, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On January 22, 1958, the Social Security System (SSS) notified Up-To-Date Shirt Factory (Petitioner) of its compulsory coverage effective September 1957 [1]. Petitioner objected, arguing it had not been in operation for at least two years prior to September 1957 as required by Section 9 of Republic Act 1161 [1, 2]. Petitioner claimed that while the business was established as a sole proprietorship under Kee Boc in April 1947, it was converted into a partnership only in April 1957 (or June 1958 per SSS findings); thus, the partnership entity had not existed for two years [2-4]. The Social Security Commission ruled that the Petitioner was covered. Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as there were no factual issues [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the conversion of a business from a single proprietorship to a partnership interrupts the continuity of operation for the purpose of the two-year period exemption under the Social Security Act.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the conversion of a single proprietorship into a partnership does not dissolve the continuity of the business operation where the evidence shows no change in the business except for the form of organization [4, 6].

The Court observed that the process was "painless": the trade name, nature of business, assets, liabilities, and employees remained the same, with Kee Boc continuing management [4]. Citing *Laguna Transportation Co. Inc. v. Social Security System*, the Court ruled that to accept the Petitioner's argument would allow employers to circumvent the statute by simply changing their form of organization every two years to claim exemption, thereby defeating the purpose of the Social Security Act [6, 7]. Consequently, the Petitioner was deemed to have been in operation for at least two years prior to September 1, 1957 [7].

Resolution affirmed [8].
