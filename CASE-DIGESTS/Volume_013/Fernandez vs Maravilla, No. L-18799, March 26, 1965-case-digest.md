I. CAPTION
HON. JOSE F. FERNANDEZ, Judge of Court of First Instance, Negros Occidental, ASUNCION MARAVILLA, ET AL. v. HERMINIO MARAVILLA, G.R. No. L-18799, March 26, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
The case involves the settlement of an estate valued at over P200,000. The trial court appointed Eliezar Lopez as co-special administrator to work alongside respondent Herminio Maravilla [1, 2]. The Court of Appeals initially set aside Lopez’s appointment, but the Supreme Court, acting on a Second Motion for Reconsideration by the petitioners, issued a Resolution on December 28, 1964, sustaining the trial court’s order appointing Lopez pending the final determination of the main case (G.R. No. L-23225) [2, 3].

Respondent Maravilla filed a Motion for Reconsideration against this Resolution, arguing that the trial court acted arbitrarily by denying him the opportunity to present evidence on why Lopez should not be appointed [4]. During the pendency of this incident, hostility arose between the co-administrators, leading to confusion and the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order by the Supreme Court against a trial court order dated February 15, 1965 [5]. Counsel for Maravilla offered to withdraw Maravilla's appointment in favor of an impartial third party to save the estate from further confusion [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the case should be remanded to the trial court to reconsider the appointment of the co-special administrator in light of supervening hostilities.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that while the appointment of a co-special administrator is primarily within the sound discretion of the trial court, the supervening developments—specifically the confusion resulting from the hostility between the co-administrators—justified reconsidering the entire matter [6].

The Court ruled that the previous Resolution sustaining Lopez’s appointment was subject to change if "a different set of circumstances... would justify another action" [6]. Recognizing that joint administration requires coordination which was absent in this case, the Court determined the fair solution was to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings [6, 7]. The High Court expressly suggested that the trial court give due consideration to Maravilla's offer to withdraw in favor of an impartial third party, as this would protect the interests of both parties [6].

Accordingly, the case was ordered **REMANDED** to the court of origin for further proceedings in consonance with the views expressed in the decision [8].
