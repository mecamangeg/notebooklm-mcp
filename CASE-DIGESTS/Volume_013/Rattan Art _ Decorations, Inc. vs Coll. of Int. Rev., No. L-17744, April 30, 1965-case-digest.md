I. CAPTION
RATTAN ART & DECORATIONS, INC. v. THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-17744, April 30, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rattan Art & Decorations, Inc., a manufacturer of rattan articles, sold goods to foreign buyers on "F.O.B. Manila" terms [1, 2]. The packing expenses were charged to the buyers, and the freight charges and insurance were paid by the buyers at the destination [3]. Payments were made in dollars via drafts or letters of credit [3]. The Collector of Internal Revenue assessed deficiency sales taxes for the period 1949–1952, treating the transactions as domestic sales [4, 5]. Petitioner contested the assessment, arguing the transactions were foreign export sales consummated outside the Philippines and thus exempt, and that the dollar payments indicated they were foreign trades [2, 6]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled that the sales were consummated in the Philippines and taxable, though it declared the tax liability for 1949 and the first quarter of 1950 had prescribed [7-9]. Petitioner appealed, further arguing that Republic Act No. 894, which later exempted such export sales, should apply retroactively [6, 10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the sales to foreign buyers on F.O.B. Manila terms are domestic sales subject to percentage sales tax.
2. W/N Republic Act No. 894 applies retroactively to exempt the subject transactions.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The sales are domestic and subject to tax. Under Section 186 of the Tax Code (prior to amendment), the tax is imposed on sales consummated in the Philippines, which occurs where title passes [11, 12]. The fact that terms were F.O.B. Manila, and expenses for packing, freight, and insurance were borne by the buyers, indicates that title to the goods transferred to the buyers the moment the seller placed the goods aboard the ship in Manila [13-15]. The payment in dollars does not alter the result or make the transaction a foreign sale exempt from tax [6, 8, 11].

2. **NO.** Republic Act No. 894 has no retroactive effect. Tax laws operate prospectively unless a retroactive effect is expressly declared or clearly implied [16, 17]. The government had already acquired a vested right in the taxes due from the petitioner before the exempting statute was enacted [18]. The Court relied on *Misamis Lumber Co., Inc. v. The Coll. of Int. Rev.* to rule that transactions occurring before the effectivity of R.A. 894 are not covered by the exemption [18].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED [17].
