I. CAPTION
DAVID DELFIN v. COURT OF APPEALS, PHILIPPINE CHARITY SWEEPSTAKES OFFICE, ILOILO CITY FISCAL and HON. JESUS S. RODRIGUEZ, G.R. No. L-21022, February 27, 1965, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
On May 24, 1960, the City Fiscal of Iloilo charged petitioner David Delfin, a Sales Supervisor of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO), with "malversation of public funds" for allegedly misappropriating P20,058.29 worth of sweepstakes tickets [1]. After the prosecution presented its evidence, Delfin moved to dismiss the information, arguing that PCSO is a private office and its funds are not public; thus, the elements of "public officer" and "public funds" were lacking [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance denied the motion, ruling that a *prima facie* case was established [2]. Delfin filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus with the Court of Appeals to compel the dismissal, but the CA denied the petition [2, 3]. Delfin appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court gravely abused its discretion in denying the motion to dismiss the information for malversation.
2. W/N the extraordinary remedies of prohibition and mandamus are proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The trial court did not gravely abuse its discretion. Even assuming the petitioner's theory is correct—that PCSO employees are not public officers and its funds are not public—the information filed is still sufficient to sustain a conviction for a lesser offense, namely, *estafa* [4]. The Supreme Court held that *estafa* is a lesser, cognate offense in relation to malversation; thus, a person charged with malversation of public funds can validly be convicted of *estafa* if the funds are proven to be private [4]. This aligns with the doctrine in *U.S. v. Solis* [4].

2. **NO.** Prohibition and mandamus are not available where the petitioner has an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, which in this case is an appeal in due time [5]. For prohibition to lie based on grave abuse of discretion, the lower court's exercise of judgment must be capricious, whimsical, or despotic [6]. Citing *Solidum v. Hernandez*, the Court reiterated that the denial of a motion to dismiss or quash should be raised on appeal from the final decision rather than through extraordinary writs, as appeal constitutes a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy [5, 7].

The judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED [8].
