I. CAPTION
**NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and TOMAS MENDOZA**, G.R. No. L-20504, March 31, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Isabelina Mendoza was employed by the National Development Company (NDC) as a machine operator. She contracted tuberculosis and was hospitalized in 1956 but returned to work. On May 13, 1957, after she was hit by a machine and spat blood, an X-ray revealed she was suffering from active and advanced tuberculosis, a fact known to the company physician who advised hospitalization [1], [2], [3]. She was laid off effective June 15, 1957 [2]. Although she made a verbal demand for compensation in August 1957, the formal written notice of injury and claim was not received by NDC until September 5, 1960, over three years later [3]. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) granted the claim [2]. NDC appealed, arguing that the claim was barred under Section 24 of Act No. 3428 (Workmen’s Compensation Act) because it was filed beyond the prescribed two-month period [2], [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the claim for compensation is barred by the employee's failure to file the notice of injury and claim within the statutory period under Section 24 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the WCC's decision. Under Section 45, paragraph 2 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, the employer is obligated to file a notice of controversion with the Commissioner on or before the fourteenth day of disability or ten days from knowledge of the accident [4], [5]. In this case, NDC knew of the employee's illness on May 13, 1957 but failed to file the required notice [3], [4]. The Court held that the employer's obligation to controvert under Section 45 is independent of the employee's obligation to file a claim under Section 24 [5]. Consequently, NDC's failure to comply with Section 45 resulted in the statutory renunciation of its right to controvert the claim, barring all defenses, including the employee's failure to file the claim on time [4], [6].

**Decision affirmed.**
