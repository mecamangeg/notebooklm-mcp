I. CAPTION
CROMWELL COMMERCIAL EMPLOYEES AND LABORERS UNION (PTUC) v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and CROMWELL COMMERCIAL CO., INC., G.R. No. L-19778, February 26, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
The Supreme Court previously rendered a decision on September 30, 1964, affirming the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). The Court ruled that while employees dismissed for discrimination and those striking against unfair labor practices (ULP) are entitled to reinstatement, only the discriminatorily dismissed employees are entitled to backwages. Voluntary strikers are generally not entitled to backwages. The CIR also awarded only half backwages to certain reinstated salesmen because they had refused to turn over collections to the company. The Union filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the CIR had no discretion to award only half backwages and should have granted full backpay. The Union further contended that the strikers were justified because the company blocked the formation of a grievance committee, violating the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the reinstated salesmen and voluntary strikers are entitled to full backwages.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court denied the Motion for Reconsideration.

Regarding the salesmen, the Court held that awarding half backwages was proper because said employees were "not exactly justified in refusing to turn over their collections to the company" [1, 2]. Furthermore, the Union failed to raise this error in their initial assignment of errors [2].

Regarding the voluntary strikers, the Court reiterated the rule that even if a strike is in protest of ULP, strikers are not entitled to backwages. The exception—based on the *American Manufacturing* case—applies only when strikers "abandon the strike and apply for reinstatement despite the unfair labor practice," and the employer either refuses reinstatement or imposes new discriminatory conditions [3, 4]. Here, the strikers did not abandon the strike; they insisted on the company's observance of the CBA as a condition for returning to work [3]. Consequently, they did not fall under the exception entitling them to backpay.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Reyes, J.B.L., J. (Dissenting):** Voted to grant reconsideration. He argued that the "no-strike" clause in the CBA was dependent on the existence of a grievance committee, which the employer blocked. Thus, the employer breached the contract first and cannot enforce the no-strike clause [5]. He also argued the *American Manufacturing* rule should apply to grant backpay because the employees were effectively provoked into striking and were refused readmission except on the company's terms [6, 7].
