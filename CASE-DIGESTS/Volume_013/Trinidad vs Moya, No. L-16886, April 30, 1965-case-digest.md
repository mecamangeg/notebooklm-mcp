I. CAPTION
ANACLETO TRINIDAD and DIONISIO BARROGA v. HON. JOSE L. MOYA and MUNICIPALITY OF IRIGA, G.R. No. L-16886, April 30, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On December 11, 1959, the Municipality of Iriga, through then-Mayor Tanduran, leased the Iriga Central Market to petitioner Trinidad and the Sagrada Market to petitioner Barroga for a one-year term starting January 1, 1960 [1]. On February 16, 1960, the Municipality filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 4836) to annul the lease contracts, alleging that Mayor Tanduran, having lost his re-election bid, connived with petitioners to defraud the municipality by leasing the markets at patently unreasonable rates [2]. The Municipality prayed for the issuance *ex parte* of a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain petitioners from collecting market fees during the pendency of the action, claiming continued collection by private individuals would cause irreparable injury [2]. Respondent Judge Moya issued the writ *ex parte* on March 22, 1960 [3]. Petitioners moved to set aside the order, and upon denial, filed this petition for certiorari alleging grave abuse of discretion [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the writ of preliminary injunction *ex parte*.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that while the general rule requires notice before issuing a preliminary injunction, the Rules of Court grant the court discretion to issue the writ *ex parte* if the petitioner shows they will suffer irreparable injury if the writ is not issued immediately [4]. Here, the trial court found that if the petitioners continued administering the markets and collecting fees, the Municipality would suffer irreparable injury because there was no assurance it could recover the collected amounts should the lease contracts be finally annulled [5]. The Supreme Court reiterated its policy not to interfere with the trial court's exercise of discretion unless clearly abused, a circumstance not present in this case [5].

The writ prayed for was denied [6].
