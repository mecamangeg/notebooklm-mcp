I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FORTUNATO MENDOZA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16392, January 30, 1965, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On March 6, 1958, inmates Lorenzo Villanueva and Copia Mansaka surrendered to prison authorities at the New Bilibid Prison, admitting they killed fellow inmate Epifanio Paison. In their extrajudicial confessions, they detailed how they planned the killing to avenge a previous altercation. They narrated that they tricked their way into the victim's brigade (Brigade 3B) by pretending to be "rancheros" (food carriers) pushing a meal cart. Upon finding Paison, they took him to a toilet and stabbed him to death; Villanueva also cut off the victim's right ear.

However, during the trial, both accused retracted their confessions and claimed self-defense. They alleged that Paison attacked Villanueva with a knife, which Villanueva wrested and used to stab Paison, and that Paison subsequently attacked Mansaka with an ice pick. The Court of First Instance of Rizal rejected their defense, convicted them of murder, and sentenced them to death.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused can validly claim self-defense.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court rejected the plea of self-defense. The justifying circumstance of self-defense may be accepted only when it is established that the accused did not initiate the unlawful aggression. Here, the accused were clearly the aggressors, having used craft to gain unauthorized entry into the victim's brigade to carry out a premeditated assassination [1, 2].

Furthermore, self-defense is an affirmative allegation that must be established by positive evidence and convincing credibility (*People v. Apolinario*). The physical evidence contradicted their claim: the victim suffered 15 severe wounds and a severed ear, while Villanueva had only superficial scratches and Mansaka was unharmed [3]. The Court also found their narrative—that they fought the victim one at a time and that Villanueva walked away to bandage his arm while the fight continued—inherently incredible [4, 5]. The crime was Murder qualified by evident premeditation and attended by aggravating circumstances of reiteration/recidivism, ignominy, craft, and insult to public authorities, with only voluntary surrender as mitigating [6, 7].

**Decision affirmed.**
