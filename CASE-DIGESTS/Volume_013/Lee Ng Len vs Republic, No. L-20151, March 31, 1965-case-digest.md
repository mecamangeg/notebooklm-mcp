I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF LEE NG LEN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. LEE NG LEN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-20151, March 31, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lee Ng Len, born in Pasay City in 1939, filed a petition for naturalization. He completed his primary education at the Manila Chinese School, secondary education at the University of Sto. Tomas, and was studying at the Mapua Institute of Technology. He did not file a declaration of intention, claiming exemption due to his birth in the Philippines and completion of education in local schools. In his petition, he only listed his present residence at 479 Herran, Manila, and did not disclose other names he used. The Court of First Instance of Manila granted the petition. The Republic appealed, questioning his exemption from the declaration of intention and noting defects in the petition regarding his undisclosed former residences and aliases [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a declaration of intention.
2. W/N the failure to disclose all former places of residence and aliases is fatal to the petition.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 6 of the Naturalization Law, to be exempt from filing a declaration of intention, a Philippine-born applicant must prove that the schools they attended were not limited to any race or nationality. The petitioner failed to prove that the Manila Chinese School was not limited to Chinese students; in fact, its name imports such limitation (*Wang I Fu v. Republic*). The burden of proof lies with the applicant to show that the school is regularly attended by a sizable number of Filipinos to ensure the imbibing of Filipino customs. Having failed to prove this, the petitioner was required to file a declaration of intention [2].

2. **YES.** The failure to specify all former places of residence is fatal to the petition (*Keng Giok v. Republic*). The evidence showed petitioner previously resided at 145 Herran, 806 Sta. Mesa, and Pasay City, which were not listed in the petition. Furthermore, the petitioner failed to disclose aliases used in school certificates ("Allen N. Lee" and "Alien Ng Lee"). This failure taints the publication of the petition and warrants reversal (*Yu Seco v. Republic*) [3].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision of the court below is reversed, and the petition for naturalization is ordered dismissed [4].
