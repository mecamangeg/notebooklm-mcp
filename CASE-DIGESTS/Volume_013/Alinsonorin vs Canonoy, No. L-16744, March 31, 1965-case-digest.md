I. CAPTION
SIMPLICIO ALINSONORIN v. MATEO M. CANONOY and ANDREA SALUD, G.R. No. L-16744, March 31, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Andrea Salud filed a complaint for separation of property against her husband, petitioner Simplicio Alinsonorin [1]. The trial court rendered a decision ordering Alinsonorin to pay Salud P20.00 monthly as her liquidated share of the produce of the conjugal properties [2]. This judgment became final and executory [3]. However, Alinsonorin failed to pay the allowance, prompting Salud to file a motion to declare him in contempt of court [2].

During the hearing, Alinsonorin claimed inability to pay because he had sold the conjugal properties to their grandson for P3,000.00 [2]. Resolving the motion for contempt, respondent Judge Canonoy issued an order on January 12, 1960, requiring Alinsonorin to deposit the P3,000.00 sale proceeds in court and to pay Salud’s monthly pension from said deposit [4]. Alinsonorin filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that the judge lacked jurisdiction and that the order constituted an invalid modification of a final judgment [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court had jurisdiction to order the deposit of sale proceeds and payment of pension therefrom in resolving a motion for contempt.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the respondent judge had the authority to issue the contested order [3]. Since the judgment requiring the monthly payment of P20.00 had become final, it was the judge's duty to ensure it was faithfully carried out [3]. The Court found that Alinsonorin sold the conjugal properties specifically to avoid complying with his duty under the judgment [3]. Consequently, it was within the judge's authority to order the deposit of the proceeds and require their use to pay the amount due to the wife [3]. The Court held that granting this relief in a contempt proceeding was proper, as it served as a means to compel compliance with the final judgment [3].

The petition was dismissed and the writ denied [6].
