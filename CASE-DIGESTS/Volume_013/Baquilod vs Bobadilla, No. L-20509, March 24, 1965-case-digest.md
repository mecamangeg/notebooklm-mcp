I. CAPTION
LESME BAQUILOD, et al. v. HON. MARCELO M. BOBADILLA, et al., G.R. No. L-20509, March 24, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Baquilod, et al. were involved in an election protest originating from the November 1959 elections for the positions of municipal councilors of Borongan, Samar [1]. The case reached the Supreme Court, but during the pendency of the proceedings, the term of office for the contested positions expired with the year 1963, and new elections were held in November of that same year [1]. On November 17, 1964, the Supreme Court issued a resolution requiring the parties to show cause within ten (10) days why the case should not be dismissed due to these developments [1]. The period lapsed without any action or response from either party [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the election protest should be dismissed for being moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that since new elections were held in 1963, all questions relating to the 1959 election automatically became academic [2]. The Court further reasoned that the parties' inaction regarding the show-cause resolution served as proof of their acquiescence to the dismissal of the case [2]. Consequently, the issues having become moot, the case was dismissed [2].
