I. CAPTION
GONZALO P. NAVA v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-19470, January 30, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On May 15, 1951, petitioner Gonzalo P. Nava filed his income tax return for 1950 and was assessed a tax of P4,952.00. He paid half but failed to pay the balance of P2,491.00, attempting unsuccessfully to pay via backpay certificates. On March 30, 1955, the respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) allegedly issued a deficiency income tax assessment requiring payment of P9,124.50 (inclusive of the unpaid balance and surcharge). However, Nava claimed he only learned of this new assessment on December 19, 1956—more than five years after filing his return. He protested the assessment as prescribed. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled against Nava, presuming he received the March 30, 1955 notice in the regular course of mail based on a duplicate copy in BIR files and notations of "call-up" letters, despite the lack of direct proof of mailing.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the government's right to enforce the tax assessment has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CTA decision, ruling that the assessment had prescribed. Under Section 331 of the Tax Code, the government had five years from the filing of the return (May 15, 1951) to make a valid assessment. The Court held that while an assessment is deemed made when sent within the prescribed period, the release, mailing, or sending of the notice must be clearly and satisfactorily proved.

Here, the CIR failed to prove that the assessment notice dated March 30, 1955, was actually mailed or released. The presumption that a letter duly directed and mailed was received in the regular course of mail (Sec. 5[v], Rule 131) did not apply because the CIR failed to establish the necessary facts: (a) that the letter was properly addressed with postage prepaid, and (b) that it was mailed. The CIR's witnesses had no personal knowledge of the mailing, and mere notations on BIR records made without the taxpayer's intervention were insufficient evidence. Since the earliest effective notice was established only on December 19, 1956, the five-year prescriptive period expiring on May 15, 1956, had already lapsed.

Petition granted; decision reversed.
