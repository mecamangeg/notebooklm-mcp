I. CAPTION
ZOSIMO D. UY v. JOSE R. ZAMORA and THE ALLIED FINANCE, INC., G.R. No. L-19482, March 31, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellant Zosimo D. Uy sued defendant Jose R. Zamora for a sum of money. On August 11, 1960, Uy obtained a writ of attachment covering a motor vehicle owned by Zamora [1, 2]. Subsequently, Allied Finance, Inc. intervened, claiming preference over the vehicle based on a Deed of Chattel Mortgage executed by Zamora in its favor on January 14, 1960, and notarized on June 20, 1960 [1, 3]. However, this mortgage was only registered in the Chattel Mortgage Register on August 24, 1960 [1, 2]. The vehicle was sold for P2,500 to prevent depreciation, but the proceeds were insufficient to satisfy both Uy's claim (P2,500 based on a compromise) and the Intervenor's claim (P2,451.93) [1, 4].

The lower court ruled in favor of the Intervenor, holding that while the mortgage was not a specially preferred credit under Article 2241(4) due to lack of timely registration, it was still a credit appearing in a public instrument under Article 2244(14) of the Civil Code [5]. Since the mortgage was notarized on June 20, 1960, prior to Uy's attachment on August 11, 1960, the lower court gave it preference [5]. Uy appealed [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a chattel mortgage registered after the issuance of a writ of attachment is preferred over the attachment lien.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that the credit of a mortgage of a motor vehicle cannot be considered preferred until it has been recorded in the Motor Vehicles Office [2]. To affect third persons like the plaintiff, a mortgage of motor vehicles must be registered in the Chattel Mortgage Registry and recorded in the Motor Vehicles Office (now Land Transportation Office) [2].

Since Allied Finance, Inc. registered its mortgage only on August 24, 1960—subsequent to the writ of attachment obtained by Uy on August 11, 1960—the Intervenor's credit cannot prevail over the plaintiff's attachment lien [2]. The Court rejected the lower court's application of Article 2244 regarding public instruments, stating it was untenable because the intervenor's credit could not be considered preferred until properly recorded [2]. Citing *Borlough v. Fortune Enterprises, Inc.*, the Court ruled that Uy's credit must be paid first [2].

The decision of the lower court was **REVERSED** [6].
