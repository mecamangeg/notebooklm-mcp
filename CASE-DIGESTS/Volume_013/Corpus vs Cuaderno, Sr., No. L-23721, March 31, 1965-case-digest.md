I. CAPTION
R. MARINO CORPUS v. MIGUEL CUADERNO, SR., ET AL., G.R. No. L-23721, March 31, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner R. Marino Corpus held the position of "Special Assistant to the Governor, In Charge of the Export Department" at the Central Bank, a position declared by the President as "highly technical" in nature. On March 7, 1958, administrative charges were filed against him for dishonesty and incompetence, leading to his suspension by the Monetary Board (MB). However, the investigating committee found no basis for disciplinary action and recommended his immediate reinstatement. Despite this, on July 20, 1959, the MB approved a resolution considering Corpus "resigned" based on the Governor's "loss of confidence," arguing that his position was primarily confidential and highly technical.

Corpus filed a petition for certiorari, mandamus, and quo warranto with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI ruled the MB resolution null and void, ordered Corpus's reinstatement, and awarded him P5,000.00 in attorney’s fees. Both parties appealed; the respondents questioned the reinstatement, while Corpus argued he was entitled to P20,000.00 in fees per his contract with his lawyer.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N an official holding a "highly technical" position may be removed on the ground of loss of confidence.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to recover the full amount of attorney’s fees stipulated in the contract with his counsel.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Constitution and the Civil Service Law distinguish between positions that are "primarily confidential" and those that are "highly technical" [1]. While the tenure of officials in primarily confidential positions ends upon loss of confidence, this rule does not apply to highly technical positions [1]. "Highly technical" officers are protected by the Civil Service and cannot be removed or suspended except for cause as provided by law [2]. To allow removal based on loss of confidence for highly technical positions would negate the merit system and deny security of tenure to experts [1]. Furthermore, the Court found that the alleged "loss of confidence" was merely an afterthought resorted to by the Board when the administrative charges against the petitioner could not be substantiated [3].

2. **NO.** An agreement regarding attorney's fees between a client and his lawyer cannot bind the adverse party who is a stranger to the fee contract [4]. While the Civil Code allows a party to recover reasonable counsel fees by way of damages, the determination of such fees lies primarily within the discretion of the trial court, and no abuse of discretion was shown in awarding only P5,000.00 [4].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Bengzon, J.P., J. (Concurring):** Agreed with the decision because the "loss of confidence" was clearly an afterthought used when charges were not proven. However, he reserved his view on whether loss of confidence could ever be a lawful ground for dismissal from a highly technical position in other cases where the nature of the work might require utmost confidence (e.g., scientists dealing with state secrets) [6-8].
