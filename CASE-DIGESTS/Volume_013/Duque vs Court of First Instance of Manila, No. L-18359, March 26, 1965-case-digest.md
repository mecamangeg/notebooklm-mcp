I. CAPTION
**CALIXTO DUQUE, et al. v. THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, et al.**, G.R. No. L-18359, and **PILAR NORMANDY, et al. v. HON. FRANCISCO ARCA, et al.**, G.R. No. L-23754, March 26, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In Civil Case No. 34998, a derivative suit was filed by minority stockholders (Normandy, Camins, et al.) of World War Veterans Enterprises, Inc. against its directors (Duque, et al.) to annul certain agreements [1].

In G.R. No. L-18359, Duque, et al. sought certiorari against the CFI's refusal to suspend the initial receiver, Ramon Saura [2]. However, Saura resigned on May 28, 1964, and the resignation was accepted by the lower court [3].

In G.R. No. L-23754, following Saura's resignation, the trial court (Judge Arca) appointed Macario Ofilada, the Clerk of Court, as permanent receiver [4], [5]. Petitioners Camins and Normandy opposed this, citing Ofilada's official duties and alleged partiality, and proposed the Philippine Veterans Bank as receiver instead [3], [6]. The trial court denied the proposal and confirmed Ofilada's appointment. The petitioners filed for certiorari alleging grave abuse of discretion [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition in G.R. No. L-18359 regarding the suspension of receiver Saura is moot.
2. W/N the trial court gravely abused its discretion in appointing the Clerk of Court as permanent receiver instead of the Philippine Veterans Bank.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that G.R. No. L-18359 became academic when receiver Ramon Saura resigned and his resignation was accepted by the trial court. Consequently, the case was dismissed [3], [7].

2. **NO.** The appointment and discharge of receivers are matters primarily addressed to, and resting largely on, the discretion of the trial court [8]. The Supreme Court will not interfere unless convinced that such discretion has been abused (*Sanson v. Araneta*, *Lama v. Apacible*) [8].

The Court found that the trial court did not act arbitrarily. Although the Supreme Court had noted Ofilada's "considerable official duties" in 1961 when appointing him provisionally, this did not preclude the trial court from determining three years later that he could efficiently perform as a permanent receiver [9]. Regarding charges of partiality, the trial court had heard and rejected them; even if the lower court's appraisal of facts was erroneous, it does not constitute grave abuse of discretion warranting certiorari (*Abad Santos v. Province of Tarlac*) [10]. Furthermore, new developments such as Ofilada's impending retirement should be presented to the trial court first for consideration [11].

In L-23754, the petition is denied. In L-18359, the case is dismissed [7].
