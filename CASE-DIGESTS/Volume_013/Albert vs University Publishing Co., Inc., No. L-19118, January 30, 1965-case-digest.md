I. CAPTION
MARIANO A. ALBERT v. UNIVERSITY PUBLISHING CO., INC., G.R. No. L-19118, January 30, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On July 19, 1948, Mariano A. Albert entered into a contract with "University Publishing Co., Inc.," represented by its President, Jose M. Aruego, for the publication of his legal commentaries. The company agreed to pay Albert P30,000.00 in installments but failed to pay the second installment. Albert sued the corporation for breach of contract. The Court of First Instance ruled in Albert's favor, and after appeals to the Supreme Court, the judgment awarding him P15,000.00 became final and executory.

However, when Albert sought a writ of execution, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) certified that "University Publishing Co., Inc." was not registered as a corporation or partnership. Consequently, Albert petitioned the lower court to execute the judgment against Jose M. Aruego personally, asserting he was the real defendant. The lower court denied the petition, accepting the counter-argument that Aruego was not a party to the case. Albert appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the judgment against a non-existent corporation may be executed against the person who acted as its representative (Jose M. Aruego).

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that Jose M. Aruego is personally liable for the judgment.

Since "University Publishing Co., Inc." was not registered with the SEC, it had no valid existence and no juridical personality separate from Aruego [1, 2]. Aruego cannot invoke the principle of "corporation by estoppel" because he was the one who wilfully misrepresented to the victim (Albert) that the corporation was duly organized (*Salvatiera v. Garlitos*) [2].

The Court applied the doctrine that a person acting or purporting to act on behalf of a non-existent corporation assumes its privileges and obligations and becomes personally liable for contracts entered into [3, 4]. Aruego was the real party in interest: he signed the contract, reaped its benefits, breached its terms, and effectively controlled the litigation proceedings [4, 5]. To deny execution against him on the technicality that he was not named in the caption would sacrifice justice to form. Due process was substantially observed because Aruego, having controlled the defense, effectively had his day in court (*Alonso v. Villamor*) [4, 6, 7].

The Order appealed from is SET ASIDE and the case REMANDED to the lower court for supplementary proceedings to execute the judgment against University Publishing Co., Inc. and/or Jose M. Aruego [8].
