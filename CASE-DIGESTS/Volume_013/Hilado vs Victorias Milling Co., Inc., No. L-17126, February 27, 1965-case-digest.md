I. CAPTION
ALFONSO HILADO v. VICTORIAS MILLING CO., INC. and CARLOS L. LOCSIN, G.R. No. L-17126, February 27, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In 1956, Carlos L. Locsin, in his capacity as President of Victorias Milling Co., Inc., offered Alfonso Hilado the position of Technical Assistant to the President [1]. Hilado accepted, resigning from his previous employment and moving his family, but his services were terminated on June 30, 1959 [1]. Hilado filed a complaint for damages against the corporation and Locsin, jointly and severally [1]. Locsin moved to dismiss the complaint against him on the ground that it stated no cause of action, arguing he acted in his official capacity and the corporation has a personality separate from its officers [2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint against Locsin [3]. Hilado appealed [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint against Locsin without giving the plaintiff an opportunity to amend it.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that while the complaint was deficient, the deficiency was curable [4]. The Court observed that the allegation that Locsin acted "in his capacity as President" rendered the cause of action against him personally doubtful, and the complaint failed to specify if he signed the termination notice in a personal or official capacity [5]. However, instead of dismissing the complaint outright, the lower court should have given the appellant a reasonable opportunity to amend his pleading [4].

The Order was set aside and the case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [6].
