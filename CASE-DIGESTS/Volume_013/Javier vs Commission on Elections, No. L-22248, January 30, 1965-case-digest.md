I. CAPTION
PATERNO JAVIER v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS and FELIX LOMUGDANG, G.R. No. L-22248, January 30, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
During the November 12, 1963 elections, Paterno Javier and Felix Lomugdang ran for mayor of Culasi, Antique. During canvassing, a discrepancy was found in Precinct No. 4: the election return credited Lomugdang with only 23 votes, while the tally board showed 83. The Board of Inspectors unanimously petitioned the Municipal Board of Canvassers (MBC) to correct the clerical error. The COMELEC representative instructed the MBC to suspend the canvass for mayor, but the MBC refused. The COMELEC then issued a telegraphic order on November 15, 1963, suspending the canvass and proclamation. Lomugdang also filed a petition for judicial recount in the Court of First Instance (CFI).

Despite the lawful orders and the pending case, the MBC proceeded with the canvass and proclaimed Javier as mayor. Consequently, the CFI dismissed Lomugdang’s recount petition because a winner had been proclaimed. On November 26, 1963, the COMELEC issued a resolution declaring Javier's proclamation null and void for violating its orders, suspending the MBC members, and authorizing the appointment of substitutes for a new canvass. Javier filed a petition with the Supreme Court, arguing the MBC was *functus officio* after the proclamation and that the CFI dismissal was *res judicata*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the COMELEC has the power to annul a proclamation made by the Board of Canvassers in defiance of its valid order to suspend canvassing.
2. W/N the Board of Canvassers becomes *functus officio* after proclaiming a winner, thereby precluding a new canvass.
3. W/N the dismissal of the petition for recount by the CFI constitutes *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A valid directive from the COMELEC suspending a proclamation renders any subsequent proclamation in violation thereof null and void. The discrepancy in the election return was clear on its face and attested to by the inspectors, making the suspension order imperative to allow for correction. Since the proclamation was void ab initio, the COMELEC acted within its authority to annul it and order a new canvass [1].

2. **NO.** The doctrine that a Board of Canvassers becomes *functus officio* after proclamation applies only when the board has performed its duty "according to law." It does not apply where the canvass and proclamation were made in violation of a lawful COMELEC order [2], [3]. The COMELEC retains the power to order a new canvass even after a proclamation if the return was wrongfully excluded or if the proclamation was not a faithful discharge of the board's ministerial duty [3]. Furthermore, defiance of lawful orders is a valid cause for the removal and substitution of board members [4].

3. **NO.** The CFI dismissed the recount petition based on the legal presumption that the proclamation was regular. Since the Supreme Court affirmed that the proclamation was null and void, the basis for the dismissal no longer exists. Therefore, the dismissal does not bar the available remedies for determining the true result of the election [4].

Petition dismissed [5].
