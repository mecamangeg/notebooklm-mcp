I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF HARRY ONG PING SENG TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. HARRY ONG PING SENG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19575, February 26, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Harry Ong Ping Seng filed a petition for naturalization, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Manila [1, 2]. The Republic appealed the decision, arguing that the petitioner failed to meet the statutory requirements [2]. A review of the records revealed several defects: (1) Ong Ping Seng declared a gross income of P8,800 for the year 1960 in his 1961 additional residence certificate, which was substantially lower than the P13,172.85 stated in his income tax return [3]; (2) his three children were enrolled in Hope Christian High School, an institution run by Chinese citizens with a student body consisting mainly of Chinese nationals [3]; (3) he failed to satisfactorily prove his knowledge of Tagalog during the trial [3]; and (4) his petition only listed his residence at Zurbaran Street, omitting prior residences at 285 Blumentritt, 631 Mayhaligue, and 589 Gandara in Manila [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner possesses the requisite good moral character and sincere desire to embrace Filipino customs.
2. W/N the failure to state all former places of residence in the petition is fatal to the application for naturalization.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner failed to satisfy these requirements. The discrepancy between the income declared in his residence certificate and his income tax return shows that his moral character is not as good as it should be [3, 4]. Furthermore, enrolling his children in a Chinese school indicates that he has not evinced a sincere desire to mingle socially with Filipinos and to embrace their customs, traditions, and ideals [3, 5].

2. **YES.** Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473, as amended) expressly requires a petitioner to state not only their present address but also all former places of residence [3]. The petitioner's failure to list his former residences in Blumentritt, Mayhaligue, and Gandara violates this provision and warrants the denial of the petition, consistent with jurisprudence in *Ong Tai v. Republic* and *Qua v. Republic* [3, 6].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is REVERSED and the petition is DISMISSED [6].
