I. CAPTION
SILVERIO ALMIRAÑEZ and ISIDRA VILLABONA v. GASPARA DEVERA, G.R. No. L-19496, February 27, 1965, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On August 10, 1931, Gaspara Devera sold Lot No. 1563 to Julian Villabona for P800.00 with a right to repurchase after two years [1]. Julian and his successors (son Primitivo and granddaughter Nimfa) took possession of the land and paid taxes thereon [1, 2]. In cadastral proceedings, the CFI adjudicated the lot to Devera in 1941, subject to the lien of the *pacto de retro* sale, which was annotated on Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. O-1738 issued to her in 1955 [2, 3].

Devera failed to repurchase the property [4]. In 1956, Nimfa sold the land to Spouses Almirañez (Appellees) [1]. In 1960, Appellees filed a motion in the cadastral court under Section 112 of Act 496 to consolidate ownership and cancel Devera's title [5]. Devera opposed, arguing that the cadastral court lacked jurisdiction to order consolidation and that the action was barred by *res judicata* and prescription [6, 7]. The CFI granted the motion, ordering the cancellation of Devera's title and the issuance of a new one to Appellees [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CFI, acting as a land registration court, has jurisdiction under Section 112 of Act 496 to order the consolidation of ownership and cancellation of title in favor of the vendee *a retro*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the CFI acted properly within its jurisdiction under Section 112 of Act 496 [9]. This section allows any "person in interest" to petition the court upon the ground that registered interests have "terminated and ceased" or that "new interests have arisen" [9].

Since the *pacto de retro* sale was validly recorded on the title and Devera failed to repurchase within the legal period, ownership was consolidated in the vendee by operation of law under Article 1509 of the Old Civil Code [10, 11]. Consequently, Devera’s interest as the registered owner had ceased [12].

The Court rejected the argument that relief under Section 112 requires "unanimity" or lack of opposition. It clarified that "unanimity" merely means the absence of a *serious controversy* regarding the title [13]. Here, no serious controversy existed because the lien was annotated on the title and Devera did not deny the sale or her failure to repurchase [14]. The motion was not barred by prescription because Section 112 allows a petition to be filed "at any time" based on a right recorded in the certificate of title [15].

Orders affirmed [16].
