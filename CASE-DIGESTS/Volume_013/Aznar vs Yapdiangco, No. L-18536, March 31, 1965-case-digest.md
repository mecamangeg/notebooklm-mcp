I. CAPTION
JOSE B. AZNAR v. RAFAEL YAPDIANGCO; TEODORO SANTOS (Intervenor), G.R. No. L-18536, March 31, 1965, Regala, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
In May 1959, Teodoro Santos advertised his Ford Fairlane 500 for sale. Vicente Marella agreed to buy the car for P14,700.00, with the understanding that payment would be made after the car was registered in his name [3, 4]. A deed of sale was executed and the car was registered to Marella, but the price remained unpaid. Santos instructed his son, Irineo, not to part with the registration papers until full payment was received [4, 5].

When Irineo demanded payment, Marella claimed he was short P2,000.00 and instructed his companion, L. De Dios, and Irineo to go to a sister's house to secure the balance. Marella also asked for the registration papers on the pretext of showing them to his lawyer; Irineo, trusting him, handed them over [5]. At the alleged sister's house, L. De Dios tricked Irineo into waiting inside while he and an unidentified companion disappeared with the car [6].

That same day, Marella sold the car to Jose B. Aznar for P15,000.00 [7]. While Aznar was registering the car, Philippine Constabulary agents seized it upon Santos' report of the theft [7]. Aznar filed a complaint for replevin against the police captain, Rafael Yapdiangco. Santos intervened, claiming ownership [8]. The trial court ruled in favor of Santos, finding he was unlawfully deprived of his property [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Teodoro Santos, the original owner unlawfully deprived of the car, has a better right to possession than Jose B. Aznar, a buyer in good faith. [9]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that Santos had a better right to the vehicle. Under Article 559 of the Civil Code, a person who has lost a movable or has been unlawfully deprived of it may recover it from any possessor, even if the latter acquired it in good faith [9, 10]. The only exception is if the possessor acquired the item at a public sale, which did not happen in this case [9].

Aznar argued that Article 1506 of the Civil Code should apply, which protects a buyer in good faith if the seller had a voidable title [11]. The Court rejected this, holding that Article 1506 is inapplicable because the seller, Marella, had no title at all [12]. Ownership is not transferred by contract merely but by tradition or delivery (Art. 712, Civil Code) [13]. Although there was a contract of sale, the car was never legally delivered to Marella; he effectively stole it while it was in the custody of Santos' son [14]. Since Marella never acquired valid title, he could not transfer ownership to Aznar.

Furthermore, the common law principle that the party who enabled the fraud via misplaced confidence should bear the loss cannot prevail over the specific statutory provision of Article 559 [15].

The decision of the lower court awarding the car to Santos is **AFFIRMED**. [16]
