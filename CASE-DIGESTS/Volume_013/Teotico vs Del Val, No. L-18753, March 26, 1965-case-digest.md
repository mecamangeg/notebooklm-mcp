I. CAPTION
VICENTE B. TEOTICO v. ANA DEL VAL, ETC., G.R. No. L-18753, March 26, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Maria Mortera y Balsalobre Vda. de Aguirre died leaving a will executed in Manila, disposing of properties worth P600,000.00 [1]. Among the bequests was a legacy of P20,000.00 to Dr. Rene A. Teotico, the physician who attended to her, and the usufruct of her interest in the Calvo building to him and his wife, Josefina Mortera (testatrix's niece), with naked ownership to their children [2]. Josefina was instituted as sole and universal heir [2].

Vicente B. Teotico filed a petition for probate [3]. Ana del Val Chan opposed the probate, claiming to be an adopted child of Francisca Mortera (testatrix's deceased sister) and an acknowledged natural child of Jose Mortera (testatrix's deceased brother) [3]. She alleged the will was not properly executed, was made under duress, and that the legacy to Dr. Teotico was void as he was the attending physician [3], [4].

The Court of First Instance of Manila admitted the will to probate but declared the legacy to Dr. Teotico void, ruling that the vacated portion should pass to the legal heirs [4]. Both parties appealed: Teotico on the nullification of the legacy, and del Val on the admission of the will to probate [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Ana del Val Chan has the legal personality to intervene in the probate proceedings.
2. W/N the will was duly admitted to probate.
3. W/N the probate court erred in passing upon the intrinsic validity of the testamentary provisions (specifically the legacy to Dr. Teotico).

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under the Rules of Court, only an "interested person"—one who would be benefited by the estate, such as an heir, or one who has a claim against it—may intervene [6], [7]. Ana del Val Chan has no such interest.
   First, as the acknowledged natural child of the testatrix's brother, she is barred by Article 992 of the Civil Code from succeeding the legitimate relatives of her natural father [8]. An illegitimate child has no right to inherit *ab intestato* from the legitimate children and relatives of their father or mother [8].
   Second, as the adopted child of the testatrix's sister, she is not an heir of the testatrix. Under Philippine law, the relationship established by adoption is limited solely to the adopter and the adopted and does not extend to the relatives of the adopting parents [9]. Since she would not inherit even if the will were denied probate, she lacks the legal standing to intervene [10], [11].

2. **YES.** The evidence conclusively proved that the will was signed by the testatrix and her instrumental witnesses in the presence of each other and the notary public, in accordance with law [12]. The claim of improper pressure and undue influence was not supported by substantial evidence [13]. The burden of proof is on the person challenging the will, and mere opportunity to exert pressure is insufficient to destroy the testatrix's free agency [13].

3. **YES.** The probate court exceeded its jurisdiction. Opposition to the intrinsic validity or legality of the provisions of the will cannot be entertained in probate proceedings [14]. The only purpose of probate is to determine if the will has been executed in accordance with the requirements of the law and if the testator had the necessary capacity [14], [15]. The validity of specific legacies or provisions remains unaffected by probate and may be raised in appropriate proceedings later [16]. Furthermore, Dr. Teotico was not even allowed to intervene to defend the validity of the legacy [17].

**Disposition:** The decision is SET ASIDE, except for the portion admitting the will to probate which is affirmed. The case is REMANDED to the court *a quo* for further proceedings [18].
