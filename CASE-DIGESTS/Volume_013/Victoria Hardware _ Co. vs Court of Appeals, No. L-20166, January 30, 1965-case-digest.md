I. CAPTION
VICTORIA HARDWARE & COMPANY v. COURT OF APPEALS and MAX CHAMORRO, ET AL., No. L-20166, January 30, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Victoria Hardware & Company filed a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court complaining of the Court of Appeals' alleged "excessive liberality" in granting extensions of time to respondent Max Chamorro [1]. However, during the proceedings, a final judgment in the main case was rendered in favor of the petitioner [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for certiorari has become moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that since a final judgment was already rendered in favor of the petitioner, the instant petition for certiorari regarding the extensions granted to the respondent is evidentially moot and academic [1]. The Court dismissed the petition without pronouncement as to costs [1].
