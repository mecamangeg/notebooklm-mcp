I. CAPTION
FAUSTO PANGILINAN v. RICE AND CORN ADMINISTRATION, G.R. No. L-22010, February 27, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Fausto Pangilinan was a warehouseman for the National Rice and Corn Corporation (NARIC). In 1958, he was charged with shortages in his cash and accountability amounting to over P25,000. After an investigation, the NARIC Board of Directors issued Resolution No. 30 finding him guilty of dishonesty and dismissing him from service [2-4].

NARIC was subsequently abolished and its functions transferred to the Rice and Corn Administration (RCA). The RCA furnished Pangilinan a copy of the dismissal resolution. Pangilinan filed a motion for reconsideration, which the RCA Board of Administrators denied via Resolution No. 58, stating that a hearing had been conducted in accordance with due process [5, 6].

Instead of appealing further administratively, Pangilinan filed a petition for certiorari, mandamus, and damages with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Tarlac. He alleged that the dismissal was null and void for lack of a hearing. The CFI dismissed the petition for failure to exhaust administrative remedies [2, 7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies before resorting to court action. [8]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. Under Section 5 of Republic Act 3452, the power of the RCA to discipline employees is expressly made "subject to the Civil Service Law" [9, 10].

The Civil Service Act of 1959 (R.A. 2260), specifically Section 16(i) and (j), grants the Commissioner of Civil Service the final authority to pass upon the removal and separation of employees and to hear appeals from aggrieved parties. Therefore, after the RCA denied his motion for reconsideration, the petitioner still had an available administrative remedy: an appeal to the Civil Service Commissioner [10-12].

The Court rejected the petitioner's claim of "patent illegality" to justify non-exhaustion. The resolutions attached to the petition explicitly stated that an investigation and hearing were conducted, contradicting the petitioner's claim that he was denied due process. Since there was no patent illegality, the petitioner was required to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief. The order appealed from is affirmed [13, 14]
