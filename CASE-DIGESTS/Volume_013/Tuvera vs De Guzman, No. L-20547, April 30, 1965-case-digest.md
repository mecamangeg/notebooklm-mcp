I. CAPTION
CIPRIANO TUVERA and ROMAN MARQUEZ v. HON. PASTOR DE GUZMAN, HON. TOMAS P. PANGANIBAN and ASUNCION V. SANCHEZ, G.R. No. L-20547, April 30, 1965, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
On October 13, 1961, respondent Asuncion V. Sanchez filed a suit for liquidation, injunction, and ejectment against petitioners Cipriano Tuvera and Roman Marquez in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). Sanchez alleged that the petitioners were share-tenants on her agricultural land who appropriated the harvest for themselves and refused to deliver her share [1]. Tuvera filed an answer claiming ownership over the land, while Marquez was declared in default (later lifted) [2]. During the proceedings, the petitioners filed a separate suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan against Sanchez on March 15, 1962, asserting their ownership over the property [3]. Consequently, they filed a motion to dismiss the CAR case, arguing that the CFI suit removed the case from the CAR's jurisdiction [4]. The CAR proceeded to render judgment authorizing Sanchez to eject the petitioners [5]. Petitioners appealed, contending that the filing of the ownership case in the CFI divested the CAR of its jurisdiction.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations lost jurisdiction over the ejectment case due to the petitioners' claim of ownership and the subsequent filing of a suit in the Court of First Instance.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court of Agrarian Relations retained its jurisdiction. The Supreme Court held that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint [6]. Since the complaint set forth a cause of action for dispossession of a tenant by a landholder, the case fell within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the CAR [6]. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Mandih vs. Tablantin* that a defendant's denial of tenancy and claim of ownership does not divest the Agrarian Court of jurisdiction [6].

Furthermore, the filing of a suit to litigate ownership in the Court of First Instance *after* the CAR had already acquired jurisdiction did not divest the latter of its authority. Citing *States Marine Corporation vs. Cebu Seamen’s Association*, the Court applied the axiom that once a court acquires jurisdiction, it continues until the case is terminated [7]. The evidence also supported the finding that petitioners were tenants, as Sanchez held a valid Transfer Certificate of Title, whereas the title relied upon by petitioners had been cancelled in 1928 [7, 8].

**Petition denied. Judgment affirmed.**
