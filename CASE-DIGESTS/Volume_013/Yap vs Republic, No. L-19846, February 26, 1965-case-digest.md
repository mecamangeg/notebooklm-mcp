I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF JUAN YAP TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. JUAN YAP v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19846, February 26, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Juan Yap filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental. The petitioner was employed as a weigher for Western Products, Co., Inc., earning P150.00 per month. He did not own any real estate and had a wife and three children to support. The trial court granted his petition. The Solicitor General appealed the decision, arguing that the petitioner did not possess a lucrative trade or occupation and that his witnesses were not credible [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation to qualify for naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner's income of P150.00 a month is insufficient to warrant the conclusion that he has a lucrative trade, particularly considering that he has to support a wife and three children [3]. The Court relied on established jurisprudence in *Ong v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-15754), *Jew Chong v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-14343), and *Tan v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-14860) regarding the insufficiency of such income for naturalization purposes [3].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is REVERSED [4].
