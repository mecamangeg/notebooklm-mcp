I. CAPTION
CANDIDO SAN LUIS v. BENJAMIN B. PINEDA, Adm. Case No. 205, March 31, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Benjamin B. Pineda was disbarred in July 1940. Complainant Candido San Luis filed a complaint alleging that Pineda continued to practice law a few months prior to December 1941 despite his disbarment. Additionally, the complainant noted that Pineda was convicted of robbery in 1953, and although conditionally pardoned, the moral stain remained. The matter was referred to the Solicitor General, who found that Pineda indeed practiced law in Jolo during the latter part of 1941, but there was no evidence of legal practice after that year. Supreme Court records confirmed that Pineda had never been readmitted to the Bar.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent should be held in contempt for practicing law after his disbarment.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the practice of law by one who is disbarred constitutes contempt of court, citing *U.S. v. Ney* and *People v. De Luna* [1]. However, considering that the proven unauthorized practice occurred in 1941, which the Court deemed "too far away," it adopted the Solicitor General's recommendation for leniency [1]. Accordingly, the respondent was **WARNED** not to engage in the legal profession again until he is regularly readmitted thereto [1].
