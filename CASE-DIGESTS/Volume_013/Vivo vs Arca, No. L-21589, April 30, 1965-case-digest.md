I. CAPTION
HON. MARTINIANO VIVO, in his capacity as Acting Commissioner of Immigration v. HON. FRANCISCO ARCA, in his capacity as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, et al., G.R. No. L-21589, April 30, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Judge Arca (CFI Manila) rendered a decision in a prohibition case enjoining Petitioner Acting Commissioner of Immigration Vivo from deporting two aliens and declaring them Filipino citizens. The decision was served on the Solicitor General (Petitioner's counsel) on April 2, 1963. On April 17, the Solicitor General filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied by Vacation Judge Tizon. The denial was received on May 22, 1963, and the Solicitor General filed a Notice of Appeal on May 24, 1963.

Judge Tizon initially ordered the records elevated to the Supreme Court. However, upon motion by the private respondents, Judge Arca reconsidered and set aside the transmittal order, ruling that the decision had become final and executory. The Court found that the appeal was perfected on the 16th day (14 days elapsed before the MR + 2 days after notice of denial), exceeding the 15-day reglementary period for prohibition cases. Petitioner sought Mandamus to compel the lower court to give due course to the appeal, arguing that Judge Tizon’s initial order impliedly extended the appeal period and that the lower court lost jurisdiction to dismiss the appeal after ordering the records transmitted.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court’s mistake in initially approving the appeal impliedly extended the period to appeal.
2. W/N the trial court retained jurisdiction to dismiss the appeal after initially ordering the transmittal of records to the appellate court.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The period to appeal cannot be impliedly extended by the mistake of the lower court in taking for granted that the appeal notice was timely. The Supreme Court held that extensions must be asked for before the expiration of the original period (*Alejandro vs. Endencia*, 64 Phil. 321). In this case, no extension was requested, and the explanation for the delay (excusable negligence) was submitted nearly 20 days after the expiration of the appeal period. Since the appeal was filed on the 16th day—beyond the 15-day period prescribed by Section 17, Rule 41—the judgment had become final.

2. **YES.** The trial court has jurisdiction to annul an order to forward records and dismiss an appeal if the notice was filed late, provided the records have not yet been transmitted. Citing Section 14 of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, the Supreme Court ruled that a motion to dismiss an appeal may be filed in the trial court *prior to the transmittal* of the record. Since the petitioner was still seeking to compel the elevation of records, they had evidently not been transmitted, and Judge Arca acted within his jurisdiction.

The petition for Certiorari and Mandamus was **DENIED**.
