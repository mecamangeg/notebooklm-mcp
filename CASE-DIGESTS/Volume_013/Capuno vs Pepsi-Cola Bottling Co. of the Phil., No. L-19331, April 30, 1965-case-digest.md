I. CAPTION
VICTORIA G. CAPUNO and JOSEPHINE G. CAPUNO v. PEPSI-COLA BOTTLING COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES and JON ELORDI, G.R. No. L-19331, April 30, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On January 3, 1953, a collision occurred in Apalit, Pampanga between a Pepsi-Cola truck driven by Jon Elordi and a car driven by Cipriano Capuno, resulting in the death of Capuno and his passengers [1]. On January 5, 1953, a criminal case for triple homicide through reckless imprudence was filed against Elordi [2]. The heirs of Capuno (plaintiffs-appellants) initially intervened in the criminal case to claim damages, but their appearance was disallowed [3, 4]. On September 26, 1958, while the criminal case was still pending, the appellants filed a separate civil action for damages against Pepsi-Cola and Elordi [5]. The Court of First Instance of Tarlac dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription [1, 6]. Appellants appealed, arguing that the filing of the criminal action interrupted the prescriptive period for the civil action [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the civil action for damages based on quasi-delict has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the action had prescribed. An action for recovery of damages based on a quasi-delict must be instituted within four years pursuant to Article 1146 of the Civil Code [8]. The prescriptive period begins to run from the day the quasi-delict occurred or was committed, which in this case was January 3, 1953 [9, 10].

The Court held that the institution of a criminal action does not interrupt the running of the prescriptive period for a civil action based on quasi-delict [7]. Under Articles 31 and 33 of the Civil Code, a civil action for damages arising from physical injuries (which includes death) is entirely separate and independent from the criminal action and may proceed regardless of the latter's result [10, 11]. Since the appellants filed their complaint only on September 26, 1958—more than five years after the accident—the claim was already barred by the statute of limitations [10].

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [12].
