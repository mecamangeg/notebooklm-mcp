I. CAPTION
CONSTANTE V. ALZATE v. GENERAL HEADQUARTERS EFFICIENCY AND SEPARATION BOARD OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16572, February 27, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Constante V. Alzate was a reserve officer in the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) with the rank of Major and had over ten years of active accumulated commissioned service [1]. The respondent General Headquarters Efficiency and Separation Board (GHESB-AFP) summoned him for an investigation regarding alleged estafa and civil obligations to determine his fitness to remain in active service [2]. Alzate filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, arguing that under Section 1 of Republic Act No. 1382, reserve officers with his length of service could not be "reverted into inactive status" except for cause after court-martial proceedings [3, 4]. The CFI ruled in favor of Alzate, declaring the Board without jurisdiction to investigate him for separation, holding that the statutory protection against reversion applied [5]. The Board appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the GHESB-AFP has jurisdiction to investigate a reserve officer covered by RA 1382 for the purpose of separation from the service.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the prohibition in RA 1382 applies only to "reversion to inactive status" and does not cover investigation for separation, discharge, or dismissal [7].

The Court distinguished "reversion" from "separation," citing *Paz v. Alcaraz*, noting that reversion merely transfers an officer from active to inactive duty while they remain an officer of the reserve force, whereas separation removes them from the service entirely [8]. The Court reasoned that RA 1382 was not intended to grant reserve officers greater security of tenure than regular officers, who are subject to administrative discharge for incompetence or inefficiency under laws such as Executive Order No. 302, RA 340, and Article 117 of the Articles of War [9, 10]. To hold otherwise would limit the President's power of removal only to causes specified in the Articles of War punishable by court-martial [11]. Consequently, the Board has jurisdiction to investigate Alzate for the purpose of separation.

The decision of the lower court is reversed [12].
